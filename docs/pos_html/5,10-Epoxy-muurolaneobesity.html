Anthropometric measurements, body composition (BIA), aerobic capacity (VO2 max) and food preferences were assessed in 19 healthy normal-weight young adults (21 ± 0. years old, 10 men). They randomly completed 3 experimental sessions: i) control session without exercise (CON); ii) High Intensity exercise session (HIE); iii) Low intensity exercise session (LIE). Thirty minutes after exercise or rest, then received a fixed lunch. Food reward (Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire) was assessed before and after the meal. Appetite sensations were assessed at regular intervals, SQ was calculated from the lunch meal and self-reported food intake was collected for the rest of the day. Mean body weight was 66.7 ± 9.2 kg, body mass index was 22.3 ± 2.9 kg/m and FM% was 18.7 ± 6.8%. Appetite feelings did not differ between conditions and were not affected by exercise. SQ for satiety was not different between conditions. SQ hunger on CON was significantly higher than on LIE and HIE (p ≤ 0.05) with no difference between exercise conditions. SQ for desire to eat was significantly higher on CON versus HIE (p ≤ 0.01) with no differences between CON and LIE and between exercise sessions. SQ PFC was significantly lower on HIE compared with CON (p = 0.02) with no differences between LIE and CON and between LIE and HIE. Food reward was not significantly different between the three condition as well as self-reported total food and macronutrient intake for the rest of the days. Acute exercise, depending on its intensity, might affect the satiating response to food intake in healthy adults, without altering food reward.Copyright © 2019.

This was a cross-sectional study at a tertiary care center. Adults with class III  referred to the Bariatric Program completed the exercise benefits/barriers scale, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short-Form, and the Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire. Participants were asked to list additional exercise barriers.  The 80 participants engaged in a median of 699.0 MET-minutes/week of physical activity, and were sedentary 10.4 ± 4. hours/day. The mean exercise benefits/barriers score was 126.3 ± 12.8 (barrier score = 31.6 ± .3, benefit score = 87.8 ± 9.4). Less than 60% identified exercise as enjoyable, or a form of social interaction. More than 60% identified exercise barriers related to physical exertion. Additional barriers included pain and musculoskeletal comorbidities (39.4%), psychological factors (14.7%), and weight (12.6%). There was no statistically significant association between exercise barriers and sedentary behavior (p = .69) or physical activity (p = .08).  Participants reported low physical activity, with high sedentary behavior and exercise barriers. Physical exertion, pain and musculoskeletal comorbidities were common barriers, which highlights importance of thoughtful exercise with attention to exercise barriers in this population .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659319> has limited behavioural overlap with addiction and psychiatric phenotypes.</a></h1><p> is a widespread health condition, likely to be driven by the increased availability of inexpensive high-calorie food.

This study aimed to assess the risk of SA and occupational factors such as occupational classification, working hours, and work schedules among working Korean women aged > 19 years.In this cross-sectional study, 4078 working women were identified from among 25,534 workers in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys V (2010-2012) database, to obtain data on SA history and the number of SAs. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for SA were calculated using multiple logistic regression models after adjusting for age, education, household income, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and  status. The weighted prevalence for the number of SAs was calculated according to occupational characteristics to demonstrate the SA status among working Korean women.SA occurrence was reported in .7% of the study participants. The ORs (95% CIs) for SA were significantly higher in pink-, green-, and blue-collared workers than in white-collared workers. Regarding weekly working hours, compared with ≤50 h spent working, the ORs (95% CIs) for 51-60, 61-70, and > 70 h per week were 1.26 (0.87-1.84), 1.63 (1.04-2.56), and 1.73 (1.10-2.70), respectively. A significantly higher weighted prevalence of repeat SAs was observed in pink- and green-collared workers and in those who worked long hours.We found a significant association between SA, repeat SA, and occupational characteristics among working Korean women.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658012>Peritoneal dialysis catheter removal at the time of renal transplantation: Choosing the optimal candidate.</a></h1><p>Concurrent peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter removal during renal transplantation is controversial, with limited evidence supporting this practice. Our objective was to determine the rate of delayed graft function (DGF) in patients on preoperative PD. Additionally, we sought to identify which patients can safely have their PD catheter removed during transplantation due to a low risk of DGF.We conducted a retrospective observational study between June 2011 and December 2015. The primary outcome was the diagnosis of DGF, defined as the need for dialysis within the first week of transplantation. Clinical and transplant factors, including graft type and donor criteria, were assessed for association with the primary outcome. Catheter-related complication rates were also compared between post-transplant PD and hemodialysis (HD).Of our cohort of 567 patients, 145 patients (25.6%) developed DGF.  (odds ratio [OR] 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.11; p=0.04) and increased perioperative blood loss (OR 1.002; 95% CI 1.000-1.003; p=0.03) were predictors of DGF. Protective factors included living donor (LD) grafts (OR 0.15; 95% CI 0.05-0.49; p=0.002) and intraoperative graft urine production (OR 0.39; 95% CI 0.23-0.65; p<0.001). In our PD cohort, only LD grafts demonstrated lower DGF rates (0 LD vs. 20.8% deceased donor; p=0.003). In terms of post-transplant renal replacement therapy, patients on PD and HD had similar duration of temporary dialysis (one day PD vs. two days HD; p=0.48) and catheter-related complication rates (4.% PD vs. 2.6% HD; p=0.30).Carefully selected patients, such as those receiving LD grafts, may benefit from concurrent PD catheter removal.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675433>Simultaneous angiotensin receptor blockade and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor activation ameliorate albuminuria in obese insulin-resistant rats.</a></h1><p>Insulin resistance increases renal oxidant production by up-regulating NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) expression contributing to oxidative damage and ultimately albuminuria. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and activation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor signaling may reverse this effect. However, whether angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1) blockade and GLP-1 receptor activation improve oxidative damage and albuminuria through different mechanisms is not known. Using insulin resistant Otsuka Long Evan Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, we tested the hypothesis that simultaneous blockade of AT1 and activation of GLP-1r additively decrease oxidative damage and urinary albumin excretion (U V) in the following groups: (1) untreated, lean LETO (n=7), (2) untreated, obese OLETF (n=9), (3) OLETF + angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB; 10 mg olmesartan /kg/d; n=9), (4) OLETF + GLP-1 mimetic (EXE; 10 ug exenatide/kg/d; n=7), and () OLETF + ARB + exenatide (Combo; n=6). Mean kidney Nox4 protein expression and nitrotyrosine (NT) levels were 30% and 46% greater, respectively, in OLETF compared to LETO. Conversely, Nox4 protein expression and NT were reduced to LETO levels in ARB and EXE, and Combo reduced Nox4, NT, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal levels by 21%, 27%, and 27%, respectively. At baseline, U V was nearly double in OLETF compared to LETO, and increased to nearly 10-fold greater levels by the end of the study. While ARB (45%) and EXE (55%) individually reduced U V, the combination completely ameliorated the albuminuria. Collectively, these data suggest that AT1 blockade and GLP-1 receptor activation reduce renal oxidative damage similarly during insulin resistance, while targeting both signaling pathways provides added benefit in restoring and/or further ameliorating albuminuria in a model of diet-induced .© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659873>Muscle Insulin Resistance in Youth with  and Normoglycemia is Associated with Altered Fat Metabolism.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to phenotype and compare adipose, hepatic, and muscle insulin sensitivity (IS) in a diet- and physical activity-controlled cohort of normoglycemic youth with  with that of participants without  (controls) to distinguish early metabolic abnormalities in pediatric .Thirty-eight participants (17 in the control group [BMI < 85th percentile] and 21 youth with  [BMI ≥ 95th percentile]; age: 12-21 years; 76% female; Tanner stage 4-; sedentary) were enrolled. Tissue-specific IS was measured using a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess suppression of endogenous glucose release and lipolysis by insulin. Intramyocellular lipid content was assessed by  H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hepatic fat fraction (HFF) and visceral fat were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with  had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral fat (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular lipid content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003). Mitochondria postexercise response was not different. In participants with , muscle IS inversely correlated with HFF (r = 0.700, P = 0.002) and suppressed free fatty acid concentrations (r = -0.65, P = 0.003).Inactive normoglycemic youth with  had decreased muscle, adipose, and hepatic IS.

Predicting its progression could help clinicians manage and potentially prevent complications. We evaluated the independent and joint effects of metabolic traits on the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients with NAFLD. We assembled a retrospective cohort of patients with NAFLD diagnosed at 130 facilities in the Veterans Administration between 1/1/2004 and 12/31/2008 with follow-up through 12/31/2015. We performed competing risk, adjusted cause-specific Cox models to evaluate the effects of metabolic traits (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, ) as additive or combined indicators on time to develop cirrhosis or HCC or a composite endpoint of both. Of the 271,906 patients, 22,794 developed cirrhosis, and 253 developed HCC during a mean of 9 years follow up. At baseline, the mean BMI was 31.6 (SD, .6), 28.7% had diabetes, 70.3% hypertension, and 62.3% had dyslipidemia with substantial overlap among the these traits. The risk of progression was the lowest in patients with only one or no metabolic trait. There was a stepwise increase in risk with each additional metabolic trait. Compared to patients with no metabolic trait, patients with both hypertension and dyslipidemia had 1.8-fold higher risk of progression to cirrhosis/HCC (hazard ratio (HR) =1.8, 95% CI=1.59-2.06); the risk was 2.6-fold higher in patients with diabetes, , dyslipidemia and hypertension (HR=2.6, 95% CI=2.3,2.9). These associations were stronger for HCC. Diabetes had the strongest association with HCC in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Each additional metabolic trait increased the risk of cirrhosis and HCC in patients with NAFLD. Diabetes conferred the highest risk of progression to HCC.

Since the role of cardiac steatosis  in the induction of AF has not been elucidated, the present study was designed to explore the relation between cardiac steatosis and AF. Transgenic (Tg) mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of perilipin 2 (PLIN2) were housed in the laboratory for more than 12 months before the study. Electron microscopy of the atrium of PLIN2-Tg mice showed accumulation of small lipid droplets around mitochondrial chains, and - to 9-fold greater atrial triacylglycerol (TAG) content compared to wildtype (Wt) mice. Electrocardiography showed significantly longer RR intervals in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice. Transesophageal electrical burst pacing resulted in significantly higher prevalence of sustained (> min) AF (69%) in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice (24%), although it was comparable in younger (4-month-old) mice. Connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein, was localized at the intercalated discs in Wt atria, but was heterogeneously distributed on the lateral side of cardiomyocytes in PLIN2-Tg atria. Langendorff-perfused hearts using the optical mapping technique showed slower and heterogeneous impulse propagation in PLIN2-Tg atria compared with Wt atria. Cardiac overexpression of hormone-sensitive lipase in PLIN2-Tg mice resulted in atrial TAG depletion and amelioration of AF susceptibility. The results suggest that PLIN2-induced steatosis is associated with Cx43 remodeling, impaired conduction propagation, and higher incidence of AF in aged mice. Therapies targeting cardiac steatosis could be potentially beneficial against AF in patients with  or diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672599>Heptamethoxyflavone inhibits adipogenesis via enhancing PKA signaling.</a></h1><p>3,,6,7,8,3',4'-heptamethoxyflavone (HMF), a naturally occurring polymethoxyflavone found in citrus peel, is known to have neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. However, the effects of HMF on adipogenesis remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that HMF inhibits the early stage of adipogenesis and maturation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. HMF treatment during preadipocyte differentiation for 8 days reduced lipid accumulation in a dose-dependent manner, and the expression levels of key adipogenic transcription factors (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα)) and the lipogenic transcription factor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP1), were lower after the initial 4 days of the differentiation. Moreover, PPARγ expression level was lower even after the initial 2 days, but C/EBPα and SREBP1 expression was not. HMF upregulated the phosphorylation of protein kinase A catalytic subunit α (PKACα), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in 3T3-L1 cells. The phosphorylation of ACC leads to the inhibition of adipogenesis. Furthermore, the induction of phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC by HMF was abolished by RNA interference targeting PKACα. Taken together, our results suggest that HMF might inhibit the early stage of adipogenesis via the activation of PKA signaling in 3T3-L1 cells.Copyright © 2019.

Several studies showed that irisin involves in thermogenesis and increases the expression of browning markers such as uncoupling protein-1 that in turns induces the conversion of white adipose tissue to brown fat. Resveratrol (Res) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) can also upregulate the expression of thermogenesis genes. In the present study, the effects of single and combined treatments of Res and ATRA on fibronectin type III domain containing  (FNDC5) gene expression was explored.The mouse myoblasts, C2C12 cells, were seeded in 6-well plastic plates and cultured in DMEM media. After differentiation, in a pilot study, C2C12 myotubes were treated with different concentrations of Res and ATRA for 12 h. The best result was obtained by treatment of 1and 25 μM of Res and 1 μM of ATRA. Then the main study was continued by single and combined treatment of these compounds at chosen concentration. After treatments, total RNA was extracted from C2C12 cells. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated by the cDNA synthesis kit and FNDC5 mRNA expression was evaluated by the real-time PCR method.The FNDC5 gene expression in C2C12 myotubes of alone-treated with 1 μM, 25 μM Res and 10 μM ATRA did not change compared to vehicle group. However, in combination-treated the expression of FNDC5 gene was significantly increased compared to vehicle group.This is the first evidence that Res and ATRA can regulate FNDC5 gene expression in C2C12 myotubes.

However, the proper body size adjustment for muscle quantity is debated and sarcopenia in  is not well described. Further, functional measures are not muscle-specific or sensitive to etiology, and can be confounded by, for example, fitness/pain. For effective detection/treatment/follow-up, muscle-specific biomarkers linked to function are needed.Nine thousand six hundred and fifteen participants were included and current sarcopenia thresholds (EWGSOP2: DXA, hand grip strength) applied to investigate prevalence. Fat-tissue free muscle volume (FFMV) and muscle fat infiltration (MFI) were quantified through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and sex-and-body mass index (BMI)-matched virtual control groups (VCGs) were used to extract each participant's FFMV/height2 z-score (FFMVVCG). The value of combining FFMVVCG and MFI was investigated through hospital nights, hand grip strength, stair climbing, walking pace, and falls.Current thresholds showed decreased sarcopenia prevalence with increased BMI (underweight 8.%/normal weight 4.3%/overweight 1.1%/ 0.1%). Contrary, the prevalence of low function increased with increasing BMI. Previously proposed body size adjustments (division by height2/weight/BMI) introduced body size correlations of larger/similar magnitude than before. VCG adjustment achieved normalization and strengthened associations with hospitalization/function. Hospital nights, low hand grip strength, slow walking pace, and no stair climbing were positively associated with MFI (p < .05) and negatively associated with FFMVVCG (p < .01). Only MFI was associated with falls (p < .01). FFMVVCG and MFI combined resulted in highest diagnostic performance detecting low function.VCG-adjusted FFMV enables proper sarcopenia assessment across BMI classes and strengthened the link to function. MFI and FFMV combined provides a more complete, muscle-specific description linked to function enabling objective sarcopenia detection.© The Author(s) 2019.

BMI was derived from objectively measured heights and weights. Moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA), sedentary time (SED), and sleep duration were assessed by waist-worn Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers. Linear models were used to describe the distributions of BMI z-scores, MVPA, SED, and sleep among sites across varying Human Development Indices (HDIs).Mean MVPA, SED, and sleep duration were 63.1 ± 27.3 minutes/day, 508.7 ± 72.4 minutes/day, and 8.8 ± 0.9 hours/night, respectively. Overall, 2.1% of the sample were thin, 19.% overweight, and 11.7% were obese. Density curves (BMI z-scores and SED) for urban children in Mozambique showed significantly higher mean values compared with rural children. Boys had significantly higher mean MVPA compared with girls. Mean BMI z-scores were positively associated (β = .02; P = .004) with HDI, mean daily MVPA minutes were negatively associated (β = -.38; P = .025) with HDI, and mean SED time was positively associated with HDI (β = 1.18; P = .049). No significant association (β = .01; P = .29) was observed between sleep duration and HDI.Our findings show distinct differences in BMI and movement behavior profiles between urban and rural children in Mozambique. Mean BMI z-scores, MVPA, and SED differed by country HDI.

Major facilitator superfamily domain 3 (MFSD3) is a family of membrane-bound solute carriers whose expression has been recently associated with nutrient intake and adipose tissue homeostasis. This study aimed to evaluate a possible association between MFSD3 preoperative methylation pattern and weight regain after bariatric surgery.This is a longitudinal study comprising 24 obese (body mass index > 35 m/kg) women submitted to gastric bypass. Anthropometric measurements were evaluated at preoperative time and 1, 2, and 3 y after surgery, and then weight regain was calculated. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes and was bisulfite modified by specific kits, according manufacturer's instructions. Methylation analysis was performed with the Infinium Human Methylation 450 K bead chip technology, and methylation level was expressed as a β value ranging from 0 (unmethylated) to 1 (fully methylated). Shapiro-Wilk, repeated-means analysis of variance, Spearman correlation, Mann-Whitney, and independent t tests were used in statistical analysis (P < 0.05).A total of 25% of patients regained significant weight. Weight regain after bariatric surgery was positively correlated with cg00010266 MFSD3 preoperative methylation levels (r = 0.6804, P = 0.0126). Moreover, cg00010266 MFSD3 baseline methylation levels were significantly higher in regainer patients than non-regainers (6.2 ± 1. versus 3.9 ± 1.2%, P = 0.026). Patients allocated in the higher cg00010266 MFSD3 preoperative methylation group had higher weight regain (4.1 ± 1.8 versus 6.7 ± 2.2 kg, P = 0.037).Preoperative hypermethylation of MFSD3 gene is significantly associated with weight regain and a worse response to gastric bypass.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In vivo administration antagonized weight increase, more so in males than in females. Analysis of inguinal White Adipose Tissue (WAT) revealed a trend towards browning, with significantly increased transcription of several marker genes (, , , , , and ) and an increase in UCP1 protein levels, which, however, did not achieve significance.

However, the association between central  and LSBE has not been well investigated in Asia. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between central  and LSBE in the Japanese population.A total of 38,298 healthy subjects who took medical surveys between April 2006 and November 2018 were enrolled. We investigated the association between LSBE and central  indices [visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and the VAT to SAT ratio (VAT/SAT)] using a multivariable logistic regression model.A total of 37,686 subjects were eligible for the analysis. LSBE rates in the middle and high VAT/SAT groups were higher than those in the low VAT/SAT group [odds ratio (OR) 1.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-2.69 for middle vs low; OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.17-3.49 for high vs low). These associational trends between VAT/SAT and LSBE remained in subgroups with and without reflux esophagitis. From subgroup analyses by SAT, we found that the OR between VAT and LSBE is higher in the low SAT subgroup (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.34-4.40 for middle vs low; OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.01-6.40 for high vs low); but not large or imprecise due to limited event numbers in the middle and high SAT subgroups.VAT was associated with LSBE, especially among subjects with low SAT accumulation, who are seemingly not obese.

This study aims to assess a cross-section of truckers in South Africa to describe their health information.The study took place across three truck-stop rest areas in the South African provinces of Free State and Gauteng.Eligibility criteria included being males aged 18 years and older, full-time employment as a long-distance truck driver. A total of 614 male truck drivers participated; 384 (63%) were Zimbabwean and 325 (55%) completed high-school.The trucker survey explored demographics; working conditions; sexual, eating and sleeping behaviours; mental health status, medical history and cardiac risk-factors. Medical assessments included physical measurements, glucose and lipid measurements, ECG, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and cardiac ultrasound.In the previous month, 554 (91%) participants were sexually active; 522 (86%) had sex with a regular partner; 174 (27%) with a casual partner; 87 (14%) with a sex worker. Average time driving was 10 hours/day, 20 days/month, 302 (50%) never worked night shifts and 74 (12%) worked nights approximately four times per week. 112 (18%) experienced daytime sleepiness and 59 (10%) were ever hospitalised from an accident. Forty-seven (8%, 95% CI .3 to 9.) were HIV-positive, with half taking antiretrovirals. Forty-eight (8%) truckers had some moderate depression, while 21 (4%) suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. Reported tuberculosis, myocardial infarction, and diabetes were <3%. Prominent cardiac risk-factors included smoking (n=63, 11%), consuming alcohol (>15 drinks/week) (n=54, 9%), overweight/ (n=417, 69%), and hypertension (n=220, 36%,95% CI 32.1 to 39.7). ECG results showed 23 (4.9%) and 29 (.3%) drivers had left ventricular hypertrophy using the Cornell criterion and product, respectively. CIMT measurements indicated nine (4.2%) drivers had a carotid atherosclerotic plaque.This first holistic assessment of health among southern African male truck drivers demonstrates substantial addressable cardiovascular risk factors, mental health issues and sexual risk behaviours.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Sargaquinoic acid (SQA) is a major component in MES. We investigated the effects of SQA on the differentiation of preadipocytes to the beige adipocytes. SQA was treated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiated under a special condition that has been reported to induce the browning of adipocytes. SQA at 10 µM reduced lipid accumulation by approximately 23%. SQA at 2. - 10 µM induced the differentiation of white adipocytes to beige adipocytes partially by increasing the mitochondrial density and the expression of beige/brown adipocyte markers. In addition, SQA activated lipid catabolic pathways, evidenced by the increased expression levels of perilipin, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1. As a partial mechanism, biochemical and  analyses indicate that SQA activated AMP-activated protein kinase signaling in adipocytes.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648979>Preoperative versus intraoperative diagnosis of hiatal hernia in bariatric population.</a></h1><p>Hiatal hernia is frequently encountered intraoperatively during bariatric surgery. There is scarce research pertaining to the diagnostic accuracy of a preoperative diagnostic modality in comparison to intraoperative diagnosis, along with patient characteristics and related factors contributing to hiatal hernia.To identify the prevalence and associations of hiatal hernia in the bariatric patient population, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of upper gastrointestinal series and esophagogastroduodenoscopy with the intraoperative findings across various patient characteristics.Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program, Teaching Hospital, New York, USA.Retrospective study of patients from 2015 to 2018 who met National Institutes of Health criteria for bariatric surgery.There were 1094 patients included (135 males, 959 females), with an age range of 18 to 74 years. The diagnostic accuracy was determined by a sensitivity of 64.71% (95% confidence interval [CI] .55-.70), specificity of 74.38% (95% CI .71-.70), positive predictive value of 29.86% (95% CI .24-.30), negative predictive value of 92.59% (95%CI .89-90), likelihood ratio of 2.526, and P value < .0001 for esophagogastroduodenoscopy; a sensitivity of 14.02% (95% CI .08-0), specificity of 98.23% (95% CI .96-.90), positive predictive value of 71.43% (95% CI .50-.80), negative predictive value of 78.35% (95% CI .74-.80), likelihood ratio 7.921, and P value < .0001 were used for upper gastrointestinal series. Hiatal hernia with age <60 years was 17.09% versus 48.44% at >60 years (P < .0001). Hiatal hernia incidence was 17% in Hispanics, 22.% in Caucasians, and 23.10% in blacks.The prevalence of hiatal hernia is 18.92%. There is strong association between hiatal hernia and age and ethnicity and no association based on sex and body mass index. The diagnostic accuracy of upper gastrointestinal series is very low compared with that of esophagogastroduodenoscopy for hiatal hernia. Preoperative diagnosis of hiatal hernia in the bariatric population is not required based on our study. Not only does it lessen the economic burden, patient wait time, and discomfort of an additional study, but preoperative diagnosis does not change, alter, or aid in the intraoperative management of hiatal hernia considering the suboptimal accuracy of preoperative diagnostics, thus deeming them unwarranted.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Bariatric Surgery.

We did baseline (2005-2007) and two follow-up surveys in 2008-2009 and 2013-2015. Risk factors studied were tobacco, alcohol, hypertension, self-reported diabetes and central .Outcome measures were fatal or non-fatal ischaemic heart disease or cerebrovascular event. We estimated HRs for the risk factors and population attributable fraction (PAF).We followed up 5641 (94.4%) subjects, and follow-up duration was 33 371 person years. The overall incidence of cardiovascular event or death was 4.6 per 1000 person years. Current smoking (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.6) and hypertension (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1. to 3.4) were the risk factors among men and accounted for 47% of the PAF.

The associations between prediagnostic total WCC and its subtypes and risk of all-cause, cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality were assessed. The role of WCC related with smoking and BMI on mortality was further explored. Multivariate Cox regression models were performed to estimate the HR and 95% CI.After an average follow-up of 15.8 years, a total of 936 death cases were identified (466 cancer; 179 CVD; 291 other causes). Statistically significant graded associations between total WCC, and counts of lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils and risk of total mortality were observed. These associations were more apparent in current smokers. Strong associations for all-cause mortality or cancer mortality were observed in subjects with BMI ≥25 kg/m, ever smoking and elevated WCC (HR 3.92, 95% CI 2.76 to .57; HR 3.93, 95% CI 2.30 to 6.72).

The micro strains on the femur during single-leg stance of gait were measured on critical stress points based on the Gruen femoral zones.The micro strains increase as the weight increases implying that the displacement in the hip joint endoprosthesis is higher for overweight subjects enhancing the risk of failure. The highest increase was measured in Gruen zone 1 by .60% indicating that the great trochanter is subjected to higher stress shielding with increasing the weight. Also, the statistically significant increase of the micro strain values with increasing the weight in Gruen Zones 3 (2.91%),  (1.56%), and 11 (1.75%) may enhance the risk for a periprosthetic fracture at the lower region of the prosthesis.This is the first biomechanical study which quantifies the effect of increasing weight loading conditions on the mechanical environment of the hip joint endoprosthesis considering different positions of evaluation.Copyright © 2019.

This study aimed to evaluate whether a higher oxygen saturation target would increase arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO in obese patients after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG).Obese patients having CABG were recruited. With a randomized crossover design, we compared two oxygenation strategies for 30 min each, immediately after extubation: a peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO) target of ≥ 95% achieved with manual oxygen titration (liberal) and a SpO target of 90% achieved with FreeO, an automated oxygen titration device (conservative). The main outcome was end-of-period arterial PaCO.Thirty patients were included. Mean (standard deviation [SD]) body mass index (BMI) was 34 (3) kg·m and mean (SD) baseline partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO) was 40.7 (3.1) mmHg. Mean (SD) end-of-period PaCO was 42.0 (.4) mmHg in the conservative period, compared with 42.6 (4.6) mmHg in the liberal period [mean difference - 0.6 (95% confidence interval - 2.2 to 0.9) mmHg; P = 0.4]. Adjusted analysis for age, BMI, narcotics, and preoperative PaCO did not substantively change the results. Fourteen patients were retainers, showing an elevation in mean (SD) PaCO in the liberal period of 3.3 (4.1) mmHg. Eleven patients had the opposite response, with a mean (SD) end-of-period PaCO decrease of 1.8 (2.2) mmHg in the liberal period. Five patients had a neutral response.This study did not show a clinically important increase in PaCO associated with higher SpO values in this specific population of obese patients after CABG. Partial pressure of carbon dioxide increased with liberal oxygen administration in almost half of the patients, but no predictive factor was identified.www.clinicaltrials.gov (); registered 25 September, 2016.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670177>Maternal sociodemographic and health behaviours associated with adiposity in infants as measured by air displacement plethysmography.</a></h1><p>Identifying modifiable factors associated with body fat in infancy may improve health outcomes.

Mean percentage body fat among infants (51.% female) was 10.3 ± 3.7. Percentage body fat was significantly (p < 0.001) higher in infants born to women with an obese or overweight body mass index (BMI), when compared to infants born to women with a healthy BMI (12.1 ± 4.0, 11.1 ± 3.1, and 9.2 ± 3.7, respectively). A significant positive correlation (r = 0.294) was observed, with the percentage body fat of infants born to women with an overweight or obese BMI being 17.1% and 23.9% higher, respectively, than that of infants born to women with a healthy weight BMI. Percentage body fat was lower in infants born to primiparous women (p = 0.011) and women of low social class (p = 0.003).Infants born to women with an overweight or obese pre-pregnancy BMI had significantly higher mean percentage body fat when compared to infants born to women with a healthy pre-pregnancy BMI.

Similar experiments were also performed with leptin-deficient (Ob/Ob) mice.The results showed that the HFD group presented decreased GLUT2, PEPT1, FAT/CD36 and NPC1L1, and increased NHE3, MTTP and L-FABP content. Animals fed an HFD also presented enhanced lipid transporter gene expression of , , ,  and . Additionally, FAT/CD36 and NPC1L1 protein levels were reduced in both HFD-induced obese and Ob/Ob mice. Ob/Ob mice also exhibited increased  and  mRNAs expression, but the protein expression levels remained unchanged. The HFD also attenuated PKA and PKC activities. The inhibition of PKA was associated with decreased FAT/CD36 content, whereas increased L-FABP levels likely depend on CREB activation, independent of PKA. It is plausible that the HFD-induced changes in NPC1L1, MTTP and L-FABP protein content involve regulation at the level of transcription. Moreover, the changes in GLUT2 and PEPT1 content might be associated with low PKC activity.The results indicated that an HFD is capable of reducing nutrient transporter content, possibly attenuating nutrient uptake into the intestine, and may represent a feedback mechanism for regulating body weight. Furthermore, the elevated levels of NHE3, L-FABP and MTTP may account for the increased prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia in obese individuals. All of these changes are potentially linked to reduced PKA or PKC activities.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658604>The Importance of Self-Monitoring for Behavior Change in Youth: Findings from the SWITCH School Wellness Feasibility Study.</a></h1><p>School Wellness Integration Targeting Child Health (SWITCH) is a school wellness implementation initiative focused on building capacity for schools to plan and coordinate wellness programming. Grounded in Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), the purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of the web-based, self-regulation system on physical activity (PA) behavior outcomes. At pre-test and post-test, students in SWITCH schools ( = 8) completed the online Youth Activity Profile (YAP) to assess PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Students ( = 513) were categorized into high or low self-monitoring groups (using a median split) based on their use of the web-based self-regulation platform. Linear mixed models were used to assess differences in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and sedentary behavior, with school, classroom, student, time-by-school, and time-by-classroom random effects and main and interaction fixed effects for student self-monitoring, gender, and time. Significant self-monitoring-by-time interactions were observed for estimates of PA F(1, 477) = .55,  = 0.02 and SB F(1, 477) = 4.90,  = 0.03. Students in the high self-monitoring group had larger gains in PA per day and larger declines in hours per day of sedentary screen time behavior compared to students in the low self-monitoring group. These findings support the utility of web-based self-regulation for facilitating PA change in youth.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672576>Performance of a selective screening strategy for diagnosis of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy as defined by IADPSG/WHO criteria.</a></h1><p>Our study evaluated the performance of a selective screening strategy for hyperglycaemia in pregnancy (HIP) based on the presence of risk factors (RFs; body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m², age ≥ 35 years, family history of diabetes, personal history of HIP or macrosomia) to diagnose HIP and to predict HIP-related events.Women with no known diabetes who had undergone complete universal screening (early, before 22 weeks of gestation or, if not, in the second part of pregnancy) at our department (2012-2016) were selected, resulting in four groups of women according to the presence of HIP and/or RFs, with a predefined composite endpoint (preeclampsia or large-for-gestational-age infant or shoulder dystocia).Included were 4518 women: 23.% had HIP and 71.1% had at least one RF. The distribution among our four groups was: HIP-/RF- (n = 1144); HIP-/RF+ (n = 2313); HIP+/RF- (n = 163); and HIP+/RF+ (n = 898). HIP was more frequent when RFs were present rather than absent (33.1% vs 15.4%, respectively; P < 0.001). Incidence of the composite endpoint differed significantly (P < 0.0001) across groups [HIP-/RF- 6.3%; HIP-/RF+ 13.2%; HIP+/RF- 8.6%; and HIP+/RF+ 17.1% (HIP effect: P < 0.05; RF effect: P < 0.001; interaction HIP * RF: P = 0.94)] and significantly increased with the number of RFs (no RF: 6.3%, 1 RF: 10.8%, 2 RFs: 14.7%, 3 RFs: 28.0%, 4- RFs: 25.0%; P < 0.0001).RFs are predictive of HIP, although 15.4% of women with HIP have no RFs. Also, irrespective of HIP status, RFs are predictive of HIP-related events, suggesting that overweight/, the only modifiable RFs, could be targets of interventions to improve pregnancy prognosis.Copyright © 2019.

Using qualitative methods to augment understanding of intervention success may be one way to gain insight into the types of behavior change strategies that are most effective in childhood  interventions.COACH was a randomized controlled trial of 117 Latino parent-child (ages 3-) pairs in Nashville, TN that resulted in improved child BMI in intervention vs. control families at 1-year follow-up. All participant parents were invited to focus groups after the trial. Discussions were audiotaped, transcribed, and translated into English. A hierarchical coding scheme was generated, and qualitative analysis done using an inductive/deductive approach. Both theme saturation and consensus between the coders were achieved. Responses were compared between intervention and control groups.We conducted seven focus groups with 43 participants. 4 themes emerged from the intervention group: 1) perceived barriers to health behavior change; 2) strategies learned to overcome perceived barriers; 3) behavioral changes made in response to the program; and 4) knowledge, skills, and agency for family health behaviors. 4 themes emerged from the control group: 1) a desire to engage in health behaviors without specific strategies; 2) common set of barriers to health behavior change; 3) engagement in literacy activities, including creative problem-solving strategies; and 4) changes made in response to study visits. Analysis of coded data showed the intervention increased healthy behaviors (e.g., fruit/vegetable consumption) despite barriers (e.g., time, cost, culture, family dynamics). Intervention participants described using specific behavior change strategies promoted by the intervention including: substituting ingredients in culturally-normative recipes; avoiding grocery shopping when hungry; and coping with inability to meet goals with acceptance and problem-solving. Control participants reported little success in achieving healthy changes for their family. Intervention participants described successful health behavior changes that were shared across generations and were maintained after the program. Intervention participants reported increased awareness of their own agency in promoting their health.Qualitative evaluation of COACH provides a more detailed understanding of the intervention's quantitative effectiveness: child and adult health behaviors and personal agency were improved.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657456>Predictors of postoperative overall and severe complications after surgical treatment for endometrial cancer: The role of the fragility index.</a></h1><p>To evaluate the predictive value of , comorbidities, and fragility on overall and severe complication rate and survival among patients surgically treated for endometrial cancer.Consecutive patients with endometrial cancer treated at the Royal Infirmary Hospital of Edinburgh from June 1, 2015, to June 30, 2017, were retrospectively enrolled in an observational study. Considering pre-existing medical conditions, comorbidities, and complications, modified fragility index (mFI) was calculated. Logistic regression was used to evaluate predicting variables of overall (G1-G4) and severe (G3-G4) complication rate.One hundred patients were surgically treated for endometrial cancer. Elevated mFI >3 was related to a statistically higher access rate to the high dependency unit (HDU) or intensive care unit (ITU) (33.3% vs 6.6%, P=0.013). Overall, 31% of women had postoperative complications. Using multivariate analysis, it was shown that undergoing laparotomy (odds ratio [OR] 7.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.52-19.71; P<0.001) and having an mFI >3 (OR 7.19, 95% CI 1.43-36.25; P=0.021) were independent predictors of overall complications (G1-G4).

How long-term dietary BCAAs impact late-life health and lifespan is unknown. Here, we show that when dietary BCAAs are varied against a fixed, isocaloric macronutrient background, long-term exposure to high BCAA diets leads to hyperphagia,  and reduced lifespan. These effects are not due to elevated BCAA  or hepatic mTOR activation, but rather due to a shift in the relative quantity of dietary BCAAs and other AAs, notably tryptophan and threonine. Increasing the ratio of BCAAs to these AAs resulted in hyperphagia and is associated with central serotonin depletion. Preventing hyperphagia by calorie restriction or pair-feeding averts the health costs of a high BCAA diet. Our data highlight a role for amino acid quality in energy balance and show that health costs of chronic high BCAA intakes need not be due to intrinsic toxicity but, rather, a consequence of hyperphagia driven by AA imbalance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675146>The challenge of keeping it off, a descriptive systematic review of high-quality, follow-up studies of  treatments.</a></h1><p>The aim of this systematic review is to answer the question: Is substantial, stable, and long-term weight loss a viable goal for adults with ?

However, one consequence of massive weight loss is excess skin and soft tissue. Many details regarding the timing, outcomes, and barriers associated with body contouring surgery (BCS) in youth who have undergone bariatric surgery are unknown.Describe the incidence and effect of BCS following bariatric surgery among adolescents.University Hospitals METHODS: Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery is a prospective multi-institutional study of 242 adolescents who underwent bariatric surgery from 2007 to 2012. Utilization of BCS was analyzed in this population with comparison of anthropometrics and excess skin-related symptoms between those who did and those who did not undergo BCS.Among the 198 study participants with BCS data available, 25 (12.6%) underwent 41 body contouring procedures after bariatric surgery. The most common BCS was panniculectomy (n = 23). Presence of pannus-related symptoms at baseline and the magnitude of weight loss within the first year after bariatric surgery were independently associated with subsequent panniculectomy (P = .04 and P = .03, respectively). All adolescents who underwent panniculectomy experienced resolution of pannus-related symptoms. At  years after bariatric surgery, 74% of those who did not undergo panniculectomy reported an interest in the procedure, and 58% indicated that cost/insurance coverage was the barrier to obtaining BCS.Few adolescents who underwent bariatric surgery later underwent BCS procedures. Panniculectomy effectively treated pannus-related symptoms. Disparities in access to surgical care for adolescents who desire BCS warrants further investigation.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Bariatric Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, there was an increase of incidence of iron (9.2% to 18.%), vitamin B12 (4.2% to 11.1%) and magnesium deficiency (14.1% to 14.8%). Folic acid concentrations increased and the percentage of individuals with glucose (40.4% to 3.7%), triglycerides (38% to 7.4%), HDL cholesterol (31 % to 7.4%) and uric acid (70.% to 11.1%) abnormalities reduced. Also, there is a reduction of food intake at first year postoperative. After 10 years, there was an increase in energy, protein and lipid intake, also a reduction in folid acid intake.: Roux-en Y gastric bypass is an effective procedure to promote weight loss and improve comorbidities associated with .

The aim of this study was to propose an Extended CIAF (ECIAF) that combines the characterization of malnutrition due to undernutrition and excess weight, and apply it in six Argentine provinces.ECIAF excludes children not in anthropometric failure (group A) and was calculated from a percentage of children included in malnutrition categories B: wasting only; C: wasting and underweight; D: wasting, stunting and underweight; E: stunting and underweight; F: stunting only; Y: underweight only; G: only weight excess; and H: stunting and weight excess.Cross-sectional study conducted in Buenos Aires, Catamarca, Chubut, Jujuy, Mendoza and Misiones (Argentina).10 879 children of both sexes aged between 3 and 13·99.ECIAF in preschool children (3 to 4·99 years) was 15·1 %. The highest prevalence was registered in Mendoza (16·7 %) and the lowest in Misiones (12·0 %). In school children ( to 13·99 years) ECIAF was 28·6 %. Mendoza also recorded the highest rate (30·7 %), while Catamarca and Chubut had the lowest values (27·0 %). In the whole sample, about 25 % of the malnutrition was caused by undernutrition and 75 % by excess weight.The ECIAF summarizes anthropometric failure by both deficiency and excess weight and it highlights that a quarter of the malnutrition in the Argentine population was caused by undernutrition, although there are differences between Provinces (P < 0·05). ECIAF estimates are higher than those of CIAF or under-nutrition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642000>Metabolic syndrome is a predictor of decreased renal function among community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly Japanese.</a></h1><p>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is increasing worldwide with the continuous increase in  prevalence. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also a major public health problem, but there is controversy over whether baseline MetS is a predictor of decreased renal function among Japanese community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly Japanese.We conducted a prospective cohort study designed as part of the Nomura study. We recruited a random sample of 410 men aged 68 ± 8 (mean ± standard deviation; range, 50-95) years and 549 women aged 69 ± 7 (50-84) years during their annual health examination in a single community. We examined the relationship between baseline MetS and renal dysfunction after a 3-year evaluation based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the CKD-EPI equations modified by the Japan coefficient. CKD was defined as dipstick-positive proteinuria (> or = 1 +) or a low eGFR (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m).Of the 959 participants, 413 (43.1%) had MetS at baseline. Annual eGFR decline rate was significantly greater in those with MetS than in those without MetS, and the annual eGFR decline rate of < - 1.2 mL/min/1.73 m/year increased significantly in relation to presence of baseline MetS, especially low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C). Moreover, the incidence rate of CKD after 3 years was 13.% and increased significantly in relation to presence of baseline MetS, especially its components such as elevated HbA1c. The multivariate-adjusted odd ratio (OR) for CKD in participants with MetS versus those without MetS was 1.55 (0.99-2.43). The multivariate-adjusted ORs for rapid annual eGFR decline rate were significantly high in patients aged ≥ 65 years and presence of medication, regardless of gender and eGFR value.Low HDL-C and elevated HbA1c levels correlated significantly with eGFR decline in a short period of 3 years. MetS also showed a significant association with eGFR decline. This study suggests the importance of low HDL-C and elevated HbA1c in the effect of MetS on eGFR decline rather than  among Japanese community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly Japanese without CKD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642983>Associations of sugar intake with anthropometrics in children from ages 2 until 8 years in the EU Childhood  Project.</a></h1><p>We determined the association of total sugar intake with body weight and fat mass in children on an energy-equivalent basis and potential changes in the association from 2 to 8 years of age.Data were available from the Childhood  Project Trial initiated in 2002. Sugar intake was measured by 3-day weighed food protocols at 2, 3, 4, , 6, and 8 years of age. Body mass index (BMI) and fat mass index (FMI) were available at the same time points. To investigate the association of sugar intake with anthropometrics over time, linear mixed models were applied. Odds ratios for having a high BMI or FMI (above one standard deviation) were estimated by logistic random-effects models. To control for total energy intake, the residual method was chosen and models were additionally adjusted for total energy intake.Data were available for 809 children with in total 2846 observations. In an isocaloric model, an increase of 100 kcal from sugar per day was significantly associated with lower zBMI (- 0.033; 95% CI -0.061, - 0.005) and zFMI (- 0.050; 95% CI - 0.089, - 0.011). In addition, a 100 kcal higher sugar intake was related to lower odds of having a high zBMI (OR 0.743; 95% CI 0.611, 0.903).This study provides no indication that increased total sugar intake positively affects BMI on an energy-equivalent basis. Whether the negative association of sugar is due to physiological effects or points more to macronutrient preferences or a reporting bias (lower sugar intake) in children with higher BMI can be debated.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00338689; Registered: June 19, 2006.

Therefore, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to discern the effectiveness of a home-based educational exergaming intervention on preschoolers' energy expenditure, fitness, body mass index, and cognition.Participants were 32 preschoolers (16 girls; 59.4% Asian; M = 4.72, SD = ±0.73) recruited from the Twin Cities area in Minnesota. During baseline testing, we measured preschooler's daily energy expenditure (EE), cardiovascular fitness, body mass index, and cognitive flexibility using validated instruments. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (1) the exergaming intervention condition; or (2) control condition. The intervention program requested children participate in home-based educational exergaming using the LeapTV gaming console for at least 30 min/session  times/week. The control condition asked children to maintain regular PA patterns without any exergaming gameplay. Each condition lasted 12 weeks. We conducted identical outcome assessments for all children at baseline and post-intervention.Analysis of covariance with repeated measures yielded significant time x group interaction effects for cognitive flexibility, Wilks' Lambda = 0.81, (1, 29) = 6.98,  = 0.01,  = 0.19, suggesting children in the exergaming group demonstrated significantly greater increases in cognitive flexibility as compared to those in the control group over time. There were no significant differences for time x group changes between the two groups for EE, Wilks' Lambda = 0.92, (1, 29) = 2.29,  = 0.14,  = 0.08; cardiovascular fitness, Wilks' Lambda = 0.96, (1, 29) = 1.07,  = 0.31,  = 0.04; and BMI, Wilks' Lambda = 0.99, (1, 29) = 0.05,  = 0.82,  = 0.01. However, our data did suggest a marginal effect of time for EE, Wilks' Lambda = 0.89, (1, 29) = 3.26,  = 0.08,  = 0.08, indicating that children's daily EE increased from baseline to post-intervention.Home-based educational exergaming may positively impact cognitive flexibility in preschoolers. Studies with larger sample sizes in multiple geographic locations are needed, with our study suggesting a longer intervention period might also be warranted.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665455>GLP-1 Analog Modulates Appetite, Taste Preference, Gut Hormones and Regional Body Fat Stores in Adults with .</a></h1><p> is associated with alterations in appetite, gastrointestinal (GI) hormone levels and excessive fat mass. We previously published a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 16-week trial on effects of once daily GLP-1 analog, liraglutide on weight, satiation, and gastric functions in obese volunteers. The aim of this sub-study was to compare to placebo the effects of liraglutide on appetite, taste preference, regional body fat stores and anthropometric measurements.Forty obese adults received standard instruction for weight management, monthly behavioral intervention utilizing motivational interviews, and 16-week treatment of once daily liraglutide (escalated to 3mg SQ daily). At baseline and 16 weeks, the following were measured: appetite and taste preferences rated every 30 minutes for  hours after ingesting 300mL Ensure®; maximal tolerated volume (MTV) with a nutrient drink test; fasting and postprandial bioactive GLP-1 (7-36) and PYY levels; total and regional body fat with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and waist and hip circumference.Thirty-five participants (17 liraglutide; 18 placebo) completed the trial. Compared to placebo group, liraglutide group had significant reductions in MTV, prospective food consumption score, desire to eat something sweet, salty, savory or fatty, and an increase in perceived fullness. Postprandial plasma levels of GLP-1 decreased and PYY levels increased with liraglutide relative to baseline.

We have recently shown that Group Ia muscle spindle afferents, the sensory arm of the muscle stretch reflex, are less responsive in mice fed a high-fat diet. Here we test the hypothesis that reflex excitability to sensory information from Group Ia muscle spindle afferents is altered in a mouse model of diet-induced . We measured the anesthetized Hoffmann's or H-reflex, the electrical analog of the muscle stretch reflex. Adult mice of both sexes were fed a control diet (CD; 10% kcal from fat) or a high-fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal from fat) for , 10, or 15 weeks. We used three quantitative measures of H-reflex excitability: (1) H-reflex latency; (2) the percentage of motor neurons recruited from electrical stimulation of Group Ia muscle spindle afferents (H /M ); and (3) rate-dependent depression (RDD), the decrease in H-reflex amplitude to high frequency stimulation (20 stimuli at  Hz). A HFD did not significantly alter H latency (P = 0.16) or H /M ratios (P = 0.06), but RDD was significantly lower in HFD compared to CD groups (P < 0.001). Interestingly, HFD males exhibited decreased RDD compared to controls only after  and 10 weeks of feeding, but females showed progressive decreases in RDD that were only significant at 10 and 15 weeks on the HFD. These results suggest that high-fat feeding increases H-reflex excitability.

This prospective study quantifies vancomycin pharmacokinetics in morbidly obese and non-obese individuals, in order to guide vancomycin dosing in the obese.Morbidly obese individuals (n=20) undergoing bariatric surgery and non-obese healthy volunteers (n=8) (total body weight (TBW) 60.0-234.6 kg) received a single vancomycin dose (obese: 12. mg kg , maximum 2500 mg; non-obese: 1000 mg) with plasma concentrations measured over 48 hours (11-13 samples per individual). Modelling, internal validation, external validation using previously published data and simulations (n=9950 individuals, TBW 60-230 kg) were performed using NONMEM.In a three-compartment model, peripheral volume and clearance increased with TBW (both p<0.001), which was confirmed in the external validation. A dose of 35 mg kg per day (maximum 5500 mg/day) resulted in a >90% target attainment (AUC>400 mg*h L ) in individuals up to 200 kg, with corresponding trough concentrations of .7-14.6 mg L (twice daily dosing). For continuous infusion, a loading dose of 1500 mg is required for steady state on day 1.In this prospective, rich sampling pharmacokinetic study, vancomycin clearance was well predicted using TBW. We recommend that in obese individuals without renal impairment, vancomycin should be dosed as 35 mg kg per day (maximized at 5500 mg/day). When given over two daily doses, trough concentrations between .7-14.6 mg L correspond to the target exposure in obese individuals.This article is protected by copyright.

Mean half-body volumes relative to the whole-body values were 50.8% (48.2-53.7%) for ASAT and 49.2% (46.3-51.8%) for ASAT. Corresponding volume fractions were 56.4% (51.4-65.9%) for VAT and 43.6% (34.1-48.6%) for VAT. Correlations of ASAT with ASAT as well as with ASAT were both excellent (R > 0.99, p < 0.01). Corresponding correlations of VAT were marginally lower (R = 0.98 for VAT, p < 0.01, and R = 0.97 for VAT, p < 0.01).In conclusion, abdominal fat volumes can be reliably assessed by half-body MRI data, in particular the subcutaneous fat compartment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651309>A predictive model for non-completion of an intensive specialist  service in a public hospital: a case-control study.</a></h1><p>Despite the growing evidence base supporting intensive lifestyle and medical treatments for severe , patient engagement in specialist  services is difficult to achieve and poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we aimed to develop a model for predicting non-completion of a specialist multidisciplinary service for clinically severe , termed the Metabolic Rehabilitation Programme (MRP).Using a case-control study design in a public hospital setting, we extracted data from medical records for all eligible patients with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥35 kg/m with either type 2 diabetes or fatty liver disease referred to the MRP from 2010 through 2015. Non-completion status (case definition) was coded for patients whom started but dropped-out of the MRP within 12 months. Using multivariable logistic regression, we tested the following baseline predictors hypothesised in previous research: age, gender, BMI, waist circumference, residential distance from the clinic, blood pressure, obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), current continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, current depression/anxiety, diabetes status, and medications. We used receiver operating characteristics and area under the curve to test the performance of models.Out of the 219 eligible patient records, 78 (35.6%) non-completion cases were identified. Significant differences between non-completers versus completers were: age (47.1 versus 54. years, p < 0.001); residential distance from the clinic (21.8 versus 17.1 km, p = 0.018); obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) (42.9% versus 56.7%, p = 0.050) and CPAP therapy (11.7% versus 28.4%, p = 0.005). The probability of non-completion could be independently associated with age, residential distance, and either OSA or CPAP. There was no statistically significant difference in performance between the alternate models (69.% versus 66.4%, p = 0.57).Non-completion of intensive specialist  management services is most common among younger patients, with fewer complex care needs, and those living further away from the clinic. Clinicians should be aware of these potential risk factors for dropping out early when managing outpatients with severe , whereas policy makers might consider strategies for increasing access to specialist  management services.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644670>CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF SURGICAL TREATMENT TECHNIQUES OF MORBID .</a></h1><p> is a disease of high prevalence in Brazil and in the world, and bariatric surgery, with its different techniques, is an alternative treatment.To compare techniques: adjustable gastric band (AGB), sleeve gastrectomy), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) analyzing leaks, bleeding, death, weight loss, resolution of type 2 diabetes, systemic arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia and obstructive sleep apnea.Were selected studies in the PubMed database from 2003 to 2014 using the descriptors:  surgery; bariatric surgery; biliopancreatic diversion; sleeve gastrectomy; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and adjustable gastric banding. Two hundred and forty-four articles were found with the search strategy of which there were selected 116 studies through the inclusion criteria.Excess weight loss (EWL) after five years in AGB was 48.35%; 52.7% in SG; 71.04% in RYGB and 77.90% in BPD. The postoperative mortality was 0.05% in the AGB; 0.16% on SG; 0.60% in RYGB and 2.52% in BPD. The occurrence of leak was 0.68% for GBA; 1.93% for SG; 2.18% for RYGB and .23% for BPD. The incidence of bleeding was 0.44% in AGB; 1.29% in SG; 0.81% in RYGB and 2.09% in BPD. The rate of DM2 resolved was 46.80% in AGB, 79.38% in SG, 79.86% in RYGB and 90.78% in BPD. The rate of dyslipidemia, apnea and hypertension resolved showed no statistical differences between the techniques.The AGB has the lowest morbidity and mortality and it is the worst in EWL and resolution of type 2 diabetes. The SG has low morbidity and mortality, good resolution of comorbidities and EWL lower than in RYGB and BPD. The RYGB has higher morbidity and mortality than AGB, good resolution of comorbidities and EWL similar to BPD.

We hypothesized that MetS confers an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in severely injured trauma patients.We performed a retrospective review of trauma patients from 2014 through 2018, excluding patients <16 years of age, ISS <16, and with incomplete height and/or weight documentation. MetS was defined as the presence of diabetes, hypertension, and a BMI ≥30 kg/m. Outcomes included length of stay (LOS), complications, discharge location, and mortality.There were 4,491 patients meeting criteria of which 100 (2.2%) had MetS. Patients with MetS were older (64.0 vs 38.6 years, p<.0001) but similar in ISS (22 vs 22, p=.70). Hospital LOS was significantly longer with MetS (16. vs 11 days, p <.0001) as was ICU LOS (9 vs  days, p=.0002). MetS correlated with higher rates of AKI (19% vs 3.6%,p<.0001), ARDS (11.0% vs 4.6%, p=.01), cardiac arrest (10.0% vs 4.0%, p=.01), MI (2.0% vs 0.3%, p=.05), severe sepsis (8.0% vs 3.3%, p=.03), unplanned intubation (11.0% vs .0%, p=.02), unplanned ICU admission (13.0% vs 6.1%, p=.02), and non-home discharge (51.0% vs 30.2%, p=.0007). After controlling for age, GCS, ISS, gender, and mechanism, MetS remained an independent predictor of mortality (OR 2., 95% CI 1.33-4.7, p=.004).MetS occurs infrequently in our severely injured trauma population but is strongly associated with increasing LOS as well as cardiac, pulmonary, infectious, and renal complications. MetS also significantly and independently predicts death and should be identified early to facilitate prompt multidisciplinary treatment.Copyright © 2019.

There is a relationship between the high activity of this enzyme and the development of  and metabolic disorders. The inhibition of 11β-HSD1 has been shown to attenuate the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and other diseases mediated by excessive cortisol production. In this work, fifteen benzothiazole derivatives substituted with electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups were designed to explore their affinity for 11β-HSD1 using in silico methods. The results show that (E)--((benzo[d]thiazol-2-ylimino)(methylthio)methylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (C1) has good physicochemical properties and favorable interactions with 11β-HSD1 through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions in the catalytic site formed by Y183, S170 and Y177. Furthermore, C1 was synthesized and evaluated in vitro and ex vivo using clobenzorex (CLX) as a reference drug in obese Zucker rats. The in vitro results showed that C1 was a better inhibitor of human 11β-HSD1 than CLX. The ex vivo assay results demonstrated that C1 was capable of reducing 11β-HSD1 overexpression in mesenteric adipose tissue.

We compared first exposure to interpersonal racism at either ages 4- years or 7 years with no exposure to examine the influence of sensitive periods of racism exposure on mental health and physiological outcomes during middle childhood (7-12 years). The study cohort comprised 1,759 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children aged 4-12 years from waves 2-8 (2009-2015) of the Footprints in Time: 1The Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children (LSIC) dataset. Multilevel logistic regression was used in all analysis. We observed a larger effect (OR: 2.8; 95% CI: 1.4-.4) for negative mental health with first exposure at 4- years compared to 7 years (OR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.2-3.6), referenced to children with no exposure. Effect sizes were similar in both exposure groups for the significantly increased risk of sleep difficulties, while a stronger adverse effect on behavioural issues was found at 7 years (OR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.3-4.0) relative to 4- years (OR: 1.7; 95% CI: 0.8-3.7). No significant associations were found with general health,  or being underweight. This study generates new evidence surrounding sensitive periods of exposure to racism in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. A pattern of consistently greater adverse effects on mental and physiological health was not observed with first exposure at 4- compared to 7 years, although initial evidence indicates that first exposure to racism at these ages increases the likelihood of negative mental health relative to children without racism exposure. Longitudinal data extending from earlier to later developmental periods will allow further investigations into the presence of sensitive periods of exposure to racism in these children.© 2019 The Authors.

Fifty-two young sedentary men with excess body weight (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg·m) were enrolled in a randomized-crossover controlled trial [six weeks of a systematic physical exercise with  or placebo supplementation (4. g·day)]. Body composition, blood lipid profile, and maximal oxygen uptake were determined pre/post intervention. Pairwise comparisons showed a significant improvement ( < 0.01) on blood lipid profile in the group of exercise plus . Moreover, correlations of absolute changes of BMI, body fat percentage, blood lipids and maximal oxygen uptake were statistically significant ( < 0.01). These results indicate that the  supplementation could be acting in a synergistic way with exercise due to the enhanced effects on body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, and blood lipid profile.

The Bill established the requirement of a 100% pass-through of the tax to the final consumer and two levels of the tax: 0.08 euro/liter for products with -less than 8 g of sugar and 0.12 euro/liter for products with 8 g of sugar or more. Previous literature focusing on the impact of SSB taxes finds that pass-though is only complete in the long-term. Our paper provides new evidence that, when the tax increases prices substantially and immediately, the sales response is also significant. In particular, we estimate that the new SSB tax in Catalonia reduced SSB purchases by 7.7%. We document that part of this reduction is substituted by an increase in sales of zero/light drinks (substitution effect). Importantly, the reduction in purchases is stronger in areas with a higher incidence of , in areas with higher household incomes and for products with higher sugar content.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Thiazolidinedione (TZD) antidiabetic drugs, which activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) nuclear receptor, are potent stimuli for adipocyte browning yet fail to induce  expression in mouse adipocytes. In contrast,  is one of the most strongly TZD-induced transcripts in human adipocytes, although not in cells from all individuals. Two putative PPARγ binding sites exist near the gene's transcription start site (TSS) in human but not mouse adipocytes. The -4 kb upstream site falls in a segmental duplication of a nearly identical intronic region +2. kb downstream of the TSS, and this duplication occurred in the primate lineage and not in other mammals, like mice. PPARγ binding and gene activation occur via this upstream duplicated site, thus explaining the species difference. Furthermore, this functional upstream PPARγ site exhibits genetic variation among people, with 1 SNP allele disrupting a PPAR response element and giving less activation by PPARγ and TZDs. In addition to this upstream variant that determines PPARγ regulation of  in adipocytes, distinct variants downstream of the TSS have strong effects on  expression in human fat as well as other tissues. A haplotype of 7 tightly linked downstream SNP alleles is associated with very low  expression and correspondingly high DNA methylation at the TSS.

Furthermore, the Fatty Acid Sensor (FAS) Study (n = 141; 27.7%  prevalence) was used as an independent sample to replicate the results.  The linear trend test demonstrated a significant association of PRS with  in the QFS discovery sample (OR = 1.19 [95% CI, 1.14-1.24]; P = 2.0x10). We also found that the  prevalence was significantly greater in the higher PRS quintiles compared to the lowest quintile. Significant and consistent results were obtained in the QFS validation sample for both the linear trend test (OR = 1.16 [95% CI, 1.07-1.26]; P = 6.7x10), and  prevalence across quintiles. These results were partially replicated in the FAS sample (OR = 1.12 [95% CI, 1.02-1.24]; P = 2.2x10). PRS explained 7.%, 3.2%, and 1.2% of BMI variance in QFS discovery, QFS validation, and FAS samples, respectively.  These results revealed that genetic background in the form of a 231 BMI-associated PRS has a significant impact on , but a limited potential to accurately stratify it.

To answer this question, we develop a method for computing similarities between empirical, statistical distributions of high-dimensional, low-sample datasets, and apply it on hundreds of -omics studies. The similarities lead to dataset-to-dataset networks visualizing the landscape of a large portion of biological data. Potentially interesting similarities connecting studies of different diseases are assembled in a disease-to-disease network. Exploring it, we discover numerous non-trivial connections between Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, asthma and psoriasis, or liver cancer and , to name a few. We then present a method that identifies the molecular quantities and pathways that contribute the most to the identified similarities and could point to novel drug targets or provide biological insights.

All three components can be measured generically by the basic systolic and diastolic dimension measures of LV wall length, wall thickness and diameter. In this observational study we aimed to study the relations of normal generic strains to age, body size and gender, as well as the interrelations between the three strain components.Generic strains derived from dimension measures by longitudinal and cross-sectional M-mode in all three dimensions were measured in 1266 individuals without heart disease from the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study.The mean ε was -16.3%, ε was -22.7% and ε was 56.%. Normal values by age and gender are provided. There was a gradient of ε from the endocardial, via the midwall to the external level, lowest at the external. All strains decreased in absolute values by increasing body surface area (BSA) and age, relations were strongest for ε. Gender differences were mainly a function of BSA differences. The three strain components were strongly interrelated through myocardial incompressibility.Global systolic strain is the total deformation of the myocardium; the three strain components are the spatial coordinates of this deformation, irrespective of the technology used for measurement. Normal values are method-dependent and not normative across methods. Interrelation of strains indicates a high degree of myocardial incompressibility and that longitudinal strain carries most of the total information.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has previously been shown to improve transplant eligibility through weight loss.We aimed to examine the role LSG plays in improving patient outcomes postrenal transplantation, including possible impact on new-onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT).University Hospital.A single-center analysis was performed identifying all patients who underwent KT after LSG from 2011 to 2017 (n = 41). Exclusion criteria included type I diabetes and previous pancreas transplantation. NODAT was defined as a new insulin requirement after KT. Delayed graft function was defined as need for dialysis within the first week after KT. Mean posttransplant follow-up period was 22 months.Forty-one patients underwent KT after LSG after median time of 16 months. Median age of postLSG patients undergoing KT was 56.0 years at time of KT. Average body mass index decreased by 9 from the time of LSG to KT, and no patients regained weight at 1-year follow-up. After LSG, the number of patients with hypertension (85.4% versus 48.%) and the number of antihypertensive medications used decreased significantly (1.6 versus .6) at time of KT (P < .001 each). At 1-year follow-up, the improvement in hypertension persisted (51.2% versus 48.%, P = nonsignificant). The average insulin regimen decreased from 33.0 ± 51.6 to 11.7 ± 21. units at KT (P < .001). This improvement also persisted at 1-year follow-up (11.9 versus 11.7 units, P = nonsignificant). Zero patients suffered NODAT over the follow-up period (versus institutional rate of NODAT at 15.8%). One patient developed delayed graft function (2.4%, versus institutional rate of 13.3%). After 1 year postKT, there was 1 graft loss (2.4%) and no mortality.This is the largest reported series of KT after planned LSG in morbidly obese patients. Our results confirm excellent posttransplant outcomes among patients who otherwise would have been denied KT eligibility.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Bariatric Surgery.

We investigated the predictive value of sex on associated symptoms and prevalent cardiovascular disease, after adjustment for relevant confounding factors including age, , and comorbidities.Most of the patients (90%) had OSA (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] ≥  events/h), and 66% were obese. Women were older than men and had a higher body mass index; however, men had a thicker neck circumference, a higher waist-to-hip ratio, and increased OSA severity (AHI 36 versus 27 events/h, P < .001). Female sex independently predicted prevalent CVD after adjustment for confounders (odds ratio [95% CI] 1.476 [1.154-1.887], P = .002). Men independently were more likely to report driving problems (3.359 [2.470-4.569], P < .001) and excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS ≥ 16) (1.355 [1.036-1.773], P = .027).

LP success can depend on the size and anatomy of the patient and the skill of the hematologist. The main objective was to determine the influence of body mass index (BMI) on LP outcomes.  Adults with lymphoid malignancies requiring LP were included prospectively over one year; hematology residents performed most procedures. A 22-gauge Quincke needle was employed. Comparison between non-traumatic vs. traumatic LPs according to BMI, CNS relapse, and residents' year was performed.  Fifty-four patients with a mean age of 31.±15.57 years were included. Diagnosis was Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia-B (74%), Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia-T (13%) and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (13%). 227 LPs were performed, 121 (53.3%) successful, 98 (43.2%) traumatic, 11 (11.2%) TLPs were macroscopically detectable and 87 (88%) microscopic; 8 (3.%) were dry-taps. Median time between punctures was 11 days (1-202). Median BMI was 25 (22.8-39.6). Main indication for LP was prophylactic (74.%); 39.2% were performed by first-year, 35.2% by second-year, 19.6% by third-year hematology residents. No difference (p = 0.145) for a TLP was found among residents. A BMI ≥30 (p = 0.040), non-palpable intervertebral space (p = 0.001) and more than one attempt (p = 0.001) were significant for TLP. TLP was not associated with CNS relapse (p = 0.962).   predicted a TLP.

Missing values (7.4%) were imputed using multiple imputation by chained equations. We used three-level logistic regression with the achievement of HbA , blood pressure and LDL cholesterol targets as dependent variables, and factors related to population, general practitioners, and practices as independent variables.Treatment targets were achieved for HbA in 64%, blood pressure in 50%, and LDL cholesterol in 52% of people with type 2 diabetes, and 17% met all three targets. There was substantial heterogeneity in target achievement among general practitioners and among practices; 80% of unadjusted predicted achievement was within 55-73% for HbA , 36-63% for blood pressure, and 47-57% for LDL cholesterol targets. The models explained 11%, % and 14%, respectively, of the total variation in the achievement of HbA , blood pressure and LDL cholesterol targets. Use among general practitioners of a structured diabetes form was associated with 23% higher odds of achieving the HbA target (odds ratio 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.47) and 17% higher odds of achieving the LDL cholesterol target (odds ratio 1.17, 95% CI 1.01-1.35).Clinical diabetes management is difficult, and few people meet all three risk factor control targets.

However, the availability of public social media data has led to new ethical challenges about respecting user privacy and the appropriateness of monitoring social media for clinical trial recruitment. Researchers have voiced the need for involving users' perspectives in the development of ethical norms and regulations.This study examined the attitudes and level of concern among Twitter users and nonusers about using Twitter for monitoring social media users and their conversations to recruit potential clinical trial participants.We used two online methods for recruiting study participants: the open survey was (1) advertised on Twitter between May 23 and June 8, 2017, and (2) deployed on TurkPrime, a crowdsourcing data acquisition platform, between May 23 and June 8, 2017. Eligible participants were adults, 18 years of age or older, who lived in the United States. People with and without Twitter accounts were included in the study.While nearly half the respondents-on Twitter (94/603, 15.6%) and on TurkPrime (509/603, 84.4%)-indicated agreement that social media monitoring constitutes a form of eavesdropping that invades their privacy, over one-third disagreed and nearly 1 in  had no opinion. A chi-square test revealed a positive relationship between respondents' general privacy concern and their average concern about Internet research (P<.005). We found associations between respondents' Twitter literacy and their concerns about the ability for researchers to monitor their Twitter activity for clinical trial recruitment (P=.001) and whether they consider Twitter monitoring for clinical trial recruitment as eavesdropping (P<.001) and an invasion of privacy (P=.003). As Twitter literacy increased, so did people's concerns about researchers monitoring Twitter activity. Our data support the previously suggested use of the nonexceptionalist methodology for assessing social media in research, insofar as social media-based recruitment does not need to be considered exceptional and, for most, it is considered preferable to traditional in-person interventions at physical clinics. The expressed attitudes were highly contextual, depending on factors such as the type of disease or health topic (eg, HIV/AIDS vs  vs smoking), the entity or person monitoring users on Twitter, and the monitored information.The data and findings from this study contribute to the critical dialogue with the public about the use of social media in clinical research. The findings suggest that most users do not think that monitoring Twitter for clinical trial recruitment constitutes inappropriate surveillance or a violation of privacy. However, researchers should remain mindful that some participants might find social media monitoring problematic when connected with certain conditions or health topics. Further research should isolate factors that influence the level of concern among social media users across platforms and populations and inform the development of more clear and consistent guidelines.©Katja Reuter, Yifan Zhu, Praveen Angyan, NamQuyen Le, Akil A Merchant, Michael Zimmer.

Existing treatments are only moderately effective with high relapse rates, necessitating novel interventions. This paper describes the rationale for, and protocol of, a feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT), evaluating the combination of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and a computerised cognitive training, namely approach bias modification training (ABM), in patients with BED who are overweight or obese. The aim of this trial is to obtain information that will guide decision-making and protocol development in relation to a future large-scale RCT of combined tDCS+ABM treatment in this group of patients, and also to assess the preliminary efficacy of this intervention.66 participants with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual- diagnosis of BED and a body mass index (BMI) of ≥25 kg/m will be randomly allocated to one of three groups: ABM+real tDCS; ABM+sham tDCS or a wait-list control group. Participants in both intervention groups will receive six sessions of ABM+real/sham tDCS over 3 weeks; engaging in the ABM task while simultaneously receiving bilateral tDCS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. ABM is based on an implicit learning paradigm in which participants are trained to enact an avoidance behaviour in response to visual food cues. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, post-treatment (3 weeks) and follow-up (7 weeks post-randomisation). Feasibility outcomes assess recruitment and retention rates, acceptability of random allocation, blinding success (allocation concealment), completion of treatment sessions and research assessments. Other outcomes include eating disorder psychopathology and related neurocognitive outcomes (ie, delay of gratification and inhibitory control), BMI, other psychopathology (ie, mood), approach bias towards food and surrogate endpoints (ie, food cue reactivity, trait food craving and food intake).This study has been approved by the North West-Liverpool East Research Ethics Committee.

Previous studies have reported the extracts from bark, seed, fruits, peels, leaves, and stems of  mangostana and  that were used to treat adipogenesis, inflammation, , cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. Moreover, the hypoglycemic effects and underlined actions of different species such as G. kola, G. pedunculata, and G. prainiana have been elucidated. However, the anti-hyperglycemia of  remains to be verified in this aspect. In this article, the published literature was collected and reviewed based on the medicinal characteristics of the species Garcinia, particularly in diabetic care to deliberate the known constituents from Garcinia and further focus on and isolate new compounds of  (Taiwan distinctive species) on various hypoglycemic targets including α-amylase, α-glucosidase, '-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), insulin receptor kinase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) via the molecular docking approach with Gold program to explore the potential candidates for anti-diabetic treatments. Accordingly, benzopyrans and triterpenes are postulated to be the active components in  for mediating blood glucose. To further validate the potency of those active components, in vitro enzymatic and cellular function assays with in vivo animal efficacy experiments need to be performed in the near future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651289>Weight management among school-aged children and adolescents: a quantitative assessment in a Ghanaian municipality.</a></h1><p>Childhood and adolescent overweight,  and underweight have become an issue of grave concern to both the developed and developing countries in context of global burden of non-communicable diseases. Unhealthy weight status is a significant public health issue for developing countries, of which Ghana is not excluded. This study evaluated the prevalence of overweight,  and underweight and its related factors among school-aged children and adolescents.A total of 1004 participants were randomly selected from six schools. A structured questionnaire on demography and socioeconomic status of students' parents/guardians was completed by the selected students. Anthropometric parameters were measured, and body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) were calculated. BMI-for-age z-scores were used to categorize anthropometric data of the children as underweight, normal, overweight or obese. A cut-off value of > 0.50 was used to define  by WHtR.Overweight prevalence of 13.8% and 12.6 was observed among basic school and high school students respectively based on BMI classification.  prevalence of 8.8% was found in basic school students and 8.9% among high school students. Underweight was observed in 114 (11.3%) basic school students and 86 (8.6%) high school students. There was a difference in sex prevalence in unhealthy weight-behaviours; with more girls being overweight (19.4% vs 7.6%, p < 0.001) and obese (10.2% vs. 7.3%, p = 0.177) compared to boys. High WHtR found in 10.% of basic students and .0% of high school students, with a statistical difference. Overweight/ was significantly associated with taking snacks before bed among basic school students [aOR = 10.45(.95-18)] and high school students [aOR = 10.23(.95-18.37)] respectively. Watching TV [aOR = 0.39(0.22-0.70)], sleeping during leisure periods [aOR = 0.43(0.23-0.81)] and bicycling as a means of transport [aOR = 0.37(0.19-0.72)] to school was protective of  among basic school students.High prevalence of unhealthy weight-related behaviours was observed among school-aged children in the Bekwai Municipality. Snacking before bed was a major factor promoting  among school-aged children while leisure behaviours such as TV watching, and sleeping were protective of . Therefore, it is recommended to promote and support healthy eating habits among school-aged children which are likely beneficial in reducing the risk of childhood unhealthy weight-related behaviours.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657983>Correlation between Dental Maturity and Body Mass Index in Korean Children.</a></h1><p>: The aim of this study was to determine relationships between dental maturity and body mass index (BMI) in Korean children. : 600 Korean children aged between  and 10 years for whom panoramic radiographs have been obtained between 2010 and 2017 were selected. Subjects were divided into four weight-status groups: underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese. Five lower-left permanent teeth were observed and rated. The stage of each tooth was converted into a score using the table suggested by Demirjian, and the sum of these scores was designated as the 'maturity score'. : This study found statistically significant differences in dental maturity between the weight groups (analysis of variance, P=0.003), with the maturity score being higher in the obese group than in normal-weight subjects (Tukey's post-hoc test, P=0.004). The linear regression showed a positive association between BMI and the maturity score after adjusting for sex and age (β=0.34, P<0.001). The linear regression coefficient was higher in girls (β=0.61, P<0.001) than in boys (β=0.31, P=0.02). : These data suggest that dental maturation is positively associated with BMI in Korean children. Since many treatment decisions are made in relation to dental maturity, these findings may have implications for pediatric dental care.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665931>Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and nutritional status are clinically useful in predicting prognosis in colorectal cancer patients.</a></h1><p>: Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and nutritional status may provide a prognostic value in colorectal cancer (CRC).

We excluded those women with pre-existing type 2 diabetes, those with missing data, and those with unlikely data. GDM was defined as fasting glucose levels >.55 mmol/L [>100 mg/dL] or >7.77 mmol/L [>140 mg/dL] two hours after glucose load in the oral glucose tolerance test. Potential predictors were selected based on prior research and ease of evaluation.From the original database of 100 758 records, 86 362 women were included in the final cohort. The mean GDM prevalence was 7.6% (95%CI [confidence interval] 7.%-7.8%), increasing from 4.4% (95% CI 4.0%-4.9%) in 2002 to 13.0% (95% CI 12.0%-13.9%) in 2015. Age, education, marital status, parity, family history of type 2 diabetes, personal history of GDM, hypertension and pre-eclampsia, alcohol consumption, smoking, and pre-gestational nutritional status performed well in the prediction of GDM.One out of eight Chilean pregnant women of medium- to low socio-economic status were found to develop GDM. We identified a set of easy-to-capture predictors in the primary health care system that may allow for the early identification of women at high risk for the development of GDM.© 2019 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656490>An audit of surgical site infection following open prostatectomy in a Nigerian Teaching Hospital.</a></h1><p>Surgical site infections (SSI) are a potential cause of morbidity and increased cost of care after operations such as open prostatectomy.To audit the occurrence of SSI after open prostatectomy at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex (OAUTHC), Ile-Ife, Nigeria.A review of all patients who underwent open prostatectomy over a ten-year period (July 2005 to June 2015). Data analysis was done using the statistical package for social sciences version 21. Association between variables was determined using Chi-square or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.A total of 247 open prostatectomy surgeries were reviewed, with the patients' ages ranging from 43 - 91 years and a mean age of 67.0 ± 8.8 years. Elective procedures were 98.8% while the remaining 1.2% were emergency cases. There were 24 (9.8%) surgical site infections. The duration of admission of the patients with SSI ranged from 6 - 15 days with a mean of 9. ± 3.2 days, as against 4 - 9 days (mean of .0 ± 2.1days) for those without SSI. All the patients with SSI were successfully managed with no resultant mortality. Risk factors identified for SSI were emergency surgery (p=0.001),  (p<0.0001), diabetes mellitus (p=0.008), smoking (p<0.0001), pre-operative catheterization (p<0.0001), excessive haemorrhage (p<0.0001) and post-operative suprapubic bladder drainage (p<0.0001).SSI is a recognized complication of open prostatectomy.

This study evaluated whether alterations in skin microcirculation were already present in obese adolescents in a pre-clinical phase of cardiovascular disease.After an overnight fasting 22 obese adolescents and 24 normal-weight controls of similar age and gender distribution underwent clinical and blood examination and assessment of microvascular function by using two non-invasive techniques such as Peripheral Artery Tonometry (PAT) and Laser-Doppler Flowmetry (LDF). As compared to normal weight subjects, obese children had higher blood pressure, were significantly more hyper-insulinemic and insulin resistant, showing significantly higher plasma total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). LDF showed lower pre- and post-occlusion forearm skin perfusion (perfusion units/second (PU/sec); median [IQR]) in obese than in normal weight subjects (pre-occlusion: 1633.8 [1023.] vs. 2281.1 [1344.2]; p = 0.015. Post-occlusion: 4811.3 [4068.9] vs. 7072.8 [7298.8]; p = 0.021), while PAT revealed similar values of reactive hyperemia index (RHI). In entire population, fat mass % (FM%) was an independent determinant of both pre-and post-occlusion skin perfusion. Finally, being obese was associated with a higher risk to have a reduction of both pre- and post-occlusion skin perfusion (OR = ,82 and 9,27, respectively).LDF showed very early, pre-clinical, vascular involvement in obese adolescents, characterized by impaired skin microcirculation, possibly reflecting a more diffuse microvascular dysfunction to other body tissues. Whether changing life style and improving weight may reverse such pre-clinical alterations remains to be established.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Details of demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and cutaneous markers were collected for both the groups.Prevalence of hypertension (30.3 vs. 13.6%),  (28.8 vs. 12.2%), hair thinning (36.3 vs. 14.6%), premature graying (49.6 vs. 29.9%), AGA (49.1 vs. 27.4%), and lipid abnormalities (total cholesterol - 16.7 vs. 8.8%; low-density lipoprotein - 7.3 vs. 2.2%; and high-density lipoprotein - 92. vs. 88.7%) were higher in cases as compared with control. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that AGA [.619, 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.025-7.845, <0.0001] is the strongest predictor of CAD among young Asian male individuals, closely followed by premature graying (.267, 95% CI: 3.716-7.466, <0.0001),  (4.133, 95% CI: 2.839-6.018, <0.0001), and hair thinning (3.36, 95% CI: 2.452-4.621, <0.0001). SYNTAX score, left ventricle ejection fraction, and degree of disease severity were also found to be independent associates of premature graying and AGA.Our findings support the hypothesis that cutaneous markers are independently associated with underlying CAD irrespective of other classical cardiovascular risk factors. This, in combination with classical markers, could be effectively used for early identification and risk stratification of young patients with occult or established CAD.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Gastrointestinal hormones are involved in energy and glucose homeostasis, thus postoperative changes of their circulating levels may be mediating future weight loss. To investigate how the circulating concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones change in response to the most common types of bariatric operation and whether these changes can predict future weight loss.We measured circulating GLP-1, GLP-2, oxyntomodulin, glicentin, glucagon, major proglucagon fragment (MPGF), ghrelin, GIP, PYY after overnight fasting and/or after a mixed meal test (MMT) in: a) 14 subjects that have undergone either an adjustable gastric banding [AGB] (n = 9) or a Roux-en-Y bypass (RYGB) (n = ) (Pilot study 1), b) 28 subjects that have undergone either a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (n = 17) or a RYGB (n = 11) before and three, six and twelve months after surgery.In addition to the expected associations with GLP-1, the most robust increases were observed in postprandial levels of oxyntomodulin and glicentin three months after VSG or RYGB (but not after AGB) and are associated with degree of weight loss. Oxyntomodulin and glicentin levels at the third and sixth month postoperative visit are positively associated with feeling of satiety which may be underlying the observed associations with future weight loss.Beyond GLP-1, early postprandial changes in circulating oxyntomodulin and glicentin are predictors of weight loss after bariatric surgery, possibly through regulation of satiety.

Findings indicate sports sponsorship is widely used to promote unhealthy foods through professional and community sport, prompting increased awareness and preference for sponsor products. Most studies assessed self-reported responses to sponsorship, with a lack of behavioural data on food purchasing and consumption. Sports sponsorship by unhealthy food brands achieves vast population reach and exposure, promoting increased brand awareness and preference for sponsor products.

Identification of novel target genes and mechanisms that regulate adipocyte function could lead to improved treatment strategies. RND3 (RhoE/Rho8), a Rho-related GTP-binding protein that inhibits Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling, has been linked to diverse diseases such as apoptotic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cancer and type 2 diabetes, in part by regulating cytoskeleton dynamics and insulin-mediated glucose uptake.We here investigated the expression of RND3 in adipose tissue in human , and discovered a role for RND3 in regulating adipocyte metabolism. In cross-sectional and prospective studies, we observed -fold increased adipocyte levels of RND3 mRNA in , reduced levels after surgery-induced weight loss, and positive correlations of RND3 mRNA with adipocyte size and surrogate measures of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR and circulating triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TAG/HDL-C) ratio). By screening for RND3-dependent gene expression following siRNA-mediated RND3 knockdown in differentiating human adipocytes, we found downregulation of inflammatory genes and upregulation of genes related to adipocyte ipolysis and insulin signaling. Treatment of adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hypoxia or cAMP analogs increased RND3 mRNA levels 1.-2-fold. Functional assays in primary human adipocytes confirmed that RND3 knockdown reduces cAMP- and isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, which were mimicked by treating cells with ROCK inhibitor. This effect could partly be explained by reduced protein expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).We here uncovered a novel differential expression of adipose RND3 in  and insulin resistance, which may at least partly depend on a causal effect of RND3 on adipocyte lipolysis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

After fasting, nearly half of the 264 subjects with FLI ≥ 60 (highest risk category) shifted to a lower category. The improvement of FLI correlated with the number of fasting days (r = -0.20,  < 0.0001) and with the magnitude of BMI reduction (r = 0.14,  = 0.0001). Periodic fasting with concomitant weight reduction leads to significant rapid improvement of FLI in subjects with and without T2DM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663614>Association between Health Insurance and Health among Adults with Diabetes: Evidence from Medicare.</a></h1><p>Gaining Medicare eligibility at age 65 is associated with increased health insurance coverage and reduced medical expenditure risk, but few studies have examined changes in health outcomes among adults with a specific chronic condition. This study assessed the association between Medicare eligibility and health among adults with diabetes.Regression discontinuity design to test for discontinuities in healthcare outcomes at age 65 when most US adults become eligible for Medicare.National Health Interview Survey, 2006-2016.Respondents ages 55 to 74 with diagnosed diabetes (n = 13 455).Primary outcome measures included self-reported fair or poor general health status, any functional limitation, overweight, obese, and body mass index. Secondary outcomes included health insurance coverage, healthcare spending burden, and functional limitations by cause and type.Medicare eligibility was associated with about an 8.0 percentage point reduction in the uninsured rate (95% confidence interval [CI], -9.9 to -6.0 percentage points; P < .001) and declines in high out-of-pocket healthcare expenditures and worry about medical bills. Eligibility was also associated with reductions of about .2 [95% CI, -6.9 to -3.6; P < .001] and 4.7 [95% CI, -7.1 to -2.3; P = .001] percentage points in fair or poor health and any functional limitation, respectively. Declines in functional limitations appeared to be driven by reductions in limitations due to diabetes, arthritis, heart problems, and emotional or behavioral problems.

Objective BE measures were calculated using geographic information systems for 10,008 participants (4463 male, 45%) aged 16-66 years in 14 cities. Participants self-reported proximity to three types of food outlets. Outcomes were body mass index (BMI) and overweight/ status. Male and female weight status associations with BE measures were estimated by generalized additive mixed models. Proportion (95% CI) of overweight (BMI 25 to <30) ranged from 16.6% (13.1, 19.8) to 41.1% (37.3, 44.7), and  (BMI ≥ 30) from 2.9% (1.3, 4.4) to 31.3% (27.7, 34.7), with Hong Kong being the lowest and Cuernavaca, Mexico highest for both proportions. Results differed by sex. Greater street intersection density, public transport density and perceived proximity to restaurants (males) were associated with lower odds of overweight/ (BMI ≥ 25). Proximity to public transport stops (females) was associated with higher odds of overweight/. Composite BE measures were more strongly related to BMI and overweight/ status than single variables among men but not women. One standard deviation improvement in the composite measures of BE was associated with small reductions of 0.1-0.% in BMI but meaningful reductions of 2.-.3% in the odds of overweight/. Effects were linear and generalizable across cities. Neighborhoods designed to support public transport, with food outlets within walking distance, may contribute to global  control.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Of those, 2498 veterans who underwent bariatric surgery were allocated to the surgery cohort. Sequential stratification was used to match each patient in the surgery cohort with up to 3 patients who had not undergone bariatric surgery but were of the same sex, race/ethnicity, diabetes status, and VA regional network and were closest in age, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and comorbidities. A total of 7456 patients were identified and allocated to the nonsurgery (control) cohort. The VA health care expenditures among the surgery and nonsurgery cohorts were estimated using regression models. Data were analyzed from July to August 2018 and in April 2019.The bariatric surgical procedures (n = 2498) included in this study were Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (1842 [73.7%]), sleeve gastrectomy (381 [15.3%]), adjustable gastric banding (249 [10.0%]), and other procedures (26 [1.0%]).The study measured total, outpatient, inpatient, and outpatient pharmacy expenditures from 3 years before surgery to 10 years after surgery, excluding expenditures associated with the initial bariatric surgical procedure.Among 9954 veterans with severe , 7387 (74.2%) were men; the mean (SD) age was 52.3 (8.8) years for the surgery cohort and 52. (8.7) years for the nonsurgery cohort. Mean total expenditures for the surgery cohort were $5093 (95% CI, $4811-$5391) at 7 to 12 months before surgery, which increased to $7448 (95% CI, $6989-$7936) at 6 months after surgery. Postsurgical expenditures decreased to $6692 (95% CI, $6197-$7226) at  years after surgery, followed by a gradual increase to $8495 (95% CI, $7609-$9484) at 10 years after surgery. Total expenditures were higher in the surgery cohort than in the nonsurgery cohort during the 3 years before surgery and in the first 2 years after surgery. The expenditures of the 2 cohorts converged  to 10 years after surgery. Outpatient pharmacy expenditures were significantly lower among the surgery cohort in all years of follow-up ($509 lower at 3 years before surgery and $461 lower at 7 to 12 months before surgery), but these cost reductions were offset by higher inpatient and outpatient (nonpharmacy) expenditures.In this cohort study of 9954 predominantly older male veterans with severe , total health care expenditures increased immediately after patients underwent bariatric surgery but converged with those of patients who had not undergone surgery at 10 years after surgery. This finding suggests that the value of bariatric surgery lies primarily in its associations with improvements in health and not in its potential to decrease health care costs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654282>Multimodal non-invasive monitoring to apply an open lung approach strategy in morbidly obese patients during bariatric surgery.</a></h1><p>To evaluate the use of non-invasive variables for monitoring an open-lung approach (OLA) strategy in bariatric surgery. Twelve morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery received a baseline protective ventilation with 8 cmHO of positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP). Then, the OLA strategy was applied consisting in lung recruitment followed by a decremental PEEP trial, from 20 to 8 cmHO, in steps of 2 cmHO to find the lung's closing pressure. Baseline ventilation was then resumed setting open lung PEEP (OL-PEEP) at 2 cmHO above this pressure. The multimodal non-invasive variables used for monitoring OLA consisted in pulse oximetry (SpO), respiratory compliance (Crs), end-expiratory lung volume measured by a capnodynamic method (EELV), and esophageal manometry. OL-PEEP was detected at 15.9 ± 1.7 cmHO corresponding to a positive end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure (P) of 0.9 ± 1.1 cmHO. ROC analysis showed that SpO was more accurate (AUC 0.92, IC95% 0.87-0.97) than Crs (AUC 0.76, IC95% 0.87-0.97) and EELV (AUC 0.73, IC95% 0.64-0.82) to detect the lung's closing pressure according to the change of P from positive to negative values. Compared to baseline ventilation with 8 cmHO of PEEP, OLA increased EELV (1309 ± 517 vs. 2177 ± 679 mL) and decreased driving pressure (18.3 ± 2.2 vs. 10.1 ± 1.7 cmHO), estimated shunt (17.7 ± 3.4 vs. 4.2 ± 1.4%), lung strain (0.39 ± 0.07 vs. 0.22 ± 0.06) and lung elastance (28.4 ± .8 vs. 15.3 ± 4.3 cmHO/L), respectively; all p < 0.0001. The OLA strategy can be monitored using noninvasive variables during bariatric surgery. This strategy decreased lung strain, elastance and driving pressure compared with standard protective ventilatory settings.Clinical trial number NTC03694665.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662903>Are Nonnutritive Sweeteners Obesogenic?

The study explored changes in the faecal microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) associated with the diet (including nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs)) and evaluated metabolic consequences in subjects with morbid . The diet was assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire. One unit of NNSs was 100 mL beverage with NNSs or 2 tablets/teaspoons of NNSs. The faecal microbiota was assessed with GA-map® dysbiosis test and SCFA with gas chromatography and flame ionisation detection. Fourteen men and 75 women with a mean age of 44.6 (SD 8.7) years, BMI 41.8 (SD 3.6) kg/m, and intake of NNSs 7. units/day (SD 3.2; range 0-43) were included. Faecal butyric acid was positively and negatively associated with the intake of starch (partial correlation = 0.264; =0.015) and NNSs (partial correlation = -0.274; =0.011), respectively. NNSs were associated with changes in four out of 39 bacterial groups. Butyric acid has antiobesogenic effects, reduces insulin resistance, and improves dyslipidaemia. Since the weight-reducing effect of NNSs on obese adults trying to lose weight is dubious, it seems imprudent to use NNSs that might counteract the favourable effects of butyric acid.Copyright © 2019 Per G.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in diet and physical activity, which are secondary outcomes of a community-based, multilevel cardiovascular disease risk reduction intervention designed for women in rural communities.Strong Hearts, Healthy Communities was a six-month, community-randomized trial conducted in 16 rural towns in Montana and New York, USA. Sedentary women aged 40 and older with overweight and  were recruited. Intervention participants (eight towns) attended twice weekly exercise and nutrition classes for 24 weeks (48 total). Individual-level components included aerobic exercise, progressive strength training, and healthy eating practices; a civic engagement component was designed to address social and built environment factors to support healthy lifestyles. The control group (eight towns) attended didactic healthy lifestyle classes monthly (six total). Dietary and physical activity data were collected at baseline and post-intervention. Dietary data were collected using automated self-administered 24-h dietary recalls, and physical activity data were collected by accelerometry and self-report. Data were analyzed using multilevel linear regression models with town as a random effect.At baseline, both groups fell short of meeting many recommendations for cardiovascular health. Compared to the control group, the intervention group realized significant improvements in intake of fruit and vegetables combined (difference: 0.6 cup equivalents per day, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.1, p = .026) and in vegetables alone (difference: 0.3 cup equivalents per day, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.6, p = .016). For physical activity, there were no statistically significant between-group differences based on accelerometry. By self-report, the intervention group experienced a greater increase in walking MET minutes per week (difference: 113. MET-minutes per week, 95% CI 12.8 to 214.2, p = .027).Between-group differences in dietary and physical activity behaviors measured in this study were minimal.

All the patients who underwent polysomnography were analyzed for the presence of OHS. Of 85 patients referred for polysomnography, 76 had SDB. Thirteen patients were excluded because of hypoventilation due to other known causes or could not perform spirometry.The prevalence of OHS among SDB after excluding the other causes of hypoventilation was 15.87% (10/63). The predictors were determined using univariate analysis between daytime partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO) and other predictors. PaCO significantly correlated with minimum nocturnal oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO), FVC %predicted, BMI, daytime SpO, forced expiratory volume %predicted, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO). Following a stepwise multiple regression, minimum nocturnal SpO, FVC %predicted, and BMI were found to be independent predictors of OHS. A minimum nocturnal SpO threshold of 60%, FVC %predicted <74.%, BMI >30.95 kg/m, and absolute FVC <2.33 L for men and <1.68 L for women were found to be predictors of OHS.The prevalence of OHS in Indian patients is similar to Caucasians.

However, disproportionally changing body mass index (BMI) distributions pose particular challenges. Flexible modeling of the shape of BMI distributions may improve prediction performance.We used data from repeated national health surveys conducted in Mexico, Colombia and Peru at four or five time points between 1988 and 2014. Data from all surveys except the last survey were used to construct prediction models for three  indicators (median BMI, overweight/ prevalence and  prevalence) for the time of the last survey. We assessed their performance using predicted curves, absolute prediction errors and comparison of actual and predicted distributions. With one method, we modeled the shape of BMI distributions assuming BMI follows a Box-Cox Power Exponential (BCPE) distribution, whose parameters were modeled as a function of interval or nominal -year age groups, time and their interaction terms. In a second method, we modeled each of the  indicators directly as a function of the same covariates using quantile and logistic regression.The BCPE model with interval age groups yielded the best prediction performance in predicting  prevalence. Average absolute prediction errors across all age groups were 4.3 percentage points (95% percentile interval: 1.9, 7.), 2.

Early screening and prevention of  is critical for averting associated morbidity, disability, and mortality. Ethiopia has been using the international (WHO's) BMI cut-off for diagnosing  even though its validity among Ethiopian population was questioned. To address this problem, a new body mass index cut-off was developed for Ethiopian adults using population-specific data. However, its performance in diagnosing  has not been validated. Therefore, this study determined the performance of the newly developed Ethiopian and World Health Organization (WHO) BMI cut-offs in detecting  among Ethiopian adults.A cross-sectional study was carried out among 704 employees of Jimma University from February to April 2015. The study participants were selected using simple random sampling technique based on their payroll. Data on sociodemographic variables were collected using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. Anthropometric parameters including body weight and height were measured according to WHO recommendation. Body fat percentage (BF%) was measured using the air displacement plethysmography (ADP) after calibration of the machine. The diagnostic accuracy of the WHO BMI cut-off (≥ 30 kg/m) for  in both sexes and Ethiopian BMI cut-off (> 22.2 kg/m for males and >  24. kg/m for females) were compared to  diagnosed using ADP measured body fat percentage (> 35% for females and >  25% for males). Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and kappa agreements were determined to validate the performance of the BMI cut-offs.In males, WHO BMI cut-off has a sensitivity of .3% and specificity of 99.4% (Kappa = 0.047) indicating a slight agreement. However, the Ethiopian cut-off showed a sensitivity of 87.% and specificity of 87.7% (Kappa = 0.752) indicating a substantial agreement. Similarly, in females, the WHO BMI cut-off showed a sensitivity of 46.9%, while its specificity was 100% (Kappa = 0.219) showing a fair agreement. The Ethiopian BMI cut-off demonstrated a sensitivity 80.0% and a specificity 95.6% (Kappa = 0.701) showing a substantial agreement. The WHO BMI cut-off underestimated the prevalence of  by a maximum of 73.7% and by a minimum of 28.3% among males, while the values for underestimation ranged from 31.4-54.1% in females. The misclassification was minimal using the newly developed Ethiopian BMI cut-off. The prevalence of  was underestimated by a maximum of 9.2% and overestimated by a maximum of 6.2%.

However, characterization of the inpatient population with  as a whole has not been reported. We aimed to examine trends in the annual prevalence of  in hospitalized children and to identify demographic and clinical characteristics associated with higher  prevalence in children who are hospitalized.We completed a retrospective cohort analysis of children aged 2 to 19 years admitted to a single tertiary children's hospital system for any reason in 2009-2016. Body mass index was calculated from documented height and weight. Children with  were defined by using age- and sex-specific body mass index percentile guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Annual  prevalence was calculated on the encounter level for service line and All Patients Refined Diagnosis-Related Groups (diagnosis groups). χ tests were used to determine statistical differences between groups, and the Cochran-Armitage test of trend was used to describe changes in  over time.Of 83 329 children who were hospitalized, 17.0% had , increasing from 16.% of hospitalizations in 2009-2010 to 17.3% in 2015-2016 ( = .002).

Seeking the initiating events, we tested the hypothesis that the intestine could be damaged by repeated lipid supply and therefore participate in inflammation. In mice, 1- palm oil gavages increased intestinal permeability via decreased expression and mislocalization of junctional proteins at the cell-cell contacts; altered the intestinal bacterial species by decreasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, segmented filamentous bacteria, and Clostridium leptum; and increased inflammatory cytokine expression. This was further studied in human intestinal epithelial Caco-2/TC7 cells using the two main components of palm oil, i.e., palmitic and oleic acid. Saturated palmitic acid impaired paracellular permeability and junctional protein localization, and induced inflammatory cytokine expression in the cells, but unsaturated oleic acid did not. Inhibiting de novo ceramide synthesis prevented part of these effects. Altogether, our data show that short exposure to palm oil or palmitic acid induces intestinal dysfunctions targeting barrier integrity and inflammation. Excessive palm oil consumption could be an early player in the gut alterations observed in metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Currently, there are little to no data describing prevalences and correlates of movement behaviours among children in low-middle-income countries. The few available reports do not include both urban and rural respondents, despite the large proportion of rural populations in low-middle-income countries. We compared the prevalence of meeting 24-h movement guidelines and examined correlates of meeting the guidelines in a sample of urban and rural Mozambican schoolchildren.This is cross-sectional study of 9-11 year-old children (n = 683) recruited from 10 urban and 7 rural schools in Mozambique. Moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) and sleep duration were measured by waist-worn Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers. Accelerometers were worn 24 h/day for up to 8 days. Recreational screen time was self-reported. Potential correlates of meeting 24-h movement guidelines were directly measured or obtained from validated items of context-adapted questionnaires. Multilevel multivariable logit models were used to determine the correlates of movement behaviours. Meeting 24-h movement guidelines was defined as ≥60 min/day of MVPA, ≤2 h/day of recreational screen time, and between 9 and 11 h/night of sleep.More rural (17.7%) than urban (3.6%) children met all three 24-h movement guidelines. Mean MVPA was lower (82.9 ± 29. min/day) among urban than rural children (96.7 ± 31.8 min/day). Rural children had longer sleep duration (8.9 ± 0.7 h/night) and shorter recreational screen time (2.7 ± 1.9 h/day) than their urban counterparts (8.7 ± 0.9 h/night and .0 ± 2.3 h/day respectively). Parental education (OR: 0.37; CI: 0.16-0.87), school location (OR: 0.21; CI: 0.09-0.52), and outdoor time (OR: 0.67; CI: 0.53-0.85) were significant correlates of meeting all three 24-h movement guidelines.Prevalence and correlates of meeting movement guidelines differed between urban and rural schoolchildren in Mozambique. On average, both groups had higher daily MVPA minutes, shorter sleep duration, and higher recreational screen time than the 24-h movement guidelines recommend. These findings (e.g., higher than recommended mean daily MVPA minutes) differ from those from high-income countries and highlight the need to sample from both urban and rural areas.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668975>Characteristics of newly diagnosed adults with type 1 diabetes in the UK and evolution of glycaemic control, body mass index and Charlson comorbidity index over the first  years after diagnosis.</a></h1><p>This retrospective, longitudinal study characterised 2430 adults (mean age 40.8±16.1years) with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes (T1D) over the first 5years of insulin treatment.Data from 1year pre- and up to  years post-insulin initiation were extracted from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (1990-2013).

South Asia, including Nepal, has higher risks for CAD due to relatively higher exposures to risk factors. This study evaluated the prevalence of lifestyle-related risk factors and the associations of risk factors with socio-demographic variables among CAD patients.A cross-sectional study was conducted among CAD patients (n = 224) admitted to a national heart centre in Nepal. Data on dietary habits, smoking, alcohol consumption, stress, physical activity, overweight or  and adherence to medication were collected using standard questionnaires. The numbers of risk factors were categorised into three groups (1-2 = low, 3 = medium, 4-7 = high). Data analysis was performed by cross-tabulation and multinomial logistic regression. Prevalence odds ratios (POR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used as the measure of the associations.The prevalence of risk factors among patients varied from 23% to 97%, with stress being the most prevalent, and current alcohol consumption the least. The majority of study patients had multiple lifestyle-related risk factors. Male patients (POR for medium vs. low 2.83; 95% CI 1.3, 6.18) and patients with high incomes (POR for high vs. low 2.53; 95% CI 1.10, .83) had higher odds of being in the medium- and high-risk group, respectively.Lifestyle-related risk factors were highly prevalent among CAD patients.

The aim of this study was to describe the clinical differences in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) referred from ENT or other specialists.A prospective study was carried out between June 2015 and July 2018 in a tertiary center. We included patients with suspected OSA referred by the Home Sleep Apnea Test (HSAT) from different specialties such as ENT or other specialties. The main outcome measures of our study were demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, sleep questionnaire results and HSAT results between OSA patients referred from ENT or other specialists. We used a t-test and chi-squared test for analysis. The diagnostic accuracy of the sleep questionnaires was achieved using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC).A total of 481 patients were included. OSA was occurred in 82.4% of the subjects (90 in ENT and 306 in other specialties). Patients with OSA referred from other specialists were older than ENT patients (55 ± 13 vs 44 ± 12; p < 0.001), there was more  (IMC 31 ± .0 vs 28.7 ± 3.8; p < 0,001), a larger neck circumference (42.2 cm ± 3.7 vs 40.6 cm ± 3.0; p < 0.001) and more reported comorbidities (p < 0.001). ENT patients reported mild OSA (46% vs 31%, p = 0.015) and more positional apnea (62% vs 39%, p = 0.002). In this group, the STOP-BANG questionnaire showed an AUC 0.695 vs AUC 0.804, and for sensitivity, the best cutoff was 4 points. Patients referred from otorhinolaryngology are different from those referred from other specialties.

To understand how these interactions contribute to metabolic homeostasis and disease states, we analysed the steady state response of metabolic regulation (catabolic or anabolic) with respect to structural and input perturbations in the integrated signalling network, for varying levels of plasma glucose. Structural perturbations revealed: the positive feedback of AKT on IRS is responsible for the bistability in anabolic zone (glucose >. mmol); the positive feedback of calcium on cAMP is responsible for ensuring ultrasensitive response in catabolic zone (glucose <4. mmol); the crosstalk between AKT and PDE3 is responsible for efficient catabolic response under low glucose condition; the crosstalk between DAG and PKC regulates the span of anabolic bistable region with respect to plasma glucose levels. The macronutrient perturbations revealed: varying plasma amino acids and fatty acids from normal to high levels gradually shifted the bistable response towards higher glucose range, eventually making the response catabolic or unresponsive to increasing glucose levels. The analysis reveals that certain macronutrient composition may be more conducive to homeostasis than others. The network perturbations that may contribute to disease states such as diabetes,  and cancer are discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666192>Hypothalamic C2-domain protein involved in MC4R trafficking and control of energy balance.</a></h1><p>Rates of overweight and  epidemic have risen significantly in the past few decades, and 34% of adults and 15-20% of children and adolescents in the United States are now obese. Melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R), contributes to appetite control in hypothalamic neurons and is a target for future anti- treatments (such as setmelanotide) or novel drug development effort. Proper MC4R trafficking regulation in hypothalamic neurons is crucial for normal neural control of homeostasis and is altered in  and in presence of lipids. The mechanisms underlying altered MC4R trafficking in the context of  is still unclear. Here, we discovered that C2CD5 expressed in the hypothalamus is involved in the regulation of MC4R endocytosis. This study unmasked a novel trafficking protein nutritionally regulated in the hypothalamus providing a novel target for MC4R dependent pathways involved in bodyweight homeostasis and .To evaluate the expression of C2cd5, we first used in situ hybridization and RNAscope technology in combination with electronic microscopy. For in vivo, we characterized the energy balance of wild type (WT) and C2CD5 whole-body knockout (C2CD5KO) mice fed normal chow (NC) and/or western-diet (high-fat/high-sucrose/cholesterol) (WD). To this end, we performed comprehensive longitudinal assessment of bodyweight, energy balance (food intake, energy expenditure, locomotor activity using TSE metabolic cages), and glucose homeostasis. In addition, we evaluated the consequence of loss of C2CD5 on feeding behavior changes normally induced by MC4R agonist (Melanotan, MTII) injection in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH). For in vitro approach, we tease out the role of C2CD5 and its calcium sensing domain C2 in MC4R trafficking. We focused on endocytosis of MC4R using an antibody feeding experiment (in a neuronal cell line - Neuro2A (N2A) stably expressing HA-MC4R-GFP; against HA-tag and analyzed by flux cytometry).We found that 1) the expression of hypothalamic C2CD5 is decreased in diet-induced  models compared to controls, 2) mice lacking C2CD5 exhibit an increase in food intake compared to WT mice, 3) C2CD5 interacts with endocytosis machinery in hypothalamus, 4) loss of functional C2CD5 (lacking C2 domain) blunts MC4R endocytosis in vitro and increases MC4R at the surface that fails to respond to MC4R ligand, and, ) C2CD5KO mice exhibit decreased acute responses to MTII injection into the PVH.Based on these, we conclude that hypothalamic C2CD5 is involved in MC4R endocytosis and regulate bodyweight homeostasis. These studies suggest that C2CD5 represents a new protein regulated by metabolic cues and involved in metabolic receptor endocytosis.

It remains unclear whether there are similar causal effects of  traits on other non-communicable diseases. Also, it is largely unexplored whether there are any sex-specific differences in the causal effects of  traits on cardiometabolic diseases and other leading causes of death. We constructed sex-specific genetic risk scores (GRS) for three  traits; body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and WHR adjusted for BMI, including 565, 324, and 337 genetic variants, respectively. These GRSs were then used as instrumental variables to assess associations between the  traits and leading causes of mortality in the UK Biobank using Mendelian randomization. We also investigated associations with potential mediators, including smoking, glycemic and blood pressure traits. Sex-differences were subsequently assessed by Cochran's Q-test (Phet). A Mendelian randomization analysis of 228,466 women and 195,041 men showed that  causes coronary artery disease, stroke (particularly ischemic), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, type 2 and 1 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic liver disease, and acute and chronic renal failure. Higher BMI led to higher risk of type 2 diabetes in women than in men (Phet = 1.4×10-). Waist-hip-ratio led to a higher risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Phet = 3.7×10-6) and higher risk of chronic renal failure (Phet = 1.0×10-4) in men than women.  traits have an etiological role in the majority of the leading global causes of death.

However, there are only a few reports regarding the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in obese patients with SLE. Herein, we discuss the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) performed in an obese patient with SLE while undergoing long-term steroid therapy.A 36-year-old female, suffering from SLE for 10 years with effects on the central nervous system, developed diabetes mellitus (DM) triggered by the steroid therapy for SLE. The patient was undergoing steroid therapy (6 mg/day) for SLE since a long time. For DM management, her HbA1c level was maintained at 7.4%. She was 158 cm tall and 91.6 kg in weight. Her body mass index was 36.7. She could not work and depended on welfare services. To improve her  and DM, physicians suggested that she should undergo bariatric surgery in our hospital. Eventually, she underwent LSG, which lasted for 185 min, with minimal blood loss and without complications. Her blood glucose level stabilized immediately after the surgery; hence, her antidiabetic medication was discontinued. She was discharged 8 days after surgery, and her weight decreased steadily. In the first year after surgery, her weight was 54.4 kg, and she had lost approximately 37 kg from her initial weight. Her steroid requirement had also reduced to 4 mg/day. Through weight loss, she could begin to work and became a part of society again.LSG was safely performed in an obese patient with SLE undergoing long-term steroid therapy. We noted substantial weight loss, improved DM condition, and reduced requirement of SLE therapy after surgery. Hence, surgical risks must be carefully examined before patients undergo bariatric surgery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656291>The Effect of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy on  and -related Disease : the Results of 10 Initial Cases.</a></h1><p>Introduction : The number of patients who undergo laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has been increasing.

Both groups received standard pregnancy dietary orientation at recruitment, while the intervention group received 8 weeks of real-time food coaching via a smartphone app. This food-coaching smartphone app (Glycoleap, Holmusk, Singapore) aimed to improve care and outcomes for people with diabetes. Pregnant women using this app were able to upload food images (eg, a picture of a meal, a drink, or a dessert) and received real-time and detailed food-coaching comments and guidance provided by professional dietitians during the day (8 AM to 8 PM). We recorded detailed characteristics during recruitment and examined anthropometry at all visits. We compared the mean differences of the 8-week gestational weight gain and macronutrient intake between the two groups.Upon study completion, three subjects dropped out from the intervention, and one gave birth prematurely in the control group. The acceptance rate of the smartphone app was 90%. More participants achieved optimal gestational weight gain per week in the intervention group (8/12, 67%) than in the control group (/14, 36%). After the 8-week intervention, women in the intervention group appeared to have lower gestational weight gain (mean difference=-0.08 kg; 95% CI -1.80 to 1.63) and cholesterol intake (mean difference=-31.73 mg; 95% CI -102.91 to 39.45) than those in the control group.Our findings showed that this food-coaching smartphone app is feasible and favorable for weight gain control and cholesterol intake control among overweight and obese pregnant women. Although our results were not significant (perhaps, attributed to the small sample size), it provided proof of concept for the feasibility of applying such technology in future randomized controlled trials with a larger sample size, an earlier intervention onset, and a longer follow-up for overweight and obese pregnant women.©Ling-Jun Li, Izzuddin M Aris, Wee Meng Han, Kok Hian Tan.

The early identification of high-risk individuals is the key for halting these conditions. The world is facing a growing epidemic MetS although the magnitude in Egypt is unknown.  To describe MetS and its determinants among apparently healthy individuals residing in urban and rural communities in Egypt and to establish a model for MetS prediction.  A cross-sectional study was conducted with 270 adults from rural and urban districts in Alexandria, Egypt. Participants were clinically evaluated and interviewed for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and dietary habits. MetS was defined according to the harmonized criteria set by the AHA/NHLBI. The risk of ischemic heart diseases (IHDs), DM and fatty liver were assessed using validated risk prediction charts. A multiple risk model for predicting MetS was developed, and its performance was compared.  In total, 57.8% of the study population met the criteria for MetS and were at high risk for developing IHD, DM, and fatty liver. Silent CVD risk factors were identified in 20.4% of the participants. In our proposed multivariate logistic regression model, the predictors of MetS were  [OR (95% CI) = 16.3 (6.03-44.0)], morbid  [OR (95% CI) = 21.7 (.3-88.0)], not working [OR (95% CI) = 2.05 (1.1-3.8)], and having a family history of chronic diseases [OR (95% CI) = 4.38 (2.23-8.61)]. Consumption of caffeine once per week protected against MetS by 27.8-fold. The derived prediction rule was accurate in predicting MetS, fatty liver, high risk of DM, and, to a lesser extent, a 10-year lifetime risk of IHD.  Central  and sedentary lifestyles are accountable for the rising rates of MetS in our society. Interventions are needed to minimize the potential predisposition of the Egyptian population to cardiometabolic diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641833>Are There Ideal Small Bowel Limb Lengths for One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB) to Obtain Optimal Weight Loss and Remission of Comorbidities with Minimal Nutritional Deficiencies?</a></h1><p>Ideal jejunal and ileal lengths in bariatric/metabolic procedures to be left in alimentary continuity still remain unclear. We aimed to evaluate different lengths of biliopancreatic limb (BPL) and common limb (CL) performed in a series of patients submitted to OAGB, and correlate them with weight loss and nutritional deficits.A prospective observational study of 350 consecutive morbidly obese patients undergoing OAGB was performed. BPL and CL lengths were determined intraoperatively; BPL/TBL and CL/TBL ratios were then calculated. Anthropometric variables, remission of comorbidities and specific supplementation needs were recorded at 1, 2 and  years after surgery.Three hundred patients were included for final analysis. BPL length and BPL/TBL ratio directly correlated with Units of BMI lost (UBMIL). Conversely, CL length and CL/TBL ratio showed an inverse correlation with UBMIL. Establishing a BMI ≤ 25 kg/m as ideal, the most accurate AUC, to predict achieving an ideal BMI at 1, 2 and  years after surgery, was obtained for the CL/TBL ratio, followed by the CL length at 1, 2 and  years. An ideal range was established between 0.40 and 0.43 for the CL/TBL ratio, and 200 to 220 cm for the CL length. Among these ranges, there were no cases of protein or calorie malnutrition.TBL measurement is essential to obtain optimal outcomes after OAGB, both in terms of excellent weight loss and remission/improvement of comorbidities, as well as with a low risk of nutritional deficiencies. The CL/TBL ratio, followed by CL length, are the most accurate parameters to predict a -year postoperative BMI ≤ 25 kg/m.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657248>Kidney dysfunction induced by sucrose-rich diet in rat involves mitochondria ROS generation, cardiolipin changes and the decline of autophagy protein markers.</a></h1><p>The mechanistic link between  and renal failure has been proposed to involve mitochondria reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and lipotoxicity. These pathological conditions make mitochondria of a particular interest in the regulation of cell function and death by both apoptosis and autophagy. Therefore, this work was undertaken to investigate mitochondria function, autophagy and apoptosis protein markers in the kidney from rat model of intra-abdominal  and renal damage induced by high sucrose diet. Mitochondria from sucrose fed (SF) kidney in the presence of pyruvate/malate generated hydrogen peroxide (HO) at a higher rate than from control (79.81 ± 4.98 vs 65.84 ± 1.95 pmol/min/mg protein). With succinate, the release of HO was significantly higher compared with pyruvate/malate and it remained higher in SF than in control mitochondria (146.4 ± 8.8 vs 106.1 ± .9 pmol/min/mg protein). However, cytochrome c release from SF kidney mitochondria was lower than from control. In addition, cardiolipin, a mitochondrial-specific phospholipid was found increased in SF mitochondria due to the enhanced amount of both cardiolipin synthase and tafazzin. Cardiolipin was also found enriched with saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids which are less susceptible to peroxidative stress involved in cytochrome c release. Furthermore, Beclin-1, LC3-B, as autophagy protein markers, and caspase 9 as apoptosis protein marker, were found decreased in SF kidney. These results suggest that the decline of autophagy protein markers and the lack of apoptosis process could be a pathological mechanism of cell dysfunction leading to the progression of renal disease in SF rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651605>Non Communicable Disease risk factors among a cohort of mine workers in Mongolia.</a></h1><p>Prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCD) is growing among workers globally, causing 71% of all premature deaths.

A total of 101 postmenopausal women, aged 45 to 65 years with body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) from 30 to 40, who were at least  years after menopause, had fewer than 3 hours of structured physical activity per week, and lived in the Sydney metropolitan area of New South Wales, Australia, were recruited between March 2013 and July 2016. Data analysis was conducted between October 2018 and August 2019.Participants were randomized to either 12 months of moderate (25%-35%) energy restriction with a food-based diet (moderate intervention) or 4 months of severe (65%-75%) energy restriction with a total meal replacement diet followed by moderate energy restriction for an additional 8 months (severe intervention). Both interventions had a prescribed protein intake of 1.0 g/kg of actual body weight per day, and physical activity was encouraged but not supervised.The primary outcome was whole-body lean mass at 12 months after commencement of intervention. Secondary outcomes were body weight, thigh muscle area and muscle function (strength), bone mineral density, and fat mass and distribution, measured at 0, 4, 6, and 12 months.A total of 101 postmenopausal women were recruited (mean [SD] age, 58.0 [4.2] years; mean [SD] weight, 90.8 [9.1] kg; mean [SD] body mass index, 34.4 [2.]). Compared with the moderate group at 12 months, the severe group lost more weight (effect size, -6.6 kg; 95% CI, -8.2 to -.1 kg), lost more whole-body lean mass (effect size, -1.2 kg; 95% CI, -2.0 to -0.4 kg), and lost more thigh muscle area (effect size, -4.2 cm2; 95% CI, -6. to -1.9 cm2). However, decreases in whole-body lean mass and thigh muscle area were proportional to total weight loss, and there was no difference in muscle (handgrip) strength between groups. Total hip bone mineral density (effect size, -0.017 g/cm2; 95% CI, -0.029 to -0.005 g/cm2), whole-body fat mass (effect size, -. kg; 95% CI, -7.1 to -3.9 kg), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (effect size, -1890 cm3; 95% CI, -2560 to -1219 cm3), and visceral adipose tissue (effect size, -1389 cm3; 95% CI, -1748 to -1030 cm3) loss were also greater for the severe group than for the moderate group at 12 months.Severe energy restriction had no greater adverse effect on relative whole-body lean mass or handgrip strength compared with moderate energy restriction and was associated with 2-fold greater weight and fat loss over 12 months. However, there was significantly greater loss of total hip bone mineral density with severe vs moderate energy restriction. Therefore, caution is necessary when implementing severe energy restriction in postmenopausal women, particularly those with osteopenia or osteoporosis.anzctr.org.au Identifier: 12612000651886.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660948>The human gut bacteria Christensenellaceae are widespread, heritable, and associated with health.</a></h1><p>The Christensenellaceae, a recently described family in the phylum Firmicutes, is emerging as an important player in human health. The relative abundance of Christensenellaceae in the human gut is inversely related to host body mass index (BMI) in different populations and multiple studies, making its relationship with BMI the most robust and reproducible link between the microbial ecology of the human gut and metabolic disease reported to date. The family is also related to a healthy status in a number of other different disease contexts, including  and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, Christensenellaceae is highly heritable across multiple populations, although specific human genes underlying its heritability have so far been elusive. Further research into the microbial ecology and metabolism of these bacteria should reveal mechanistic underpinnings of their host-health associations and enable their development as therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662187>Correlates of psychiatric inpatient readmissions of children and adolescents with mental disorders.</a></h1><p>To identify correlates of psychiatric readmission of youth, we conducted a consecutive, retrospective 1-year cohort study (07.01.2014-06.30.2015) of youth (age = -17.9) admitted to psychiatric inpatient facility. Stepwise elimination, multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify independent correlates of 1-year and 30-day psychiatric readmissions. The Family/Caregiver Interview Tool (FCIT) was given to caregivers of 30-day readmitted youth and analyzed using generalized linear model to predict time to readmission. Altogether, 1231 youth experienced 1534 hospitalizations. The 1-year readmission rate was 32.4%; 30-day readmission rate was 10.2%. Significant independent correlates of readmissions were longer length of stay, higher antipsychotic treatment rates, living closer to the hospital, and comorbid , all accounting for 12.2% of variance. FCIT revealed that caregiver's ability to fill prescription after discharge delayed readmission, while shorter time to follow-up appointment hastened it. Illness exacerbation was responsible for 73% of 30-day readmissions; system of care factors accounted for 13%. Compared to clinicians, caregivers significantly underestimated environment of care factors (including caregiver's mental health) as the primary cause for readmission. Readmissions are common and correlate with illness severity and systems of care factors. Family support services may help reduce readmissions. Hospital-specific qualitative investigation may help identify intervention targets to reduce readmissions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Structural simplification is a powerful strategy for improving the efficiency and success rate of drug design by avoiding "molecular ". The structural simplification of large or complex lead compounds by truncating unnecessary groups can not only improve their synthetic accessibility but also improve their pharmacokinetic profiles, reduce side effects and so on. This review will summarize the application of structural simplification in lead optimization. Numerous case studies, particularly those involving successful examples leading to marketed drugs or drug-like candidates, will be introduced and analyzed to illustrate the design strategies and guidelines for structural simplification.© 2019 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

However, it is unclear whether this effect extends to the extremely obese. In this large multicenter registry-based study, we sought to examine the relationship between BMI and long-term clinical outcomes following PCI, and in particular to evaluate the association between extreme  and long-term survival after PCI. Methods and Results This cohort study included 25 413 patients who underwent PCI between January 1, 2005 and June 30, 2017, who were prospectively enrolled in the Melbourne Interventional Group registry. Patients were stratified by World Health Organization-defined BMI categories. The primary end point was National Death Index-linked mortality. The median length of follow-up was 4.4 years (interquartile range 2.0-7.6 years). Of the study cohort, 24.8% had normal BMI (18.-24.9 kg/m), and 3.3% were extremely obese (BMI ≥40 kg/m). Patients with greater degrees of  were younger and included a higher proportion of diabetics (<0.001). After adjustment for age and comorbidities, a J-shaped association was observed between different BMI categories and adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for long-term mortality (normal BMI, HR 1.00 [ref]; overweight, HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78-0.93, <0.001; mild , HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76-0.94, =0.002; moderate , HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.80-1.12, =0.54; extreme  HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.07-1.65, =0.01). Conclusions An  paradox is still apparent in contemporary practice, with elevated BMI up to 35 kg/m associated with reduced long-term mortality after PCI. However, this protective effect appears not to extend to patients with extreme .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640864>Guideline No. 391-Pregnancy and Maternal  Part 1: Pre-conception and Prenatal Care.</a></h1><p>This guideline will review key aspects in the pregnancy care of women with .

However, this practice may be unnecessarily burdensome and time-consuming in the research setting.The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of SS criteria, and compare it to alternative approaches in adults with overweight and .In this cross-sectional, ancillary analysis, participants enrolled in a bariatric (study 1; n = 13) and lifestyle (study 2; n = 51) weight loss intervention were included. Indirect calorimetry was performed during baseline measurements using a metabolic cart for 25 min, including a -min stabilization period at the start. SS was defined as the first -min period with a coefficient of variation (CV) ≤10% for both VO and VCO (hereafter REE). Body composition was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis in study 2 participants only. REE was compared against the lowest CV (REE), -min time intervals (REE, REE, REE, REE), 4-min and 3-min SS intervals (REE and REE), and time intervals of 6-15, 6-20 and 6-25 min (REE, REE, and REE) using repeated measures ANOVA and Bland-Altman analysis to test for bias, limits of agreement and accuracy (±6% measured REE).Participants were 54 ± 13 years old, mostly women (75%) and had a BMI of 35 ±  kg/m. Overall, 54/63 (84%) of participants reached REE, often (47/54, 87%) within the first 10-min (6-15 min). Alternative approaches to estimating REE had a relatively low bias (-16 to 13 kcals), narrow limits of agreement and high accuracy (83-98%) when compared to REE, in particular, outperforming standard prediction equations (e.g., Mifflin St. Joer).Indirect calorimetry measurements that utilize the -min SS approach to estimate REE are considered the gold-standard. Under circumstances of non-SS, it appears 4-min and 3-min SS periods, or fixed time intervals of atleast  min are accurate and practical alternatives for estimating REE in adults with overweight and . However, future trials should validate alternative methods in similar populations to confirm these findings.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

However, there are several limitations in the current literature. These include an inability to distinguish between planned and emergency CS, small study sample sizes and not adjusting for pre-pregnancy body-mass-index (BMI). We examined the association between CS delivery and childhood  using the United Kingdom Millennium Cohort Study (MCS).Mother-infant pairs were recruited into the MCS. Use of sampling weights ensured the sample was representative of the population. The exposure was categorised as normal vaginal delivery (VD) [reference], assisted VD, planned CS and emergency CS. Childhood  prevalence, at age three, five, seven, eleven and fourteen years was calculated using the International  Taskforce criteria. Mixed-effects linear regression models were fitted with associations adjusted for several potential confounders like maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, education and infant macrosomia. Linear regression models were fitted evaluating body fat percentage (BF%), at age seven and fourteen years.Of the 18,116 infants, 3872 (21.4%) were delivered by CS; 9.2% by planned CS.  prevalence was .4%, .7%, 6.%, 7.1% and 7.6% at age three, five, seven, eleven and fourteen years respectively. The mixed-effects linear regression model showed no association between planned (adjusted mean difference = 0.00; [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.10; 0.10], p-value = 0.97) or emergency CS (adjusted mean difference = 0.08; [95% CI -0.01; 0.17], p-value = 0.09) and child BMI. At age seven years, there was no association between planned CS and BF% (adjusted mean difference = 0.13; [95% CI -0.23; 0.49]); there was no association at age fourteen years.Infants born by planned CS did not have a significantly higher BMI or BF% compared to those born by normal VD. This may suggest that the association, described in the literature, could be due to the indications/reasons for CS birth or residual confounding.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649277>Understanding childhood  in the US: the NIH environmental influences on child health outcomes (ECHO) program.</a></h1><p>Few resources exist for prospective, longitudinal analysis of the relationships between early life environment and later  in large diverse samples of children in the United States (US). In 2016, the National Institutes of Health launched the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program to investigate influences of environmental exposures on child health and development. We describe demographics and overweight and  prevalence in ECHO, and ECHO's potential as a resource for understanding how early life environmental factors affect  risk.In this cross-sectional study of 70 extant US and Puerto Rico cohorts, 2003-2017, we examined age, race/ethnicity, and sex in children with body mass index (BMI) data, including 28,507 full-term post-birth to <2 years and 38,332 aged 2-18 years. Main outcomes included high BMI for age <2 years, and at 2-18 years overweight (BMI 85th to <95th percentile),  (BMI ≥ 95th percentile), and severe  (BMI ≥ 120% of 95th percentile).The study population had diverse race/ethnicity and maternal demographics. Each outcome was more common with increasing age and varied with race/ethnicity. High BMI prevalence (95% CI) was 4.7% (3., 6.0) <1 year, and 10.6% (7.4, 13.7) for 1 to <2 years; overweight prevalence increased from 13.9% (12.4, 15.9) at 2-3 years to 19.9% (11.7, 28.2) at 12 to <18 years. ECHO has the statistical power to detect relative risks for 'high' BMI ranging from 1.2 to 2.2 for a wide range of exposure prevalences (1-50%) within each age group.ECHO is a powerful resource for understanding influences of chemical, biological, social, natural, and built environments on onset and trajectories of  in US children. The large sample size of ECHO cohorts adopting a standardized protocol for new data collection of varied exposures along with longitudinal assessments will allow refined analyses to identify drivers of childhood .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646144>Characteristics of influenza in elderly patients with and without diabetes, hospitalized for severe acute respiratory infection in a tertiary care hospital from Bucharest Romania - a three-year prospective epidemiological surveillance study.</a></h1><p>Patients with diabetes may be at a higher risk of developing complicated influenza. We report the characteristics of influenza in hospitalized elderly patients with and without diabetes, in three consecutive influenza seasons.The study included patients admitted for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in the National Institute for Infectious Diseases "Prof. Dr. Matei Balș", Bucharest, during a three-year active epidemiological surveillance study (2015/16, 2016/17, 2017/18), in the I-MOVE+ hospital network.A total of 349 patients were tested by PCR over the duration of the study. The percentage of patients with diabetes was comparable throughout the seasons: 34.7%, 28.3% and 30.4% (p=0.587). Influenza A was the main viral type circulating in 2015/16 and 2016/17 (100% and 97.6%) in our study population, while in 2017/18, B viruses predominated (90.0%). Diabetics presented a higher median number of comorbidities (3 vs. 2) p<0.001, and two-fold higher odds of also associating  (OR=2.1, 95%CI:1.3-3.4, p=0.003), compared to those without diabetes. Diabetics also tested positive for influenza more often (p=0.296). Only 6 patients with diabetes (.4%) from our study had been vaccinated against influenza, and most (n=4) of those who had been vaccinated tested negative for influenza.Our study is the first to describe the circulation of influenza viral types in elderly diabetic patients hospitalized for SARI. The results reinforce the national and international recommendation to vaccinate against influenza all patients with diabetes.GERMS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668939>The Separate Contributions of Visceral Fat and Liver Fat to Chronic Kidney Disease-Related Renal Outcomes.</a></h1><p>This study aims to investigate the separate contributions of liver fat and visceral fat on microalbuminuria and impaired renal function, and second, to examine whether non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is causally related to microalbuminuria and/or impaired renal function.Associations between visceral adipose tissue (VAT), hepatic triglyceride content (HTGC), and risk of microalbuminuria and renal function were studied cross-sectionally in the Netherlands Epidemiology of  study. Mendelian randomization using GWAS meta-analysis data was performed to estimate the causal effect of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (PNPLA3, LYPLAL1, NCAN, GCKR) on eGFR (N 118,460), microalbuminuria (N 54,116), and impaired renal function (N 118,147).In total, 2,023 participants (mean age 55. ± 6.0 years, 53% women) were included of which 29% had fatty liver and 2.0% chronic kidney disease stage ≥3. In joint models, VAT was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of microalbuminuria which was mainly driven by the association in women (total population: per standard deviation [SD] = 55.4 cm, odds ratio [OR] 2.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-3.47; women: OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.44, .56), but HTGC was not (total population: per SD = 7.9%, OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.85, 1.70). No associations were found for VAT and HTGC with eGFR (VAT: per SD = 55.4 cm, OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.83, 1.87; HTGC: per SD = 7.9%, OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.42, 0.99). No causal effect of NAFLD on microalbuminuria or impaired renal function was found.In observational analyses, visceral fat was associated with microalbuminuria in women. Liver fat was not associated with microalbuminuria or renal function, which was supported by Mendelian randomization. Visceral fat might be more important than liver fat in the etiology of microalbuminuria.Copyright © 2019 National Kidney Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

These structural variants are present in 0.% to 1.0% of the population, making 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 the site of the most prevalent known pathogenic copy number variation (CNV). It is unknown to what extent this CNV influences brain structure and affects cognitive abilities.To determine the association of the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 deletion and duplication CNVs with cortical and subcortical brain morphology and cognitive task performance.In this genetic association study, T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging were combined with genetic data from the ENIGMA-CNV consortium and the UK Biobank, with a replication cohort from Iceland. In total, 203 deletion carriers, 45 247 noncarriers, and 306 duplication carriers were included. Data were collected from August 2015 to April 2019, and data were analyzed from September 2018 to September 2019.The associations of the CNV with global and regional measures of surface area and cortical thickness as well as subcortical volumes were investigated, correcting for age, age2, sex, scanner, and intracranial volume. Additionally, measures of cognitive ability were analyzed in the full UK Biobank cohort.Of 45 756 included individuals, the mean (SD) age was 55.8 (18.3) years, and 23 754 (51.9%) were female. Compared with noncarriers, deletion carriers had a lower surface area (Cohen d = -0.41; SE, 0.08; P = 4.9 × 10-8), thicker cortex (Cohen d = 0.36; SE, 0.07; P = 1.3 × 10-7), and a smaller nucleus accumbens (Cohen d = -0.27; SE, 0.07; P = 7.3 × 10-). There was also a significant negative dose response on cortical thickness (β = -0.24; SE, 0.05; P = 6.8 × 10-7). Regional cortical analyses showed a localization of the effects to the frontal, cingulate, and parietal lobes. Further, cognitive ability was lower for deletion carriers compared with noncarriers on  of 7 tasks.These findings, from the largest CNV neuroimaging study to date, provide evidence that 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 structural variation is associated with brain morphology and cognition, with deletion carriers being particularly affected. The pattern of results fits with known molecular functions of genes in the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 region and suggests involvement of these genes in neuronal plasticity. These neurobiological effects likely contribute to the association of this CNV with neurodevelopmental disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640727>Metabolic signature of -associated insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.</a></h1><p> is associated with an increased risk of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, some obese individuals maintain their insulin sensitivity and exhibit a lower risk of associated comorbidities. The underlying metabolic pathways differentiating obese insulin sensitive (OIS) and obese insulin resistant (OIR) individuals remain unclear.In this study, 107 subjects underwent untargeted metabolomics of serum samples using the Metabolon platform. Thirty-two subjects were lean controls whilst 75 subjects were obese including 20 OIS, 41 OIR, and 14 T2DM individuals.Our results showed that phospholipid metabolites including choline, glycerophosphoethanolamine and glycerophosphorylcholine were significantly altered from OIS when compared with OIR and T2DM individuals. Furthermore, our data confirmed changes in metabolic markers of liver disease, vascular disease and T2DM, such as 3-hydroxymyristate, dimethylarginine and 1,-anhydroglucitol, respectively.This pilot data has identified phospholipid metabolites as potential novel biomarkers of -associated insulin sensitivity and confirmed the association of known metabolites with increased risk of -associated insulin resistance, with possible diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

Observational studies in COPD indicate that low body mass index (BMI) is associated with worse outcomes, and overweight/ has a protective effect - the so-called " paradox". We aimed to determine the relationship between BMI and the rate of FEV decline in data from published clinical trials in COPD.We performed a systematic review of the literature, and identified  randomized controlled trials reporting the association between BMI and FEV decline. Four of these were included in the meta-analyses. We analyzed BMI in 4 categories: BMI-I (< 18. or <  20 kg/m), BMI-II (18. or 20 to < 25 kg/m), BMI-III (25 to < 29 or < 30 kg/m) and BMI-IV (≥29 or ≥ 30 kg/m). We then performed a meta-regression of all the estimates against the BMI category.The estimated rate of FEV decline decreased with increasing BMI. Meta-regression of the estimates showed that BMI was significantly associated with the rate of FEV decline (linear trend p = 1.21 × 10).These novel findings support the  paradox in COPD: compared to normal BMI, low BMI is a risk factor for accelerated lung function decline, whilst high BMI has a protective effect. The relationship may be due to common but as-of-yet unknown causative factors; further investigation into which may reveal novel endotypes or targets for therapeutic intervention.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674694>Sarcolipin expression in human skeletal muscle: influence of energy balance and exercise.</a></h1><p>Sarcolipin (SLN) is a SERCAs uncoupling protein associated with exercise performance and lower adiposity in mice. To determine SLN protein expression in human skeletal muscle and its relationship with adiposity, resting energy expenditure (REE), and performance, SLN was assessed by Western blot in 199 biopsies from two previous studies. In one study, 15 overweight volunteers underwent a pre-test followed by four days of caloric restriction and exercise (45min one-arm cranking + 8h walking), and three days on a control diet. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the trained and non-exercised deltoid, and vastus lateralis (VL). In another study, 16 men performed seven sessions of 4-6x30-sec all-out sprints on the cycle ergometer with both limbs, and their VL and triceps brachii biopsied pre- and post-training. SLN expression was two-fold and 44% higher in the VL than in the deltoids and triceps brachii, respectively. SLN was associated neither with adiposity nor REE, and was not altered by a severe energy deficit (,500 kcal/d). SLN and cortisol changes after the energy deficit were correlated (r=0.38, P=0.039). SLN was not altered by low-intensity exercise in the overweight subjects, whereas it was reduced after sprint training in the other group. The changes in SLN with sprint training were inversely associated with the changes in gross efficiency (r=-0.59, P=0.016). No association was observed between aerobic or anaerobic performance and SLN expression. In conclusion, sarcolipin appears to play no role in regulating the fat mass of men. Sprint training reduces sarcolipin expression, which may improve muscle efficiency.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We examined the association between BMI and pancreatic cancer mortality among 963,317 adults aged 30-89 years at enrollment into Cancer Prevention Study-II in 1982. During follow-up through 2014, 8,354 participants died of pancreatic cancer. Hazard ratios (HRs) per  BMI-units, calculated using proportional hazards regression, declined steadily with age at BMI assessment, from 1.25 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18, 1.33) in those aged 30-49 at enrollment to 1.13 (95% CI 1.02, 1.26) in those aged 70-89 (p-trend=0.005). Based on a HR of 1.25 per  BMI-units at age 45, we estimate 28% of US pancreatic cancer deaths in those born from 1970-74 will be attributable to BMI>25, nearly twice the equivalent proportion in those born in the 1930s, a birth cohort with much lower BMI in middle age.

Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overactivity, especially in the kidneys, is an important mechanism linking  to hypertension. Some adipokines play important roles in elevating blood pressure (BP). Hyperinsulinemia caused by insulin resistance stimulates sodium reabsorption, enhances sodium retention, and increases circulating plasma volume. Hyperinsulinemia also stimulates both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the SNS, resulting in the acceleration of atherosclerosis through the hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells, which contributes to increased peripheral vascular resistance.  is associated with increased RAAS activity despite volume overload, as the tissue RAASs are stimulated in obese hypertensive individuals. Mineralocorticoid receptor-associated hypertension must also be considered in obese patients with resistant hypertension. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Some components of the gut microbiota contribute to BP control; therefore, gut dysbiosis caused by  might lead to increased BP. The ratio of visceral fat to subcutaneous fat is higher in Japanese patients than in Caucasian patients, which may explain why Japanese patients are more susceptible to metabolic disorders even though they are less obese than Caucasian individuals. -associated kidney dysfunction directly increases BP, leading to further deterioration of kidney function. A bodyweight reduction of more than 3% or  kg significantly lowers BP. Gastrointestinal bypass surgery is an effective treatment for morbid  and its related metabolic disorders, including hypertension. Because both  and hypertension are representative lifestyle-related disorders, lifestyle modification, especially to improve , should be performed first as a treatment for hypertension.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674938>Perivascular adipose tissue in cardiovascular diseases-an update.</a></h1><p>The perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has been recently recognized as an important factor in vascular biology, with implications in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The cell types and the precursor cells of PVAT appear to be different according to their location, with the component cell type including white, brown, and beige adipocytes. PVAT releases a panel of adipokines and cytokines that maintain vascular homeostasis, but it also has the ability of intervention in the pathogenesis of the atherosclerotic plaques development and in the vascular tone modulation. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge and discuss the role of PVAT as a major contributing factor in the pathogenesis of ischemic coronary disease, hypertension, , and diabetes mellitus. The new perspective of PVAT as an endocrine organ, along with the recent knowledge of the mechanisms involved in dysfunctional PVAT intervention in local vascular homeostasis perturbations, nowadays represent a new area of research in cardiovascular pathology, aiming to discover new therapeutic methods.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675159>Childhood  and the Food Environment: A Population-Based Sample of Public School Children in New York City.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to examine the relationship between proximity to healthy and unhealthy food outlets around children's homes and their weight outcomes.A total of 3,507,542 student-year observations of height and weight data from the 2009-2013 annual FitnessGram assessment of New York City public school students were used. BMI z scores were calculated, student  or /overweight was determined using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts, and these data were combined with the locations of four food outlet types (fast-food restaurants, wait-service restaurants, corner stores, and supermarkets) to calculate distance to the nearest outlet. Associations between weight status outcomes and distance to these food outlet types were examined using neighborhood (census tract) fixed effects.Living farther than 0.025 mile (about half of a city block) from the nearest fast-food restaurant was associated with lower  and /overweight risk and lower BMI z scores. Results ranged from 2.% to 4.4% decreased . Beyond this distance, there were generally no impacts of the food environment and little to no impact of other food outlet types.Proximity to fast-food restaurants was inversely related to childhood , but no relationships beyond that were seen. These findings can help better inform policies focused on food access, which could, in turn, reduce childhood .© 2019 The  Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666643>Empagliflozin and Dulaglutide are Effective against -induced Airway Hyperresponsiveness and Fibrosis in A Murine Model.</a></h1><p>Patients with asthma with  experience severe symptoms, are unresponsive to conventional asthma treatment, and lack proper pharmacotherapy. Empagliflozin and dulaglutide, developed for diabetes, reduce weight, decrease insulin resistance, and exert additive effects. We evaluated the efficacy of empagliflozin, dulaglutide, and their combination on -induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and lung fibrosis using a murine model. We assigned C57BL/6J mice to five groups: control, high-fat diet (HFD), and HFD with empagliflozin, dulaglutide, or both. Mice received a 12-week HFD, empagliflozin ( days/week, oral gavage), and dulaglutide (once weekly, intraperitoneally). Both drugs significantly attenuated HFD-induced weight increase, abnormal glucose metabolism, and abnormal serum levels of leptin and insulin, and co-treatment was more effective. Both drugs significantly alleviated HFD-induced AHR, increased macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and co-treatment was more effective on AHR. HFD-induced lung fibrosis was decreased by both drugs alone and combined. HFD induced interleukin (IL)-17, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and IL-1β mRNA and protein expression, which was significantly reduced by empagliflozin, dulaglutide, and their combination. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-6 showed similar patterns without significant differences. HFD-enhanced T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cell differentiation was improved by both drugs. Empagliflozin and dulaglutide could be a promising therapy for -induced asthma and showed additive effects in combination.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664915>'Weighty issues' in GP-led antenatal care: a qualitative study.</a></h1><p>Approximately 50% of women gain weight in excess of gestational weight gain (GWG) recommendations during pregnancy leading to adverse maternal and foetal outcomes and the perpetuation of the cycle of . Antenatal care provided by a general practitioner (GP) in the primary care setting is an important model of care, particularly for women in regional areas where rates of overweight and  are highest. The aim of this study is to explore GPs' perceptions and experiences of implementing GWG recommendations in GP-led antenatal care.A qualitative exploratory approach recorded GPs' experiences and insights regarding the application of GWG recommendations in practice. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews informed by the revised Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Deductive thematic analysis grouped coded text into TDF domains from which main themes were generated.Twenty GPs (13 female, 7 male) from metropolitan and regional Victoria, Australia participated. Codes related to at least one of 11 TDF domains. Five main themes were apparent: 1) Despite low awareness of guidelines, GWG advice is provided; 2) 'I should do this more'; 3) Lack of everyday resources; 4) Working 'against the odds' at times; and ) Optimism and reality. GPs were aware of the importance of optimal GWG however, other pregnancy-related issues are given precedence during consultations. Enablers for the implementation of GWG guidelines were practitioner-based and included GPs' strong sense of their professional role to provide advice, and ongoing and trusting relationships with women throughout pregnancy. Barriers were mostly health system-based with limited time, remuneration, and restrictive referral pathways being limiting factors.There is a need to support GPs to provide GWG advice in accordance with current national guidelines. Solutions potentially lie in strategies that promote the effective dissemination and uptake of guidelines, and changes to policy and funding within the health-system so that longer GP-led antenatal care consultations are remunerated and referrals to allied health are accessible to women who require additional support to optimise GWG.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664519>Dietary intervention using (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a fungus-derived soluble prebiotic ameliorates high-fat diet-induced metabolic distress and alters beneficially the gut microbiota in mice model.</a></h1><p>Western diet, rich in carbohydrates and fat, is said to be a major factor underlying metabolic syndrome. Interventions with prebiotics, the key modulators of the gut microbiota, have paramount impact on host-associated metabolic disorders. Herein, we investigated the effect of fungus-derived (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a highly soluble dietary fiber, on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic distress.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with different diet groups (n = 11): control diet, HFD, 3 g/kg or  g/kg of β-glucan-incorporated HFD. At the end of experimental study period (12th week), body weight, feces weight and fecal moisture content were observed. Further, colonic motility was measured using activated charcoal meal study. Proteins extracted from liver and intestine tissues were subjected to western blot technique. Paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues were sectioned for histochemical [Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue (AB) staining] analysis. Fecal microbiota analysis was performed using MOTHUR bioinformatic software.β-glucan consumption exhibited anti- property in mice groups fed with HFD. In addition, β-glucan ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic stress, colonic motility and intestinal atrophy (reduction in colon length, goblet cells, and mucosal layer thickness). Further, β-glucan incorporation shifted bacterial community by increasing butyrate-producing bacteria such as Anaerostipes, Coprobacillus, and Roseburia and decreasing reportedly -associated bacteria such as Parabacteroides and Lactococcus.Altogether, the outcomes of this present pre-clinical animal study show β-glucan to be a promising therapeutic candidate in the treatment of HFD-induced metabolic distress. Further comprehensive research has to be conducted to brace its clinical relevance, reproducibility and efficacy for aiding human health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665015>The management of very low-calorie ketogenic diet in  outpatient clinic: a practical guide.</a></h1><p>The epidemic of  is growing steadily across the whole world.  is not only a merely aesthetic disease but is the "mother" of most chronic diseases such as associated with a range of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and cancer. However, although there is a need to find a strategy to stop this epidemic disease, most of the times the current nutritional strategies are not effective in weight loss and in long term weight maintenance. Very low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) is increasingly establishing as a successful nutritional pattern to manage ; this is due to rapid weight loss that gives rise to a positive psychological cycle which in turn increases the compliance to diet. Another important key point of VLCKD is the ability to preserve fatty free mass which is known to play a role of paramount importance in glucose metabolism. Despite the clinical evidence of VLCKD there are paucity of data regarding to its management. Therefore, we will provide a useful guide to be used by nutrition experts taking care of subjects with . In particular, we will report recommendations on the correct use of this therapeutic approach for weight loss and management of side effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652691>Ethnic Variations in Nutritional Status among Preschool Children in Northern Vietnam: A Cross-Sectional Study.</a></h1><p>(1) Background: Vietnam is a multiethnic country undergoing rapid economic development, the improvement in nutritional status in preschool children is not equally shared by all ethnic groups; (2) Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed from September-December 2018 on 16,177 children aged 24-60 months representing Kinh ( = 14421), Muong ( = 1307) and Tay ( = 449) ethnic groups. Prevalence of malnutrition, overweight,  and anthropometric indices were compared across ethnic groups, using WHO 2006 child growth standards; (3) Results: The prevalence of malnutrition among children of Kinh, Muong and Tay origins was 14.7%, 34.3% and 43.2%, respectively. The corresponding data for overweight was .%, 2.7%, 2.2% and for  2.8%, 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively. The prevalence of stunting remained the highest in three subtypes of malnutrition in all ethnic groups. Kinh children were heavier and taller than the other groups, while Muong children were taller than Tay children (-value < 0.001); and (4) Conclusions: Malnutrition remains a major public health issue among children of minor ethnicities while overweight and  is an emerging challenge for the Kinh ethnic group. The results imply that a community-based intervention should be specific to ethnicity to reduce the gap in nutritional status between ethnic groups in Vietnam.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665997>Association Between Neighborhood Walkability and Predicted 10-Year Cardiovascular Disease Risk: The CANHEART (Cardiovascular Health in Ambulatory Care Research Team) Cohort.</a></h1><p>Background Individuals living in unwalkable neighborhoods appear to be less physically active and more likely to develop , diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. It is unclear whether neighborhood walkability is a risk factor for future cardiovascular disease. Methods and Results We studied residents living in major urban centers in Ontario, Canada on January 1, 2008, using linked electronic medical record and administrative health data from the CANHEART (Cardiovascular Health in Ambulatory Care Research Team) cohort. Walkability was assessed using a validated index based on population and residential density, street connectivity, and the number of walkable destinations in each neighborhood, divided into quintiles (Q). The primary outcome was a predicted 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of ≥7.% (recommended threshold for statin use) assessed by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Pooled Cohort Equation. Adjusted associations were estimated using logistic regression models. Secondary outcomes included measured systolic blood pressure, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, prior diabetes mellitus diagnosis, and current smoking status. In total, 44 448 individuals were included in our analyses. Fully adjusted analyses found a nonlinear relationship between walkability and predicted 10-year cardiovascular disease risk (least [Q1] versus most [Q5] walkable neighborhood: odds ratio =1.09, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.22), with the greatest difference between Q3 and Q5 (odds ratio=1.33, 95% CI: 1.23, 1.45). Dose-response associations were observed for systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and diabetes mellitus risk, while an inverse association was observed with smoking status. Conclusions In our setting, adults living in less walkable neighborhoods had a higher predicted 10-year cardiovascular disease risk than those living in highly walkable areas.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667614>Impact of age on morbidity and mortality following bariatric surgery.</a></h1><p>Bariatric surgery is the most effective modality to treat  and -related comorbidities. This study sought to utilize the MBASQIP® Data Registry to analyze the impact of age at time of surgery on outcomes following sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) procedures.The MBSAQIP® Data Registry for patients undergoing SG or RYGB procedures between 2015 and 2016 was reviewed. Patients were divided into 4 age groups [18-44; 45-54; 55-64; > 65 years]. Minimal exclusions for revisional and/or emergency surgery were selected and combination variables created to classify complications as major or minor. A comorbidity index was constructed to include diabetes, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and prior cardiac surgery. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to compare age stratifications to the young adult (18-45 years) cohort.Of 301,605 cases, 279,419 cases (71.2% SG) remained after applying exclusion criteria (79.2% female, mean BMI 45. ± 8.1 kg/m, 8.9% insulin-dependent diabetics). Mean age was 44.7 ± 12.0 years (51.3% 18-44 years; 26.9% 45-54 years; 16.3% 55-64 years; .% > 65 years). A univariate analysis demonstrated preoperative differences of lower BMI with increasing age concomitant with increasing frequency of RYGB and a higher comorbidity index (p < 0.0001 vs. 18-45 years). At age > 45 years, major complications and 30-day mortality increased independent of procedure type (p < 0.0001). A multivariate analysis controlling for comorbidity indices demonstrated increasing age (> 45 years) increased risk for major complications and mortality.Overall, bariatric surgery (SG or RYGB) remains a low mortality risk procedure for all age groups. However, all age group classifications > 45 years had higher incidence of major complications and mortality compared to patients 18-45 years (despite older individuals having lower preoperative BMI) indicating delaying surgery is detrimental.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657463>Isothiazolinones in cleaning products.

Malnutrition and  have both been associated with reduced survival and increased drug toxicity. We investigated trends in the age- and sex-adjusted body mass index (ISO-BMI) and the prevalence of malnutrition in a Finnish cohort of 139 consecutive children receiving chemotherapy for cancer, with a follow-up period of 42 months after diagnosis. In total, 28% (39/139) of the patients experienced malnutrition (ISO-BMI < 17 or > 10% weight loss), and 12% (16/139) had a nasogastric tube or underwent gastrostomy. Patients with acute or chronic myeloid leukemia (/10), central nervous system (CNS) tumors (/13), or solid tumors (13/31) most frequently suffered from malnutrition. There was a significant increase in the ISO-BMI of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (+ 2.1 kg/m) and lymphomas (+ 2.4 kg/m) during the first 6 months, and the ISO-BMI of patients with ALL remained higher at 42 months compared to baseline (+ 1.9 kg/m).Conclusion: The cumulative incidence of malnutrition in Finnish pediatric cancer patients is comparable to that reported in other populations. The nutritional status of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, CNS tumors, or solid tumors should be monitored with extra care to facilitate early intervention in the case of impending malnutrition. What is known: • Both malnutrition and  are associated with reduced survival and increased drug toxicity in pediatric cancer patients. What is new: • Overall, 28 % of Finnish children receiving chemotherapy for cancer suffer from malnutrition during the first 42 months following the initial cancer diagnosis. • ISO-BMI curves from initial diagnosis to 42 months after diagnosis are provided for patients with different types of cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672146>Short-term treatment with high dose liraglutide improves lipid and lipoprotein profile and changes hormonal mediators of lipid metabolism in obese patients with no overt type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind clinical trial.</a></h1><p>Long-term treatment with up to 1.8 mg liraglutide improves cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is currently under investigation in subjects without diabetes. Aim of our study was to investigate whether high dose (3 mg) short-term ( weeks) treatment with liraglutide in obese patients with no overt type 2 diabetes affects metabolites, lipid and lipoprotein profile and components of activin-follistatin axis in cardiovascular beneficial or detrimental way.Twenty obese patients participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind study and were administrated liraglutide 3 mg or placebo for  weeks. Metabolites, fatty acids, lipid-lipoprotein profile and concentrations of activins and follistatins (250 parameters) were assessed in serum at start and completion of each treatment.Concentrations of important cardiovascular markers such as total, free and remnant cholesterol were reduced with liraglutide before and after adjusting for weight loss. Similarly, reductions in number of small and medium size LDL particles and in their total lipid concentration were observed with liraglutide and partially weight-loss related. Tyrosine levels were reduced and behenic acid levels were increased whereas only minor changes were observed in HDL, VLDL and IDL. Concentrations of activin AB and follistatin were significantly reduced in liraglutide-treated group.Treatment of obese patients without overt type 2 diabetes with high dose of liraglutide for a short period of time induces changes in lipid-lipoprotein and hormonal profile that are suggestive of lower risk of atherosclerosis and CVD.

This study compared the prevalence of a range of self-reported chronic conditions and utilisation of GP services and emergency department in a regional Victorian setting between two studies conducted in the same region in 2001-2003 and 2014.Repeat cross-sectional studies conducted over a decade apart.The projects were conducted in the Goulburn Valley in regional Victoria.The earlier study randomly selected households from local government lists. The later study randomly selected householders from the telephone directory.Participants were asked whether they had been diagnosed with a range of chronic health conditions and how often they had visited a general practitioner or emergency department in the past 12 months.The age-standardised prevalence of depression was higher in the 2014 study than the 2001-2003 study in men (increased by 8.0% (95% CI 4., 11.%)) and women (increased by 13.7% (95% CI 8.4, 19.0%)). Similarly, the prevalence of age-standardised diabetes and hypertension was higher in 2014 than 2001-2003 (men increased by 3.6% (95% CI 0.7, 6.% (diabetes)) and 13.6% (95% CI 8.6, 18.6% (hypertension)), women increased by 3.1% (95% CI 0.3, 6.% (diabetes)) and 8.4% (95% CI 2.3, 14.% (hypertension))).The results of this study indicate that the prevalence of self-reported depression, diabetes and hypertension has increased in this regional Victorian area over the past 13 years.

During this time, adult  grew by %.This study aimed to evaluate the demand and associated costs for hospital-based back surgery by geolocation over time to evaluate provider practice variation. The study then leveraged hierarchical time series to generate tight demand forecasts on an unobserved test set. Finally, explanatory financial, technical, workload, geographical, and temporal factors as well as state-level  rates were investigated as predictors for the demand for hospital-based back surgery.Hospital data from January 2012 to December 2017 were used to generate geospatial-temporal maps and a video of the Current Procedural Terminology codes beginning with the digit 63 claims. Hierarchical time series modeling provided forecasts for each state, the census regions, and the nation for an unobserved test set and then again for the out-years of 2018 and 2019. Stepwise regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, elastic net, and gradient-boosted random forests were built on a training set and evaluated on a test set to evaluate variables important to explaining the demand for hospital-based back surgery.Widespread, unexplained practice variation over time was seen using geographical information systems (GIS) multimedia mapping. Hierarchical time series provided accurate forecasts on a blind dataset and suggested a 6.52% (from 497,325 procedures in 2017 to 529,777 in 2018) growth of hospital-based back surgery in 2018 (529,777 and up to 13.00% by 2019 [from 497,325 procedures in 2017 to 563,023 procedures in 2019]). The increase in payments by 2019 are estimated to be US $323.9 million. Extreme gradient-boosted random forests beat constrained and unconstrained regression models on a 20% unobserved test set and suggested that  is one of the most important factors in explaining the increase in demand for hospital-based back surgery.Practice variation and  are factors to consider when estimating demand for hospital-based back surgery.
