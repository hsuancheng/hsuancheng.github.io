Eradication therapy using antibiotics is sometimes effective against gastrointestinal (GI) malignant lymphoma, suggesting that the tumor development or progression is affected by the inflammatory microenvironment. In the present study, serum samples from 148 patients with various subtypes of malignant lymphoma were tested for 11 proinflammatory Th1/Th2 cytokines. In the comparison by subtype or GI lesions, serum interleukin (IL)-8 (P = 6.-05), IL-4 (P = 7.-05), and IL-1β (P = 0.0043) levels showed significant differences among subtypes, being particularly elevated in follicular lymphomas (FL) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. Serum IL-8 levels were elevated in GI-FL and MALT lymphomas, and serum IL-4 and IL-1 β levels were elevated in MALT lymphomas. These findings show that GI low-grade B-cell lymphoma could develop against the background of an inflammatory microenvironment. Thus, these cytokines may be useful as diagnostic markers and could provide new insights into tumor development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26174627>Aberrant DNA methylation impacts gene expression and prognosis in breast cancer subtypes.</a></h1><p>DNA methylation has a substantial impact on gene expression, affecting the prognosis of breast cancer (BC) patients dependent on molecular subtypes. In this study, we investigated the prognostic relevance of the expression of genes reported as aberrantly methylated, and the link between gene expression and DNA methylation in BC subtypes. The prognostic value of the expression of 144 aberrantly methylated genes was evaluated in ER+/HER2-, HER2+, and ER-/HER2- molecular BC subtypes, in a meta-analysis of two large transcriptomic cohorts of BC patients (n = 1,938 and n = 1,640). The correlation between gene expression and DNA methylation in distinct gene regions was also investigated in an independent dataset of 104 BCs. Survival and Pearson correlation analyses were computed for each gene separately. The expression of 48 genes was significantly associated with BC prognosis (p < 0.05), and 32 of these prognostic genes exhibited a direct expression-methylation correlation. The expression of several immune-related genes, including CD3D and HLA-A, was associated with both relapse-free survival (HR = 0.42, p = 3.-06; HR = 0.35, p = 1.-08) and overall survival (HR = 0.50, p = .-04; HR = 0.68, p = 4.-02) in ER-/HER2- BCs. On the overall, the distribution of both positive and negative expression-methylation correlation in distinct gene regions have different effects on gene expression and prognosis in BC subtypes. This large-scale meta-analysis allowed the identification of several genes consistently associated with prognosis, whose DNA methylation could represent a promising biomarker for prognostication and clinical stratification of patients with distinct BC subtypes.© 2015 UICC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25469663>Lutein derived fragments exhibit higher antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties than lutein in lipopolysaccharide induced  in rats.</a></h1><p>In the present study, we appraise the anti-inflammatory efficacy of lutein oxidative degradation derivatives mediated through UV-irradiation over lutein in counteracting the  induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats (n =  per group). UV-irradiated lutein fragments were identified as anhydrolutein (B, C40H54O), 2,6,6-trimethylcyclohexa-1,4-dienylium (M1, C9H13), (2E,4E,6E,8E)-9-(4-hydroxy-2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-1en-1-yl)-3,7-dimethylnona-2,4,6,8-tetraen-1-ylium (M2, C20H29O), 4-[(1E,3E,,)-3,7,-dimethyldeca-1,3,,7-tetraen-1-yl]-3,,-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-ol (M3, C21H30O) and zeaxanthin (M4, C40H56O) and its isomers as 13'-Z zeaxanthin, 13'-Z lutein, all-trans zeaxanthin, and 9-Z lutein. Induction of  by LPS significantly increased the production of nitrites (3.3 fold in the serum and 2.6 fold in the liver), prostaglandin E2 (26 fold in the serum), and pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-α (6.6 fold in the serum), and interleukin-6 (4.8 fold in the serum). Oxidative derivatives of lutein, especially M1, M2 and M3, ameliorated acute  in rats by inhibiting the production of nitrites, malondialdehyde (MDA), PGE2, TNF-α, and IL-6 cytokines more efficiently than lutein in rats. The anti-inflammatory mechanism of derivatives might be related to the decrease of inflammatory cytokines and the increase of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S transferase, glutathione reductase), which would result in the reduction of iNOS, COX-2 and MDA and subsequently inflammatory responses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28770304>Effects of concentration of corn distillers dried grains with solubles and enzyme supplementation on cecal microbiota and performance in broiler chickens.</a></h1><p>With the increasing production of ethanol for biofuels, a by-product of corn-based ethanol fermentation, dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) is finding its way into the feed of agricultural animals including cattle, pigs, poultry, sheep, goats, aquaculture species and horses. Corn DDGS contains very high levels of non-starch polysaccharides and could be considered a good source of fibre. Despite knowledge of the role of the fibre in modulating intestinal microbiota and consequently influencing health, there is currently little information on the interactions between DDGS and intestinal microbiota. We assessed the changes in the cecal microbiota of broilers feed rations supplemented with DDGS (five concentrations: 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24% w/w) with and without presence of digestive enzymes. DDGS concentration was strongly positively correlated (P = 3., r = 0.74) with feed conversion efficiency (FCR), diminishing broiler performance with higher concentrations. Additionally, DDGS concentrations positively correlated with Richness index (P = 1., r = 0.), increasing the number of detectable species in the cecum. Among the most affected genera, Faecalibacterium (P = 0.032, r = -0.34) and Streptococcus (P = 7.9e, r = -0.39) were negatively correlated with DDGS, while Turicibacter (P = 2.8e, r = 0.52) was positively correlated with the DDGS concentration. Enzymes showed minimal effect on cecal microbiota.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25420175>Injury-induced biosynthesis of methyl-branched polyene pigments in a white-rotting basidiomycete.</a></h1><p>A stereaceous basidiomycete was investigated with regard to its capacity to produce yellow pigments after physical injury of the mycelium. Two pigments were isolated from mycelial extracts, and their structures were elucidated by ESIMS and one- and two-dimensional NMR methods. The structures were identified as the previously undescribed polyenes (3Z,,,9E,11E,13Z,15E,17E)-18-methyl-19-oxoicosa-3,,7,9,11,13,15,17-octaenoic acid (1) and (3E,5Z,,9E,11E,13E,15Z,17E,19E)-20-methyl-21-oxodocosa-3,,7,9,11,13,15,17,19-nonaenoic acid (2). Stable-isotope feeding with [1-(13)C]acetate and l-[methyl-(13)C]methionine demonstrated a polyketide backbone and that the introduction of the sole methyl branch is most likely S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent. Dose-dependent inhibition of Drosophila melanogaster larval development was observed with both polyenes in concentrations between 12. and 100 μM. GI50 values for 1 and 2 against HUVEC (K-562 cells) were 71.6 and 17.4 μM (15.4 and 1.1 μM), respectively, whereas CC50 values for HeLa cells were virtually identical (44.1 and 45.1 μM).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25672844>Biosynthesis and genomic analysis of medium-chain hydrocarbon production by the endophytic fungal isolate Nigrograna mackinnonii E5202H.</a></h1><p>An endophytic fungus was isolated that produces a series of volatile natural products, including terpenes and odd chain polyenes. Phylogenetic analysis of the isolate using five loci suggests that it is closely related to Nigrograna mackinnonii CBS 674.75. The main component of the polyene series was purified and identified as (3E,,)-nona-1,3,,7-tetraene (NTE), a novel natural product. Non-oxygenated hydrocarbons of this chain length are uncommon and desirable as gasoline-surrogate biofuels. The biosynthetic pathway for NTE production was explored using metabolic labeling and gas chromatography time of flight mass spectometer (GCMS). Two-carbon incorporation (13)C acetate suggests that it is derived from a polyketide synthase (PKS) followed by decarboxylation. There are several known mechanisms for such decarboxylation, though none have been discovered in fungi. Towards identifying the PKS responsible for the production of NTE, the genome of N. mackinnonii E5202H (ATCC SD-6839) was sequenced and assembled. Of the 32 PKSs present in the genome, 17 are predicted to contain sufficient domains for the production of NTE. These results exemplify the capacity of endophytic fungi to produce novel natural products that may have many uses, such as biologically derived fuels and commodity chemicals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28466299>Streptomyces sp. AT37 isolated from a Saharan soil produces a furanone derivative active against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.</a></h1><p>A novel actinobacterium strain, named AT37, showed a strong activity against some multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus MRSA ATCC 43300, other clinical isolates of MRSA and vancomycin resistant S. aureus VRSA S1. The strain AT37 was isolated from a Saharan soil by a dilution agar plating method using chitin-vitamin agar medium supplemented with rifampicin. The morphological and chemical studies indicated that this strain belonged to the genus Streptomyces. Its 16S rRNA gene sequence was determined and a database search indicated that it was closely associated with the type strain of Streptomyces novaecaesareae NBRC 13368 with 99.6% of similarity. However, the comparison of the morphological and the physiological characteristics of the strain with those of the nearest species showed significant differences. The strain AT37 secreted the antibiotic optimally during mid-stationary phase of growth. One active compound (AT37-1) was extracted from the culture broth with dichloromethane, separated on silica gel plates and purified by HPLC. Based on spectroscopic analysis of UV-Visible, infrared, and H and C NMR spectra and spectrometric analysis, the chemical structure of the compound AT37-1 was identified as -[(,,11E)-2,10-dihydroxy-9,11-dimethyl-,7,11-tridecatrien-1-yl]-2-hydroxy-2-(1-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl-3(2H)-furanone. Minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC) of this compound showed significant activity against multidrug-resistant S. aureus with 15-30 and 10-15 μg/mL, respectively.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28640741>An endophytic Fusarium sp. isolated from Monarda citriodora produces the industrially important plant-like volatile organic compound hexanal.</a></h1><p>An endophytic fungus, MC_25L, has been isolated from the leaves of MonardacitriodoraCerv. ex Lag., a medicinal and aromatic herb from the northwestern Himalayas. It produces a fruity fragrance while growing on potato dextrose agar, suggesting that it is producing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The endophyte inhibited the growth of plant pathogens such asSclerotiniasp. and Aspergillusflavus by virtue of VOCs. Identification of MC_25L based on morphological and microscopic features, as well as ITS-based rDNA sequence analysis, revealed that it is a Fusariumsp. GC-MS analysis revealed that this endophyte produces a unique array of VOCs, in particular hexanal, p-fluoroanisole, pentafluoropropionic acid 2-ethylhexyl, ()--ethyl-2-methyl--hepten-3-one, 2-butyl-2-hexanol, ()-2-methyl-7-hexadecene and acoradiene. Three major compounds were hexanal, ()--ethyl-2-methyl--hepten-3-one and acoradiene, and they account for around 84.57 % of the total VOCs. Moreover, of interest was the presence of hexanal, which has applications in the food and cosmetic industries, as well as in mycofumigation. This is the first report of a fungal endophyte producing the industrially important plant-like VOC hexanal. Hexanal is also active biologically. Thus this study indicates that Fusariumsp. (MC_25L) is a potential candidate for the up-scaling of hexanal.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30368728>Hypermethylated Promoters of Secreted Frizzled-Related Protein Genes are Associated with Colorectal Cancer.</a></h1><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Aberrant DNA methylation has been recognized as one of the most common molecular alterations in CRC. The goal of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value of SFRP1 and SFRP2 methylation for CRC. A total of 80 pairs of CRC patients were recruited to test the association of SFRP1 and SFRP2 promotor methylation with CRC. Methylation assay was performed using quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (qMSP) method. In this study, we found the methylation levels of SFRP1 and SFRP2 in CRC tumor tissues were significantly higher than those in the adjacent non-tumor tissues (SFRP1: P = 2E-; SFRP2: P = 0.014). Further bioinformatics analysis of TCGA data confirmed the association of the two genes with CRC (SFRP1: P = -21; SFRP2: P = -24). Luciferase reporter gene assay showed that the recombinant plasmids with SFRP1 and SFRP2 fragments could significantly enhance promoter activity (SFRP1: P = 0.002; SFRP2: P = 0.004). In addition, SFRP1 and SFRP2 methylation were inversely correlated with the mRNA expression displayed by TCGA data mining (SFRP1: r = -0.432, P = 4E-11; SFRP2: r = -0.478, P = 1E-13). GEO data analysis indicated that SFRP1 and SFRP2 expression were increased in three CRC cell lines (COLO320, HCT116 and HT29) after '-AZA-deoxycytidine treatment, suggesting that DNA methylation played an important role in regulating gene expression of the two genes. Our results confirmed that promoter methylation of SFRP1 and SFRP2 contributed to the risk of CRC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27384994>Cross-validation of survival associated biomarkers in gastric cancer using transcriptomic data of 1,065 patients.</a></h1><p>Multiple gene expression based prognostic biomarkers have been repeatedly identified in gastric carcinoma. However, without confirmation in an independent validation study, their clinical utility is limited. Our goal was to establish a robust database enabling the swift validation of previous and future gastric cancer survival biomarker candidates.The entire database incorporates 1,065 gastric carcinoma samples, gene expression data. Out of 29 established markers, higher expression of BECN1 (HR = 0.68, p = 1.-05), CASP3 (HR = 0., p = 6E-14), COX2 (HR = 0.72, p = 0.0013), CTGF (HR = 0.72, p = 0.00051), CTNNB1 (HR = 0.47, p = 4.3E-15), MET (HR = 0.63, p = 1.3E-05), and SIRT1 (HR = 0.64, p = 2.2E-07) correlated to longer OS. Higher expression of BIRC5 (HR = 1.45, p = 1E-04), CNTN1 (HR = 1.44, p = 3.- 05), EGFR (HR = 1.86, p = 8.-11), ERCC1 (HR = 1.36, p = 0.0012), HER2 (HR = 1.41, p = 0.00011), MMP2 (HR = 1.78, p = 2.6E-09), PFKB4 (HR = 1.56, p = 3.2E-07), SPHK1 (HR = 1.61, p = 3.1E-06), SP1 (HR = 1.45, p = 1.6E-05), TIMP1 (HR = 1.92, p = 2.2E- 10) and VEGF (HR = 1.53, p = .-06) were predictive for poor OS.We integrated samples of three major cancer research centers (Berlin, Bethesda and Melbourne datasets) and publicly available datasets with available follow-up data to form a single integrated database. Subsequently, we performed a literature search for prognostic markers in gastric carcinomas (PubMed, 2012-2015) and re-validated their findings predicting first progression (FP) and overall survival (OS) using uni- and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.The major advantage of our analysis is that we evaluated all genes in the same set of patients thereby making direct comparison of the markers feasible. The best performing genes include BIRC5, CASP3, CTNNB1, TIMP-1, MMP-2, SIRT, and VEGF.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25027330>Whole-exome imputation of sequence variants identified two novel alleles associated with adult body height in African Americans.</a></h1><p>Adult body height is a quantitative trait for which genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous loci, primarily in European populations. These loci, comprising common variants, explain <10% of the phenotypic variance in height. We searched for novel associations between height and common (minor allele frequency, MAF ≥%) or infrequent (0.% < MAF < %) variants across the exome in African Americans. Using a reference panel of 1692 African Americans and 471 Europeans from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI) Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), we imputed whole-exome sequence data into 13 719 African Americans with existing array-based GWAS data (discovery). Variants achieving a height-association threshold of P < -06 in the imputed dataset were followed up in an independent sample of 1989 African Americans with whole-exome sequence data (replication). We used P < 2.-07 (=0.05/196 779 variants) to define statistically significant associations in meta-analyses combining the discovery and replication sets (N = 15 708). We discovered and replicated three independent loci for association: 5p13.3/C5orf22/rs17410035 (MAF = 0.10, β = 0.64 cm, P = 8.3E-08), 13q14.2/SPRYD7/rs114089985 (MAF = 0.03, β = 1.46 cm, P = 4.8E-10) and 17q23.3/GH2/rs2006123 (MAF = 0.30; β = 0.47 cm; P = 4.-09). Conditional analyses suggested 5p13.3 (C5orf22/rs17410035) and 13q14.2 (SPRYD7/rs114089985) may harbor novel height alleles independent of previous GWAS-identified variants (r(2) with GWAS loci <0.01); whereas 17q23.3/GH2/rs2006123 was correlated with GWAS-identified variants in European and African populations. Notably, 13q14.2/rs114089985 is infrequent in African Americans (MAF = 3%), extremely rare in European Americans (MAF = 0.03%), and monomorphic in Asian populations, suggesting it may be an African-American-specific height allele. Our findings demonstrate that whole-exome imputation of sequence variants can identify low-frequency variants and discover novel variants in non-European populations.© The Author 2014.
