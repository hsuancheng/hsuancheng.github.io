In confluent keratinocyte cultures "wounded" with a razor blade, the VIP-treated samples disclosed a more rapid migration from the wound margins into the wound bed, starting within the first 4 h. Almost 80% of the wounded area was covered within 24 h. In contrast, VIP-derivatives were not significantly different from controls, covering 10 to 18% of the wounded area (p < 0.02).  has been assessed with an artificial non-toxic polyurethane matrix. In controls, we were able to observe migration of keratinocytes on the matrix within the first 24 h. The cells, however, were not able to migrate further and to survive. After 48 h, VIP-treated cultures showed a complete  of the matrix by keratinocytes vs. less than 10% of the total area in controls (p < 0.001). The induction of migration and of  was VIP-dose-dependent. The data indicate that induced migration is stimulated by VIP, when the N-terminal ending is intact, but loss of the C-terminus abrogates both migration and . Our investigations have implications for wound healing but also for bioengineering of skin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7758002>The laminin alpha 1 chain Ile--Val-Ala-Val (IKVAV)-containing peptide promotes liver  by human colon cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Laminin, a major basement membrane-specific glycoprotein, promotes the attachment, migration, and invasion of a variety of tumor cells. Since laminin is present in the perisinusoidal matrix of the liver, we studied its effects on liver  by human colon cancer cells (HM7, LiM6) previously shown to have liver-metastasizing ability in athymic mice. These malignant cells expressed high levels of a 32-kDa laminin-binding protein on Western blot analysis when compared to the low metastatic parental cell line. Coinjection of laminin alpha chain-derived peptides which contain the amino acid sequence Ile--Val-Ala-Val (IKVAV) significantly stimulated liver  as determined by liver weight (P < 0.005) and number of tumor nodules (P < 0.02) 3 weeks after splenic-portal inoculation into nude mice. No stimulation was seen with a control peptide containing the same amino acids but in a scrambled sequence. In contrast, the -Ile-Gly-Ser-Arg peptide from the laminin beta 1 chain significantly inhibited HM7 liver . These differences were not due to alterations in the number of cells initially reaching the liver as determined by injection of [125I]iododeoxyuridine-labeled tumor cells, but retention in the liver was stimulated by the IKVAV-containing peptides. Flow analysis indicated that the IKVAV peptide may act, in part, by stimulating homotypic adhesion of tumor cells. These data suggest that interactions of colon cancer cells with the IKVAV site on laminin may play a role in the formation of metastatic foci in the liver through cell-cell or cell-substratum interactions which promote metastasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9921265>[Identification of biologically active sites in laminin an extracellular matrix protein].</a></h2><p>Laminin-1, a major component of basement membranes, has multiple biological activities including promotion of cell adhesion, spreading, migration, growth, neurite outgrowth and tumor metastasis. Several active sites on laminin-1 have been identified previously. We modified these biologically active peptides to enhance their activities. The multimeric YIGSR (-Ile-Gly-Ser-Arg) peptides assembled on a branched lysine core were found to strongly enhance the activity of YIGSR in inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. We also found the all-D-configuration peptide segment containing the IKVAV (Ile--Val-Ala-Val) sequence had similar biological activities to the native all-L-peptide in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that these modified compounds are potentially useful for clinical applications. We have identified new active sequences from the laminin alpha 1 chain carboxyl-terminal globular domain (G domain). Using a systematic screening for cell binding sites with 113 overlapping synthetic peptides, we found five peptides (AG-10, AG-22, AG-32, AG-56, and AG-73) showed cell attachment activities with cell-type specificities. AG-10 and AG-32 were found to interact with integrins. AG-73 caused metastases of B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells to the liver  in mice. Additionally AG-73 was found to promote neurite outgrowth. Moreover, this peptide inhibited laminin mediated acinar-like development of a human submandibular gland cell line. The AG-73 domain on laminin-1 could be one of the most important biologically active sites. These active peptides may useful for study of the molecular mechanism of laminin-receptor interactions and for development of therapeutic reagents for tumor metastasis and angiogenasis.</p></html>
