We analyzed effects of body weight (BW) and gestational period on nutrient composition in fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs. Fetuses with the lowest BW (LBW), middle BW (MBW), and highest BW (HBW) were collected at days 45, 75, and 110 of gestation. Crude protein (CP), crude , amino acid (AA), and fatty acid (FA) concentrations were determined. The BW gain, carcass weight,  percentage, and uterus weight of sows increased as gestation progressed, as did litter weight, average individual fetal weight, fetal body weight, and dry matter (DM). The concentrations of Ala, Arg, crude , Gly, Pro, , C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:1n9c, C18:2n6c, C18:3n3, C18:3n6, C20:0, C20:3n6, saturated FA (SFA), and monounsaturated FA (MUFA) increased significantly as gestation progressed. The percentage of skeleton, and the ratio of the liver, lung, and stomach to BW decreased as gestation progressed. There were also significant reductions in the concentrations of CP, Asp, Glu, His, , Leu, Lys, Phe, Ser, Thr, essential AA (EAA), acidic AA, C17:0, C20:4n6, C22:6n3, unsaturated FA (UFA), polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), n-3PUFA, n-6PUFA as gestation progressed, and reductions in EAA/total AA (TAA), PUFA/SFA, and n-3/n-6 PUFA. The LBW fetuses exhibited the lowest BW and crude , C14:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:2n6c, and MUFA concentrations at days 75 and 110 of gestation. They also exhibited lower  concentration at day 45 of gestation and lower Glu concentration at day 75 of gestation than HBW fetuses. These findings suggest that LBW fetuses exhibit lower amounts of crude  and several FAs during mid-gestation and late-gestation, which may in turn affect adaptability, growth, and development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29037407>Serum concentrations of free amino acids in growing pigs exposed to diurnal heat stress fluctuations.</a></h1><p>In areas where the ambient temperature (AT) is above the thermo neutral (TN) zone of pigs, significant changes within a 24-h period occur, differently affecting the availability of amino acids (AA) within the same day. An experiment was conducted to analyze the serum concentrations (SC) of free AA in pigs exposed to diurnal variations in AT. Six pigs (27.1 ±1.3kg ) implanted with a thermometer to register the  temperature (BT) at 15-min intervals were used. Blood samples were collected on the last 3 d of the 14-d study, at 0700h (lowest AT), 1200h (mild HS), and 1600h (severe HS). The pigs received 1.2kg/d of an AA-supplemented, wheat-soybean meal diet, in two equal meals (0700 and 1900h). The AT and BT, recorded at 0700, 1200, and 1600h was: 30.6, 38.6, 41.1°C, and 38.2, 39.5, 40.3°C, respectively. The BT was significantly correlated (P < 0.001) with the AT. The SC (μM/mL) of , Lys, Met, Val, Ala, Asn, and Pro were higher (P ≤ 0.01); Arg, Phe, Glu, and  tended to be higher (P ≤ 0.10); but Cys was lower (P < 0.05) at 1200h than at 0700h. Lys was higher, Cys and  were lower (P < 0.05), and  and Val tended to be higher (P ≤ 0.10) at 1600h than at 0700h. Serum Arg, , Phe, Ala, Asn, Gln, Pro, Ser, and  were lower (P < 0.05), and Leu and Val tended to be lower at 1600h than at 1200h. These data demonstrate that AT directly alters the BT of pigs, and that diurnal variations in AT differently affect their SC and availability of AA for growth.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Zn(2+) binding to OT is known to increase the affinity of OT for its receptor [Pearlmutter, A. F., Soloff, M. S.: Characterization of the metal ion requirement for oxytocin-receptor interaction in rat mammary gland membranes. J. Biol. Chem. 254, 3899-3906 (1979)]. In the absence of Zn(2+), we find evidence for two primary OT conformations, which arise because the Cys(6)-Pro(7) peptide bond exists in both the trans- and cis-configurations. Upon addition of Zn(2+), we determine binding constants in water of KA = 1.43 ± 0.24 and 0.42 ± 0.12 μM(-1), for the trans- and cis-configured populations, respectively. The Zn(2+) bound form of OT, having a cross section of Ω = 235 Å(2), has Pro(7) in the trans-configuration, which agrees with a prior report [Wyttenbach, T., Liu, D., Bowers, M. T.: Interactions of the hormone oxytocin with divalent metal ions. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 130, 5993-6000 (2008)], in which it was proposed that Zn(2+) binds to the peptide ring and is further coordinated by interaction of the C-terminal, Pro(7)-Leu(8)-Gly(9)-NH2, tail. The present work shows that the cis-configuration of OT isomerizes to the trans-configuration upon binding Zn(2+). In this way, the proline residue regulates Zn(2+) binding to OT and, hence, is important in receptor binding.

Hydrolysates with strong ACE-inhibitory effects were generated from stone fish protein under the optimum conditions of hydrolysis using bromelain and fractionated based on hydrophobicity and isoelectric properties of the constituent peptides. Five novel peptide sequences with molecular  (mw) < 1000 daltons (Da) were identified using LC-MS/MS. The peptides including Ala-Leu-Gly-Pro-Gln-Phe- (794.44 Da), Lys-Val-Pro-Pro-Lys-Ala (638.88 Da), Leu-Ala-Pro-Pro-Thr-Met (628.85 Da), Glu-Val-Leu--Gln (600.77 Da) and Glu-His-Pro-Val-Leu (593.74 Da) were evaluated for ACE-inhibitory activity and showed IC50 values of 0.012 mM, 0.980 mM, 1.310 mM, 1.440 mM and 1.680 mM, respectively. The ACE-inhibitory effects of the peptides were further verified using molecular docking study. The docking results demonstrated that the peptides exhibit their effect mainly via hydrogen and electrostatic bond interactions with ACE. These findings provide evidence about stone fish as a valuable source of raw materials for the manufacture of antihypertensive peptides that can be incorporated to enhance therapeutic relevance and commercial significance of formulated functional foods.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26290731>Effect of different soybean meal type on ileal digestibility of amino acid in weaning pigs.</a></h1><p>An experiment was conducted to evaluate apparent (AID) and standardized (SID) ileal digestibilities of crude protein (CP) and amino acids (AA) with 6 soybean products in weaning pigs. A total of 14 weaning barrows with an initial  of 6.54 ± 0.34 kg were fitted with T-cannula at the distal ileum and allotted to 7 diets containing various soybean products. The soybean products used in the experiment were conventional soybean meal (CSBM), SBM fermented by Aspergillus oryzae GB-107 (FSBMA), SBM fermented by Bacillus subtilis PP6 (FSBMB), UV sterilized SBM fermented by Bacillus subtilis PP6 (UVFSBMB), SBM containing Bacillus subtilis PP6 (PSBM), and soy protein concentrate (SPC). Six corn-based diets were used and each of soybean products was added. All diets contained 5.0 g/kg of chromic oxide as an indigestible indicator and an N-free diet was used to measure basal endogenous losses of CP and AAs. Ileal CP digestibility did not differ by different soybean products. However, SIDs of , Phe and Val were improved in pigs fed the FSBMB, UVFSBMB and SPC diets and the pigs fed the FSBMA diet showed higher SIDs of Phe and Val compared with those fed the CSBM diet (P < 0.05). The FSBMB diet had higher SIDs in most AAs compared with the FSBMA diet (P < 0.05), and higher SIDs of Lys, Ala, Pro, Ser, and  compared with PSBM diet (P < 0.05). However, there was no response of UV-sterilization on the FSBMB in the SIDs of AAs. These results suggest that SIDs of AAs could be improved by the supplementation of fermented soybean products in the diet for weaning pigs but fermentation with Bacillus subtilis is more efficient in improving ileal AA digestibility than that with Aspergillus oryzae. Furthermore, probiotics supplementation in the CSBM and UV-sterilization of the FSBMB had no effects on chemical composition and ileal AA digestibility.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27239477>Isolation and Characterization of a Broad Spectrum Bacteriocin from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens RX7.</a></h1><p>We isolated a Bacillus strain, RX7, with inhibitory activity against Listeria monocytogenes from soil and identified it as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The inhibitory activity was stable over a wide range of pH and was fully retained after 30 min at 80°C, after which it decreased gradually at higher temperatures. The activity was sensitive to the proteolytic action of α-chymotrypsin, proteinase-K, and trypsin, indicating its proteinaceous nature. This bacteriocin was active against a broad spectrum of bacteria and the fungus Candida albicans. Direct detection of antimicrobial activity on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel suggested an apparent molecular mass of approximately 5 kDa. Ammonium sulfate precipitation and anion-exchange and gel permeation chromatography integrated with reverse phase-high-performance liquid chromatography were used for bacteriocin purification. Automated N-terminal Edman degradation of the purified RX7 bacteriocin recognized the first 15 amino acids as NH2-X-Ala-Trp--Asp--Arg-Lys-Leu-Gly-Asn-Lys-Gly-Ala, where the letter X in the sequence indicates an unknown or nonstandard amino acid. Based on BLAST similarity search and multiple alignment analysis, the obtained partial sequence showed high homology with the two-peptide lantibiotic haloduracin (HalA1) from Bacillus halodurans, although at least two amino acids differed between the sequences. A time-kill study demonstrated a bactericidal mode of action of RX7 bacteriocin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30781926>Complete Covalent Structure of Human Platelet Factor 4.</a></h1><p>The amino acid sequence of the subunit of human platelet factor 4 has been determined.

Experiment 1 was conducted to validate a dietary formulation approach in which broilers were fed 1 of 5 diets including a 19.0% CP corn-soybean meal based (CSBM) diet, a LCP control diet (16.7% CP) that matched the AA profile of the CSBM diet, and 3 LCP diets with 30% reductions in standardized ileal digestible concentrations of TSAA, Lys, or Thr from 14 to 23 d post-hatch.  gain and G:F were greatest (P < 0.05) and similar for broilers fed the CSBM and LCP control diets, whereas reductions in Thr, TSAA, and Lys each decreased (P < 0.05) G:F of broilers. In Experiment 2, birds were allotted to 18 treatment groups in a factorial arrangement of 9 dietary treatments × 2 infection states. Dietary treatments included a LCP control diet similar to that fed in Experiment 1 and 8 LCP diets with 40% individual reductions in TSAA, Lys, Thr, Val, , Arg, Phe + , or Gly + Ser. Broilers received experimental diets from 10 d to 28 d post-hatch and were inoculated with 0 or 4.0 × 10 sporulated E. acervulina oocysts at 15 d. Decreased (P < 0.05) growth performance (10 to 28 d) of broilers was observed with each AA reduction, except Phe + , compared with birds fed the LCP control diet.  gain and G:F were lowest (P < 0.05) for birds fed diets reduced in Lys or Val. Eimeria acervulina decreased growth performance and plasma carotenoids of broilers, but effects varied among dietary treatment groups as indicated by diet × infection interactions (P < 0.05). Dietary AA reductions did not alter (P > 0.05) the increase in intestinal gene expression of interferon-γ, interleukin-1β, or interleukin-10 observed in E. acervulina-infected birds.© 2016 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29879834>Effect of keratinase on ileal amino acid digestibility in five feedstuffs fed to growing pigs.</a></h1><p>This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of keratinase (KE) on the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of amino acids (AA) in rice bran, cottonseed meal (CSM), rapeseed meal (RSM), corn distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), and peanut meal (PNM).Twelve crossbred barrows (Duroc×Landrace×Yorkshire, 50.5±1.4 kg body weight [BW]) fitted with T-cannulas at the terminal ileum were allotted to a 12×6 Youden Square design with 12 diets and 6 periods. The treatment diets included rice bran, CSM, RSM, corn DDGS, PNM, or corn-soybean meal (cSBM) supplemented with 0.05% KE or not. Diets were given to pigs at a level of 3% BW in two equal meals. The endogenous AA losses were the mean results of three previously experiments determined by a same nitrogen-free diet fed to pigs. Pigs had free access to water during the experiment.The KE supplementation improved (p<0.05) the AID and SID of Met, Thr, Val, Asp, Cys, and  in rice bran. Inclusion of KE increased (p<0.05) the AID and SID of Met and Val in CSM. The KE supplementation decreased (p<0.05) the AID and SID of His in RSM and all measured AA except for Arg, Met, Trp, Val, Gly, and Pro in corn DDGS. There was an increase (p<0.05) in AID and SID of Leu, , Met, Ala, Cys, Ser, and  in PNM supplemented with KE compared with that without KE. Inclusion of KE increased (p<0.05) the AID and SID of crude protein, Leu, , Phe, Thr, Asp, and Ser in cSBM.This study indicated that KE had different effects on ileal AA digestibility of feedstuffs for growing pigs, which can give some usage directions of KE in swine feed containing those detected feedstuffs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27537897>Anticancer Activity of a Hexapeptide from Skate (Raja porosa) Cartilage Protein Hydrolysate in HeLa Cells.</a></h1><p>In this study, the hexapeptide Phe--Met-Gly-Pro- (FIMGPY), which has a molecular weight of 726.9 Da, was separated from skate (Raja porosa) cartilage protein hydrolysate using ultrafiltration and chromatographic methods, and its anticancer activity was evaluated in HeLa cells. Methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay indicated that FIMGPY exhibited high, dose-dependent anti-proliferation activities in HeLa cells with an IC50 of 4.81 mg/mL. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) fluorescence staining and flow cytometry methods confirmed that FIMGPY could inhibit HeLa cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis. Western blot assay revealed that the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and relative intensity of caspase-3 in HeLa cells treated with 7-mg/mL FIMGPY were 2.63 and 1.83, respectively, significantly higher than those of the blank control (p < 0.01). Thus, FIMGPY could induce apoptosis by upregulating the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 activation. Using a DNA ladder method further confirmed that the anti-proliferation activity of FIMGPY was attributable to its role in inducing apoptosis. These results suggest that FIMGPY from skate cartilage protein hydrolysate may have applications as functional foods and nutraceuticals for the treatment and prevention of cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27018713>Effects of Alpha-Ketoglutarate on Glutamine Metabolism in Piglet Enterocytes in Vivo and in Vitro.</a></h1><p>Alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) plays a vital part in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and is a key intermediate in the oxidation of L-glutamine (Gln). The study was to evaluate effects of AKG on Gln metabolism in vivo and in vitro. A total of twenty-one piglets were weaned at 28 days with a mean  (BW) of 6.0 ± 0.2 kg, and randomly divided into 3 groups: corn soybean meal based diet (CON group); the basal diet with 1% alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG treatment group); and the basal diet with 1% L-glutamine (GLN treatment group). Intestinal porcine epithelial cells-1 (IPEC-1) were incubated to investigate effects of 0.5, 2, and 3 mM AKG addition on Gln metabolism. Our results showed that there were no differences (P > 0.05) among the 3 treatments in initial BW, final BW, and average daily feed intake. However, average daily gain (P = 0.013) and gain:feed (P = 0.041) of the AKG group were greater than those of the other two groups. In comparison with the CON group, the AKG and GLN groups exhibited an improvement in villus length, mucosal thickness, and crypt depth in the jejunum of piglets. Serum concentrations of Asp, Glu, Val, , , Phe, Lys, and Arg in the piglets fed the 1% AKG or Gln diet were lower than those in the CON group. Compared with the CON group, the mRNA expression of jejunal and ileal amino acid (AA) transporters in the AKG and GLN groups were significantly increased (P < 0.05). Additionally, the in vitro study showed that the addition of 0.5, 2, and 3 mM AKG dose-dependently decreased (P < 0.05) the net utilization of Gln and formulation of ammonia, Glu, Ala, and Asp by IPEC-1. In conclusion, dietary AKG supplementation, as a replacement for Gln, could improve Gln metabolism in piglet enterocytes and enhance the utilization of AA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27862400>Optimal in-feed amino acid ratio for broiler breeder hens based on deletion studies.</a></h1><p>An ideal amino acid ratio (IAAR) for breeder hens is needed for maximum nitrogen retention (NR) taking into account nitrogen deposition in body (ND ), feathers (ND ) and egg mass (NEM) to improve dietary protein efficiency. Thus, the aim of this study was to apply the deletion method to derive the IAAR for broiler breeder hens. The nitrogen balance trials were performed from 31 to 35 weeks and from 46 to 50 weeks. Twelve treatments with eight replicates and one hen per cage were used. A balanced diet (BD) was formulated to meet the requirement of all nutrients. The other diets were formulated diluting 55% of BD with corn starch and refilled with amino acids (AAs) and other ingredients, except the AA tested. Each trial lasted 25 days. Feather losses, egg production and egg weight were recorded daily, and the samples were stored to further determine NEM and nitrogen in feather losses (ND ). At the start and the end of each period, a group of birds were slaughtered to further determine ND and ND . The NR was calculated as the sum of ND , ND , ND , NEM and the nitrogen maintenance requirement (NMR). The deletion of valine greatly depressed the NR in peak production (31 to 35 weeks) while the deletion of the isoleucine greatly depressed the NR of the hens from 46 to 50 weeks of age. The percentual reduction in NR and the per cent of the AA to delete from the BD were used to calculate the AA requirement. The average IAAR was Lys 100, Met+Cys 86, Trp 23, Thr 80, Arg 113, Val 90,  91, Leu 133, Phe+ 108, Gly+Ser 94 and His 35. The IAAR was in line with the recommendation from the literature, validating deletion method with the advantages from a rapid and low-cost procedure.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26506550>Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory peptides in commercial Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses of different ages.</a></h1><p>Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤ 6d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular  (MW) ≤ 3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, -Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg--Leu (VRYL), -Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro--Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

PSM protein was hydrolyzed using trypsin and fractionated by ultrafiltration. Molecular  fraction (<3 kDa) with the highest antioxidant activity was purified using prep-HPLC and analytical HPLC. The purification fold of the peptide (fraction V) obtained from PSM protein hydrolysate on DPPH radical scavenging activity, ABTS radical scavenging activity, and reducing power was 1.79-, 1.59-, and 1.81-fold, respectively, after the three-step purification procedure. The sequence of the purified peptide from fraction V that exhibited free radical scavenging activity and reducing power was identified as -Ser-Pro-Arg--Leu-Ser--Asn-Leu-Arg (1,330.77 Da).

Twenty boars (Yorkshire×Landrace) with average initial  of 35 (±2.6) kg were fitted with a simple T-cannula at the distal ileum. These pigs were offered six diets containing soybean meal (SBM), canola meal (CM) or corn distillers dried grains with solubles (corn-DDGS) that were either adequate (19%) or marginal (15%) in CP using a triplicated 6×2 Youden Square Design. Except for Met, Trp, Cys, and Pro, AID of AA was greater (p<0.05) in the SBM diet compared with the CM diet. Apparent ileal digestibility for Gly and Asp was greater (p<0.05) in the SBM diet compared with the corn-DDGS diet. The AID of , Leu, Phe, Val, Ala, , and Asp was greater (p<0.05) in the corn-DDGS diet compared with the CM diet. Standardized ileal digestibility of AA was greater (p<0.05) in the SBM diet compared with the CM diet for all AA except Trp and Pro. The SID of , Leu, Val, Ala, , and Asp was greater (p<0.05) in the corn-DDGS diet compared with the CM diet.

Ross 308 male broilers (400 total) were housed in battery cages from 1 to 21 d post-hatch and received common corn-soybean meal-based diets throughout the experiment. At 9 d post-hatch, birds were individually weighed and allotted to 4 treatment groups with 10 replicate cages of 10 birds per cage. At 15 d post-hatch, all birds were inoculated with 1 mL of distilled water that contained 0, 2.5 × 10(5), 5.0 × 10(5), or 1.0 × 10(6) sporulated E. acervulina oocysts. At 21 d, birds were euthanized for collection of blood and ileal digesta.  gain and feed efficiency decreased linearly (P < 0.05) with increasing E. acervulina dose. With the exception of Trp and Gly, AID values decreased (P < 0.05) linearly or quadratically for all amino acids by an average of 2.6 percentage units for birds inoculated with 1.0 × 10(6) oocysts compared with uninfected birds. Infection with E. acervulina caused a quadratic decrease (P < 0.05) in plasma carotenoid concentrations. Plasma concentrations of Arg and  decreased linearly (P < 0.05) with increasing E. acervulina inoculation dose and plasma Gln and Asn decreased quadratically (P < 0.01). Linear increases (P < 0.05) were observed for plasma Lys, Leu, , Val, Pro, and Orn as E. acervulina inoculation dose increased. Plasma α1-acid glycoprotein of broilers was not influenced (P > 0.05) by E. acervulina infection. In conclusion, E. acervulina challenge adversely impacted growth performance, plasma carotenoids, and AID of amino acids in a dose-dependent manner. However, plasma amino acid responses to graded E. acervulina inoculation doses varied considerably among amino acids. Thus, these results indicated that alterations in amino acid metabolism caused by E. acervulina infection extended beyond reduced amino acid digestibility.© 2016 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959521>Meta-regression analysis to predict the influence of branched-chain and large neutral amino acids on growth performance of pigs1.</a></h1><p>A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), their interactions, and interactions with large neutral amino acids (LNAA) to develop prediction equations for growth performance of pigs.

The predictor variables tested included average  (BW), crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, :Lys, Leu:Lys, Val:Lys, BCAA:Lys, :Leu, Val:Leu, :Val, (+Val):Leu, Trp:Lys, Leu:Trp, :Trp, Val:Trp, BCAA:Trp, Met:Lys, Leu:Met, :Met, Val:Met, BCAA:Met, His:Lys, Leu:His, :His, Val:His, BCAA:His, Thr:Lys, Leu:Thr, :Thr, Val:Thr, BCAA:Thr, (Phe+):Lys, Leu:(Phe+), :(Phe+), Val:(Phe+), BCAA:(Phe+), LNAA:Lys, Leu:LNAA, :LNAA, Val:LNAA, and BCAA:LNAA. Amino acids were expressed on standardized ileal digestible basis. The MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used to develop the equations. The inverse of squared SEM was used to account for heterogeneous errors using the  statement. Models were selected with a step-wise manual forward selection. In order to be included in the final model, predictor variables had to be statistically significant (P < 0.05) and provide an improvement of at least 2 points in Bayesian information criterion. The optimum equations were: ADG, g = - 985.94 + (15.2499 × average BW (kg)) - (0.08885 × average BW × average BW) + (1.063 × Leu:Lys) + (20.2659 × :Lys) - (0.1479 × :Lys × :Lys) + (9.2243 × (+Val):Leu) - (0.03321 × (+Val):Leu × (+Val):Leu) - (0.4413 × :Trp); G:F, g/kg = 648.3 - (6.2974 × average BW (kg)) + (0.02051 × average BW × average BW) + (0.5396 × :Lys) + (1.7284 × Val:Lys) - (0.00795 × Val:Lys × Val:Lys) - (1.7594 × Met:Lys); and ADFI, kg = predicted ADG/predicted G:F. Overall, the prediction equations suggest that increasing Leu:Lys negatively impacts ADG due to a reduction in G:F and ADFI caused by insufficient levels of other BCAA and LNAA relative to Leu. According to the model, the addition of Val, , and Trp, alone or in combination, has the potential to counteract the negative effects of high dietary Leu concentrations on growth performance.© The Author(s) 2019.

Three groups of breeding pigeons in the lactation period (n = 30 pairs/group) were respectively injected with rapamycin (RAPA, a specific inhibitor of the target of rapamycin complex) at doses of 0 (vehicle, control), 0.6, or 1.2 mg/kg  (BW)/day via the wing vein for 7 days. The average daily feed intake (ADFI) and BW of the breeding pigeons and the BW of young squabs were respectively recorded throughout the experimental period. The breeding pigeons were sacrificed to collect their crop tissues, crop milk, and serum on the eighth day of the experiment. The results showed that neither 0.6 nor 1.2 mg/kg BW RAPA injection affected BW loss or ADFI in breeding pigeons (P > 0.05), while crop thickness and crop relative  were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in the 1.2 mg/kg BW rapamycin-injected group. Simultaneously, RAPA (especially at 1.2 mg/kg BW) decreased the crude protein, αs1-casein, αs2-casein, β-casein, and amino acid contents (Asp, Thr, Ser, Glu, Gly, Ala, Cys, Val, Met, , Leu, , Lys, His, Arg, and Pro) of crop milk (P < 0.05) and the concentrations of albumin, total protein, and uric acid in the serum of breeding pigeons (P < 0.05). Additionally, the expression of TORC1 pathway-related proteins (TORC1, S6K1, S6, 4EBP1, and eIF4E) was downregulated in the crop tissues of breeding pigeons by 0.6 or 1.2 mg/kg BW/day RAPA injection (P < 0.05). Accordingly, the average daily gain (ADG) of young squabs declined, and the mortality rate increased significantly (P < 0.05). Together, the results showed that RAPA reduced protein and amino acid levels in the crop milk of breeding pigeons and retarded young squab growth, suggesting a crucial role of TORC1 in crop milk synthesis in breeding pigeons.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30949723>Metabolomic signature of type 1 diabetes-induced sensory loss and nerve damage in diabetic neuropathy.</a></h1><p>Diabetic-induced peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a highly complex and frequent diabetic late complication, which is manifested by prolonged hyperglycemia. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of nerve damage and sensory loss remain largely unclear. Recently, alteration in metabolic flux has gained attention as a basis for organ damage in diabetes; however, peripheral sensory neurons have not been adequately analyzed with respect to metabolic dysfunction. In the present study, we attempted to delineate the sequence of event occurring in alteration of metabolic pathways in relation to nerve damage and sensory loss. C57Bl6/j wild-type mice were analyzed longitudinally up to 22 weeks in the streptozotocin (STZ) model of type 1 diabetes. The progression of DPN was investigated by behavioral measurements of sensitivity to thermal and mechanical stimuli and quantitative morphological assessment of intraepidermal nerve fiber density. We employed a mass spectrometry-based screen to address alterations in levels of metabolites in peripheral sciatic nerve and amino acids in serum over several months post-STZ administration to elucidate metabolic dysfunction longitudinally in relation to sensory dysfunction. Although hyperglycemia and  changes occurred early, sensory loss and reduced intraepithelial branching of nociceptive nerves were only evident at 22 weeks post-STZ. The longitudinal metabolites screen in peripheral nerves demonstrated that compared with buffer-injected age-matched control mice, mice at 12 and 22 weeks post-STZ showed an early impairment the tricaoboxylic acid (TCA cycle), which is the main pathway of carbohydrate metabolism leading to energy generation. We found that levels of citric acid, ketoglutaric acid (2 KG), succinic acid, fumaric acid, and malic acid were observed to be significantly reduced in sciatic nerve at 22 weeks post-STZ. In addition, we also found the increase in levels of sorbitol and L-lactate in peripheral nerve from 12 weeks post-STZ injection. Amino acid screen in serum showed that the amino acids valine (Val), isoleucine (), and leucine (Leu), grouped together as BCAA, increased more than twofold from 12 weeks post-STZ. Similarly, the levels of tyrosine (), asparagine (Asn), serine (Ser), histidine (His), alanine (Ala), and proline (Pro) showed progressive increase with progression of diabetes. Our results indicate that the impaired TCA cycle metabolites in peripheral nerve are the primary cause of shunting metabolic substrate to compensatory pathways, which leads to sensory nerve fiber loss in skin and contribute to onset and progression of peripheral neuropathy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29068450>Soy peptide aggregates formed during hydrolysis reduced protein extraction without decreasing their nutritional value.</a></h1><p>Upon enzymatic hydrolysis, soy protein isolates showed a strong tendency to aggregate, presenting a significant loss of valuable proteins. This study mainly focused on the large insoluble aggregates formed during proteolysis, and the influence of heating was further explored for a better understanding of the mechanism involved. The results from SDS-PAGE and amino acid analysis clearly showed that the insoluble aggregates formed upon hydrolysis were aggregated peptides, mainly attributed to the hydrophobic interactions between peptides with hydrophobic amino acids (Val, Ala, Leu, , , Phe, and Pro) and sulfur-containing (Met and Cys) residues. Heating of the hydrolysates further enhanced the peptide-protein interactions through hydrophobic forces and disulfide bonds, accelerating the aggregation, where fractions from the basic subunits of glycinin were particularly involved. Furthermore, taking into consideration the fact that aggregates had a high proportion of essential amino acids, the in vitro digestion properties of the aggregates were also investigated. Interestingly, the relatively pepsin-resistant aggregates showed a high degradability toward pancreatin, releasing low molecular weight peptides possessing a higher proportion of antioxidative amino acids, which therefore had a better antioxidant activity. These results indicated a potential use of the insoluble peptide aggregates as protein supplements or active delivery systems for human consumption.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30486436>Two Novel Multi-Functional Peptides from Meat and Visceral Mass of Marine Snail  and Their Activities In Vitro and In Vivo.</a></h1><p> () is a marine snail with high nutritional and commercial value; however, little is known about its active peptides. In this study, two multi-functional peptides, YSQLENEFDR (-Ser-Gln-Leu-Glu-Asn-Glu-Phe-Asp-Arg) and YIAEDAER (--Ala-Glu-Asp-Ala-Glu-Arg), were isolated and purified from meat and visceral mass extracts of  using a multi-bioassay-guided method and were characterized by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Both peptides showed high antioxidant, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory, and anti-diabetic activities, with half-maximal effective concentrations values less than 1 mM. Antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activities were significantly higher for YSQLENEFDR than for YIAEDAER. In a zebrafish model, the two peptides exhibited strong scavenging ability for reactive  species and effectively protected skin cells against oxidative damage without toxicity. Molecular docking simulation further predicted the interactions of the two peptides and ACE. Stability analysis study indicated that the two synthetic peptides maintained their activities under thermal stress and simulated gastrointestinal digestion conditions. The low molecular weight, high proportion of hydrophobic and negatively-charged amino acids, and specific C-terminal and N-terminal amino acids may contribute to the observed bio-activities of these two peptides with potential application for the prevention of chronic noncommunicable diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28378845>Central adiposity-induced plasma-free amino acid alterations are associated with increased insulin resistance in healthy Singaporean adults.</a></h1><p>Recent metabolomics technique reveals a plasma-free amino acid (PFAA)-based metabolite signature that is suggestive of altered PFAAs being an early manifestation of obesity-related insulin resistance. However, the PFAA profiles within non-obese, but more insulin-resistant Asians are not well researched. Compared with Caucasians, Asian populations have more central adiposity, which is generally regarded as metabolically more adverse, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we examined whether PFAA profiling was at least one important factor mediating central adiposity and insulin resistance, and aid in cardiovascular risk assessment in healthy Asians with normal body weight.This was a cross-sectional study. A total of 190 healthy men (n=87 with a mean±s.d. body mass index (BMI) of 23.5±3.5 kg/m) and women (n=103 with a mean±s.d. BMI of 21.4±3.7 kg/m) residing in Singapore took part in this study. PFAA levels were measured by using an amino acid analyzer. Basic anthropometric measurements, fasting blood glucose, fasting serum insulin and lipid profiles were obtained using standard protocols.Seven out of 18 amino acids were significantly correlated with measures of obesity (for example, waist circumference; waist-to-hip ratio and BMI) in current participants. Among them, the plasma concentrations of five amino acids, including Phe, , Met, Ala and His were positively associated with waist-to-hip ratio. With the exception of His, which had no association with insulin resistance, Phe, , Met and Ala were significantly associated with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance (P<0.05). In contrast, no associations were observed between circulating BCAAs (that is, Val, Leu, ), measures of obesity and insulin resistance. However, significant inverse associations were observed between BCAAs and total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein.We found that central adiposity was associated with alterations of specific amino acids. As a result, PFAAs may serve as metabolite predictors of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and dyslipidemia in healthy participants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30321429>Additivity of apparent and standardized ileal digestibility of amino acids in wheat, canola meal, and sorghum distillers dried grains with solubles in mixed diets fed to broiler chickens.</a></h1><p>An experiment was conducted to investigate which method, apparent ileal digestibility (AID) or standardized ileal digestibility (SID), more accurately predicts the digestibility of crude protein (CP) and amino acids (AA) in mixed diets fed to broiler chickens. Male Ross 308 broiler chickens received a standard starter diet from d 0 to 16 post hatching, thereafter grouped into 8 blocks, based on body weight (BW), of 10 birds/cage, and randomly allotted to 6 diets in a randomized complete block design. The 6 diets consisted of a nitrogen-free diet, 3 semi-purified diets, and 2 mixed diets to test the additivity of AID and SID in mixed diets. On d 21 post hatching, digesta from two-thirds of the distal ileum was collected. Using the determined AID or SID for CP and AA in wheat, canola meal (CM), or sorghum distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), the AID or SID for 2 mixed diets based on wheat-CM or wheat-CM-DDGS were predicted and compared with determined AID or SID, respectively. The results revealed that the predicted SID of CP and AA in the wheat-CM mixed diet were consistent with determined values except for Asp and Ser, and all the predicted SID of CP and AA were consistent with the determined values in the wheat-CM-DDGS mixed diet. The determined AID of , Met, Thr, Val, Ala, Cys, Ser, and  in the wheat-CM mixed diet were greater (P < 0.05) than predicted AID values. For the wheat-CM-DDGS mixed diet, the determined AID of Trp, Cys, and Glu were greater (P < 0.05) than the predicted AID values. However, there were more inconsistencies between the determined and predicted values in AID values for wheat-CM than the wheat-CM-DDGS mixed diet than SID values for both diets. In conclusion, the present study confirmed that the SID of CP and AA was more additive than the AID of CP and AA when a mixed diet contained wheat, CM, and DDGS as protein sources in broiler chickens.© 2018 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p></html>
