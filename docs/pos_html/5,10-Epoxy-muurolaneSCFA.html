However, data on breast milk composition and its relation with growth are sparse.We investigated whether short-chain   (SCFAs), known to be present in HM and linked to energy metabolism, are associated with infancy anthropometrics.In a prospective birth cohort, HM hindmilk samples were collected from 619 lactating mothers at 4-8 wk postnatally [median (IQR) age: 33.9 (31.3-36.) y, body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2): 22.8 (20.9-25.2)]. Their offspring, born at 40.1 (39.1-41.0) wk gestation with weight 3.56 (3.22-3.87) kg and 51% male, were assessed with measurement of weight, length, and skinfold thickness at ages 3, 12, and 24 mo, and transformed to age- and sex-adjusted z scores. HM SCFAs were measured by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and GC-MS. Multivariable linear regression models were conducted to analyze the relations between NMR HM SCFAs and infancy growth parameters with adjustment for potential confounders.NMR peaks for HM butyrate, acetate, and formic acid, but not propionate, were detected. Butyrate peaks were 17.8% higher in HM from exclusively breastfeeding mothers than mixed-feeding mothers (P = 0.003). HM butyrate peak values were negatively associated with changes in infant weight (standardized B  = -0.10, P = 0.019) and BMI (B = -0.10, P = 0.018) between 3 and 12 mo, and negatively associated with BMI (B = -0.10, P = 0.018) and mean skinfold thickness (B = -0.10, P = 0.049) at age 12 mo. HM formic acid peak values showed a consistent negative association with infant BMI at all time points (B < = -0.10, P < = 0.014), whereas HM acetate was negatively associated with skinfold thickness at 3 mo (B = -0.10, P = 0.028) and 24 mo (B = -0.10, P = 0.036).These results suggest that HM SCFAs play a beneficial role in weight gain and adiposity during infancy. Further knowledge of HM  function may inform future strategies to support healthy growth.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31405019>Cooked Red Lentils Dose-Dependently Modulate the Colonic Microenvironment in Healthy C57Bl/6 Male Mice.</a></h1><p>Dietary pulses, including lentils, are protein-rich plant foods that are enriched in intestinal health-promoting bioactives, such as non-digestible carbohydrates and phenolic compounds. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of diets supplemented with cooked red lentils on the colonic microenvironment (microbiota composition and activity and epithelial barrier integrity and function). C57Bl/6 male mice were fed one of five diets: a control basal diet (BD), a BD-supplemented diet with , 10 or 20% cooked red lentils (by weight), or a BD-supplemented diet with 0.7% pectin (equivalent soluble fiber level as found in the 20% lentil diet). Red lentil supplementation resulted in increased: (1) fecal microbiota α-diversity; (2) abundance of short-chain  acid ()-producing bacteria (e.g.,  and ); (3) concentrations of fecal SCFAs; (4) mRNA expression of  receptors (G-protein-coupled receptors () and tight/adherens junction proteins (Zona Occulden-1 (), Claudin-2, E-cadherin). Overall, 20% lentil had the greatest impact on colon health outcomes, which were in part explained by a change in the soluble and insoluble fiber profile of the diet. These results support recent public health recommendations to increase consumption of plant-based protein foods for improved health, in particular intestinal health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31079906>Prediction of blood β-hydroxybutyrate content and occurrence of hyperketonemia in early-lactation, pasture-grazed dairy cows using milk infrared spectra.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of milk infrared spectra to predict blood β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentration for use as a management tool for cow metabolic health on pasture-grazed dairy farms and for large-scale phenotyping for genetic evaluation purposes. The study involved 542 cows (Holstein-Friesian and Holstein-Friesian × Jersey crossbreds), from 2 farms located in the Waikato and Taranaki regions of New Zealand that operated under a seasonal-calving, pasture-based dairy system. Milk infrared spectra were collected once a week during the first  wk of lactation. A blood "prick" sample was taken from the ventral labial vein of each cow 3 times a week for the first  wk of lactation. The content of BHB in blood was measured immediately using a handheld device. After outlier elimination, 1,910 spectra records and corresponding BHB measures were used for prediction model development. Partial least square regression and partial least squares discriminant analysis were used to develop prediction models for quantitative determination of blood BHB content and for identifying cows with hyperketonemia (HYK). Both quantitative and discriminant predictions were developed using the phenotypes and infrared spectra from two-thirds of the cows (randomly assigned to the calibration set) and tested using the remaining one-third (validation set). A moderate accuracy was obtained for prediction of blood BHB. The coefficient of determination (R) of the prediction model in calibration was 0.56, with a root mean squared error of prediction of 0.28 mmol/L and a ratio of performance to deviation, calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation of the partial least squares model calibration set to the standard error of prediction, of 1.50. In the validation set, the R was 0.50, with root mean squared error of prediction values of 0.32 mmol/L, which resulted in a ratio of performance to deviation of 1.39. When the reference test for HYK was defined as blood concentration of BHB ≥1.2 mmol/L, discriminant models indicated that milk infrared spectra correctly classified 76% of the HYK-positive cows and 82% of the HYK-negative cows. The quantitative models were not able to provide accurate estimates, but they could differentiate between high and low BHB concentrations. Furthermore, the discriminant models allowed the classification of cows with reasonable accuracy. This study indicates that the prediction of blood BHB content or occurrence of HYK from milk spectra is possible with moderate accuracy in pasture-grazed cows and could be used during routine milk testing. Applicability of infrared spectroscopy is not likely suited for obtaining accurate BHB measurements at an individual cow level, but discriminant models might be used in the future as herd-level management tools for classification of cows that are at risk of HYK, whereas quantitative models might provide large-scale phenotypes to be used as an indicator trait for breeding cows with improved metabolic health.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Strain YLY08 grew optimally at 28-30 °C, at pH 7.0-7. and in the presence of 2.0-3.0 % (w/v) NaCl. Poly--hydroxybutyrate granules were produced. Neighbour-joining, maximum-likelihood and maximum-parsimony phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain YLY08 clustered with the type strain of , with which it exhibited 95.3 % sequence similarity, while the similarity to other genera was below 95.0 %. Genomic analyses, including average nucleotide identity and the digital DNA-DNA hybridization, clearly separated YLY08 from  MCCC 1A11863 with values below the thresholds for species delineation. The major cellular  acid was summed feature 8 (Cω7 and/or Cω6). The sole respiratory quinone detected was Q-10. The polar lipid profile consisted of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, one unidentified aminolipid and one unidentified phospholipid. The genome of strain YLY08, with 38 assembled contigs, was 3.9 Mb long with a G+C content of 59.0 mol%. The results of the phenotypical, phylogenetic and biochemical analyses between the strain YLY08 and the related type strain indicated that this strain represents a novel species in genus  within the family , for which the name  sp. nov. is proposed.

In particular, the contributions of electrode materials and an electric current are analyzed separately. The results showed that the introduction of electrodes (conductive carbon brushes without applied voltage) rapidly decreased the average concentration of  (VFAs) from 6617 mg/L to 174 mg/L quickly, accelerated stabilization of digestion system, and improved methane production by 13.%. When low voltage was supplied, the VFAs concentration declined to 129 mg/L, and methane production increased by 26.3%. Electric current stimulated the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens, but acetotrophic Methanosaeta still made up 27.6-61.9% of archaeal community. Geobacter occurred at the cathode with a low abundance. The energy contained in incremental methane was 4.55 times the consumption of electric energy, indicating the enhanced methanogenesis was mainly attributed to the improved digestion environment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Infections are often linked to the consumption and handling of poultry meat. The aim of the present study was to investigate the caecal microbiota of birds infected with  at different ages. Therefore, a total of 180 birds of the laying hybrid Lohmann Brown-Classic were housed in 12 subgroups of 15 animals each in three performed repetitions. Three birds per subgroup were experimentally infected with  at an age of about 21 days and about 78 days (4.46 ± 0.35 log CFU/bird). Twenty-one days after experimental infection, microbiome studies were performed on 72 caecal samples of dissected birds (three primary infected and three further birds/subgroup). Amplification within the hypervariable region V 4 of the 16S rRNA gene was performed and sequenced with the Illumina MiSeq platform. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS Enterprise Guide (version 7.1) and R (version 3..2). Both factors, the experimental replication ( < 0.001) and the chickens' age at infection ( < 0.001) contributed significantly to the differences in microbial composition of the caecal samples. The factor experimental replication explained 24% of the sample's variability, whereas the factor age at infection explained 14% thereof. Twelve of 32 families showed a significantly different count profile between the two age groups, whereby strongest differences were seen for seven families, among them the family  (adjusted  = 0.003). The strongest difference between age groups was seen for a bacterial species that is assigned to the genus  which in turn belongs to the family  (adjusted  < 0.0001). Correlation analyses revealed a common relationship in both chicken ages at infection between the absolute abundance of  and , which consists of the genus  In general, concentrations of particular  (VFA) demonstrated a negative correlation to absolute abundance of , whereby the strongest link was seen for n-butyrate (-0.51141;  < 0.0001). Despite performing consecutive repetitions, the factor experimental replication contributed more to the differences of microbial composition in comparison to the factor age at infection.Copyright © 2019 Hankel, Jung, Kuder, Keller, Keller, Galvez, Strowig and Visscher.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650328>Successful elevation of circulating acetate and propionate by dietary modulation does not alter T-regulatory cell or cytokine profiles in healthy humans: a pilot study.</a></h1><p>Increased circulating concentrations of short-chain   () achieved by ingestion of high-fibre diets is associated with anti-inflammatory effects through promotion of FoxP3+ regulatory T(reg) cells in mouse models. This study aimed to determine whether similar increments in blood  levels can be achieved in humans and whether these are associated with similar immune modulatory effects.In a pilot single-blinded, randomised, controlled cross-over study in ten healthy subjects, the effects were determined of high- (39 g/day) and low-fibre (18 g/day) intake (all food provided) on  (gas chromatography), proportions of Treg cells (flow cytometry) and a panel of cytokines (multiplex methodology) measured in peripheral blood at day  of each diet.Actual fibre intake differed between the diets by 19 [16-21] g/day (P< 0.001). Median [range] total plasma  levels with high-fibre intake were 174. [104.8-249.] µmol/L, which were greater than those associated with low-fibre intake at 59.0 [26.-79.9] (P < 0.001). Differences were significantly different for both acetate and propionate. The frequencies of total CD4 T cells and T-regulatory cells, and concentrations of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines were not significantly different between the dietary interventions.Plasma  levels can be modulated by altering dietary fibre consumption in healthy individuals with increments similar to those achieved in murine studies. Five days of diet intervention did not result in changes in regulatory T-cell proportions and cytokine concentrations in peripheral blood, and may require longer duration of dietary change.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31430672> production from saccharification residue from food waste ethanol fermentation: Effect of pH and microbial community.</a></h1><p>In this study, residue from saccharification and centrifugation of food waste ethanol fermentation was used as substrate to produce . The effects of different pH (., 6., and uncontrolled) on the VFAs concentration, composition, acidogenic efficiency and microbial community distribution were investigated. The results showed that the highest concentration of VFAs was 267.8 ± 8.9 mg COD/g VS at pH of 6., and the highest percentage of butyric acid (79.8%) was followed by propionic acid and acetic acid at the end of the reaction. Microbial analysis showed that the contents of Vagococcus and Actinomyces increased, while the contents of Bacteroides and Fermentimonas decreased during anaerobic fermentation. The comparative high pH induced the accumulation of butyric acid. This study provides a new idea for the step anaerobic fermentation of food waste to produce alcohol and acid simultaneously.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Some non-Saccharomyces species have been described as part of the fermentative microbiota, specially found in the initial steps of wine fermentations. These species may play roles from wine spoilage to flavor quality enhancement. From a large number of wine fermentations (429 wine samples), analyzed by ITS-amplicon sequencing to define their mycobiome, 2 non-conventional yeast species (Nakazawaea ishiwadae and Lodderomyces elongisporus) were detected, in a very limited number of samples but in significant levels of relative abundance. One strain of each species was isolated and their technological and enological potential have been characterized in this work. Compared with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Viniferm Revelacion wine strain, the studied N. ishiwadae BMK17.1 and L. elongisporus BMK12. strains showed, as expected, a lower tolerance and growth fitness in high ethanol concentrations. However, N. ishiwadae BMK17.1 was able to grow also at 15% ethanol and L. elongisporus BMK12. at 10% reaching, in the latter case, slightly higher efficiency rates than S. cerevisiae at this level. Contrary to most non-Saccharomyces yeasts, these species were able to growth in presence of high doses of potassium-metabisulfite, reaching in both cases higher efficiency rates than S. cerevisiae. A notable affinity of L. elongisporus BMK12. for high pH values was clearly observed. Their fermentation kinetics and the final chemical-analytical characterization were studied in micro-fermentation assays, using synthetic grape must. L. elongisporus BMK12. was able to complete, in single inoculation, the sugar fermentation after 19 days, but, N. ishiwadae BMK17.1 left about 80 g/L sugars at this time. Co-inoculation assays (in a 1:100 proportion of S. cerevisiae:non-Saccharomyces strains) finished sugar consumption with similar kinetics than the S. cerevisiae single inoculation, in the case of L. elongisporus BMK12. co-inoculation, and with lower kinetics when using N. ishiwadae BMK17.1. A remarkable malic acid consumption and a low acetic acid production was associated with L. elongisporus BMK12. fermentations, together with a high production of 3-methyl-1-butanol and 2-phenylethanol, and the release of high amounts of proteins into the wines. N. ishiwadae BMK17.1, although unable to finish the fermentation itself, showed a high production of oligosaccharides and  compounds such as isobutanol or isobutyric acid. This work reports, for the first time, the occurrence and enological potential of two strains pertaining to the non-conventional yeast genera Lodderomyces and Nakazawaea.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

One of the problems is that for the polar probe molecules of dichloromethane, acetone, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, and ethanol, the molecular area of each probe has different values in literature. In this paper, we point out the incorrect molecular area values presented in the literature by comparing these values with those indicated in Smallwood's Handbook of Organic Solvent Properties. The correct molecular area values of 11 polar probes are determined by plotting the molecular areas of the polar probes versus the van der Waals surface areas reported in the handbook. The correct molecular areas for six common polar probes, namely, dichloromethane, trichloromethane, acetone, ethyl acetate, diethyl ether, and tetrahydrofuran, are 38.0, 44.0, 42., 48.0, 47.0, and 45.0 Å, respectively. Benzene is a specific molecule with a conjugated π-bond structure, and its molecular area is estimated to be larger than that of other molecules. Therefore, benzene is unsuitable for use as a probe molecule.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, we aimed to develop a controlled biopolymer-based chemistry that enables linking metal-binding (here Ga-68) chelators.The nanoparticle (NP) agent was created by self-assembling of folic acid-modified polyglutamic acid and chelator-modified chitosan followed by radiolabeling with Ga (III) ions (Ga-NODAGA-FA). The structure of modified biopolymers was characterized by spectroscopy. Particle size and mobility were determined.Significant selective binding of NPs was established in vitro using folate receptor-positive KB and - negative MDA-MB-231 cell lines. In vivo tumor uptake of folate-targeted Ga-radiolabeled NPs was tested using subcutaneous tumor-bearing CB17 SCID mice models. PET/MR dual modalities showed high tumor uptake with 6. tumor-to-muscle ratio and NP localization.In vivo results supporting the preliminary in vitro tests demonstrated considerably higher Ga-NODAGA-FA nanoparticle accumulation in KB tumors than in MDA-MB-231 tumors, thereby confirming the folate receptor-mediated uptake of this novel potential PET imaging agent.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

It is a etrospective, descriptive and multicenter study, based on the collection of data from the clinical records of patients from 0 to 19 years with CH secondary to perinatal infarction in different centers of the community of Catalonia. A total of 310 children were included (55% males and 45% females), from a total of 13 centers in Catalonia. Average age of onset of the crises was 2 ± 1 year. Epilepsy was present in 29.% (n = 76), among which the most frequent vascular subtype was arterial presumed perinatal ischemic stroke (51.3%), followed by neonatal arterial ischemic stroke (18.4%), periventricular venous infarction (15.8%), neonatal hemorrhagic stroke (10.%) and neonatal cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (3.9%). Semiology of the most frequent seizures was motor focal in 82%, followed by focal motor with secondary bilateralization in 23%, focal discognitive in 13.%, generalized by 2% and spasms in 6.%. The 67.3% were controlled with monotherapy and the drugs used were valproate, levetiracetam or carbamazepine.

The BMP was in the range of 119.16-485.90 mLCH/gVS, and increased by 80.31%-210.16% after HTT, while reduced 23.94% at hydrothermal treatment severity (HTS) .21. The cell wall was more greatly disrupted with increasing HTS, accompanied with the increase of  (VFAs) and fermentation inhibitors (-HMF and more complex chemical compositions) recoveries. The reducing sugar yields were 0.94-3.65% and obtained its maximum at a retention time of 30 min. Illumina MiSeq sequencing clarified that, the phylum Chloroflexi with functions of hydrolysis and acidogenesis, decreased with increasing HTS. The family Methanosaetaceae belonging to acetoclastic methanogens, had an unexpected decrease at HTS .21. As the response, VFAs concentration was less than 1 g/L after biochemical metabolism, while high concentrations of VFAs and inhibitors at HTS .21 led to the poor performance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The concentration of biochar was , 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 g/L and added in inoculum along with wheat straw for anaerobic action. Results showed that 10 g/L of hardwood biochar led to 2-fold increment in methane yield (223 L/kg VS) compared to the control (110 L/kg VS). However, increasing the concentration of hardwood biochar did not help in significant increase in methane yield and raised pH and alkalinity up to 8.3 and 24.3 g/L respectively. Principal component analysis showed that methane yield is positively correlated with  solid reduction while biochar loading is directly correlated with pH as well as alkalinity and inversely correlated with total   acid.

Nanoemulsions increase LCn3PUFA bioavailability, but may cause lipid oxidation. This study examined oxidative stability of LCn3PUFA algal oil-in-water nanoemulsions created by ultrasound using natural and synthetic emulsifiers during -weeks of storage at 4, 20 and 40°C.  acid composition, droplet size ranges and  compounds were analysed.No significant differences were found for  acid composition at various temperatures and storage times. Lecithin nanoemulsions had significantly larger droplet size ranges at baseline and during storage regardless of temperatures. While combined Tween 40 and lecithin nanoemulsions had low initial droplet size ranges, there were significant increases at 40°C after -weeks storage. Gas chromatograms identified hexanal and propanal as predominant  compounds, along with 2-ethylfuran; propan-3-ol; valeraldehyde. The Tween 40 only nanoemulsion sample showed formation of lower concentrations of volatiles compared to lecithin samples. Formation of hexanal and propanal remained stable at lower temperatures although higher concentrations were found in nanoemulsions than bulk oil. The lecithin only sample had formation of higher concentrations of volatiles at increased temperatures despite having significantly larger droplet size ranges than the other samples.Propanal and hexanal were the most prevalent of five  compounds detected in bulk oil and lecithin and/or Tween 40 nanoemulsions. Oxidation compounds remained more stable at lower temperatures indicating suitability for enrichment of refrigerated foods.

Particulate matter emitted from commercial and residential cooking is a significant contributor to both indoor and outdoor aerosols. The PM emission rates and source profiles are impacted by many factors (cooking method, food type, oil type, fuel type, additives, cooking styles, cooking temperature, source surface area, pan, and ventilation) discussed in previous studies. To determine which cooking activities are most influential on PM emissions and work towards cleaner cooking, an experiment design based on multi-factor and level orthogonal tests was conducted in a laboratory that is specifically designed to resemble a professional restaurant kitchen. In this cooking test, four main parameters (the proportion of meat in ingredients, flavor, cooking technique, oil type) were chosen and five levels for each parameter were selected to build up 25 experimental dishes. Concentrations of PM emission rates, organic carbon/elemental carbon (OC/EC), water-soluble ions, elements, and main organic species (PAHs, n-alkanes, alkanoic ,  , dicarboxylic , polysaccharides, and sterols) were investigated across 25 cooking tests. The statistical significance of the data was analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with ranges calculated to determine the influence orders of the 4 parameters. The PM emission rates of 25 experimental dishes ranged from 0.1 to 9.2 g/kg of ingredients. OC, EC, water-soluble ions (WSI), and elements accounted for 10.49-94.85%, 0-1.74%, 10.09-40.03%, and 0.04-3.93% of the total PM, respectively.  , dicarboxylic , n-alkanes, alkanoic , and sterols were the most abundant organic species and accounted for 2.32-93.04%, 0.84-60.36%, 0-45.05%, and 0-25.42% of total PM, respectively. There was no significant difference between the 4 parameters on PM emission rates, while a significant difference was found in WSI, elements, n-alkanes, and dicarboxylic  according to ANOVA. Cooking technique was found to be the most influential factor for PM source profiles, followed by the proportion of meat in ingredients and oil type which resulted in significant difference of 183.19, 185.14, and 115.08 g/kg of total PM for dicarboxylic , n-alkanes, and WSI, respectively.

Natural polyphenols can protect the kidney from diabetic nephropathy exerting antioxidant activities. The present approach enumerates the reno-protective and anti-apoptotic effects of mangosteen vinegar rind (MVR, a phenolic aqueous extract) against high-fat diet ( g/day up to five weeks)-/streptozotocin (single ip, dose 30 mg/kgBW)-induced T2D nephropathy of albino mice. In vitro total phenolic content, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) activity, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) antioxidant capacity, and α-amylase inhibition activity as antidiabetic assay of MVR were performed. In vivo mice body weight, oral glucose, and maltose tolerance test, metabolic parameters (plasma glucose, insulin level, omeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance), biochemical parameters (kidney hypertrophy, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine), oxidative stress parameters (malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, catalase) were estimated in an intervention study. Additionally, renal morphology and early apoptosis were observed following the H & E staining and TUNEL assay of the tissue frozen section. We found that the aqueous extract of MVR possesses potent in vitro antioxidative and antidiabetic activities. Animal intervention results showed that MVR 100, 200 mg/kgBW, and Glibenclamide 60 mg/kgBW treatments significantly improved (P < 0.05) the abovementioned parameters compared to the diabetic control group. Furthermore, treatments also significantly restored (P < 0.05) kidney histological alterations and reduced cellular apoptosis compared to the diabetic control group. These findings concluded that MVR treatments significantly modulated the glucose intolerance, metabolic alterations, and oxidative stress-induced pathological alterations and cellular apoptosis of diabetic kidney. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Garcinia mangostana, a polyphenol rich natural product, is obtained from the tropical rain forest area of Southeast Asian countries and processes diverse biological activities including antioxidant, anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, and so on. This research first time focuses on the nephro-protective and anti-apoptotic effects of mangosteen vinegar rind (MVR) from the mangosteen fruit pericarp. Our study provides the efficient data to prove the beneficial effect of MVR as a dietary supplement for the prevention and management of diabetic nephropathy.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31125882>Mechanisms of free nitrous acid and freezing co-pretreatment enhancing short-chain   production from waste activated sludge anaerobic fermentation.</a></h1><p>Free nitrous acid (FNA) or freezing has been recently utilized as an efficient pretreatment method to increase short-chain   (SCFAs) yield from waste activated sludge (WAS) anaerobic fermentation (AF). But until now, the performances and mechanisms of the co-pretreatment for SCFAs production are unknown. This research aimed to investigate the AF mechanisms through studying its influence on sludge solubilization and related bioprocesses. WAS was pretreated for 48 h with FNA (1.07 mg N/L), freezing (- °C) and combination of FNA and freezing (0.53-2.13 mg N/L FNA at - °C), respectively, then conducted batch AF. Experimental results indicated that the optimal total SCFAs yield of 391.19 ± .54 mg COD/g VSS was achieved after 1.07 mg N/L FNA + freezing pretreatment at 9 days of AF, which was 2.2, 1.6 and 1.3-fold of the blank, freezing and FNA pretreated samples, respectively. The mechanisms analysis showed that co-pretreatment showed synergetic effects on sludge disintegration and solubilization, which could release more soluble substrates for SCFAs production. The co-pretreatment resulted in slight inhibition to hydrolysis and negligible inhibition to acidogenesis but severe inhibition to methanogenesis, maybe due to less endurance of methanogens.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Five rumen-fistulated male Holstein calves (147.0 ± .8 kg of body weight; 3.6 ± 0.2 mo of age) were used in a crossover design, and 0 g (control group, n = ) or 2 g (SC group, n = ) of ADSC (1 × 10 cfu/g) was administered twice daily for 21 consecutive days. Calves were fed a high-forage diet during the first 15 d (d -14 to d 0; prechallenge), a high-grain diet for 2 d (d 1 and 2; ruminal acidosis challenge), and a high-forage diet for 4 d (d 3 to 6; postchallenge). Ruminal pH was measured continuously. Rumen fluid samples were collected once daily (0800 h) on d 0, 3, 4, and 6 and twice daily (0800 and 1100 h) on d 1 and 2. Bacterial DNA was extracted from fluid samples collected on d 0 and 3. The 24-h and 1-h mean ruminal pH was significantly depressed during the ruminal acidosis challenge in each group, although the changes were more severe in the SC group, consistent with a significant increase in lactic acid on d 2 (1100 h) compared with d 0 and a significantly higher proportion of butyric acid on d 2 (1100 h) compared with the control group. Feeding a high-grain diet caused a decrease in bacterial diversity due to high acidity in both groups. The relative abundances of the genus Bifidobacterium and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) 3 (Bifidobacterium species) increased significantly in both groups but were higher in the SC group. Correlation analyses indicated that OTU3 (Bifidobacterium species) were positively correlated with lactic acid concentration and that OTU1 (Prevotella species) and OTU5 (Succinivibrio species) were correlated with the proportion of butyric acid. These results suggest that ADSC supplementation induced the intense decreases in ruminal pH by increased butyric and lactic acid production through a high-grain diet fermentation by rumen fluid bacterial species during the short-term ruminal acidosis challenge in Holstein calves after weaning.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Xiexin Tang (XXT), a compound recipe composed of Dahuang (Rheum palmatum L.), Huangqin (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi) and Huanglian (Coptis chinensis Franch.), has been reported to have hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects, but its mechanism remains unclear. Our previous study found that Xiexin Tang markedly ameliorated the composition of the gut microbiota, especially for some short chain   (SCFAs) producing bacteria, and then notably increased SCFAs production. However, the mechanism of XXT on the fermentation of gut bacteria and further improvement of obesity is not yet clear.This study aimed to unravel the molecular mechanism of XXT on the amelioration of obesity.Here, high-fat diet-induced obese rat model was established to investigate the intervention efficacy following oral administration of XXT. Additionally, the expressions of key enzymes of gut microbe-derived SCFAs biosynthesis and key targets in the signaling pathway of energy metabolism were investigated by ELISA and qPCR analysis.Results showed that XXT could notably correct lipid metabolism disorders, alleviate systematic inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity and reduce fat accumulation. Additionally, XXT could increase gut microbiota-derived SCFAs-producing capacity by enhancing mRNA levels and activities of -synthetic key enzymes such as acetate kinase (ACK), methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MMD), butyryl-CoA: acetate CoA transferase (BUT) and butyrate kinase (BUK), which markedly decreased the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) contents, elevated adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels and further lowered the energy charge (EC) in obese rats via activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α)/uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) signaling pathway. What's more, XXT could notably ameliorate dyslipidemia via increasing the gene expression of '-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and blocking mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway.Taken together, our data provided a novel insight into the role of XXT in losing weight from energy metabolism regulation, which unraveled the molecular mechanism of XXT on the alleviation of dyslipidemia and fat heterotopic accumulation. The study provided useful information for XXT in clinical application to treat obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Short-chain   (SCFAs) and lactate are primary metabolites that can impact the composition and function of human microbiota. According to the well-characterized key synthesis genes, many - and lactate-producing bacteria have been identified in the gut microbiota. However, unknown genes may also contribute to the formation of SCFAs and lactate. The identification of such genes will provide new engineering targets and new strategies for maintaining a stable structure of beneficial microbiota.

The functions of nineteen candidate genes were studied by targeted gene deletion and overexpression. Results indicated thioesterase genes such as , , , and  can contribute to acetate and/or butyrate formation. As for lactate,  and  can function in addition to  gene. At the same time, the distribution of these functional genes in gut microbiota was investigated. Most bacteria contain the well-studied genes whereas some bacteria contain some of the described unusual ones.

To address this gap, we designed a two-phase experiment in which we performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing and monitored the metabolic parameters, gut-brain mediators, and sex hormones of PCOS patients. In the first stage, we identified an imbalance in the intestinal microbiota of the PCOS patients, observing that , , and  were significantly more abundant in the control group, whereas  and  were enriched in the PCOS group. In the second stage, we monitored the impact of the probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis V9 on the intestinal microbiome, gut-brain mediators, and sex hormones of 14 PCOS patients. Notably, we observed that the levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and LH/follicle-stimulating hormone (LH/FSH) decreased significantly in 9 volunteers, whereas the levels of sex hormones and intestinal short-chain   (SCFAs) increased markedly. In contrast, the changes in the indices mentioned above were indistinct in the remaining  volunteers. The results of an analysis of the number of viable Bifidobacterium lactis V9 cells in the two groups were highly consistent with the clinical and  results. Therefore, effective host gut colonization of the probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis V9 was crucial for its ability to function as a probiotic. Finally, we propose a potential mechanism describing how probiotics regulate the levels of sex hormones by manipulating the intestinal microbiome in PCOS patients.  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common metabolic disorder among women of reproductive age worldwide. Through a two-phase clinical experiment, we first revealed an imbalance in the intestinal microbiome of PCOS patients. By binning and annotating shotgun metagenomic sequences into metagenomic species (MGS), 61 MGSs were identified as potential PCOS-related microbial biomarkers. In the second stage, we monitored the impact of the probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis V9 on the intestinal microbiota, metabolic parameters, gut-brain mediators, and sex hormones of PCOS patients. Notably, we observed that the PCOS-related clinical indices and the intestinal microbiotas of the participating patients exhibited an inconsistent response to the intake of the B. lactis V9 probiotic. Therefore, effective host gut colonization of the probiotic was crucial for its ability to function as a probiotic.

The results show that NaOH pretreatment can significantly boost the release of biogas and heavy metals from rice straw using anaerobic digestion. Under the optimal conditions for biomass pretreated 6% (w/w) NaOH with a solid-to-solution ratio of 1:20, total biogas and methane yields of 446.3 mL/g and 263. mL/g  solids were achieved, which were 22.18% and 41.59% higher than those of the control without NaOH pretreatment, respectively, and the release percentages of Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn from rice straw reached 86.95-97.69%. The release of heavy metals from rice straw can contribute to both the degradation of lignin by NaOH pretreatment and the utilization/transformation of lignocellulose via anaerobic digestion. The acidification levels and total   acid contents significantly influence on the release of heavy metals. Based on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing analysis, the dominant phyla in the biogas residues were proteolytic (Bacteroidetes) and hydrogen-producing (Firmicutes) bacteria, while the growth of Methanospirillum and Methanosaeta in anaerobically digested effluent was promoted.

Lignocellulose hydrolysate, a non-edible resource, is a promising substrate for the sustainable, fermentative production of PHB. However, its application is limited by the generation of inhibitors during the pretreatment processes. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of PHB production in  in the presence of inhibitors found in lignocellulose hydrolysates. Our results show that the introduction of PHB synthetic genes (, , and  from  H16) improved cell growth in the presence of the inhibitors such as furfural, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and vanillin, suggesting that PHB synthetic genes confer resistance to these inhibitors. In addition, increased PHB production was observed in the presence of furfural as opposed to the absence of furfural, suggesting that this compound could be used to stimulate PHB production. Our findings indicate that PHB production using lignocellulose hydrolysates in recombinant  could be an innovative strategy for cost-effective PHB production, and PHB could be a good target product from lignocellulose hydrolysates, especially glucose.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31260967>Dynamic controlled atmosphere: Impact of elevated storage temperature on anaerobic metabolism and quality of 'Nicoter' apples.</a></h1><p>The aim of the study was to evaluate an elevated (3.0 °C) and low (1.0 °C) storage temperature combined with dynamic controlled atmosphere monitored by respiratory quotient (DCA-RQ) and chlorophyll fluorescence (DCA-CF) on anaerobic metabolism, physiological storage disorders and overall quality of 'Nicoter' ('Kanzi®') apples after . and 8.0 months of storage plus 7d shelf-life.

We investigated the effects of replacing AH with CS in the starter diet on nutrient intake, digestibility, growth performance, rumen fermentation and selected blood metabolites in Holstein calves. Newborn male calves (n = 30; 3 days of age; 40.2 ± 1.28 kg BW) were assigned randomly to three groups receiving starter diets containing chopped AH (10% dry matter (DM) basis; AH diet), CS (10% DM, CS diet) or their combination (each at % level; AHCS diet). The starter diets had the same nutrient composition but differed in DM content (91.2%, 87.% and 83.8% for AH, AHCS and CS, respectively). The calves were weaned on day 50, and the study continued until day 70. Nutrient intake, BW (at weaning and at the end of the study) and body measurements were not affected by the diet. During the post-weaning period, average daily gain tended to be greater on CS than on AH diet. Feed efficiency was greater in CS than in AH or AHCS calves during the post-weaning period. Digestibility of neutral detergent fiber was greater in AHCS and CS compared with AH during the post-weaning period. Concentration and profile of  and ruminal fluid pH were not affected by the diet. Replacing AH with CS in the starter diet had no effect on feed intake, growth performance and general health of the calves. These results indicate that AH and CS can be used interchangeably in dairy calf starter diets until 70 days of age, allowing dairy producers more choices in selecting the feed ingredients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075646>Influence of electron acceptors on hexanoic acid production by Clostridium kluyveri.</a></h1><p>Clostridium kluyveri was used for chain elongation of C2C4   in stirred tank bioreactors. The influence of different electron acceptors (acetic acid, butyric acid and the mixture of both) on C6  acid production was evaluated in presence of ethanol using similar molar alcohol/acid ratios around 3.. Bottle batch assays without pH regulation and with only acetic acid as electron acceptor yielded a final C6  acid concentration of 6.8 ± 0.6 g L. Then, pH-regulated bioreactors were operated at constant pH of 6.8. Under such conditions, the maximum growth rate was 0.039 h obtained using acetic acid and butyric acid as electron acceptors, whereas the lowest growth rate was 0.010 h with only butyric acid as electron acceptor. The maximum growth rate with acetic acid only, was similar, though slightly lower, as with the mixture of C2C4  . Besides, the maximum productions of hexanoic acid were 11.8 g L, 13.1 g L and 21.2 g L using, respectively, acetic acid, butyric acid and the mixture of both  as electron acceptors.

The cellobiohydrolase from Lentinula edodes (LeCel7A) was produced in Pichia pastoris. The optimal temperature and pH for LeCel7A were 60 °C and .0, respectively. The recombinant protein enhanced the hydrolysis of three straws. During in vitro rumen fermentation of three straws, the fiber digestibility, concentration of acetate and total , and fermentation liquid microbial protein were increased by LeCel7A. High throughput sequencing and real-time PCR data showed that the effects of LeCel7A on ruminal microbial community depended on the fermentation substrates. The relative abundances of Prevotellaceae_UCG_003 and Saccharofermentans were increased by LeCel7A regardless of agricultural straws. With rice straw, LeCel7A increased the relative abundances of Desulfovibrio, Ruminococcaceae and its some genus. With wheat straw, LeCel7A increased the relative abundances of Succiniclasticum, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Ruminococcus albus. With corn straw, Succiniclasticum, Christensenellaceae_R_7_group and Desulfovibrio were increased by LeCel7A.

In in vitro experiment, the effects of different levels of WSB and CMB (0., 1, and 1.% diet dry matter (DM)) on rumen fermentation characteristics were assessed in a completely randomized design with seven treatments and three replicates. Treatments were as follows: basal diet without biochar (control), basal diet with 0., 1, and 1.% WSB, and basal diet with 0., 1, and 1.% CMB. Addition of 1% WSB and 1.% CMB to the diet linearly decreased methane production and ammonia-N concentrations and increased pH compared to control (P < 0.001). Inclusion of WSB and CMB to the diet did not change volume of gas production and total  (VFA) and proportion of acetate, propionate, and butyrate. In the second experiment, six milking Kermanian ewes were used in a replicated Latin square design with three treatments and three 21-day periods to evaluate the effects of 1% WSB and 1.% CMB (based on results obtained from in vitro trial) on intake, digestibility, and milk yield and composition. Dietary inclusion of 1% WSB and 1.% CMB resulted in more milk yield (P < 0.01), milk protein (P < 0.05), and solids not fat (SNF) (P < 0.001). Blood glucose and total protein increased (P < 0.01) in ewes fed 1% WSB and 1.% CMB in comparison to ewes fed control diet. Apparent digestibility coefficients of DM (P < 0.01) and OM (P < 0.10) were increased with inclusion of 1% WSB and 1.% CMB in diet. Neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility was also increased in WSB-fed ewes (P < 0.01).

A diet with corn was ground and extruded in two different ways, obtaining Low RS (2.2 g/kg DM; 99.9% of SG) and High RS (15.3 g/kg DM; 62.6% of SG). Each diet was fed to adults (4.0 ± 0.7 years) or old beagle dogs (11. ± 0.4 years) in a 2 (ages) x 2 (RS amounts) factorial arrangement with 8 dogs per food. Data were evaluated by analysis of variance, and postprandial responses by analysis of variance of repeated measurements over time ( < 0.05). Diet × age interaction was observed for protein ATTD, with lower values for old dogs fed High RS than those for the other treatments ( < 0.05). No age or diet effect was verified for the ATTD of other nutrients and faecal score. Faecal moisture and pH were higher for adults than that for old dogs ( < 0.05). The High RS food increased acetate, propionate and butyrate concentrations in faeces, regardless of age ( < 0.01). Old dogs presented lower acetate and total short-chain   () and higher lactate and ammonia than adults ( < 0.05). Only for old dogs the intake of the High RS food reduced ammonia and increased faecal lactate ( < 0.05). An age × diet interaction was verified for glucose postprandial response, with lower values for old dogs fed High RS food ( < 0.05), while no differences were found for the other treatments. Old dogs had higher postprandial insulin secretion regardless of the diet ( < 0.05), and lower insulin increment at 180 min after the meal when fed the Low RS than when fed the High RS food ( < 0.05). In conclusion, the diet with lower SG and higher RS improved the intestinal microenvironment, with higher butyrate and total  without altering faeces production or score. Old dogs presented less acetate and total  and higher lactate and ammonia in faeces than adults. The High RS food increased lactate and reduced ammonia in faeces of old dogs, with possible positive influences for gut health. Old dogs had higher postprandial insulin secretion than that of adults to maintain blood glucose, and the diet with higher RS content reduced the postprandial glucose response of old dogs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31325356>Effects of abomasally infused amylase and increasing amounts of corn starch on fecal excretion of starch, total and microbial nitrogen, and  in heifers1.</a></h1><p>The aim of the present study was to study the effect of exogenous amylase on postruminal disappearance of increasing amounts of corn starch being infused into the abomasum of heifers, and to detect a possible limitation of starch digestion in the small intestine. Four rumen-fistulated heifers (2 German Black Pied and 2 Jersey × German Black Pied) with an initial BW of 565 ± 6 kg were fed .6 kg DM/d of a diet targeted to contain only a negligible amount of starch. Animals were assigned randomly to a crossover trial with 2 experimental periods lasting 35 d each with 10 d of diet adaption followed by 25 d of sample collection. During the sampling period, each animal was abomasally infused with native corn starch at  levels (953, 1,213, 1,425, 1,733, and 1,993 g DM/d) each for a -d period with and without exogenous amylase, respectively. At days 6 to 10 the heifers received an abomasal infusion of starch in amounts of 724 g/d. Feces were sampled 4 times a day during the collection periods. Titanium dioxide was ruminally administered (10 g/d) to estimate fecal excretion. Purine bases in feces were determined and used as a marker for microbial N excretion. Fecal excretion of microbial N increased linearly with increasing level of starch infusion (P < 0.001), indicating a constant proportion of the infused starch being fermented in the hindgut. In contrast, the apparent digestibility of starch from the total postruminal tract decreased linearly from 90% to 80% (P < 0.001) when the intestinal starch supply increased from 1 to 2 kg/d. There is strong evidence based on the increasing starch excretion with feces and the indication of a constant proportion of infused starch being fermented in the hindgut for a decreasing efficiency of starch digestion in the small intestine with increasing intestinal supply. Amylase administration increased fecal excretion of butyrate (P = 0.04) and tended to increase isovalerate excretion (P = 0.06). However, amylase did not affect fecal excretion of microbial N or starch, suggesting that pancreatic amylase activity may not be the primarily limiting factor of postruminal starch digestion in heifers when corn starch is abomasally infused in amounts up to 2 kg/d.© The Author(s) 2019.

A total of 32 healthy weaners (9.60 ± 0.13 kg) were allocated to two dietary energy densities (3,400 and 3,800 kcal/kg) and two digestible energy ratio of carbohydrate to fat (9:1 and 3:1) in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. There were eight piglets per treatment. The feed intake of piglets was significantly increased by dietary high carbohydrate ratio (9:1) (p < 0.01); however, this did not result in improved body weight gain (p > 0.05). The piglets fed high carbohydrate energy ratio had a reduced villus height/crypt depth (VH/CD) ratio in the duodenum (p < 0.05), and dietary high energy density further decreased the VH/CD ratio in the ileum (p < 0.01). In the duodenum, the lymphocyte count was increased by dietary high energy density (p < 0.05), while dietary energy density and carbohydrate energy ratio interacted to increase lymphocyte count in the ileum (p < 0.05). The serum cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein were not significantly affected (p > 0.05), but dietary energy density interacted with dietary energy ratio to increase high-density lipoprotein concentration (p < 0.05) in piglets fed reduced carbohydrate energy ratio. Dietary high energy density reduced energy digestibility (p < 0.05), whereas high carbohydrate energy ratio increased crude protein digestibility in the piglets (p < 0.05). The intestinal sucrase, lactase activities and serum concentrations of histidine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, alanine, glycine, tyrosine and citrulline were higher in the piglets fed dietary increased carbohydrate energy ratio. Oxidative stress markers and  concentrations were altered by the dietary treatments. It was concluded that dietary high energy density could be detrimental to piglets intestinal functions and that increased carbohydrate energy ratio could affect amino acid utilization and body weight gain in weaner pigs.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315083>Long-term Physicochemical Stability of Concentrated Solutions of Sodium Valproate in Polypropylene Syringes for Administration in the Intensive Care Unit.</a></h1><p>In some situations, drug solutions in higher concentrations are used in intensive care units. The objective of this study was to evaluate the physicochemical stability of concentrated solutions of valproate sodium in polypropylene syringes during 30 days at °C ± 3°C. Five syringes of 40 mL containing 20 mg/mL of sodium valproate in 0.9% sodium chloride were prepared and stored at °C ± 3°C during 30 days. Immediately after preparation and periodically during the storage, valproate concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Spectrophotometric absorbance at different wavelengths, pH measurement, and microscopic observations were also performed. All solutions were physically stable during the study period storage at °C ± 3°C. No color change, turbidity, precipitation, or opacity at visual observation was noticed. No significant pH variations or optic densities were observed. No crystals were seen by microscopic analysis. Concentrations of valproate remained stable during the period of storage. Solutions of sodium valproate 20 mg/mL in syringes of 0.9% sodium chloride were physically and chemically stable for at least 30 days when stored in syringes at °C ± 3°C. These solutions may be prepared in advance by a centralized intravenous additive service.Copyright© by International Journal of Pharmaceutical Compounding, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31217051>Persistently Upregulated Hippocampal mTOR Signals Mediated by Fecal SCFAs Impair Memory in Male Pups with SMM Exposure in Utero.</a></h1><p>To investigate the molecular mechanisms of the adverse effects of exposure to sulfamonomethoxin (SMM) in pregnancy on the neurobehavioral development of male offspring.Pregnant mice were randomly divided into four groups: control- (normal saline), low- [10 mg/(kg•day)], middle- [50 mg/(kg•day)], and high-dose [200 mg/(kg•day)] groups, which received SMM by gavage daily during gestational days 1-18. We measured the levels of short-chain   (SCFAs) in feces from dams and male pups. Furthermore, we analyzed the mRNA and protein levels of genes involved in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in the hippocampus of male pups by RT-PCR or Western blotting.Fecal  concentrations were significantly decreased in dams. Moreover, the production of individual fecal SCFAs was unbalanced, with a tendency for an increased level of total fecal SCFAs in male pups on postnatal day (PND) 22 and 56. Furthermore, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3k)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mTOR or mTOR/ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1)/4EBP1 signaling pathway was continuously upregulated until PND 56 in male offspring. In addition, the expression of Sepiapterin Reductase (SPR), a potential target of mTOR, was inhibited.In utero exposure to SMM, persistent upregulation of the hippocampal mTOR pathway related to dysfunction of the gut ()-brain axis may contribute to cognitive deficits in male offspring.Copyright © 2019 The Editorial Board of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences.

Eighty calves (40 bulls and 40 heifer calves) were reared indoors in groups (n =  of the same sex/pen). All calves were fed 4 L of CMR/d (175 g/L of CMR) in 2 feeds/d for the first 10 d and then 1 feed/d until d 49 or 84. The calves were gradually weaned by d 56 (earlier weaned; n = 8 pens) and d 91 (later weaned; n = 8 pens). All calves were fed FiberStart ad libitum as the only solid feed source from d 1 to 100 of the study. Irrespective of treatment, all calves had similar body weights at d 0 (40.9 ± 3.0 kg) and d 49 (74.2 ± .1 kg) of the study. Calf sex had no effect on intake, growth, blood, and immune system parameters. Earlier-weaned calves consumed 18% more solid feed dry matter but had 16% lower body weight gain (28.9 vs. 38. kg, respectively) from d 56 to 100 relative to later-weaned calves, resulting in different body weight at 100 d (104 vs. 121 ± 1.3 kg). Although earlier-weaned calves could compensate for the loss of CMR dry matter and crude protein intake from d 56 to 100 by increasing forage intake, they were unable to compensate for the loss of energy from the CMR by increasing solid feed consumption. Plasma β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were 52% greater in earlier-weaned calves than in later-weaned calves at d 84, indicating greater metabolic activity of the rumen wall. The duration of CMR feeding had no influence on humoral or cell-mediated immune functions of the calves, as evidenced by a lack of effect on antivaccine antibody responses as well as on immune gene expression. Earlier- versus later-weaned heifer calves had % lower mammary gland mass, indicating that greater energy supply increased mammary mass. The results of this experiment demonstrate the ability to artificially rear dairy calves on a conserved alfalfa as the only solid feed. Furthermore, earlier weaning off CMR promotes solid feed intake and an associated increase in blood β-hydroxybutyrate, an indicator of rumen development, but increasing the duration of CMR feeding improves growth and mammary gland mass by d 100. The implications of these findings on lifetime growth, health, and milk production in dairy heifers warrant further investigation.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The composition of the microbiome in IF represents an important variable in the physiology and prognosis of this disease.We sought to compare the intestinal microbiome and  concentration of children who require parenteral nutrition (PN) with that of children with short-bowel syndrome (SBS) who have discontinued PN and with age-matched controls, using high-throughput sequencing to investigate host-microbe interactions.Fifty-three samples were submitted over 6-15 months. Six children with SBS + IF submitted 34 samples, and 6 children with SBS with discontinued PN submitted 15 samples; these were compared with samples from  control children. Fecal samples were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA partial gene sequencing using the MiSeq Illumina sequencer. SCFAs were measured in stool samples by mass spectrometry.Butyrate quantity was near absent in children with IF compared with that in controls (median 0.37 nmol/mg vs 10.92 nmol/mg; P < .0001). Similarly, commensal anaerobes known to produce , including Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae, were reduced in those with SBS. SBS + IF enteric samples demonstrated a 168-fold increase in the relative abundance of the Escherichia genus seemingly attributable to the species Escherichia coli.The reduced relative abundance of butyrate-producing Clostridia as well as decreased intestinal butyrate concentration in children with IF support further investigation in therapeutic options that target butyrate-producing bacterial communities or butyrate supplementation.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056467>The relationship between illnesses and medical drug consumption with the occurrence of traffic accidents among truck and bus drivers in Tehran, Iran.</a></h1><p>To determine the relationship of illnesses and medical drug consumption with the occurrence of traffic accidents among truck and bus drivers.This is a cross-sectional study on truck and bus drivers in Tehran, Iran. The criteria for participating in this study were: married males over 30 years old, driving license in grade one, five years of job experience, mental health and non-addiction license. The criterion for not participating in this study was the lack of cooperation in responding to the questions. Six months was spent to collect the latest five years data of driving accidents from 2011 to 2016. A total of 323 truck and bus drivers in Tehran city and the suburbs, Iran were chosen. Among them, 112 were responsible for accidents (accident group) while 211 were not responsible for any accidents or involved in an accident in the last five years (non-accident group). A specially designed questionnaire was used to investigate the demographic information, medical drug consumption, medical backgrounds and history of accidents.The results revealed that compared with healthy subjects, the occurrence of accidents among people with diabetes (OR = 2.3, p = 0.001) and vision weakness (OR = 1.7, p = 0.020) was significantly higher, while that among people with cardiac (OR = 0., p = 0.002) and hypertension (OR = 0.9, p = 0.048) problems was remarkably lower. Moreover, consumption of Gemfibrozil (OR = 1.8, p = 0.010) and Glibenclamide (OR = 2.2, p = 0.002) drugs resulted in significantly higher incidence of accidents than those without.Frequencies of illnesses like cardiovascular and hypertension were not higher in accident drivers than in non-accident drivers; but diabetes, vision weakness and consumption of Gemfibrozil and Glibenclamide lead to more traffic accidents.Copyright © 2019 Chinese Medical Association.

Insects embody a promising answer for being highly nutritious and for showing traits leading to a circular bioeconomy. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) at sea-water stage was fed diets with a partial or complete substitution of fishmeal with meal of Hermetia illucens larvae reared on a media containing Ascophyllum nodosum mixed with organic wastes (60:40). The present study aimed to assess the quality of fillets by characterizing its physico-chemical traits with conventional and innovative methods, such as proton transfer reaction-time of flight-mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS) technique, allowing to analyze samples at room temperature. Finally, steamed fillets underwent a consumer test to enquire the liking of consumers and their intention of re-consumption.Our main findings showed that a complete dietary substitution of fishmeal with H. illucens larvae meal did not impair the physico-chemical quality of A. salmon fillets. Notably, neutral n-3 polyunsaturated   (PUFA) slightly but significantly increased in the fillets of A. salmon fed H. illucens, also due to the additional fish oil present in the diets containing insect. The  organic profile was not altered by the different diets. The consumer liking test revealed that Italian consumers appreciated the tested salmon irrespective of the administered feed.Tailoring the insect  acid profile by rearing the larvae on a PUFA-rich substrate, coupled with a dietary modulation of the oily source, can successfully maintain or even increase the cardioprotective characteristics of fillets.

Probiotics have been shown to exert beneficial health-promoting effects through modulation of intestinal microflora biodiversity, thus the effects of probiotics administration on D-galactose (D-gal) senescence-induced rat were evaluated based on the changes in gut microbiota and metabolomic profiles. Upon senescence induction, the ratio of Firmicutes/ Bacteroidetes was significantly lowered, while treatment with Lactobacillus helveticus OFS 1515 and L. fermentum DR9 increased the ratio at the phylum level (P < 0.05). Study on the genus level showed that L. paracasei OFS 0291 and L. helveticus OFS 1515 administration reduced Bacteroides, which are prominently opportunistic pathogens while L. fermentum DR9 treated rats promoted the proliferation of Lactobacillus compared to the aged rats (P < 0.05). Probiotics treatment did not alter fecal short-chain  acid () profile, but an increase in acetate was observed in the D-gal rats. The analysis of fecal water-soluble metabolites showed that D-gal induced senescence caused great impact on amino  metabolism such as urocanic acid, citrulline, cystamine and -oxoproline, which could serve as potential aging biomarkers. Treatment with probiotics ameliorated these metabolites in a strain-specific manner, whereby L. fermentum DR9 promoted antioxidative effect through upregulation of oxoproline, whereas both L. paracasei OFS 0291 and L. helveticus OFS 1515 restored the levels of reducing sugars, arabinose and ribose similar to the young rats. D-gal induced senescence did cause significant immunological alteration in the colon of aged rats however, all probiotic strains demonstrated immunomodulatory properties as L. paracasei OFS 0291, L. helveticus OFS 1515 and L. fermentum DR9 alleviated proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-1β as well as IL-4 compared to the aged control (P < 0.05).

While essential oils (EO) have become attractive candidates for use in the livestock industry, their mode of action and microbial targets in food animals remain largely uncharacterized. To gain further insight, we investigated the rumen environment of neonatal calves fed calf starter pellets and milk replacer supplemented with a commercial blend of EO. Propionate concentrations were not only found to be higher in EO-fed calves compared to controls ( < 0.05), but ruminal bacterial communities also differed greatly. For instance, the abundance of Firmicutes was significantly lower in samples from EO-fed calves than in controls, which appeared to be mostly due to lower Lachnospiraceae levels ( < 0.05). In contrast, Bacteriodetes were more abundant in EO-fed calves compared to controls, which was primarily the result of higher Prevotellaceae ( < 0.05). Notably, two bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were significantly more abundant in EO-fed calves; SD_Bt-00966 was found to be a close relative of  (97%), while SD_Bt-00978 likely corresponded to an uncharacterized species of Gammaproteobacteria. In addition, Pearson correlation and canonical correspondence analyses revealed potential associations between other ruminal bacterial OTUs and either short chain   () parameters or metrics for calf growth. Together, these results support that EO supplementation in growing dairy calves can modulate rumen function through  production and growth of specific rumen bacterial groups.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31204739>An easy access to topical gels of an anti-cancer prodrug (-fluorouracil acetic acid) for self-drug-delivery applications.</a></h1><p>An easy access to topical gels (both hydro- and organogels) derived from an anti-cancer prodrug namely -fluorouracil acetic acid (-FuA) achieved by exploiting a simple salt formation strategy is reported for the first time.

In Experiment 1, 90 pigs were fed NC or NC with 250 mg GSP/kg (GSP) or 400 mg betaine/kg [positive control (PC)] for 28 d. In Experiment 2, 30 pigs were fed NC, GSP, or GSP with antibiotics (GSP + Abx) diets for 14 d. In Experiment 3, pigs were fed NC, NC plus 1 g sodium propionate/kg (SP), or NC plus 1 g sodium butyrate/kg (SB) diet for 14 d. Serum biochemical indexes,  concentrations, and microbial composition were determined.In Experiment 1, compared with the GSP group, visceral adipocyte area was higher in the NC (28.6%) and PC (18.2%) groups (P ≤ 0.05). Colonic propionate and butyrate concentrations were 30.2% and 3.6% higher in the GSP group than in the NC group, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). In Experiment 2, compared with the GSP group, the NC group had a 108% higher Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio and had 50.4%, 61.2%, and 82.3% lower abundance of Akkermansia, Alistipes, and Bacteroides, respectively (P ≤ 0.05); antibiotics removed these effects of GSP. In Experiment 3, serum peptide YY was 19.% higher in the SP group than in the NC group (P ≤ 0.05), and it did not differ between the SB and NC groups (P > 0.05).GSP affected lipid metabolism in weaned pigs, which is associated with changed gut microbiota and enhanced microbial propionate production.

According to a 6 × 6 Latin square design, 6 rumen-fistulated second-lactation Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (97 ± 13 d in milk) were abomasally infused with saline (LMP-C); isoenergetic infusions (digestible energy basis) of 1,319 g/d glucose (LMP-GG), 676 g/d palm olein (LMP-LG), or 844 g/d essential AA (EAA; HMP-C); or isoenergetic infusions of 1,319 g/d glucose + 844 g/d EAA (HMP-GG) or 676 g/d palm olein + 844 g/d EAA (HMP-LG). Each experimental period consisted of  d of continuous infusion followed by 2 d of rest. A total mixed ration (42% corn silage, 31% grass silage, and 27% concentrate on a dry matter basis) formulated to meet 100 and 83% of net energy and metabolizable protein requirements, respectively, was fed at 90% of ad libitum intake by individual cow. Arterial and venous blood samples were collected on d  of each period. Infusing GG or LG at the HMP level did not affect milk yield or composition differently than at the LMP level. Neither GG nor LG infusion stimulated milk protein or lactose yield, but fat yield tended to decrease with GG and tended to increase with LG. Infusion of GG increased arterial plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin and decreased concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), nonesterified  , long-chain   (LCFA), total AA, EAA, and group 2 AA. Infusion of LG increased arterial triacylglycerides (TAG) and LCFA but did not affect EAA concentrations. Compared with the LMP level, the HMP level increased arterial concentrations of BHB, urea, and all EAA groups and decreased the concentration of total non-EAA. Mammary plasma flow increased with GG and was not affected by LG or protein level. Uptake and clearance of total EAA and group 2 AA were affected or tended to be affected by GG × AA interactions, with their uptakes being lower and their clearances higher with GG, but only at the LMP level. Infusion of LG did not affect uptake or clearance of any AA group. The HMP level increased uptake and decreased clearance of all EAA groups and decreased non-EAA uptake. Infusion of GG tended to increase mammary glucose uptake, and tended to decrease BHB uptake only at the LMP level. Infusion of LG increased mammary uptake of TAG and LCFA and increased or tended to increase clearance of TAG and LCFA. We suspect GG increased mammary plasma flow to maintain intramammary energy and AA balance and stimulated lipogenesis in adipose, accounting for depressed arterial BHB and group 2 AA concentrations. Mammary glucose uptake did not cover estimated requirements for lactose and fat synthesis at the HMP level, except during HMP-GG infusion. Results of this study illustrate flexibility in mammary metabolite utilization when absorptive supply of glucogenic, lipogenic, and aminogenic substrate is increased.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The offspring mice in both the modified group and conventional group exhibited autism-like behavioral abnormalities, including social disorder and repetitive stereotyped behavior ( &lt; 0.05).The mouse model of autism established using the modified method better mimics human autism with reduced mortality and abortion rates of the pregnant mice and also decreased mortality rate of the newborn mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587911>Persistence of differences between dairy cows categorized as low or high methane emitters, as estimated from milk mid-infrared spectra and measured by GreenFeed.</a></h1><p>Currently, various attempts are being made to implement breeding schemes aimed at producing low methane (CH) emitting cows. We investigated the persistence of differences in CH emission between groups of cows categorized as either low or high emitters over a -mo period. Two feeding regimens (pasture vs. indoors) were used. Early- to mid-lactation Holstein Friesian cows were categorized as low or high emitters (n = 10 each) retrospectively, using predictions from milk mid-infrared (MIR) spectra, before the start of the experiment. Data from MIR estimates and from measurements with the GreenFeed (GF; C-Lock Technology Inc., Rapid City, SD) system over the -mo experiment were combined into 7-, 14-, and 28-d periods. Feed intake, eating and ruminating behavior, and ruminal fluid traits were determined in two 7-d measurement periods in the grazing season. The CH emission data were analyzed using a split-plot ANOVA, and the repeatability of each of the applied methods for determining CH emission was calculated. Traits other than CH emission were analyzed for differences between low and high emitters using a linear mixed model. The initial category-dependent differences in daily CH production persisted over the subsequent  mo and across 2 feeding regimens with both methods. The repeatability analysis indicated that the biweekly milk control scheme, and even a monthly scheme as practiced on farms, might be sufficient for confirming category differences. However, the relationship between CH data estimated by MIR and measured with GF for individual cows was weak (R = 0.26). The categorization based on CH production also generated differences in CH emission per kilogram of milk; differentiation between cow categories was not persistent based on milk MIR spectra and GF. Compared with the high emitters, low emitters tended to show a lower acetate-to-propionate ratio in ruminal , whereas feed intake and ruminating time did not differ. Interestingly, the low emitters spent less time eating than the high emitters. In conclusion, the CH estimation from analyzing the milk MIR spectra is an appropriate proxy to form and regularly control categories of cows with different CH production levels. The categorization was also sufficient to secure similar and persistent differences in emission intensity when estimated by MIR spectra of the milk. Further studies are needed to determine whether MIR data from individual cows are sufficiently accurate for breeding.The Authors.

However, low concentrations of VFAs in water have prevented their commercial production, even with modern separation technologies, due to the high operating costs. We have applied newly developed solvents, selected by chemical structure similarity, to the separation of five different VFAs.Since most of the water was separated by extraction using hexyl acetate and nonyl acetate, the utilities necessary for solvent recovery and product purification were a fraction of those required by the existing VFAs' separation processes. The solvents separated almost all the water in the feed at the extraction stage, consuming no energy. The energy use in this study is only 34% of the lowest case use among various processes of either distillation-only or combined extraction-distillation.The performance evaluation of the proposed VFAs separation process showed that product recovery was 99% and acid purity was 99.% with eco-scores of 70% lower than those of the current processes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31426488>Enhancement of  Production from Food Waste by Mature Compost Addition.</a></h1><p>Food waste (FW) collected from a university canteen was treated in acidogenic fermenters to produce  (VFA) under biological pretreatment with mature compost. Batch assays working at pH 6 revealed an increment of 9.0%, 7.9%, and 4.1% (on COD basis) of VFA concentration when adding 2.%, 3.%, and 4.% / of mature compost, respectively, even though the  solids (VS) concentration of food waste was lower in the tests with increasing doses of mature compost. For batch tests at pH 7, this VFA generation improvement was lower, even though enhanced COD solubilization was recorded. Operating in semi-continuous conditions at 35 °C, pH of 6, and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3. days, the addition of 2.% / of mature compost led to a VFA concentration up to 51.2 ± 12.3% more (on VS basis) when compared to a reference reactor without compost addition. Moreover, the percentage of butyric acid on VS basis in the fermentation broth working at a pH of 6 increased from up to 12.2 ± 1.9% (0% compost addition) to up to 23. ± 2.7% (2.% compost addition). The VFA production was not improved when a higher percentage of mature compost was used (3.% instead of 2.% /), and it slightly decreased when mature compost addition was lowered to 1.% /. When working at a pH of 7 in the semi-continuous fermenters with the addition of 2.% / mature compost at an HRT of 3. days, an improvement of 79% and 104% of the VFA concentration (on VS basis) were recorded as compared to fermenters working at a pH of 6 with 2.% and 0% / of mature compost addition, respectively. At a pH of 7, higher production of propionic and valeric  was found with respect to the reactor working at a pH of 6. The effect of pH on VFA generation was estimated to have greater contribution than that of only biological pretreatment using mature compost. At a pH of 7, the VFA yield was higher for the fermenter working with 2.% / mature compost but at a pH of 7 and HRT of  days, the effect of mature compost on VFA production improvement was lower than that obtained at a pH of 6. Moreover, higher solubilization in terms of soluble chemical oxygen demand and total ammonium was detected when biological pretreatment using mature compost was applied at both a pH of 6 and a pH of 7, which indicates enhanced hydrolysis in both conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31514374>Effects of Phytonutrients on Ruminal Fermentation, Digestibility, and Microorganisms in Swamp Buffaloes.</a></h1><p>This experiment aimed to use dietary sources containing phytonutrients (PTN) such as mangosteen peel powder (MSP) and banana flower powder (BFP) as sources of phytonutrients. Four swamp buffalo bulls fitted with rumen fistulae were used as experimental animals. A digestion trial covering four periods was used according to a 4 × 4 Latin square design with four treatments: Treatment 1 (T1) = control (Cont), T2 = supplementation of PTN1 fed at 100 g/d, T3 = supplementation of PTN2 fed at 100 g/d, and T4 = supplementation of PTN3 fed at 100 g/d. The experiment was conducted for four periods; each period lasted for 21 days. All animals were fed a concentrate mixture at 0.% body weight, while rice straw, water, and mineral blocks were fed ad libitum. The findings revealed significant increases in the digestibility of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF), while no changes in dry matter feed consumption occurred due to PTN supplementation. Rumen fermentation end-products, such as total  (TVFA), propionic acid (C), and butyric acid (C), were notably enhanced ( < 0.05) and there were the highest in PTN2 and PTN3, whilst acetic acid (C) was significantly decreased with PTN supplementation groups. Furthermore, the rumen protozoal population was suppressed ( < 0.05), which resulted in decreased rumen methane production ( < 0.05), while the bacterial population was enhanced. Using PTN sources can improve rumen fermentation as well as mitigating rumen methane production.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31172562>Effect of adding crude glycerine to diets with feed additives on the feed intake, ruminal degradability,   acid concentrations and in vitro gas production of feedlot Nellore cattle.</a></h1><p>The effects of adding crude glycerine with sodium monensin or essential oils to beef cattle diets on the intake, degradability of DM and nutrients, rumen concentration of  (VFA) and in vitro gas production were evaluated. Five ruminally cannulated Nellore steers were randomly assigned to a  ×  Latin square design. The treatments were as follows: CONT, without crude glycerine and additives; EO, with essential oils and without crude glycerine; MON, with sodium monensin and without crude glycerine; EOG, with essential oils and crude glycerine; MONG, with sodium monensin and crude glycerine. Treatments with essential oil and sodium monensin increased the NDF and STC intake and the DM degradability. When crude glycerine was combined with either sodium monensin or essential oil, there was a reduction in DM, NDF and STC intake and an increase in DM and CP degradability of the diets. The adding crude glycerine to essential oil diets reduced the CH production. Sodium monensin treatments reduced DM and NDF intake and the production of total gas, CH , total VFA and acetic acid concentration. In conclusion, the adding crude glycerine (200 g/kg DM) with either sodium monensin (0.03 g/kg DM) or essential oil (0. g/kg DM) can be utilized in diets for Nellore cattle without causing detrimental effects on feed intake and improving the DM degradability.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31053976>Styrene, (+)-trans-(1R,4S,5S)-4-Thujanol and Oxygenated Monoterpenes Related to Host Stress Elicit Strong Electrophysiological Responses in the Bark Beetle Ips typographus.</a></h1><p>Bark beetles kill apparently vigorous conifers during epidemics by means of pheromone-mediated aggregation. During non-endemic conditions the beetles are limited to use trees with poor defense, like wind-thrown. To find olfactory cues that help beetles to distinguish between trees with strong or weak defense, we collected volatiles from the bark surface of healthy felled or standing Picea abies trees. Furthermore, living trees were treated with methyl jasmonate in order to induce defense responses. Volatiles were analyzed by combined gas chromatography and electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) on Ips typographus antennae. Compounds eliciting antennal responses were characterized by single sensillum recording for identification of specific olfactory sensory neurons (OSN). Release of monoterpene hydrocarbons decreased, while oxygenated compounds increased, from spring to early summer in felled trees. In both beetle sexes particular strong EAD activity was elicited by trace amounts of terpene alcohols and ketones. 4-Thujanol gave a very strong response and the absolute configuration of the tested natural product was assigned to be (+)-trans-(1R,4S,5S)-thujanol by stereoselective synthesis and enantioselective gas chromatography. One type of OSN responded to all ketones and five other OSN were characterized by the type of compounds that elicited responses. Three new OSN classes were found. Of the eight EAD-active compounds found in methyl jasmonate-treated bark, the known anti-attractant 1,8-cineole was the one most strongly induced. Our data support the hypothesis that highly active oxygenated host volatiles could serve as positive or negative cues for host selection in I. typographus and in other bark beetles.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31253064>Effects of branched-chain  and fibrolytic enzyme on rumen development in pre- and post-weaned Holstein dairy calves.</a></h1><p>The study evaluated the effects of branched-chain  (BCVFA) and fibrolytic enzyme (FE) on rumen development in calves. Forty Holstein male calves at the same ages (15 ± 2. days of age) and weights (45 ± 3.3 kg of body weight [BW]) were assigned randomly to four groups with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Supplemental BCVFA (0 g/d or 18 g/d) and FE (0 g/d or 1.83 g/d) were fed to calves. Data were analyzed as a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement random design by the mixed procedure of SAS. The BCVFA × FE interaction was observed for ruminal propionate, blood growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and GH receptor (GHR) and IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) expression in the rumen mucosa. Dry matter intake was higher for BCVFA addition. The higher average daily gain and ruminal  were observed for BCVFA or FE addition. Stomach weight and the length and width of rumen papillae were higher for BCVFA addition. The higher expression of GHR, IGF-1R and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1 in rumen mucosa, and blood GH and IGF-1 were observed with BCVFA or FE addition. Blood β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate were higher for BCVFA addition. The results indicated that rumen development was promoted by BCVFA, but was not affected with FE addition in calves.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31073330>Early warning indicators for mesophilic anaerobic digestion of corn stalk: a combined experimental and simulation approach.</a></h1><p>Monitoring and providing early warning are essential operations in the anaerobic digestion (AD) process. However, there are still several challenges for identifying the early warning indicators and their thresholds. One particular challenge is that proposed strategies are only valid under certain conditions. Another is the feasibility and universality of the detailed threshold values obtained from different AD systems. In this article, we report a novel strategy for identifying early warning indicators and defining threshold values via a combined experimental and simulation approach.The AD of corn stalk (CS) was conducted using mesophilic, completely stirred anaerobic reactors. Two overload modes (organic and hydraulic) and overload types (sudden and gradual) were applied in order to identify early warning indicators of the process and determine their threshold values. To verify the selection of experimental indicators, a combined experimental and simulation approach was adopted, using a modified anaerobic bioconversion mathematical model (BioModel). Results revealed that the model simulations agreed well with the experimental data. Furthermore, the ratio of intermediate alkalinity to bicarbonate alkalinity (IA/BA) and  (VFAs) were selected as the most potent early warning indicators, with warning times of 7 days and -8 days, respectively. In addition, IA, BA, and VFA/BA were identified as potential auxiliary indicators for diagnosing imbalances in the AD system. The relative variations for indicators based on that of steady state were observed instead of the absolute threshold values, which make the early warning more feasible and universal.The strategy of a combined approach presented that the model is promising tool for selecting and monitoring early warning indicators in various corn stalk AD scenarios. This study may offer insight into industrial application of early warning in AD system with mathematical model.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31213497>Treatment effects and comorbid diseases in 58 patients with visual snow.</a></h1><p>To evaluate pharmacologic treatment options for visual snow and to report prevalence of comorbid diseases.Medical charts of patients with a diagnosis of visual snow at the neurology outpatient clinic were reviewed on prescribed medication, and comorbid migraine, tinnitus, and psychiatric conditions including depression and anxiety.From 2007 to 2018, 58 patients were diagnosed with visual snow. Comorbid migraine was present in 51.7% of patients, lifetime depression in 41.4%, and lifetime anxiety in 44.8%. Lamotrigine was prescribed most frequently (26/58) and resulted in partial remission of symptoms in /26 (19.2%). No patients reported complete remission. Adverse events occurred in 13/26 (50.0%) patients. None of the other prescribed drugs (valproate [n = 7], topiramate [n = 4], acetazolamide [n = 2], flunarizine [n = 1]) led to improvement except for topiramate in one patient, who discontinued, however, because of adverse events.Of medication prescribed (lamotrigine, valproate, acetazolamide, flunarizine), only lamotrigine afforded some improvement in a small minority of patients. Migraine, depression, anxiety, and tinnitus were common comorbid diseases.This study provides Class IV evidence that for some patients with visual snow, lamotrigine resulted in partial remission of symptoms.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Two low- and high-tannin varieties were chosen, each in the form of dehulled and whole seed flours (DLT, DHT, WLT, and WHT, respectively). Pre-incubation time, fibre-extraction time, extraction temperature, and sample amount were evaluated during method optimization. The volatiles identified were classified into nine groups: aromatic hydrocarbons, aldehydes, alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ketones, organic , esters, and others. Significant differences between dehulled and whole samples were found. Volatiles derived from amino  were consistently observed in the  profile of all types. Despite the low lipid content of faba bean, significant amounts of volatiles normally associated with unsaturated   were present. HS-SPME/GC-MS proved to be a rapid, effective, and reproducible method (typical RSD < %) suitable for routine evaluation of faba bean  flavours.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We developed a HPLC method for the determination of SCFAs in mouse feces. After homogenization, the SCFAs in mouse feces and 2-ethylbutyric acid (internal standard) were derivatized with 2-nitrophenylhydrazine (2-NPH) in the presence of 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide. The 2-NPH derivatives of SCFAs and the internal standard were separated on a reversed-phase column (octadecyl silyl column) by gradient elution using phosphoric acid (pH 2.)-acetonitrile at 50°C and detected by absorbance measurement at 400 nm. The recovery of the method was 90-115%, with a precision (relative standard deviation) of 1.3-7.7%. The determination of SCFAs by the present method can provide useful information for biological and clinical research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31185060>Effects of BARLEYmax and high-β-glucan barley line on short-chain   production and microbiota from the cecum to the distal colon in rats.</a></h1><p>We investigated whether supplementation with the barley line BARLEYmax (Tantangara; BM), which contains three fermentable fibers (fructan, β-glucan, and resistant starch), modifies the microbiota in cecal and distal colonic digesta in addition to short-chain   (SCFAs) production more favorably than supplementation with a high-β-glucan barley line (BG012; BG). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 3 groups that were fed an AIN-93G-based diet that contained % fiber provided by cellulose (control), BM or BG. Four weeks after starting the respective diets, the animals were sacrificed and digesta from the cecum, proximal colon and distal colon were collected and the  concentrations were quantified. Microbiota in the cecal and distal colonic digesta were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. The concentrations of acetate and n-butyrate in cecal digesta were significantly higher in the BM and BG groups than in the control group, whereas the concentration of total SCFAs in cecal digesta was significantly higher only in the BM group than in the control group. The concentrations of acetate and total SCFAs in the distal colonic digesta were significantly higher only in the BM group than in the control group. The abundance of Bacteroidetes in cecal digesta was significantly higher in the BM group than in the control group. In contrast, the abundance of Firmicutes in cecal digesta was significantly lower in the BM and BG groups than in the control group. These results indicated that BM increased the concentration of total SCFAs in the distal colonic digesta. These changes might have been caused by fructan and resistant starch in addition to β-glucan. In conclusion, fermentable fibers in BM reached the distal colon and modified the microbiota, leading to an increase in the concentration of total SCFAs in the distal colonic digesta, more effectively compared with the high-β-glucan barley line (BG).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31250395>Modeling long-term performance of full-scale anaerobic expanded granular sludge bed reactor treating confectionery industry wastewater.</a></h1><p>Production and consumption of confectionery products, such as chocolate, sugar, and cookies, have increased worldwide. Thus, management and treatment of confectionery effluents, as one of the most important agro-industrial wastewaters, become essential. Confectionery industries produce high-strength and highly biodegradable wastewaters that are appropriate for biological treatment prior to discharge. In this study, long-term dynamic performance of a full-scale anaerobic expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactor treating confectionery effluent was simulated by using Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1). Substrate fractionation was carried out based on the ADM1 state variables, and then, the model was calibrated with 300 days of operation data. The calibrated model could capture the dynamic performance of the anaerobic reactor for a long validation period of 500 days. Although the reactor was operated under highly fluctuating volumetric loading rates (VLR) between 0.2 and  kg chemical oxygen demand (COD)/m day, the model results indicated medium to high prediction accuracy for effluent COD, methane generation, total  (VFA), and pH parameters. Mean relative absolute errors for COD, methane flow, VFA, and pH parameter simulations were 22%, 16%, 29%, and 1%, respectively.

Each diet group was divided into 70 Silkie hens experimentally. The production performance of silkie hens, the nutritional compositions [e.g., amino  (AAs) and  ] and flavour substances of silkie hens eggs were compared with control.A 0.3% and 0.% spirulina feeding significantly increased the average egg production rate and average egg weight, while only 0.3% spirulina feeding decreased both the average daily feed intake and feed conversion ratio of silkie hens compared with the controls (p < 0.05). The contents of crude protein, fat, cholesterol and Ca in silkie hens eggs were significantly increased by 0.3% spirulina feeding (p < 0.05). Only fat and cholesterol were significantly increased by 0.% spirulina but had no significant difference compared with 0.3% spirulina. The flavour, amino /total AAs, and saturated  /unsaturated   in silkie hens eggs were significantly increased by 0.3% spirulina feeding than other groups (p < 0.05).

This study aims to provide a wider perspective of the metabolic effect of OAF to test its potential as a strategy to address metabolic disorders of the transition period. A group of 10 Holstein dairy cows were divided into 2 groups: The treated group (IMS;  cows) received 32. g of OAF twice a day (65 g d) as top-dress in the morning and afternoon feeds from -55 to 42 days from calving (DFC), whereas the control group (CTR;  cows) received no supplementation. From -62 to 42 DFC, body condition score, body weight, dry matter intake, rumination time and milk yield were measured; blood samples were collected weekly to assess a wide hematochemical profile and to test white blood cell functions by  challenge assays. At 30 DFC, rumen fluid was collected and analyzed for pH,  composition, urea nitrogen, and lactate contents. Data were submitted to ANOVA using a mixed model for repeated measures, including treatment, time, and their interaction as fixed effects. OAF decreased blood nonesterified   and beta hydroxybutyrate concentrations and increased rumination time in early lactation. Leukocytes from IMS cows had lower lactate production and lower glucose consumption after  stimulation. OAF did not reduce the acute phase response indicators and reduced the blood concentrations of albumin and antioxidants after calving, suggesting impairment of hepatic functions related to protein synthesis and antioxidant management. Nevertheless, the lack of effect on bilirubin and liver enzymes refutes the possibility of severe liver damage occurring with OAF supplementation. Positive effects in reducing mobilization of body fats and ketogenesis and in increasing rumination time after calving suggest OAF effectiveness in preventing metabolic disorders of the transition period.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31548626>Continuous photoproduction of hydrocarbon drop-in fuel by microbial cell factories.</a></h1><p>Use of microbes to produce liquid transportation fuels is not yet economically viable. A key point to reduce production costs is the design a cell factory that combines the continuous production of drop-in fuel molecules with the ability to recover products from the cell culture at low cost. Medium-chain hydrocarbons seem ideal targets because they can be produced from abundant   and, due to their volatility, can be easily collected in gas phase. However, pathways used to produce hydrocarbons from   require two steps, low efficient enzymes and/or complex electron donors. Recently, a new hydrocarbon-forming route involving a single enzyme called  acid photodecarboxylase (FAP) was discovered in microalgae. Here, we show that in illuminated E. coli cultures coexpression of FAP and a medium-chain  acid thioesterase results in continuous release of  hydrocarbons. Maximum hydrocarbon productivity was reached under low/medium light while higher irradiance resulted in decreased amounts of FAP. It was also found that the production rate of hydrocarbons was constant for at least  days and that 30% of total hydrocarbons could be collected in the gas phase of the culture. This work thus demonstrates that the photochemistry of the FAP can be harnessed to design a simple cell factory that continuously produces hydrocarbons easy to recover and in pure form.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31025991>Supplementation with compound polysaccharides contributes to the development and metabolic activity of young rat intestinal microbiota.</a></h1><p>Dietary intervention during early life has a significant impact on colonization of the gut microbiota. In addition, some polysaccharides have the potential to selectively stimulate the growth and metabolic activity of intestinal bacteria associated with health and well-being. However, less is known about the effect of polysaccharides on the development of gut microbiota in younger individuals. This study was conducted to investigate the health effects of supplementation with dietary compound polysaccharides (Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP), Poria cocos polysaccharides (PCPs) and Lentinan, 1 : 1 : 1) on the intestinal microecosystem and metabolism of young rats. Male 21-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats received daily intragastric administration of either compound polysaccharides (three dosages, 6 g kg-1, 12 g kg-1 or 24 g kg-1) or saline for 28 consecutive days. 1H-NMR spectroscopy integrated with multi-variate pattern recognition analysis was applied to reveal the metabolism of the host and microflora, while 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to monitor the dynamic changes in the gut microbiota. The relative concentrations of 35 urinary metabolites and 24 faecal metabolites were significantly changed compared with the control group. 16S rRNA analysis showed that the relative abundances of 4 bacterial genera (Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Allobaculum and Oligella) significantly increased, whereas the relative abundance of 1 bacterial genus (Enterococcus) significantly declined in the compound polysaccharide-treated groups compared with the control group. Meanwhile, dietary compound polysaccharide treatment promoted the functional maturation of the gut bacterial community, characterised by increased basic metabolism (amino acid metabolism and energy metabolism), short chain  acid ()-related metabolism and nucleotide metabolism. These findings suggest that compound polysaccharides may help to promote the colonisation and functional maturation of infant intestinal microbiota and maintain the health of the intestinal microecosystem.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635264>Short Chain   and Fecal Microbiota Abundance in Humans with Obesity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h1><p>There have been mixed results regarding the relationship among short chain   (SCFAs), microbiota, and obesity in human studies. We selected studies that provided data on  levels or fecal microbiota abundance in obese and nonobese individuals and then combined the published estimates using a random-effects meta-analysis. Obese individuals had significantly higher fecal concentrations of acetate (SMD (standardized mean differences) = 0.87, 95% CI (confidence interva) = 0.24-1.50,  (-squared) = 88.), propionate (SMD = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.35-1.36,  = 82.3%), and butyrate (SMD = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.29-1.27,  = 81.7%) than nonobese controls. The subgroup analyses showed no evidence of heterogeneity among obese individuals with a BMI >30 kg/m ( = 0.0%). At the phylum level, the abundance of fecal microbiota was reduced in obese compared to nonobese individuals, but the difference was not statistically significant (Bacteroidetes phylum, SMD = -0.36, 95% CI = -0.73-0.01; Firmicutes phylum, SMD = -0.10, 95% CI = -0.31-0.10). The currently available human case-control studies show that obesity is associated with high levels of  but not gut microbiota richness at the phylum level. Additional well-designed studies with a considerable sample size are needed to clarify whether this association is causal, but it is also necessary to identify additional contributors to  production, absorption, and excretion in humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31282759>An overview of letermovir: a cytomegalovirus prophylactic option.</a></h1><p>: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) or human herpesvirus  (HHV-) is a β-herpesvirus that causes widespread infection in nearly all members of the human population worldwide. Its persistence in humans after primary infection in a latent phase as well as a partial non-protective immune response is the basis for repeated re-activation/re-infection episodes occurring both in immunocompetent and immunocompromised subjects. In the latter patient populations, which include hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, HCMV reactivation episodes may be particularly severe, leading to both systemic and end-organ diseases. Since the 90s, at least four antiviral drugs targeting the DNA polymerase complex have been developed for the prevention and treatment of HCMV infections in transplant recipients, used as first-line (ganciclovir and valganciclovir) and second-line therapy (foscarnet and cidofovir). However, due to their toxicity and drug-resistance induction, new drugs with different targets were needed. : In 2017, a new drug named letermovir (LTV), which targets the HCMV DNA terminase complex, was licensed for prophylaxis of HCMV infections in HSCT recipients. This is the focus of this review. : LTV safety and efficacy are promising. However, long-term adverse events and the emergence of drug-resistant HCMV strains must be investigated in extended clinical trials prior to drawing final conclusions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31203938>Characteristics of two-phase mesophilic anaerobic digestion of co-substrates consisting of waste activated sludge and corn silage based on modified ADM1.</a></h1><p>Two-phase anaerobic digestion of co-substrates is a promising process to alleviate environmental pollution, product valuable methane gas and renew energy. A modified anaerobic digestion model No. 1 (ADM1) was proposed to characterize the mesophilic two-phase anaerobic digestion at the feedstock ratios of waste activated sludge to corn silage 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, respectively. The sensitivity analysis of the modified ADM1 was operated on the platform AQUASIM 2.0 while the kinetic parameter estimation and simulation was implemented on the platform MATLAB 7.0. The Monod maximum specific uptake rate for acetate (k) was calibrated to 29.0 d, and the half-saturation value for acetate (k) 0.40 kgCOD/m in the acidification phase while k 35.0 d, Monod maximum specific uptake rate for hydrogen (k) 23.0 d and k 0.70 kgCOD/m in the methanogenic phase in the modified ADM1. The results from the batch tests showed the optimal feedstock ratio of waste activated sludge to corn silage was 2:1. Under this condition, chemical oxygen demand could reach the largest removal at around 51.0%, while Ammonia-nitrogen and total phosphorous increased by the maximal 192.0% and 71.%. Besides,  were lowest at about 0.27 kgCOD/m, and the biogas flow was highest at about 47.6 mL/d. The pH values were always maintained at 6.8-7.2. Good agreements could be achieved between the measured data and the simulation with the modified ADM1. Therefore, the optimal and preferable operating factors during two-phase anaerobic digestion of co-substrates could be obtained from the simulation. The modified model will contribute to further investigating and predicting the characteristics of the process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to screen  strains for their ZEN detoxification capability and use a fermentation process to validate their potential application in the feed industry. In the high-level ZEN-contaminated maize ( mg·kg) fermentation test, B2 strain exhibited the highest detoxification rate, removing 56% of the ZEN. However, B2 strain was not the strain with the highest ZEN detoxification in the culturing media. When B2 grew in TSB medium with ZEN, it had higher bacterial numbers, lactic acid, acetic acid, total , and ammonia nitrogen. The ZEN-contaminated maize fermented by B2 strain had better fermentation characteristics (lactic acid > 110 mmol·L; acetic acid < 20 mmol·L; pH < 4.) than ZEN-free maize. Furthermore, B2 also had detoxification capabilities toward aflatoxins B1, deoxynivalenol, fumonisin B1, and T2 toxin. Our study demonstrated differences in screening outcome between bacterial culturing conditions and the maize fermentation process. This is important for the feed industry to consider when choosing a proper method to screen candidate isolates for the pretreatment of ZEN-contaminated maize. It appears that using the fermentation process to address the ZEN-contaminated maize problem in animal feed is a reliable choice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31454583>Exploration of the reduction mechanism of Cr(VI) in anaerobic hydrogen fermenter.</a></h1><p>The bio-reduction of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) by anaerobic fermentation is considered as a promising, low-cost and environment-friendly way. However, it is unclear for the reduction mechanisms of Cr(VI) in an anaerobic hydrogen fermenter, such as reduction kinetics, related electron donors, migration and transformation, reduction site and key components, and related microorganisms. To clarify these issues, a hydrogen fermenter was designed to reduce Cr(VI) at 55 °C with glucose as initial substrate. Results show that 100 mg/L Cr(VI) can be completely reduced (99.%) to trivalent chromium (Cr(III) through chemical and biological reactions. Bio-reduction dominates Cr(VI) removal in a first-order exponential decay mode with both glucose and its metabolites () as electron donors. Moreover,  are more suitable as electron donors for Cr(VI) bio-reduction than glucose. Bacilli, Clostridia and Thermotogae in the fermenter dominated the reduction of Cr(VI) by regulating the production and composition of extracellular polymers (EPSs), in which carboxyl and hydroxyl groups play an important role for Cr(VI) reduction by coordination. The results can guide us to regulate the bio-reduction of Cr(VI), and provide reference for the development of bio-reduction technology of Cr(VI).Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We hypothesized that total fermentation but not the source (type) of FM would be the main factor in determining cellular /molecular outcomes in the healthy colon epithelia. The main aim of this study was to elucidate the role of two different sources of FM, fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and wheat bran (WB), on the expression of genes involved in short chain  acid () transport, G-protein signaling, apoptosis, cell proliferation and oncogenesis in colon epithelia of healthy rats. Male Fischer 344 rats (n = 10/group) were fed AIN-93G control (0% FM) or experimental diets containing WB (~1%, 2%, or % FM) or FOS (~2%, %, or 8% FM). Rats were killed after 6 weeks and the colon mucosa was assessed for the expression of target genes using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. By comparison to the control, dose-related changes of mRNA levels were found in rats fed FOS-based diets, including: (a) upregulation of three  transporters (Smct2, Mct1 and Mct4) but downregulation of Mct2, (b) upregulation of Gpr109a and downregulation of Gpr120, Gpr43, Gprc5a, Rgs2 and Rgs16, (c) upregulation of apoptosis-related genes including Bcl2, Bcl2-like 1, Bak1, Caspase 3, Caspase 8 and Caspase 9, (d) downregulation of the oncogenes and metastasis genes Ros1, Fos, Cd44, Fn1 and Plau, and (e) downregulation of several genes involved in cellular proliferation including Hbegf, Hoxb13, Cgref1, Wfdc1, Tgm3, Fgf7, Nov and Lumican. In contrast, rats fed WB-based diets resulted in dose-related upregulation of mRNA levels of Smct2, Rgs16, Gprc5a, Gpr109a, Bcl2-like 1, Caspase 8, and Fos. Additionally, different gene expression responses were observed in rats fed FOS and WB at 2% and % FM. Over all, these gene changes elicited by FOS and WB were independent of the expression of the tumor suppressor Tp53. These results suggest that fermentation alone is not the sole determinant of gene responses in the healthy rat colon.Crown Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the fermentation of protein is the rate-limiting step of VFA production with WAS as a substrate. In this study, the effect of redox mediators (RMs, i.e., riboflavin and lawsone) on the enhanced production of VFAs from WAS was investigated. The results indicate that both RMs can promote protein-dependent fermentation, increasing maximum VFA accumulation by 43.9% and 42.% respectively. In cultures supplemented with riboflavin and lawsone, VFA production was highly correlated with protease activities, but not with α-glucosidase activities. This implies that RMs affected the redox reaction of amino  degradation, resulting in an increased release of ammonia. Sequencing results showed that RMs significantly increased the abundance of bacteria related to VFA fermentation and protein/amino acid degradation at the levels of phylum, class, order, family, and even genus.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31537768>Implementing an Extended Kalman Filter for estimating nutrient composition in a sequential batch MBBR pilot plant.</a></h1><p>Online monitoring of water quality parameters can provide better control over various operations in wastewater treatment plants. However, a lack of physical online sensors, the high price of the available online water-quality analyzers, and the need for regular maintenance and calibration prevent frequent use of online monitoring. Soft-sensors are viable alternatives, with advantages in terms of price and flexibility in operation. As an example, this work presents the development, tuning, implementation, and validation of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) on a grey-box model to estimate the concentration of  (VFA), soluble phosphates (PO-P), ammonia nitrogen (NH-N) and nitrate nitrogen (NO-N) using simple and inexpensive sensors such as pH and dissolved oxygen (DO). The EKF is implemented in a sequential batch moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) pilot scale unit used for biological phosphorus removal from municipal wastewater. The grey-box model, used for soft sensing, was constructed by fitting the kinetic data from the pilot plant to a reduced order version of ASM2d model. The EKF is successfully validated against the standard laboratory measurements, which confirms its ability to estimate various states during the continuous operation of the pilot plant.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31354651>Bacterial Dynamics of Wheat Silage.</a></h1><p>Knowledge regarding bacterial dynamics during crop ensiling is important for understanding of the fermentation process and may facilitate the production of nutritious and stable silage. The objective of this study was to analyze the bacterial dynamics associated with whole crop wheat silage with and without inoculants. Whole crop wheat was ensiled in laboratory silos, with and without  inoculants (), for 3 months. Untreated and -treated silages were sampled at several times during ensiling, while -treated silage was sampled only at 3 months. Bacterial composition was studied using next generation sequencing approach. Dominant bacteria, before ensiling, were  (34.7%),  (28.4%) and  (10.4%),  (7.8%), and  (3.4%). Exogenous inoculants significantly affected bacterial composition and dynamics during ensiling. At 3 months of ensiling,  dominated the silage bacterial population and reached an abundance of 59., 92., and 98.2% in untreated, - and -treated silages, respectively. The bacterial diversity of the mature silage was lower in both treated silages compared to untreated silage. Functional profiling of the bacterial communities associated with the wheat ensiling demonstrated that the abundant pathways of membrane transporters, carbohydrate and amino  metabolisms followed different pattern of relative abundance in untreated and -treated silages. Only three pathways, namely base-excision repair, pyruvate metabolism and transcription machinery, were significantly different between untreated and -treated silages upon maturation. Lactic acid content was higher in treated silage compared to untreated and treated silage. Still, the pH of both treated silages was lower in the two -treated silages compared to untreated silage. Aerobic stability test demonstrated that -, but not -supplement, facilitated silage deterioration. The lower aerobic stability of the -treated silage may be attributed to lower content of acetic acid and other  which inhibit aerobic yeasts and molds. Indeed, high yeast count was recorded, following exposure to air, only in -treated silage, supporting this notion. Analysis of bacterial community of crop silage can be used for optimization of the ensiling process and the selection of appropriate inoculants for improving aerobic stability.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31004790>Effect of implantation site on outcome of tissue-engineered vascular grafts.</a></h1><p>Vascular prostheses for small caliber bypass grafts in cardiac and vascular diseases or for access surgery are still missing. Poly (Ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) has been previously investigated by our group and showed good biocompatibility and mechanical properties in vitro and rapid endothelialisation, cellular infiltration and vascularisation in vivo yielding optimal patency in the abdominal aortic position. The aim of the present study is to evaluate our PCL graft in the carotid position and to compare its outcome to the grafts implanted in the abdominal aortic position.PCL grafts (1 mm ID/10 mm long) were implanted into the left common carotid artery in 20 Sprague-Dawley rats and compared to our previously published series of abdominal aortic implants. The animals were followed up to 3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks. At each time point, in vivo compliance, angiography and histological examination with morphology were performed.PCL grafts showed good mechanical properties and ease of handling. The average graft compliance was 14. ± 1.7%/ mmHg compared to 7.8 ± 0.9% for the abdominal position and 45.1 ± 3.2%/ mmHg for the native carotid artery. The overall patency for the carotid position was 65% as compared to 100% in the abdominal position. Complete endothelialisation was achieved at 3 weeks and cell invasion was more rapid than in the aortic position. In contrast, intimal hyperplasia (IH) and vascular density were less pronounced than in the aortic position.Our PCL grafts in the carotid position were well endothelialised with early cellular infiltration, higher compliance, lower IH and calcification compared to the similar grafts implanted in the aortic position. However, there was a higher occlusion rate compared to our abdominal aorta series. Anatomical position, compliance mismatch, flow conditions may answer the difference in patency seen.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The results showed that OL, S/I ratio and initial pH significantly affected batch anaerobic process. Methane yield was proved to be inversely proportional to OL and S/I ratio. Digester with lowest OL ( g VS/L) obtained greatest methane yield (551.4 mL/g VS), highest organics removal (94.1%) and good stability. Enhancing OL to 10 g VS/L was recommended for satisfactory stability and higher volumetric methane productivity. When OL was designated as 10 g VS/L, digester with low S/I ratio (1/2) achieved satisfactory methane yield (539.3 mL/g VS), high organics removal (92.3%) and stable performance. When OL was relatively high (20 g VS/L), adjusting initial pH to 7. contributed to stable performance via enhancing buffering capacity against  (VFA) disturbance. Strong VFA inhibition occurred under high OL (40 g VS/L) or great S/I ratio (2/1) or acidic initial pH (6.). In this case, acetate was dominant VFA, followed by butyrate. However, when digester was stable, acetate was main VFA, followed by propionate. This study provided practical guidance on process configurations for batch digesters of food waste needed to achieve satisfactory performance and stability.Copyright © 2019 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

The  (VFA) changes in the feed and the temperature variation affected the dynamics of the PHA-accumulating bacteria over the plant operation. Remarkably, the higher PHA content was associated to a MMC largely comprising of Hydrogenophaga species during the operation at higher working temperature. The involvement of a heterogeneous PHA-accumulating MMC was associated with a high phaC synthase genes biodiversity confirming the occurrence of a functional redundancy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of fish peptides in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has not previously been investigated, hence this study aimed to evaluate the effect of a cod protein hydrolysate (CPH) supplement on symptom severity, gut integrity markers and fecal fermentation in IBS-patients. A double-blind, randomized parallel-intervention with six weeks of supplementation with 2. g CPH ( = 13) or placebo ( = 15) was conducted. The outcomes were evaluated at baseline and the end of the study. The primary outcomes were symptom severity evaluated by the IBS severity scoring system (IBS-SSS) and quality of life. The secondary outcomes included gut integrity markers and pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum, fecal fermentation measured by concentration of short-chain   (SCFAs) and fecal calprotectin. The groups were comparable at baseline. The total IBS-SSS-scores were reduced in both the CPH-group (298 ± 69 to 236 ± 106,  = 0.081) and the placebo-group (295 ± 107 to 202 ± 103,  = 0.005), but the end of study-scores did not differ ( = 0.395). The concentrations of serum markers and SCFAs did not change for any of the groups. The baseline measures for the whole group showed that the total  concentrations were inversely correlated with the total IBS-SSS-score ( = -0.527,  = 0.004). Our study showed that a low dose of CPH taken daily by IBS-patients for six weeks did not affect symptom severity, gut integrity markers or fecal fermentation when compared to the placebo group.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31377513>Enhanced butyrate production by transition metal particles during the food waste fermentation.</a></h1><p>Butyrate is an important precursor for fine chemicals and biofuels. The aim of this study is to investigate butyrate production as affected by transition metal addition of food waste fermentation including, nickel, Raney nickel and copper particles. Performance of fermentation showed nickel particles achieved the highest butyrate concentration, 7.3 g/L, which was 38.% higher than that in the control trial. Raney nickel also showed similar effect on the enhancement of butyrate production. However, increased dosage of transition metal particle addition led to decreased butyrate production. The theoretical link between metal-assisted dark fermentation and butyrate production was tentatively explored. Redox potential affected by nickel addition was assumed to be an essential factor for butyrate production. Microbial community analysis found Clostridium sensu stricto 11 may be the dominant functional species for butyrate production. The study demonstrates that development on transition metal catalyst may contribute to waste biorefinery for added value products/energy production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Methane emissions not only contribute to global warming, as it has 25 times the global warming potential (GWP) of CO, but also represent approximately 0.1~3.3% of digestive energy loss. Methanogens also play an important role in maintaining the balance of the gut microbiome. The large intestines are the main habitat for the microbiome in pigs. Thus, to better understand the mechanism of methane production and mitigation, generic-specific and physio-ecological characteristics (including redox potential (Eh), pH and  (VFAs)) and methanogens in the large intestine of pig were studied in this paper. Thirty DLY finishing pigs with the same diet and feeding conditions were selected for this experiment.A total of 219 clones were examined using the methyl coenzyme reductase subunit A gene (mcrA) and assigned to 43 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on a 97% species-level identity criterion. The family Methanobacteriaceae was the dominant methanogen in colonic digesta of finishing pigs, accounting for approximately 70.6% of the identified methanogens, and comprised mainly the genera Methanobrevibacter (57%) and Methanosphaera (14%). The order Methanomassiliicoccales, classified as an uncultured taxonomy, accounted for 15.07%. The methanogenic archaeon WGK1 and unclassified Methanomicrobiales belonging to the order of Methanomicrobiales accounted for 4.57 and 1.37%, respectively. The Eh was negative and within the range - 297.00~423.00 mV and the pH was within the range .04~6.97 in the large intestine. The populations of total methanogens and Methanobacteriales were stable in different parts of the large intestine according to real-time PCR.The major methanogen in the large intestine of finishing pigs was Methanobrevibacter. The seventh order Methanomassiliicoccales and species Methanosphaera stadtmanae present in the large intestine of pigs might contribute to the transfer of hydrogen and fewer methane emissions. The redox potential (Eh) was higher in the large intestine of finishing pigs, which had a positive correlation with the population of Methanobacteriale.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581791>Xylanase and xylo- oligosaccharide prebiotic improve the growth performance and concentration of potentially prebiotic oligosaccharides in the ileum of broiler chickens.</a></h1><p>1. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of supplementing broiler diets with xylanase or xylo- oligosaccharide (XOS) on growth performance, the concentration of non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) hydrolysis products in the ileum and concentration of short chain   () in the caeca of broiler chickens.2. In total, 500 male Ross 308 broilers were used in this 29-day (d) study. The treatments were organised into a 2 × 2 plus 1 factorial arrangement consisting of two additives (xylanase or XOS) at two levels (low or high) plus a control treatment with no additives. This gave five treatments with 100 birds in each treatment group. The diets were slightly deficient in protein by 20 g/kg and energy by 1 MJ/kg.3. On d 14 and 28, two birds per pen were euthanised, the caeca content collected and analysed for short chain  acid () concentration. On d 29, six birds per pen were euthanised and ileal digesta were collected and analysed for the concentration of NSP fractions.4. On d 14, caecal acetic acid, iso-butyric acid, iso-valeric acid, n-valeric acid and total  concentrations were significantly greater (P ≤ 0.05) when diets were supplemented with XOS compared with xylanase.. Ileal concentration of arabinose, galactose and glucuronic acid (GlucA2) were significantly greater (P ≤ 0.05) in the insoluble NSP fraction when diets were supplemented with a high level of xylanase, compared with the control treatment. Ileal concentration of fructose was significantly greater (P ≤ 0.05) in the water soluble NSP when a high level of xylanase or low level of XOS were included in the diet compared with the control.6. It was concluded that xylanase and XOS had similar effects on NSP concentration and  in the caeca, although there was little effect on performance. This observation demonstrated further benefits of xylanase supplementation in wheat-based broiler diets beyond digesta viscosity reduction and the release of extra nutrients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31217543>Propionic Acid Induces Gliosis and Neuro-inflammation through Modulation of PTEN/AKT Pathway in Autism Spectrum Disorder.</a></h1><p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by glia over-proliferation, neuro-inflammation, perturbed neural circuitry, and gastrointestinal symptoms. The role of gut dys-biosis in ASD is intriguing and should be elucidated. We investigated the effect of Propionic acid (PPA), a short-chain  acid () and a product of dys-biotic ASD gut, on human neural stem cells (hNSCs) proliferation, differentiation and inflammation. hNSCs proliferated to 66 neuropsheres when exposed to PPA versus 45 in control. The neurosphere diameter also increased at day 10 post PPA treatment to (Mean: 193.47 um ± SEM: 6.673 um) versus (154.16 um ± 9.95 um) in control, p < 0.001. Pre-treatment with β-HB,  receptor inhibitor, hindered neurosphere expansion (p < 0.001). While hNSCs spontaneously differentiated to (48.38% ± 6.08%) neurons (Tubulin-IIIβ positive) and (46.63% ± 2.%) glia (GFAP positive), PPA treatment drastically shifted differentiation to 80% GFAP cells (p < 0.05). Following 2 mM PPA exposure, TNF-α transcription increased 4.98 fold and the cytokine increased 3.29 fold compared to control (P < 0.001). Likewise, GPR41 (PPA receptor) and pro-survival p-Akt protein were elevated (p < 0.001). PTEN (Akt inhibitor) level decreased to (0.42 ug/ul ± 0.04 ug/ul) at 2 mM PPA compared to (0.83 ug/ul ± 0.09 ug/ul) in control (p < 0.001). PPA at 2 mM decreased neurite outgrowth to (80.70 um ± . um) compared to (194.93 um ± 19.7 um) in control. Clearly, the data supports a significant role for PPA in modulating hNSC patterning leading to gliosis, disturbed neuro-circuitry, and inflammatory response as seen in ASD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31027821> organic compounds (VOCs) produced by biocontrol yeasts.</a></h1><p>The  organic compounds (VOCs) produced by biocontrol yeast strains which belong to the Wickerhamomyces anomalus, Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Aureobasidium pullulans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae species were identified by solid phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Alcohols (ethyl alcohol, 3-methyl-1-butanol and phenylethyl alcohol) and esters (ethyl acetate and isoamyl acetate) were found to be the main VOCs emitted by the yeast strains, which had different production rate over a 16-day period. In addition, the tested yeast strains showed a remarkable ability to consume oxygen and to produce high percentages of carbon dioxide over a  days incubation period in a model system. The yeast strains, which were proven to very efficiently suppress in vivo the growth of postharvest fungal by VOCs, also quickly produced high percentages of ethyl acetate and carbon dioxide. . For all these reasons, we believe that the level of yeast biocontrol efficacy through the production of volatiles could be the result of a synergistic effect between VOCs and carbon dioxide in the packaging environment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Symptoms start around age 2, when children fail to maintain eye contact and to develop speech and other forms of communication. Disturbances in glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling that lead to synaptic changes and alter the balance between excitation and inhibition in the developing brain are consistently found in ASD. One of the hallmarks of these disorders is hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli; however, little is known about its underlying causes. Since the retina is the part of the CNS that converts light into a neuronal signal, we set out to study how it is affected in adolescent mice prenatally exposed to valproic acid (VPA), a useful tool to study ASD endophenotypes.Pregnant female mice received VPA (600 mg/kg, ) or saline at gestational day 11. Their male adolescent pups (P29-35) were behaviorally tested for anxiety and social interaction. Proteins known to be related with ASD were quantified and visualized in their retinas by immunoassays, and retinal function was assessed by full-field scotopic electroretinograms (ERGs).Early adolescent mice prenatally exposed to VPA displayed impaired social interest and increased anxiety-like behaviors consistent with an ASD phenotype. The expression of GABA, GAD, synapsin-1, and FMRP proteins were reduced in their retinas, while mGluR5 was increased. The a-wave amplitudes of VPA-exposed were smaller than those of CTR animals, whereas the b-wave and oscillatory potentials were normal.This study establishes that adolescent male mice of the VPA-induced ASD model have alterations in retinal function and protein expression compatible with those found in several brain areas of other autism models. These results support the view that synaptic disturbances with excitatory/inhibitory imbalance early in life are associated with ASD and point to the retina as a window to understand their subjacent mechanisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31111388>  acid production from mesophilic acidogenic fermentation of organic fraction of municipal solid waste and food waste under acidic and alkaline pH.</a></h1><p>This study is focused on the effects of pH on the production of  (VFAs) and their distribution through the acidogenic fermentation of source-sorted organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) from a mechanical-biological treatment (MBT) plant, and food waste (FW) from a university canteen. In semi-continuous lab-scale digesters using OFMSW at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3. days under acidic conditions (pH 6.0), the VFA concentration in the effluent increased to 9.8-11. g L (VS content of the feedstock between 4.2 and .2% w/w), while its individual VFA profiling was similar to the influent which was already pre-fermented (namely, C 35-41%, C 18-22%, C 17-21%, and C 9-12%). When working with the same conditions but using FW as feedstock, an effluent with a VFA concentration up to 11. g VFA L (FW with a VS content of .% w/w) and a stable distribution of C and C  (up to 60.3% and 12.9%, respectively) but with very low quantities of C and C  (lower than 1.8 and 2.7%, respectively) was obtained. Anaerobic batch tests using FW revealed that alkaline pH near 9 could lead to higher VFA production with high acetic acid content when compared to pH 6. In the semi-continuous fermenters working at alkaline conditions (pH 9.-10) using OFMSW and FW, an enhanced solubilization of organic matter was registered with respect to the fermenters working under acidic conditions. This fact was not reflected in a higher VFA production when using OFMSW as feedstock, probably due to free ammonia inhibition, since OFMSW was mixed in the MBT plant with supernatant from anaerobic digestion of this biowaste. However, when using FW, alkaline conditions lead to an enhanced VFA production with respect to the reactor working under acidic conditions, being acetic acid the predominant product, which represented up to 91% of the VFA spectrum obtained.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035409>Short Chain  Acid Biosynthesis in Microalgae  sp.

The results demonstrated that a total of 42 aroma compounds were identified in Beijing roasted duck, including aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, , phenols, sulfur-containing compounds, and nitrogen-containing compounds. Among the 42 aroma compounds, 18 were identified as important odorants with odor-activity values (OAVs) greater than 1. Aroma-recombination-omission experiments and sensory evaluation demonstrated that nine aroma compounds significantly contributed to the characteristic aroma of Beijing roasted duck. These nine key aroma compounds were 2-furfurylthiol, dimethyl trisulfide, hexanal, heptanal, octanal, nonanal, methional, 1-octen-3-ol, and ( E, E)-2,4-decadienal. Among these, 2-furfurylthiol (3620 ≤ OAV ≤ 31 606) and dimethyl trisulfide (2515 ≤ OAV ≤ 23 470) significantly contributed to the aroma of roasted duck ( p < 0.01). Sensory evaluation of the recombination model with the nine aroma compounds scored 4. out of  points. The major aroma profile of Beijing roasted duck included strong , roasty, and meaty aromas. The key aroma compounds of Beijing roasted duck were concluded to be 2-furfurylthiol, dimethyl trisulfide, hexanal, heptanal, octanal, nonanal, methional, 1-octen-3-ol, and ( E, E)-2,4-decadienal.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31104171>Removal of sulfamethoxazole antibiotic from aqueous solutions by silver@reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite.</a></h1><p>In the present study, the synthesizing of silver@reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite, through a facile precipitation method, is reported. In this method, in the synthesizing step, reduced graphene oxide was applied as a support, silver acetate as a precursor of Ag, and sodium hydroxide as a medium for reducing procedure. Then synthesized particles were characterized by using transmission electron microscopy analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray, and X-ray diffraction. Adsorbent potentials of the prepared nanocomposite were evaluated for sulfamethoxazole removal from polluted aqueous solutions via two different experimental methods, namely, "one-at-a-time" and "central composite design". The given results from the one-at-a-time method confirms that 0.007 g of silver@reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite can remove 88% (188.57 mg/g) of sulfamethoxazole from a 0.05 dm solution (initial concentration 30 mg/dm) at pH =  after 3600 s' contact time. However, in the central composite design method, the optimum condition was 95% (79.17 mg/g) uptake of this drug from 0.05 dm of polluted solution with initial concentration of 30 mg/dm and pH = 7., using 0.018 g of the adsorbent in 3600 s. The main mechanism for sulfamethoxazole removal can be suggested as a suitable interaction between S atoms in functional groups in the drug and Ag atoms on the surface of nanoparticles. The pseudo-second-order patterns and Freundlich model described the empirical data isotherm and kinetics for the adsorption processes, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity by experimental and theoretical isotherm methods (Langmuir) obtained 250 and 357 mg/g, respectively. Efficiency of the adsorbent in treatment of SMX from real samples displayed less hardness and electrical conductance samples have the maximum uptake percent while existence of nitrate ions in the solutions did not induce any negative effect on the removal of the SMX. All obtained results indicated loading of Ag nanoparticles on rGO nanosheets is an effective strategy for SMX uptake with high proficiency and shows great promise as pollutant adsorbent for environmental applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31170747>Evaluating Relationships between Visceral Fat Measures and Adipokines Concentrations among Women with a History of Preeclampsia.</a></h1><p> We sought to evaluate associations between postpartum plasma adipokine concentrations among women with a history of preeclampsia (PE) without severe features (MPE), PE with severe features (SPE), and no PE (NPE). We also investigated relationships between adipokines and computed tomography (CT)-quantified measures of visceral fat (VF) area (VFA) and subcutaneous fat area (). We performed a secondary analysis of data collected as part of a previously performed cross-sectional study at our institution.

Forty Holstein male calves (161 ± .7 days of age and 192 ± .4 kg of body weight) were assigned to one of four groups in a randomized experimental design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Moderate crude protein (130.1 g CP/kg [MCP] or high crude protein (150.2 g CP/kg [HCP]) diets were fed without (RPFA-) or with 3.6 mg FA (RPFA+) as RPFA per kg dietary dry matter (DM). Calves were fed a total mixed ration with a corn silage to concentrate ratio of 50:50 on a DM basis. The CP×RPFA interaction was not significant for any of the studied variables. The unchanged DM intake, higher average daily gain and lower feed conversion ratio were observed for HCP or RPFA+. Ruminal pH was lower, and total  (VFA) concentration was higher for HCP or RPFA+. Acetate proportion was higher, and propionate proportion was lower for HCP or RPFA+. As a result, the higher acetate to propionate ratio was observed. Ruminal ammonia N was higher for HCP, but was lower with RPFA supplementation. The higher digestibility of DM, OM, CP and NDF was observed. Blood glucose and insulin were unchanged, but albumin, total protein, GH and IGF-1 were higher. Similarly, the higher hepatic expression of GH, IGF-1, GHR, IGF-1R, PI3K, mTOR and P70S6K was observed for HCP or RPFA+. The results indicated that increasing dietary CP content or supplementation with RPFA promoted growth performance of calves by improving nutrient utilization and up-regulating hepatic expression of gene related to protein synthesis.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31151010>Accumulation of perfluoroalkyl substances in lysimeter-grown rice in Japan using tap water and simulated contaminated water.</a></h1><p>Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a group of contaminants of concern in agricultural crops, but little is known of their accumulation or behavior in grains.

A major retronasal burnt aroma region was purified by Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography and HPLC separation from the soy sauce aroma-type Baijiu sample. A novel retronasal burnt aroma compound was identified as 6-(2-formyl--methyl-1-pyrrol-1-yl)hexanoic acid () by means of high-resolution mass spectrometry and 1D/2D nuclear magnetic resonance. The retronasal burnt aroma threshold of compound  was determined to be 209. μg/L in 53% ethanol aqueous solution. Quantitative analysis showed that the concentration of compound  ranged from below the limit of quantitation (3.8 μg/L) to 224.2 μg/L in the Baijiu samples.

Alternative source of NPN is the slow release of ammonia sources in which the product is the extrusion of starch with urea. This work aimed to determine the effects on nutrient intake, ingestive behaviour, digestibility, nitrogen balance, ruminal pH, rumen ammonia nitrogen,  (VFA) and blood parameters with increased levels of extruded urea (50, 60, 70 and 80 g/100 kg of body weight [BW]) in beef cattle diet. Four rumen cannulated crossbred steers with initial mean weight of 336 ± 47 kg in a 4 × 4 Latin square design were distributed. Diets were formulated with 400:600 g/kg roughage:concentrate ratio on dry matter based and provided once per day, being used whole corn silage as roughage. There were no effects on nutrient intake (kg/day), ingestive behaviour, apparent digestibility, nitrogen balance,   acid (VFA) and blood parameters in extruded urea treatment groups. Similar results were observed on time spent on feeding, rumination and idleness. There were positive linear effects (p = 0.022) on rumen pH in the time of 8 hr after feeding and also on plasma concentration of the extruded urea levels (p = 0.039); whereas a linear negative effect (p = 0.030) was observed on ammonia nitrogen for the collection time of 2 hr after feeding. Increased levels of extruded urea could maintain nutrient intake, digestibility, ingestive behaviour, rumen pH and blood parameters in normal conditions. In conclusion, we recommend the extruded urea use with values up to 80 g/100 kg BW in confined beef cattle that receive balanced diets with 140 g/kg of crude protein.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627109>The role of a newly isolated strain Corynebacterium pollutisoli SPH6 in waste activated sludge alkaline fermentation.</a></h1><p>Alkaline fermentation has been considered as one of the efficient methods for waste activated sludge (WAS) treatment, but usually limited by microbial fermentation activities under extreme pH condition. One newly isolated alkali-tolerant strain Corynebacterium pollutisoli SPH6 was used to assess its potential role and effect on WAS alkaline fermentation process. Results from response surface method showed that the optimal organic nitrogen degradation rate by SPH6 was obtained under temperature of 35 °C, initial pH of 10, shaking speed of 80 rpm, inoculation ratio of 6.%. Batch-scale experiments demonstrated that, compared with the control group, the inoculation of SPH6 finally achieved higher productions with 13.4% of carbohydrates, 27.1% of protein and 25.4% of total  (VFAs), and more predominant functional bacteria characterized by high-throughput sequencing, such as genera Acinetobacter in phylum Proteobacteria, Tissierella and Acetoanaerobium in phylum Firmicutes. The strain SPH6 might play a vital role in maintaining and facilitating the growth and diversity of functional bacteria in WAS alkaline fermentation process.

Here, we used two 40-liter anaerobic reactors to deal with the actual organic fraction of municipal solid waste at OLRs of  and 7. kgVS/m/d and tried to inhibit bio-foam generation by dosing with Fe. One of reactors had 400 g of Fe added before operation and additional 200 g of Fe was added when the operating conditions changed; the other one was the control reactor with no Fe dosing. The results show that bio-foam was generated in the control reactor at an organic shock loading of 10 kgVS/m/d and re-startup at  kgVS/m/d, while the reactor containing Fe operated normally. Due to the surfactant attributes of  (VFAs), the probability of bio-foam generation was positively correlated with the effluent's degree of surface activity (SA) induced by VFAs, which is a parameter representing the foaming potential. Because VFA biodegradation was enhanced in the reactor with added Fe, at the position of Fe accumulation, the SA was decreased by 49.7-59.2%. Furthermore, the effect of Fe dosing on inhibiting bio-foam was evaluated by comparison with traditional commercial anti-foam agents. The results suggest possible reasons for bio-foam generation in OFMSW AD and suggest the reasonable usage of Fe to inhibit bio-foam formation.Copyright © 2019.

There are no effective methods including vaccines to prevent or control these diseases. Alternative methods should be employed, such as using novel immunostimulant poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB). The present study aimed to evaluate effects of dietary PHB supplementation on the growth, antioxidant enzymes activity, immune-related genes expression and intestinal microbiota in soiny mullet. The fish was fed for 30 or 60 days with six diets at different PHB supplementation of 0, 0., 1, 2, 4 and 8%, named as groups P0, P0., P1, P2, P4 and P8. The results showed that the weight gain and specific growth rate of fish in P2 and P0. groups were significantly higher than those in control P0 group at 30 and 60 days, respectively (P < 0.05). The antioxidant enzymes activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase in serum were significantly increased in P0./P1/P2 groups after 30 days. The transcriptional levels of penicillin-binding protein A and interleukin-8 analyzed by qRT-PCR were significantly upregulated in P2 and P4 groups compared to those in P0/P0./P1/P8 groups at 30 days. The transcriptional level of major histocompatibility complex class II in P2 group was significantly upregulated, and aldehyde oxidase downregulated compared to P0 group. Intestinal microbiota analysis by Illumina high-throughput sequencing showed that the microbiota diversity was not changed significantly, but the microbiota structure shifted significantly post PHB treatment. At the phyla level, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were predominant in both P0 and P2 groups. At the genus level, the relative abundance of Bacillus spp. in P2 group increased significantly, and abundance of Achromobacter spp. decreased significantly. KEGG pathway analysis by PICRUSt showed that oral administration PHB significantly upregulated abundances of genes responsible for 10 pathways and downregulated genes involved in 17 pathways. In conclusion, soiny mullet fed with 2% PHB supplemental diets for 30 days showed better growth performance, higher antioxidant enzymes activity and immune-related genes expression. Their regulation of growth and immunity might be related with the intestinal microbiota change post PHB supplementation. It will provide very useful basic information to study the regulation mechanism of PHB in aquatic animals, and provide good green method to prevent disease in soiny mullet.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Lithium is an effective maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder. It acts as mood stabiliser and reduces the risk of suicide. However, evidence assessing the efficacy of lithium in the treatment of acute mania is less robust. Current evidence-based guidelines cite multiple anti-dopaminergic and mood-stabilising agents as initial treatments: more definite evidence is needed to decide if lithium should be the first-line therapy.1. To assess the effects of lithium in comparison with placebo or other active treatment in alleviating the acute symptoms of a manic or mixed episode in people with bipolar disorder.2. To review the acceptability and tolerability of treatment with lithium in comparison with placebo or other active treatments in alleviating the acute symptoms of a manic or mixed episode in people with bipolar disorder.We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO. We also searched the World Health Organization trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews. We have incorporated studies from searches to 18 May 2018 into the current analyses.Prospective randomised controlled studies comparing lithium with placebo or alternative drug treatment in treatment of acute mania. We included anyone with bipolar disorder, male and female, of any age.At least two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality. We used odds ratios (ORs) to analyse binary efficacy outcomes, and mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuously distributed outcomes. We used a fixed-effect model unless heterogeneity was moderate or substantial, in which case we used a random-effects model. We used Review Manager  to analyse data. We assessed the certainty of evidence for individual outcomes using the GRADE approach.We found 36 randomised controlled studies comparing lithium with placebo, one of 12 drugs, or electroconvulsive therapy for treatment of acute mania. Studies included male and female participants (n = 4220), of all ages, who all fitted criteria for a manic episode within the context of a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.Risk of bias was variable; 12 studies had a high risk of bias in one domain and 27 gave inadequate information on randomisation leading to an 'unclear' rating for selection bias.Lithium versus placeboHigh-certainty evidence found that lithium was an effective treatment for acute mania and was more effective than placebo at inducing a response (OR 2.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.73 to 2.63; participants = 1707; studies = 6; I = 16%; high-certainty evidence), or remission (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.73 to 2.69; participants = 1597; studies = ; I = 21%; high-certainty evidence).Lithium was more likely than placebo to cause tremor (OR 3.25, 95% CI 2.10 to .04; participants = 1241; studies = 6; I = 0%; high-certainty evidence), and somnolence (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.46 to 3.58; participants = 1351; studies = 7; I = 0%; high-certainty evidence).There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of lithium for all-cause dropouts (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.25; participants = 1353; studies = 7; I = 75%; moderate-certainty evidence), and weight gain (OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.56 to 3.92; participants = 735, studies = 3; I= 51%; moderate-certainty evidence).Lithium versus antipsychotics or mood stabilisersFor the outcome of inducing a response, there was only very low-certainty evidence regarding lithium compared to haloperidol (MD -2.40, 95% CI -6.31 to 1.50; participants = 80; studies = 3; I = 95%), quetiapine (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.55; participants = 335; studies = 2; I = 71%), and carbamazepine (SMD 0.21, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.60; participants = 102; studies = 3; I = 0%).Lithium was probably less likely to induce a response than olanzapine (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.94; participants = 180; studies = 2; I = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence).Lithium may be less likely to induce a response than risperidone (MD 7.28, 95% CI .22 to 9.34; participants = 241; studies = 3; I = 49%; low-certainty evidence).There was no evidence of a difference between lithium and valproate (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.70; participants = 607; studies = ; I = 22%; moderate-certainty evidence).There was moderate-certainty evidence that lithium was more effective than topiramate at treating acute mania (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.63 to 3.20; participants = 660; studies = 1).Data on adverse events for these comparisons contained too few studies to provide high-certainty evidence.This systematic review indicates that lithium is more effective than placebo as a treatment for acute mania but increases the risk for somnolence and tremor. Limited evidence suggests little or no difference between lithium and other mood stabilisers (valproate, carbamazepine) or antipsychotics (risperidone, quetiapine, haloperidol). Olanzapine may be an exception, as it is probably slightly more effective than lithium. There is uncertain evidence that risperidone may also be more effective than lithium. Lithium is probably more effective at treating acute mania than topiramate. When compared to placebo, lithium was more likely to cause adverse events. However, when compared to other drugs, too few studies provided data on adverse effects to provide high-certainty evidence. More, rigorously designed, large-scale studies are needed to definitively conclude if lithium is superior to other interventions in treating acute mania.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088374>Comparative transcriptome analyses of genes involved in sulforaphane metabolism at different treatment in Chinese kale using full-length transcriptome sequencing.</a></h1><p>Sulforaphane is a natural isothiocyanate available from cruciferous vegetables with multiple characteristics including antioxidant, antitumor and anti-inflammatory effect. Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing has been used for long-read de novo assembly of plant genome. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism related to glucosinolates biosynthesis in Chinese kale using combined NGS and SMRT sequencing.SMRT sequencing produced 185,134 unigenes, higher than 129,325 in next-generation sequencing (NGS). NaCl (75 mM), methyl jasmonate (MeJA, 40 μM), selenate (Se, sodium selenite 100 μM), and brassinolide (BR, 1. μM) treatment induced 6893, 13,287, 13,659 and 11,041 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Chinese kale seedlings comparing with control. These genes were associated with pathways of glucosinolates biosynthesis, including phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, cysteine and methionine metabolism, and glucosinolate biosynthesis. We found NaCl decreased sulforaphane and glucosinolates (indolic and aliphatic) contents and downregulated expression of cytochrome P45083b1 (CYP83b1), S-alkyl-thiohydroximatelyase or carbon-sulfur lyase (SUR1) and UDP-glycosyltransferase 74B1 (UGT74b1). MeJA increased sulforaphane and glucosinolates contents and upregulated the expression of CYP83b1, SUR1 and UGT74b1; Se increased sulforaphane; BR increased expression of CYP83b1, SUR1 and UGT74b1, and increased glucosinolates contents. The desulfoglucosinolate sulfotransferases ST5a_b_c were decreased by all treatments.We confirmed that NaCl inhibited the biosynthesis of both indolic and aliphatic glucosinolates, while MeJA and BR increased them. MeJA and BR treatments, conferred the biosynthesis of glucosinolates, and Se and MeJA contributed to sulforaphane in Chinese kale via regulating the expression of CYP83b1, SUR1 and UGT74b1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31241125>Putrescine enhances intestinal immune function and regulates intestinal bacteria in weaning piglets.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to investigate the effect of putrescine on the immune function and intestinal bacteria of weaning piglets.

Firstly, the crotonase and 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase genes from Clostridium beijerinckii, and the thioesterase gene from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron were heterologously expressed in Y. lipolytica, the engineered strain LZJ001 accumulated 62.3 ± 4.2 mg/L of crotonic acid. Secondly, the acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was overexpressed, the derived recombinant strain LZJ002 produced 123. ± 6.8 mg/L of crotonic acid. Finally, the pyruvate dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli was additionally expressed, giving the fully engineered strain LZJ004 that produced 220.0 ± 8.2 mg/L of crotonic acid in shaking-flask culture, which represents a 3.-fold increase over LZJ001 strain.

However, the underlying mechanisms require further investigation.The aim of this study was to determine the role of butyrate, an , in the regulation of obesity, low-grade chronic inflammation, and alterations of microbiota composition in mice.Male C57BL/6J mice, 4- wk of age, were divided into 3 groups (n = 8 mice/group): low-fat diet (LFD; 10% energy from fat), high-fat diet (HFD; 45% energy from fat), or high-fat diet plus sodium butyrate (HSB). HSB mice received sodium butyrate at a concentration of 0.1 M in drinking water for 12 wk. Measures of inflammation, obesity, and intestinal integrity were assessed. Serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations were measured in the 3 groups. Fecal samples were collected for gut microbiota analysis.In HFD mice, body weight gain and hepatic triglyceride (TG), serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), and serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels were 1-4 times higher than those in LFD mice (P < 0.05); they were 34-42% lower in HSB mice compared with HFD mice (P < 0.05). The HFD group had 28%-48% lower mRNA expression of both Tjp1 and Ocln in the ileum and colon compared with levels in LFD or HSB mice (P < 0.05), whereas there was no difference in expression levels between LFD and HSB mice. Furthermore, in HSB mice, serum LPS concentration was 53% lower compared with that in HFD mice but still 23% higher than that in LFD mice (P < 0.05). Results from principal component analysis showed that HSB and LFD mice had a similar gut microbiota structure, which was significantly different from that in HFD mice (P < 0.05).Sodium butyrate administration beneficially changed HFD-induced gut microbiota composition and improved intestinal barrier, leading to lower serum LPS concentrations. These changes may correspond with improvements in obesity-related lipid accumulation and low-grade chronic inflammation.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109522>Comparison of liquid and dewatered digestate as inoculum for anaerobic digestion of organic solid wastes.</a></h1><p>In this study, the application of liquid and dewatered digestate was compared for the inoculation of the anaerobic digestion (AD) process. In addition to the specific methanogenic activity and biohydrogen potential tests, biochemical methane potential assay was also conducted using four different types of municipal and industrial waste streams (primary sludge, thickened waste activated sludge, source separated organics, and cattle manure). The specific methanogenic activity of the digestate cake (.0 ± 0. mL-CH/g-VSS.d) was higher than that of the liquid digestate (3.4 ± 0.2 mL-CH/g-VSS.d) for the food to microorganism ratio of 0.. The BMP results also revealed that regardless of the type of the substrate used, the application of the digestate cake as inoculum achieved statistically significantly higher methane production rate compared to the utilization of liquid digestate, most likely due to the lower concentration of dissolved contents (i.e., ammonia, soluble organic matter, heavy metals, etc.) in the diluted digestate cake. Despite the increased process rate, no statistically significant effect of the type of the inoculum was observed on the ultimate methane yield. The biohydrogen potential test revealed the similar performance of the digestate- and digestate cake-inoculated digesters in terms of biohydrogen and  production. The findings of this study suggest that the digestate cake can be used as an effective alternative to the liquid digestate for the inoculation of full-scale anaerobic digesters, reducing the transportation volume by up to 90%.Copyright © 2019.

Eighteen three-month-old Santa Ines castrated male lambs (16.9 ± 1.43 kg of body weight) were randomly distributed in two experimental treatments: Infected with T. colubriformis (I, n = 9) and Uninfected (U, n = 9). The I lambs received a total of 45,000 L larvae of T. colubriformis (,000 infective larvae, three times per week for three weeks). Daily feed intake was assessed using the I lambs as a reference for their respective pairs on the U group (pair-fed). Weight, body condition score and faeces (stool) samples were obtained every 15 days for 75 days. In both treatments, faecal egg count (FEC), digesta passage rate, rumen fermentation parameters, protozoa count and short chain   () were evaluated. The lambs presented moderate infection (FEC = 620). The retention time of the digesta in the rumen-reticulum segment was lower (P < 0.05) in I lambs. The I lambs presented no inappetence, however, lower concentrations of total  and butyrate, while higher acetate concentration were observed in these lambs (P < 0.05). The present findings highlight that T. colubriformis infection decreased the retention time (solid and liquid content) of the digesta in the rumen-reticulum, as well as negatively affected lamb growth.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about the long-term impact of O on the microbial communities. In the present study, two biofilters treating gaseous ethyl acetate were operated continuously for 230 days with inlet loads up to 180 g m∙h. A biofilter operated under continuous O addition (90 ppb) yielded consistently higher removal efficiency (RE) and elimination capacity (EC) compared to the control system. After 120 days of operation, a lower biomass content accompanied by a pH of 1. was observed in the ozonated biofilter, which was 2 units lower compared to the control reactor. Both reactors developed a distinct microbial community composition over the course of 230 days. The bacterial community was dominated in both biofilters by Beijerinckia and Gluconacetobacter, while Rhinocladiella similis, Trichosporon veenhuissi and Exophilia oligosperma were abundant in the fungal community. These findings suggest that ozonation of the biofiltration systems not only reduced clogging, but also contributed to the selection of biomass suitable for degradation of ethyl acetate.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The use of a large amount of NaOH in order to raise and buffer the low pH, is reported to be inhibitory to methanogens. In order to address this problem, we acclimatized aceticlastic methanogens to low pH. Methanogens were successfully acclimatized to initial low pH down to 3. in a lengthy, five months, acclimatization period. The aceticlastic methanogen, Methanothrix soehngenii which was 96.3% of the total methanogenic population at pH 4. and 86.75% at pH 3., demonstrated that they were the most tolerant aceticlastic methanogens to low pH. After acclimatization, methane yield at pH 4. was comparable to neutral pH. Methanosaeta maintained its dominance over Methanosarcina at an elevated level of acetate (66 mM), and a negative correlation was observed between them.

Coupling of magnetite (FeO) and zero valent iron (ZVI) was firstly used to enhance anaerobic digestion of phenol. The results indicated an obvious synergistic effect was generated with coupling of FeO and ZVI during the whole anaerobic digestion of phenol. The phenol degradation rate and methane production of FeO/ZVI-added group were increased by 8.8-23.1% and 11.9-31.6%, respectively compared with FeO-added group, and enhanced by .9-17.1% and 4.4-18.3%, respectively compared with ZVI-added group. ZVI improved the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens and FeO enhanced the growth of syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria.

In the autumn of 2015, the effect of methyl jasmonate (MJ) on the germination of triticale kernels and the development of triticale seedlings was analyzed in a laboratory before kernels were sown in experimental plots. Kernels harvested from plots in August 2016 were analyzed to determine their lipid and carbohydrate content and composition and the severity of fungal infections. Triticale grain was harvested at full maturity. The plots were sprayed with MJ at concentrations of 10 to 10 M in the stem elongation stage (200 L/ha) and in the early milk stage (300 L/ha). Other preventive treatments, fungicides, pesticides, or foliar fertilizers were not applied. Lipids of triticale kernels contained 20   (FAs) with the highest proportion of linoleic acid. Methyl jasmonate did not exert a significant effect on the FA composition of kernel lipids treated with the plant hormone during the growing season. Statistical analysis did not reveal significant ( p < 0.05) differences in the total content of soluble carbohydrates in control kernels and in the kernels collected from triticale plants treated with MJ. Methyl jasmonate applied at a concentration of 10 M in BBCH stages 54 and 73 reduced the prevalence of stem base, leaf, and spike diseases. However, the severity of grain infections caused by mycotoxin-producing fungi increased in treatments where MJ was applied at a concentration of 10 M relative to the control treatment.

In this paper, the sources, extraction, purification and structural characterization methods of natural polysaccharides are introduced. Natural polysaccharides are favorable for the proliferation of short chain  acid ()-producing bacteria, the presence of which can improve the intestinal microenvironment. Natural polysaccharides can not only enhance immunity, but also suppress excessive immune responses caused by various stimuli. In particular, natural polysaccharides can regulate immunity by acting directly on the immune cells and targeting the gut microbiota. Natural polysaccharides can enhance immunity by promoting beneficial microorganisms and strengthening the function of immune cells. However, natural polysaccharides can also suppress excessive inflammatory responses by improving the intestinal microbiota composition, strengthening intestinal barrier function, enhancing antioxidant activities, promoting  production and reducing pro-inflammatory mediators. Therefore, a comprehensive review is presented on the impacts of natural polysaccharides on the gut microbiota and immune responses, as well as their interactions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115287>Effects of increasing diet fermentability on intake, digestion, rumen fermentation, blood metabolites and milk production of heat-stressed dairy cows.</a></h1><p>Heat stress is a major problem for dairy cows in hot climates, thus coping strategies are essential. This study evaluated the effects of increasing diet fermentability on intake, total tract digestibility, ruminal pH and  (VFA) profile, blood metabolite profile and milk production and composition of lactating dairy cows managed under conditions of ambient heat stress. Nine multiparous cows (650 ± 56 kg BW; mean ± SD) averaging 102 ± 13 days in milk and producing 54 ± 6 kg/day were randomly assigned to a triplicate 3 × 3 Latin square. During each 21-day period, cows were offered one of three total mixed rations that varied in diet fermentability. The three levels of diet fermentability were achieved by increasing the proportion of pellets containing ground wheat and barley in the dietary DM from 11.7% (low), to 23.3% (moderate), and 35.0% (high) by replacing ground corn grain. Each period had 14 day of adaptation and 7 day of sampling. The ambient temperature-humidity index ( ≥ 72) indicated that the cows were in heat stress almost the entire duration of the study. Also, rectal temperature of cows was elevated at 39.2°C, another indication of heat stress. Increasing diet fermentability linearly decreased dry matter intake (22.8, 22., 21.8 kg/day for low, moderate and high, respectively; P ≤ 0.05) but increased non-fibre carbohydrate digestibility (P ≤ 0.05) and tended to increase digestibility of DM (P = 0.10) and crude protein (P = 0.06). As a result, the intake of digestible DM was not affected by the treatments. The production of 3.% fat corrected milk (32.6, 33.7, and 31. kg/day) was quadratically (P ≤ 0.05) affected by diet fermentability with lower production for the high diet compared with the other two, which were similar. Rumen pH (ruminocentesis) and proportions of butyrate and isovalerate linearly decreased whereas propionate proportion linearly increased with increasing diet fermentability (P ≤ 0.05). The rumen concentration of NH3-N (11.0, 9.0, and 8.7 mg/dL) and blood concentration of urea linearly decreased with increasing diet fermentability (P ≤ 0.05). The activity of alkaline phosphatase increased (65.1, 83.2, and 84.9 U/l) and concentration of malondialdehyde decreased (2.39, 1.90 and 1.87 µmol/l) linearly with increasing diet fermentability (P ≤ 0.05), which indicated possible attenuation of the effects of oxidative stress with increasing diet fermentability. Overall, a modest increase of diet fermentability improved nitrogen metabolism, milk protein production and oxidative stress of heat-stressed dairy cows, but a further increase in diet fermentability decreased milk yield.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31024714>Effect of clove () and seaweed () water extracts pretreatment on lipid oxidation in sun-dried sardines () from Lake Victoria, Tanzania.</a></h1><p>Small indigenous fish species play a significant role in food and nutritional security of poor communities in developing countries. Sardines () are fish species of Lake Victoria known to be a good source of health-promoting omega-3  . Open sun drying is a common and traditional sardine processing and preservation method. Sun-dried products suffer from characteristic off-flavor due to lipid oxidation which discourage product consumption and limit diversification. This study investigated the use of clove () and seaweed ( water extracts as natural antioxidants to impede lipid oxidation in sun-dried sardines. Lipid oxidation was assessed by peroxide value,  secondary oxidation products, and  acid profiles. The antioxidant capacity of extracts was evaluated by total phenolic content, 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, and iron (Fe) chelating ability. Results showed that , 10, and 20 g/L clove extracts significantly reduced peroxidation in sun-dried sardines by 38.7%, 54.6%, and 56%, respectively. Clove extracts resulted in higher retention of omega-3   and lower concentrations of secondary lipid oxidation products as opposed to seaweed counterpart.

The aim of this study was to evaluate how physical fibre properties influence the physical properties of gastrointestinal fluids using a gastrointestinal model (stomach, small intestine, ascending colon, transverse colon, and descending colon) (simgi®). Analysis by rheological and particle size characterisation, microbiota composition and short-chain  acid () determination allows the achievement of this goal. First, the water-holding capacity (WHC), microstructure, and viscosity of eight different fibres plus agar were tested. Based on the results, potato fibre, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), psyllium fibres, and agar (as a control) were selected for addition to a medium growth (GNMF) that was used to feed the stomach/small intestine and colon compartments in the simgi®. During gastrointestinal digestion, GNMF was collected at , 30 and 55 minutes of processing at the gastric stage and after the intestinal stage. Then, samples of GNMF with faecal slurry were collected at 0, 24 and 48 h of colonic fermentation. Results showed fibre-dependence on apparent viscosity. Although psyllium was partially broken down in the stomach (decrease in particle size), it was the most viscous at the colonic stage, opposite to the potato fibre, but both led to the highest total SFCA and acetic acid production profile. On a microbiological level, the most relevant increase of bacterial growth was observed in the faecal Lactobacillus species, especially for HPMC and potato fibre, that were not digested until reaching the colon. Besides fibre fermentability, viscosity also influenced microbial growth, and it is necessary to characterise these changes to understand fibre functionality.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662903>Are Nonnutritive Sweeteners Obesogenic?

The diet was assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire. One unit of NNSs was 100 mL beverage with NNSs or 2 tablets/teaspoons of NNSs. The faecal microbiota was assessed with GA-map® dysbiosis test and  with gas chromatography and flame ionisation detection. Fourteen men and 75 women with a mean age of 44.6 (SD 8.7) years, BMI 41.8 (SD 3.6) kg/m, and intake of NNSs 7. units/day (SD 3.2; range 0-43) were included. Faecal butyric acid was positively and negatively associated with the intake of starch (partial correlation = 0.264; =0.015) and NNSs (partial correlation = -0.274; =0.011), respectively. NNSs were associated with changes in four out of 39 bacterial groups. Butyric acid has antiobesogenic effects, reduces insulin resistance, and improves dyslipidaemia. Since the weight-reducing effect of NNSs on obese adults trying to lose weight is dubious, it seems imprudent to use NNSs that might counteract the favourable effects of butyric acid.Copyright © 2019 Per G.

Among the three VFAs, methanogenic degradation of propionate was the least feasible (57% lower specific methanogenic activity R and three times longer lag time λ than acetate degradation). At low ammonia concentration, only propionate showed improvement in R (46%) with supplementation of magnetite. In the ammonia-stressed condition without magnetite, R decreased by 38-58% and λ increased 2.2-8.8 times for all VFAs; magnetite supplementation significantly alleviated these effects. These results demonstrate that magnetite supplementation effectively increases methanogenic degradation of the VFAs even under ammonia-stressed conditions. 16S metagenomic sequencing revealed that distinctive methanogenic consortia were active in the different combinations of substrate, ammonia and magnetite. Alkaliphilus, Hyphomonadaceae SWB02 and Clostridia DTU014, Clostridia D8A-2, Christensenellaceae R-7 group and Rikenellaceae DMER64 were identified as potential syntrophic bacteria that can establish magnetite-mediated direct electron transfer with methanogens (Methanosaeta concilii, Methanosaeta harundinacea, Methanolinea tarda, Methanoculleus bourgensis and Methanosarcina spp.) during methanogenic degradation of VFAs.

However, a mutual dependence is developed between the host and symbiotic microbes, which has the potential to extract the energy present in these DF. Dietary fibers escape digestion in the foregut and are fermented in the hindgut, producing short-chain   () that alter the microbial ecology in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of pigs. Most of the carbohydrates are fermented in the proximal part, allowing protein fermentation in the distal part, resulting in colonic diseases. The structures of resistant starch (RS), arabinoxylan (AX), and β-glucan (βG) are complex; hence, makes their way into the hindgut where these are fermented and provide energy substrates for the colonic epithelial cells. Different microbes have different preferences of binding to different substrates. The RS, AX and βG act as a unique substrate for the microbes and modify the relative composition of the gut microbial community. The granule dimension and surface area of each substrate are different, which influences the penetration capacity of microbes. Arabinose and xylan are 2 different hemicelluloses, but arabinose is substituted on the xylan backbone and occurs in the form of AX. Fermentation of xylan produces butyrate primarily in the small intestine, whereas arabinose produces butyrate in the large intestine. Types of RS and forms of βG also exert beneficial effects by producing different metabolites and modulating the intestinal microbiota. Therefore, it is important to have information of different types of RS, AX and βG and their roles in microbial modulation to get the optimum benefits of fiber fermentation in the gut. This review provides relevant information on the similarities and differences that exist in the way RS, AX, and βG are fermented, and their positive and negative effects on  production and gut microbial ecology of pigs.

VFAs are considered an excellent carbon source for the biological nutrient removal (BNR) process. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in fermentation liquid is the direct substrate used for producing VFAs and can greatly influence the effluent quality of BNR process. However, knowledge of DOM characteristics in sludge alkaline fermentation is limited. This study focused on the functional groups, fluorescent components and molecular features of DOM as well as molecular weight of proteins in SS alkaline fermentation (at pH uncontrolled, 7, 8, 9 and 10). Results showed a significantly improved generation of tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like substances as well as molecular weight <1 kDa proteins (381. ± 38.4 mg/L) was observed at pH 10 (p < 0.05). Further analysis of DOM molecular characteristics indicated that pH 10 resulted in the highest molecular diversity and the generation or degradation of easily biodegradable lipid-like and proteins/amino sugars-like formulas. The improved solubilization of DOM contributed to VFAs production. Meanwhile, increasing pH to 10 also promoted the release of hard-biodegradable organic matter, e.g., humic-like and lignin-like substances. Additionally, a high diversity of resistant N-containing organic molecules was generated at pH 10. Fermentation of SS at pH 10, is favored to enhance VFAs production and, can also result in a higher content of refractory DOM. This study helps to achieve a comprehensive understanding of SS alkaline fermentation and provides fundamental information for further treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The abundance of gut microbiota in the high-fat model group was altered, and was associated with a decreased production of SCFAs. The microbiota abundance of the baicalin group was closer to that of the control group, increasing the population of -producing bacteria spp and improving metabolic syndrome, including abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism caused by a high-fat diet. Baicalin may improve abnormalities in glycolipid metabolism by affecting the production of SCFAs.Copyright © 2019.

Microbial load of slices treated with DBD-HVCAP were lower than the control. The efficacy of bacteria reduction by DBD-HVCAP was dependent on the treatment times (P < 0.05). Total viable bacteria count (TVBC) was more than 6.0 Log CFU/g at day 6 for the control kept in air. Slices treated with DBD-HVCAP for all treatment times used had TVBC lower than the limit at day 12. Total  nitrogen base content (TVNB) as well as trimethylamine (TMA) content in slices treated with DBD-HVCAP were lower than that of the control throughout the storage. TVNB as well as TMA contents were lower in HVCAP treated slices in a treatment time-dependent manner. Nevertheless, lipid oxidation in samples treated with DBD-HVCAP was higher than that of the control. Polyunsaturated   were decreased in slices treated with DBD-HVCAP for more than  min after 12 days of storage. Therefore DBD-HVCAP treatment for  min was demonstrated to be potential means for increasing the shelf-life of Asian sea bass slices with minimal negative effect on chemical and sensory properties, in which they could be stored longer than 12 days at 4 °C. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Microbial inactivation capacity of dielectric barrier discharge high-voltage cold atmospheric plasma (DBD-HVCAP) has been documented with limited information on its application in extending the shelf-life of foods. DBD-HVCAP was demonstrated as an innovative technology for extending the shelf-life of Asian sea bass slices, which could be implemented in seafood industries for assuring safety and extending shelf-life of products. The shelf-life of the slices treated with DBD-HVCAP was extended to 12 days of storage at 4 °C as compared to the 6 days of the untreated counterpart.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31160023>Optimization of urban waste fermentation for  production.</a></h1><p>The problem of waste disposal has recently focused on practices for waste recycling and bio-resources valorization. Organic waste produced in urban context together with biological sludge produced in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) can be used as renewable feedstock for the production of building blocks of different products, from biopolymers to methyl esters. This paper deals with the optimization of the fermentation process in order to transform urban organic waste (a mixture of pre-treated food waste and biological sludge) into added-value   acid (VFA) rich stream, useful for biological processes within a biorefinery technology chain. Different temperatures, pH, hydraulic retention times (HRTs) and organic loading rates (OLRs) were tested both in batch and continuous trials. Batch tests showed the best working conditions at 37 °C and pH 9, using the bio-waste feedstock thermally pre-treated (76 h at 72 °C). These conditions were applied in continuous process, where higher HRT (6.0 d) and lower OLR [7.7 kg VS/(m d)] gave the best performances in terms of process yield and maximum VFA level achieved: 0.77 COD/VS and 39 g COD/L. An optimized fermentation process is crucial in a biorefinery perspective since it has to give a final stream of constant composition or tailored products suitable for further applications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The two reactors were operated for 60 days with an influent PO-P concentration of 2. mg·L. The phosphorus removal performance, sludge production, and changes in the microbial community structure of the systems were analyzed. The results indicated that both SBR systems showed good performance of phosphorus and organic matter removal. However, microorganisms in both systems showed glycogen-accumulating metabolism properties under long-term Poly-P deficiency. In the unfavorable environment of long-term Poly-P deficiency,  Ⅰ maintained a high abundance (40%±7%) in the propionate SBR system, indicating that  Ⅰ had higher metabolic activity and its metabolic properties could be independent of Poly-P for survival under Poly-P deficiency for a long period. In comparison, propionate is more conducive to  adaptation to lower phosphorus loads, and  Ⅰ is more competitive than  Ⅱ under lower phosphorus loads.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31061301>[Valproic acid-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy in a patient receiving valproic acid monotherapy].</a></h1><p>A 79-year-old female was diagnosed with epilepsy because she experienced loss of consciousness twice in January and February and then had a seizure in June 2016.

RD is a by-product of abattoir; it is a partially digested feed that mainly originates from rumen of ruminants. RD consisted of 13.-46.1% crude protein and some essential nutrients (microbial cells, amino , minerals, and  [VFAs]), which beneficially affect the ruminant production. Recent studies have shown that transfer of RD from buffalo to cattle improved nutrient digestibility. Ensiling RD with agro-industrial by-products improved the nutritional value of agro-industrial by-products, such as by improving protein contents and increasing their digestibility. In addition, dried RD could enhance ruminal fermentation, diet utilization, and rumen microorganisms in in vitro, beef cattle and buffalo, which has no adverse effect on production performance. Therefore, utilization of RD is suggested because it improves nutrient utilization, reduces feed costs, and controls waste disposal to the environment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31472405>Essential regulators of iron chemical speciation distributions in anaerobic digestion of pretreated food waste: Organic  or inorganic acid radicals?</a></h1><p>In this work, a 30-days batched mesophilic assay on pretreated food waste (PFW) under different inoculum/substrate (I/S) ratios (1:, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 4:1 and 1:0) was carried out, to target the most important parameters in AD matrix on regulating iron (Fe) chemical speciation. Correlation coefficients were calculated within four Fe chemical forms and AD parameters of pH,  (VFAs), inorganic acid radicals (IARs), and alkalinity. Results showed that IARs were not key factors on regulating Fe speciation. Without acidification, IARs showed weak correlations (coefficients < 0.40) with Fe chemical dynamics while other parameters showed stronger correlations (coefficients ≥ 0.60). Under acidification, VFAs initiated the conversion of exchangeable Fe into water soluble fraction. Residual fraction might play important role in regulating Fe shifting to more bioavailable states.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, quality deterioration, or more specifically, a faded aroma occurs in long-term cold-stored fruits. To understand the implicit mechanism, we analyzed the change in content of the main aroma esters and   by chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and the expression patterns of the main genes in  acid metabolism pathways. The results showed that hexyl hexanoate disappeared completely and the content of five other aromas declined significantly in cold-stored fruit during the optimal taste period. The content of saturated and unsaturated   significantly increased and decreased, respectively in cold-stored fruit. fadD, fadE, fadJ, atoB, fabF, SCD, FAD2, LOX2S, LOX1_ and HPL genes down-regulated in  acid metabolism during shelf life in the fruit after cold storage. In conclusion, the faded aroma of cold-stored fruit was mainly regulated by  acid metabolism pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

GSE61260 chip was downloaded from the public microarray database and liver biopsy samples from 24 NASH cases and 38 healthy controls were included. The Limma software package in R language was used to screen DEGs under the condition of difference multiple > 1. and adj.  < 0.05. The clusterProfiler software package was used for GO analysis and KEGG analysis. The STRING online database was used for protein-protein interaction analysis, and the L1000 and DrugBank databases were used for drug prediction.  Compared with healthy control group, 857 DEGs were screened out in NASH group including 167 up-regulated genes and 690 down-regulated genes. GO analysis showed that DEGs were mainly involved in inflammation and cholesterol metabolism. KEGG analysis showed that DEGs were mainly enriched in PPAR, non-alcoholic  liver disease, oxidative phosphorylation and other signaling pathways. Among them, eight genes of ACSL4, CYP7A1, FABP4, FABP5, lipoprotein lipase, ME1, OLR1 and PLIN1 were enriched in PPAR signaling pathway, and 165 interaction nodes were formed with 47 DEGs-encoded proteins. Lipoprotein lipase interacted with 21 DEGs, and its up-regulated expression had improved lipid metabolism, insulin resistance and anti-inflammatory effects. Four drugs (gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, omega-3 carboxylic acid and glycyrrhizic acid) were screened by L1000 and DrugBank to activate lipoprotein lipase. Presently, these four drugs are clinically used to treat hypertriglyceridemia or to improve inflammation. In this regard, we speculated that the pharmacological effects of these four drugs had improved NASH by activating lipoprotein lipase to promote liver lipid metabolism and alleviate inflammation.  PPAR signaling pathway is closely associated to the occurrence and development of NASH, and thereby lipoprotein lipase agonist is a new attempt to treat NASH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189087>Agave salmiana fructans as gut health promoters: Prebiotic activity and inflammatory response in Wistar healthy rats.</a></h1><p>Prebiotic effects of Agave salmiana fructans at five different doses were evaluated by the growth of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Clostridium strains and  production in the cecum and proximal colon of healthy Wistar rats. Mucosal integrity, bacterial proliferation, and inflammatory response were also examined. Growth of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains was improved by 12.% doses of fructans in both cecum and proximal colon tissues, and a significant decrease of Clostridium (P < 0.05) was observed. Increases in mucosal thickness, proliferation, and cell adhesion were mainly observed in the cecum. High concentration of butyric acid and total  were contained in the 12.% doses. This study provides direct evidence of the prebiotic effects of Agave salmiana fructans, demonstrating that a diet supplemented with a 12.% dose of fructans promotes major growth of probiotic bacteria and could be used as a potential prebiotic ingredient under the conditions used in this study. Taken together, these results further indicate the significance of Agave salmiana fructans as a prebiotic ingredient in the regulation and prevention of gastrointestinal diseases, as well as for the design of functional foods.Copyright © 2019.

Selected binary combinations of lactobacilli strains were recently successfully used to inhibit Penicillium commune and Mucor racemosus in four dairy products. Our aim was to identify the compounds most likely involved in their antifungal activity. Four chromatographic methods, targeting 56 antifungal compounds as well as volatiles, were combined. Overall, 53 antifungal compounds were detected, of which 33 were in significantly higher amounts in at least one product inoculated with an antifungal culture compared to the controls. They were present at concentrations below their MIC and thus could act in synergy. Among them, the most commonly identified were acetic, hydroxyphenyllactic, phenyllactic, 3-phenylpropanoic, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic and -oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic , diacetyl, acetoin, and an unidentified .

Four treatments for each diet were evaluated in an  batch culture system over 24 h: (1) control with no addition of substrates; (2) 4 g YSP/l; (3)  g IN/l; (4) 4 g YSP/l in combination with  g IN/l of faecal culture of dogs fed Diet L or H. Several changes in fermentation metabolites were analysed. Samples incubated with the faecal inocula of dogs fed Diet L produced higher concentrations of total , propionate ( = 0.001), acetate ( ≤ 0.001), d-lactate ( = 0.041) and indole ( = 0.003), whereas pH ( = 0.004) was decreased. Supplementation of IN increased the content of putrescine, d- and l-lactate, total , acetate, propionate, -butyrate ( ≤ 0.001) and -valerate ( = 0.003), while -valerate, indole and pH ( ≤ 0.001) were reduced. Ammonia was lower ( = 0.013) in samples with faecal inocula from dogs fed Diet H and further reduced by the addition of IN ( ≤ 0.001). Samples with faecal inocula from dogs fed Diet L had a fewer quotient of ammonia and total  ( = 0.040). Supplementation of YSP ( = 0.021), IN ( ≤ 0.001) and YSP in combination with IN ( = 0.047) led to a higher reduction of the quotient of ammonia and total .

The results revealed that RL could decrease the adhesion force of EPS from 13.46 nN to 1.08 nN, resulting in EPS disintegration layer by layer, decreasing the median particle size by 31.57 μm and releasing abundant soluble organic matter. The cell number of living bacteria remained stable after RL pretreatment (2.59 × 10 vs. 2.66 × 10), indicating that RL has a minimal impact on microbial cells (only ~2% bacterial lysis was observed). The kinetic studies of ammonia nitrogen release and  production suggested that, in the RL-pretreated WAS, the reaction rate constants for hydrolysis and acidogenesis were respectively 2-fold and 1.-fold higher than those of the control group.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we investigated the effects of prebiotics on growth performance, intestinal microbiota, short-chain   (SCFAs) production and immune response of the marine fish, juvenile chu's croaker (Nibea coibor). The fish were fed IG (including 0.% inulin and 0.% GOS), GS (0.% GOS and 0.% D-sorbitol), IGS (0.33% inulin, 0.33% GOS and 0.33% D-sorbitol) or control diets for 8 weeks. The results showed that the growth performance of the fish was promoted by IG and GS, but not by IGS. The intestinal microbiota in NDC (non-digestible carbohydrates, NDC)-supplemented groups was clearly separated from that of the control, and the highest Shannon and Simpson diversity indices were observed in the IGS group. In the intestine of the croaker, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes were dominant; among them, 24 taxa revealed a significant difference among groups. Most of these bacteria are able to produce SCFAs, which were significantly increased in all NDC-supplemented groups. Moreover, NDCs were found to activate the immune system of the fish by modulating the serum complements, cytokine levels, lysozyme activities and antioxidant capacity. Furthermore, the results of this study revealed correlations among intestinal microbiota, SCFAs production, innate immunity, antioxidant capacity and digestive enzymes in the croaker fed NDCs. Taken together, our results demonstrated that NDC mixtures might promote growth performance, antioxidant capacity and immune responses of the croaker through modulating the composition of intestinal microbiota and the subsequent SCFAs production, which suggest that NDCs were efficient feed additives for marine fish.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Seventy-two 21-d-old pigs were fed a plain diet (CTR) or supplemented with sodium butyrate (BUT) or sodium heptanoate (HPT), both at 0.3%. After a week of adaptation, animals were orally challenged at days 8 and 9 with .8 · 10 and 6.6 · 10 cfu, respectively, and were euthanised on d 4 and d 8 post-inoculation (PI) ( = 8) to collect blood, digesta and tissue samples and characterise microbial groups, pathogen loads (qPCR), fermentation, ileal histomorphometry and immune markers. Colonic microbiota was analysed by 16S rRNA gene MiSeq sequencing. Supplementing both acid salts did not compensate clinical challenge effects nor performance impairments and neither histomorphometry nor serum biomarkers. Changes in the gastric fermentative activity were registered, BUT reducing lactic acid concentrations (day 8 PI), and with HPT fewer animals presenting detectable concentrations of propionic, butyric and valeric . At ileum BUT increased acetic acid concentration (day 8 PI), and both additives reduced short-chain   () in the colon. Increases in enterobacteria and coliforms counts in ileal digesta (day 4 PI,  < 0.10) and mucosa scrapes ( < 0.05) were registered although  F4 gene copies were unaffected. Regarding changes in the colonic microbiota (day 4 PI), Prevotellaceae and  were promoted with BUT supplementation whereas only minor groups were modified in HPT-treated animals. Summarising, although the pathogen loads or inflammatory mediators remained unresponsive, butyrate and heptanoate showed a significant impact on microbial fermentation along the whole GIT, being able to modify different bacterial groups at the colon. It could be hypothesised that these effects might be mediated by a carry-over effect of the changes observed in gastric fermentation, but possibly also to a better nutrient digestion in the foregut as a result of the reduced colonic  concentrations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31401358>Solventogenesis in Clostridium aceticum producing high concentrations of ethanol from syngas.</a></h1><p>The ethanol production capability of Clostridium aceticum was investigated and optimized, in order to evaluate the ability of that organism to produce high concentrations of fuel-ethanol. The results showed that C. aceticum can produce significant amounts of ethanol when a natural pH drop occurs in the fermentation broth as a consequence of acetic acid production in a first stage. Applying different pH-regulating strategies allowed to optimize ethanol production, which proved to be more efficient in case of natural acidification due to acetic acid, reaching up to .6 g/L ethanol, compared to artificial pH adjustment through the addition of hydrogen chloride. Playing with the pH value and the bioreactor operating conditions showed that, under specific conditions, C. aceticum is able to perform the reverse reaction as well and convert ethanol, produced at low pH, back to acetic acid, impeding, under those specific conditions, further accumulation of ethanol in the fermentation broth.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, transcriptomics and metabolite analyses were carried out to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of 1-MCP on peach aroma from different standpoints:  acid (FA) metabolism, ethylene signal transduction and lipoxygenase/β-oxidation pathway during 20 °C storage. Results indicate that 1-MCP significantly postponed the ethylene climacteric peak appearance and reduced ethylene production through down-regulation of related biosynthesis and signal transduction genes including PpaSAMS1/2, PpaACS1/2, PpaACO1 together with PpaETR1/2, PpaERS1, PpaEIN4 and PpaCTR1. Decrease in the levels of FAs and PpaFADs was observed in treated fruit, except oleic acid and PpaFAD4/, before day  of storage. In addition, 1-MCP-treated fruit also possessed higher levels of C6 aldehydes and alcohols and delayed the formation of  compounds characteristic of peach-like aroma by upregulation of PpaLOX1/2/3 and PpaHPL1 expression and down-regulation of PpaLOX5 expression. Our findings suggest that inhibition of peach-like volatiles and promotion of green-note volatiles by 1-MCP were associated with ethylene production and modulation of FA levels through transcriptional regulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this work was to develop a microbial process for xylitol production using sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate as substrate. In this context, 218 non-Saccharomyces yeast strains were screened by growth on steam-exploded sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate containing a high concentration of acetic acid (8.0 g/L). Seven new Candida tropicalis strains were selected and identified, and their ability to produce xylitol on hydrolysate at low pH (4.6) under aerobic conditions was evaluated. The most efficient strain, designated C. tropicalis JA2, was capable of producing xylitol with a yield of 0.47 g/g of consumed xylose. To improve xylitol production by C. tropicalis JA2, a series of experimental procedures were employed to optimize pH and temperature conditions, as well as nutrient source, and initial xylose and inoculum concentrations. C. tropicalis JA2 was able to produce 109. g/L of xylitol with a yield of 0.86 g/g of consumed xylose, and with a productivity of 2.81 g·L·h, on sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate containing 8.0 g/L acetic acid and177 g/L xylose, supplemented with 2.0 g/L yeast nitrogen base and 4.0 g/L urea. Thus, it was possible to identify a new C. tropicalis strain and to optimize the xylitol production process using sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate as a substrate.

With this in mind, raw milk from an individual farm was transformed under controlled conditions at a dairy pilot plant. The production technology included the partial skimming of the evening and morning milk mixture by cream surfacing and the addition of a natural whey starter cultures (NWSC) prepared with four selected Streptococcus thermophilus strains (PON6, PON244, PON261 e PON413). Ten microbial groups were investigated by plate counts from raw milk until ripened cheeses. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were in the range 10-10 CFU/ml before NWSC addition. After curdling, this group increased by 3 log cycles and was counted at 10 CFU/g after curd cooking. A rapid pH drop (to 6.05) was registered after almost 3 h from NWSC addition. The levels of members of the Enterobacteriaceae family were at about 10 CFU/ml in raw milk and decreased after curd cooking to 1 log cycle. A similar behavior was shown by the other undesired microbial groups and a complete disappearance of staphylococci was registered. The microbiological counts of 9-month ripened cheeses showed the dominance of LAB and undetectable levels of the undesired bacteria. MiSeq Illumina was applied to better investigate the bacterial composition of ripened cheeses and this technique evidenced that the majority of OTUs belonged to Lactobacillus and Streptococcus genera. The final cheeses were characterized by 67.65% dry matter of which 41.85% of fats and 47.02% of proteins. The main cheese   were palmitic, oleic and myristic  and the saturated  /unsaturated   ratio was 2.17.

It has been suggested that weight loss may affect  metabolism, but a systematic review of intervention studies is lacking. We aimed to systematically assess the effects of dietary, physical activity-based, and surgical weight-loss interventions among overweight [body mass index (BMI) 25-29.9 kg/m2)] or obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) adults (≥18 y) on concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate, and total SCFAs in blood, urine, or feces. We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to April 30, 2018 for randomized and nonrandomized weight-loss trials among overweight or obese adults, in which the concentrations of individual and total SCFAs were assessed. A total of 9 studies consisting of 2 randomized parallel-arm trials, 4 crossover trials, and 3 nonrandomized clinical or surgical trials were included. In the majority of studies, changes in fecal  concentrations were assessed, whereas changes in serum SCFAs were reported from 1 trial. Individual and total  concentrations either remained unchanged or decreased significantly following weight loss. Three of the dietary interventions that resulted in decreased  concentrations were low (≤% of energy) in total carbohydrates. Most of the studies had a high risk of bias. Decreases in  concentrations may accompany weight loss induced by bariatric surgery or dietary restriction among overweight or obese adults, particularly when carbohydrate intake is reduced. However, findings were inconsistent and based on studies with high to unclear risk of bias, and small sample sizes. Because measurements of fecal SCFAs may not be ideal due to limited sample standardization, well-powered trials with repeated blood measurements of SCFAs are required.

Although metabolic adaptations of the adipose tissue are critical for a successful transition, beyond lipolysis, alterations within adipose tissue during ketosis are not well known. The objective of this study was to investigate the adipose tissue proteome of healthy or ketotic postpartum cows to gain insights into biological adaptations that may contribute to disease outcomes. Adipose tissue biopsy was collected on  healthy and  ketotic cows at 17 (±4) d postpartum and ketosis was defined according to the clinical symptoms and serum β-hydroxybutyrate concentration. Morphology micrographs stained by hematoxylin-eosin showed that adipocytes were smaller in ketotic cows than in healthy cows. The isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification was applied to quantitatively identify differentially expressed proteins (DEP) in the adipose tissue. We identified a total of 924 proteins, 81 of which were differentially expressed between ketotic and healthy cows (P < 0.05 and fold changes >1. or <0.67). These DEP included enzymes and proteins associated with various carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism processes. The top pathways differing between ketosis and control cows were glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, glucagon signaling pathway, cysteine and methionine metabolism, biosynthesis of amino , and the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. The identified DEP were further validated by western blot and co-immunoprecipitation assay. Key enzymes associated with carbohydrate metabolism such as pyruvate kinase 2, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit α), lactate dehydrogenase A , phosphoglucomutase 1, and 6-phosphofructokinase 1 were upregulated in ketotic cows. The expression and phosphorylation state of critical regulators of lipolysis such as perilipin-1 and hormone-sensitive lipase were also upregulated in ketotic cows. Furthermore, key proteins involved in maintaining innate immune response such as lipopolysaccharide binding protein and regakine-1 were downregulated in ketotic cows. Overall, data indicate that ketotic cows during the transition period have altered carbohydrate, lipid metabolism, and impaired immune function in the adipose tissue. This proteomics analysis in adipose tissue of ketotic cows identified several pathways and proteins that are components of the adaptation to ketosis.© The Author(s) 2019.

There is concern that the diet could exacerbate inflammation by modifying microbiota and short-chain  acid () production. We examined the effect of altering dietary FODMAP content on inflammation in preclinical inflammatory models.C57BL/6 mice were given 3% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water for  days and recovered for 3 weeks (postinflammatory, n = 12), or  days (positive-control, n = 12). Following recovery, DSS-treated or control mice (negative-control, n = 12) were randomized to 2-week low- (0.51 g/100 g total FODMAP) or high-FODMAP (4.10 g) diets. Diets mimicked human consumption containing fructose, sorbitol, galacto-oligosaccharide, and fructan. Colons were assessed for myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and histological damage. Supernatants were generated for perforated patch-clamp recordings and cytokine measurement. Cecum contents were analyzed for microbiota, , and branched-chain   (BCFA). Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni.Inflammatory markers were higher in the positive-control compared with negative-control and postinflammatory groups, but no differences occurred between the two diets within each treatment (MPO P > .99, histological scores P > .99, cytokines P > .05), or the perforated patch-clamp recordings (P > .05). Microbiota clustered mainly based on DSS exposure. No difference in  content occurred. Higher total BCFA occurred with the low-FODMAP diet in positive-control (P < .01) and postinflammatory groups (P < .01).In this preclinical study, reducing dietary FODMAPs did not exacerbate nor mitigate inflammation. Microbiota profile changes were largely driven by inflammation rather than diet. Low FODMAP intake caused a shift toward proteolytic fermentation following inflammation.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056708>Impact of weaning age on rumen development in artificially reared lambs1.</a></h1><p>This study examined the impact of weaning age (4 vs. 6 wk) on rumen morphological and metabolic development in artificially reared lambs. Thirty-two mixed-sex lambs (2 to  d old) were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 weaning groups: early weaning (EW; 4 wk) and control (Ctrl; 6 wk). Lambs were individually penned and fed milk replacer (MR; 24% CP and 25% fat, DM basis) at 20% of their corresponding initial BW. Weaning was achieved by gradual reduction of MR allowance over a period of 3 wk using a step-down procedure. Concentrate and meadow hay were offered ad libitum from 1 d of the study until 6 wk, when lambs were transferred to a mixed sward pasture. At week 4, individual DMI were recorded and blood samples collected to measure β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) and NEFA. Eight animals per group were euthanized at week 4 and 16 to evaluate short chain   () and histomorphometry of the rumen walls: dorsal (DS), ventral (VS), dorsal blind (DBS), and ventral blind (VBS) sacs. Linear mixed models were used to analyze the effect of weaning treatments at week 4 and 16, and to compare between timepoints and between rumen sites. Dry matter intake and rumen  profiles were similar between groups (P > 0.10) at week 4 and 16. Plasma concentrations of BHBA were greater (P = 0.03) in EW than in Ctrl lambs, while NEFA did not differ (P > 0.10) between groups at week 4. No effect of weaning age on rumen empty weight, and papillae density, length, width, surface area ratio, and muscle layer thickness at any of the 4 rumen sites was found (P > 0.10) at either week 4 or week 16, except for greater (P = 0.02) papillae epithelium thickness in the DBS at week 4 in EW than Ctrl lambs. Papillae morphology and muscular thickness differed across rumen sites at week 4 and week 16 (P < 0.05), except for papillae density and surface area ratio at 4 week (P > 0.10). Rumen papillae length, width, and muscle layer thickness increased while papillae density and surface area ratio decreased (P < 0.05) between 4 and 16 wk. The results of this study indicate that morphological and physiological development of the rumen can be accelerated to support weaning of artificially reared lambs at 4 wk, using a step-down weaning system. Morphological differences between rumen sacs denote that future studies in lambs evaluating the impact of different diets should involve representative sampling across the rumen rather than a single site to more accurately study rumen development and ontogenic changes.© The Author(s) 2019.

Cablin patchouli herb (CPH), Atractylodes rhizome (AR), Amur Cork-tree (AC) and Cypsum were mixed with the weight ratios of 1:1:1:0. and 1:1:1:1 to make up TCMC1 and TCMC2, respectively. Both TCMC were added at level of 25 g/kg of substrate dry matter.  gas production was recorded and methane concentration was determined at 12 and 24 h of incubation. After 24 h, the incubation was terminated and the inoculants were measured for pH, ammonia nitrogen,  (VFA). Total deoxyribonucleic acid of ruminal microbes was extracted from the inocula, and populations were determined by a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Populations of total rumen methanogens, protozoa, total fungi, ,  and  were expressed as a proportion of total rumen bacterial 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid. Compared with the control, the 2 TCMC decreased ( ≤ 0.05) total VFA concentration, acetate molar proportion, acetate to propionate ratio, gas and methane productions at 12 and 24 h, hydrogen (H) produced and consumed, and methanogens and total fungi populations, while the 2 TCMC increased ( ≤ 0.05) propionate molar proportion. Traditional Chinese medicine compound 1 also decreased ( ≤ 0.05)  population. From the present study, it is inferred that there is an effect of the TCMC in suppressing methanogenesis, probably mediated via indirect mode by channeling H utilized for methanogenesis to synthesis of propionate and direct action against the rumen microbes involved in methane formation. In addition, the relative methane reduction potential (RMRP) of TCMC2 was superior to that of TCMC1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31214795>Improvement of the aroma of lily rice wine by using aroma-producing yeast strain Wickerhamomyces anomalus HN006.</a></h1><p>A fruity aroma-producing yeast strain was isolated with the aim of improving the aroma of fermented lily rice wine, and identified as Wickerhamomyces anomalus HN006. In addition, the effects of adding solid residues of previous fermentation cycles, and of fungus α-amylase and W. anomalus HN006 supplementation on the biochemical parameters of lily rice wine were evaluated. The optimum quality of the wine, in terms of ethanol and residual sugar content, acidity levels and aroma, was obtained with % (w/v) solid residue addition, and supplementation with 10 U/g fungal α-amylase and 2% (v/v) W. anomalus inoculum on the 4th day of fermentation.  compound profiles, the total amount of amino  and the sensory characteristics of the lily rice wines produced by the two fermentation processes were also evaluated and compared. The lily rice wine obtained from our optimized experimental technology produced higher amounts of some esters, free  , alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, alkenes,  phenol and thiazole, in addition to higher total amino acid content and sensory scores compared to the traditionally brewed wine. Our process resulted in an intensification and improvement of lily rice wine aroma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31085223>Twenty-eight-day repeated oral doses of sodium valproic acid increases neural stem cells and suppresses differentiation of granule cell lineages in adult hippocampal neurogenesis of postpubertal rats.</a></h1><p>Developmental exposure to valproic acid (VPA), a model compound for experimental autism, has shown to primarily target GABAergic interneuron subpopulations in hippocampal neurogenesis of rat offspring. The VPA-exposed animals had revealed late effects on granule cell lineages, involving progenitor cell proliferation and synaptic plasticity. To investigate the possibility whether hippocampal neurogenesis in postpubertal rats in a protocol of 28-day repeated exposure is affected in relation with the property of a developmental neurotoxicant by developmental exposure, VPA was orally administered to -week-old male rats at 0, 200, 800 and 900 mg/kg body weight/day for 28 days. At 900 mg/kg, GFAP cells increased in number, but DCX cells decreased in number in the granule cell lineages. Moreover, CHRNB2 cells and NeuN postmitotic neurons decreased in number in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. Transcript level examined at 900 mg/kg in the dentate gyrus was increased with Kit, but decreased with Dpsyl3, Btg2, Pvalb and Chrnb2. These results suggest that VPA increased type-1 stem cells in relation to the activation of SCF-KIT signaling and suppression of BTG2-mediated antiproliferative effect on stem cells. VPA also decreased type-3 progenitor cells and immature granule cells probably in relation with PVALB interneuron hypofunction and reduced CHRNB2 interneuron subpopulation in the hilus, as well as with suppression of BTG2-mediated terminal differentiation of progenitor cells. Thus, the disruption pattern of VPA by postpubertal exposure was different from developmental exposure. However, disruption itself can be detected, suggesting availability of hippocampal neurogenesis in detecting developmental neurotoxicants in a 28-day toxicity study.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Twenty-four Holstein calves (2 d old) in hutches were used in a 12-wk randomized complete block design study. Calves were blocked by birth date and sex. Treatments were (1) control (CON) with no supplement and (2) 50 g/d of CWS. Preweaning CWS was fed with milk and postweaning CWS was top-dressed on starter pellets. Calves were fed 2.83 L of pasteurized milk 2×/d during wk 1 to , 1×/d in wk 6, and weaned at d 42. Calves had ad libitum access to starter pellets and water. Individual intakes of milk and starter pellets were measured daily. Fecal scores (0 = firm, 3 = watery) and respiratory scores (healthy ≤3, sick ≥), calculated from the sum of scores for rectal temperature, cough, ocular, and nasal discharge, were recorded daily. Body weights (BW), frame growth, and jugular blood samples were taken once every week at 3 h after the morning feeding. Fecal grab samples were collected in wk 12 for analysis of apparent total-tract digestibility. Data were analyzed using MIXED procedures of SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with repeated measures. Total dry matter intake was greater in calves fed CWS compared with CON. Calves fed CWS tended to have greater BW during the postweaning period. Gain:feed, average daily gains, withers heights, and concentrations of plasma urea nitrogen were not different. Concentrations of plasma β-hydroxybutyrate were greater in calves fed CWS compared with CON. Serum glucose concentrations were greater in calves fed CON during the preweaning stage, but similar concentrations were found between treatments during the postweaning stage. Rumen pH, ammonia-N, and total  were similar between treatments. The acetate:propionate ratio was greater in calves fed CWS. The apparent total-tract digestion of nutrients was similar; however, CON tended to have greater digestion of neutral detergent fiber. Fecal scores were not different, but a treatment by week interaction was observed. Supplementing CWS improved starter intake, postweaning BW, β-hydroxybutyrate, fecal scores, and maintained frame growth.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Twenty-eight uncastrated, crossbreed lambs with an average initial weight of 22.6 ± 2.37 kg were used in the experiment. The treatments consisted of a standard diet (control) containing buffelgrass and spineless cactus and three diets containing cactus as the only roughage source plus varied concentrations of WB (30, 37, and 44%, on a dry matter basis). Results were evaluated by analysis of variance, and contrasts were applied at the % probability level for mean comparison. Rumen villus height and width were greater and musculature was lower in the lamb fed diets containing 37% and 44% WB compared with those fed control diet. In the intestine, the crypts were smaller in the animals which consumed the diets with 30, 44, and 37% WB. All WB levels resulted in lower nitrogen intake and retention. Microbial protein concentration, microbial protein efficiency, microbial nitrogen, urea, and glucose were not significantly affected. Feeding lamb with diets containing levels of wheat bran, with cactus as the only roughage source, does not negatively affect their ruminal-fermentation, blood, and urinary characteristics; ammoniacal nitrogen concentration; pH; or microbial protein. However, nitrogen balance and ruminal and intestinal morphometric characteristics are impaired.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31475535>High-Level Production of 4-Hydroxyvalerate from Levulinic Acid via Whole-Cell Biotransformation Decoupled from Cell Metabolism.</a></h1><p>γ-Hydroxyvalerate (4HV) is an important monomer used to produce various valuable polymers and products. In this study, an engineered 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase that can convert levulinic acid (LA) into 4HV was co-expressed with a cofactor (NADH) regeneration system mediated by an NAD-dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH) in the  strain, MG1655.

Placenta from obese mothers showed blood vessel immaturity, hypoxia, increased transcript levels of inflammation, autophagy and altered levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers. These data suggest that maternal intestinal changes probably contribute to adverse placental adaptations and also impart an increased risk of obesity in the offspring via alterations in fetal gut development.Shifts in maternal intestinal microbiota have been implicated in metabolic adaptations to pregnancy. In the present study, we generated cohorts of female C57BL/6J mice fed a control (17% kcal fat, n = 10-14) or a high-fat diet (HFD 60% kcal from fat, n = 10-14; ad libitum) aiming to investigate the impact on the maternal gut microbiota, intestinal inflammation and gut barrier integrity, placental inflammation and fetal intestinal development at embryonic day 18.. HFD was associated with decreased relative abundances of short-chain  acid () producing genera during pregnancy. These diet-induced shifts paralleled decreased maternal intestinal mRNA levels of  receptor Gpr41, modestly decreased cecal butyrate, and altered mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines and immune cell markers in the maternal intestine. Maternal HFD resulted in impaired gut barrier integrity, with corresponding increases in circulating maternal levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumour necrosis factor. Placentas from HFD dams demonstrated blood vessel immaturity and hypoxia; decreased free carnitine, acylcarnitine derivatives and trimethylamine-N-oxide; and altered mRNA levels of inflammation, autophagy, and ER stress markers. HFD exposed fetuses had increased activation of nuclear factor-kappa B and inhibition of the unfolded protein response in the developing intestine. Taken together, these data suggest that HFD intake prior to and during pregnancy shifts the composition of the maternal gut microbiota and impairs gut barrier integrity, resulting in increased maternal circulating LPS, which may ultimate contribute to changes in placental vascularization and fetal gut development.© 2019 The Authors.

In this work, the profiles of  compounds (4  , 6 higher alcohols and 12 esters) from 34 European ciders were studied using HS-SPME-GC-MS. Volatiles were isolated by HS-SPME using a CAR/PDMS fiber. Analytical data were statistically evaluated using principal component analysis, and differences in composition of volatiles between cider produced using "intensified" technologies and that of ciders produced by traditional production processes were demonstrated. This difference was mainly due to varying contents of some higher alcohols (2-methylpropanol, isoamyl alcohols, hexanol, and butane-2,3-diol) and esters (ethyl 2-methylbutanoate, butylacetate, and hexyl acetate).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31289927>Duodenal Chemosensing of Short-Chain  : Implications for GI Diseases.</a></h1><p>Short-chain   (SCFAs), the main bacterial fermentation products in the hindgut of hindgut fermenters, are also present in the foregut lumen. We discuss the impact of SCFAs in the duodenal defense mechanisms and in the gastrointestinal (GI) pathogenesis.Luminal SCFAs augment the duodenal mucosal defenses via release of serotonin (-HT) and glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) from enteroendocrine cells. Released GLP-2 protects the small intestinal mucosa from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced enteropathy. SCFAs are also rapidly absorbed via  transporters and interact with afferent and myenteric nerves. Excessive  signals with -HT receptor overactivation may be implicated in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms.  production exhibits diurnal rhythms with host physiological responses, suggesting that oral  treatment may adjust the GI clocks. SCFAs are not only a source of energy but also signaling molecules for the local regulation of the GI tract and systemic regulation via release of gut hormones. Targeting  signals may be a novel therapeutic for GI diseases and metabolic syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306225>Intestinal microbiota composition in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: establishment of bacterial and archaeal communities analyses.</a></h1><p>Emerging evidences have indicated that the composition of gut microbiota was significantly influenced by central nervous system diseases. The digestion and metabolism disturbances of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) might be strongly associated with ALS; however, this has rarely been evaluated in these populations. This study was to evaluate bacterial and archaeal composition of gut flora and the corresponding metabolism performance of these micro-organisms in fecal samples of patients with ALS.A comparative study was performed on the intestinal microbiota from eight patients with ALS and eight healthy individuals at Huadong Hospital during November 2017 to April 2018; meanwhile, the metabolite concentrations of human endotoxin, short-chain   (), NO2-N/NO3-N, and γ-aminobutyric acid were also evaluated by spectrophotometry methods. The correlations between intestinal microbiota and metabolite concentration were compared between the two groups using one-way analysis of variance; the relative abundance of beneficial and harmful micro-organisms in fecal samples was also analyzed.In general, the richness and evenness of bacterial and archaeal communities of healthy individuals were healthier than that of patients with ALS. The phylum Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, genus Methanobrevibacter showed an enhancive tendency in patients with ALS, whereas the relative abundance of beneficial micro-organisms (genera Faecalibacterium and Bacteroides) presented a significant decrease tendency in patients with ALS. In addition, the average concentrations of human endotoxin, , NO2-N/NO3-N, and γ-aminobutyric acid in patients with ALS and healthy individuals were 64.2 vs. 65.3 EU/mL, 57. vs. 55.3 μg/mL, .7 vs. .3 ng/mL, and 6.1 vs. .4 μmol/L, respectively, indicating that the digestion and metabolism functions of gastrointestinal tract of patients might decline with this disease.The relative abundance of beneficial and harmful micro-organisms respectively showed decrease and increase tendency in patients with ALS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604174>Cow manure as additive to a DMBR for stable and high-rate digestion of food waste: Performance and microbial community.</a></h1><p>Cow manure (CM) was added to a dynamic membrane bioreactor (DMBR) operated under anaerobic condition for enhancing food waste (FW) digestion for over 300 days with stepwise increase of organic loading rates (OLRs) from 1.07 to 11.9 g COD/L/day. At a FW/CM ratio of 3.:1 (based on  solids), the mixed liquor pH was always above 8.0 and no apparent  (VFAs) accumulation occurred even at the highest OLR of 11.9 g COD/L/day (hydraulic retention time as 10 days and solid retention time as 15. days, correspondingly), indicating a very stable operation condition which resulted in an average CH yield as high as 250 mL/g COD and CH production as high as 2.71 L CH/L/day. The hardly biodegradable organic components, such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, were effectively degraded by 78.3%, 58.8%, and 47.%, respectively. Significantly high anaerobic digestion reaction ratios, especially the hydrolysis ratio which is usually the limiting factor, were calculated based on experimental results. Furthermore, the high lignocellulase contents and coenzyme F levels, along with the decrease of cellulose crystallinity from 72.6% to 16.4% in the feedstock, provided strong evidence of an enhanced biological activity by CM addition. By high-throughput sequencing analysis, more abundant and diverse bacterial, archaeal, and fungal genera were identified from the DMBR sludge. With CM addition, the biodegradation of lignocellulose might have produced sufficient H and CO for the hydrogenotrophic methanogens such as Methanoculleus, Methanomassiliicoccus, and Methanobacterium, which were highly tolerant to ammonium inhibition, and then the elevated ammonium level would have provided high buffering capacity in the DMBR thus ensuring a stable condition for high rate FW digestion and CH production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study included 2 experiments. In experiment (Exp.) 1, sixteen 35-day-old meat ducks were used to evaluate the AME of RPS by orogastric administration. Results showed the AME value of RPS on ducks is 2.76 kcal/g. In Exp. 2, a total of 600 one-day-old ducklings were randomly assigned to  isonitrogenous and isoenergetic dietary treatments that included 0 (control), 6, 12, 18, and 24% RPS, respectively. Samples were collected at both of 14 and 35 D. Neither growth performance nor ileal parameters (length, weight, and pH) at both of 14 and 35 D was affected by dietary RPS. However, the mucosal thickness (14 D), villus height (except for 18% RPS at 14 D), and the villus height: crypt depth ratio (14 and 35 D) of the ileum were increased in the 12 and 18% RPS diets when compared to 0% RPS diet. Meanwhile, proinflammatory factors such as plasma interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 (14 D) reduced in 12% RPS diet and tumor necrosis factor α decreased in 12% (except for 14 D) and 18% RPS groups. When compared with the control group, diets with 18% RPS significantly increased mucin 2 gene expression at 14 D, and 12% RPS elevated the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins including Zonula occludens-1 and Claudin 1 (except for 14 D) in the ileal mucosa of birds. Furthermore, ducks fed 12% RPS diet had higher concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate in cecal digesta than other groups. These findings indicated that diets with 12 and/or 18% RPS increased the cecal  concentration, which subsequently enhanced the barrier function and improved intestinal health in the ileum for 14 and 35-day-old meat ducks.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31386790>Nutritive value of treated Quercus infectoria and Quercus libani leaves with the tannin-degrading bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae for ruminant feeding in vitro.</a></h1><p>This study was conducted to evaluate the chemical composition and in vitro gas production (GP) and fermentation parameters of Quercus infectoria and Quercus libani leaves following treatment with the Klebsiella pneumoniae, a tannin-degrading bacterium.This isolate was isolated on medium containing tannic acid as the sole source of carbon and energy, and identified based on 16S rRNA sequencing analysis.

In both oak leaves the measuring parameters including GP volume, in vitro digestibility of DM and OM, estimated metabolizable energy, total , acetate, ammonia nitrogen concentration, total protozoal population and the subfamily Isotricha in treatments were higher (P < 0·05) than control.It can be concluded that biological treatment of Q. infectoria and Q. libani leaves with K. pneumoniae represents a useful approach to decrease their phenolic compound content and improve their nutritive value as ruminant feed.This study demonstrated that biologically processing of tannin-containing by-products with K. pneumoniae could increase their nutritive value as ruminant feeds and increase animal productivity.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31212318>Genetic parameters of plasma and ruminal  in sheep fed alfalfa pellets and genetic correlations with enteric methane emissions1.</a></h1><p>Animal-to-animal variation in methane (CH4) emissions determined in respiration chambers has a genetic basis, but rapid phenotyping methods that can be applied on-farm are required to enable increased genetic progress by the farming industry. Fermentation of carbohydrates in the rumen results in the formation of VFA with hydrogen (H2) as a byproduct that is used for CH4 formation. Generally, fermentation pathways leading to acetate are associated with the most H2 production, less H2 formation is associated with butyrate production, and propionate and valerate production are associated with reduced H2 production. Therefore, VFA may constitute a potential correlated proxy for CH4 emissions to enable high-throughput animal screening. The objective of the present study was to determine the genetic parameters for ruminal and plasma VFA concentrations in sheep fed alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) pellets and their genetic (rg) and phenotypic (rp) correlations with CH4 emissions. Measurements of CH4 emissions in respiration chambers and ruminal (stomach tubing 18 h from last meal) and blood plasma (3 h post-feeding) VFA concentrations were made on 1,538 lambs from  birth years (2007 and 2009 to 2012) aged between  and 10 mo, while the animals were fed alfalfa pellets at 2.0 times maintenance requirements in 2 equal size meals (0900 and 1500 h). These measurements were repeated twice (rounds) 14 d apart. Mean (± SD) CH4 production was 24.4 ± 3.08 g/d, and the mean CH4 yield was 15.8 ± 1.51 g/kg DMI. Mean concentration of total ruminal VFA was 52.2 mM, with concentrations of acetate, propionate and butyrate of 35.97, 8.83, and 4.02 mM, respectively. Ruminal total VFA concentration had heritability (h2) and repeatability estimates (± SE) of 0.24 ± 0.05 and 0.35 ± 0.03, respectively, and similar estimates were found for acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Blood plasma concentrations of VFA had much lower estimates of h2 and repeatability than ruminal VFA. Genetic correlations with CH4 yield were greatest for total concentrations of ruminal VFA and acetate, with 0.54 ± 0.12 and 0.56 ± 0.12, respectively, which were much greater than their corresponding rp. The rp and rg of ruminal VFA proportions and blood VFAs with CH4 emissions were in general lower than for ruminal VFA concentrations. However, minor ruminal VFA proportions had also moderate rg with CH4 yield. Pre-feeding concentrations of total VFA and acetate were the strongest correlated proxies to select sheep that are genetically low CH4 emitters.© The Author(s) 2019.

Due to saturable uptake, high dose oral B supplements are largely unabsorbed and reach the distal gut where they are available to interact with the microbiota. The aim of this study was to determine if oral B supplementation in mice alters 1) the concentration of B and related corrinoids in the distal gut, 2) the fecal microbiome, 3) short chain   (), and 4) susceptibility to experimental colitis. C57BL/6 mice (up to 24 animals/group) were supplemented with oral 3.94 µg/ml cyanocobalamin (B), a dose selected to approximate a single  mg supplement for a human. Active vitamin B (cobalamin), and four B-analogues ([ADE]CN-Cba, [2Me-ADE]CN-Cba, [2MeS-ADE]CN-Cba, CN-Cbi) were analyzed in cecal and fecal contents using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), in parallel with evaluation of fecal microbiota, cecal , and susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis. At baseline, active B was a minor constituent of overall cecal (0.86%) and fecal (0.44%) corrinoid. Oral B supplementation increased active B at distal sites by >130-fold (cecal B increased from 0.08 to 10.60 ng/mg, fecal B increased from 0.06 to 7.81 ng/ml) and reduced microbe-derived fecal corrinoid analogues ([ADE]CN-Cba, [2Me-ADE]CN-Cba, [2MeS-ADE]CN-Cba). Oral B had no effect on cecal . Microbial diversity was unaffected by this intervention, however a selective decrease in Bacteroides was observed with B treatment.

Male Holstein calves (n = 158) transported from auction barns and local dairy farms were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 decoquinate-containing CMR for the first 49 d of the experiment: all milk protein and no additives (CONT); 15% of crude protein (CP) replaced with spray-dried porcine plasma, no additives (PLM); or all milk protein and an added combination of sodium butyrate (rate 1.4 kg of butyric acid/Mt) and Bacillus subtilis (1.28 million cfu/g of feed; BB). All milk replacers were formulated to contain 26% CP and 17% fat, 2.4% Lys, and 0.8% Met, and were bucket-fed at daily feeding rates of 520 g during wk 1 and 2, 650 g during wk 3, and 900 g during wk 4 and , in a total of 4, , and 6 L of solution, respectively. Calves were offered texturized calf starter (18% CP) upon arrival until wk 3 and transitioned to a corn and pellet ration with 2% straw (18.1% CP). No prophylactic administration of antibiotics occurred. All calves were gradually weaned over a 2-wk period. Calves were individually housed until weaned and then housed in groups of  in a mechanically ventilated facility in southwestern Ontario, Canada. Fecal scores, treatments administered (antibiotic or supportive therapy), and mortalities were recorded daily. Body weight was measured using a digital scale at arrival and at 14, 49, 56, and 78 d after arrival. No differences were found among the groups with respect to growth, feed efficiency, or incidence of diarrhea or respiratory infection treatment. Calves supplemented with BB had a greater hazard of mortality over the growing period compared with CONT. An interaction was found between the BB group and the level of total serum protein, with the BB group having a lower proportion of days with a fecal score of 3 when the calves had a higher total serum protein level. Calves fed PLM had a lower proportion of d with a fecal score of 3 relative to CONT but no difference in the proportion of d with a fecal score of 2 or higher. This study found that the addition of spray-dried plasma in CMR reduced diarrhea severity; however, supplementing BB was associated with a higher hazard of calf mortality and had a varying response on fecal score.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

II: Impact on   acid absorption.</a></h1><p>Diet is known to affect rumen growth and development. Calves fed an all-liquid diet have smaller and less developed rumens and a decreased ability to absorb  (VFA) compared to calves fed both liquid and dry feed. However, it is unknown how rumens respond when challenged with a defined concentration of VFA. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of 2 different feeding programs on VFA absorption in preweaned calves. Neonatal Holstein bull calves were individually housed and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 diets. The diets were milk replacer only (MRO; n = ) or milk replacer with starter (MRS; n = 6). Diets were isoenergetic (3.87 ± 0.06 Mcal of metabolizable energy per day) and isonitrogenous (0.17 ± 0.003 kg/d of apparent digestible protein). Milk replacer was 22% crude protein, 21.% fat (dry matter basis). The textured calf starter was 21.% crude protein (dry matter basis). Feed and ad libitum water intakes were recorded daily. Calves were exposed to a defined concentration of VFA buffer (acetate 143 mM, propionate 100 mM, butyrate 40. mM) 6 h before euthanasia on d 43 ± 1. Rumen fluid samples were obtained every 15 to 30 min for 6 h to measure the rate of VFA absorption. Rumen tissues were obtained from the ventral sac region and processed for morphological and immunohistochemical analyses of the VFA transporters monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) and 4 (MCT4). Body growth did not differ between diets, but empty reticulorumens were heavier in MRS than MRO calves (0.67 vs. 0.39 ± 0.04 kg) and MRS calves had larger papillae areas (0.76 vs. 15 ± 0.08 mm). We observed no differences between diets in terms of the abundance of MCT1 and MCT4 per unit area. These results indicate that the extrapolated increase in total abundance of MCT1 or MCT4 in MRS calves was not due to increased transporter density per unit area. Modeled VFA absorption metrics (flux, mmol/h, or 6 h absorbed VFA in mmol) were not different across diets. These results demonstrate that the form of calfhood diet, whether solely MR or MR and starter, does not alter VFA absorption capacity when the rumen is exposed to a defined concentration of VFA at 6 wk of age.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The objectives of this experiment were to investigate effects of different preweaning diets on the growth and development of the rumen epithelium and on putative rumen epithelial stem and progenitor cell measurements at the gene and cell levels. Neonatal Holstein bull calves (n = 11) were individually housed and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 diets. The diets were milk replacer only (MRO; n = ) or milk replacer with starter (MRS; n = 6).

Milk replacer was 22% crude protein, 21.% fat (dry matter basis). The textured calf starter was 21.% crude protein (dry matter basis). Water was available ad libitum and feed and water intake were recorded daily. Putative stem and progenitor cells were labeled by administering a thymidine analog (-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, BrdU;  mg/kg of body weight in sterile saline) for  consecutive days and allowed a 25-d washout period.

We obtained rumen tissue from the ventral sac and used it for immunohistochemical analyses of BrdU (putative stem and progenitor cells) and Ki67 (cell proliferation), gene expression analysis, and morphological measurements via hematoxylin and eosin staining. Epithelial stem and progenitor cell gene markers of interest, analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR, were β1-integrin, keratin-14, notch-1, tumor protein p63, and leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor . Body growth did not differ by diet, but empty reticulorumens were heavier in MRS calves (MRS: 0.67 ± 0.04 kg; MRO: 0.39 ± 0.04 kg). The percentage of label-retaining BrdU basale cells was higher in MRO calves than in MRS calves (2.0 ± 0.3% vs. 0.3 ± 0.2%, respectively). We observed a higher percentage of basale cells undergoing proliferation in MRS calves than in MRO calves (18.4 ± 2.6% vs. 10.8 ± 2.8%, respectively). Rumen epithelial gene expression was not affected by diet, but the submucosa was thicker in MRO calves and the epithelium and corneum/keratin layers were thicker in MRS calves. Presumptive stem and progenitor cells in the rumen epithelium were identifiable by their ability to retain labeled DNA in the long term, changed proliferative status in response to diet, and likely contributed to observed treatment differences in rumen tissue thickness.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Anaerobic processes are suitable for the treatment of wastewater high in organics to achieve pollution control and recovery of energy as methane and hydrogen, or intermediates for production of biofuels and valuable biochemicals. A distinction between protein hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation, especially for dissolved proteins, is needed to target which one is truly rate-limiting and to effectively harvest bioproducts during anaerobic conversion of these wastewaters. This study explored mesophilic anaerobic hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation of gelatine, as a model for dissolved proteins, at pH 7 and at pH .The results showed that at pH 7, protein hydrolysis (first-order rate of 0.15 h) was approximately  times faster than acidification of the hydrolysis products (first-order rate of 0.03 h), implying that not hydrolysis but acidification was the rate-limiting step in anaerobic dissolved protein degradation. This was confirmed by (temporary) accumulation of amino . Nineteen different amino  were detected during the first 8 incubation hours of gelatine at neutral pH and the total chemical oxygen demand (COD) of these 19 amino  was up to approximately 40% of the COD of the gelatine that was added. Protein hydrolysis at pH  was 2-25 times slower than at pH 7. Shifting the initial pH from neutral to acidic conditions (pH ) inhibited protein degradation and changed the  (VFA) product profile. Furthermore, the presence or absence of methanogenic activity did not affect the rates of protein hydrolysis and acidification.The findings in this study can help to set a suitable solid retention time to accomplish anaerobic degradation of protein-rich wastewaters in continuous reactor systems. For example, if the target is harvesting VFAs, methanogens can be washed-out for a shorter retention time while amino acid fermentation, instead of hydrolysis as assumed previously, will govern the design and solutions to improve the system dealing with dissolved proteins.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195972>Changes in the gut microbiome and fermentation products concurrent with enhanced longevity in acarbose-treated mice.</a></h1><p>Treatment with the α-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose increases median lifespan by approximately 20% in male mice and % in females. This longevity extension differs from dietary restriction based on a number of features, including the relatively small effects on weight and the sex-specificity of the lifespan effect. By inhibiting host digestion, acarbose increases the flux of starch to the lower digestive system, resulting in changes to the gut microbiota and their fermentation products. Given the documented health benefits of short-chain   (SCFAs), the dominant products of starch fermentation by gut bacteria, this secondary effect of acarbose could contribute to increased longevity in mice. To explore this hypothesis, we compared the fecal microbiome of mice treated with acarbose to control mice at three independent study sites.Microbial communities and the concentrations of SCFAs in the feces of mice treated with acarbose were notably different from those of control mice. At all three study sites, the bloom of a single bacterial taxon was the most obvious response to acarbose treatment. The blooming populations were classified to the largely uncultured Bacteroidales family Muribaculaceae and were the same taxonomic unit at two of the three sites. Propionate concentrations in feces were consistently elevated in treated mice, while the concentrations of acetate and butyrate reflected a dependence on study site. Across all samples, Muribaculaceae abundance was strongly correlated with propionate and community composition was an important predictor of  concentrations. Cox proportional hazards regression showed that the fecal concentrations of acetate, butyrate, and propionate were, together, predictive of mouse longevity even while controlling for sex, site, and acarbose.We observed a correlation between fecal SCFAs and lifespan in mice, suggesting a role of the gut microbiota in the longevity-enhancing properties of acarbose. Treatment modulated the taxonomic composition and fermentation products of the gut microbiome, while the site-dependence of the responses illustrate the challenges facing reproducibility and interpretation in microbiome studies. These results motivate future studies exploring manipulation of the gut microbial community and its fermentation products for increased longevity, testing causal roles of SCFAs in the observed effects of acarbose.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618992>Effect of Native and Acetylated Dietary Resistant Starches on Intestinal Fermentative Capacity of Normal and Stunted Children in Southern India.</a></h1><p>The health benefits of dietary amylase resistant starch (RS) arise from intestinal microbial fermentation and generation of short chain   (). We compared the intestinal fermentative capability of stunted and nonstunted ('healthy') children in southern India using two types of RS: high amylose maize starch (HAMS) and acetylated HAMS (HAMSA). Twenty children (10 stunted and 10 healthy) aged 2 to  years were fed biscuits containing HAMS (10 g/day) for two weeks followed by a 2-week washout and then HAMSA biscuits (10 g/day) for 2 weeks. Fecal samples were collected at 3-4 day intervals and pH and  analyzed. At entry, stunted children had lower  concentrations compared to healthy children. Both types of RS led to a significant decrease in fecal pH and increase in fecal acetate and propionate in both healthy and stunted children. However, while HAMS increased fecal butyrate in both groups of children, HAMSA increased butyrate in healthy but not stunted children. Furthermore, healthy children showed a significantly greater increase than stunted children in both acetate and butyrate when fed either RS. No adverse effects were reported with either RS. Stunted children have impaired capacity to ferment certain types of RS which has implications for choice of RS in formulations aimed at improving microbial function in stunted children.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31030921>Effects of Saccharomyces cerevisiae-based direct-fed microbial and exogenous enzyme products on enteric methane emission and productivity in lactating dairy cows.</a></h1><p>The objective of this experiment was to investigate the effects of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae-based direct-fed microbial product (SDM) and an exogenous enzyme product (ENZ) on enteric methane emission, milk yield and composition, total-tract digestibility of nutrients, ruminal fermentation, and nitrogen excretion and secretion in lactating dairy cows. Eighteen Holstein cows were used in a 3 × 3 Latin square design experiment with three 28-d periods. Treatments were (1) control (no additive), (2) 28 g of SDM/d per cow, or (3) 10 g of ENZ/d per cow. Treatments were top-dressed at the time of feeding. The basal diet consisted of (dry matter basis) 60% forage and 40% concentrates and contained 16.% crude protein and 32.0% neutral detergent fiber. Treatments had no effect on enteric methane production, yield (methane per kg of dry matter intake, DMI), or intensity (methane per kg of energy-corrected milk yield). Carbon dioxide production was similar among treatments. Compared with control, SDM increased milk yield by 2 kg/d without affecting DMI or feed efficiency. Supplementation of the diet with ENZ did not affect DMI, milk yield, or feed efficiency. Concentrations and yields of milk fat, true protein, and lactose, and energy-corrected milk yield were not different among treatments. Neither SDM nor ENZ had an effect on total-tract digestibility of nutrients or nitrogen excretion and secretion. Concentration of total  (VFA) in ruminal fluid was increased by both SDM and ENZ, and rumen pH was decreased by SDM compared with the control. At levels similar to the control DMI, the increased concentration of VFA in ruminal fluid of cows receiving SDM suggests an increased postruminal supply of energy and may partly explain the increased milk yield with that treatment. However, it is important to note that milk composition and energy-corrected milk yield were not affected by treatment.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The results indicated that a high stirring velocity gradient could cause sludge disintegration, which could not only shorten the fermentation time, but also increase the production of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) and  (VFAs) by 8.3% and 9.%, respectively. Moreover, mechanical elutriation could also promote the release of SCOD from sludge to water, resulting in an increase in the yield of SCOD by 9.2%, it was observed that elutriation intensity plays a more important role than the elutriation time.

The relative abundance of fermentative bacteria in the reactor with a stirring intensity (G) of 160 s was 13.8%, which was significantly higher than that in the reactor with G = 31 s (8.037%), so the accumulation of VFAs and SCOD in the reactor with G = 160 s was improved.Copyright © 2019.

Four experimental diets were formulated to include % of either fresh canola oil (0 mEq/kg of peroxide value) or oxidized canola oil (180 mEq/kg of peroxide value). An equal portion of each diet was supplemented with 0.1% TA. Eight pigs (initial body weight of 82.89 ± 2.26 kg) were surgically fitted with a T-cannula at the distal ileum. At the beginning of the experiments, all pigs were fed a nitrogen-free diet for 7 d. Then, they were assigned to 4 dietary treatments according to an incomplete replicated 4 × 3 Latin square design with 3 periods to give 6 replicates per treatment. Each experimental period lasted for 9 d, starting with a -d adaptation period followed by 2 consecutive 2-d periods for fecal (day 6 and day 7) and ileal digesta (day 8 and day 9) collection. The inclusion of oxidized oil reduced (P < 0.05) the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of Pro and the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of NDF. Also, pigs fed the oxidized oil tended to have lower (P ≤ 0.10) lactate and ammonia-nitrogen concentrations in the ileum and lower (P ≤ 0.10) acetate and propionate concentrations in the feces than those fed the fresh oil. The supplementation of 0.1% TA reduced (P < 0.05) the AID of NDF and the ATTD of gross energy, crude protein, and NDF. Additionally, the TA-supplemented diet tended to have a lower (P ≤ 0.10) digestible energy content than the nonsupplemented diet. Pigs fed the TA-supplemented diet showed reduced (P < 0.05) AID and SID of His, Cys, and Pro compared with those fed the nonsupplemented diet. There were interactive effects (P < 0.05) of oxidized oil and TA supplementation on acetate, isovalerate, total short chain  , and pH level in the ileum. In conclusion, the results indicated that the effects of oxidized oil are greater on microbial activities rather than nutrient digestibility. Although negative effects of dietary TA supplementation were observed in relation to nutrient digestibility, TA supplementation was found to ameliorate these negative effects of oxidized oil on microbial metabolites. Therefore, further studies are required to investigate the interaction between dietary oxidized oil and TA in relation with the gut microbiota in pigs.© The Author(s) 2019.

The CS was pretreated by water freezing-thawing (water-FT) and ammonia freezing-thawing (ammonia-FT), and then pretreated and untreated CS were anaerobically digested in three continuously stirred tank biodigesters (CSTBRs) at three organic loading rate (OLR) of 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0 gVS L d. The analyses showed that pH value and  (VFAs) concentration of three systems were in reasonable ranges of 6.8-7. and 160-330 mg L, respectively. Total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) in R3 system ranged from 600 mg L to 1300 mg L, which was conducive to maintain system stability. The removal amount of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) of CS by ammonia-FT pretreatment was 17.3-20.% higher than that of water-FT pretreatment. The results also showed that CS pretreated by ammonia-FT achieved 27.8-32.4% and 13.9-16.1% more methane yield (250-267 mL g) than those of untreated and water-FT pretreatment, respectively. Correspondingly, ammonia-FT pretreated CS in R3 obtained the highest conversion rates of 47.7%, 56.9%, 42.7%, and 48.8% for TS, VS, cellulose, and hemicellulose, respectively, and the lowest cost was of 0.0336 USD m CH and the highest energy recovery of 2428.1 kWh kg.

Renewable sources of energy are becoming an increasingly important substitute for fossil fuels. An important step in this direction is the isolation of novel, technologically relevant microorganisms.  sp. strain OM-1 can convert  short-chain   in wastewater into 2-butenoic acid and its ester and can accumulate intracellularly esterified compounds up to 50% of its dried cell weight under nitrogen-depleted conditions. It is believed that a novel  acid biosynthesis pathway including an esterifying enzyme is encoded in its genome. In this study, we report the whole-genome sequence (4.8 Mb) of OM-1, which comprises a chromosome (3,977,827 bp) and a megaplasmid (857,937 bp). This sequence information provides insight into the genome organization and biochemical pathways of OM-1. In addition, we identified lipid biosynthesis pathways in OM-1, paving the way to a better understanding of its biochemical characterization.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31255268>Effects of ad libitum milk replacer feeding and butyrate supplementation on the epithelial growth and development of the gastrointestinal tract in Holstein calves.</a></h1><p>Intensive milk feeding and butyrate supplementation in calves stimulate body growth and affect gastrointestinal development. The aim of the present study was to investigate the synergistic effects of ad libitum milk replacer (MR) feeding and butyrate supplementation of MR on rumen and small intestinal growth and on gene expression in the small intestine related to growth and energy metabolism at weaning. Male Holstein calves (n = 32) received colostrum from birth to d 3 of age and MR either ad libitum (Adl) or restrictively (Res; 6 L of MR/d; 12.% solids) with (AdlB+, ResB+) or without (AdlB-, ResB-) 0.24% butyrate from d 4 until wk 8 of age. From wk 9 to 10, all calves were weaned and were fed 2 L/d until the end of the trial. Concentrate, hay, and water were freely available. At d 80, calves were slaughtered,  were measured in rumen fluid, and rumen and small intestine samples were taken for histomorphometric measurements. The expression of mRNA associated with the local insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system and glucose metabolism as well as lactase and maltase activities were measured in the intestinal mucosa. The small intestine was 3 m longer in Adl than in Res. In the atrium ruminis, papilla width was greater in Res than in Adl. Villus circumference, cut surface, and height in the duodenum, proximal jejunum, and ileum were greater in Adl than in Res and in the proximal, mid, and distal jejunum and ileum were greater in calves treated with butyrate. Crypt depth in the duodenum and proximal jejunum was greater in Adl than in Res and in the ileum was smaller in calves treated with butyrate. The villus height:crypt depth ratio was greatest in AdlB+ calves. In the proximal and mid jejunum, IGF1 mRNA abundance was lower in calves treated with butyrate. In the proximal jejunum, INSR mRNA abundance was greater in Res than in Adl. The abundance of PCK2 mRNA was greater in Res than in Adl in the duodenum and was greatest in ResB- in the mid jejunum. Lactase activity tended to be greater in Res than in Adl and after butyrate treatment in the proximal jejunum. The results indicated an elevated growth of the small intestinal mucosa at weaning due to intensive milk feeding and butyrate supplementation, and the local IGF system was involved in intestinal growth regulation. Rumen development was not affected by butyrate supplementation of MR and was slightly delayed due to ad libitum MR feeding.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

A total of 30 weaning pigs were assigned to  diets, without additive (CON), with antibiotics (ATB), with 1% organic acid (OA; 64% formic and 25% propionic acid), with OA plus 0.2% capric acid (OA + CRA), and with OA plus 0.02% probiotic (; OA + PB). After oral challenge with ETEC on day 10, the feces and plasma of all pigs were collected at different time points. Four additive treatments all decreased rectal temperature (RT) at 9 h and fecal scores (FS) at 24 h after challenge ( < 0.05), while at 9 h after challenge, inclusion of OA induced a decrease of RT compared with OA + CRA and OA + PB ( < 0.05). In plasma, concentration of interleukin (IL)-1 was reduced with the addition of ATB and OA at 24 h and 48 h after challenge and it is lower in OA group than OA + CRA group at 24 h after challenge ( < 0.05). Diets with ATB, OA, and OA + PB caused a decrease of the concentrations of IL-6 in plasma at 9 h after challenge ( < 0.05).

We hypothesized that ENZ supplemented in an LP diet would improve growth performance and physiological response in broilers for 8-35 days. To investigate this, we used a 2 × 2 factorial design with crude protein (CP, normal diet (NP) and LP) and ENZ. The LP diet contained low in 1% CP and ca. 8-12% amino  compared to the NP diet and both NP and LP diets were added without or with (1 g/kg of diet) ENZ. We randomly allocated 720 1-week-old Ross 308 male chicks to 48 pens and experimental diets. At 21 days, dietary ENZ, but not CP, increased ( = 0.007) live body weight. Body weight gain from 8-21 days was affected ( = 0.006) by dietary ENZ, but was not affected ( = 0.210) by CP. The feed conversion ratio was affected by both CP and ENZ during the starter period ( < 0.05), by ENZ ( = 0.034) during the finisher period, and by CP ( < 0.001) during the whole period. However, the interaction between CP and ENZ did not significantly affect growth performance ( > 0.05). Dietary ENZ increased ( = 0.013) the relative weight of liver at 21 days. CP and ENZ affected ( = 0.043) total short-chain   at 21 days. However, this effect was not seen ( = 0.888) at 35 days. Dietary CP increased ( < 0.05) the serum concentrations of both uric acid and creatinine in broilers. We concluded that dietary ENZ is more beneficial to younger broilers, independent of CP levels, and that its effect was restricted to body weight and the feed conversion ratio.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31025252>Silibinin inhibits in vitro ketosis by regulating HMGCS2 and NF-kB: elucidation of signaling molecule relationship under ketotic conditions.</a></h1><p>Ketosis is a condition where ketone bodies are produced as an alternative energy source, due to insufficient glucose for energy production so that the body switches from carbohydrate metabolism to mostly fat metabolism. In this study, we examined the anti-ketosis effects of silibinin, a major active component of silymarin. We induced ketosis in FL83B mouse hepatocytes in vitro by culturing in low glucose media and compared results to hepatocytes maintained in high-glucose conditions. We quantified β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels with a colorimetric assay. In low-glucose conditions, silibinin reduced the amount of BHB produced, compared to high-glucose conditions; thus, silibinin exhibited an anti-ketotic effect. Ketone body formation during beta oxidation is mediated by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2). The nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) regulates the transcription of HMGCS2, and plays a vital role in BHB levels. We showed that silibinin inhibited the expression of HMGCS2 and NF-kB at transcriptional and translational levels. Silibinin also inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-kB and its DNA binding activity. To elucidate the relationship between HMGCS2 and NF-kB, we tested inhibited and over-expressed NF-kB. We found that NF-kB acted as a positive regulator for HMGCS2 under ketosis treatment conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30992568>Chemogenetics defines receptor-mediated functions of short chain free  .</a></h1><p>Differentiating actions of short chain   (SCFAs) at free  acid receptor 2 (FFA2) from other free  acid-responsive receptors and from non-receptor-mediated effects has been challenging. Using a novel chemogenetic and knock-in strategy, whereby an engineered variant of FFA2 (FFA2-DREADD) that is unresponsive to natural SCFAs but is instead activated by sorbic acid replaced the wild-type receptor, we determined that activation of FFA2 in differentiated adipocytes and colonic crypt enteroendocrine cells of mouse accounts fully for -regulated lipolysis and release of the incretin glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), respectively. In vivo studies confirmed the specific role of FFA2 in GLP-1 release and also demonstrated a direct role for FFA2 in accelerating gut transit. Thereby, we establish the general principle that such a chemogenetic knock-in strategy can successfully define novel G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) biology and provide both target validation and establish therapeutic potential of a 'hard to target' GPCR.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31385316>Effects of silencing TT8 and HB12 on in vitro nutrients degradation and VFA production in relation to molecular structures of alfalfa (Medicago sativa).</a></h1><p>Transparent Testa8 (TT8) and Homeobox12 (HB12) are two transcriptional factors in plant phenylpropanoid pathways and were reported to be positively related to lignin content. Alfalfa with silenced TT8 (TT8i) and HB12 (HB12i) was therefore generated using the RNA interference (RNAi) technique. Although lignin was found to be high in HB12i, such gene-silencing of alfalfa resulted in nutrient profiles that might be suitable for grazing. To extend the nutritional evaluation of transformed alfalfa, ground samples of 11 HB12i,  TT8i and 4 wild type (WT) were incubated in rumen fluid : buffer solution for 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h at 39 °C. Dry matter (DM) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) degradations at each time point, and production of  (VFA) at 4, 12, 24 and 48 h were analyzed, as well as degradation and production kinetics. The correlations and regressions between nutritive profiles and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectral parameters were determined.Both transformed genotypes had lower DM degradation and HB12i had lower VFA production compared with WT. Structural carbohydrate (STC) parameters were found to be negatively correlated with DM degradation and VFA production. The kinetics of DM degradation and VFA production were predicted from spectral parameters with good estimation power.Silencing of HB12 and TT8 affected fermentation characteristics of alfalfa and some fermentation characteristics were predictable from spectral parameters using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169448>Reactor performance and economic evaluation of singular, binary, and ternary mixing of feedstocks for anaerobic digestion.</a></h1><p>This study compared the performance of singular, binary, and ternary mixing of feedstocks for anaerobic digestion.

Hence, this study was conducted to determine the effects of Enterococcus faecium SROD on in vitro rumen fermentation, methane concentration, and microbial population structure. Ruminal samples were collected from ruminally cannulated Holstein-Friesian cattle, and 40:60 rice straw to concentrate ratio was used as substrate. Fresh culture of E. faecium SROD at different inclusion rates (0, 0.1%, 0.%, and 1.0%) were investigated using in vitro rumen fermentation system. Addition of E. faecium SROD had a significant effect on total gas production with the greatest effect observed with 0.1% supplementation; however, there was no significant influence on pH. Supplementation of 0.1% E. faecium SROD resulted in the highest propionate (P = 0.005) but the lowest methane concentration (P = 0.001). In addition, acetate, butyrate, and total VFA concentrations in treatments were comparatively higher than control. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the predominance of the bacterial phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and the archaeal phylum Euryarchaeota. At the genus level, Prevotella (15-17%) and Methanobrevibacter (96%) dominated the bacterial and archaeal communities of the in vitro rumen fermenta, respectively. Supplementation of 0.1% E. faecium SROD resulted in the highest quantities of total bacteria and Ruminococcus flavefaciens, whereas 1.0% E. faecium SROD resulted in the highest contents of total fungi and Fibrobacter succinogenes.

To characterize the potential roles of JAZ gene family in plant development and abiotic stress response, fifteen JAZs were identified based on the genome of Nicotiana tabacum. Structural analysis confirmed the presence of single Jas and TIFY motif. Tissue expression pattern analysis indicated that NtJAZ-2, -3, -, and -10 were highly expressed in roots and NtJAZ-11 was expressed only in the cotyledons. The transcript level of NtJAZ-3, -, -9, and -10 in the stem epidermis was higher than that in the stem without epidermis. Dynamic expression of NtJAZs exposed to abiotic stress and phytohormone indicated that the expression of most NtJAZs was activated by salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, gibberellic acid, cold, salt, and heat stresses. With abscisic acid treatment, NtJAZ-1, -2, and -3 were not activated; NtJAZ-4, -, and -6 were up-regulated; and the remaining NtJAZ genes were inhibited. With drought stress, the expression of NtJAZ-1, -2, -3, -4, -, -6, -7, and -8 was up-regulated, whereas the transcript of the remaining genes was inhibited. Moreover, high concentration MeJA (more than 1 mM MeJA) had an effect on secreting trichome induction, but inhabited the plant growth. Nine NtJAZs may play important role in secreting trichome induction. These results indicate that the JAZ proteins are convergence points for various phytohormone signal networks, which are involved in abiotic stress responses.Copyright © 2019.

Additionally, a change occurs in the innate immune response during this period, which contributes to increased risk of disease. In the current study, we compared the transcriptomes of neutrophils from dairy cows divergent in their metabolic health post-calving. Cows (n =  per risk group) were selected from a parent experiment (n = 45 cows). Those with high or low concentrations of plasma nonesterified  , plasma β-hydroxybutyrate, and liver triacylglycerol in both wk 1 and 2 were deemed to be at "high risk" (HR) or "low risk" (LR) of metabolic dysfunction, respectively. Circulating neutrophils were isolated at 3 time points during the transition period (d 0 and wk 1 and 4 post-calving), and gene expression was analyzed using RNA sequencing. Differential gene expression between the risk groups was determined using edgeR (http://bioconductor.org), and pathway analysis was conducted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Statistical analysis indicated no interaction between risk and week. Therefore, the overall effect of risk was analyzed across all time points. In total, 3,500 genes were differentially expressed between the HR and LR cows (false discovery rate < 0.05). Of these, 2,897 genes were identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and used for pathway analysis. Of the relevant pathways identified, neutrophils isolated from HR cows showed downregulation of genes involved in the recruitment of granulocytes, interferon signaling, and apoptosis, and upregulation of genes involved in cell survival. The results indicate that metabolically stressed cows had reduced neutrophil function during the peripartum period, highlighting a potential relationship between subclinical metabolic disease and innate immune function that suggests that metabolic health negatively affects the innate immune system and may contribute to the state of immunosuppression during the peripartum period. In this way, the metabolic stress among the HR cows may reduce their ability to combat infection during the transition period.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

PIF demonstrated prebiotic potential by enhancing the growth of the probiotics under study and thereby hindered colon cancer development. The soluble dietary fibre from Musa paradisiaca inflorescence (PIF) was fermented using Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium bifidum.

Histamine H3 receptor (H3R) and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) are involved in several cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, anxiety, and narcolepsy, all of which are comorbid with ASD. Therefore, the present study aimed at evaluating effect of the novel dual-active ligand E100 with high H3R antagonist affinity and balanced AChE inhibition on autistic-like repetitive behavior, anxiety parameters, locomotor activity, and neuroinflammation in a mouse model of VPA-induced ASD in C57BL/6 mice. E100 (, 10, and 15 mg/kg) dose-dependently and significantly ameliorated repetitive and compulsive behaviors by reducing the increased percentages of nestlets shredded (all P < 0.05). Moreover, pretreatment with E100 (10 and 15 mg/kg) attenuated disturbed anxiety levels (P < 0.05) but failed to restore the hyperactivity observed in the open field test. Furthermore, pretreatment with E100 (10 mg/kg) the increased microglial activation, proinflammatory cytokines and expression of NF-κB, iNOS, and COX-2 in the cerebellum as well as the hippocampus (all P < 0.05). These results demonstrate the ameliorative effects of E100 on repetitive compulsive behaviors in a mouse model of ASD. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo demonstration of the effectiveness of a potent dual-active H3R antagonist and AChE inhibitor against autistic-like repetitive compulsive behaviors and neuroinflammation, and provides evidence for the role of such compounds in treating ASD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

LMV inhibits CMV replication by binding to the viral terminase complex. However, first cases of clinical LMV resistance have been occurred. Here we report a fast breakthrough of resistant cytomegalovirus during secondary LMV prophylaxis in a hematopoietic-cell transplant recipient.A 44-year-old male patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) experienced a CMV-reactivation within the first 4 weeks of allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation. Administration of LMV was initiated at day + 34. Due to increasing viral loads, LMV treatment was discontinued after 8 days. The patient was then administered with valganciclovir (valGCV) until viral DNA was undetectable. Due to neutropenia, valGCV treatment was switched to LMV secondary prophylaxis. For 4 weeks, the patient maintain virologic suppression. Then, CMV viral loads increased with a fast kinetic. Genotypic testing of the viral polymerase UL54, the kinase UL97 as well as the viral terminase UL56 and UL89 revealed the mutation C325Y in UL56, which is associated with the high level LMV resistance.It is known that Letermovir is approved for prophylactic purposes. However, it may be used for some patients with CMV infection who either have failed prior therapies or are unable to tolerate other anti-CMV compounds. Particularly, the administration of LMV should be avoided in patients with detectable viral loads. When this is not possible, viral load must be routinely monitored along with UL56 genotyping. Furthermore, LMV administration at high virus loads may foster the rapid selection of resistant CMV mutants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641822>HS-SPME-GC-MS approach for the analysis of  salivary metabolites and application in a case study for the indirect assessment of gut microbiota.</a></h1><p>In this work, a straightforward analytical approach based on headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was developed for the analysis of salivary  organic compounds without any prior derivatization step. With a sample volume of 500 μL, optimal conditions were achieved by allowing the sample to equilibrate for 10 min at 50 °C and then extracting the samples for 10 min at the same temperature, using a carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane fibre. The method allowed the simultaneous identification and quantification of 20 compounds in sample headspace, including short-chain   and their derivatives which are commonly analysed after analyte derivatization. The proof of applicability of the methodology was performed with a case study regarding the analysis of the dynamics of  metabolites in saliva of a single subject undergoing -day treatment with rifaximin antibiotic. Non-stimulated saliva samples were collected over 3 weeks from a nominally healthy volunteer before, during, and after antibiotic treatment. The variations of some metabolites, known to be produced by the microbiota and by bacteria that are susceptible to antibiotics, suggest that the study of the dynamics of salivary metabolites can be an excellent indirect method for analysing the gut microbiota. This approach is novel from an analytical standpoint, and it encourages further studies combining saliva metabolite profiles and gut microbiota dynamics.

It gives the functional value true (1) if both functional arguments (input signals) have the same logical value (0,0 or 1,1), and false (0) if they are different (0,1 or 1,0). The output signal producing reaction is catalyzed by pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ-GDH), which is inhibited at acidic and basic pH values. Two other reactions catalyzed by esterase and urease produce acetic acid and ammonium hydroxide, respectively, shifting solution pH from the optimum pH for PQQ-GDH to acidic and basic values (1,0 and 0,1 input combinations, respectively), thus switching the enzyme activity off (output 0). When the input signals are not applied (0,0 combination) or both applied compensating each other (1,1 combination) the optimum pH is preserved, thus keeping PQQ-GDH running at the high rate (output 1). The biocatalytic cascade mimicking the NXOR gate was characterized optically and electrochemically. In the electrochemical experiments the PQQ-GDH enzyme communicated electronically with a conducting electrode support, thus resulting in the electrocatalytic current when signal combinations 0,0 and 1,1 were applied. The logic gate operation, when it was realized electrochemically, was also extended to the biomolecular release controlled by the gate. The release system included two electrodes, one performing the NXOR gate and another one activated for the release upon electrochemically stimulated alginate hydrogel dissolution. The studied system represents a general approach to the biocatalytic realization of the NXOR logic gate, which can be included in different catalytic cascades mimicking operation of concatenated gates in sophisticated logic circuitries.© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Optimization of extraction conditions by a central composite experimental design revealed that the dilution of the alcohol content of  mL of Baijiu to 10%, followed by the addition of 1. g of NaCl and subsequent SPME Arrow extraction with DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber coating over 45 min at 45 °C was the most suitable. The quantitative method allowed the extraction and identification of 82 aroma compounds (esters, alcohols,  , aldehydes & ketones, furans, pyrazines, sulfur compounds, phenols, terpenes, and lactones) in the Baijiu sample. The method was validated with good repeatability, inter and intra-day precision (almost below 15%), and accuracy (almost in the range of 81.-119.96%). Furthermore, the method was validated successfully for the most significant compounds and was applied to study the composition of  compounds in different types of Baijiu. This research proved that SPME Arrow is an effective method for the extraction of aroma compounds in Baijiu and other distilled spirits. This developed method will allow improved analysis of other distilled spirits.Copyright © 2019.

Here we report a new approach to produce them from crude glycerol, by combining propionic acid fermentation with chain elongation. Propionic acid was produced by Propionibacterium acidipropionici (8.49 ± 1.40 g·L). In the subsequent mixed population chain elongation, valeric acid was the dominant product (.3 ± 0.69 g·L) of the chain elongation process. Residual glycerol negatively impacted the selectivity of mixed culture chain elongation towards valeric acid, whereas this was unaffected when Clostridium kluyveri was used as bio-catalyst. Valeric acid could be selectively isolated and upgraded to ethyl valerate by using dodecane as extractant and medium for esterification, whereas shorter-chain carboxylic  could be recovered by using a 10 wt% solution of trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) in dodecane. Overall, our work shows that the combined fermentation, electrochemistry and homogeneous catalysis enables fine chemical production from side streams.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The pathogenesis of acne is attributed to multiple factors, including altered sebum production, inflammatory processes, dysregulation of the hormone microenvironment, and the proliferation of the skin commensal bacteria, Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes). Androgens induce the proliferation and differentiation of sebocytes, (cells that comprise the sebaceous gland), help regulate the synthesis of the lipids that are incorporated into sebum and stimulate the production of cytokines that are found in inflammatory acne lesions. Several studies have established that clascoterone is a potent antiandrogen that is well tolerated and has selective topical activity. Its potency as an acne therapeutic is currently being analyzed in a large phase 3 clinical trial. The study described herein elucidates for the first time the mechanism of action of clascoterone. Clascoterone was found to bind the androgen receptor (AR) with high affinity in vitro, inhibit AR-regulated transcription in a reporter cell line, and antagonize androgen-regulated lipid and inflammatory cytokine production in a dose-dependent manner in human primary sebocytes. In particular, when compared to another AR antagonist, spironolactone, clascoterone was significantly better at inhibiting inflammatory cytokine synthesis from sebocytes. Therefore, clascoterone may be an excellent candidate to be the first topical antiandrogen to treat acne. J Drugs Dermatol. 2019;18():412-418.</p></html>
