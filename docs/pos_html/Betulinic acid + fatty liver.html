However, the pathogenesis of NAFLD remains to be elucidated, and no established therapeutic regimens for treating NAFLD exist. Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the main cellular energy sensor, has been implicated as a key regulator of hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism. Recently, emerging evidence indicates that many plant-derived natural products are capable of ameliorating NAFLD by targeting AMPK.The published literature in PubMed relating to this topic was searched through June 2016.Significant advances have been made with respect to understanding the protective effects of plant-derived natural products against NAFLD. A variety of natural products, including alkaloids (berberine, demethyleneberberine, nicotine, caffeine, etc.), polyphenols (resveratrol, puerarin, curcumin, caffeic acid, etc.) and other compounds (β- caryophyllene, gastrodin, compound K, , etc.), have demonstrated promising results in preclinical studies. Mechanistic studies of these compounds have focused on their activation of AMPK and its downstream effectors involved in lipid metabolism.The findings of this review confirm that plant-derived natural products capable of activating the AMPK signaling pathway are potential therapeutic agents for NAFLD.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23435355> alleviates non-alcoholic  by inhibiting SREBP1 activity via the AMPK-mTOR-SREBP signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is emerging as the most common  disease in industrialized countries. The discovery of food components that can ameliorate NAFLD is therefore of interest.  (BA) is a triterpenoid with many pharmacological activities, but the effect of BA on  is as yet unknown. To explore the possible anti- effects and their underlying mechanisms, we used insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, primary rat hepatocytes and  tissue from ICR mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Oil Red O staining revealed that BA significantly suppressed excessive triglyceride accumulation in HepG2 cells and in the livers of mice fed a HFD. Ca(+2)-calmodulin dependent protein kinase kinase (CAMKK) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) were both activated by BA treatment. In contrast, the protein levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and S6 kinase (S6K) were all reduced when hepatocytes were treated with BA for up to 24h. We found that BA activates AMPK via phosphorylation, suppresses SREBP1 mRNA expression, nuclear translocation and repressed SREBP1 target gene expression in HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes, leading to reduced lipogenesis and lipid accumulation. These effects were completely abolished in the presence of STO-609 (a CAMKK inhibitor) or compound C (an AMPK inhibitor), indicating that the BA-induced reduction in hepatic steatosis was mediated via the CAMKK-AMPK-SREBP1 signaling pathway. Taken together, our results suggest that BA effectively ameliorates intracellular lipid accumulation in  cells and thus is a potential therapeutic agent for the prevention of  disease.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The present study was conducted to determine whether  (BA) or betulin (BT) would ameliorate acute ethanol-induced fatty liver in mice, and to characterize whether Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were involved in ethanol-stimulated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). EtOH (5mg/kg) and BA or BT (20 or 50mg/kg) were applied in vivo, while EtOH (50mM) and BA or BT (12.5 or 25μM) were applied in vitro. Administration of BA or BT significantly prevented the increases of serum ALT and AST caused by ethanol, as well as serum TG. Supplement of BA or BT prevented ethanol-induced acidophilic necrosis, increased hepatocyte nuclei and stromal inflammation infiltration as indicated by liver histopathological studies. Administration of BA or BT significantly decreased CYP2E1 activities and expression of SREBP-1caused by ethanol, however, lower dosage of BA or BT showed slight effects on CYP2E1 activity or expression of SREBP-1c. BA or BT administration significantly decreased the expression of TLR4, and increased the phosphorylation of STAT3. In vitro, BA or BT treatment reduced the expressions of α-SMA and collagen-I in ethanol-stimulated HSCs via regulation of TLR4 and STAT3, coincided with in vivo. All of these findings demonstrated that BA or BT might ameliorate acute ethanol-induced fatty liver via TLR4 and STAT3 in vivo and in vitro, promising agents for ethanol-induced fatty liver therapies.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Br. Here we investigated the in vitro anticancer properties of BrA. We report that BrA inhibits acyl-coA: cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT) activity in rat liver microsomes in a concentration-dependent manner, blocking the biosynthesis of the cholesterol fatty acid ester tumour promoter. We next demonstrated that BrA inhibits ACAT in intact cancer cells with an IC of 12.6 ± 2.4 µM. BrA inhibited both clonogenicity and invasiveness of several cancer cell lines, establishing that BrA displays specific anticancer properties. BrA appears to be more potent than the other pentacyclic triterpenes,  and ursolic acid studied under similar conditions. The inhibitory effect of BrA was reversed by exogenous addition of cholesteryl oleate, showing that ACAT inhibition is responsible for the anticancer effect of BrA. This report reveals new anticancer properties for BrA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30635917> alleviates endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease through activation of farnesoid X receptors in mice.</a></h2><p>The molecular mechanism for the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains elusive. Both farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signalling and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contribute to the progression of NAFLD; however, it is not clear whether the actions of these two pathways are dependent on each other. Moreover, the pharmacological benefits and mechanism of  (BA) in controlling metabolic syndrome and NAFLD are largely unknown.A reporter assay and a time-resolved FRET assay were used to identify BA as an agonist of the FXR. NAFLD was induced by a methionine and choline-deficient L-amino acid diet (MCD) and high-fat diet (HFD). The pharmacological effects of BA (100 mg·kg ·day ) and potential interactions between hepatic FXR activation and ER stress pathways were evaluated by FXR silencing, Western blot and RT-PCR analyses using control and FXR mice.Activation of the FXR inhibited intracellular PERK/EIF2α/ATF4 and CHOP signalling, thereby alleviating hepatic ER stress, whereas FXR silencing resulted in an opposite effect. Furthermore, we identified BA as an FXR agonist that effectively attenuated the progression of NAFLD and metabolic disorders in both HFD- and MCD diet-fed mice and restored the hepatocellular ER homeostasis by stimulating the FXR signalling pathway and blocking PERK/EIF2α signalling. In contrast, the effects of BA were attenuated in FXR mice.Our data demonstrate that pharmacological activation of the FXR by BA reduces hepatocellular ER stress and attenuates NAFLD in an animal model of hepatic steatosis.© 2019 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30799179> inhibits high-fat diet-induced  and improves energy balance by activating AMPK.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndromes are prevalent worldwide and result in various complications including , cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes.  (BA) is a naturally occurring triterpenoid that has anti-inflammatory properties. We hypothesized that treatment with BA may result in decreased body weight gain, adiposity and hepatic steatosis in a diet-induced mouse model of .Mice fed a high-fat diet and treated with BA showed less weight gain and tissue adiposity without any change in calorie intake. Gene expression profiling of mouse tissues and cell lines revealed that BA treatment increased expression of lipid oxidative genes and decreased that of lipogenesis-related genes. This modulation was mediated by increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, which facilitates energy expenditure, lipid oxidation and thermogenic capacity and exerts protective effects against  and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Overall, BA markedly inhibited the development of  and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice fed a high-fat diet, and AMPK activation in various tissues and enhanced thermogenesis are two possible mechanisms underlying the antiobesity and antisteatogenic effects of BA.The current findings suggest that treatment with BA is a potential dietary strategy for preventing  and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.Copyright © 2018 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.
