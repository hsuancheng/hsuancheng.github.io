<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661484>[Pooled Human Immunoglobulin Preparations as Immunomodulating Drugs].</a></h2><p>It is time to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the first successful attempt to develop and use a specific high-titer antitoxic serum for treating diphtheria, a deadly infectious disease. This was followed by major advances in passive immunotherapy 75 years ago (production of pooled human IgG for subcutaneous injection) and 50 years ago (widespread technology for producing immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous administration). More than 200 tons of pooled human IgG are produced per year worldwide. The preparation is used primarily for IgG substitution in patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, as well as for an immunomodulating treatment of a growing number of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. These preparations contain the pooled IgG antibody repertoire of a large population of healthy plasma donors. This repertoire includes antibodies that neutralize pathogens and their factors of virulence, anti-idiotypic antibodies, and antibodies to other foreign and own proteins, as well as to carbohydrate antigens. Naturally polyspecific antibodies that are present in all healthy individuals play an important role as a first-line defense against bacteria and viruses. After exposure to protein-modifying agents, some IgG molecules can acquire the ability to bind novel structurally unrelated antigens. This phenomenon is referred to as induced polyspecificity. The list of these protein-modifying molecules was shown to include low-pH buffers, free heme, pro-oxidative ferrous ions, reactive  species, etc. Such modified antibody preparations may have a therapeutic potential, since their administration to animals with experimental sepsis or aseptic systemic response syndromes significantly improved survival rates, while the same dose of the native preparation had no effect. We also hypothesize that the aggressive protein-modifying molecules released in sites of inflammation and tissue damage could also modify the antigen-binding behavior of surface immunoglobulin B cell receptors and the structurally related T cell receptors. This "specificity editing" of both types of receptors may play a major role in the body's defense mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657888>Pharmacologic and Nonpharmacologic Therapies in Adult Patients With Exacerbation of COPD: A Systematic Review [Internet].</a></h2><p>To synthesize existing knowledge about the effectiveness and harms of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ECOPD).Embase, Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE Daily, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Registrar of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus from database inception to January 2, 2019.We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated pharmacologic intervention or nonpharmacologic interventions for ECOPD. The strength of evidence (SOE) was graded for critical final health outcomes.We included 98 RCTs (13,401 patients, mean treatment duration 9.9 days, mean followup 3.7 months). Final health outcomes, including mortality, resolution of exacerbation, hospital readmissions, repeat exacerbations, and need for intubation, were infrequently evaluated and often showed no statistically significant differences between groups. Antibiotic therapy increases the clinical cure rate and reduces the clinical failure rate regardless of the severity of ECOPD (moderate SOE). There is insufficient evidence to support a particular antibiotic regimen. Oral and intravenous corticosteroids improve dyspnea and reduce the clinical failure rate (low SOE). Despite the ubiquitous use of inhaled bronchodilators in ECOPD, we found only a small number of trials that assessed lung function tests, and not final health outcomes. The evidence is insufficient to support the effect of aminophyllines, magnesium sulfate, mucolytics, inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled antibiotics, -lipoxygenase inhibitor, and statins on final health outcomes. Titrated  reduces mortality compared with high flow  (low SOE). Low SOE suggested benefit from some nonpharmacologic interventions such as chest physiotherapy using vibration/percussion/massage or breathing technique (on dyspnea), resistance training (on dyspnea and quality of life), early pulmonary rehabilitation commenced before hospital discharge during the initial most acute phase of exacerbation rather than the convalescence period (on dyspnea) and whole body vibration training (on quality of life). Vitamin D supplementation may improve quality of life (low SOE).Although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a common condition, the evidence base for most interventions in ECOPD remains limited. Systemic antibiotics and corticosteroids are associated with improved outcomes in mild and moderate to severe ECOPD. Titrated  reduces mortality. Future research is required to assess the effectiveness of several emerging nonpharmacologic and dietary treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669219>Benzimidazole-based dual dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and xanthine oxidase inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Multiple-targeting compounds might reduce complex polypharmacy of multifactorial diseases, such as diabetes, and contribute to the greater therapeutic success. Targeting reactive  species-producing enzymes, as xanthine oxidase (XO), might suppress progression of diabetes-associated vascular complications. In this study a small series of benzimidazole derivatives (1-9) was evaluated for inhibitory activity against dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) and XO. One 1,3-disubstituted-benzimidazole-2-imine () and 1,3-thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazolone derivative (8) were shown as effective dual DPP-4 and XO inhibitors, with IC values lower than 200 μM, and predicted binding modes with both target enzymes. Both selected dual inhibitors (compounds  and 8) did not show cytotoxicity to a greater extent on Caco-2 cells even at concentration of 250 μM. These structures represent new non-purine scaffolds bearing two therapeutic functionalities, being DPP-4 and XO inhibitors, more favorable in comparison to DPP-4 inhibitors with DPP-4 as a single target due to pleiotropic effects of XO inhibition.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The receptor responsible for succinate signalling, SUCNR1 (also known as GPR91), is a member of the G-protein-coupled-receptor family and links succinate signalling to renin-induced hypertension, retinal angiogenesis and inflammation. Because SUCNR1 senses succinate as an immunological danger signal-which has relevance for diseases including ulcerative colitis, liver fibrosis, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis-it is of interest as a therapeutic target. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of rat SUCNR1 in complex with an intracellular binding nanobody in the inactive conformation. Structure-based mutagenesis and radioligand-binding studies, in conjunction with molecular modelling, identified key residues for species-selective antagonist binding and enabled the determination of the high-resolution crystal structure of a humanized rat SUCNR1 in complex with a high-affinity, human-selective antagonist denoted NF-56-EJ40. We anticipate that these structural insights into the architecture of the succinate receptor and its antagonist selectivity will enable structure-based drug discovery and will further help to elucidate the function of SUCNR1 in vitro and in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668884>[Causes, diagnosis and treatments of circulatory shocks].</a></h2><p>Shock states are the leading causes of intensive care admission and are nowadays associated with high morbidity and mortality. They are driven by a complex physiopathology and most frequently a multifactorial mechanism. They can be separated in whether a decrease of  delivery (quantitative shock) or an abnormal cell distribution of cardiac output (distributive shock). Septic, cardiogenic and hypovolemic shocks represent more than 80% of shock etiologies. Clinical presentation is mostly characterized by frequent arterial hypotension and sign of poor clinical perfusion. Hyperlactatemia occurs in most of shock states. The diagnostic of shock or earlier reversible "pre-shock" states is urgent in order to initiate adequate therapy. Therefore, orientation and therapies must be discussed with intensive care physiologists in a multidisciplinary approach. Etiologic investigation and correction is a primary concern. Hemodynamic and respiratory support reflect another part of initial therapy toward normalization of cell oxygenation. Fluid resuscitation is the corner stone part of initial therapy of any form of shock. Vasoconstrictive drugs or inotropic support still often remain necessary. The primary goal of initial resuscitation should be not only to restore blood arterial pressure but also to improve clinical perfusion markers. On the biological side, decrease of lactate concentration is associated with better outcome.Copyright © 2019 Société Nationale Française de Médecine Interne (SNFMI). Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Wastewater with TC may have an adverse effect on ecosystems. Riboflavin-'-phosphate (FMN or flavin mononucleotide) is a non-toxic product of the phosphorylation of vitamin B and is required for the proper functioning of the humans. FMN is sensitized to ultraviolet (UV) and blue light radiation, as evidenced by the generation of reactive  species (ROS). This study inspects feasible applications of blue light on FMN so as to develop a valid way of degrading TC by FMN photolysis. We used the increased rate of bacterial survival as a practical indicator of antibiotic degradation. TC in the presence of FMN solution decomposed completely after 20 W/m of blue light irradiation (TCF treatment), and the degradation of TC (D-TCF) occurred after the photolytic process. After TCF treatment, colony-forming units (CFUs) of  ( were determined for the D-TCF solution. The CFU of  preservation was 93.2% of the D-TCF solution (50 μg/mL of TC in the presence of 114 μg/mL of FMN solution treated with 20 W/m of blue light irradiation at 25 °C for 1 h) cultivation. The mass spectrum of D-TCF showed diagnostic ion signals at m/z 431.0 and 414.0 Da. The molecular formula of D-TCF was CHNO, and the exact mass was 430.44 g/mol. TC degradation by FMN photolysis can significantly decrease the antimicrobial ability of TC. The results expressed here regarding the influence of FMN photolysis on TC degradation offer an environmentally sound wastewater treatment method.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658364>Icariside II, a phosphodiesterase  inhibitor, attenuates cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by inhibiting GSK-3β-mediated activation of autophagy.</a></h2><p>Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is always exacerbated neuronal damage when timely restoring cerebral blood flow after ischemia stroke. Cerebral I/R results in excessive autophagy and neuronal demise. The present study was designed to explore the role of autophagy during ICS II-mediated neuroprotection on cerebral I/R in vivo and in vitro.The rat focal cerebral ischemia was induced 2 h of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion with ICS II, 3-MA or Rapamycin. The effect of ICS II was detemined using neurological behaviour and cerebral infarction. The expressions of phosphodiesterase  (PDE ), autophagy-related proteins and phosphorylation levels of GSK-3β were determined. Primary rat cortical neurons were subjected to  and glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) were applied to further elucidate the mechanism of ICS II on cerebral (I/R). A surface plasmon resonance assay and molecular docking were used to explore the interactions of ICS II with PDE  or GSK-3β.ICS II not only protected against MCAO-induced injury in rats, but also attenuated primary cortical neurons injury upon OGD/R. The neuroprotective effects of ICS II on cerebral I/R were attributed to mediating PKG/GSK-3β/autophagy axis. ICS II directly bound to PDE  and GSK-3β, and there also existed the interaction between PKG and GSK-3β.These findings indicate that ICS II attenuates cerebral I/R-induced injury via mediating PKG/GSK-3β/autophagy axis. This study will raise the possibility that ICS II may be exploited into a potent PDE  inhibitor against ischemia stroke.This article is protected by copyright.

A pulse oximeter and a near-infrared spectroscopy probes were connected to babies during the study period and babies were recorded by video, from which the crying time, and Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), were obtained. The heart rate (HR), peripheral  saturation (SpO2) and rScO2 data were sampled every 1 second and exported to a personal computer via digital output during the study period. The maximum HR, the minimum SpO2, peak, baseline and mean rScO2 measurements following skin puncture were recorded. Data was compared within one group and between the two groups.After the heel prick, crying time (P<0.001) and NIPS scores (P=0.024) increased and SpO2 levels decreased significantly (P=0.012) in the study group versus the control group. Although mean rScO2 increased significantly within one group (P<0.001), it was not significant between the two groups. The percent change in rScO2 was greater in the study group [.2 (2.-9.3)] compared to the control group [2.8(1.1-8.2), P=0.037)].We showed that rScO2 values changed significantly within the first few days of life in babies who received more painful stimuli compared to the control group, similar to behavioral and physiological responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655324>Nocturnal dialysis improves sleep apnea more than daytime dialysis: a meta-analysis of crossover studies.</a></h2><p>To systematically review the literature for articles evaluating differences in polysomnography (PSG) data when patients are on primarily daytime hemodialysis (conventional hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis) versus nocturnal hemodialysis (nocturnal hemodialysis or nocturnal peritoneal dialysis). Then to perform a meta-analysis on the available PSG data, specifically evaluating differences in apnea hypopnea index (AHI) and mean saturation of  (SpO) between these two groups.Two authors systematically searched MEDLINE/Pubmed, Scopus, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane. Searches were performed through December 6, 2018.A total of four adult crossover studies (91 patients, age 50.4 ± 12.4, BMI 25.1 ± .3) reported PSG data. The daytime hemodialysis (DHD) and nocturnal hemodialysis (NHD) AHI decreased from 24.6 ± 18.2 to 12.6 ± 11.8 (events/hour) with a mean difference of -11.9 [95% CI -13.47, -10.37], Z score of 15.07 (P < 0.00001). The standardized mean difference was -1.35 [95% CI -2.70, 0.01]. Two studies reported mean SpO changes during PSG. The DHD and NHD SpO increased from 92.7 ± 2.4 to 94.7 ± 2.2 with a mean difference of 2.26 [95% CI -0.18, 4.71], Z score 1.82 (P = 0.07).In the current literature, nocturnal hemodialysis improves AHI more than daytime hemodialysis. A trend towards improvement in mean SpO with nocturnal dialysis was noted, but did not reach statistical significance. Consideration can be given for transitioning patients who have end stage renal disease and sleep apnea from daytime to nocturnal hemodialysis as an adjunct to other treatment modalities.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667369>Culture of  using indigenous floral extract in the hilly terrains of Koraput district of Odisha, India.</a></h2><p>An experimental design for culturing  in four experimental ponds of size 25 m was taken up in Koraput district of Odisha, India. The ponds were filled with water and  PL were released in the ponds with stocking density @ 4 m. Ponds 1 and 2 were fed with Conventional Feed (fish meal) and ponds 3 and 4 were fed with Formulated Feed (Soybean +  + ). Water quality parameters like surface water temperature, pH, dissolved , transparency, nitrate, phosphate and silicate, chlorophyll  and organic carbon were monitored for 195 days. Significant variation (p < 0.05) in the water quality parameters were observed during the culture period between ponds respectively. Growth parameters like daily growth rate (DGR), specific growth rate (SGR) and condition index (CI) were monitored simultaneously which showed a discrete growth during the first 90 days and then a stable growth form. Length and weight relationship of prawns were calculated for all the culture ponds which showed highly positive relationship (p < 0.01) proving unique contribution of feed towards the growth of prawns. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) values (Ranging from 2.74 ± .05 to 2.95 ± 0.04) also proved the greater acceptance of feed towards the growth of prawns. Biochemical analysis of the feed and prawn (protein, carbohydrate, lipid and astaxanthin) also proved the feed efficiency towards growth and coloration of prawn.

We investigated the safety of naringenin, its effects on metabolic rate, and blood glucose and insulin responses in a single female subject with diabetes. The subject ingested 150 mg naringenin from an extract of whole oranges standardized to 28% naringenin three times/day for 8 weeks, and maintained her usual food intake. Body weight, resting metabolic rate, respiratory quotient, and blood chemistry panel including glucose, insulin, and safety markers were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks. Adverse events were evaluated every 2 weeks. We also examined the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase G (PKG) in the response of human adipocytes to naringenin treatment. Compared to baseline, the body weight decreased by 2.3 kg. The metabolic rate peaked at 3.% above baseline at 1 h, but there was no change in the respiratory quotient. Compared to baseline, insulin decreased by 18%, but the change in glucose was not clinically significant. Other blood safety markers were within their reference ranges, and there were no adverse events.  and  mRNA expression was reduced by inhibitors of PPAR and PPAR, but there was no effect of PKA or PKG inhibition. We conclude that naringenin supplementation is safe in humans, reduces body weight and insulin resistance, and increases metabolic rate by PPAR and PPAR activation. The effects of naringenin on energy expenditure and insulin sensitivity warrant investigation in a randomized controlled clinical trial.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642128>Expression of a dominant-negative AtNEET-H89C protein disrupts iron-sulfur metabolism and iron homeostasis in Arabidopsis.</a></h2><p>Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters play an essential role in plants as protein co-factors mediating diverse electron transfer reactions. Because they can react with  to form reactive  species (ROS) and inflict cellular damage, the biogenesis of Fe-S clusters is highly regulated. A recently discovered group of 2Fe-2S proteins, termed NEET proteins, was proposed to coordinate iron-sulfur, iron, and ROS homeostasis in mammalian cells. Here we report that disrupting the function of AtNEET, the sole member of the NEET protein family in Arabidopsis thaliana, triggers a leaf-associated Fe-S- and Fe- deficiency responses, elevated iron content in chloroplasts (1.2-1. fold), chlorosis, structural damage to chloroplasts, and a high seedling mortality rate. Our findings suggest that disrupting AtNEET function disrupts the transfer of 2Fe-2S clusters from the chloroplastic 2Fe-2S biogenesis pathway to different cytosolic and chloroplastic Fe-S proteins, as well as to the cytosolic Fe-S biogenesis system, and that uncoupling this process triggers a leaf-associated Fe-S- and Fe-deficiency responses that result in iron accumulation in chloroplasts and enhanced ROS accumulation. We further show that AtNEET transfers its 2Fe-2S clusters to DRE2, a key protein of the cytosolic Fe-S biogenesis system, and propose that the availability of 2Fe-2S clusters in the chloroplast and cytosol is linked to iron homeostasis in plants.© 2019 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642100>3-Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid attenuated oxidative glutamate toxicity in neuron-like cell lines by apoptosis inhibition.</a></h2><p>3-Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), a pentacyclic triterpenic acid present in gum resin of Boswellia serrata, has been found to possess antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. In this study, we aimed to examine protective properties of AKBA against glutamate-induced neuronal injury. To investigate the effects of AKBA (2.-10 µM) on glutamate injury in neuron-like cells PC12 and N2a, two treatment regimens (incubation for 2 or 0 hours before glutamate exposure) were used. Then, the 3-(4,-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method was used to determine viability of the cells. Cellular redox status was evaluated using fluorimetry and comet assays. Annexin V/propidium iodide double staining and Western blot analysis of relative apoptotic proteins were conducted. Based on the results, 24 hours incubation with glutamate (8 mM) increased the cell mortality of PC12 and N2a (P < .001). However, AKBA (2.-10 µM) enhanced the cell viability in both treatment regimens (P < .001). Also co- and pretreatment with AKBA significantly attenuated lipid peroxidation, reactive  species production, and DNA injury (P < .05 and P < .001). AKBA also restored the activity of cellular superoxide dismutase under glutamate toxicity; this effect was seen to be more significant during the pretreatment regimen (P < .001). Moreover, Western blot analysis indicated that AKBA inhibited glutamate-induced programmed cell death through depressing the elevation of the expression ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and cleaved-caspase-3 proteins, concentration-dependently. Overall, the present findings suggest the neuroprotective activities of AKBA against glutamate-induced cell injury probably by inhibiting oxidative damage and reducing apoptotic cell death.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662993>Manganese-Doped Cerium Oxide Nanocomposite Induced Photodynamic Therapy in MCF-7 Cancer Cells and Antibacterial Activity.</a></h2><p>In this experimental approach, we explored the structures, morphologies, phototoxicities, and antibacterial activities of undoped and Mn-doped ceria nanocomposite materials, Mn  Ce O The Mn  Ce O nanocomposites were synthesized by employing a soft chemical route. Our prime focus was on the influence of different factors, both physical and chemical, i.e., the concentration of manganese in the product, size of the nanocomposite, drug dose, and incubation time, on the bacterial strains. Different bacterial strains were selected as experimental biological models of the antibacterial activity of the manganese-doped cerium oxide nanocomposite. In addition to the photodynamic response, the adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7) was also studied. Based on cell viability losses and bacterial inhibition analyses, the precise mechanisms of apoptosis or necrosis of -ALA/PpIX-exposed MCF-7 cells under 630 nm red lights and under dark conditions were elucidated. It was observed that the undoped nanocomposites had lower cytotoxicities and inhibitions compared with those of the doped nanocomposites towards pathogens. The antibacterial activity and effectiveness for photodynamic therapy were enhanced in the presence of the manganese-doped ceria nanocomposite, which could be attributed to the correlation of the maximum reactive  species generation for targeted toxicity and maximum antioxidant property in bacteria growth inhibition. The optimized cell viability dose and doping concentration will be beneficial for treating cancer and bacterial infections in the future.Copyright © 2019 M.

From January 2012 to March 2017, 15 male patients (aged 26-53 years) hospitalized in our burn ward with Hurley's stage Ⅲ HS in the buttocks recurred after 2- operations who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the prospective self pre- and post-control study. After extensive resection of the lesion, continuous VSD combined with intermittent irrigation of -loaded fluid was given, with negative pressure of -16.7 kPa and flow rate of pure  of 1.0 L/min. After 7 days of treatment with VSD combined with irrigation of -loaded fluid, the negative pressure device was removed and autologous posterior thigh split-thickness skin grafts and/or local flaps were transplanted to repair the wounds. Six patients were performed with split-thickness skin grafting, 4 patients with local flap transplantation, and  patients with split-thickness skin grafting together with local flap transplantation. The donor sites of local flaps were sutured directly or transplanted with autologous posterior thigh split-thickness skin grafts, and the donor sites of split-thickness skin grafts with autologous thin split-thickness scalp. The wound tissue or wound granulation tissue was collected before lesion resection and 7 days after treatment with VSD combined with irrigation of -loaded fluid respectively for bacterial culture and detecting of the content of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Survival of skin grafts and flaps after operation was observed, hospitalization time was recorded, and recurrence and complications of HS were followed up. Data were processed with paired sample  test.  Bacterial culture result of wound tissue before lesion resection was positive in all patients, mainly  and anaerobic bacteria, etc., while that of wound granulation tissue after 7 days of treatment with VSD combined with irrigation of -loaded fluid was negative. The content of TNF-α in wound granulation tissue after 7 days of treatment with VSD combined with irrigation of -loaded fluid was (10.1±2.9) pg/L, significantly lower than (73.6±.6) pg/L before lesion resection (=33.47, <0.01). The skin grafts and/or flaps of 15 patients survived post operation, and the wounds were healed. The patients were hospitalized for 17-31 days. During follow-up of 1 to  years, no recurrence of HS occurred in operative site of buttocks of 15 patients, but 1 patient had ulceration of healed perianal incision caused by high anal fistula and was healed after treatment.  Sequential treatment with extensive resection, VSD combined with irrigation of -loaded fluid, and tissue transplantation can thoroughly remove HS lesions in the buttocks and improve the condition of wound bed for skin acceptance after debridement, which is conducive to the cure of HS in the buttocks which has undergone multiple operations but still recurs after operation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662429>Changes in the Composition of the Gut Microbiota and the Blood Transcriptome in Preterm Infants at Less than 29 Weeks Gestation Diagnosed with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia.</a></h2><p>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung condition in preterm infants that results in abnormal lung development and leads to considerable morbidity and mortality, making BPD one of the most common complications of preterm birth. We employed RNA sequencing and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to profile gene expression in blood and the composition of the fecal microbiota in infants born at <29 weeks gestational age and diagnosed with BPD in comparison to those of preterm infants that were not diagnosed with BPD. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, performed longitudinally on 255 fecal samples collected from 50 infants in the first months of life, identified significant differences in the relative levels of abundance of , and  in the BPD infants in a manner that was birth mode dependent. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis revealed that more than 400 genes were upregulated in infants with BPD. Genes upregulated in BPD infants were significantly enriched for functions related to red blood cell development and  transport, while several immune-related pathways were downregulated. We also identified a gene expression signature consistent with an enrichment of immunosuppressive CD71 early erythroid cells in infants with BPD. Intriguingly, genes that were correlated in their expression with the relative abundances of specific taxa in the microbiota were significantly enriched for roles in the immune system, suggesting that changes in the microbiota might influence immune gene expression systemically. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious inflammatory condition of the lung and is the most common complication associated with preterm birth. A large body of evidence now suggests that the gut microbiota can influence immunity and inflammation systemically; however, the role of the gut microbiota in BPD has not been evaluated to date. Here, we report that there are significant differences in the gut microbiota of infants born at <29 weeks gestation and subsequently diagnosed with BPD, which are particularly pronounced when infants are stratified by birth mode. We also show that erythroid and immune gene expression levels are significantly altered in BPD infants. Interestingly, we identified an association between the composition of the microbiota and immune gene expression in blood in early life. Together, these findings suggest that the composition of the microbiota may influence the risk of developing BPD and, more generally, may shape systemic immune gene expression.Copyright © 2019 Ryan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663723>Tetra-2,3-pyrazinoporphyrazines with Peripherally Appended Pyridine Rings. 20. Mono- and Pentanuclear Al and Ga Complexes: Synthesis and Physicochemical and Photoactivity Studies.</a></h2><p>The autocyclotetramerization of the precursor 2,3-dicyano-,6-di(2'-pyridyl)pyrazine [(CN)PyPyz] in the presence of MCl compounds (M = Al, Ga) leads to the formation of the new mononuclear porphyrazine complexes [PyTPyzPzMCl]·HO (PyTPyzPz = tetrakis-2,3-[,6-di(2-pyridyl)pyrazino]porphyrazinato anion). From these species, the hydroxide analogues [PyTPyzPzMOH]·HO were obtained by contact with hot water, and their corresponding pentanuclear species [(PdCl)PyTPyzPzMCl]·HO could be easily formed by the reaction with PdCl. Physicochemical characterization of the mono- and pentanuclear macrocycles was based on elemental analysis, and mass, powder X-ray, and IR spectra. UV-vis spectral studies of the mononuclear species in solutions of DMF, DMSO, or pyridine ( ≈ 10-10 M) indicate (mainly in DMF and DMSO) the initial presence of aggregation, in some cases accompanied by the concomitant occurrence for the complex of a one-electron reduction. While disaggregation into a single species evolves spontaneously over time, the -1 charged species, eventually also found present, can be brought back to its neutral form by addition of a slight amount of HCl, the final spectrum showing the presence of the starting neutral species in its pure monomeric form. Similar aspects were faced also for the parent pentanuclear complexes. Cyclic voltammetry experiments, conducted for the mono-/pentanuclear complexes in DMF and DMSO ( ≈ 10 M), exhibit progressive one-electron reductions (1 → 4) characterized by  values (V vs SCE) positioned to significantly less negative values than those known for the phthalocyanine (Pc) analogues, these data confirming the previously already proven higher electron-deficient character of the M derivatives of the PyTPyzPz macrocycle with respect to Pc. The role of the present new series of Al and Ga macrocyclic species to act as photosensitizers for the generation of singlet , O, the cytotoxic agent in the anticancer treatment known as photodynamic therapy (PDT), has been explored in DMF/HCl. Among the quantum yields Φ, the value found for the Ga complex [PyTPyzPzGaCl] (0.68), practically coincident with that observed for the TTDPz analogue (0.69), is well above those of most porphyrazines analogues (Φ = 0.4-0.6), a result encouraging further research work for potential applications in the biochemical field.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657336>[Meta-analysis of clinical efficacy of Helmet non-invasive ventilation and  therapy on patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure].</a></h2><p>To systematically evaluate the clinical efficacies of Helmet non-invasive ventilation and  therapy on patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure.The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for comparison of efficacy between Helmet non-invasive ventilation and  therapy for treatment of patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure published by Wanfang database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biology Medicine (CBM), PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were retrieved. The retrieval time was from the establishment of database to February 1st, 2019. The indexes of the study outcomes included oxygenation index, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO), endotracheal intubation rate, hospital mortality and intolerance rate. Literature search and data extraction was performed separately by two researchers. Quality assessment of literature was conducted according to the risk of bias criterion provided by Cochrane collaboration net. The extractive data were Meta-analyzed by RevMan .1.0. Funnel plot and Egger regression analysis was employed to detect publication bias.Six RCTs including  English studies and 1 Chinese study were selected. Finally, 547 patients were enrolled, with 270 patients in Helmet non-invasive ventilation group and 277 in  therapy group. The study quality assessment revealed that the overall risk of bias was low, and no publication bias was detected by the funnel plot and Egger regression analysis. Meta-analysis showed that the oxygenation index in Helmet non-invasive ventilation group was significantly higher than that in  therapy group [mean difference (MD) = 73.47, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 52.01 to 94.92, P = 0.000 01], and PaCO (MD = -2.46, 95%CI was -4.54 to -0.39, P = 0.02), endotracheal intubation rate [relative risk ratio (RR) = 0.38, 95%CI was 0.20 to 0.73, P = 0.004] and hospital mortality (RR = 0.35, 95%CI was 0.19 to 0.65, P = 0.000 8) in Helmet non-invasive ventilation group were significantly lower than those in  therapy group. There was no significant difference in patient's intolerance between the two groups (RR = 2.38, 95%CI was 0.74 to 7.67, P = 0.15).Compared with  therapy, the Helmet non-invasive ventilation used for treatment of patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure can effectively improve the oxygenation index, decrease the PaCO, reduce the endotracheal intubation rate and hospital mortality, and the patients are well tolerated to the Helmet method.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661109>Spontaneous wrinkle emergence in nascent eumelanin thin films.</a></h2><p>Self-patterning processes originated by physical stimuli have been extensively documented in thin films, whereas spontaneous wrinkling phenomena due to chemical transformation processes are, to the best of our knowledge, unprecedented. Herein we report a case of spontaneous polymerization-driven surface nano-patterning (∼500 nm) that develops in smooth thin solid films of ,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI), a major precursor of eumelanin polymers, over a time scale of 30 to 60 days in air at room temperature. The phenomenon can be observed only above a critical film thickness of ∼250 nm and it is affected by exposure to ammonia vapors causing acceleration of the oxidation process. The thickness-dependent onset of wrinkling can be attributed to non-homogeneous rates of oxidation through the film causing slow swelling/expansion of the inner layers followed by fast stiffening and cross-linking in the outer layer exposed to higher  levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654830>Antioxidant response to cadmium exposure in primary skeletal muscle cells isolated from humans and elephant seals.</a></h2><p>Cadmium (Cd) occurs naturally; however, its concentration can increase with anthropogenic activities. Excess Cd increases reactive  species (ROS) production and oxidative damage, which can lead to pathological conditions. Marine mammals accumulate Cd in the liver and the kidney; yet, there are no reports of Cd-associated tissue damage in whales, seals or dolphins. Response to Cd exposure (0-.0 μM CdCl for 1-12 h) was analyzed and compared in primary skeletal muscle cells isolated from northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) and humans (Homo sapiens). Antioxidant enzyme activities (glutathione S-transferase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase), glutathione concentration, and protein carbonyl levels (an indicator of oxidative damage) were quantified. Glutathione levels were higher in northern elephant seal than in human cells. Protein carbonyl content in cells exposed to Cd was lower and had a smaller variability range in elephant seals than in humans. Generalized linear models (GLIM) identified Cd exposure and antioxidant defenses as significant contributors to protein carbonyl variability in human but not in elephant seal cells. These results suggest that the previously observed differences in circulating and tissue glutathione levels between marine and terrestrial mammals are maintained under cell culture conditions and that northern elephant seal and human muscle cells respond differently to Cd exposure. The results also suggest that the observed differences could potentially be associated with the protective mechanisms that allow northern elephant seals to tolerate extreme conditions that result in increased ROS generation (e.g. diving, sleep apnea, fasting) with no oxidative damage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

On this occasion, we are reviewing the major landmark clinical trials that were initiated by the NHLBI's Division of Lung Disease and that have had substantial impact on our understanding of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and how it is best treated. Although some of these trials did not show hypothesized treatment benefits for COPD, they have enabled clinicians to provide care for individuals with COPD relying on the most rigorous evidence. The  trials that are reviewed here are: the Intermittent Positive Pressure Breathing Trial, the Nocturnal  Treatment Trial, the Lung Health Study, the National Emphysema Treatment Trial, and the Long-term  Treatment Trial. These clinical trials have not only set the standards for COPD care but have served as models for the state-of-the-art conduct of clinical research in COPD.JCOPDF © 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641959>Effects of high-flow nasal cannula and non-invasive ventilation on inspiratory effort in hypercapnic patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a preliminary study.</a></h2><p>Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is preferred as the initial ventilatory support to treat acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) may be an alternative method; however, the effects of HFNC in hypercapnic COPD are not well known. This preliminary study aimed at assessing the physiologic effects of HFNC at different flow rates in hypercapnic COPD and to compare it with NIV.A prospective physiologic study enrolled 12 hypercapnic COPD patients who had initially required NIV, and were ventilated with HFNC at flow rates increasing from 10 to 50 L/min for 15 min in each step. The primary outcome was the effort to breathe estimated by a simplified esophageal pressure-time product (sPTP). The other studied variables were respiratory rate,  saturation (SpO), and transcutaneous CO pressure (PtcCO).Before NIV initiation, the median [interquartile range] pH was 7.36 [7.28-7.37] with a PaCO of 51 [42-60] mmHg. sPTP per minute was significantly lower with HFNC at 30 L/min than 10 and 20 L/min (p < 0.001), and did not significantly differ with NIV (median inspiratory/expiratory positive airway pressure of 11 [10-12] and [-] cmHO, respectively). At 50 L/min, sPTPes per minute increased compared to 30 L/min half of the patients. Respiratory rate was lower (p = 0.003) and SpO was higher (p = 0.028) with higher flows (30-50 L/min) compared to flow rate of 10 L/min and not different than with NIV. No significant differences in PtcCO between NIV and HFNC at different flow rates were observed (p = 0.335).Applying HFNC at 30 L/min for a short duration reduces inspiratory effort in comparison to 10 and 20 L/min, and resulted in similar effect than NIV delivered at modest levels of pressure support in hypercapnic COPD with mild to moderate exacerbation. Higher flow rates reduce respiratory rate but sometimes increase the effort to breathe. Using HFNC at 30 L/min in hypercapnic COPD patients should be further evaluated.

Evidence for the formation of Al-O-Al and Al-NBO bonds in the glass composition 38.7CaO-9.7MgO-12.9Al2O3-38.7SiO2 (CMAS, mol%) has been provided based on Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Analyses in the short-range order confirm that silicon and the majority of aluminium cations form regular tetrahedra. Well-separated homonuclear (Si-O-Si) and heteronuclear (Si-O-Al) cluster regions have been identified. In addition, a channel region (C-Region), separated from the network region, enriched with both NBO and non-framework modifier cations, has also been identified. These findings are in support of the previously proposed extended modified random network (EMRN) model for aluminosilicate glasses. A detailed analysis of the structural distributions revealed that a majority of Al, 51.6%, is found in Si-O-Al links. Although the formation of Al-O-Al and Al-NBO bonds is energetically less favourable, a significant amount of Al is found in Al-O-Al links (33.%), violating Lowenstein's rule, and the remainder is bonded with non-bridging  (NBO) in the form of Al-NBO (Al-O-(Ca, Mg)). The conditions necessary for the formation of less favourable bonds are attributed to the presence of a high amount of modifier cations in current CMAS glass and their preferable coordination.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657929> Formed IrLi Nanoparticles as Active Cathode Material in Li- Batteries.</a></h2><p>Lithium- (Li-O2) batteries are a promising class of rechargeable Li batteries with a potentially very high achievable energy density. One of the major challenges for Li-O2 batteries is the high charge overpotential, which results in a low energy efficiency. In this work size-selected subnanometer Ir clusters are used to investigate cathode materials that can help control lithium superoxide formation during discharge, which has good electronic conductivity needed for low charge potentials. It is found that Ir particles can lead to lithium superoxide formation as the discharge product with Ir particle sizes of ~1. nm giving the lowest charge potentials. During discharge these 1. nm Ir nanoparticles surprisingly evolve to larger ones while incorporating Li to form core-shell structures with Ir3Li shells, which probably act as templates for growth of lithium superoxide during discharge. Various characterization techniques including DEMS, Raman, titration, and HRTEM are used to characterize the LiO2 discharge product and the evolution of the Ir nanoparticles. Density functional calculations are used to provide insight into the mechanism for formation of the core-shell Ir3Li particles. The in situ formed Ir3Li core-shell nanoparticles discovered here provide a new direction for active cathode materials that can reduce charge overpotentials in Li-O2 batteries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670602>Iron Insufficiency Diminishes the Erythropoietic Response to Moderate Altitude Exposure.</a></h2><p>The effects of iron stores and supplementation on erythropoietic responses to moderate altitude in endurance athletes were examined. In a retrospective study, red cell compartment volume (RCV) responses to 4-weeks at 2,500m were assessed in athletes with low (n=9, ≤20 and ≤30 ng·ml for women and men, respectively) and normal (n=10) serum ferritin levels ([Ferritin]) without iron supplementation. In a subsequent prospective study, the same responses were assessed in athletes (n=26) with a protocol designed to provide sufficient iron before and during identical altitude exposure. The responses to a 4-week training camp at sea-level were assessed in another athletes (n=13) as controls. RCV and maximal  uptake (Vo) were determined at sea-level before and after intervention. In the retrospective study, athletes with low [Ferritin] did not increase RCV (27.0±2.9 to 27.±3.8 ml·kg, mean±SD, P=0.65) nor Vo (60.2±7.2 to 62.2±7. ml·kg·min, P=0.23) after 4-weeks at altitude, whereas athletes with normal [Ferritin] increased both (RCV: 27.3±3.1 to 29.8±2.4 ml·kg, P=0.002; Vo: 62.0±3.1 to 66.2±3.7 ml·kg·min, P=0.003). In the prospective study, iron supplementation normalized low [Ferritin] observed in athletes exposed to altitude (n=14) and sea-level (n=6) before the altitude/sea-level camp, and maintained [Ferritin] within normal range in all athletes while the camp. RCV and Vo increased in the altitude group, but remained unchanged in the sea-level group. Finally, the increase in RCV correlated with the increase in Vo (r=0.368, 95% CI: 0.059 to 0.612, P=0.022). Thus, iron deficiency in athletes restrains erythropoiesis to altitude exposure and may preclude improvement in sea-level athletic performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673323>Hierarchically porous carbons as supports for fuel cell electrocatalysts with atomically dispersed Fe-N  moieties.</a></h2><p>The development of high-performance non-platinum group metal (non-PGM) catalysts for the  reduction reaction (ORR) is still of significance in promoting the commercialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this work, a "hierarchically porous carbon (HPC)-supporting" approach was developed to synthesize highly ORR active Fe-phenanthroline (Fe-phen) derived Fe-N  -C catalysts. Compared to commercial carbon black supports, utilizing HPCs as carbon supports can not only prevent the formation of inactive iron nanoparticles during pyrolysis but also optimize the porous morphology of the catalysts, which eventually increases the amount of reactant-accessible and atomically dispersed Fe-N  active sites. The prepared catalyst therefore exhibits a remarkable ORR activity in both half-cells (half-wave potential of 0.80 V in 0.

BAL needs a wedge between the bronchoscope and the inner surface of the bronchus. The feasibility of performing BAL at the targeted position cannot be determined until immediately before the procedure. We examined BAL performed using a balloon catheter to evaluate the stability of the procedure itself and quality of the specimen obtained.The main inclusion criteria were diffuse lung disease with a shadow in the Ba area. The tip of a disposable balloon catheter was passed through the orifice of the Ba bronchus, and the balloon was expanded at the Ba bronchus. A 50-mL syringe containing saline was instilled, and gentle hand suction was performed. This procedure was repeated two more times (total: 150 mL).In all the 13 patients, the balloon of the catheter was inflated at the Ba bronchus. The median recovery rate was 34.92% ± 13.22%. These values were comparable to previously obtained BAL data (control group, N = 56) from our facility. The BAL fluid findings and final diagnosis, with the exception of one undiagnosed case, were consistent. Overall, four patients suffered an adverse event during BAL (hypoxemia). All cases were managed by increasing the  flow rate, and the adverse event did not affect the subsequent examinations.Using a balloon catheter enabled us to perform BAL at the intended bronchus.

The two molecular moieties of - are coupled via the sterically constrained 3',3″-positions of their two naphthalene units, so that the central biaryl linkage is rotationally hindered. With the two outer axes also being chiral, - possess three consecutive stereogenic axes. The four isolated dimers all have the same constitutions and identical absolute configurations at the four stereogenic centers, but differ by their axial chirality. They belong to the extremely small class of Dioncophyllaceae-type naphthylisoquinoline dimers, i.e., being devoid of  functions at C-6 and bearing the -configuration at C-3 in their isoquinoline portions. Besides these dimers, the plant produces predominantly typical Ancistrocladaceae-type monomeric compounds, i.e., with the -configuration at C-3 and an  function at C-6, such as the new ancistrobrevines K () and L (). Furthermore, a new hybrid-type (i.e., mixed Ancistrocladaceae/Dioncophyllaceae-type) alkaloid was identified, named ancistrobrevine M (), which is 3-configured and 6-oxygenated. Remarkable was the discovery of its "inverse hybrid-type" counterpart, dioncoline A (). It is the as yet only known 3-configured naphthylisoquinoline lacking an -functionality at C-6. The new jozibrevines A-C (-) exhibited pronounced antiplasmodial activities in the submicromolar range, with  being the most potent compound (IC, 0.012 μM). Furthermore, jozimine A () showed cytotoxicity against human colon carcinoma (HT-29), fibrosarcoma (HT1080), and multiple myeloma (MM.1S) cancer cells, displaying IC values of 12.0, 9.0, and .0 μM, respectively, whereas jozibrevines A () and B () were nontoxic in this concentration range.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667811>Glycogenolysis in Cerebral Cortex During Sensory Stimulation, Acute Hypoglycemia, and Exercise: Impact on Astrocytic Energetics, Aerobic Glycolysis, and Astrocyte-Neuron Interactions.</a></h2><p>Most glycogen in cerebral cortex is located in astrocytes, and the importance of glycogenolysis for critical functions, including neurotransmission and memory consolidation, is strongly supported by many studies. However, specific mechanisms through which glycogen sustains essential functions remain to be established by rigorous, quantitative studies. Cerebral cortical glycogen concentrations are in the range of 10-12 μmol/g in carefully-handled animals, and the calculated rate of glycogenolysis (CMR) during sensory stimulation is approximately 60% that of glucose utilization (CMR) by all cells, with lower rates during acute hypoglycemia and exercise to exhaustion. CMR is at least fourfold higher when the volume fraction of astrocytes is taken into account. Inclusion of glycogen consumed during sensory stimulation in calculation of the -glucose index (OGI = CMR/CMR, which has a theoretical maximum of 6 when no other substrates are metabolized) reduces OGI from .0 to 2.8. Thus, at least 53% of the carbohydrate is not oxidized, suggesting that glycogen mobilization supports astrocytic glycolysis, not neuronal oxidation of glycogen-derived lactate that would cause OGI to exceed 6. Failure of glycogenolysis to dilute the specific activity of lactate formed from blood-borne [6-C]glucose indicates compartmentation of glycolytic metabolism of glucose and glycogen and the rapid release from cerebral cortex of glycogen-derived lactate. Together, these findings invalidate the conclusion by others that glycogen-derived lactate is a major fuel for neurons during neurotransmission, memory consolidation, and exercise to exhaustion. Alternative mechanisms, including glucose sparing for neurons, are presented as testable explanations for data interpreted as lactate shuttling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662969>Intermittent Hypoxic Training at Lactate Threshold Intensity Improves Aiming Performance in Well-Trained Biathletes with Little Change of Cardiovascular Variables.</a></h2><p>The main objective of this research was to evaluate the efficacy of intermittent hypoxic training (IHT) on aiming performance and aerobic capacity in biathletes. Fourteen male biathletes were randomly divided into a hypoxia group (H) ( = 7), which trained three times per week in a normobaric hypoxic environment (FiO = 16.%, 2000 m a.s.l.) with lactate threshold intensity (LT) determined in hypoxia, and a control group (C) ( = 7), which exercised under normoxic conditions with LT intensity determined in normoxia. The training program included three weekly microcycles, followed by three days of recovery. The main part of the interval workout consisted of four 7 min (1 week), 8 min (2 week), or 9 min (3 week) running bouts at treadmill separated by 2 minutes of active recovery. After the warm-up and during the rest between the bouts, the athletes performed aiming to the target in the standing position with a sporting rifle (20 s). The results showed that the IHT caused a significant ( < 0.05) increase in retention time in the target at rest (RT9) by 14.4% in hypoxia, whereas RT postincremental test (RT9) increased by 27.4% in normoxia and 26.7% in hypoxia. No significant changes in this variable were found in group C. Additionally, the capillary  saturation at the end of the maximal effort (SO) in hypoxia increased significantly ( < 0.001) by ∼4% after IHT. The maximal workload during the incremental test (WR) in normoxia also increased significantly ( < 0.001) by 6.3% after IHT. Furthermore, in absolute and relative values of VO in normoxia, there was a propensity ( < 0.07) for increasing this value by % in group H. In conclusion, the main findings of this study showed a significant improvement in resting and postexercise aiming performance in normoxia and hypoxia. Furthermore, the results demonstrated beneficial effects of the IHT protocol on aerobic capacity of biathletes.Copyright © 2019 Miłosz Czuba et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660818>Curcumin prevents brain damage and cognitive dysfunction during ischemic-reperfusion through the regulation of miR-7-5p.</a></h2><p>This study was to investigate the potential protective effects of curcumin in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (CIR) and its regulation of miR-7.Rats were occluded by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 1. h and reperfused for 2 h to establish a local CIR model. After 24 hours of model establishment, MCAO rats were given curcumin for 3 days by intragastric administration. PC12 cells were cultured for 6 h in -glucose deprivation medium and then reoxygenated for 24 h to establish an -glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model. The OGD/R model cells were treated with curcumin for 48 h.Curcumin inhibited the decrease of miR-7-5p expression and increase of RelA p65 expression induced by CIR and ODG/R. RelA p65 was a target of miR-7-5p. MiR-7-5p antagonists were able to counteract the effect of curcumin on the expression of RelA p65 in ischemic brain tissue of MCAO rats and OGD/R model cells. Curcumin improved OGD/R-induced inhibition of cell activity, necrosis and apoptosis. Curcumin significantly reduced the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, reactive  species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased the activity of superoxide dismutases (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in OGD/R-induced cells. Curcumin may inhibit OGD/R-induced cell damage by regulating miR-7-5p. Curcumin improved cerebral infarction, nerve damage and cognitive dysfunction in rats with CIR, which may be related to the regulation of miR-7-5p/RelA p65 axis.Curcumin exerts cerebral protection by attenuating cell necrosis and apoptosis, inflammatory response and oxidative stress following CIR, which may be related to its regulation of the miR-7/RELA p65 axis.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636243>Effects of Adding Dexmedetomidine to Local Infiltration of Bupivacaine on Postoperative Pain in Pediatric Herniorrhaphy; A Randomized Clinical Trial.</a></h2><p>We aimed to compare addition of dexmedetomidine to local infiltration of bupivacaine to promote the post-operative pain relief in children undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy.This double-blind randomized clinical trial included 60 children aged 6-72 months undergoing unilateral herniorrhaphy at selected hospitals, Shiraz, Iran, who were randomly allocated into two groups.

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), BBB breakdown has been shown to occur even before cognitive decline and brain pathology. To investigate the role of the cerebral vasculature in AD, a physiologically relevant 3D human neural cell culture microfluidic model is developed having a brain endothelial cell monolayer with a BBB-like phenotype. This model is shown to recapitulate several key aspects of BBB dysfunction observed in AD patients: increased BBB permeability, decreased expression of claudin-1, claudin-, and VE-cadherin, increased expression of matrix-metalloproteinase-2 and reactive  species, and deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides at the vascular endothelium. Thus, it provides a well-controlled platform for investigating BBB function as well as for screening of new drugs that need to pass the BBB to gain access to neural tissues.© 2019 The Authors.

Dissipation accelerated as pH increased with half-lives ranging from 26.9 to 2.2 days with slight inhibition in rice field water. The addition of divalent metals was not observed to catalyze the hydrolysis of CAP at pH 6, indicating that the insecticide is likely to remain recalcitrant to hydrolysis in neutral or acidic surface waters. However, Mn and Ni were observed to inhibit hydrolysis at pH 8 and 9. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared analysis supports the conclusion that divalent metals may withdraw electron density from the amide nitrogen via interaction with the amide , though additional quantum chemical modeling is necessary to provide further mechanistic insights. Overall, the hydrolysis of CAP in California rice fields and their surrounding surface waters will be dominated by pH and inhibited by dissolved metal species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661680>Cardio-respiratory signal extraction from video camera data for continuous non-contact vital sign monitoring using deep learning.</a></h2><p>Non-contact vital sign monitoring enables the estimation of vital signs, such as heart rate, respiratory rate and  saturation (SpO2), by measuring subtle color changes on the skin surface using a video camera. For patients in a hospital ward, the main challenges in the development of continuous and robust non-contact monitoring techniques are the identification of time periods and the segmentation of skin regions of interest (ROIs) from which vital signs can be estimated. This paper presents two convolutional neural network (CNN) models. The first network was designed for detecting the presence of a patient and segmenting the patient's skin area. The second network combined the output from the first network with optical flow for identifying time periods of clinical intervention so that these periods can be excluded from the estimation of vital signs. Both networks were trained using video recordings from a clinical study involving 15 pre-term infants conducted in the high dependency area of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, UK. The proposed methods achieved an accuracy of 98.8\% for patient detection, a mean intersection-over-union (IOU) score of 88.6\% for skin segmentation and an accuracy of 94.\% for clinical intervention detection using two-fold cross validation. Our deep learning models produced accurate results and were robust to different skin tones, changes in light conditions, pose variations and different clinical interventions by medical staff and family visitors. Finally, we show that cardio-respiratory signals can be continuously derived from the patient's skin during which the patient is present and no clinical intervention is undertaken.Creative Commons Attribution license.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648560>A novel doubly labelled C, N amino acid method for measuring energy and protein metabolism in man.</a></h2><p>A novel doubly [1-C, α-NH]-labelled amino acid method (DLAAM) is presented for the determination of the CO production (RCO) and energy expenditure in humans. This method is based on the simultaneous administration of [1-C]glycine and [N]glycine followed by the measurement of excretion kinetics of breath CO and urinary N. The basic idea of the DLAAM is that the unknown C recovery RF(C) of the 1-C amino acid, essential for the calculation of the net CO production, can be approximated by the easily measureable N recovery RF(N) of the α-NH labelled amino acid. In four healthy adult men (76-97 kg) the DLAAM was tested parallel to the IC and in one man (74 kg) parallel to the DLWM. Using the approximation RF(C) ≈ RF(N) the RCO (in l CO d) was calculated to 387.0 ± 30.3 (DLAAM) vs. 382.8 ± 22.6. (IC). The Bland-Altman plot shows that the difference between the DLAAM and IC of individual RCO is within the 95 % confidence interval (mean ± 2 SD): +4.3 ± 37. l CO d. We conclude that the DLAAM and IC may be used interchangeably. The physical activity level (PAL) was calculated based on the DLAAM vs. DLWM to about 1..

Indeed, improvements in modelling gas-liquid mass transfer can bring huge benefits in terms of reaction rates, plant energy expenditure, acid-base equilibria and greenhouse gas emissions. Despite these efforts, there is still no universally valid correlation between the design and operating parameters of a wastewater treatment plant and the gas-liquid mass transfer coefficients. That is why the current practice for  mass transfer modelling is to apply overly simplified models, which come with multiple assumptions that are not valid for most applications. To deal with these complexities, correction factors were introduced over time. The most uncertain of them is the α-factor. To build fundamental gas-liquid mass transfer knowledge more advanced modelling paradigms have been applied more recently. Yet these come with a high level of complexity making them impractical for rapid process design and optimisation in an industrial setting. However, the knowledge gained from these more advanced models can help in improving the way the α-factor and thus gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient should be applied. That is why the presented work aims at clarifying the current state-of-the-art in gas-liquid mass transfer modelling of  and other gases, but also to direct academic research efforts towards the needs of the industrial practitioners.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650500>Evaluation of hyperoxia-induced hypercapnia in obese patients after cardiac surgery: a randomized crossover comparison of conservative and liberal  administration.</a></h2><p>Recent studies on patients with stable obesity-hypoventilation syndrome have raised concerns about hyperoxia-induced hypercapnia in this population. This study aimed to evaluate whether a higher  saturation target would increase arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO in obese patients after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG).Obese patients having CABG were recruited. With a randomized crossover design, we compared two oxygenation strategies for 30 min each, immediately after extubation: a peripheral  saturation (SpO) target of ≥ 95% achieved with manual  titration (liberal) and a SpO target of 90% achieved with FreeO, an automated  titration device (conservative). The main outcome was end-of-period arterial PaCO.Thirty patients were included. Mean (standard deviation [SD]) body mass index (BMI) was 34 (3) kg·m and mean (SD) baseline partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO) was 40.7 (3.1) mmHg. Mean (SD) end-of-period PaCO was 42.0 (.4) mmHg in the conservative period, compared with 42.6 (4.6) mmHg in the liberal period [mean difference - 0.6 (95% confidence interval - 2.2 to 0.9) mmHg; P = 0.4]. Adjusted analysis for age, BMI, narcotics, and preoperative PaCO did not substantively change the results. Fourteen patients were retainers, showing an elevation in mean (SD) PaCO in the liberal period of 3.3 (4.1) mmHg. Eleven patients had the opposite response, with a mean (SD) end-of-period PaCO decrease of 1.8 (2.2) mmHg in the liberal period. Five patients had a neutral response.This study did not show a clinically important increase in PaCO associated with higher SpO values in this specific population of obese patients after CABG. Partial pressure of carbon dioxide increased with liberal  administration in almost half of the patients, but no predictive factor was identified.www.clinicaltrials.gov (); registered 25 September, 2016.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642660>Enhancing  Vacancies by Introducing Na+ into OMS-2 Tunnels to Promote Catalytic Ozone Decomposition.</a></h2><p>A series of Na-OMS-2 catalysts was prepared by a facile solid-state reaction method. Their physiochemical properties were characterized and catalytic activity for ozone decomposition evaluated. The results showed that Na+ introduction in the tunnel framework of OMS-2 facilitated lattice defect formation, which significantly enhanced  vacancies, which are believed to be the active sites for ozone decomposition. Density functional theory calculations also showed that both the  vacancy formation energy and ozone adsorption energy over Na-OMS-2 decreased because of Na+ introduction. Sodium ion introduction significantly improved OMS-2 catalytic activity for ozone decomposition. The Na-OMS-2 catalyst with a Na/Mn molar ratio of 1/4 exhibited ozone conversion at 92.% at 25 ± 1 °C after reaction for 6 h under an initial ozone concentration of 45 ± 2 ppm, relative humidity of 30 ± 2%, and space velocity of 660,000 h-1. This showed that this catalyst was far superior to manganese oxide catalysts reported to date. Furthermore, the research results also showed that the catalytic activity of the Na-OMS-2 deactivated by the accumulation of -related intermediates was recovered by calcination at 425 °C under a N2 atmosphere for 0. h. Finally, a complete mechanism for ozone decomposition, deactivation and regeneration was proposed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654994>The influence of the technique of surfactant administration (LISA vs INSURE) on the outcomes of respiratory distress syndrome treatment in preterm infants.</a></h2><p>Intratracheal administration of exogenous surfactant is a well-established therapy for respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants. The two preferred methods for respiratory support in neonates that contribute to limiting the risk of lung damage associated with mechanical ventilation include nCPAP and non-invasive ventilation. The increasing popularity of surfactant administration techniques is due to the fact they reduce the time of mechanical ventilation until this medication is administered. In some cases a short period of mechanical ventilation follows (INSURE: INtubation-SURfactant-Extubation). There are also methods that make it possible to completely avoid intubation and help maintain spontaneous breathing during surfactant administration (LISA: Less Invasive Surfactant Administration, MIST: Minimal Invasive Surfactant Therapy). Aim: To analyze treatment outcomes in preterm infants who suffer from respiratory distress syndrome and require exogenous surfactant administration depending on the technique used: LISA vs INSURE.Material and methods: The present retrospective analysis included 129 infants born at a gestational age of between 24 and 33 weeks who were hospitalized in the Neonatology Department in the years 2014-2016, were administered surfactant and remained on non-invasive ventilation. All the subjects received only proractant alfa. Both study groups: LISA (n=83) and INSURE (n=46) were analyzed in terms of respiratory distress treatment outcomes and the presence of complications of prematurity.Results: There were no significant differences in patient characteristics between the two study groups (LISA vs INSURE: mean birth body weight was 1210 g vs 1275 g, respectively; mean gestational age at birth was 30 weeks vs 29 6/7 weeks, respectively). The comparison of respiratory support method and FiO2 concentration within the first 72 hours after surfactant administration showed no significant differences between the groups. Similarly, respiratory outcomes did not significantly differ between the LISA and INSURE groups and were: the need for intubation ⎼ 42.2% vs 32.6%, p=0.201, duration of mechanical ventilation - median days 0 vs 0, p=0.377, duration of nCPAP - median days  vs , p=0.379, duration of  supplementation - median days 1 vs 1, p=0.555, and the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia - 28.9% vs 23.9%, p=0.506. Also, the incidence of complications was similar in both study groups.Conclusions: Our retrospective analysis of preliminary outcomes of surfactant administration involving the use of the LISA technique showed no statistically significant differences as compared with the INSURE method. The randomized, prospective study that is currently being conducted at our Neonatology Department and includes biochemical markers of lung damage, will bring more objective data on the safety and effectiveness of both surfactant administration techniques (LISA vs INSURE).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672370>Effects of phosphorus availability and phosphorus utilization behavior of Microcystis aeruginosa on its adaptation capability to ultraviolet radiation.</a></h2><p>Phosphorus (P) plays a critical role in eutrophication and algal growth; therefore, improving our understanding of the impact of P is essential to control harmful algal blooms. In this study, Microcystis aeruginosa was treated with -h ambient irradiation in the medium with different dissolved inorganic P (DIP) concentrations, DIP-free, moderate-DIP, and high-DIP, to explore its growth and other physiological responses. Compared to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), UV-A (320-400 nm) and UV-B (280-320 nm) radiation had inhibitive effects on the photosynthesis and growth of M. aeruginosa, while high P availability could alleviate or eliminate the negative effects of UV radiation. The photosynthetic parameters had a minimum reduction and quickly recovered after re-inoculation under high-DIP conditions. Confirmed by SEM, photosynthetic pigments, the generation of reactive  species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and other methods, ambient UV radiation exerted oxidative stresses rather than direct lethal effects on M. aeruginosa. Photosynthetic parameters indicated that algal UV-adaptation processes could include decreasing photo-induced damages and increasing self-repair efficiency. The P acquired by M. aeruginosa cells can have two function, which included alleviating UV-induced negative effects and sustaining algal growth. Consequently, UV-adaptation processes of M. aeruginosa resulted in an elevated demand for DIP, which resulted to increased P uptake rates and cellular P quota under moderate and high-DIP conditions. Therefore, the production of carotenoid and phycocyanin, and SOD activity increased under UV stress, leading to a better adaptation capability of M. aeruginosa and decreased negative effects of UV radiation on its growth. Overall, our findings demonstrated the significant interactive effects of P enrichment and irradiation on typical cyanobacteria, and the strong adaptation capability of M. aeruginosa in the eutrophic UV-radiated waters.Copyright © 2019.

ROS is increased by activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase family members and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis of mitochondria. Increased ROS is detoxified by superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxiredoxins. ROS has a role as a secondary messenger in signal transduction. Cancer cells induce fluctuations of redox homeostasis by variation of ROS regulated machinery, leading to increased tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. Redox-mediated mechanisms of chemoresistance include endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated autophagy, increased cell cycle progression, and increased conversion to metastasis or cancer stem-like cells. This review discusses changes of the redox state in tumorigenesis and redox-mediated mechanisms involved in tolerance to chemotherapeutic drugs in cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644601>Constitutive expression of an A- subgroup member in the DREB transcription factor subfamily from Ammopiptanthus mongolicus enhanced abiotic stress tolerance and anthocyanin accumulation in transgenic Arabidopsis.</a></h2><p>Dehydration-responsive element-binding (DREB) transcription factors (TFs) are key regulators of stress-inducible gene expression in plants. Anthocyanins, an important class of flavonoids, protect plants from reactive  species produced under abiotic stresses. However, regulation of DREBs on anthocyanin accumulation is largely unknown. Here, an A- subgroup DREB gene (AmDREB3) isolated from Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, a desert broadleaf shrub with very high tolerance to harsh environments, was characterized in terms of both abiotic stress tolerance and anthocyanin accumulation. AmDREB3 does not contain the transcriptional repression motif EAR, and the protein was located in the nucleus and has transcriptional activation capacity. The transcription of AmDREB3 was differentially induced in the shoots and roots of A. mongolicus seedlings under drought, salt, heat, cold, ultraviolet B, and abscisic acid treatments. Moreover, the transcript levels in twigs, young leaves, and roots were higher than in other organs of A. mongolicus shrubs. Constitutively expressing AmDREB3 improved the tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis to drought, high salinity and heat, likely by inducing the expression of certain stress-inducible genes. The transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings also exhibited an obvious purple coloration and significant increases in anthocyanin accumulation and/or oxidative stress tolerance under drought, salt, and heat stresses. These results suggest that the AmDREB3 TF may be an important positive regulator of both stress tolerance and anthocyanin accumulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647678>Potential-Dependent Volcano Plot for  Reduction: Mathematical Origin and Implications for Catalyst Design.</a></h2><p>Climbing up the volcano peak stands as a challenging problem for  reduction. Repeated efforts have been made to fine-tune the binding energy of  reaction intermediates within a narrow region of 0.2 eV by adjusting the catalyst electronic structure. Herein, we address ourselves to two different, oft-neglected but nontrivial questions: (a) Does a superior  reduction reaction catalyst in rotating disk electrode experiments still work well in practical fuel cells (usually at a different potential)? (b) For a given catalyst, can we place it on the volcano peak by adjusting the electrode potential (ϕ), which can be easily varied within 0. V in experiments, and the potential at the reaction plane in solution (ϕ), which is modulated by double-layer electrostatic effects? To answer these two questions, we articulate the mathematical origin of the volcano plot and reveal its dependence on ϕ and ϕ by combining a microkinetic model for the  reduction reaction and a mean-field model for the double layer. Furthermore, we explore possible approaches of adjusting ϕ, for instance, by varying electrolyte concentration and particularly by tuning the electrostatic properties of the support material in a supported catalyst system. The investigation of how electrostatic properties of the support material affect the volcano plot of a supported catalyst opens an additional channel of catalyst-support interactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648576>Metabolic heat coherent growth of  (HV) for enhanced production of Extracellular Polymeric Substances (EPS) in a Bio Reaction Calorimeter (BioRC).</a></h2><p>The optimum condition at which the halophilic salt-tolerant bacterium  (MTCC 3712) produces the maximum amount of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) was investigated experimentally using response surface methodology based on the central composite design (CCD).

They affect the pathophysiology and treatment of conditions like hemorrhagic shock (HS) but direct noninvasive measures of flow, PO and their heterogeneity during prolonged HS are infrequently presented. To fill this void, we report the first quantitative evaluation of flow-PO relationships and heterogeneities in normovolemia and during several hours of HS using noninvasive unbiased automated acquisition. Anesthetized rats were subjected to tracheostomy, arterial/venous catheterizations, cremaster muscle exteriorization, hemorrhage (40% total blood volume) and laparotomy. Control animals equally instrumented were not subjected to hemorrhage/laparotomy. Every 0. h during 4. hours, noninvasive laser speckle contrast imaging and phosphorescence quenching were employed for nearly 7000 flow/PO measurements in muscles from 8 animals using an automated system. Precise alignment of 16 muscle areas allowed overlapping between flow and oxygenation measurements to evaluate spatial heterogeneity and repeated measurements were used to estimate temporal heterogeneity. Systemic physiological parameters and blood chemistry were simultaneously assessed by blood samplings replaced with crystalloids. Hemodilution was associated with local hypoxia but increased flow prevented major  delivery decline. Adding laparotomy and prolonged HS resulted in hypoxia, ischemia, decreased tissue  delivery and logarithmic flow/PO relationships in most regions. Flow and PO spatial heterogeneities were higher than their respective temporal heterogeneities although did not change significantly over the studied period. This quantitative framework establishes a basis for evaluating therapies aimed at restoring muscle homeostasis, positively impacting outcomes of civilian and military trauma/HS victims.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670228>Hydrothermal carbonization of different wetland biomass wastes: Phosphorus reclamation and hydrochar production.</a></h2><p>Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) has drawn increasing interest for the disposal of solid wastes with a high moisture content, while minimal attention has been paid to HTC treatment of wetland plants and the corresponding phosphorus (P) transformation. In order to evaluate its feasibility for wetland plants treatment, hydrochars from different wetland plants were produced at different temperatures (200 °C, 220 °C, 240 °C, and 260 °C) and characterized, and the transformation of P was investigated. In comparison with wetland plant derived biochars, the derived hydrochars had a moderate pH (.0-7.7), more -containing groups, and higher energy density (18.0-27.1 MJ kg). These properties were affected by hydrothermal temperature and feedstock choice. In contrast to high water-soluble P in biomass (71.0-73.2% of total P), more recalcitrant P species formed in hydrochars, implying that HTC treatment could achieve P immobilization and reduce P leaching loss. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) results indicated that monoester-P and soluble orthophosphate were transformed to insoluble orthophosphate during the HTC treatment. Therefore, HTC is a promising treatment technique for wetland plants to produce valuable char with P reclamation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Neonates receiving continuous infusion of dobutamine -20 μg kg min were included. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and cardiac output of right and left ventricle (RVO, LVO) were measured on echocardiography; heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), peripheral arterial  saturation and cerebral regional  saturation were recorded from patient monitors.28 neonates with median (range) gestational age of 30.4 (22.7 - 41.0) weeks and birth weight (BW) of 1618 (465 - 4380) g were included.

All patients were treated with HFNC or conventional  therapy (COT), such as a nasal cannula or venturi mask, immediately after extubation. Decongestive therapy (intravenous furosemide infusion) was administered at the discretion of the attending physician.Of 212 patients treated during the study period, 47 were excluded due to recent open-heart surgery and two, due to insufficient clinical data. The remaining 163 patients had a mean age of 67.4±14.3 years, and 92 (56.4%) were male; 44 patients received HFNC, and 119 COT. Mean weight loss within 72 hours of extubation was -0.86±2.03 kg.

Self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) implantation via bronchoscopy can immediately relieve airway stenosis and improve survival. The purpose of this study was to determine the factors that predict survival in patients with airway involvement due to advanced esophageal cancer after SEMS implantation.We conducted this retrospective study from February 2007 to October 2013 at a university hospital. Forty-two patients with advanced esophageal cancer and airway involvement were included. The patients underwent flexible bronchoscopy with electrosurgery and SEMS implantation under bronchoscopic visualization and local anesthesia with no fluoroscopic guidance throughout the procedure.Acute respiratory failure (ARF) occurred in 14 patients (33.3%). After SEMS implantation, 28 patients (66.7%) received additional anti-cancer therapy. The median survival after the procedure was 83 days. A longer survival was seen in the patients who received further anti-cancer therapy [hazard ratio (HR), 0.146; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.06-0.34; P<0.001].

Laboratory based studies investigating the mechanisms of thermoregulation in marine ectotherms, however, rarely consider key temporal elements of thermal exposure, such as the rate at which temperature changes. We tested the hypothesis that juvenile seahorses, Hippocampus erectus, from a tropical coastal lagoon in Yucatan, Mexico, would exhibit variations in physiological and behavioural descriptors of thermoregulation when submitted to contrasting regimes during 30 days: temperature constant at 25 °C (C 25); gradually increasing 1 °C every  days from 25 to 30 °C (GI 25-30); and constant at 30 °C (C 30). Immediately after exposure, critical maximum temperature, thermal preference,  consumption, partial energy balance, growth rate and survival of seahorses were measured. Seahorses exposed to GI 25-30 showed a significantly higher critical thermal maxima (37.8 ± 0.9 °C), preference (28.7 ± 0.4 °C), growth (1.10 ± 0.49%) and survival (97.6%) than those exposed to C 30 (36. ± 1, 29.4 ± 0.3 °C, 0.48 ± 0.32%, 73.8%, respectively). Both high temperature regimes induced metabolic depression, but ramping resulted in a greater amount of energy assimilated (278.9 ± 175.4 J g day) and higher energy efficiency for growth (89.8%) than constant exposure to 30 °C (115.4 ± 63.4 J g day, 65.3%, respectively). Gradually increasing temperature allowed physiological mechanisms of thermal adjustment to take place, reflecting the capacity of juvenile H. erectus to respond to environmental change. Despite its advantage, this capacity is limited in time, since the cumulative effect of thermal exposure affected metabolic performance, eventually compromising survival. The study of seahorse response to thermal variations in the context of ocean warming needs to consider the temporal elements of thermal exposure to foresee its vulnerability under future scenarios.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, hetero-layered nanostructures of Ni-Fe hydroxide/oxide with a high activity for an  evolution reaction (OER) were synthesized on a 316 stainless steel (SS) substrate through constant current density electrolysis. The thicknesses, morphologies, and compositions of the nanostructures, generated through dealloying and surface oxidation of the SS elements with severe  micro-bubble evolution, were dependent on the electrolysis time. Nano-structural analyses showed that Ni-Fe hydroxide/oxide hetero-layered nanostructures were generated during the initial stage of electrolysis, growing nanofiber-like Ni-Fe hydroxide layers with increasing electrolysis time up to  h. The prolonged electrolysis resulted in densification of the nanofiber structures. The OER overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 was estimated to be 254 mV at 20 °C, demonstrating better performance than that of a standard OER catalyst, e.g., Ir oxide, and obtaining the value of Ni-Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH). Furthermore, the OER property surpassed the Ni-Fe LDH catalysts at high current density regions greater than 100 mA/cm2. Moreover, stable electrolysis was achieved for 20 h at conditions similar to that of the practical AWE of 400 mA/cm2 in 20 and 75 ℃ solution. Therefore, the simple surface modification method could synthesize highly active nanostructures for alkaline water splitting anodes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666411>[The fenofibrate effect on genotoxicity in brain and liver and on the expression of genes regulating fatty acids metabolism of mice].</a></h2><p>Fibrates are well-known agonists of the PPAR family (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors). This class of drugs is used for the treatment of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Fenofibrate is one of the members of this class of synthetic PPARα receptor ligands. The oral administration of 0.3% fenofibrate caused a decrease in strength due to loss of body weight in laboratory animals when improving behavioural features. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of liver cells showed a genotoxic effect of fenofibrate, due to accumulation of reactive  species, which could be attributed to activation of peroxisomal β-oxidation processes, as well as to the lack of increase in the expression of genes encoding antioxidant defense proteins. Treatment with fenofibrate did not cause brain mtDNA damage. It has been shown that fenofibrate induced mitochondrial β-oxidation in the brain, as indicated by the increased expression of the Acadm and Cpt1a and Ppargc1a and Ppara. The study found no effect of fenofibrate on the increase of mitochondrial biogenesis in brain and liver cells. Thus, we can conclude that fenofibrate significantly affects lipid metabolism in the liver and brain, but in the liver it is associated with an increase of oxidative stress, resulting in mtDNA oxidative damage. However, fenofibrate-induced increase in the expression of Ppargc1a is not associated with an increase of mitochondrial biogenesis. This is consistent with the recent suggestion that PGC-1α might not be a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643134>Manganese-doped green tea-derived carbon quantum dots as a targeted dual imaging and photodynamic therapy platform.</a></h2><p>In this work, manganese-doped carbon quantum dots (Mn-CQDs) have been synthesized through a one-pot hydrothermal method by using waste green tea. The Mn dopants were introduced to impart magnetic resonance capability. Upon optimization of the experimental conditions, magnetofluorescent Mn-CQDs exhibit an excitation-dependent blue emission. The abundant functional groups on Mn-CQDs not only promote water solubility but also allow straightforward functionalization with amine groups. The amine-terminated Mn-CQDs were then subsequently conjugated to folic acid (FA) and chlorin e6 (Ce6) to obtain the Mn-CQDs@FA/Ce6 magnetofluorescent photodynamic therapy (PDT) agent. in vitro studies using three different cells indicated specific targeting of Mn-CQDs@FA/Ce6 to the overexpressing folate receptor human epithelial carcinoma cell line (HeLa) cancer cells. Furthermore, Mn-CQDs@FA/Ce6 enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal with an r /r ratio of .77. Favorably, by using the Mn-CQDs@FA delivery system, active Ce6 can reach the cellular interior while its red fluorescence (FL) and reactive  species generation can be retained, as has been verified by confocal microscopy. in vitro cell viability studies verified the biocompatibility of Mn-CQDs@FA/Ce6 nanohybrid with no significant toxicity up to 500 ppm while PDT treatment with  min irradiation (671 nm, 1 W cm ) was effective in killing >90% of cells. The light-triggered Mn-CQDs@FA/Ce6 multifunctional hybrid can serve as a dual-modal FL/MRI probe and as an efficient PDT agent to detect and eradicate cancer cells remotely.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654851>Template-free Synthesis of Stable Cobalt Manganese Spinel Hollow Nanostructured Catalysts for Highly Water-Resistant CO Oxidation.</a></h2><p>Development of spinel oxides as low-cost and high-efficiency catalysts is highly desirable; however, rational synthesis of efficient and stable spinel systems with precisely controlled structure and components remains challenging. We demonstrate the design of complex nanostructured cobalt-based bimetallic spinel catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation by a simple template-free method. The self-assembled multi-shelled mesoporous spinel nanostructures provide high surface area (203. m/g) and favorable unique surface chemistry for producing abundant active sites and lead to the creation of robust microsphere configured by 16-nm spinel nanosheets, which achieve satisfactory water-resisting property and catalytic activity. Theoretical models show that O vacancies at exposed {110} facets in cubic spinel phase guarantee the strong adsorption of reactive  species on the surface of catalysts and play a key role in the prevention of deactivation under moisture-rich conditions.

Throat swab specimens of the patients were determined for nucleic acid detection of influenza A (H1N1) virus, and all of the patients were confirmed. The gender, age, course of disease, underlying diseases, symptoms, body temperature, hospital stays, chest CT findings and laboratory results were collected, and the treatments and prognosis were recorded.Of 54 patients, 38 patients were enrolled in severe group, and 16 in critical group. Fever, cough, sputum, shortness of breath and so on could be found in the two groups. The CD4T lymphocytes were less than normal reference value (410-1 590/μL) in both groups.

Artemisinin has been reported to sensitize cervical cancer cells to radiotherapy. In the present study, we determined whether ART and ARM could enhance the cytotoxicity of -aminolevulinic acid (-ALA)-based photodynamic therapy (PDT) against the mammary tumor cells of mice. The corrected PpIX fluorescence intensities in the control, -ALA, -ALA + ART, and -ALA + ARM groups were 3.385 ± 3.730, 165.7 ± 33.45, 139.0 ± 52.77, and 165.4 ± 51.10 a.u., respectively. At light doses of 3 and  J/cm, the viability of -ALA-PDT-treated cells significantly decreased with ART ( < 0.01 and  < 0.01) and ARM treatment ( < 0.01 and  < 0.01). Besides, the number of annexin V-FITC and ethidium homodimer III-positive cells was greater in the -ALA-PDT with ARM group than that in the other groups. -acetylcysteine could not significantly inhibit the percentages of apoptotic cells or inviable cells induced by -ALA-PDT with ARM. These reactive  species-independent mechanisms might enhance cytotoxicity in -ALA-PDT with ARM-treated tumor cells, suggesting that the use of -ALA-PDT with ARM could be a new strategy to enhance PDT cytotoxicity against tumor cells.

Yet, hybrid Density Functional Theory/Molecular Mechanical (DFT/MM) calculations of oxy-Mb models predict that the O bond is much less resistant to breaking in the presence of hydrogen sulfide (HS) compared with water. Specifically, a hydrogen atom from HS can be transferred to the distal  atom through homolytic cleavage of the S-H bond to form the intermediate Compound (Cpd) 0 structure and a thiyl radical. In the presence of a neutral His64 (Nε protonation, His64-ε) and HS, only a metastable Cpd 0 would be formed as the active site is devoid of any additional proton donor to fully break the O bond. In contrast, the calculations predict that the triplet state is significantly favored over the open shell singlet diradical state throughout the entire reaction coordinate in the presence of HS and a positively charged His64. Furthermore, a positively charged His64 can readily donate a proton to Cpd 0 to fully break the O bond resulting in a configuration analogous to reported reaction models of a hemoglobin mutant bound to HO with HS present. Typically, exotic techniques are required to generate Cpd 0 but under the conditions just described the intermediate is readily detected in UV-Vis spectra at room temperature. The effect is observed as a 2 nm red shift of the Soret band from 414 nm to 416 nm (pH .0, His64-εδ) and from 416 nm to 418 nm (pH 6.6, His64-ε).Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Oxidative stress attenuates melanoma metastasis, and melanoma cells must reduce oxidative stress to metastasize. We explored this in sarcomas by screening for oxidative stress sensitizers, which identified the class I HDAC inhibitor MS-275 as enhancing vulnerability to reactive  species (ROS) in sarcoma cells. Mechanistically, MS-275 inhibits YB-1 deacetylation, decreasing its binding to '-UTRs of NFE2L2 encoding the antioxidant factor NRF2, thereby reducing NFE2L2 translation and synthesis of NRF2 to increase cellular ROS. By global acetylomics, MS-275 promotes rapid acetylation of the YB-1 RNA-binding protein at lysine-81, blocking binding and translational activation of NFE2L2, as well as known YB-1 mRNA targets, HIF1A, and the stress granule nucleator, G3BP1. MS-275 dramatically reduces sarcoma metastasis in vivo, but an MS-275-resistant YB-1K81-to-alanine mutant restores metastatic capacity and NRF2, HIF1α, and G3BP1 synthesis in MS-275-treated mice. These studies describe a novel function for MS-275 through enhanced YB-1 acetylation, thus inhibiting YB-1 translational control of key cytoprotective factors and its pro-metastatic activity.© 2019 The Authors.

In this study, wheat bran protein isolate was digested with alcalase to produce wheat bran protein hydrolysate (WPH) that was then separated into different peptide fractions (<1, 1-3, 3-, and -10 kDa) by membrane ultrafiltration. WPH and the peptide fractions were evaluated for in vitro activities such as antioxidant, renin inhibition, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. In addition, the blood pressure-lowering effects of WPH and the <1 kDa peptides were determined by oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Results showed that the ACE and renin inhibitions were significantly (p < .05) higher for the <1 kDa fraction (84.25% ± 2.45%, 75.19% ± 1.75%, respectively) when compared to the WPH and >1 kDa fractions. The <1 kDa fraction also showed significantly (p < .05) higher  radical antioxidant activity with 2044.73 ± 37.45 (μM TE/g protein) when compared to lower values obtained for the >1 kDa membrane fractions and WPH. Oral administration (100 mg/kg body weight) of the <1 kDa membrane fraction to SHRs resulted in a better decrease (-35 mmHg) in the systolic blood pressure when compared to the WPH (-20 mmHg) after 6 hr. And seven peptides (NL, QL, FL, HAL, AAVL, AKTVF, and TPLTR) were identified and amino acid sequence was determined by tandem mass spectrometry. We conclude that the WPH could be considered as a suitable natural antihypertensive and antioxidant resource. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The results of the present study indicate that WPH and its ultrafiltration fractions possess potential as a source of antihypertensive and strong antioxidant peptides. It has been proved that wheat bran has a good blood pressure lowering and antioxidation and other biological activities, and the <1 kDa fraction showing high  radical absorbance capacity level also has better in vitro ACE inhibition and renin-inhibitory activity. The higher antihypertensive efficiency of the <1 kDa fraction may be because the peptides can be better absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract or an increased ability to interact with the enzyme (ACE or renin) protein structure to change the active conformation and lead to decreased catalysis. The results of this study indicate that WPH, especially <1 kDa peptide, can be used as a component in formulating antihypertensive functional foods and nutraceuticals, thus improving the industrial production efficiency and bioavailability of wheat bran.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654926>An improved model for the kinetics of non-oxidative hydrothermal process.</a></h2><p>Hydrothermal processing as a post-treatment technology for sludge has attracted great interest globally as it could reduce the amount of sludge considerably. This experimental study developed a comprehensive kinetic model of cellulose degradation via non-oxidative hydrothermal processing at various temperatures (ranges 180-260 °C). Values of activation energies and pre-exponential factors were determined using chemical  demand (COD)-based lumped concentrations. In this study, a new reaction pathway between solid, soluble matter and gaseous products was proposed which not only enables prediction of solid phase degradation but also can predict the formation of various types of products (in liquid and gas phase) during the reaction time. The results show that the reaction rate of cellulose to liquid products (k=2.7×10exp(-102810RT)) were fast compared to that of for liquid products to gaseous products (k=4.4×10exp(-64629RT)). Moreover, the model infers that the major part of solid degradation leads to the formation of the gaseous product with the reaction rate constant of k=.7exp(-12905RT). The proposed model can provide an opportunity to predict the performance of the non-oxidative hydrothermal processing of organic solid waste.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In advanced age, cerebromicrovascular oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction impair neurovascular coupling, contributing to age-related cognitive decline. Recently we developed a resveratrol (3,4',-trihydroxystilbene)-containing fusogenic liposome (FL-RSV)-based molecular delivery system that can effectively target cultured cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells, attenuating age-related oxidative stress. To assess the cerebromicrovascular protective effects of FL-RSV in vivo, aged (24-month-old) C57BL/6 mice were treated with FL-RSV for four days. To demonstrate effective cellular uptake of FL-RSV, accumulation of the lipophilic tracer dyes in cells of the neurovascular unit was confirmed using two-photon imaging (through a chronic cranial window). NVC was assessed by measuring CBF responses (laser speckle contrast imaging) evoked by contralateral whisker stimulation. We found that NVC responses were significantly impaired in aged mice. Treatment with FL-RSV significantly improved NVC responses by increasing NO-mediated vasodilation. These findings are paralleled by the protective effects of FL-RSV on endothelium-dependent relaxation in the aorta. Thus, treatment with FL-RSV rescues endothelial function and NVC responses in aged mice. We propose that resveratrol containing fusogenic liposomes could also be used for combined delivery of various anti-geronic factors, including proteins, small molecules, DNA vectors and mRNAs targeting key pathways involved in microvascular aging and neurovascular dysfunction for the prevention/treatment of age-related cerebromicrovascular pathologies and development of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) in aging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670339>New VO-complexes for oxidative desulfurization of refractory sulfur compounds in fuel: synthesis, structure, reactivity trend and mechanistic studies.</a></h2><p>A series of -coordinate oxidovanadium(iv) complexes based on 2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)imidazole (HPIMH), with substituent groups of different electronegativities on the phenolic para position (HPIMX; X = -H, -Br, -OMe and -NO2), were synthesized and characterized. Three of these complexes were characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, [VIVO(PIMH)2], [VIVO(PIMBr)2] and [VIVO(PIMNO2)2], as well as a dioxidovanadium(v) compound ([VVO2(PIMH)(PIMH2)]). The complexes were tested for their catalytic activities in the oxidation of dibenzothiophene (DBT), the major refractory organosulfur compound found in fuel. The nitro substituted compound [VIVO(PIMNO2)2] had the highest catalytic oxidation activity followed by: [VIVO(PIMH)2] > [VIVO(PIMBr)2] > [VIVO(PIMMeO)2]. The decrease in activity is attributed to the different electronegativities of the substituent groups, which influence the electron density on the metal center, the V[double bond, length as m-dash]O bond distances and infrared stretching bands. Geometry index (τ) values calculated from single crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) data and DFT studies provided further insights on the trend in activity observed. SC-XRD, EPR, 51V NMR and UV-Vis spectroscopies, and DFT studies were instrumental in studying the mechanism of the catalyzed reaction and proposal of intermediate species. Both radical and non-radical pathways are plausible for the catalytic oxidation and participation of reactive  species in both pathways is also postulated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657553>Iron oxide nanoparticle-induced neoplastic-like cell transformation in vitro is reduced with protective amorphous silica coating.</a></h2><p>Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP) have recently surged in production and use in a wide variety of biomedical and environmental applications. However, their potential long term health effects, including carcinogenesis, are unknown. Limited research suggests IONP can induce genotoxicity and neoplastic transformation associated with particle dissolution and release of free iron ions. "Safe by design" strategies involve the modification of particle physicochemical properties to affect subsequent adverse outcomes, such as an amorphous silica coating to reduce IONP dissolution and direct interaction with cells. We hypothesized that long-term exposure to a specific IONP (nFe2O3) would induce neoplastic-like cell transformation related to changes in intracellular iron, oxidative stress, and DNA damage, which could be prevented with an amorphous silica coating (SiO2-nFe2O3). To test this hypothesis, human bronchial epithelial cells (Beas-2B) were continuously exposed to 0.6 µg/cm2 administered dose of nFe2O3 (~0.58 µg/cm2 delivered dose), SiO2-nFe2O3 (~0.55 µg/cm2 delivered dose), or gas metal arc mild steel welding fumes (GMA-MS, ~0.58 µg/cm2 delivered dose) for 6. months. GMA-MS are composed of roughly 80% iron/iron oxide and were recently classified as a total human carcinogen. Our results showed that such low-dose/long-term in vitro exposure to nFe2O3 induced a time dependent neoplastic-like cell transformation, as indicated by increased cell proliferation and attachment independent colony formation, which closely matched that induced by GMA-MS. This transformation was associated with decreases in intracellular iron and reactive  species (ROS) production, and the induction of double stranded DNA damage. An amorphous silica-coated but otherwise identical particle (SiO2-nFe2O3) did not induce this neoplastic-like phenotype. Overall, the presented data suggests the carcinogenic potential with long term nFe2O3 exposure and the utility of an amorphous silica coating in "safe by design" hazard reduction strategy, using a physiologically relevant exposure scenario (low-dose/long-term) with model validation using GMA-MS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662259>Genotoxicity and DNA damage signaling in response to complex mixtures of PAHs in biomass burning particulate matter from cashew nut roasting.</a></h2><p>Approximately 3 billion people world-wide are exposed to air pollution from biomass burning. Herein, particulate matter (PM) emitted from artisanal cashew nut roasting, an important economic activity worldwide, was investigated. This study focused on: i) chemical characterization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and oxygenated (oxy-) PAHs; ii) intracellular levels of reactive  species (ROS); iii) genotoxic effects and time- and dose-dependent activation of DNA damage signaling, and iv) differential expression of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, inflammation, cell cycle arrest and DNA repair, using A549 lung cells. Among the PAHs, chrysene, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), benzo[b]fluoranthene, and benz[a]anthracene showed the highest concentrations (7.8-10 ng/m), while benzanthrone and 9,10-anthraquinone were the most abundant oxy-PAHs. Testing of PM extracts was based on B[a]P equivalent doses (B[a]P). IC values for viability were .7 and 3.0 nM B[a]P at 24 h and 48 h, respectively. At these low doses, we observed a time- and dose-dependent increase in intracellular levels of ROS, genotoxicity (DNA strand breaks) and DNA damage signaling (phosphorylation of the protein checkpoint kinase 1 - Chk1). In comparison, effects of B[a]P alone was observed at micromolar range. To our knowledge, no previous study has demonstrated an activation of pChk1, a biomarker used to estimate the carcinogenic potency of PAHs in vitro, in lung cells exposed to cashew nut roasting extracts. Sustained induction of expression of several important stress response mediators of xenobiotic metabolism (CYP1A1, CYP1B1), ROS and pro-inflammatory response (IL-8, TNF-α, IL-2, COX2), and DNA damage response (CDKN1A and DDB2) was also identified. In conclusion, our data show high potency of cashew nut roasting PM to induce cellular stress including genotoxicity, and more potently when compared to B[a]P alone. Our study provides new data that will help elucidate the toxic effects of low-levels of PAH mixtures from air PM generated by cashew nut roasting.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the present study was to detect microcirculatory alterations in healthy non-smokers after passive exposure to cigarette smoke, utilizing the Near Infrared Spectroscopy method combined with the vascular occlusion technique.Sixteen (9 females, age: 34 ± 9 years) non-smoking, healthy volunteers were exposed to passive smoking for 30 min in a temperature-controlled environment. Smoke concentration was monitored with a real-time particle counter. The following microcirculatory parameters were estimated: baseline tissue  saturation (StO); StO decrement after vascular occlusion (indicating the  consumption rate); StOincremental response after vascular occlusion release (reperfusion rate); the time period where the StO signal returns to the baseline values after the hyperemic response.Baseline StO (79.6 ± 6.4 vs. 79 ± 8%, p = 0.53) as well as the time needed for StO to return to baseline levels (138.2 ± 26. vs. 142.1 ± 34.6 s, p = 0.64) did not significantly differ before vs. after passive smoking exposure.  consumption rate decreased after 30 min exposure to passive smoking (from 12.8 ± 4.2 to 11.3 ± 2.8%/min, p = 0.04); Reperfusion rate also significantly decreased (from .6 ± 1.8 to  ± 1.7%/s, p = 0.04).Our results suggest that acute exposure to passive smoking delays peripheral tissue  consumption and adversely affects microcirculatory responsiveness after stagnant ischemia in healthy non-smokers.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Nuclear erythroid-related factor-2 (Nrf2) is a transcriptional regulator of several phase II antioxidant genes, including glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL). In this study, it was hypothesized that Crocin may mediate antioxidant signaling pathway to protect human lung epithelial cells against CS-mediated toxicity and oxidative stress via inducing glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis and activation of Nrf2 pathway. Alveolar epithelial cells (A549) were exposed to 1, 2. and % cigarette smoke extracts (CSE) with or without Crocin (500 μM). After 48 h exposure, the cytotoxicity, oxidant/antioxidant parameters and the Nrf2 pathway modification were assayed. Treatment of A549 cells with all concentrations of CSE dose dependently decreased cell viability, antioxidant levels, GCL and Nrf2 gene expression, which was associated with increased production of reactive  species. Crocin not only restored CSE-depleted GSH levels by enhancing GCL expression via activation of Nrf2 but also quenched the CSE-generation and release of reactive  species. Crocin attenuated CSE-mediated Nrf2 modifications, thereby inducing its nuclear accumulation associated with GCL gene transcription leading to enhanced GSH levels. By inducing GSH synthesis, Crocin attenuates CSE-mediated GSH depletion and protects cells against CSE-induced oxidative stress via Nrf2 pathway. These results may have implications in dietary modulation of natural antioxidants in treatment of pulmonary diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674629>Spin transport properties of 1,4,,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride based molecular devices.</a></h2><p>Using density functional theory combined with the nonequilibrium Green's function method, spin-dependent transport properties of molecular devices consisting of the 1,4,,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTCDA) molecule anchored via C and O linkages to zigzag graphene nanoribbon (ZGNR) electrodes were systematically investigated. Calculation results showed that the two connection modes display a good spin transport performance in both parallel (P) and anti-parallel (AP) configurations. Particularly,  connection significantly improves the spin filtration effect. These observations were validated by analyzing spin-resolved transmission spectra, band structures and spatial distribution of molecular orbitals within the bias window. Further comparison of the results of different models indicated that the linkage plays a crucial role in improving the spin transport properties for the proposed NTCDA-ZGNR system, giving them potential applications in high-performance multifunctional spintronic devices.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649219>Use of hyperbaric  therapy (HBOT) in chronic diabetic wound - A randomised trial.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of hyperbaric  therapy (HBOT) towards diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) patients in addition to the standard wound care management.Fifty-eight diabetic patients with ulcers at Wagner Grade 2 and above involved in this study after presented at two study centres of tertiary teaching hospitals. The assigned patients received conventional wound care with additional HBOT given at 2.4 ATA for 90 minutes. Patients in the control group who received conventional wound care only were treated and observed for 30 days. The progress of wound healing was observed and measured at day 0, 10, 20 and 30 of study. The data collected were analysed using SPSS software (ver. 22) to study the association of HBOT towards healing of the diabetic foot ulcers.Repeated Measures ANOVA analysis with Greenhouse-Geisser correction indicated that the means of wound size over time points (Day 0, 10, 20 and 30) among patients under HBOT group were statistically significantly different [F(1,61)=30.86, p<0.001)] compared to conventional therapy group.

Within them, physical activity, low-fat and high-fiber diets are distinguished as the main support for prevention, even when supplementation with nutraceuticals has become a very common practice. Fifty-two young sedentary men with excess body weight (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg·m) were enrolled in a randomized-crossover controlled trial [six weeks of a systematic physical exercise with  or placebo supplementation (4. g·day)]. Body composition, blood lipid profile, and maximal  uptake were determined pre/post intervention. Pairwise comparisons showed a significant improvement ( < 0.01) on blood lipid profile in the group of exercise plus . Moreover, correlations of absolute changes of BMI, body fat percentage, blood lipids and maximal  uptake were statistically significant ( < 0.01). These results indicate that the  supplementation could be acting in a synergistic way with exercise due to the enhanced effects on body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, and blood lipid profile.

Finding ways to increase iron uptake and to elevate the level of H2O2 in cells simultaneously is thus crucial to this strategy. Meanwhile, salicylic acid (SA) or its analogue, as the major metabolite of aspirin, has been reported to be closely associated with an intracellular redox-active product. In this work, a PEG-modified nanoscale coordination polymer (PFNC) via the self-assembly of -sulfosalicylic acid (SSA) with Fe3+ ions has been designed for the first time. The results show that the SSA dissociated from the PFNC can lead to the decrease of GSH and the accumulation of H2O2 in cancer cells, and thus elevate cellular ROS via the Fenton reaction. Owing to such intracellular oxidative stress, PFNC-induced ferroptotic cell death was further confirmed. In vitro cytotoxicity studies show that PFNCs display higher cytotoxicity on cancer cells than on normal cells. In vivo experiments further demonstrate that PFNCs not only possess high tumor accumulation, but also significantly inhibit the tumor growth without obvious damage toward the major organs. Based on the results, we expect that this work will provide an inspiration for understanding the role of SA, even aspirin, in the prevention of cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669903>Simultaneous Ammonium oxidation denitrifying (SAD) in an innovative three-stage process for energy-efficient mature landfill leachate treatment with external sludge reduction.</a></h2><p>High-loaded ammonia and low-strength organics mature landfill leachate is not effectively treated by conventional biological processes. Herein, an innovative solution was proposed using a three-stage Simultaneous Ammonium oxidation Denitrifying (SAD) process. Firstly, ammonia (1760 ± 126 mg N/L) in wastewater was oxidized to nitrite in a partial nitrification sequencing batch reactor (PN-SBR). Next, 93% PN-SBR effluent and concentrated external waste activated sludge (WAS; MLSS = 23057 ± 6014 mg/L) were introduced to an anoxic reactor for integrated fermentation and denitrification (IFD-SBR). Finally, ammonia (101.4 ± 13.8 mg N/L) released by fermentation in the IFD-SBR and residual 7% nitrite in the PN-SBR were removed through the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process in the SAD up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (SAD-UASB). In addition, NO-N generation during the anammox process could be reduced to nitrite by partial denitrification (PD) and reused as substrate for anammox. A satisfactory total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency (98.3%), external sludge reduction rate (2. kg/m d) and effluent TN concentration (16.7 mg/L) were achieved after long-term operation (280 days). The IFD-SBR and SAD-UASB contributed to 81.9% and 12.3% nitrogen removal, respectively. Microbial analysis showed that anammox bacteria (1.% Candidatus Brocadia) cooperated well with partial denitrifying bacteria (4.3% Thauera) in SAD-UASB, and average nitrogen removal contribution were 83.1% during significant stability of anammox and 9.2% during the denitrification process, respectively. The three-stage SAD process provides an environmental and economic approach for landfill leachate treatment since it has the advantage of 25.4% less , 100% organic matter savings and 47.9% less external sludge than traditional biological processes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we investigated the protective effects of fusidic acid on sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced toxicity in C6 glial cells. Fusidic acid (-20 μM) prevented SNP (100 μM)-induced cell death dose dependently, and effectively attenuated SNP-induced generation of nitric oxide (NO), total reactive  species (ROS), and peroxynitrite (ONOO). Fusidic acid (20 μM) pretreatment significantly suppressed SNP (100 μM)-induced apoptotic events, such as nuclear condensation and caspase-3 activation. In addition, fusidic acid effectively attenuated SNP-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers, such as GRP78, IRE1, ATF6, PERK, XBP1s, eIF2α, CHOP, and caspase-12. A specific adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor, compound C (10 μM), reversed the preventive effects of fusidic acid against SNP-induced cytotoxicity, CHOP elevation, and caspase-3 activation. These results suggest that fusidic acid can protect C6 glial cells against cytotoxicity, through the regulation of AMPK pathway and apoptotic events.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638783>Repurposing of Nitroxoline Drug for the Prevention of Neurodegeneration.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress has been documented as one of the significant causes of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, antioxidant therapy for the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases seems to be an interesting strategy in drug discovery. The quinoline-based compound, namely -nitro-8-quinolinol (NQ), has shown excellent antimicrobial, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activities. However, its neuroprotective effects and precise molecular mechanisms in human neuronal cells have not been elucidated. In this work, the effects of NQ on cell viability and morphology were evaluated by the MTT assay and microscopic observation. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms of this compound, inducing the survival rate of neuronal cells under oxidative stress, were investigated by reactive  species (ROS) assay, flow cytometry, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence techniques. In addition, the molecular interaction of sirtuin1 (SIRT1) with NQ was constructed using the AutoDock 4.2 program. Interestingly, NQ protected SH-SY5Y cells against HO-induced neurotoxicity through scavenging ROS, upregulating the levels of SIRT1 and FOXO3a, increasing the levels of antioxidant enzymes (catalase and superoxide dismutase), promoting antiapoptotic BCL-2 protein expression, and reducing apoptosis. Besides, molecular docking also revealed that NQ interacted satisfactorily with the active site of SIRT1 similar to the resveratrol, which is the SIRT1 activator and strong antioxidant. These findings suggest that NQ prevents oxidative-stress-induced neurodegeneration because of its antioxidant capacity as well as antiapoptotic property through SIRT1-FOXO3a signaling pathway. Thus, NQ might be a drug that could be repurposed for prevention of neurodegeneration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649393>A randomised prospective comparison of equilibration point and changing gas composition during low-flow anaesthesia with sevoflurane vs desflurane.</a></h2><p>Safety and economy are the main concerns while using low- flow anaesthesia with newer inhalational agents. The main objective of this study was to use and compare 'equilibration time' of sevoflurane and desflurane after change-over from high-to-low flow anaesthesia.This prospective study included consenting adult patients between 18-70 years undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia. Patients were randomised initially to receive high-flow anaesthesia with 1.3 MAC of either desflurane or sevoflurane with nitrous oxide. After equilibration point, low-flow anaesthesia was initiated. Heart rate, non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oximeter,  electrode ECG and gas monitoring was done. Statistical analysis was done with the help of Med CalC version 12..0.0 (student version) and IBM SPSS Version 20.0.Mean equilibration time in sevoflurane group was higher (4.59 ± 0.77 minutes) than desflurane group (3.78 ± 0.56 minutes,  < 0.001). Inspired concentrations of both inhalational agents varied from their vaporiser settings over 2 hours, more so with sevoflurane than desflurane. Inspired  concentration (FiO2) remained above 30% during anaesthesia in both groups with stable haemodynamics.Change-over from high-to-low flow anaesthesia is faster in desflurane. With fresh gas flow (FGF) of 1 L with 50%  and dial concentration of 1-1.% of sevoflurane and 3.8-4.4% of desflurane, the risk of hypoxia is minimal.

However, the cost of advanced treatments is proportional to the concentration of the pollutant. Therefore, improved bio-treatment efficiency is the key to reduce the treatment cost of MSWI leachate. In this study, the up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) -modified Bardenpho process was used for the treatment of MSWI leachate. The results showed that it was feasible to dilute the leachate by recirculation of the settling tank effluent, which has great significance in the bio-treatment efficiency. The treatment process achieved removal efficiencies of COD and NH-N of 97.-99.% and 99.3-99.7%, respectively. Adjustments to the operational conditions of the primary anoxic tank, such as adding an organic carbon source and increasing the hydraulic retention time and the nitrification reflux ratio resulted in a TN removal efficiency of 97.7-98.7%. Controlling the generation of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and increasing its removal efficiency significantly improved the TN removal efficiency. The concentrations of NH-N and TN in the settling tank effluent complied with the local leachate discharge standard, which minimized the cost of advanced treatment. The results provide new ideas for enhancing the bio-treatment efficiency of leachate and theoretical and technical support for reducing the cost of treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, the micro-environment controlled chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method has been adopted to synthesize high-quality single-crystalline CsPbBr3 microstructures, including microwires, microplates and triangular pyramids. Moreover, the structure-activity relationship between the material microstructures and the device properties is illustrated. The results show that photodetectors based on a single horizontal CsPbBr3 microwire exhibit a high responsivity (312.2 A W-1) and a fast response time of .8 ms. Photodetectors based on a single CsPbBr3 microplate exhibit a responsivity of 1.74 A W-1 and a response of 10 ms. These results indicate that the CsPbBr3 microwire photodetector is characterized by a higher photodetector performance when compared to the microplate due to its excellent crystallization quality and the Fabry-Pérot cavity effect in the microwire. Furthermore, the flexible CsPbBr3 microwire photodetector was demonstrated on a mica substrate. The results show that the photocurrent can be maintained at 90% after 3000 cycles at a bending radius of 2. mm. This work demonstrates the structure-activity photodetector performance, which is essential to develop a full understanding about high-performance optoelectronic devices based on all-inorganic lead halide perovskite materials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638031>Occurrence and molecular characterisation of Acanthamoeba isolated from recreational hot springs in Malaysia: evidence of pathogenic potential.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to identify the Acanthamoeba genotypes and their pathogenic potential in five recreational hot springs in Peninsular Malaysia. Fifty water samples were collected between April and September 2018. Physical parameters of water quality were measured in situ while chemical and microbiological analyses were performed in the laboratory. All samples were filtered through the nitrocellulose membrane and tested for Acanthamoeba using both cultivation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) by targeting the 18S ribosomal RNA gene. The pathogenic potential of all positive isolates was identified using thermo- and osmotolerance tests. Thirty-eight (76.0%) samples were positive for Acanthamoeba. Water temperature (P = 0.035), chemical  demand (P = 0.026), sulphate (P = 0.002) and Escherichia coli (P < 0.001) were found to be significantly correlated with the presence of Acanthamoeba. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 24 samples belonged to genotype T4, nine (T15), two (T3) and one from each genotype T5, T11 and T17. Thermo- and osmotolerance tests showed that 6 (15.79%) of the Acanthamoeba strains were highly pathogenic.

Echinacoside (ECH) is a phenylethanoid glycoside possessing prominent anti-inflammatory effects and various neuroprotective properties in the central nervous system, but the effect of ECH on SCI was rarely studied. Therefore, the purpose of this experiment was to look into the therapeutic effects of ECH on SCI and the underlying mechanisms.Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotion scale, Nissl staining, and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was employed to examine the therapeutic effects of ECH on SCI. In addition, reactive  species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in BV-2 cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharides and adenosine '-triphosphate were examined. The expression levels of proteins involving NLRP3 inflammasome-related pathway were measured.The in vivo experiment indicated that administration of ECH significantly enhanced the BBB scores, reduced the neuron loss, and ameliorated the tissue architecture after SCI. Additionally, ECH dramatically inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the rat SCI model. In vitro study indicated that ECH significantly reduced ROS level, improved the MMP, blocked activation of NF-κB, and inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway. The effect of ECH on inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway was partially governed by suppression of the generation of ROS and activation of NF-κB.ECH can accelerate motor function recovery in rats following SCI by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome-related signaling pathway, suggesting that ECH may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for treating SCI.Copyright © 2019.

In cardiac cells, spatiotemporal regulation of PKA activity is controlled by A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). This family of scaffolding proteins tether PKA and other transduction enzymes at subcellular microdomains where they can co-ordinate cellular responses regulating oxidative stress. In this review, we will discuss recent literature illustrating the role of PKA and AKAPs in modulating the detrimental impact of ROS production on cardiac function.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659168>Targeted knock-in mice expressing the oxidase-fixed form of xanthine oxidoreductase favor tumor growth.</a></h2><p>Xanthine oxidoreductase has been implicated in cancer. Nonetheless, the role played by its two convertible forms, xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) and oxidase (XO) during tumorigenesis is not understood. Here we produce XDH-stable and XO-locked knock-in (ki) mice to address this question. After tumor transfer, XO ki mice show strongly increased tumor growth compared to wild type (WT) and XDH ki mice. Hematopoietic XO expression is responsible for this effect. After macrophage depletion, tumor growth is reduced. Adoptive transfer of XO-ki macrophages in WT mice increases tumor growth. In vitro, XO ki macrophages produce higher levels of reactive  species (ROS) responsible for the increased Tregs observed in the tumors. Blocking ROS in vivo slows down tumor growth. Collectively, these results indicate that the balance of XO/XDH plays an important role in immune surveillance of tumor development. Strategies that inhibit the XO form specifically may be valuable in controlling cancer growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660070>Self-generating  enhanced mitochondrion-targeted photodynamic therapy for tumor treatment with hypoxia scavenging.</a></h2><p>Tumor hypoxia is an important reason for the limited therapeutic efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) because of the  requirement of the therapeutic process. PDT consumes tissue  and destroys tumor vasculature, further hampering its own efficacy in promoting tumor deterioration. Therefore, overcoming the photodynamic exacerbation of tumor hypoxia is urgent.  Herein, we report a photodynamic nanoparticle with sustainable hypoxia remission skills by both intratumoral HO catalysis and targeted mitochondrial destruction. The MnO@MSNs@IR780 nanoparticles are formed by absorbing a photosensitizer (IR780) into 90 nm mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) and capping the surface pores with  nm MnO nanoparticles.  These MnO nanoparticles can accumulate in tumors and respond to the HO-enriched tumor microenvironment by decomposing and catalyzing HO into O. Afterwards, IR780 is released and activated, spontaneously targeting the mitochondria due to its natural mitochondrial affinity. Under laser irradiation, this self-generated -enhanced PDT can destroy mitochondria and inhibit cell respiration, resulting in sustainable hypoxia remission in tumor tissues and consequently enhancing the therapeutic outcome.  experiments suggest that MnO@MSNs@IR780 exhibited highly mitochondrion-targeted properties and could sustainably inhibit tumor hypoxia. Additionally, the highest photoacoustic signal of HbO with the lowest Hb was observed in tumors from mice after PDT, indicating that these nanoparticles can also prevent tumor hypoxia .  Taken together, our study indicated a new approach for overcoming the sustainable hypoxia limitation in traditional PDT by targeted  supplementation and mitochondria destruction.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674398>Refractive index spectral dependence, Raman spectra, and transmission spectra of high-purity Ge, Ge, Ge, Ge, and Ge single crystals.</a></h2><p>The results of the precise measurement of the refractive index of stable germanium isotopes Ge72, Ge73, Ge74, and Ge76 single crystals with high enrichment and a germanium single-crystal Genat of natural isotopic composition with the Fourier-transform interference refractometry method from 1.94 to 20 μm with 0.1  cm resolution and accuracy of 2×10 to 1×10 are shown.

Conversely, there are sparse data evaluating its effects in stable COPD patients. We identified randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of delivering air or   NHF, compared with delivering the same gas without NHF, in stable COPD patients through a systematic search using MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Science Direct, and others sources until January 2019. Study selection, data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias (using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool) was performed by two independent authors. We included 6 studies (339 participants). Our meta-analysis showed a significant reduction of arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO) at long (two studies, MD -3 mmHg, [95% Confidence interval (CI) -4 to -2]) and short-term (two studies, MD -3 mmHg [95% CI -4 to -2]). NHF significantly improved quality of life on the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (two studies, MD - out of 100, [95% CI -8 to -2]).

This risk may be higher in children with congenital heart disease (CHD), particularly in those undergoing interventional cardiac catheterisation. It is therefore essential to adapt the anaesthetic strategy in these children to prevent from the occurrence of PRAE.To determine whether intranasal dexmedetomidine (DEX) premedication can reduce the incidence of PRAE in children with recent URI undergoing interventional cardiac catheterisation.Randomised controlled trial.Single-centre study based at a tertiary care centre in Shanghai, China.A total of 134 children with CHD aged 0 to 16 years with recent URI undergoing interventional cardiac catheterisation.Children were randomised to receive either intranasal DEX 1. μg kg (DEX group) or intranasal saline (Placebo group) 30 to 45 min before anaesthesia induction.The incidence of PRAE.Intranasal DEX significantly reduced the incidence of PRAE (P = 0.001), particularly  desaturation (P = 0.012). Most PRAE were observed during the emergence phase. The incidence of PRAE was comparable among the three types of left-right shunt CHD children in both groups. In children aged less than 3 years, the incidence of PRAE was significantly lower in the DEX group (P = 0.003). In contrast, the incidence of PRAE was comparable between the two groups in children aged at least 3 years. No differences in the incidence of emergence agitation, fever and vomiting between the two groups were noted.Administration of intranasal DEX 1. μg kg 30 to 45 min before induction led to a reduction in the incidence of PRAE in children aged less than 3 years with recent URI undergoing interventional cardiac catheterisation.chictr.org.cn identifier: ChiCTR-RRC-17012519.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639295>Unconventional p-d Hybridization Interaction in PtGa Ultrathin Nanowires Boosts  Reduction Electrocatalysis.</a></h2><p>Alloying 3d transition metals with Pt has been discovered as an effective strategy to boost the catalytic activity in  reduction reaction (ORR), which, however, often raises the insufficient catalyst durability issue due to rapid leaching of the 3d metal elements. To overcome this issue and realize enhancements in both the activity and the durability properties, here we report a new catalytic structure based on PtGa ultrathin alloy nanowires (NWs), which feature an unconventional strong p-d hybridization interaction. Relative to commercial Pt catalyst, the optimum PtGa NWs catalyst exhibited 10.- and 12.1-fold enhancement in the ORR mass activity and specific activity, respectively. Particularly, the PtGa NWs catalyst showed only 15.8% loss in the mass activity after 30 000 cycles of durability test, as compared to a big decrease of 79.6% for the commercial Pt catalyst. Our mechanistic studies find a strong p-d hybridization interaction between Ga and Pt that accounts for the improved ORR performance via synergistically optimizing the surface electronic structure, enhancing the oxidation resistance of Pt, and suppressing the leaching of lattice Ga. We believe this work provides new perspectives to design active and durable electrocatalysts toward ORR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650627>CO supplementation dissociates cerebral oxygenation and middle cerebral artery blood velocity during maximal cycling.</a></h2><p>This study evaluated whether the reduction of prefrontal cortex oxygenation (ScO ) during maximal exercise depends on the hyperventilation-induced hypocapnic attenuation of middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCA V ). Twelve endurance-trained males (age: 25 ± 3 years, height: 183 ± 8 cm, weight: 75 ± 9 kg; mean ± SD) performed in three separate laboratory visits, a maximal  uptake (VO max) test, an isocapnic (end-tidal CO tension (PetCO ) clamped at 40 ± 1 mmHg), and an ambient air controlled-pace constant load high intensity ergometer cycling to exhaustion, while MCA V (transcranial Doppler ultrasound) and ScO (NIRS) were determined. Duration of exercise (12 min 25 s ± 1 min 18 s) was matched by performing the isocapnic trial first. Pulmonary VO was 90 ± 6% vs. 93 ± % of the maximal value (P = 0.012) and PetCO 40 ± 1 vs. 34 ± 4 mmHg (P < 0.05) during the isocapnic and control trials, respectively. During the isocapnic trial MCA V increased by 16 ± 13% until clamping was applied and continued to increase (by 14 ± 28%; P = 0.017) until the end of exercise, while there was no significant change during the control trial (P = 0.071). In contrast, ScO decreased similarly in both trials (-3.2 ± .1% and -4.1 ± 9.6%; P < 0.001, isocapnic and control, respectively) at exhaustion.

Potential-energy surface for various channels for the oxidation of 2ME was studied at density function theory (M06-2X) and ab initio CBS-QB3 levels of theory. H-atom abstraction reactions, which are essential processes occurring in the initial stages of the combustion or oxidation of organic compounds, from different sites of 2ME were examined. A similar study was conducted for the isoelectronic n-butanol to highlight the consequences of replacing the ϒ CH group by an  atom on the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of the oxidation processes. Rate coefficients were calculated from the transition state theory. Our calculations show that energy barriers for n-butanol oxidation increase in the order of α ‹ O ‹ ϒ ‹ β ‹ ξ, which are consistent with previous data.

The effects of sitagliptin on  uptake (VO) and exercise hemodynamics have been unclear in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and coronary artery disease (CAD). Thirty patients with T2DM and CAD were randomized into a sitagliptin (50 mg/day) or voglibose (0.6 mg/day) group. Patients underwent maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing. VO and hemodynamics were evaluated at rest, anaerobic threshold and peak exercise. Resting LV diastolic function (E', peak early diastolic mitral annular velocity) and geometry were evaluated by echocardiography, and endothelial function by reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry. A total of 24 patients (69 ± 9 years) completed 6 months of intervention. Peak VO in the sitagliptin and voglibose groups (25.3 ± 7.3 vs. 24.0 ± 7.4, 22.7 ± 4.8 vs. 22.1 ± .2 ml/kg/min) was slightly decreased after 6 months (time effect p = 0.051; group × time effect p = 0.49). No effects were observed on LV ejection fraction, E', or reactive hyperemia index in either group. Heart rate during exercise was unaffected in both groups. Systolic blood pressure was unchanged by sitagliptin at rest and during exercise, but slightly lowered by voglibose at anaerobic threshold and peak exercise. In patients with T2DM and CAD, sitagliptin had little effect on resting LV and arterial function, exercise capacity, or exercise hemodynamics.

In this study, we outline a fully wet-chemical procedure for equipping a 3D carbon felt (CF) substrate with a multifunctional, titania nanospike supported Pt-Pd nanoparticle (Pt-Pd-TiO2@CF) layer in a facile and scalable manner. The nanostructure, composition, chemical speciation and formation of the material was meticulously investigated, evidencing the conformal coating of the substrate with a roughened layer of nanocrystalline rutile spikes by chemical bath deposition from Ti3+ solutions. The spikes are densely covered by bimetallic nanoparticles of 4.4 ± 1.1 nm size, which were produced by autocatalytic Pt deposition onto Pd seeds introduced by Sn2+ ionic layer adsorption and reaction. The as-synthesized nanocomposite was applied to the (photo)electrooxidation of formic acid (FA), exhibiting a superior performance compared to Pt-plated, Pd-seeded CF (Pt-Pd@CF) and commercial Pt-C, indicating the promoting electrocatalytic role of the TiO2 support. Upon UV-Vis illumination, the performance of the Pt-Pd-TiO2@CF electrode is remarkably increased (22-fold), generating a current density of 110 mA cm-2, distinctly outperforming titania-free Pt-Pd@CF ( mA cm-2) and commercial Pt-C (6 mA cm-2) reference catalysts. In addition, the Pt-Pd-TiO2@CF showed a much better stability, characterized by a very high poisoning tolerance for in-situ generated CO intermediates, whose formation is hindered in the presence of TiO2. This overall performance boost is attributed to a dual enhancement mechanism (~30% electrocatalytic, ~70% photoelectrocatalytic). The photo-generated electrons from the TiO2 conduction band enrich the electron density of the Pt nanoparticles, promoting the generation of active  species on their surfaces from adsorbed  and water molecules, which facilitate the direct FA electrooxidation into CO2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646859>Synthesis of Cyclic Alkenyl Dimethylsiloxanes from Alkynyl Benzyldimethylsilanes, and Application in Polyene Synthesis.</a></h2><p>Cyclic dimethylalkenylsiloxanes, useful motifs for (Z)-selective Hiyama cross-coupling, are accessed from alkynyl benzyldimethylsilanes featuring adjacent allylic or homoallylic  substituents by semi-hydrogenation / debenzylation / cyclization.

Fourteen healthy men participated. In phase I, an incremental bicycle exercise test was performed for establishment of intensities used in phase II and III. In phase II (9-16 days after phase 1), the participants performed first one high intensity performance cycling session, followed by nutrition supplementation (CHO-WP-MPH or CHO-WP) and 4 hours of recovery, before a subsequent high intensity performance cycling session. Phase III (1 week after phase II), was similar to phase II except for the nutrition supplementation, where the participants received the opposite supplementation compared to phase II. Primary outcome was difference in time to exhaustion between the cycling sessions, after nutrition supplementations containing MPH or without MPH. Secondary outcomes were differences in heart rate (HR), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), blood lactate concentration and glucose.The mean age of the participants was 45.6 years (range 40-58).

Bacteria are responsible for mineralizing steroids from the biosphere. Aerobic degradation of steroid hormones relies on O as a co-substrate of oxygenases to activate and to cleave the recalcitrant steroidal core ring. To date, two -dependent degradation pathways - the 9,10-seco pathway for androgens and the 4,-seco pathways for oestrogens - have been characterized. Under anaerobic conditions, denitrifying bacteria adopt the 2,3-seco pathway to degrade different steroid structures.

This concept includes "ion zoning", i.e. gradient distribution of ionic currents across the plasma membrane and free inorganic ions in the cytoplasm. One of the putative mechanisms for maintaining "ion zoning" is indicated by the sensitivity of the ion transport systems to reactive  species (ROS). Here we test the possibility of redox regulation of ionic gradients and membrane potential (MP) gradient in growing pollen tubes using quantitative fluorescence microscopy. ROS quencher MnTMPP and exogenic HO cause different alterations of intracellular Ca gradient, pH gradient and MP gradient during short-term exposure. MnTMPP significantly shifts the gradients of Ca and MP at low concentrations while high concentration cause growth alterations (ballooned tips) and cytoplasm acidification. HO at 0, and 1 mM affects ion homeostasis as well (MP, Ca, pH) but doesn't decrease viability or alter shape of the tubes.

Oxidized nucleotides such as 2'-deoxyribo--hydroxyuridin (HdU) and 2'-deoxyribo--hydroxymethyluridin (HMdU) can be inserted into DNA during replication and repair. HdU and HMdU have attracted particular interest because they have different effects on damaged-DNA processing enzymes that control the downstream effects of the lesions. Herein, we studied the chemically simulated translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) across the lesions formed by HdU or HMdU using microscale thermophoresis (MST). The thermodynamic changes associated with replication across HdU or HMdU show that the HdU paired with the mismatched deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates disturbs DNA duplexes considerably less than thymidine (dT) or HMdU. Moreover, we also demonstrate that TLS by DNA polymerases across the lesion derived from HdU was markedly less extensive and potentially more mutagenic than that across the lesion formed by HMdU. Thus, DNA polymerization by DNA polymerase η (polη), the exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (KF), and reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1 RT) across these pyrimidine lesions correlated with the different stabilization effects of the HdU and HMdU in DNA duplexes revealed by MST. The equilibrium thermodynamic data obtained by MST can explain the influence of the thermodynamic alterations on the ability of DNA polymerases to bypass lesions induced by oxidative products of pyrimidines. The results also highlighted the usefulness of MST in evaluating the impact of oxidative products of pyrimidines on the processing of these lesions by damaged DNA processing enzymes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639282>Cadmium and nickel co-exposure exacerbates genotoxicity and not oxido-inflammatory stress in liver and kidney of rats: Protective role of omega-3 fatty acid.</a></h2><p>The present study examined the influence of co-exposure to cadmium (Cd) and nickel (Ni) on hepatorenal function as well as the protective role of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3FA) in rats. The animals were exposed to Cd ( mg/kg) and Ni (150 μg/L in drinking water) singly or co-exposed to both metals and ω-3FA at 20 mg/kg for 14 consecutive days. Results showed that hepatorenal injury resulting from individual exposure to Cd or Ni was not aggravated in the co-exposure group. Moreover, ω-3FA markedly abrogated the reduction in the antioxidant enzyme activities, the increase in reactive  and nitrogen species, and lipid peroxidation induced by Cd and Ni co-exposure. Additionally, ω-3FA administration markedly suppressed the increase in hepatic and renal myeloperoxidase activity, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-1 β levels in the co-exposure group.

Chitosan/carrageenan (CSCR) nanoparticles are physically more stable than chitosan/gum arabic nanoparticles during in vitro digestion and were selected for the oral delivery of BUCA. Under simulated intestinal conditions, BUCA-loaded CSCR nanoparticles showed significantly more stable antioxidant activity and total phenolic content than non-nanoencapsulated BUCA. The highest antioxidant stability was observed in the BUCA-loaded CSCR nanoparticles prepared with 0.2 mg/mL carrageenan, which showed 2-times higher ORAC value and 10-times higher total phenolic content than non-nanoencapsulated BUCA after 12 h of in vitro digestion.CSCR nanoencapsulation of natural antioxidants could be an effective technique for improving antioxidant stability during digestion.

In order to fully exert the potential of PA imaging in biomedical applications, new contrast agents with improved PA stability and efficiency are highly demanded. Herein, we present a new PA agent based on -embedded quinoidal nonacene chromophore that is self-assembled into nanoparticle (Nano(O-Nonacene)-PEG), assisted by polyethylene glycol (PEG). Notably, the photothermal conversion efficiency of Nano(O-Nonacene)-PEG is 1. folds that of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (Nano(PCPDTBT)-PEG), and 2.8 folds that of Au nanorods, owing to the low quantum yield of Nano(O-Nonacene)-PEG. And thereby, Nano(O-Nonacene)-PEG possess the greatly elevated PA signal intensity, compared to Nano(PCPDTBT)-PEG and Au nanorods, which have been widely explored for PA imaging. Due to the high resistance to photo bleaching, Nano(O-Nonacene)-PEG exhibits higher PA signal stability, which may be employed for long-term PA imaging. Moreover, when magnetic Zn0.4Fe2.6O4 nanoparticles are incorporated into Nano(O-Nonacene)-PEG, not only magnetic resonance signals are generated, but also the photoacoustic efficacy is greatly enhanced. Therefore, Nano(O-Nonacene)-PEG offer distinct properties: (i) The elevated photoacoustic effect allows for high-resolution photoacoustic imaging; (ii) Small size (10 nm in diameter) results in efficient tumor-targeting; (iii) The facile application of efficient photothermal therapy in vivo. The current work opens a possibility of -embedded quinoidal acene as a promising PA probe for precision phototheranostics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637898>Management of mild, primary Raynaud Syndrome: supplementation with Pycnogenol®.</a></h2><p>Raynaud syndrome (RS) is associated with vasospasm of the hand and fingers as a response to cold or stress. RS may cause discomfort and color changes (pallor, cyanosis, erythema, as single symptoms, but usually in combination, localized to one or more fingers). The aim of this 4-week registry study was the evaluation of subjects with mild, primary RS and their treatment with a standard management (SM) plan in comparison with SM associated with supplementation with Pycnogenol®.A group of 67 females with mild, primary RS was included. All subjects were working in shops with refrigerators. No skin lesions were present. The age range was between 30 and 40; the vasospastic changes were symmetrical; no other physical findings were present.The two groups, receiving standard management (N.=33) or SM+Pycnogenol®, 100 mg/day, (N.=34) were comparable at inclusion. Considering the main symptoms, the decrease in coldness, burning pain, paresthesias and irregular color changes was more significant with Pycnogenol® (P<0.05) at 4 weeks. At thermography, low temperature areas and discrepancies in temperature and color were decreased with Pycnogenol® more than in controls (P<0.05). In the Pycnogenol® group, one subject (2.94%) decided to use drug treatment (PGE1) in 4 weeks in comparison with  controls (15.15%). The lowest finger temperature improved from 20.3° C at inclusion to 26.4° C at 4 weeks (+30.04%) with Pycnogenol® in comparison with lower values (from 20. to 23.1 [+12.7%] in controls [P<0.05]). The fingertip skin flux increased significantly (+ 1.55 flux units) with Pycnogenol® (P<0.05), in controls just by +0.14 (ns). Supplementation with Pycnogenol® decreased oxidative stress and increased transcutaneous  pressure (TcPO2) more than in controls. Compliance and tolerability were optimal.This pilot registry study suggests that Pycnogenol® may be used with significant advantages in primary, mild RS. Subjects using Pycnogenol® may control their symptoms and may avoid the need for more complex and, potentially dangerous or expensive treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654481>Short-time effect of intravitreal injections on retinal vascular oxygenation and vessel diameter in patients with diabetic macular oedema or neovascular age-related macular degeneration.</a></h2><p>To investigate the short-time effect of intravitreal injections (IVI) of the vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors ranibizumab and aflibercept on retinal arterial and venous  saturation (SO2a and SO2v), arteriovenous  saturation difference (AVD) and vessel diameter (VDa and VDv) in patients with diabetic macular oedema (DME) and patients with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to age-related macular degeneration.Uncontrolled prospective observational study in 100 eyes. Retinal vessel  saturation and diameters were assessed using a retinal oximeter before and minutes after IVI of ranibizumab or aflibercept.40 eyes with CNV and 34 eyes with DME were included in the analysis. At baseline, SO2a and SO2v were significantly higher in DME (p = 0.043 and p = 0.009, respectively). After IVI, SO2a significantly decreased in CNV and DME eyes by 2.6% (p = 0.016) and 4.6% (p = 0.002) and SO2v decreased by 14.0% (p = 0.004) and 12.4% (p = 0.017), respectively. However, a significant increase in AVD was only found in CNV (15.7%, p = 0.001). VDa decreased significantly only in DME by .7% (p = 0.010). No medication-specific disease effect was found and vice versa.The observed changes can be interpreted as signs of increased metabolic demand during the physiological stress after an IVI. The abnormal arterial constriction and the abolished increase in AVD seen only in eyes with DME indicate an impairment of vascular autoregulation and  distribution and a reduced neuroretinal metabolism in the diabetic retina with a significant impact on inner retinal  consumption shortly after IVI.© 2019 The Authors.

However, excessive autophagy can be deleterious to cardiomyocytes. CCN1/Cyr61, a matricellular protein, is expressed in the stressed heart to induce cardiomyopathy. The role of autophagy in CCN1-associated cardiotoxicity was not clear. Here, we found that autophagy was induced in the myocardium of the isoproterenol (ISO; 100 mg/kg/day for  days; s.c.) treated mice, where CCN1 expression is colocalized. The knock-in mice carrying an integrin α6β1-binding-defective mutant allele Ccn1-dm were resistant to the ISO-induced cardiac injury and autophagy. Our in vitro studies demonstrated that CCN1 dose- and time-dependently induced GFP-LC3-labeled autophagosome formation in rat cardiomyoblast H9c2 cells. The formation of autolysosomes in response to CCN1 ( μg/ml; 3 h) treatment was identified by the acridine orange staining. The autophagy induction was confirmed by the elevated protein levels of Beclin 1, Atg5, and LC3-II, and the decrease of p62. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine or by silencing Atg5 gene enabled CCN1-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells, suggesting a protective role of autophagy. CCN1 binds to integrin α6β1 to induce autophagy through reactive  species, and the activation of ERK and JNK. Furthermore, mitophagy was observed after CCN1 treatment for the clearance of depolarized mitochondria. Together, these results demonstrated that autophagy is induced in response to CCN1/α6β1 signaling in cardiomyocytes to alleviate CCN1-associated cardiotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670084>Highly reduced ecotoxicity of ZnO-based micro/nanostructures on aquatic biota: Influence of architecture, chemical composition, fixation, and photocatalytic efficiency.</a></h2><p>Developing efficient sunlight photocatalysts with enhanced photocorrosion resistance and minimal ecotoxicological effects on aquatic biota is critical to combat water contamination. Here, the role of chemical composition, architecture, and fixation on the ecotoxicological effects on microalgae of different ZnO and ZnO@ZnS based water decontamination photocatalysts was analyzed in depth. In particular, the ecotoxicological effects of films, nanoparticles and biomimetic micro/nano-ferns were carefully assessed by correlating the algae's viability to the Zn(II) release, the photocatalyst-microalgae interaction, and the production of reactive  species (ROS). The results showed a drastic improvement in algal viability for supported ZnO@ZnS core@shell micro/nanoferns, as their ecotoxicity after 96 h light exposure was significantly lower (3.7-10.0% viability loss) compared to the ZnO films (18.4-35.% loss), ZnO micro/nanoferns (28.-53.% loss), ZnO nanoparticles (48.3-91.7% loss) or ZnO@ZnS nanoparticles (8.6-19.2% loss) for catalysts concentrations ranging from 25 mg L to 400 mg L. In particular, the ZnO@ZnS micro/nanoferns with a concentration of 400 mg L exhibited excellent photocatalytic efficiency to mineralize a multi-pollutant solution (81.4 ± 0.3% mineralization efficiency after 210 min under UV-filtered visible light irradiation) and minimal photocorrosion (<% of photocatalyst dissolution after 96 h of UV-filtered visible light irradiation). Remarkably, the ZnO@ZnS micro/nanoferns showed lower loss of algal viability (9.8 ± 1.1%) after 96 h of light exposure, with minimal reduction in microalgal biomass (9.1 ± 1.0%), as well as in the quantity of chlorophyll-a (9. ± 1.0%), carotenoids (8.6 ± 0.9%) and phycocyanin (.6 ± 0.6%). Altogether, the optimized ZnO@ZnS core@shell micro/nanoferns represent excellent ecofriendly photocatalysts for water remediation in complex media, as they combine enhanced sunlight remediation efficiency, minimal adverse effects on biological microorganisms, high reusability and easy recyclability.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This synthetic pyrazolone derivative is a potent scavenger of  free radicals and also functions as a modulator of transcription factors, repressing NFκB and activating Nrf2, to regulate oxidative stress. EDA displays complementary anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. The injectable small molecule is currently investigated for the treatment of several non-neurological diseases. The potential interest of EDA in oncology is reviewed here. EDA is a mild antiproliferative agent but has been found to enhance significantly the anticancer and antimetastatic activities of irinotecan in a colon cancer model. Anticancer derivatives of EDA have been designed but they generally display a limited antiproliferative activity. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of EDA can be best exploited to protect non-tumor cells from damages induced by chemotherapeutic drugs and radiations. Notably EDA can reduce the renal dysfunction induced by cisplatin, the neurotoxicity of cyclophosphamide and the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin. Upon treatment with EDA, a significant improvement in neurologic symptoms has been observed in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy. The drug could be used to limit radiation-induced brain injury or oral mucositis. EDA was found to ameliorate autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis), which is a frequent side effect observed after treatment of cancer patients with monoclonal antibodies targeting the immune checkpoint PD-1. Therefore, EDA could also be useful to reduce specific side effects of immuno-therapy. Collectively, the information suggests that the medical use of EDA, a drug with a proven safety after 18 years of use in brain-related Human diseases, could be extended to cancer-related conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, mixed signals of anoxia and oxygenation in the sulfur isotope record between 2. to 2.3 billion years (Ga) ago require independent clarification, for example via  isotopes in sulfate. Here we show <2.31 Ga sedimentary barium sulfates (barites) from the Turee Creek Basin, W. Australia with positive sulfur isotope anomalies of ∆S up to + 1.55‰ and low δO down to -19.‰. The unequivocal origin of this combination of signals is sulfide oxidation in meteoric water. Geochemical and sedimentary evidence suggests that these S-isotope anomalies were transferred from the paleo-continent under an oxygenated atmosphere. Our findings indicate that incipient oxidative continental weathering, ca. 2.8-2. Ga or earlier, may be diagnosed with such a combination of low δO and high ∆S in sulfates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660719>Carbon-Based Catalyst Synthesized and Immobilized under Calcium Salt Assistance to Boost Singlet  Evolution for Pollutant Degradation.</a></h2><p>Carbon-based materials are recognized as promising candidates for pollutant degradation because of their environmental benignity. Massive and cost-effective production and efficient recovery of carbon-based catalysts are crucial to apply this technology. However, various nanostructured carbons with different dimensions are usually utilized as precursors while not considering their complex preparation procedures and the high costs of ingredients. Moreover, catalyst separation and recovery are not given sufficient attention. In this work, a calcium salt - assisted pyrolysis strategy is proposed to tune the catalytic site formation of carbon-based catalysts. Results show that blending equal amounts of Ca2+ (calcium chloride) and organic precursors could greatly improve the catalytic activity of the carbonated product to activate peroxymonosulfate for pollutant degradation. In addition, the proposed synthetic strategy is universal to most of the readily accessed and cost-effective organic precursors. Singlet  is identified as the main reactive oxidant for pollutant removal in the catalytic reaction. By crosslinking calcium ion and alginate as a hydrogel to immobilize the catalyst, the carbon material could be readily recovered. Furthermore, a long-term continuous-flow reactor test is conducted to validate the effectiveness of applying the immobilized catalyst to treat a synthetic wastewater with 0.-mM bisphenol A. As a result, a green synthesis and immobilization strategy for persulfate catalysts is successfully established, and the prepared catalyst might be applied for wastewater treatment through using calcium salt in two purposes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652436>Extracellular matrix: the gatekeeper of tumor angiogenesis.</a></h2><p>The extracellular matrix is a network of secreted macromolecules that provides a harmonious meshwork for the growth and homeostatic development of organisms.

During cancer growth, this bioactive meshwork is remodeled and enriched in newly formed blood vessels, which provide nutrients and  to the growing tumor cells. Remodeling of the tumor microenvironment leads to the formation of bioactive fragments that may have a distinct function from their parent molecules, and the balance among these factors directly influence cell viability and metastatic progression. Indeed, the matrix acts as a gatekeeper by regulating the access of cancer cells to nutrients.

A secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized trial of antenatal corticosteroids for women at risk for late preterm birth. Singleton, nonanomalous, AGA or SGA births that delivered at 34-36 weeks were included. Women were excluded if they delivered after 37 weeks or had a large for gestational age baby (LGA; weight over 90th for gestational age). The primary outcome was a composite of any of the following: respiratory support by 72 h (continuous positive airway pressure or high flow nasal cannula ≥2 h,  with a fraction of inspired  of ≥30% for ≥4 h, extra corporeal membrane oxygenation or mechanical ventilation) or neonatal death. The secondary outcomes included several neonatal and maternal morbidities. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to examine the association between neonatal weight and outcomes (using adjusted relative risk [aRR] and 95% confidence intervals [CI]).  Of the 2831 women in the parent trial, 2315 (82%) women met inclusion criteria; among them, 426 (18%) of the neonates were SGA. There was no significant difference in the risk of the primary outcome between SGA and AGA (13.1 versus 15.1%, aRR 0.85, 95% CI 0.66-1.10). SGA, however, was associated with an increased risk for neonatal intensive care unit admission (68 versus 45%, aRR 1.60, 95% CI 1.47-1.74), hypothermia (12.2 versus 8.8%, aRR 1.36, 95% CI 1.01-1.83), feeding problems (47.2 versus 36.9%, aRR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.45) and a decreased risk of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (7. versus 12.7%, aRR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41-0.84), when compared to AGA.

The mononuclear complex 1 reacts with dioxygen to decarboxylate the iron-coordinated benzilate. The oximate-bridged dinuclear complex (2), which contains a high-spin (Tp)Fe unit and a low-spin iron(II)-oximate unit, activates dioxygen at the high-spin iron(II) center. Both the complexes exhibit the oxidative transformation of oximes to the corresponding carbonyl compounds with the incorporation of one  atom from dioxygen. In the oxidation process, the oxime units are converted to nitric oxide (NO) or nitroxyl (HNO). The iron(II)-benzilate complex (1) reacts with oximes to afford HNO, whereas the iron(II)-oximate complex (2) generates NO. The results described here suggest that the oxidative transformation of oximes to NO/HNO follows different pathways depending upon the nature of co-ligand/reductant.Graphic abstract.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649774>Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury due to Iatrogenic IVIG Overdose in Guillain-Barre Syndrome.</a></h2><p>Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a transfusion-related adverse effect associated with high mortality, manifesting with acute respiratory distress and with features of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

Since 1950, chicken embryonated eggs have been used as the main method for producing seasonal influenza vaccines. However, this platform has the main drawback of a lack of scale-up flexibility, and thus, egg-based vaccine manufacturers cannot supply sufficient doses within a short period for use for pandemic prevention. As a result, strategies for reducing the manufacturing time and increasing production capacity are urgently needed. Non-virion vaccine methods have been considered an alternative strategy against an influenza pandemic, and the purpose of maintaining an immunogenic capsule structure with infectious properties appears to be met by the virus-like particle (VLP) platform.An influenza H7N9-TW VLP production platform using insect cells, which included the expression of hemagglutinin (HA), NA, and M1 proteins, was established. To scale up H7N9-TW VLP production, several culture conditions were optimized to obtain a higher production yield. A high level of dissolved  could be critical to H7N9-TW VLP production. If the DO was maintained at a high level, the HA titer obtained in the spinner flask system with ventilation was similar to that obtained in a shake flask. In this study, the HA titer in a -L bioreactor with a well-controlled DO level was substantially improved by 128-fold (from 4 HA units (HAU)/50 μL to 512 HAU/50 μL).In this study, a multigene expression platform and an effective upstream process were developed. Notably, a high H7N9-TW VLP yield was achieved using a two-step production strategy while a high DO level was maintained. The upstream process, which resulted in high VLP titers, could be further used for large-scale influenza VLP vaccine production.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657417>Electronic modulation of composite electrocatalysts derived from layered NiFeMn triple hydroxide nanosheets for boosted overall water splitting.</a></h2><p>Herein, we report the synthesis of Fe and Mn co-doped Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays (FM-NS NSAs) as well as layered NiFeMn triple hydroxide (NiFeMn-LTH)/FM-NS hybrid NSAs (HNSAs) via an easily controllable sulfidation method with NiFeMn-LTH NSAs as the precursor, which can be employed as coupled  evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrodes to achieve boosted overall water splitting performance.

Recent observational research has suggested a relationship between RBC death (eryptosis) and hypoxemia in hemodialysis patients. Thus, we studied the isolated and joint effects of a uremic toxin (indoxyl sulfate; IS) and hypoxia on RBC biology.We incubated RBC from healthy donors with IS at concentrations of 0.01mM, 0.09mM and 0.17mM under both normoxic (21% O) and hypoxic (% O) conditions for 24 hours. Eryptosis was evaluated by RBC phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, cell volume, and cytosolic calcium which were quantified by Annexin-V+, forward scatter, and Fluo-3AM+ binding, respectively. RBC redox balance was reported by reactive  species (ROS) production and intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH). Analyses were performed by flow cytometry.Hypoxia induced a 2-fold ROS production compared to normoxia. PS exposure and cytosolic calcium increased, while cell volume decreased by hypoxia and likewise by IS. IS increased ROS production in a dose-dependent manner under conditions of both normoxia and hypoxia. The same conditions promoted a GSH decrease with IS intensifying the hypoxia-induced effects.In summary, our results indicate that the concurrent presence of hypoxia and uremia augments RBC death and may therefore, contribute to the genesis of anemia in CKD.© Copyright by the Author(s).

We determined the bladder reactive  species (ROS) amount by an ultrasensitive chemiluminescence analyzer, the expression of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) by Western blot and the expression of multiple cytokine profiles, including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 through a cytokine array. ITG extract contains 1.07% of Daidzin through high-performance liquid chromatography. The effect of ITG extract and Daidzin in scavenging hydrogen peroxide activity was more efficient than distilled water. CYP-induced higher urination frequency, shorter intercontraction interval, and lower maximal voiding pressure in the bladders and these symptoms were significantly ameliorated in CYP+ITG and CYP+Daidzin groups. The amount of in vivo bladder ROS and the expression of 3-NT and NOX4 expressions were significantly increased in CYP group but were efficiently decreased in the CYP+ITG and CYP+Daidzin groups. CYP-induced fibrosis, hemorrhage, leukocyte infiltration, and edema in the bladders were significantly attenuated in the CYP+ITG and CYP+Daidzin groups. These results suggested that ITG extract and its active component Daidzin effectively improved CYP-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis through inhibiting the MMP-8, TIMP-1, and oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672481>Low intensity rowing with blood flow restriction over  weeks increases V̇Omax in elite rowers: A randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>The present randomized controlled intervention study examined the effects of practical blood flow restriction (pBFR) on maximal  uptake (V̇Omax) during low intensity rowing.Thirty-one elite rowers were either assigned to the intervention (INT) or control (CON) group, using the minimization method (Strata: Gender, Age, Height, V̇Omax).While INT (n=16; 4 female, 12 male, 21.9±3.2 years, 180.4±8.7cm, 73.6±10.9kg, V̇Omax: 63.0±7.9ml/min/kg) used pBFR during boat- and indoor-rowing training, CON (n=15, 4 female, 11 male, 21.7±3.7 years, 180.7±8.1cm, 72.±12.1kg, V̇Omax: 63.2±8.5ml/min/kg) completed the identical training without pBFR. pBFR of the lower limb was applied via customized elastic wraps. Training took place three times a week over  weeks (accumulated net pBFR: 60min/week; occlusion per session: 2-times 10min/session) and was used exclusively at low intensities (<2mmol/L). A spiroergometric ramp test (V̇Omax; 30-40W/min increase) on rowing-ergometer and one-repetition maximum test of the squat exercise (SQ1RM) was employed to assess endurance and strength capacity.Significant group×time interactions (η²=0.26) in favor of INT were found for V̇Omax (+9.1±6.2%, Effect Size=1.3) compared to CON (+2.±6.1%, ES=0.3). SQ1RM (η²=0.01) was not affected by the pBFR intervention.This study revealed that 15 sessions of pBFR application with a cumulative total pBFR load of 5h over a  weeks macrocycle remarkably increased V̇Omax. Thus, pBFR might serve as a promising means to improve aerobic capacity in highly trained elite rowers.Copyright © 2019 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Seventeen individuals were submitted to two experimental SS session: Order "A" (larger to small muscles groups) and Order "B" (small to larger muscles groups). Heart rate (HR), systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), rate-pressure product (RPP)  saturation (SpO), and heart rate variability (HRV) were measured at rest, midpoint of the session, immediately after the session, and in , 10, and 20 minutes after. SS increased HR and RPP in both orders, while reducing the rMSSD index and SpO. In the order "A", the SBP and DBP increased at the midpoint of the session. In the order "B", the SBP and DBP increased only immediately after the end of the session. DBP and RPP significantly higher in order "A" compared to order "B" in the midpoint of the session. It was also demonstrated higher values of DBP and minor mean R-R intervals in order "B" at 10 min-post session. SS increased cardiac overload in both performed orders. The overload generated by the SS of the larger muscles groups was greater when compared to the smaller muscles groups, suggesting that the exercise order interferes in cardiac overload.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651674>Factors Associated with Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation and Re-Ventilation in Acute Cervical Spinal Cord Injury Patients.</a></h2><p>Patients who had suffered from acute blunt cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) and admitted our hospital within 24 hours after injury were included in the study.We compared the respiratory function and serum reactive oxidative stress (ROS) after acute cervical SCI, and tried to find out the valuable predictors of weaning in acute cervical SCI patients.Ventilation impairment is a major complication of acute cervical SCI. Evidence of  radical formation in secondary injury from animal SCI models demonstrates an immediate post-injury increase in ROS production after SCI. We hypothesis the serum ROS is associated with the severity of patients with acute cervical SCI.38 adult patients who had acute cervical SCI and 58 healthy volunteers were enrolled. Respiratory function at admission, at the time of extubation and at 48 hours after extubation, serum oxidative stress, Injury Severity Score (ISS) and Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score at admission were compared.The most notable predictor of mechanical ventilator > 48 hours was serum thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) level at admission (p = 0.027), and the cut-off value of serum TBARS level was 731.7 μmol/L (sensitivity 87.% and specificity 78.9%). For the re-ventilation ≤  days, the notable predictors were respiratory function at the time of extubation (maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), p = 0.040; maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), p = 0.020; and tidal volume (TV), p = 0.036) and serum TBARS level at admission (p = 0.013), the cut-off value of serum TBARS level at admission was 762.3 μmol/L (sensitivity 100% and specificity 90.0%).In this study, respiratory function (MIP, MEP and TV) at the time of extubation can be useful optimal clinical guidelines for weaning and extubation attempts in patients with acute cervical SCI.

The results show that ranges of hydrogen and  isotopic composition (δH: -68.8‱ to -40.8‱, δO: -10.05‱ to -.05‱) are controlled by the medium latitude and high altitude of the UPRB. Among different types of water, the δH and δO values can be ordered as follows: reservoir water < spring water ≈ river water < pond water. The water of the upstream medium and small reservoir is enriched with lighter isotopes that is likely related to more exchange with rainwater and less residence time; however, large reservoirs are similar to the upstream river and spring in terms of the H-O isotopic composition. Hydro-chemical facies are dominated by the Ca-HCO type in the UPRB, which reflects fresh recharged water from rainfall, and few samples are of the Ca-Cl type that is caused by intensive evaporation. The water quality for irrigation purposes was also evaluated. According to the Wilcox diagram, United States Salinity Laboratory (USSL) diagram, magnesium hazard, and Kelly's ratio, all water samples have been considered suitable for irrigation water.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641713>Novel anti-HER2 peptide-conjugated theranostic nanoliposomes combining NaYF:Yb,Er nanoparticles for NIR-activated bioimaging and chemo-photodynamic therapy against breast cancer.</a></h2><p>Herein, we reported the fabrication of novel peptide-conjugated ligand-targeted nanoliposomes (LTLs) for chemo-photodynamic therapy against HER2-positive breast cancer. The LTL core was utilized for encapsulating doxorubicin (DOX) for chemotherapy, and methylene blue (MB) attached NaYF4:Yb,Er upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) for NIR-activated bioimaging and leveraging its visible emission for photoexciting MB for enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT). The specificity of our LTLs was achieved by conjugating a newly discovered anti-HER2 peptide screened from a phage display peptide library. The high selectivity of the peptide-conjugated LTLs was confirmed by confocal imaging of SKBR-3 (HER2-positive) and MCF-7 (HER2-negative) breast cancer cell lines, illustrating its target-specific nature. The energy transfer from UCNPs to MB was verified, thus enabling the generation of reactive  species upon activation with a 975 nm laser source (0.60 W cm-2) under  min continuous excitation. A significant decline in the cell viability by 95% was observed using chemo-photodynamic combinational therapy, whereas for chemo-drug alone and PDT alone, the cell proliferation declined by 77% and 84%, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated an improved uptake of the LTLs inside a 3D model of SKBR-3 tumor spheroids, where the spheroid cell viability was suppressed by 66% after the use of combinational therapy. Thus, our results suggest great prospective use of theranostic LTLs for breast cancer management.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647612>Mixed Copper/Copper-Oxide Anchored Mesoporous Fullerene Nanohybrids as Superior Electrocatalysts toward  Reduction Reaction.</a></h2><p>Developing a highly active, stable, and efficient non-noble metal-free functional electrocatalyst to supplant the benchmark Pt/C-based catalysts in practical fuel cell applications remains a stupendous challenge. A rational strategy is developed to directly anchor highly active and dispersed copper (Cu) nanospecies on mesoporous fullerenes (referred to as Cu-MFC ) toward enhancing  reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis. The preparation of Cu-MFC involves i) the synthesis of ordered MFC via the prevalent nanohard templating technique and ii) the postfunctionalization of MFC with finely distributed Cu nanospecies through incipient wet impregnation. The concurrence of Cu and cuprous oxide nanoparticles in the as-developed Cu-MFC samples through relevant material characterizations is affirmed. The optimized ORR catalyst, Cu(15%)-MFC , exhibits superior electrocatalytic ORR characteristics with an onset potential of 0.860 vs reversible hydrogen electrode, diffusion-limiting current density (-.183 mA cm ), improved stability, and tolerance to methanol crossover along with a high selectivity (four-electron transfer). This enhanced ORR performance can be attributed to the rapid mass transfer and abundant active sites owing to the synergistic coupling effects arising from the mixed copper nanospecies and the fullerene framework.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Anthracene reduced the growth rate (μ) and levels of chlorophyll a (Chl a), chlorophyll b (Chl b), and total carotenoids. The growth rate was more sensitive than photosynthetic parameters, with a median effective concentration (EC) of 4.28 mg L. Between  and 15 mg L, anthracene inhibited the maximum quantum yield (F/F) of photosystem II (PSII) and the maximum photosynthetic electron transport rate through PSII (rETR) with EC values of 14.88 and 11.8 mg L, respectively. At all anthracene concentrations, intracellular reactive  species (ROS) were elevated, indicating increased oxidative stress. Anthracene presumably reduced the PSII efficiency of photochemical energy regulation and altered the photochemistry through intracellular ROS formation. Acute exposure to PAHs may induce severe physiological changes in phytoplankton cells, which may influence vital ecological processes within the aquatic environments. Additionally, growth and Chl a content may serve as sensitive risk assessment parameters of anthracene toxicity in water management since EC values for both overlap with anthracene levels (8.3 mg L) permitted by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640183>Water Extract of  L. Ameliorates Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Our aim was to investigate whether hot water extract (CLW) of  L. could prevent non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). HepG2 cells were treated with free fatty acid (FFA) mixture (oleic acid: palmitic acid, 2:1) for 24 h to stimulate in vitro fatty liver. In addition, C57BL/6 mice were fed 60 kcal% high-fat (HF) diet for eight weeks to induce fatty liver in vivo. Intracellular reactive  species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) productions were increased by FFA and HF-diet, but supplementation with CLW significantly decreased these levels. CLW treatment ameliorated antioxidant activities that were suppressed by exposure to the FFA and HF-diet. Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and fatty acid transport proteins (FATP2 and FATP5) were increased in HF-diet groups, while CLW suppressed their expression levels. Moreover, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), and fatty acid synthase (FAS) expression levels were down-regulated in the CLW groups compared to HF-diet groups. On the other hand, ' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1) expressions were up-regulated in the CLW groups. HF-diet fed mice showed high hepatic triglycerides (TG) content compared to the normal diet mice. However, the administration of CLW restored the hepatic TG level, indicating an inhibitory effect against lipid accumulation by CLW. These results suggest that CLW could be a potentially useful agent for the prevention of NAFLD through modulating fatty acid uptake.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674636>A tannic acid-modified fluoride pre-treated Mg-Zn-Y-Nd alloy with antioxidant and platelet-repellent functionalities for vascular stent application.</a></h2><p>Vascular stent interventional therapy, as a regular and effective therapy, has been widely used to treat coronary artery diseases. However, adverse events occur frequently after stent intervention, especially restenosis and late stent thrombosis. The targeted implanting site will suffer from severe atherosclerosis, which is considered as a chronic inflammatory disease. Meanwhile, with the over-expanding use of endovascular mechanical intervention, vascular injury has become an increasingly common issue. Lesions and newly induced vascular injury result in inflammatory and oxidative stress; meanwhile, activated macrophages and granulocytes generate high levels of reactive  species (ROS), contributing to endothelial dysfunction and neointima hyperplasia. Therefore, attenuating oxidative stress and reducing ROS generation in the inflammatory response represent reasonable strategies to inhibit intimal hyperplasia and restenosis. Herein, we have developed a multifunctional surface for the MgZnYNd alloy with tannic acid (TA) coating, and the pH dependence of the coating deposition is also demonstrated. The phenolic hydroxyl groups on the coatings endow the modified surface with excellent antioxidant functions. We found that the coating can be recycled, and the scavenging activity hardly weakened within five cycles. Also, the TA coating has a promising strong antioxidant activity as it shows a radical scavenging activity over 80% in long term. Moreover, the TA coating possesses platelet-repellent capability. No significant inflammatory response was observed for the TA modified sample in the rat subcutaneous implantation test. Combining these performances, we envision that the vascular stent modified with TA coating can have great potential in various applications by virtue of its simplicity and effectiveness.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651111>The effect of hypoxia on hearing function</a></h2><p>This  study  was  conducted  to  determine  the  critical  partial    pressure  (pO2)  value  that  would  impair  hearing  function  by  evaluating  the  effects  of  hypoxia  on  hearing  function  in  subjects  diagnosed  with  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (CPOD).The  study  included  25  male  and    female  patients  referred  to  our  clinic  who  were  diagnosed  with  COPD,  according to spirometry and PaO2 values, and who did not show pathology upon autoscopic examination.

However, there are few reports on DP for patients with severe respiratory conditions requiring mechanical ventilation. The study aim was to demonstrate the efficacy of DP for patients with severe respiratory insufficiency after cardiothoracic surgeries.We retrospectively reviewed 10 patients who underwent DP for severe respiratory insufficiency due to postoperative diaphragmatic paralysis; eight of them required mechanical ventilation, and two needed high-flow  therapy prior to DP. The symptoms, lung function, and elevation of the diaphragm were assessed before and after DP.All patients were successfully withdrawn from mechanical ventilation after DP and discharged without the need for  therapy. The mean perioperative Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnea scale (ATS/ERS 2004) score improved in 30 days (from 4 to 1.8) and in 90 days (from 4 to 0.6) after DP. Lung dynamic compliance was also ameliorated (mean improvement: 41.9 to 60.7 mL/cmH2O). Radiography revealed improved elevation of the diaphragm (mean improvement of 1.8 intercostal spaces, range, 1-2). Mean hospital stay after DP was 65. days (range, 25-187 days). One patient who underwent DP with endostapler-only suturing required re-operation because of staple line ruptures.DP was found to be an effective form of treatment for patients with severe respiratory insufficiency after cardiothoracic surgery.2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

The XPS analysis of elements and their chemical states at the surface of MNPs and f-MNPs revealed differences in chemical bonding of atoms, content of carbon- groups, iron oxide forms, iron oxide magnetic properties, adsorbed molecules, surface coverage, and overlayer thickness, whereas the Auger parameters (derived from XPS and Auger spectra) and elastic and inelastic scattering probabilities of electrons on atoms and valence band electrons (derived from REELS spectra) indicated modification of surface charge redistribution, electronic, and optical properties. These modified properties of f-MNPs influenced their biological properties. The surfaces biocompatible for L929 cells showed various cytotoxicity for HeLa cells (10.8-.3% of cell death), the highest for MNPs functionalized with oxalic acid. The samples exhibiting the largest efficiency possessed smaller surface coverage and thickness of adsorbed molecules layers, the highest content of  and carbon- functionalizing groups, the highest ratio of lattice O and OH to C sp hybridizations on MNP surface, the highest ratio of adsorbed O and OH to C sp hybridizations on adsorbed molecule layers, the closest electronic and optical properties to FeO, and the lowest degree of admolecule polymerization. This high cytotoxicity was attributed to interaction of cells with a surface, where increased content of  groups, adsorbed O, and OH may play the role of additional adsorption and catalytic sites and a large content of adsorbed molecule layers of carboxylic groups facilitating Fenton reaction kinetics leading to cell damage.Copyright © 2019 Lesiak, Rangam, Jiricek, Gordeev, Tóth, Kövér, Mohai and Borowicz.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645117>Combined Therapy With Dobutamine and Omecamtiv Mecarbil in Pigs With Ischemic Acute Heart Failure Is Attributed to the Effect of Dobutamine.</a></h2><p>Inotropic support in ischemic acute heart failure (AHF) is controversial. We tested a therapeutic principle for AHF by combining a low dose of omecamtiv mecarbil (OM; 0.25 mg/kg bolus plus 0.25 mg/kg/h) with a low dose of dobutamine (Dobut; 1.25 µg/kg/min). In 10 pigs subjected to myocardial ischemia by left coronary microembolization, this cotreatment increased cardiac power (CP) from 0.48 ± 0.14 to 0.81 ± 0.22 W ( < .05). When the drugs were given as a monotherapy, CP increased from 0.57 ± 0.11 to 0.65 ± 0.15 W (OM; n = ; not significant) and from 0.40 ± 0.07 to 0.70 ± 0.10 W (Dobut; n = ;  < .05). Dobut counteracted OM-mediated impairments in early relaxation and diastolic shortening. In a second protocol using the same doses, we assessed cardiac efficiency in  healthy pigs by relating myocardial  consumption (MVO) to the pressure-volume area. Here, the increases in cardiac work and MVO were matched, leaving cardiac efficiency unaltered by this drug combination. Low-dose cotreatment with OM + Dobut produces an appropriate hemodynamic effect with improved CP at doses that do not affect cardiac efficiency. This outcome is mainly attributed to the inotropic effect of Dobut.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646422>Gender differences in clinical manifestations and polysomnographic findings in Chinese patients with obstructive sleep apnea.</a></h2><p>The gender differences in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are not fully understood so far, as previous studies had conflicting results. No reports have addressed the differences in OSA between Chinese men and women. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical and polysomnographic differences between Chinese men and women with OSA.This case-paired control retrospective study included 580 consecutive Chinese patients (290 males and 290 females) newly diagnosed as OSA by overnight polysomnography from the Sleep Disorders Center of Tangdu Hospital affiliated to the Fourth Military Medical University of China. Demographic, clinical, and polysomnographic data of men and women with OSA were compared. Order logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors for OSA severity.Male and female patients had similar age (57.3 ± 9.2 vs. 58.2 ± 8.9, p > 0.05) and body mass index (BMI) (25.4 ± 3.4 vs. 25. ± 3.9, p > 0.05). Women more commonly presented with insomnia (70.3% vs. 40.3%, p < 0.001), poor sleep quality (58.3% vs. 40.7%, p < 0.001), and headache on awakening (23.1% vs. 13.8%, p < 0.01) than men, while men more frequently reported habitual snoring (69.0% vs. 52.1%, p < 0.001) compared with women. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) during total sleep time and non-rapid eye movement sleep was higher in men compared with women (25.8 ± 20.4 vs. 19.3 ± 16.8; 22.0 ± 18.2 vs. 15.1 ± 15.4; p < 0.001, respectively), whereas AHI during rapid eye movement sleep was higher in women than in men (4.2 ± 3.6 vs. 3.7 ± 4.3, p < 0.01). Compared with men, women had lower sleep efficiency (75.4 ± 15.7 vs. 78.1 ± 15., p < 0.05), longer REM latency (128.9 ± 88.6 vs. 107.7 ± 72.4, p < 0.01), and greater wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO) (98.3 ± 70.2 vs. 88.0 ± 70.3, p < 0.05). No significant differences in the lowest  desaturation and  desaturation index (ODI) were observed between men and women (80.4 ± 10.8 vs. 80.8 ± 9.0; 17.0 ± 20.9 vs. 13.1 ± 16.; p > 0.05, respectively). In addition, ordinal logistic regression analysis identified neck circumference as an independent risk factor for OSA severity in male patients (OR, 1.161; 95% CI, 1.020-1.325; p < 0.05) and in female patients (OR, 1.163; 95% CI, 1.013-1.338; p < 0.05).Overall, female patients had less severe OSA when compared with male patients. The female patients more commonly reported "atypical" OSA symptoms, while male patients more frequently reported "typical" OSA symptoms. In clinical practices, physicians dealing with OSA need to take the gender disparity into consideration for more precise diagnosis and treatment, as women may be atypically symptomatic at a less severe OSA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671098>Photodynamic Therapy Combined with Antifungal Drugs against Chromoblastomycosis and the Effect of ALA-PDT on Fonsecaea In Vitro.</a></h2><p>Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic skin and subcutaneous fungal infection caused by dematiaceous fungi and is associated with low cure and high relapse rates.

Advanced liver fibrosis can evolve in cirrhosis, portal hypertension and often requires liver transplantation. At the cellular level, hepatic fibrosis involves the activation of hepatic stellate cells and their transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts. Numerous pro-fibrogenic mediators including the transforming growth factor-β1, the platelet-derived growth factor, endothelin-1, toll-like receptor 4, and reactive  species are key players in this process. Knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying hepatic fibrosis development need to be extended to find novel therapeutic strategies. Antifibrotic therapies aim to inhibit the accumulation of fibrogenic cells and/or prevent the deposition of extracellular matrix proteins. Natural products from terrestrial and marine sources, including sulfur-containing compounds, exhibit promising activities for the treatment of fibrotic pathology. Although many therapeutic interventions are effective in experimental models of liver fibrosis, their efficacy and safety in humans are largely unknown. This review aims to provide a reference collection on experimentally tested natural anti-fibrotic compounds, with particular attention on sulfur-containing molecules. Their chemical structure, sources, mode of action, molecular targets, and pharmacological activity in the treatment of liver disease will be discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669774>Behavior of ionophore antibiotics in aquatic environments in Argentina: The distribution on different scales in water courses and the role of wetlands in depuration.</a></h2><p>We studied for the first time three ionophore anticoccidial drugs: monensin (MON), lasalocid (LAS), and salinomycin (SAL) as emerging pollutants originating from animal and plant husbandry in surface waters (n = 89) in one of the most extensive hydrological basins in South América (Del Plata basin). The soluble fraction of ionophores was pretreated by solid-phase extraction and analyzed by LC-MS/MS at a limit of detection of 1.7 ng·L. A statistical approach noted the need to report parameters calculated by methods based on the number of observations and the censorship percentage over substitution methods for more precise estimations of environmental data with a high percentage of left-censored data. Water collectors adjacent to intensive-husbandry facilities, placed in direct runoffs from animal excreta, or in wastewater emissions contained median concentrations of MON and SAL approximately 70 times higher than those found in regional tributaries and main courses of  sub-basins of the pampas and mesopotamic regions, thus exhibiting a relevance to other similar agricultural pollutants widely reported as pesticides. Chemical speciation of these compounds in surface water was characterized especially for MON and SAL, where the pH and chemical  demand of the natural water body was associated with the concentration of the soluble fraction. The concentrations in abundant rivers such as the Gualeguay deliver a contribution to a natural wetland such as the Paraná-River delta, which registered only one sample with a [MON] ≤ the limit of quantification. Since wetlands possess a limited removal capability, these affluent contributions recorded strongly indicate that attention must be paid to the development of guidelines involving quality criteria for assessing the impact of ionophore antibiotics on such ecosystems.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, little is known about how blood vessels develop stereographically in the neocortex and how they control the expansion and differentiation of neural progenitors during neocortical development. We show that highly vascularized and avascular regions are strictly controlled in a spatially and temporally restricted manner and are associated with distinct cell populations. Dividing basal progenitors and oligodendrocyte precursors preferentially contact honeycomb vessels, but dividing apical progenitors are localized in avascular regions without Flt1-positive endothelial cells but directly contact with sprouting neovascular tip cells. Therefore, not all blood vessels are associated equally with neural progenitors. Furthermore, a disruption of normal vascular patterning can induce abnormalities in neural development, whereas the impaired features of neural progenitors influenced angiogenesis patterning. These results indicate that close association between the nervous and vascular systems is essential for neocortex assembly.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here, -ALA-loaded hyaluronic acid dissolving microneedles (-ALA@HAMNs) are prepared for photodynamic therapy of superficial tumors. The HAMNs can not only assist the loaded -ALA to effectively penetrate the stratum corneum but also provide -ALA with an acidic and -free environment to reduce the dimerization of -ALA molecules via Schiff-base bonds and formation of inactive pyrazine derivatives, thus maintaining its chemical structure and biological activity. The chemical stability of -ALA in HAMNs is confirmed by UV-vis spectra and mass spectra measurements. The -ALA@HAMNs display remarkable tumor elimination both in vitro and in vivo, even after storage at room temperature for nine months, making it a highly potential device for effective delivery of -ALA in cancer photodynamic therapy.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This study focused on the incorporation of carbon quantum dots doped with nitrogen as a photosensitizer into porous tungsten trioxide photoanodes (N-CQD/-WO) using a surfactant self-assembly template approach. The crystal structure, composition, and morphology of pure and N-CQD- modified porous WO photoanodes were investigated using scanning electron and transmission microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Due to their high surface area, enhanced optical absorption, and charge-carrier separation and transfer, the resulting N-CQD/-WO photoanodes exhibited a significantly enhanced photocurrent density of 1.45 mA cm at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1. G illumination in 0. M NaSO without any co-catalysts or sacrificial reagent, which was about 2.23 times greater than its corresponding pure -WO. Moreover, the  evolution onset potential of the N-CQD/-WO photoanodes exhibited a negative shift of 95 mV, signifying that both the charge-carrier separation and transfer processes were promoted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640133>Application of a Fluorescent Probe for the Online Measurement of PM-Bound Reactive  Species in Chamber and Ambient Studies.</a></h2><p>This manuscript details the application of a profluorescent nitroxide (PFN) for the online quantification of radical concentrations on particulate matter (PM) using an improved Particle Into Nitroxide Quencher (PINQ).

We partnered with the Ministry of Health to conduct a nationwide mixed-methods evaluation of private and PNFP surgical capacity in Uganda.A standardized validated facility assessment tool was utilized to assess facility infrastructure, service delivery, workforce, information management, and financing at a randomized nationally representative sample of 16 private and PNFP hospitals. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to qualitatively explore facilitating factors and barriers to surgical, obstetric and anaesthesia (SOA) care. Hospitals walk-throughs and retrospective reviews of operative logbooks were completed.Hospitals had a median of 177 beds and two operating rooms. Ten hospitals (62.%) were able to perform all Bellwether procedures (cesarean section, laparotomy and open fracture treatment). Thirty-day surgical volume averaged 102 cases per facility. While most hospitals had electricity, , running water, and necessary equipment, many reported pervasive shortages of blood, surgical consumables, and anesthetic drugs. Several themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: (1) geographic distance and limited transportation options delay reaching care; (2) workforce shortages impede the delivery of surgical care; (3) emergency and obstetric volume overwhelm the surgical system; (4) medical and non-medical costs delay seeking, reaching, and receiving care; and () there is poor coordination of care with insufficient support systems.As in Uganda's public sector, barriers to surgery in private and PNFP hospitals in Uganda are cross-cutting and closely tied to resource availability.

In this study, we demonstrated that marchantin M (Mar-M, a naturally occurring bisbibenzyl) suppressed pro-inflammatory SASP components which were elevated in chemotherapy-resistant cells. Mar-M treatment attenuated the pro-tumorigenic effects of SASP and enhanced survival in drug-resistant mouse models. No toxicity was detected on normal fibroblast cells or in animals following this treatment. Inactivation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) and nuclear factor-B (NF-B) by Mar-M significantly accounted for its suppression on the components of SASP. Furthermore, inhibition of SASP by Mar-M contributed to a synergistic effect during co-treatment with doxorubicin to lower toxicity and enhance antitumor efficacy. Thus, chemotherapy-driven pro-inflammatory activity, seen to contribute to drug-resistance, is an important target for Mar-M. By decreasing SASP, Mar-M may be a potential approach to overcome tumor malignancy.© 2019 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

The aim of this study was to determine health utilities in patients with COPD and to identify the variables with the greatest impact.This is a pooled analysis of data from 4 observational studies performed in stable COPD patients. Evaluation of patient HRQoL utilities was performed using the Spanish version of the self-administered EuroQoL  Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire. EQ-5D utilities were described and compared according to several markers of disease severity.6198 patients reported a mean (SD) EQ-5D index of 0.67 (0.26). A linear dose response relationship between EQ-5D utility and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) score, forced expiratory volume in one 1 s (% predicted), COPD hospital admissions in the previous year, self-reported daily walking time, Charlson index, body mass index, obstruction, dyspnoea and exacerbation (BODEx) index, COPD assessment test (CAT), hospital anxiety and depression scale was observed (p for trend < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, patients reporting lower utility values were those with more dyspnoea, more comorbidities, using long-term  therapy, with previous hospitalisations due to a COPD exacerbation and higher (worse) CAT score.HRQoL measures such as EQ-5D can assist clinicians to understand the impact of respiratory disease on COPD patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649499>Auranofin Mediates Mitochondrial Dysregulation and Inflammatory Cell Death in Human Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells: Implications of Retinal Neurodegenerative Diseases.</a></h2><p>Photoreceptor degeneration occurs in various retinal diseases including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, molecular mechanisms are not fully understood yet. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) forms the outer blood retinal barrier (oBRB) and supplies glucose,  and nutrients from the fenestrated choriocapillaris to photoreceptors for visual function. Therefore, RPE dysfunction leads to photoreceptor injury/death and progression of blinding eye diseases. This study aims to understand the role of the thioredoxin (Trx) and its reductase (TrxR) redox signaling in human RPE dysfunction and cell death mechanism(s) in an  system.A human RPE cell line (APRE-19) was cultured in DMEM/F12 medium and treated with auranofin (AF - 4 μM, an inhibitor of TrxR) for 4 and 24 h. Mitochondrial and lysosomal function, cellular oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activity were measured using cell assays, Western blotting, and confocal microscopy. Antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds were tested for blocking AF effects on RPE damage. Cell death mechanisms (LDH release to culture media) were determined using necroptosis, ferroptosis and pyroptosis inhibitors.  < 0.05 was considered significant in statistical analysis.Auranofin causes mitochondrial dysfunction (Δψm↓ and ATP↓), oxidative stress (HO↑) and mitophagic flux to lysosomes. Furthermore, the lysosomal enzyme (cathepsin L) activity is reduced while that of pro-inflammatory caspase-1 (NLRP3 inflammasome) is enhanced in ARPE-19. These effects of AF on ARPE-19 are inhibited by antioxidant N-acetylcysteine ( mM, NAC) and significantly by a combination of SS31 (mitochondrial antioxidant) and anti-inflammatory drugs (amlexanox and tranilast). AF also causes cell death as measured by cytosolic LDH release/leakage, which is not inhibited by either ferrostatin-1 or necrostatin-1 (ferroptosis and necroptosis inhibitors, respectively). Conversely, AF-induced LDH release is significantly reduced by MCC950 and Ac-YVAD-cmk (NLRP3 and Caspase-1 inhibitors, respectively), suggesting a pro-inflammatory cell death by pyroptosis.The Trx/TrxR redox system is critical for RPE function and viability. We previously showed that thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) is strongly induced in DR inhibiting the Trx/TrxR system and RPE dysfunction. Therefore, our results suggest that the TXNIP-Trx-TrxR redox pathway may participate in RPE dysfunction in DR and other retinal neurodegenerative diseases.Copyright © 2019 Yumnamcha, Devi and Singh.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661473>[How Methods of Molecular Biology Shape Our Understanding of the Hematopoietic System].</a></h2><p>Blood is extremely important for a multicellular organism: it connects all organs and tissues, supplies them with nutrients and , removes carbon dioxide and metabolic products, maintains homeostasis, and provides protection against infections. That is why studies on blood have always drawn a great deal of attention. In ancient times, it was believed that the soul was in the blood and that it sometimes "sank into the stomach." Initially, the study of blood was limited to morphological methods, to which physiological and cellular research were added in the twentieth century. With their help, researchers established that mature blood cells are formed from a rare population of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which are located in the bone marrow. The development of molecular biology methods and their combination with classical physiological ones allowed a breakthrough in understanding the structure of the hematopoietic system, which changed our understanding not only of hematopoiesis but also about the nature of adult stem cells. This review describes the molecular assays used in experimental hematology, and how their application has gradually been expanding our knowledge of blood formation and continues to provide new information about it.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654557>Redox status assessment in infertile patients with non-obstructive azoospermia undergoing testicular sperm extraction: a prospective study.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress (OS) is one of the most prevalent causes of sperm damage, through the toxic effects of endogenously generated hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals. Peripheral leukocytes represent a feasible model for studying the pathophysiology of OS-mediated homeostasis, which can be responsible for cell dysfunction and cell injury.To evaluate the redox status in patients with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), establishing the potential role exerted by reactive  species (ROS) in the genesis of testicular secretory injury.From May 2018 to March 2019, 39 patients were enrolled in this prospective single-center cohort study and divided in two groups. Group 1 included 19 patients with NOA, Group 2 20 normozoospermic men, partners of women with infertility tubal factor. All patients underwent serum blood tests. NOA underwent testicular sperm extraction (TeSE). ROS production (in Lymphocytes, Monocytes and Granulocytes) was assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Plasma oxidative stress was evaluated by lipid peroxidation markers (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) both assessed by fluorometric techniques.Mean lymphocyte ROS production resulted 967.0 ± 224. vs 728.0 ± 98.0 (NOA vs Controls, p<0.001), monocyte ROS resulted 2102. ± 517. vs 1253 ± 171 (p<0.001), granulocyte ROS were 2366. ± 595.4 vs 1751.0 ± 213.0 (p<0.001). Significant increases plasma lipid peroxidation markers were found in NOA patients compared to controls (2.7 ± 0.8 vs 0.37 ± 0.2 nmol/ml, p<0.001). Significant decreased TAC was evident in NOA compared to controls (13.4 ± 3.9 vs 3.0 ± 0.2 µmol/ml Trolox equivalents, p<0.001).

These pathological conditions make mitochondria of a particular interest in the regulation of cell function and death by both apoptosis and autophagy. Therefore, this work was undertaken to investigate mitochondria function, autophagy and apoptosis protein markers in the kidney from rat model of intra-abdominal obesity and renal damage induced by high sucrose diet. Mitochondria from sucrose fed (SF) kidney in the presence of pyruvate/malate generated hydrogen peroxide (HO) at a higher rate than from control (79.81 ± 4.98 vs 65.84 ± 1.95 pmol/min/mg protein). With succinate, the release of HO was significantly higher compared with pyruvate/malate and it remained higher in SF than in control mitochondria (146.4 ± 8.8 vs 106.1 ± .9 pmol/min/mg protein). However, cytochrome c release from SF kidney mitochondria was lower than from control. In addition, cardiolipin, a mitochondrial-specific phospholipid was found increased in SF mitochondria due to the enhanced amount of both cardiolipin synthase and tafazzin. Cardiolipin was also found enriched with saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids which are less susceptible to peroxidative stress involved in cytochrome c release. Furthermore, Beclin-1, LC3-B, as autophagy protein markers, and caspase 9 as apoptosis protein marker, were found decreased in SF kidney. These results suggest that the decline of autophagy protein markers and the lack of apoptosis process could be a pathological mechanism of cell dysfunction leading to the progression of renal disease in SF rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645102>Surface Engineering of Carbon Fiber Paper toward Exceptionally High-Performance and Stable Electrochemical Nitrite Sensing.</a></h2><p>In this work, we introduce our recent finding that the carbon fiber paper (CFP) treated by simple air annealing (OCFP) could be used for exceptionally high-performance electrochemical nitrite sensing. The air-annealing process endows the pristine CFP with higher defective edge/plane sites, more -containing functional groups, higher roughness, and improved wettability. The electrochemical studies show that the OCFP exhibits excellent sensing performance for nitrite, with ultra-low determination limit of 0.1 μM and detection limit of 0.07 μM, an ultra-wide linear determination range of 0.1-3838. μM, a fast current response of 1 s, and a high sensitivity of 930.4 μA mM-1 cm-2. These performance values are comparable or even superior to those for most reported noble- or transition-metal based advanced nitrite sensors. Besides, this electrode also presents satisfactory stability, reproducibility, and feasibility of nitrite sensing in food samples. As an ideal monolithic and metal-free catalyst with ultrahigh and stable detection performance, the OCFP has the high potential to be integrated into next-generation electrochemical sensing devices.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664858>E-Cigarette Use Increases Susceptibility to Bacterial Infection by Impairment of Human Neutrophil Chemotaxis, Phagocytosis and NET Formation.</a></h2><p>E-cigarettes are portrayed as safer relative to conventional tobacco. However, burgeoning evidence suggests that E-cigarettes may adversely affect host defenses. However, the precise mechanisms by which E-cigarette vapor alters innate immune cell function have not been fully elucidated. We determined the effects of E-cigarette exposure on the function and responses to infectious challenge of the most abundant innate immune cell, the neutrophil, using isolated human neutrophils and a mouse model of Gram-negative infection. Our results revealed that human neutrophils exposed to E-cigarette vapor had 4.2-fold reductions in chemotaxis towards the bacterial cell-well component f-Met-Leu-Phe (p < 0.001). F-actin polarization and membrane fluidity were also adversely affected by E-cigarette vapor exposure. E-cigarette exposed human neutrophils exhibited a 48% reduction in production of reactive  species (ROS; p < 0.001). Given the central role of ROS in neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) production, NET production was quantified and E-cigarette vapor exposure was found to reduce NETosis by 3.-fold (p < 0.01); formulations with and without nicotine containing propylene glycol exhibiting significant suppressive effects. However, non-canonical NETosis was unaffected. In addition, exposure to E-cigarette vapor lowered the rate of bacterial bioparticle phagocytosis by 47% (p < 0.05). In our physiologic mouse model of chronic E-cigarette exposure and sepsis, E-cigarette vapor inhalation led to reduced neutrophil migration into infected spaces and a higher burden of Pseudomonas. These findings provide evidence that E-cigarette use adversely impacts the innate immune system and may place E-cigarette users at higher risk for dysregulated inflammatory responses and invasive bacterial infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652695>Characterization of Oxide Film of Implantable Metals by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>The oxide film resistance (R) and capacitance (C) diagrams of implantable metals (commercially pure Ti, four types of Ti alloys, Co-28Cr-6Mo alloy, and stainless steel) were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The thin oxide film formed on each implantable metal surface was observed in situ by field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM). The Ti-15Zr-4Nb-1Ta and Ti-15Zr-4Nb-4Ta alloys had higher  concentrations in the oxide films than the Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The thickness (d) of the TiO oxide films increased from approximately 3. to 7 nm with increasing anodic polarization potential from the open-circuit potential to a maximum of 0.

C was proportional to 1/d. R tended to decrease with increasing C. R was large (maximum: 13 MΩ·cm) and C was small (minimum: 12 μF·cm·s, n = 0.94) for the Ti-15Zr-4Nb-(0 to 4)Ta alloys. The relative dielectric constant (ε) and resistivity (k) of the oxide films formed on these alloys were 136 and 2.4 × 10-1.8 × 10 (MΩ·cm), respectively.

Anaerobic processes are suitable for the treatment of wastewater high in organics to achieve pollution control and recovery of energy as methane and hydrogen, or intermediates for production of biofuels and valuable biochemicals. A distinction between protein hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation, especially for dissolved proteins, is needed to target which one is truly rate-limiting and to effectively harvest bioproducts during anaerobic conversion of these wastewaters. This study explored mesophilic anaerobic hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation of gelatine, as a model for dissolved proteins, at pH 7 and at pH .The results showed that at pH 7, protein hydrolysis (first-order rate of 0.15 h) was approximately  times faster than acidification of the hydrolysis products (first-order rate of 0.03 h), implying that not hydrolysis but acidification was the rate-limiting step in anaerobic dissolved protein degradation. This was confirmed by (temporary) accumulation of amino acids. Nineteen different amino acids were detected during the first 8 incubation hours of gelatine at neutral pH and the total chemical  demand (COD) of these 19 amino acids was up to approximately 40% of the COD of the gelatine that was added. Protein hydrolysis at pH  was 2-25 times slower than at pH 7. Shifting the initial pH from neutral to acidic conditions (pH ) inhibited protein degradation and changed the volatile fatty acids (VFA) product profile. Furthermore, the presence or absence of methanogenic activity did not affect the rates of protein hydrolysis and acidification.The findings in this study can help to set a suitable solid retention time to accomplish anaerobic degradation of protein-rich wastewaters in continuous reactor systems. For example, if the target is harvesting VFAs, methanogens can be washed-out for a shorter retention time while amino acid fermentation, instead of hydrolysis as assumed previously, will govern the design and solutions to improve the system dealing with dissolved proteins.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648545>Retropalatal Cross-Sectional Area Is Predictive of Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Patients With Syndromic Craniosynostosis.</a></h2><p>There is a high rate of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis (SCS).

The purpose of this study is to characterize the 3 dimensional (3D) upper airway in patients with SCS with and without OSA.This is a retrospective study of patients with SCS treated at Boston Children's Hospital from 2000 to 2015. Patients were divided into OSA and no-OSA groups based on polysomnography. Predictor variables included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and 3D upper airway measurements. The primary outcome variable was the presence or absence of OSA. Secondary outcome variables were apnea-hypopnea index and  saturation nadir. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were computed, and significance was set as  < .05.There were 24 patients: 16 in the OSA group and 8 in the no-OSA group. The 2 groups did not differ significantly by age, BMI, or syndromic diagnosis. The presence of OSA was associated with a smaller minimum retropalatal cross-sectional area (minRPCSA;  < .001). In a logistic regression model controlling for age, sex, and upper airway length, minRPCSA was the primary predictor of OSA ( ≤ .002). Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined minRPCSA = 55.3 mm to be the optimal diagnostic threshold for OSA, with sensitivity = 100% and specificity = 87.% ( < .001).A minRPCSA ≤55.3 mm is predictive of the presence of OSA in patients with SCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664534>Caffeine enhances the anti-tumor effect of -fluorouracil via increasing the production of reactive  species in hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>The development of drug resistance affecting the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) leads to low survival rate of HCC patients. Caffeine is reported to have a function of protecting the liver and anti-tumor activity. Therefore, caffeine may be an ideal enhancer for HCC chemotherapy regimens. Our study showed that the combination of caffeine and -FU significantly inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells in vivo and in vitro comparing with caffeine or -FU monotherapy. The CI values of caffeine (0. mM) combined with -FU (25, 50 μM) were all less than 1, confirming that the utilization of drug combination has a synergistic inhibitory effect on the proliferation of HCC cells. Meanwhile, results of Western blot and TUNEL assays demonstrated that the apoptotic level of HCC cells in the combined group was significantly increased. The protein expression level of cleaved PARP was up-regulated, while the protein level of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL was down-regulated. In addition, we found that ROS levels were increased in the 1 mM caffeine and 25 μM -FU combination group comparing with the control or single drug group. Taken together, this is the first study to demonstrate that the combination of caffeine and -FU inhibits HCC cells proliferation and promotes cellular apoptosis by regulating intracellular ROS production.

Previous studies, conducted mostly with terrestrial plant communities, found controversial evidence for this prediction. We provide here the first test for SDH for epiphytic diatoms. We studied community assembly in diatom communities of astatic ponds. These water bodies serve as a good model system for testing SDH because they exhibit stress gradients of various environmental factors. Functional diversity of diatom communities was assessed based on four traits: (1) combined trait reflecting the trade-off between stress tolerance and competitive dominance, (2) cell size, (3)  requirement and (4) N-uptake strategy. According to our results, salinity, pH and the width of the macrophyte belt appeared as significant predictors of the trait convergence/divergence patterns presumably acting through influencing the availability of carbon dioxide and turbidity. Lower trait diversity was found in turbid, more saline and more alkaline ponds and functional diversity was higher in transparent, less saline and less alkaline ponds. Overall, our results supported the stress dominance hypothesis. In habitats representing increased environmental stress, environmental filtering was the most important community assembly rule, while limiting similarity became dominant under more favourable conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664454>High Glucose Provokes Microvesicles Generation from Glomerular Podocytes via NOX4/ROS Pathway.</a></h2><p>Microvesicles (MVs) were involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Oxidative stress played a key role in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. Our aim of this study was to investigate whether high glucose could provoke microvesicles generation from podocytes and its potential mechanism. Mouse podocyte clone  (MPC-) were stimulated by high glucose. The intracellular reactive  species (ROS) of podocytes were measured by fluorescence microscopy with the probe of CM-H2DCFDA and MitoSOXTM. Antioxidants N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and alpha lipoic acid (α-LA) were used to treat podocytes after high glucose stimulation. The rate of podocyte apoptosis was evaluated with Annexin V-FITC by flow cytometry. NOX4 expression was examined and siRNA were performed to explore the mechanism of MVs generation. The quantities of MVs from MPC- cells was significantly increased (P&lt;0.05) by 4.6 times after 30 mM glucose stimulation, accompanied with double increased apoptosis. Cellular ROS generation was increased by high glucose at the peak of 48h stimulation. High glucose induced MVs was significantly decreased by 52.9% after pretreatment by antioxidant NAC. Nevertheless, Mitochondrial ROS in podocytes reached a peak at 4h stimulation, but specific antioxidant α-LA had no effect on the production of MVs (P&gt;0.05). Levels of NOX4 mRNA and protein expression were significantly upregulated by high glucose (P&lt;0.05). Podocyte-derived MVs by high glucose were eliminated by NOX4 siRNA. High glucose can provoke MVs generation from glomerular podocytes through ROS/NOX4 pathway, not from mitochondrial pathway.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663313>Mechanical power during an incremental test can be estimated from 2000-m rowing ergometer performance.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to identify the relationship between the mean power output of 2000-m rowing ergometer performance with the peak power output obtained during an incremental test, in addition to verifying the possibility of using the 2000-m mean power as an intensity associated with V̇O2max.Nineteen rowers (age 25. ± 10.6 years; V̇O2PEAK: 65.4 ± .8 mL.kg.min-1) completed an incremental test followed by a 2000-m familiarization test (day 1) and a 2000- m rowing ergometer test (day 2).

V̇O2PEAK was lower in the incremental test (4.69 ± 0.61 L.min-1) compared with the 2000-m rowing ergometer test (4.86 ± 0.63 L.min-1; P = 0.01) with a small bias ± LoA (0.16 ± 0.53 L.min-1).In conclusion, 2000-m mean power is a valid tool to estimate the PV̇O2PEAK and allow the achievement of V̇O2PEAK. Furthermore, the PV̇O2PEAK was the most important predictor of performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671298>On the path to gold: Monoanionic Au bisdithiolate complexes with antimicrobial and antitumor activities.</a></h2><p>The emergence of resistance to antimicrobial and anticancer drugs poses severe threats to public health worldwide, highlighting the need for more efficient treatments. Here, four monoanionic Au bisdithiolate complexes [Au(mnt)] (where mnt = 1,1-dicyanoethylene-2,2-dithiolate)(1), [Au(i-mnt)] (where i-mnt = 2,2-dicyanoethylene-1,1-dithiolate)(2), [Au(cdc)] (where cdc = cyanodithioimido carbonate)(3), and [Au(qdt)] (where qdt = quinoxaline-2,3-dithiolate)(4) were screened for their antimicrobial and antitumor activities. Complexes 3 and 4 showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus [minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 15.3 and 14.7 μg/mL, respectively]. Complex 3 also caused significant growth inhibition of Candida glabrata (MIC = 7.0 μg/mL). Concentrations of complexes 1-4 up to 125 μg/mL had no growth inhibition activity against Escherichia coli. The cytotoxic activity of complexes 1-4 was evaluated against the ovarian cancer cells A2780 and A2780cisR, sensitive and resistant to cisplatin, respectively. All compounds showed high cytotoxic activities against both tumoral cell lines, exhibiting IC values in the low micromolar range (0.9-. μM) upon 48 h incubation. In contrast to complex 1, the complexes 2-4 induced a dose-dependent formation of reactive  species (ROS), similar to the observed for the reference drugs auranofin and cisplatin. Opposite to 4, complexes 1-3 were able to activate caspase 3/7, suggesting the involvement of apoptosis in the mechanism of cell death. Contrasting with cisplatin, complexes 3, 4 and auranofin did not cause DNA damage. Combined, these data provide evidence that these monoanionic gold bisdithiolates, particularly complex 3, are potential lead compounds to further explore as therapeutic drugs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesise that it can better survive hypoxic conditions by altering metabolic responses through GABA (Gamma-aminobutyric acid) supplementation. In the first experiment, the hypoxia tolerance time of the fishes was evaluated under extreme anoxic conditions after feeding with GABA, which showed that GABA had improved survival time under hypoxia. To study the response of dietary GABA in hypoxia-exposed fish, the branchial HIF-1α expression levels, serum thyroid hormone levels and hepatic metabolic responses were assessed in the subsequent experiment. The treatment groups were fed for 60 days with experimental diets containing 4 levels of GABA (0.00% G, 0.50% G, 0.75% G and 1.0%G) and were subjected to 72-h hypoxia exposure (0. ± 0.02 mg L dissolved  (DO)) whereas a control group was maintained under normoxic conditions (6.0 ± 0.21 mg L DO). The five treatment groups with three replicates were C0 (0% G + normoxia), H0 (0% G + hypoxia), H0. (0.50% G + hypoxia), H0.75 (0.75% G + hypoxia) and H1.0 (1.00% G + hypoxia). The results indicated that GABA supplementation triggered downregulation of HIF 1 alpha expression. When compared with the control group, decreased thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) levels were observed in the GABA-fed hypoxic groups. However, TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) level remained unchanged in all the treatments. The LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) level in hypoxia-exposed groups was decreased by GABA supplementation. Our study demonstrated that GABA supplementation restores acute hypoxia-induced HIF-1α expression, thyroid hormone levels and LDH activities. On the other hand, it enhanced the citrate synthase (CS) activities at 0.-1.00%, which showed a sharp decline in hypoxia. Hypoxia caused increase in the serum metabolites such as glucose, lactate, cholesterol and triglycerides. However, GABA supplementation was partially effective in reducing glucose and lactate level while triglycerides and cholesterol values remained unchanged. Overall, our results suggested a potential role of GABA in suppressing metabolism during hypoxia exposure, which can increase the chances of survival of the species Cirrhinus mrigala during hypoxia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669404>Metabolomic changes of blood plasma associated with two phases of rat OIR.</a></h2><p>Although acute hyperoxia/hypoxia alternation can shift sharply physiological processes of vessel development, e.g.  induced retinopathy, very little is known of metabolic products resulted from the neovascularization disorder. In this study, the influence of abnormal  exposures on the plasma metabolomic profiles of rat models with  induced retinopathy was investigated by the gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Rat pups were divided into four groups, each with 12 individuals: (i) reared in room air and sampled at P12 (CT1); (ii) exposed to high  for  days and sampled at P12 (HO1, simulating the vaso-obeliteration process (phase I)); (iii) reared in room air and sampled at P17 (CT2); (iv) exposed to high  for  days then followed by room air for  days and sampled at P17 (HO2, simulating the neovasculization one (phase II)). Plasma samples were analyzed with GC-MS, resulted in 122 metabolite species. Distinct differences in the plasma metabolome were found between groups of CT1 vs. HO1, and HO1 vs. HO2, by using univariate and multivariate analyses. Alternating hyperoxia/hypoxia conditions induced significant changes of richness of proline, ornithine and glutamine that were important components of 'arginine and proline metabolism' pathway. These metabolites contributed largely to plasma sample classification, determined with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and were involved profoundly in the proline-dependent production of reactive  species related to the cellular redox reactions. Our results suggest proline and 'arginine and proline metabolism' pathway as the potential biomarkers for ROP diagnosis.Copyright © 2019.

Resection of the diverticulum and re-implantation of the left subclavian artery during childhood have been recommended. Because of the risk of cerebral blood flow reduction during the aberrant subclavian artery re-implantation to the common carotid artery, monitoring and prompt measures to curb blood flow reduction are required. A -month-old boy was scheduled to undergo resection surgery. During the translocation of the aberrant subclavian artery to the common carotid artery, his regional  saturation (rSO) in the left cerebrum began to decrease. We increased the end-tidal CO (EtCO), mean arterial pressure, and a fraction of inspired , successfully restoring the rSO to the initial level. No postoperative neurological complications were observed. Our experience with this patient suggests that rSO monitoring is a useful, and intervention protocol including hypercapnia, elevated mean arterial pressure, and hyperoxia to counter the decreased cerebral blood flow is effective in infant patients undergoing right-sided aortic arch surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655855>Effects of the solid lipid nanoparticle of carvacrol on rodents with lung injury from smoke inhalation.</a></h2><p>The aim of this present study was to evaluate the effect of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) containing carvacrol over the lung damage of airway smoke inhalation. The study was conducted with 30 rats subjected to smoke inhalation and divided into  groups such as, normal control, negative control,  group, SLN alone, and SLN+CARV group. The animals were sacrificed 24 h after the induction of inhalation injury further, the tissues of larynx, trachea, and lungs were collected for the histological, hematological, myeloperoxidase, and malondialdehyde analysis. The obtained results showed that treatment with CARV+SLN minimized the inhalation injury, since it reduced malondialdehyde significantly, when compared to the negative control group and minimized the histological changes which proves the absence of pulmonary emphysema and exudate in laryngeal and tracheal lumen in the CARV+SLN-treated group. Meanwhile, the presence of lesion with chronic characteristics was observed in the negative control and  groups. It is suggested that the SLN containing carvacrol minimized oxidative stress and histological damages generated from smoke inhalation in rodents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638475>Effects of chemical  demand concentration, pH and operation cycle on polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) synthesis with waste sludge.</a></h2><p>To reduce the cost of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) production and dispose amount of waste sludge simultaneously, chemical  demand (COD) concentration, pH and operation cycle were investigated to find the optimal PHA synthesis conditions with waste sludge in this study.

Samples were collected from oiled and unoiled sites in July of 2012-2016 from 12 marshes spanning three regions on the Louisiana coast. No consistent oil effect was detected for either AOA or AOB abundance or community composition. At the local scale, abundance was correlated with changes in marsh elevation, suggesting that  may be an important driver. Regional differences in abundance were best explained by salinity and soil moisture, while interannual variation may be more linked to changes in climate and Mississippi River discharge. Variation of AOA communities was correlated with organic sediment nutrients, while AOB communities were correlated with soil extractable nutrients. AOA and AOB diversity and AOB abundance decreased in 2014 in all regions, suggesting that broad-scale drivers, such as climate, may explain synchronous shifts throughout the coastal area. Our results provide insights about large-scale disturbances on nitrifying microbes in the Gulf of Mexico, and suggest that nitrogen cycling may be controlled primarily by local factors, but large-scale drivers might override these localized differences at times.

From February 2017 to May 2018, 30 patients admitted to Burn Department of our hospital with severe burns who met the criteria for inclusion and needed escharectomy and skin grafting were enrolled in this prospective randomized controlled trial. The patients were divided into group GDFM of 15 cases [14 males and 1 female, (45±14) years old] and conventional liquid management group of 15 cases [12 males and 3 females, (42±10) years old] according to the random number table. During escharectomy and skin grafting, volume of patients in group GDFM was managed according to the GDFM scheme, based on cardiac output index, stroke volume variation, stroke volume index, hemoglobin, central venous  saturation (ScvO(2)), and other parameters; volume of patients in conventional liquid management group was managed according to clinical experience and conventional liquid management scheme, based on mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, urine output, hemoglobin, and other parameters. At post operation hour (POH) 1, 6, 12, and 24, arterial and venous blood was collected from patients of the two groups to determine the levels of extravascular lung water index (ELWI), global end-diastolic volume index (GEDI), oxygenation index, ScvO(2), central venous-to-arterial blood carbon dioxide partial pressure difference (Pcv-aCO(2)), lactic acid, pH value, bicarbonate ion, and base excess routinely. Data were processed with Fisher's exact probability test,  test, analysis of variance for repeated measurement, and least significant difference test.  (1) The ELWI of patients in group GDFM was (4.3±1.1) mL/kg at POH 1, which was significantly lower than (6.±3.6) mL/kg in conventional liquid management group (=2.26, <0.05).

The GEDI levels between patients of the two groups were similar, and there was no significantly statistical difference between the two groups as a whole (treatment factor main effect =2.35, time factor main effect =0.44, interaction =0.07, >0.05). (2) The oxygenation index of patients in group GDFM was (350±78) mL/kg at POH 1, which was significantly higher than (259±109) mL/kg in conventional liquid management group (=2.63, <0.05). In conventional liquid management group, the oxygenation index of patients at POH 6 was significantly higher than that at POH 1, 12, or 24 (<0.01). The ScvO(2) levels of patients in group GDFM at POH 1, 6, and 12 were 0.516±0.105, 0.679±0.121, and 0.713±0.104, respectively, which were significantly higher than 0.382±0.194, 0.545±0.194, and 0.595±0.191 in conventional liquid management group (=2.35, 2.27, 2.10, <0.05). The ScvO(2) levels of patients in the two groups at POH 6, 12, and 24 were significantly higher than those levels at POH 1 within the same group (<0.01), and the ScvO(2) of patients in conventional liquid management group at POH 24 was significantly higher than that at POH 6 or 12 within the same group (<0.05 or <0.01). The Pcv-aCO(2) levels of patients in group GDFM were significantly lower than those in conventional liquid management group at POH 1 and 6 (=2.55, 2.71, <0.05). The Pcv-aCO(2) of patients in group GDFM at POH 12 was significantly lower than that at POH 6 or 24 within the same group (<0.05). (3) The blood lactic acid levels and pH values between patients of the two groups were similar at POH 1, 6, 12, and 24 (=0.89, 0.19, 0.26, 0.23; 1.55, 0.71, 0.77, 0.77, >0.05). In conventional liquid management group, the blood lactic acid levels of patients at POH 6, 12, and 24 were significantly lower than the level at POH 1 within the same group (<0.05), and the pH values of patients at POH 6, 12, and 24 were significantly higher than the value at POH 1 within the same group (<0.05). The levels of bicarbonate ion and base excess between patients of the two groups were similar, and there were no significantly statistical differences between the two groups as a whole (treatment factor main effect =0.06, 0.11, time factor main effect =2.07, 1.59, interaction =1.45, 0.91, >0.05).

It has certain significance in preventing and reducing pulmonary edema and pulmonary complications in patients with severe burn after operation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649844>Synergistic antitumor activity of artesunate and HDAC inhibitors through elevating heme synthesis  synergistic upregulation of ALAS1 expression.</a></h2><p>Artemisinin and its derivatives (ARTs) were reported to display heme-dependent antitumor activity. On the other hand, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) were known to be able to promote heme synthesis in erythroid cells. Nevertheless, the effect of HDACi on heme homeostasis in non-erythrocytes remains unknown. We envisioned that the combination of HDACi and artesunate (ARS) might have synergistic antitumor activity through modulating heme synthesis.  studies revealed that combination of ARS and HDACi exerted synergistic tumor inhibition by inducing cell death. Moreover, this combination exhibited more effective antitumor activity than either ARS or HDACi monotherapy in xenograft models without apparent toxicity. Importantly, mechanistic studies revealed that HDACi coordinated with ARS to increase -aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS1) expression, and subsequent heme production, leading to enhanced cytotoxicity of ARS. Notably, knocking down  significantly blunted the synergistic effect of ARS and HDACi on tumor inhibition, indicating a critical role of ALAS1 upregulation in mediating ARS cytotoxicity. Collectively, our study revealed the mechanism of synergistic antitumor action of ARS and HDACi. This finding indicates that modulation of heme synthesis pathway by the combination based on ARTs and other heme synthesis modulators represents a promising therapeutic approach to solid tumors.© 2019 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

The athlete retired from running at 32 years old (best marathon performance: 2:13:59) for a 16-year period after his participation at the Olympics.Heart rate (HR),  uptake (VO2), ventilation (VE), blood lactate concentration (La), step frequency (SF) and running economy (RE) were measured during a treadmill-running test.His HRmax, VEmax, Lamax, VO2max were 165 beats.min, 115 l.min, .7 mmol.l and 65.4 ml.kg.min, respectively. At his marathon pace, his RE was 210 ml.kg.km with a SF of 199±0.55 s.min and his  uptake corresponded to 91% of his VO2max.This study shows that despite a 16-year break in training, this 59-year old former Olympian marathoner has managed to limit the age-related decline in performance to ~% per decade.

To determine whether a single dose of Zynamite administered 1 h before exercise increases repeated-sprint performance, 20 men and 20 women who were physically active were randomly assigned to three treatments following a double-blind cross-over counterbalanced design. Treatment A, 140 mg of Zynamite, 140 mg of quercetin, 147.7 mg of maltodextrin, and 420 mg of sunflower lecithin; Treatment B, 140 mg of Zynamite, 140 mg of quercetin, and 2126 mg of maltodextrin and Treatment C, 2548 mg of maltodextrin (placebo). Subjects performed three Wingate tests interspaced by 4 min and a final 15 s sprint after ischemia. Treatments A and B improved peak power output during the first three Wingates by 2.8% and 3.8%, respectively (treatment x sprint interaction,  = 0.01). Vastus Lateralis oxygenation (NIRS) was reduced, indicating higher O extraction (treatment × sprint interaction,  = 0.01). Improved O extraction was observed in the sprints after ischemia ( = 0.008; placebo vs. mean of treatments A and B). Blood lactate concentration was .9% lower after the ingestion of Zynamite® with quercetin in men (treatment by sex interaction,  = 0.049). There was a higher Vastus Lateralis O extraction during 60 s ischemia with polyphenols (treatment effect,  = 0.03), due to the greater muscle VO in men ( = 0.001). In conclusion, a single dose of Zynamite combined with quercetin one hour before exercise improves repeated-sprint performance and muscle O extraction and mitochondrial O consumption during ischemia.

They can be acquired from medical waste such as adipose and umbilical cord tissues, are influenced by culturing conditions, and exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-fibrotic, and angiogenic effects. We analyzed the multi-directional effects of MSCs cultured under hypoxic conditions and their underlying mechanisms in the treatment of liver cirrhosis in a mouse model.Human bone marrow-derived MSCs cultured under hypoxic (% O; hypoMSCs) and normoxic (21% O; norMSCs) conditions were compared by cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) with or without serum from liver cirrhosis patients. The therapeutic effects of MSCs, including serum liver enzyme induction, fibrosis regression, and hepatic oxidative stress, were evaluated by injecting 1 × 10, 2 × 10, or 4 × 10 MSCs/mouse into the tail veins of mice with carbon tetrachloride (CCl)-induced liver cirrhosis. Intravital imaging was performed with a two-photon excitation microscope to confirm the various MSC migration paths to the liver.CAGE analysis revealed that the RNA expression levels of prostaglandin E synthase () and miR210 were significantly higher in hypoMSCs than in norMSCs.  analysis revealed that both hypoMSCs and norMSCs reduced serum alanine aminotransferase, oxidative stress, and fibrosis compared to that in control mice in a dose-dependent manner. However, hypoMSCs had stronger therapeutic effects than norMSCs. We confirmed this observation by an  study in which hypoMSCs changed macrophage polarity to an anti-inflammatory phenotype via prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) stimulation. In addition, miR210 reduced the rate of hepatocyte apoptosis. Intravital imaging after MSC administration showed that both cell types were primarily trapped in the lungs. Relatively a few hypoMSCs and norMSCs migrated to the liver. There were no significant differences in their distributions.The therapeutic effect of hypoMSCs was mediated by PGE2 and miR210 production and was greater than that of norMSCs. Therefore, MSCs can be manipulated to improve their therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of liver cirrhosis and could potentially serve in effective cell therapy. MSCs produce several factors with multidirectional effects and function as "conducting cells" in liver cirrhosis.© 2019 The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine.

Furthermore, the mechanisms by which IRI causes EG damage have not been fully elucidated. The aims of this study were to determine if hypoxia alone or hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) caused greater damage to the glycocalyx, and if this damage was mediated by reactive  species (ROS) and Ca signaling.Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured to confluence and exposed to either normoxia (30 minutes), hypoxia (2% O2 for 30 minutes), or H/R (30 minutes hypoxia followed by 30 minutes normoxia). Some cells were pretreated with ROS scavengers TEMPOL, MitoTEMPOL, Febuxostat, or Apocynin, or with the Ca chelator BAPTA or Ca channel blockers 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, A967079, Pyr3, or ML204. Intracellular ROS was quantified for all groups. Endothelial glycocalyx was measured using fluorescently tagged wheat germ agglutinin and imaged with fluorescence microscopy.Glycocalyx thickness was decreased in both hypoxia and H/R groups, with the decrease being greater in the H/R group. TEMPOL, MitoTEMPOL, BAPTA, and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate prevented loss of glycocalyx in H/R. The ROS levels were likewise elevated compared with normoxia in both groups, but were increased in the H/R group compared with hypoxia alone. BAPTA did not prevent ROS production in either group.In our cellular model for shock, we demonstrate that although hypoxia alone is sufficient to produce glycocalyx loss, H/R causes a greater decrease in glycocalyx thickness. Under both conditions damage is dependent on ROS and Ca signaling. Notably, we found that ROS are generated upstream of Ca, but that ROS-mediated damage to the glycocalyx is dependent on Ca.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649272>A general synthesis approach for amorphous noble metal nanosheets.</a></h2><p>Noble metal nanomaterials have been widely used as catalysts.

To investigate this question, aerobic and microaerobic bacterial enrichments amended with a diesel fuel/crude oil mixture were established and analysed. The representative aerobic enrichment community was dominated by Gammaproteobacteria (64.%) with high an abundance of Betaproteobacteriales (36.%), followed by Alphaproteobacteria (8.7%), Actinobacteria (.6%), and Candidatus Saccharibacteria (4.%). The most abundant alkane monooxygenase (alkB) genotypes in this enrichment could be linked to members of the genus Rhodococcus and to a novel Gammaproteobacterium, for which we generated a high-quality draft genome using genome-resolved metagenomics of the enrichment culture. Contrarily, in the microaerobic enrichment, Gammaproteobacteria (99%) overwhelmingly dominated the microbial community with a high abundance of the genera Acinetobacter (66.3%), Pseudomonas (11%) and Acidovorax (11%). Under microaerobic conditions, the vast majority of alkB gene sequences could be linked to Pseudomonas veronii.

However, studies of PI5P function are limited by the lack of scalable techniques to quantify its level from cells and tissues in multicellular organisms. Currently, PI5P measurement requires the use of radionuclide labelling approaches that are not easily applicable in tissues or in vivo samples. In the present study, we describe a simple and reliable, non-radioactive mass assay to measure total PI5P levels from cells and tissues of Drosophila, a genetically tractable multicellular model. We use heavy -labelled ATP (18O-ATP) to label PI5P from tissue extracts while converting it into PI(4,)P2 using an in vitro kinase reaction. The product of this reaction can be selectively detected and quantified with high sensitivity using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) platform. Further, using this method, we capture and quantify the unique acyl chain composition of PI5P from Drosophila cells and tissues. Finally, we demonstrate the use of this technique to quantify elevations in PI5P levels, from Drosophila larval tissues and cultured cells depleted of phosphatidylinositol  phosphate 4-kinase (PIP4K), that metabolizes PI5P into PI(4,)P2 thus regulating its levels. Thus, we demonstrate the potential of our method to quantify PI5P levels with high sensitivity from cells and tissues of multicellular organisms thus accelerating understanding of PI5P functions in vivo.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654960>Excess N and denitrification in hyporheic porewaters and groundwaters of the San Joaquin River, California.</a></h2><p>The San Joaquin River (SJR) in California is purported to receive high nitrate loadings from surrounding agricultural lands through both surface and groundwater inputs. To investigate the potential removal of nitrate (NO) from surface and ground water sources, the spatial variations in dinitrogen (N) gas concentrations and direct measurements of sediment denitrification potential (DNP), with amended NO and carbon (C) treatments, were investigated in the summer along a 95-km reach of the San Joaquin River. Excess N in hyporheic porewaters ranged from <0.1 to 8.65 mg L and was significantly higher in porewaters from the 1.3 m (ground water source) versus 0.3 m (mixed surface and ground water) depths. In deep groundwater wells (3-7 m), median excess N concentration was .39 mg L (range = <0.1-14.6 mg L). Excess N concentrations were inversely correlated with dissolved  and NO concentrations suggesting denitrification as an important process in the dominantly anaerobic sediments. Hyporheic porewater NO concentrations exceeded the detection limit of 0.01 mg L in only 20% of the hyporheic porewaters, in spite of high NO concentrations measured in both surface waters (mean = 2.25 mg N L) and surrounding groundwaters. Sediment DNP rates averaged 253 and 297 μg N kg hr for NO amended, and NO + C amended sediments, respectively, supporting the prevalence of denitrification in hyporheic sediments. Our results indicate that the hyporheic/riparian zones act as an anoxic barrier to nitrate transport from regional groundwater and as a location to remove NO from surface waters exchanging with the hyporheic zone.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, rational design of electrocatalysts with suitably high efficiencies and stabilities in strongly acidic electrolytes remains a significant challenge. Here, we show the first demonstration of sub-10 nm, composition-tunable Rh-Ir alloy nanoparticles (NPs) prepared using a scalable microwave-assisted method as superior acidic OER catalysts. The OER activities showed a volcano-shaped dependence on Ir composition, with Ir-rich NPs (Ir ≥51%) achieving better OER performance than pure Ir NPs, as reflected by lower overpotentials and higher mass activities. Most significantly, Rh22Ir78 NPs achieved a maximum mass activity of 1.17 A·mg-1Ir at a 300 mV overpotential in 0. M H2SO4, which corresponds to a 3-fold enhancement relative to pure Ir NPs, making it one of the most active reported OER catalysts under acidic conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that owing to the synergy of ensemble and electronic effects by alloying a small amount of Rh with Ir, the binding energy difference of the O and OOH intermediates is reduced, leading to faster kinetics and enhanced OER activity. Furthermore, Rh-Ir alloy NPs demonstrated excellent durability in strongly acidic electrolyte. This work not only provides fundamental understandings relating to composition-electrochemical performance relationships but also opens new avenues for the rational design of highly efficient OER electrocatalysts for applications in acidic media.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672966>Coulomb-driven single defect engineering for scalable qubits and spin sensors in diamond.</a></h2><p>Qubits based on colour centres in diamond became a prominent system for solid-state quantum information processing and sensing. But the deterministic creation of qubits and the control of their environment are still critical issues, preventing the development of a room-temperature quantum computer. We report on the high creation yield of NV centres of 75% (a tenfold enhancement) by charge-assisted defect engineering, together with an improvement of their spin coherence. The method strongly favours the formation and negative charge state of the NV centres with respect to intrinsic diamond, while it hinders the formation of competing and perturbing defects such as di-vacancies or NVH complexes. We evidence spectrally the charge state tuning of the implantation-induced vacancies from V to V, key element of this Coulomb-driven engineering. The generality of the method is demonstrated using several donors (phosphorous,  and sulphur) and applying it to other centres (SnV and MgV) in diamond.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673891>Benefits and risks of low molecular weight heparin in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.</a></h2><p>Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is an anticoagulant that has recently been found benefit in the acute exacerbation stage of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). But its efficacy is controversial. The objective of this paper is to compare the harm/benefit of LMWH combined with conventional therapy versus single conventional therapy in the acute exacerbation stage of COPD.PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CNKI, and Clinical Trials.gov were searched from inception until March 2019. Randomized control trials were included if they reported the use of LMWH for the treatment of COPD. Continuous variable data were reported as mean difference (MD), risk difference (RD), and Peto odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% CIs.Twelve RCTs (N = 1086 subjects) were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled results exhibited that LMWH treatment significantly improved the levels of arterial partial pressure of  (PaO) (MD = 4.58, 95% CI: 1.78-7.39, P = 0.001), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (MD = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.09-0.29, P = 0.0002), and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) (MD = 10.44, 95% CI: .40-15.48, P < 0.0001), and significantly reduced the risk of thrombosis (RD, - 0.03; 95% CI, - 0.07 to 0.00; P = 0.05). There was a marginally but nonsignificant improvement in PaCO levels vs non-LMWH treatment. Moreover, pooled results exhibited that LMWH may increase the risk of hemorrhage. Subgroup analyses exhibited that LMWH treatment only was associated with a significantly increased risk of minor bleeding but not major hemorrhage.When compared with single conventional therapy, addition of LMWH to conventional therapy may provide more clinical benefits in the acute exacerbation stage of COPD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671658>Fighting Hypoxia to Improve PDT.</a></h2><p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has drawn great interest in recent years mainly due to its low side effects and few drug resistances. Nevertheless, one of the issues of PDT is the need for  to induce a photodynamic effect. Tumours often have low  concentrations, related to the abnormal structure of the microvessels leading to an ineffective blood distribution. Moreover, PDT consumes O. In order to improve the oxygenation of tumour or decrease hypoxia, different strategies are developed and are described in this review: 1) The use of O vehicle; 2) the modification of the tumour microenvironment (TME); 3) combining other therapies with PDT; 4) hypoxia-independent PDT; ) hypoxia-dependent PDT and 6) fractional PDT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662181>Effect of Treatment of Central Sleep Apnea/Cheyne-Stokes Respiration on Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction in Heart Failure: A Network Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>Patients who have experienced heart failure with central sleep apnea/Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSA/CSR) have an impaired prognosis. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and adaptive servoventilation (ASV) as well as nocturnal  (O₂) are proposed treatment modalities of CSA/CSR. The goal of the study is to assess whether and how different treatments of CSA/CSR affect cardiac function.Databases were searched up to December 2017 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effect of any combination of CPAP, ASV, O₂ or an inactive control on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with heart failure and CSA/CSR. A systematic review and network meta-analysis using multivariate random-effects meta-regression were performed.Twenty-four RCTs (1,289 patients) were included in the systematic review and data of 16 RCTs (951 patients; apnea-hypopnea-index 38 ± 3/h, LVEF 29 ± 3%) could be pooled in a network meta-analysis. Compared to an inactive control, both CPAP and ASV significantly improved LVEF by 4.4% (95% confidence interval 0.3-8.%, P = 0.036) and 3.8% (95% confidence interval 0.6-7.0%, P = 0.025), respectively, whereas O₂ had no effect on LVEF (P = 0.35). There was no difference in treatment effects on LVEF between CPAP and ASV (P = 0.76). The treatment effect of positive pressure ventilation was larger when baseline LVEF was lower in systolic heart failure.CPAP and ASV are effective in improving LVEF in patients with heart failure and CSA/CSR to a clinically relevant amount, whereas nocturnal O₂ is not. There is no difference between CPAP and ASV in the comparative beneficial effect on cardiac function.© 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649338>Predicting intestinal recovery after necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants.</a></h2><p>Intestinal recovery after NEC is difficult to predict in individuals. We evaluated whether several biomarkers predict intestinal recovery after NEC in preterm infants.We measured intestinal tissue  saturation (rSO) and collected urinary intestinal-fatty binding protein (I-FABP) levels 0-24 h and 24-48 h after NEC onset, and before and after the first re-feed. We assessed intestinal recovery in two ways: time to full enteral feeding (FEFt; below or equal/above group's median) and development of post-NEC complications (recurrent NEC/post-NEC stricture). We determined whether the rSO, its range, and I-FABP differed between groups.We included 27 preterm infants who survived NEC (Bell's stage ≥ 2). Median FEFt was 14 [IQR: 12-23] days. Biomarkers only predicted intestinal recovery after the first re-feed. Mean rSO ≥ 53% combined with mean rSO ≥ 50% predicted FEFt < 14 days with OR 16.7 (CI: 2.3-122.2). The rSO was smaller (33% vs. 51%, p < 0.01) and I-FABP was higher (92.4 vs. 25. ng/mL, p = 0.03) in case of post-NEC stricture, but not different in case of recurrent NEC, compared with infants without complications.The rSO, its range, and I-FABP after the first re-feed after NEC predicted intestinal recovery.

RAW264.7 macrophages were polarized to M1/M2 subtypes then administered with different concentrations of Kin. The polarization transitions were evaluated with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), confocal observation and flow cytometry analysis. The mechanism of Kin repolarizing M1 macrophages was evaluated by Western blot. Further, macrophage conditioned medium (CM) and IL-1 were administered to chondrocytes. Micro-CT scanning and histological observations were conducted  on anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) mice with or without Kin treatment. We found that Kin repolarized M1 macrophages to the M2 phenotype. Mechanistically, Kin inhibited the phosphorylation of IB, which further reduced the downstream phosphorylation of P65 in nuclear factor-B (NF-B) signaling. Moreover, Kin inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling molecules p-JNK, p-ERK and p-P38. Additionally, Kin attenuated macrophage CM and IL-1-induced chondrocyte damage. , Kin reduced the infiltration of M1 macrophages, promoted M2 macrophages in the synovium, inhibited subchondral bone destruction and reduced articular cartilage damage induced by ACLT. All the results indicated that Kin is an effective therapeutic candidate for OA treatment.© 2019 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

Also, the diffusion of silicone oil molecules as macromolecules with different molecular weights into EG pores is studied. Various EG samples were prepared by the sudden heating of graphite intercalated compound (GIC) with varying particle size of 35, 50, 80 and 200 meshes in an electrical furnace at temperatures of 700, 800 and 900 °C. The EGs were characterized by FTIR to evaluate the presence of functional groups. It was found that the exfoliation process has not significantly introduced  functional groups such as epoxy and carboxyl groups to the EG structure. Therefore the chemical structure of the EG is very close to pristine graphite. The mercury porosimetry results showed a broad range of total pore area from  to 31 m/g for the EGs. The particle size of GIC and exfoliation temperature showed strong effects on the pore size of EG. The mercury intrusion porosimetry and nitrogen adsorption isotherms revealed that μm-pores are dominant as compared with nm-pores in all EG samples. The diffusion of silicone oils as macromolecular guests with three different viscosities was experimentally studied to analyze the diffusion facts of EG as the host. It was observed that as the exfoliation temperature decreases, the sorption capacity decreases; and EG samples prepared from the GICs with smaller particle size have lower sorption capacity. Sorption experiments also showed that the whole pore volume of EG is not filled with silicone oil leading to this fact that EG includes relatively closed pores. A new model was suggested for the sorption capacity of EG as a function of the pore area of EG and the square root of molecular weight of silicone oil.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647665>Low Temperature Oxidation of Ethane to Oxygenates by  over Iridium-Cluster Catalysts.</a></h2><p>Direct selective oxidation of light alkanes, such as ethane, into value-added chemical products under mild reaction conditions remains a challenge in both industry and academia.

Twelve (6 females and 6 males) amateur athletes familiarized with all experimental procedures had their anthropometric data obtained on day 1. On days 2 and 3 either 8 mg of TER or a placebo (PLA) was administered orally (double-blind manner) to participants who had rested for 3 h prior to aerobic exercise performance 20 m multistage fitness test (MSFT)]. This test was used to predict maximal  uptake (VO) and velocity at which VO occurs (vVO). The Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE), cardiovascular variables [heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP)] and blood glucose concentration [BGC] were obtained 15 min pre- and immediately post-MSFT. Significant mean group differences were reported between PLA and TER groups (p < 0.05), respectively, in the RPE (15.6 ± 1.2 vs. 17.3 ± 1. a.u.), maximum heart rate (HR: 191.2 ± 7.1 vs. 197.2 ± 8.6 bpm) and BGC (118.4 ± 18.3 vs. 141.2 ± 15.8 mg/dL) post-MSFT. The main effect of gender (male vs. female) in TER and PLA groups (p< 0.05) was observed, with higher estimated VO, vVO, HR and a lower mean HR pre-test in male than female athletes.

The risk is mainly -determined by the altitude and rate of ascent and the symptoms vary. Most common are symptoms of acute mountain illness (AMS) but more dangerous high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) and high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) can also develop. The causes of AMS, HACE and HAPE are lack of  and insufficient acclimatization, but the presenting form is determined by the responses of the body to the lack of . The most common symptoms of AMS include headache, fatique and nausea, but insomnia and nausea are also common. The most common symptoms of HAPE are breathlessness and lassitude whereas the cardinal sign of HACE is ataxia, but confusion and loss of consciousness can also develop.

High altitude (HA) may be involved in IOP, but the reported results were conflicting. Ascent to HA directly by plane from low altitude regions is an acute, effortless exposure. However, the effects of such exposure to different altitudes on IOP have rarely been reported.To investigate changes in IOP after rapid effortless exposure to HA in stages and compare it with systemic parameters.Fifty-eight healthy subjects (116 eyes) were divided into three groups: 17 low-altitude (LA) residents [44 m above sea level (ASL)], 22 HA residents (2261 m ASL) and 19 very HA (VHA) residents (3750 m ASL). The LA group flew to HA first. Three days later, they flew with the HA group to VHA where both groups stayed for 2 d. Then, the LA group flew back to HA and stayed for 1 d before flying back to 44 m. IOP,  saturation (SpO) and pulse rate were measured. The linear mixed model was used to compare repeated measurements.IOP in the LA group significantly decreased from 18.41 ± 2.40 mmHg at 44 m to 13.60 ± 3.68 mmHg at 2261 m ASL ( < 0.001), and then to 11.85 ± 2.48 mmHg at 3750 m ASL ( = 0.036 compared to IOP at 2261 m ASL) and partially recovered to 13.47 ± 2.57 mmHg upon return to 44 m. IOP in the LA group at HA and VHA was comparable to that in the local residents (12.2 ± 2.4 mmHg for HA,11. ± 1.8 mmHg for VHA). IOP was positively associated with SpO.IOP in the LA group gradually reduced as altitude elevated in stages and became comparable to IOP in local residents. Hypoxia may be associated with IOP, which deserves further study.©The Author(s) 2019. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

Here, we investigated the therapeutic effects of AB38b, a novel synthetic α, β-unsaturated ketone compound, on the oxidative stress (OS) and ECM accumulation in type 2 diabetes mice, and tried to clarify the mechanisms underlying the effects in high glucose (HG, 30 mM)-treated mouse glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs). Type 2 diabetes model was established in mice with high-fat diet feeding combined with streptozocin intraperitoneal administration. The diabetic mice were then treated with AB38b (10, 20, 40 mg· kg· d, ig) or a positive control drug resveratrol (40 mg· kg· d, ig) for 8 weeks. We showed that administration of AB38b or resveratrol prevented the increases in malondialdehyde level, lactate dehydrogenase release, and laminin and type IV collagen deposition in the diabetic kidney. Simultaneously, AB38b or resveratrol markedly lowered the level of Keap1, accompanied by evident activation of Nrf2 signaling in the diabetic kidney. The underlying mechanisms of antioxidant effect of AB38b were explored in HG-treated mouse GMCs. AB38b (2.-10 μM) or resveratrol (10 μM) significantly alleviated OS and ECM accumulation in HG-treated GMCs. Furthermore, AB38b or resveratrol treatment effectively activated Nrf2 signaling by inhibiting Keap1 expression without affecting the interaction between Keap1 and Nrf2. Besides, AB38b treatment effectively suppressed the ubiquitination of Nrf2. Taken together, this study demonstrates that AB38b ameliorates experimental DN through antioxidation and modulation of Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645107>Melatonin and Nicotinamide Mononucleotide Attenuate Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury via Modulation of Mitochondrial Function and Hemodynamic Parameters in Aged Rats.</a></h2><p>Ischemic heart diseases are the major reasons for disability and mortality in elderly individuals. In this study, we tried to examine the combined effects of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) preconditioning and melatonin postconditioning on cardioprotection and mitochondrial function in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury of aged male rats. Sixty aged Wistar rats were randomly allocated to  groups, including sham, control, NMN-receiving, melatonin-receiving, and combined therapy (NMN+melatonin). Isolated hearts were mounted on Langendorff apparatus and then underwent 30-minue ligation of left anterior descending coronary artery to induce regional ischemic insult, followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (100 mg/kg/d intraperitoneally) was administered for every other day for 28 days before I/R. Melatonin added to perfusion solution,  minutes prior to the reperfusion up to 15 minutes early reperfusion. Myocardial hemodynamic and infarct size (IS) were measured, and the left ventricles samples were obtained to evaluate cardiac mitochondrial function and oxidative stress markers. Melatonin postconditioning and NMN had significant cardioprotective effects in aged rats; they could improve hemodynamic parameters and reduce IS and lactate dehydrogenase release compared to those of control group. Moreover, pretreatment with NMN increased the cardioprotection by melatonin. All treatments reduced oxidative stress and mitochondrial reactive  species (ROS) levels and improved mitochondrial membrane potential and restored NAD/NADH ratio. The effects of combined therapy on reduction of mitochondrial ROS and oxidative status and improvement of mitochondrial membrane potential were greater than those of alone treatments. Combination of melatonin and NMN can be a promising strategy to attenuate myocardial I/R damages in aged hearts. Restoration of mitochondrial function may substantially contribute to this cardioprotection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651199>Cognitive Effects of Repeated Acute Exposure to Very High Altitude Among Altitude-Experienced Workers at 5050 m.</a></h2><p>Pun, Matiram, Veronica Guadagni, Lauren L.

We investigated altitude effects on different cognitive domains among perennial shift-workers at the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Observatory (5050 m), Chile.  Twenty healthy male workers were recruited and assigned to either a moderate-altitude first ( group, : 2900 m and : 5050 m) or to a high-altitude first ( group, : 5050 m and : 2900 m).  was conducted at the beginning and  at the end of the shift-work week. Processing speed (RTI, reaction time), attention (AST, attention-switching task, and RVP, rapid visual processing), and executive function (OTS, One Touch Stockings of Cambridge) were assessed.  Of the three cognitive domains assessed, only processing speed showed altitude-at-test group interaction (RTI median five choice reaction time:  = 6.980, [Formula: see text] = 0.291,  = 0.017). With acclimatization, there was a decrease in AST reaction latency mean ( = -2.155,  1.086,  = 0.046), an increase in RVP accuracy ( = 2.733,  1.398,  = 0.014), and a decrease in OTS mean latency first choice ( = -2.375,  1.211,  = 0.03). Decreased variability in cognitive function was observed in AST reaction latency standard deviation ( = -2.524,  1.282,  = 0.022) and in RVP response latency standard deviation ( = -2.35,  1.177,  = 0.03) with acclimatization. At 5050 m of elevation, SpO was positively correlated with executive function in the  group (OTS problems solved on first choice:  = 0.839,  = 0.018) and negatively correlated with executive function latency standard deviations in the  group (OTS latency to first choice standard deviation:  = -0.618,  = 0.032).  Our findings highlight the importance of acclimatization and improvement of blood  level, even among high altitude-experienced workers, to optimize performance of cognitively demanding work and reduce high altitude-associated health risks.</p></html>
