Male Wistar rats received a hypercholesterolemic diet (HD), HD + atorvastatin (HD+ATV), HD + ezetimibe (HD+EZT), HD +  (HD+DG), HD+ATV+EZT, or HD+ATV+DG for 40 days. We also included a control normal group (ND). The labelled compounds were administered on day 30. The animals were placed in metabolic cages for daily feces collection. At day 40 the rats were sacrificed. Lipid extracts from blood, liver, spinal cord, testicles, kidneys, epididymis, intestine, and feces were analyzed for radioactivity. Cholesterol activity was the highest in the liver in HD rats. DG diminished one half of this activity in HD+DG and HD+ATV+DG groups in comparison with the HD group. HD+ATV rats showed four to almost ten-fold cholesterol activity in the spinal cord compared with the ND or HD rats. Fecal elimination of neutral steroids was approximately two-fold higher in the HD+DG and HD+ATV+DG groups. Taurocholic acid activity was four to ten-fold higher in HD+DG intestine as compared to the other experimental groups. Taurocholic activity in the liver of HD and HD+DG groups was two and a half higher than in ND. Our results show that the combination of DG and ATV induced the highest cholesterol reduction in the liver and other tissues.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27496582>Effect of fenugreek on hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidemia in  and prediabetes: A meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Fenugreek is a widely used herb for the treatment of  (DM) but the effects in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the overall effects of fenugreek on hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidemia in  and prediabetes.PubMed, EMBASE, web of science, Chinese Biomedical Literature database (CBM), the Cochrane library, China Doctor Dissertations Full-text Database (CDFD), Wan Fang medical database, China Proceedings of Conference Full-text Database (CPCD), China national knowledge internet (CNKI) and China Master's Theses Full-text Database (CMFD) were searched to find the available literatures. RCTs with regard to the efficacy and safety of fenugreek on prediabetes or DM were included. The data of fasting blood glucose (FBG), postprandial 2h blood glucose (2hBG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) were extracted to appraise the net change with fixed or randomized effect model.A total of 10 articles (12 studies) were included in the analysis. Pooled results showed fenugreek significantly decreased the levels of FBG (MD -0.84mmol/L; 95% CI -1.38 to -0.31; p=0.002), 2hBG (MD -1.30mmol/L; 95% CI -1.78 to -0.83; p<0.0001), HbA1c (MD -1.16; 95% CI -1.23 to -1.09; p<0.00001) and TC (MD -0.30mmol/L; 95% CI-0.56 to -0.03; p=0.03). In spite of the reductive trends in the TG or LDL-c levels and incremental trends of HDL-c, these results were not statistically significant or need further verification for fenugreek in the treatment of DM and prediabetes. Some studies were of low quality. No liver and kidney toxicity were found in all included studies, and the main side effects were gastrointestinal discomfort.The results suggest fenugreek has the hypoglycaemic and TC-lowering efficacy; however, the effects on TG, LDL-c and HDL-c need further confirmations.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The present study aimed to examine whether dioscin exerts anti-atherosclerotic activity and inhibits foam cell formation. A high-fat induced AS model and ox-LDL treated macrophages were established and received treatment of dioscin. Anti-atherosclerotic activity in vivo was assessed by atherosclerotic lesions size and aortic lipid contents. Macrophage formed foam cells were positively identified by oil red o staining. Moreover, the expression of LOX-1 and NF-κB in aorta tissue and macrophages was examined by western blotting assay. Our results showed that dioscin not only reduced the levels of plasma lipid, TNF-a, IL-1β and IL-6, but also inhibited atherosclerotic development in AS rats, as evidenced by decreased atherosclerotic lesions size and aortic lipid level. In vitro study revealed dioscin directly reduced foam cell formation, decreased intracellular cholesterol accumulation and lowered TNF-a, IL-1β and IL-6 secretion in ox-LDL treated macrophages. Interestingly, further work found dioscin significantly reduced expression of LOX-1 and NF-κB in the aortic tissue and ox-LDL treated macrophages. In summary, our study was the first to confirm anti-atherosclerotic activity of dioscin in vivo and vitro. Moreover, the other important finding is dioscin mediated ox-LDL/LOX-1/NF-κB regulated contributions to the attenuate macrophage ox-LDL uptake and AS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30179466>Effects of Sanyaku and Its Constituent  on the Fasted and Postprandial Hypertriacylglycerolemia in High-Fat-Diet-Fed KK- A  Mice.</a></h1><p>In this study, we examined the fasted and postprandial triacylglycerol (TG) levels in KK- A  mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a HFD containing either 500 ppm (0.05%) of  or 500 ppm (0.05%) of -containing Chinese yam sanyaku. Oral fat tolerance tests revealed that, not only in the fasting state but also after loading of lipid emulsion, plasma levels of TG were significantly reduced in sanyaku- and - fed mice. Levels of fat oxidation, especially in the dark phase (from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.), were increased in the sanyaku and  groups. Moreover mRNA levels of lipoprotein lipase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, coactivator 1α were moderately upregulated in the liver of sanyaku- and -ingested mice. These results suggest that consecutive ingestion of  or -containing sanyaku at the dose achievable in a human diet potentially ameliorates fasted and postprandial hypertriacylglycerolemia, which could be associated with the improvement of TG metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26743227>Antidiabetic effect of total saponins from Polygonatum kingianum in streptozotocin-induced daibetic rats.</a></h1><p>Polygonatum kingianum has been used in the prevention and treatment of diabetes, hyperlipidemia and related metabolic syndrome in Asian counties for centuries. In this study, the blood glucose regulation activity and mechanism of total saponins from P. kingianum (TSPK) were investigated in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats in this research.TSPK (0.025g/kg and 0.1mg/kg) was administrated by gavage to STZ-induced diabetic rats for 8 weeks. Changes of body weight, food intakes, blood glucose, serum insulin and lipid indexes were observed. Genome-wide expression profiling was applied to explore the gene expression alternation after treated with TSPK. Expressions of adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), the relative transcript level of glucose kinase and glucose-6-phosphatase (GK/G6P) in the liver were investigated. Meanwhile, contents of AMPK, and glucose transporter subtype-4 (GLUT4) in skeletal muscle, and peroxysome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-γ) in adipose tissue were investigated.TSPK could effectively alleviate hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in diabetic rats. Genome-wide expression profiling showed that TSPK up-regulated the expression of GLUT4 while down-regulated the expression of G6P in insulin signal pathway. In the liver, the expression of AMPK and GK are increased. Further more, TSPK promoted the expressions of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle, and PPAR-γ in adipose tissue, respectively.These results provide possible mechanisms for the antidiabetic effects of TSPK. TSPK could promote not only glycogenesis but also glucose utilization in peripheral tissue. Our results suggested that TSPK may be used as adjuvant therapy to control blood glucose and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic individuals.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Wright: An overview on its traditional use, phytochemistry, pharmacology, clinical applications, quality control, and toxicity.</a></h1><p>Dioscorea zingiberensis C. H. Wright (D. zingiberensis), Dioscoreaceae, is used extensively in traditional Chinese medicines. The aim of the current review paper is to give a comprehensive overview of the traditional usage and phytochemistry of the plant. Clinical studies performed and products prepared from the plant and active principles will be mentioned. In addition a review of the taxonomy of the genus Dioscorea is given.A systematic search on literature has been performed in databases like Google Scholar, Science Direct, Scifinder, Web of Science, and in Chinese databases (China Knowledge Resource Integrated, i.e., CNKI and Wanfang) including Ph.D. and M.Sc. dissertations. These from the period 1983-2016 have been searched.D. zingiberensis is an endemic plant in China widely distributed in some provinces, especially Hubei and Shaanxi. The rhizomes are the medicinal part in Dun-Ye-Guan-Xin-Ning tablets and are used for isolation of . Steroidal saponins are believed to be the active principles. More than 70 compounds have been identified. Several of these have been tested in preclinical assays and clinical trials. A wide spectrum of biological effects including cardiovascular, anti-thrombosis, , neuroprotection, anti-inflammatory, and anthelmintic effect has been verified.Because of the promising results from the investigations on the plant material of D. zingiberensis, further in depth analyses ought to be performed to evaluate its potential as either a traditional drug or a source of bioactive principle. The presently performed studies do not explain mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics (ADME properties), or toxicity. All of these topics need more elaborate investigations.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p></html>
