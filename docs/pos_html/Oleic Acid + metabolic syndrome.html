The identification of noninvasive biomarkers for NAFLD is of recent interest. Because primary de novo lipogenesis occurs in chicken liver as in human liver, adult chickens with age-associated steatosis resembling human NAFLD is an appealing animal model. The objective of this study was to screen potential biomarkers in the chicken model for NAFLD by transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. Hy-Line W-36 laying hens were fed standard feed from 25 to 45 wk of age to induce fatty liver. They were killed every 4 wk, and liver and plasma were collected at each time point to assess fatty liver development and for transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. Next, selected biomarkers were confirmed in additional experiments by providing supplements of the hepatoprotective nutrients betaine [300, 600, or 900 parts per million (ppm) in vivo; 2 mM in vitro] or docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 1% in vivo; 100 μM in vitro) to 30-wk-old Hy-Line W-36 laying hens for 4 mo and to Hy-Line W-36 chicken primary hepatocytes with -induced steatosis. Liver or hepatocyte lipid contents and the expression of biomarkers were then examined. Plasma acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase (AACS), dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4), glutamine synthetase (GLUL), and glutathione -transferase (GST) concentrations are well-established biomarkers for NAFLD. Selected biomarkers had significant positive associations with hepatic lipid deposition ( < 0.001). Betaine (900 ppm in vivo; 2 mM in vitro) and DHA (1% in vivo; 100 μM in vitro) supplementation both resulted in lower steatosis accompanied by the reduced expression of selected biomarkers in vivo and in vitro ( < 0.05). This study used adult laying hens to identify biomarkers for NAFLD and indicated that AACS, DPP4, GLUL, and GST could be considered to be potential diagnostic indicators for NAFLD in the future.© 2017 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28325998>Glucomannan- and glucomannan plus spirulina-enriched pork affect liver fatty  profile, LDL receptor expression and antioxidant status in Zucker fa/fa rats fed atherogenic diets.</a></h2><p>We evaluated the effects of glucomannan or glucomannan plus spirulina-restructured pork (RP) on liver fatty  profile, desaturase/elongase enzyme activities and oxidative status of Zucker fa/fa rats for seven weeks. Control (C), glucomannan (G) and glucomannan/spirulina (GS)-RP; HC (cholesterol-enriched control), HG and HGS (cholesterol-enriched glucomannan and glucomannan/spirulina-RP) experimental diets were tested. Increased  markers were found in C, G and GS rats. Cholesterol feeding increased liver size, fat, and cholesterol and reduced antioxidant enzyme levels and expressions. Cholesterolemia was lower in HG and HGS than in HC. GS vs. G showed higher stearic but lower  levels. SFA and PUFA decreased while MUFA increased by cholesterol feeding. The arachidonic/linoleic and docosahexaenoic/alpha-linolenic ratios were lower in HC, HG, and HGS vs. C, G, and GS, respectively, suggesting a delta-6-elongase-desaturase system inhibition. Moreover, cholesterol feeding, mainly in HGS, decreased low-density-lipoprotein receptor expression and the delta-5-desaturase activity and increased the delta-9-desaturase activity. In conclusion, the liver production of highly unsaturated fatty acids was limited to decrease their oxidation in presence of hypercholesterolaemia. Glucomannan or glucomannan/spirulina-RP has added new attributes to their functional properties in meat, partially arresting the negative effects induced by high-fat-high-cholesterol feeding on the liver fatty  and antioxidant statuses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25925967>[6]-gingerol dampens hepatic steatosis and inflammation in experimental nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of [6]-gingerol ((S)-5-hydroxy-1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-3-decanone) in experimental models of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. HepG2 cells were exposed to 500 µmol/l  (OA) for 24 h and preincubated for an additional 24 h with [6]-gingerol (25, 50 or 100 µmol/l). [6]-Gingerol (100 µmol/l) inhibited OA-induced triglyceride and inflammatory marker accumulation in HepG2 cells. After being fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 2 weeks, male golden hamsters were dosed orally with [6]-gingerol (25, 50 or 100 mg/kg/day) once daily for 8 weeks while maintained on HFD. [6]-Gingerol (100 mg/kg/day) alleviated liver steatosis, inflammation, and reversed plasma markers of  in HFD-fed hamsters. The expression of inflammatory cytokine genes and nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB) were increased in the HFD group; these effects were attenuated by [6]-gingerol. The hepatic mRNA expression of lipogenic genes such as liver X receptor-α, sterol regulating element binding protein-1c and its target genes including acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty  synthase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, and acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 in HFD-fed hamsters was also blocked by [6]-gingerol. [6]-Gingerol may attenuate HFD-induced steatohepatitis by downregulating NF-κB-mediated inflammatory responses and reducing hepatic lipogenic gene expression.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Particularly in patients infected with non-genotype 3 HCV, hepatic steatosis is closely related to factors of the  such as hyperlipidemia. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this "" steatosis in non-3 genotype HCV infections are not well understood. Here, we aimed to develop an in vitro model to study the effect of genotype 1 HCV infection on hepatic lipotoxicity and lipid metabolism. Cellular lipid accumulation was induced in Huh-7 hepatoma cells transfected with HCV genotype 1b replicon (HCV) by incubation with increasing doses of palmitic  (C16:0) or  (C18:1 n-9) complexed to albumin mimicking hyperlipidemic conditions. Mock transfected hepatoma cells (HCV) were used as controls. Incubation with  concentrations as high as 0.5 mM did not induce toxic effects in HCV or HCV cells. In contrast, incubation with palmitic  caused dose-dependently cytotoxic effects which were more pronounced in HCV compared to HCV cells. Further analysis with subtoxic palmitic and  concentrations revealed a higher uptake of fatty acids and intracellular triglyceride accumulation in HCV compared to HCV cells. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) expression, indicative of mitochondrial beta-oxidation, was markedly stimulated by lipid exposure in HCV but not in HCV cells. Furthermore, heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) expression levels increased in FA stimulated cells, and this increase was significantly higher in HCV compared to HCV cells. In contrast, expression of the key enzymes of hepatic de novo lipogenesis fatty  synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1) was significantly reduced upon oleate exposure in HCV but not in HCV cells. In summary, our newly developed cell culture model revealed effects of HCV genotype 1b infection on  susceptibility to lipid accumulation and toxicity particularly to saturated lipids. These results may indicate that HCV (genotype 1b) infected individuals with hyperlipidemia may benefit from dietary or pharmacological intervention.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

These impairments are associated with the development of cardiovascular disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Correcting the defects in lipid metabolism may attenuate obesity and dyslipidaemia, and reduce cardiovascular risk and liver damage. L-Carnitine supplementation was used in this study to enhance fatty  oxidation so as to ameliorate diet-induced disturbances in lipid metabolism. Male Wistar rats (8-9 weeks old) were fed with either corn starch or high-carbohydrate, high-fat diets for 16 weeks. Separate groups were supplemented with L-carnitine (1.2% in food) on either diet for the last 8 weeks of the protocol. High-carbohydrate, high-fat diet-fed rats showed central obesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinaemia, cardiovascular remodelling and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. L-Carnitine supplementation attenuated these high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet-induced changes, together with modifications in lipid metabolism including the inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 activity, reduced storage of short-chain monounsaturated fatty acids in the tissues with decreased linoleic  content and trans fatty acids stored in retroperitoneal fat. Thus, L-carnitine supplementation attenuated the signs of  through inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 activity, preferential β-oxidation of some fatty acids and increased storage of saturated fatty acids and relatively inert  in the tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30773586>Diets Enriched with Conventional or High- Canola Oils Lower Atherogenic Lipids and Lipoproteins Compared to a Diet with a Western Fatty  Profile in Adults with Central Adiposity.</a></h2><p>Novel oils high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) are an alternative to partially hydrogenated oils high in trans-unsaturated fatty acids.

Fasting serum lipids were assessed at baseline and 6 wk. Diet effects were examined using a repeated measures mixed model.Compared with the control, canola and HOCO diets resulted in lower endpoint total cholesterol (TC; -4.2% and -3.4%; P < 0.0001), LDL cholesterol (-6.6% and -5.6%; P < 0.0001), apoB (-3.7% and -3.4%; P = 0.002), and non-HDL cholesterol (-4.5% and -4.0%; P = 0.001), with no differences between canola diets. The TC:HDL cholesterol and apoB:apoA1 ratios were lower after the HOCO diet than after the control diet (-3.7% and -3.4%, respectively). There were no diet effects on triglyceride, HDL cholesterol, or apoA1 concentrations.HOCO, with increased MUFAs at the expense of decreased PUFAs, elicited beneficial effects on lipids and lipoproteins comparable to conventional canola oil and consistent with reduced cardiovascular disease risk in adults with central adiposity.

The FAHFA levels are significantly decreased in insulin-resistant individuals, their application exhibited anti-inflammatory effects and restoring the glucose-insulin homeostasis. The aim of our research was to analyze the overall FAHFA composition in a common diet, as only a partial FAHFA composition has been revealed so far (only the PAHSA subclass was analyzed in a few foods). A new approach to the FAHFAs analysis includes nano-LC and post-column modifier followed by negative ion mass spectrometry, in order to obtain maximum sensitivity. Analysis of different foods - oat (whole grain, coarse flakes and fine flakes), apple, clementine, lemon, strawberry, blueberry, mango, kiwi, avocado, pineapple, banana, onion, garlic, cherry tomato, carrot, parsley root, pepper and radish - exhibited wide inter-food variation in the FAHFA profiles. Sixteen analyzed FAHFAs (palmitic, , palmitoleic and stearic hydroxy-esters) showed microgram to low nanogram levels (0.165 ng/g - 32 μg/g FW), with the highest abundancy in oat, clementine, garlic and pineapple. Stearic  hydroxy stearic  (SAHSA) was the most abundant FAHFA, especially in the food with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and beneficial  effects.

However, appropriate drugs for treatment of NAFLD are lacking. This study aimed to elucidate the protective effects and mechanisms of Akebia saponin D (ASD) against NAFLD in ob/ob mice and Buffalo rat liver cells. ASD significantly decreased hepatic steatosis and hepatocyte apoptosis in ob/ob mice. ASD also significantly activated autophagic flux, as assessed by the decreased expression of light chain 3 (LC3)-II and P62 accumulation of autophagosomes. In Buffalo rat liver cells, ASD prevented  (OA)-induced lipid droplets and increased autophagic flux acting as increase the number of autolysosomes than autophagosomes in mTagRFP-mWasabi-LC3. ASD treatment also prevented OA-induced expression of LC3-II, P62, Beclin, and phospho-mammalian target of rapamycin. These effects were similar to those of cotreatment with rapamycin. ASD treatment could not prevent OA-increased, autophagy-related protein expression after treatment with chloroquine or small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of atg7. These results suggest that ASD alleviates hepatic steatosis targeted at the fusion of autophagosomes to lysosomes, and autophagy modulation via ASD may offer a new strategy for treating NAFLD.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27804268>Effects of canola and high- canola oils on abdominal fat mass in individuals with central obesity.</a></h2><p>To determine the effect of diets low in saturated fatty acids and high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) or polyunsaturated fatty acids on body composition in participants at risk for  (MetS).This study was a randomized, crossover, controlled feeding study.

Development of the biological function of locomotion and kinetic parameters of the body.]</a></h2><p>Phylogenetic theory of general pathology draws researchers' attention to the following aspects of the biological effects of insulin. 1. Phylogenetically, in vivo insulin is primarily involved in the metabolism of fatty acids (FA) and only in the second turn in glucose metabolism; regulation of FA metabolism in cells started millions of years earlier than that of glucose metabolism. Phylogenetically late insulin blocks lipolysis only in phylogenetically late insulin-dependent subcutaneous adipocytes but not in phylogenetically early visceral fat cells of the omentum. 2. Biological role of insulin consists in the formation of the biological function of locomotion, i.e., movement arising from contraction of striated myocytes provided with substrates (FA and glucose) for energy production as macroergic ATP. 3. Biological destiny of phylogenetically late insulin is transformation of carnivorous (fish-eating) animals living in the ocean into herbivores living on the dry land. 4. Insulin has formed in vivo highly efficient  variant of FA metabolism instead of phylogenetically early less efficient palmitic variant. 5. Biologically, insulin is destined for providing cells with energy and perfection of physical activity and kinetic parameters of the organism. According to phylogenetic theory of general pathology and basic principles of endocrinology, clinical cases should be regarded as: 1. rare structurally-related insulindeficient type I diabetes mellitus, 2. rare structurally-related (receptor pathology) hyperinsulinemic type II diabetes mellitus, and 3. a great number of patients with functional disorders in the hormone activity, insulin resistance ,  and obesity.

Testosterone treatment ameliorates these effects, although the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We compared the influence of testosterone on the expression of regulatory targets of glucose, cholesterol and lipid metabolism in muscle, liver, abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue. Testicular feminised mice displayed significantly reduced GLUT4 in muscle and glycolytic enzymes in muscle, liver and abdominal subcutaneous but not visceral adipose tissue. Lipoprotein lipase required for fatty  uptake was only reduced in subcutaneous adipose tissue; enzymes of fatty  synthesis were increased in liver and subcutaneous tissue.

Master regulator nuclear receptors involved in metabolism-Liver X receptor expression was suppressed in all tissues except visceral adipose tissue, whereas PPARγ was lower in abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue and PPARα only in abdominal subcutaneous.

This study investigates the effects of FA and OZ on alleviating high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFFD)-induced  parameters.Male SD rats were fed with a regular rodent diet, HFFD, or HFFD supplemented with 0.05% FA or 0.16% OZ (equimolar concentrations) for 13 weeks. Food intake, organ indices, serum lipid profiles, glucose metabolism, insulin resistance (IR) index and cytokine levels were analyzed. The mechanisms were further investigated in -stimulated HepG2 cells by analyzing triglyceride (TG) content and lipogenesis-related gene expressions.In the in vivo study, FA and OZ exhibited similar effects in alleviating HFFD-induced obesity, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and IR. However, only OZ treatment significantly decreased liver index and hepatic TG content, lowered serum levels of C-reactive protein and IL-6, and increased serum concentration of adiponectin. In the in vitro assay, only OZ administration significantly inhibited intracellular TG accumulation and down-regulated expression of stearoyl coenzyme-A desaturase-1, which might facilitate OZ to enhance its hepatoprotective effect.OZ is more effective than FA in inhibiting hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation. Thus, FA and OZ could be used as dietary supplements to alleviate the deleterious effects of HFFD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25240692>Docosahexaenoic -enriched canola oil increases adiponectin concentrations: a randomized crossover controlled intervention trial.</a></h2><p>Little is known about the effect of various dietary fatty acids on pro- and anti-inflammatory processes.

Although statins should be used with caution in liver diseases, they are increasingly investigated as a possible treatment for NAFLD. The present study recreated an  model of NAFLD using HepG cells exposed to  (OA), which was used to quantify OA-induced lipid accumulation in HepG cells treated with various concentrations of simvastatin. In addition, the effect of simvastatin on HepG cell morphology and microparticle generation as a marker of cell apoptosis was assessed. OA-induced lipid accumulation was quantified by Oil Red O staining and extraction for optical density determination. Stained lipid droplets were visualized using phase contrast microscopy. Furthermore, HepG cell-derived microparticles were counted by flow cytometry subsequent to staining for Annexin V. HepG cells treated with 0-1 mM OA showed dose-dependent lipid accumulation. Treatment of HepG cells with increasing concentrations of simvastatin followed by treatment with 1 mM OA showed that low simvastatin concentrations (4-10 µM) were able to reduce lipid accumulation by ~40%, whereas high simvastatin concentrations (20 and 30 µM) induced apoptotic changes in cell morphology and increased the production of Annexin V microparticles. This suggests that low simvastatin doses may have a role in preventing NAFLD.

The objectives of this study were to explore the effects of LNPs on adiposity and the mechanisms involved, and to evaluate their impact on  homeostasis.Young Zucker fa/fa rats were treated with LNP599 (10 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks. Effects on body weight, adiposity (regional re-distribution, morphology, and function of adipose tissues), cardiovascular and  homeostasis, and liver function were evaluated. Direct effects on insulin and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling were studied in human hepatoma HepG2 cells.LNP599 treatment limited the age-dependent remodeling and inflammation of subcutaneous, epididymal, and visceral adipose tissues, and prevented total fat deposits and the development of obesity. Body-weight stabilization was not related to reduced food intake but rather to enhanced energy expenditure and thermogenesis. Cardiovascular and  parameters were also improved and were significantly correlated with body weight but not with plasma norepinephrine. Insulin and AMPK signaling were enhanced in hepatic tissues of treated animals, whereas blood markers of hepatic disease and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were reduced. In cultured HepG2 cells, LNP ligands phosphorylated AMPK and the downstream acetyl-CoA carboxylase and prevented -induced intracellular lipid accumulation. They also significantly potentiated insulin-mediated AKT activation and this was independent from AMPK.Selective I imidazoline receptor agonists protect against the development of adiposity and obesity, and the associated cardio- disorders.

The study involved 73 women, including 24 patients with chronic kidney disease treated with haemodialysis, 19 patients with  (MetS), and 30 healthy women in the control group. A total of 35 fatty acids and derivatives were identified and quantified by gas chromatography. Intensified elongation processes from  C10:0 to C16:0 were noted in both groups (more intense in MetS), as well as an increased synthesis of arachidonic  (C20:4n6), which was more intense in CKD.

In the MetS group, auxiliary  pathways of  were activated, which simultaneously inhibited the synthesis of eicosapentanoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) from alpha lipoic  (ALA). On the other hand, in the group of female patients with CKD, the synthesis of EPA and DHA was intensified. Activation of the synthesis of  (C18: 1n9 ct) and trans-vaccinic  (C18:1) is a protective mechanism in kidney diseases and especially in MetS due to the increased concentration of saturated fatty  (SFA) in plasma. The cause of the increased amount of all FAs in plasma in the CKD group, especially in the case of palmitic (C16:0) and derivatives stearic (C18:0) acids, may be the decomposition of adipose tissue and the progressing devastation of the organism, whereas, in the MetS group, dietary intake seems to be the main reason for the increase in SFA. Moreover, in MetS, auxiliary  pathways are activated for , which cause the simultaneous inhibition of EPA and DHA synthesis from ALA, whereas, in the CKD group, we observe an increased synthesis of EPA and DHA.

Acne vulgaris is primarily a disease of wealthy countries and exhibits higher prevalence rates in developed compared with developing countries. No acne has been found in non-Westernized populations still living under Paleolithic dietary conditions constraining hyperglycemic carbohydrates, milk, and dairy products. The high prevalence rates of adolescent acne cannot be explained by the predominance of genetic factors but by the influence of a Western diet that overstimulates the key conductor of metabolism, the nutrient- and growth factor-sensitive kinase mTORC1. Increased mTORC1 activity has been detected in lesional skin and sebaceous glands of acne patients compared with acne-free controls. Increased mTORC1 signaling is a characteristic feature of insulin resistance, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases.

The objective of this secondary analysis is to investigate whether common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in genes involved in DHA synthesis and TAG metabolism are associated with the responsiveness of blood lipids, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein concentration to dietary treatment by DHA supplied in high- canola oil (HOCO). In a randomized, crossover-controlled feeding trial, 129 subjects with  received high- canola oil (HOCO) and high- canola oil supplemented with DHA (HOCO-DHA), each for 4 weeks. During the HOCO-DHA phase, the intake of DHA ranged from 1 to 2.5 g/day.

Excess of meat in the diet leads to high content of palmitic fatty  (FA) in hepatocytes and formation of palmitic triglycerides (TG). Post heparin lipoprotein lipase slowly hydrolyzes palmitic TG in blood plasma lipoproteins and releases small amounts of FA. If dietary carbohydrate content is low, the biological function of exotrophy does not provide the substrate from which hepatocytes can rapidly produce  nonesterified FA de novo. Energy substrate deficiency activates the biological function of adaptation and the biological reaction of compensation. Under the effect of epinephrin NEFA deficiency is compensated via the biological reaction of endotrophy and lipolysis in omental visceral fat cells. In insulin resistance (IR) , the biological function of feeding is realized nonphysiologically while the biological reaction of adaptation is realized physiologically. An increase in NEFA blood content physiologically blocks glucose uptake in cells. Biological role of insulin consists in conversion of distant ocean-living carnivorous (fish-eating) ancestors of Homo sapiens with palmitic type of FA metabolism into herbivorous dry land-living species with  type metabolism of FA. The IR  can be normalized. To this end a) the patient's will to activate the cognitive biological function (intellect) and b) comprehension of the fact that phylogenetically dry land-living Homo sapiens has developed as a herbivorous but not carnivorous species.

CD36, a class B scavenger receptor, is highly expressed in the renal proximal tubules and mediates FFA uptake. It is not clear whether FFA- and proteinuria-mediated CD36 activation coordinates NLRP3 inflammasomes to induce renal tubular injury and inflammation. In this study, we investigated the roles of CD36 and NLRP3 inflammasomes in FFA-induced renal injury in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. HFD-fed C57BL/6 mice and palmitate-treated HK2 renal tubular cells were used as in vivo and in vitro models. Immunohistochemical staining showed that CD36, IL-1β, and IL-18 levels increased progressively in the kidneys of HFD-fed mice. Sulfo- N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO), a CD36 inhibitor, attenuated the HFD-induced upregulation of NLRP3, IL-1β, and IL-18 and suppressed the colocalization of NLRP3 and ASC in renal tubular cells. In vitro, SSO abolished the palmitate-induced activation of IL-1β, IL-18, and caspase-1 in HK2 proximal tubular cells. Furthermore, treatment with SSO and the knockdown of caspase-1 expression by siRNA both inhibited palmitate-induced cell death and apoptosis in HK2 cells. Collectively, palmitate causes renal tubular inflammation, cell death, and apoptosis via the CD36/NLRP3/caspase-1 axis, which may explain, at least in part, the mechanism underlying FFA-related renal tubular injury. The blockade of CD36-induced cellular processes is therefore a promising strategy for treating obesity-related nephropathy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30768879>[The person in philogenesis is not (omnivores), but the herbivores with the carnivores past and the fuzzy future.

Millions of years in life consistently in the waters of several oceans, all the ancestors of man were carnivorous (Carnivores), fish-eating mammals. When the ocean retreated and the carnivorous (fish-eating) were on land, each individual privatized a "piece" of the ocean. Animals transformed it ito a pool of intercellular medium in vivo. The biological role of the late in the phylogeny of insulin is the formation of new biological functions in vivo. The action of insulin has transformed the carnivorous (fish-eating) ocean into herbivorous (Herbivores) species on land. There was it by synthesis in vivo from exogenous glucose of fatty acids (FA). Regulatory action of insulin was the directed conversion of exogenous glucose into ω-6 C18: 1 cis- FA. Insulin late in phylogeny expressed the synthesis of new, conjugated enzymes: it is palmitoyl-CoA-elongase and stearyl-CoAdesaturase. Two enzymes synthesized FAs along the way: synthesized in situ de novo, from exogenous glucose, C16: 0 palmitic  → C18: 0 stearic  → ω-6 C18: 1 cis- without accumulation of stearic FA. Insulin is not converted into an  FA exogenous palmitic  from carnivorous food. On land, the action of insulin transformed the species Homo sapiens, into a herbivore, but with carnivorous, fish-eating, past.

The 60 g treatments included three MUFA-rich diets: (1) conventional canola oil (Canola); (2) DHA-enriched high  canola oil (CanolaDHA); (3) high  canola oil (CanolaOleic); and two PUFA-rich diets: (4) a blend of corn/saﬄower oil (25:75) (CornSaff); and (5) a blend of flax/saﬄower oil (60:40) (FlaxSaff). Stool samples were collected at the end of each period. DNA was extracted and amplified for 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. A total of 17 phyla and 187 genera were identified. While five novel oil treatments failed to alter bacterial phyla composition, obese participants resulted in a higher proportion of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes than overweight or normal weight groups ( = 0.01). Similarly at the genus level, overall bacterial distribution was highly associated with subjects' body mass index (BMI). Treatment effects were observed between MUFA- and PUFA-rich diets, with the three MUFA diets elevating , and Enterobacteriaceae's populations, while the two PUFA-rich diets favored the higher abundance of . High MUFA content feedings also resulted in an increase of  and a decrease of  in obese, but not overweight subjects. Data suggest that BMI is a predominant factor in characterization of human gut microbiota profile, and that MUFA-rich and PUFA-rich diets impact the composition of gut microbiota at lower taxonomical levels mainly in obese subjects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30821938>[The physical chemical and biological features of triglycerides.

The pathology of low density lipoproteins is primary deficiency of poly-unsaturated fatty acids in cells, atherosclerosis and atheromotosis of intima of arteries of elastic type with development of dense plaques from poly-unsaturated fatty acids in the form of polyethers of cholesterol. The pathology of very low-density lipoproteins includes: a)  of resistance to insulin; b) pathology of phylogenetically earlier insulin-independent visceral fatty tissue - ; c) pathology of phylogenetically later insulin-dependent subcutaneous adipocytes - obesity; d) secondary atherosclerosis, under cumulation of palmitic low-density lipoproteins in blood with development of atherothrombosis of intima of arteries, soft plaques rich with triglycerides. As for the prevention of disorders of transfer of fatty acids to very low-density lipoproteins and low-density lipoproteins is common in many ways - minimization of aphysiological effect of surplus amount of food, biological function of diet.

Lauric C12 LC is half the FA in coconut oil. Residents of southeast Asia with constant use of coconut oil, have a low level of diseases of the cardiovascular system in the population. With a regulatory intake with food C12:0 laurin FA formed moderate ketosis and neuroprotective effect. Unlike long-chain LC, medium-chain TG cells are not deposited either in visceral fat cells, or in insulin-dependent adipocytes. Medium-chain fatty acids rapidly oxidize mitochondria; the formation of acetyl-CoA cells is used to form ketone bodies, activating thermogenesis in orange and brown adipocytes. Experiments with animals and observations in the clinic showed that taking medium-chain TG with food is more physiological than long-chain oils. This significantly increases the level of cholesterol in high-density lipoproteins. Food enriched with medium chain TG is optimal for increasing the ketone content in blood plasma, cerebrospinal fluid without limiting the carbohydrate content in food. The formation of excess ketone bodies by cells can be achieved by activating the  transformations of medium-chain FAs, without fasting and preserving carbohydrates in food. Coconut oil has a positive effect on the cardiovascular system, preventing the formation of atherosclerosis and atheromatosis. Effective in the prevention of the pathology of the cardiovascular system is a decrease in food amounts of palmitic , an increase in , polyene FA with a simultaneous increase in the proportion of medium-chain FA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29964320>Alterations in cellular lipid metabolism produce neutral lipid accumulation following exposure to the organochlorine compound trans-nonachlor in rat primary hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Recent epidemiological studies have revealed significant positive associations between exposure to organochlorine (OC) pesticides and occurrence of the  and there are a growing number of animal-based studies to support causality. However, the cellular mechanisms linking OC compound exposure and  dysfunction remain elusive. Therefore, the present study was designed to determine if direct exposure to three highly implicated OC compounds promoted hepatic steatosis, the hepatic ramification of the . First, the steatotic effect of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), oxychlordane, and trans-nonachlor was determined in freshly isolated rat primary hepatocytes. Exposure to trans-nonachlor significantly increased neutral lipid accumulation as opposed to DDE and oxychlordane. To determine possible mechanisms governing increased fatty  availability, the effects of trans-nonachlor exposure on fatty  uptake, de novo lipogenesis, triglyceride secretion, and fatty  oxidation were explored. Trans-nonachlor did not significantly alter fatty  uptake. However, insulin-stimulated de novo lipogenesis as well as basal expression of fatty  synthase, a major regulator of lipogenesis were significantly increased following trans-nonachlor exposure. Interestingly, there was a significant decrease in fatty  oxidation following trans-nonachlor exposure. This decrease in fatty  oxidation was accompanied by a slight, but significant increase in -induced cellular triglyceride secretion. Therefore, taken together, the present data indicate direct exposure to trans-nonachlor has a more potent pro-steatotic effect than exposure to DDE or oxychlordane. This pro-steatotic effect of trans-nonachlor appears to be predominately mediated via increased de novo lipogenesis and decreased fatty  oxidation.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31509653>[The cognitive biological function, difference in etiology and generality of pathogenesis of  pandemics.

Cumulative lines of evidence suggest that olive oil, used as primary source of fat by Mediterranean populations, may play a key role in the observed health benefits on NAFLD. In this review, we summarize the state of the art of the knowledge on the protective role of both major and minor components of olive oil on lipid metabolism during NAFLD. In particular, the biochemical mechanisms responsible for the increase or decrease in hepatic lipid content are critically analyzed, taking into account that several studies have often provided different and/or conflicting results in animal models fed on olive oil-enriched diet. In addition, new findings that highlight the hypolipidemic and the antisteatotic actions of olive oil phenols are presented. As mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, the targeting of these organelles with olive oil phenols as a powerful therapeutic approach is also discussed.© 2015 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27399675>The Effect of Resveratrol and Quercetin Treatment on PPAR Mediated Uncoupling Protein (UCP-) 1, 2, and 3 Expression in Visceral White Adipose Tissue from  Rats.</a></h2><p>Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are members of the mitochondrial anion carrier superfamily involved in the control of body temperature and energy balance regulation.

We studied the gene expression regulation of UCP1, -2, and -3 in abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) from control and MetS rats treated with two doses of a commercial mixture of resveratrol (RSV) and quercetin (QRC). We found that UCP2 was the predominantly expressed isoform, UCP3 was present at very low levels, and UCP1 was undetectable. The treatment with RSV + QRC did not modify UCP3 levels; however, it significantly increased UCP2 mRNA in control and MetS rats in association with an increase in  and linoleic fatty acids. WAT from MetS rats showed a significantly increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α and PPAR-γ when compared to the control group. Furthermore, PPAR-α protein levels were increased by the highest dose of RSV + QRC in the control and MetS groups. PPAR-γ expression was only increased in the control group.

Variation of the apolipoprotein E (Apo E) genotype may contribute to the diverse response to diet in lipid metabolism and influence the association between fatty acids in plasma and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The aim of this investigation was to analyze the interaction between Apo E isoforms and plasma fatty acids, influencing phenotypes related to  diseases in Alaskan Natives. A sample of 427 adult Siberian Yupik Alaskan Natives was included. Fasting glucose, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, Apo A1, and Apo B plasma concentrations were measured using reference methods. Concentrations of 13 fatty acids in fasting plasma were analyzed by gas chromatography, and Apo E variants were identified. Analyses of covariance were conducted to identify Apo E isoform and fatty  main effects and multiplicative interactions. The means for body mass index and age were 26 ± 5.2 and 47 ± 1.5, respectively. Significant main effects were observed for variation in Apo E and different fatty acids influencing Apo B levels, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. Significant interactions were found between Apo E isoform and selected fatty acids influencing total cholesterol, triglycerides, and Apo B concentrations. In summary, Apo E3/3 and 3/4 isoforms had significant interactions with circulating levels of stearic, palmitic,  fatty acids, and phenotypes of lipid metabolism in Alaskan Natives.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Silymarin, an extract of the milk thistle (Silybum marianum), is a dietary supplement that is widely used in western society for the prevention and treatment of liver problems. Crataegus Fructus (hawthorn) is traditionally used to promote digestion and dissipate food stagnation. Momordica charantia (bitter melon) is traditionally used for treatment of diabetes in Ayurvedic Medicine.We aimed to develop a multi-targeted herbal formula to target on the multiple risk factors of  using individual herbs. This proposed herbal formula include sylimarin and Schisandrae Fructus, for NAFLD; Crataegus Fructus for obesity and hyperlipidemia; and Momordica charantia for hyperglycemia.For in vitro study, we carried out insulin-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiation and fluorescent tagged cholesterol-treated Caco-2 cell assay to study for adipogenesis and cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells, respectively. -induced HepG2 cell assay was used to study for -induced fatty liver, and brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) assay was used to study for glucose uptake from the gut. For in vivo study, we performed an 8-week and a 12-week treatment studies, with each study comprising of 4 groups of C57Bl/6 male mice given: (i) Normal-chow diet; (ii)-(iv) High-fat diet (contains 21% fat and 0.15% cholesterol). After the initial 8 weeks of normal chow or high-fat diet feeding to induce obesity, animals were given: (i) Normal-chow diet; (ii) High-fat diet; (iii) High-fat diet + 2% herbal formula; or (iv) High-fat diet + 4% herbal formula as treatment for another 8 weeks or 12 weeks.Our in vitro results suggested Crataegus Fructus aqueous extract exerted potent inhibitory effects on 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiation and cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells. Schisandrae Fructus aqueous extract and milk thistle exerted inhibitory effects on -induced fatty liver in HepG2 cells. Momordica charantia extract on the other hand, exerted significant inhibitory effect on glucose uptake into BBMV. Our in vivo results showed that our herbal formula exhibited a trend to reduce diet-induced increase in body weight and fat pad mass (epididymal, perirenal and inguinal fat); and significantly reduced diet-induced increase in liver weight, liver lipid, and plasma lipid dose-dependently. Besides, high-fat diet induced a significant reduction in adiponectin level which was significantly improved by herbal formula supplementation at 4%. There was however no significant effect of the herbal formula on diet-induced increase in plasma glucose or insulin levels at either dose. Herbal formula also significantly reduced diet-induced inflammation in the liver at both doses.Taken together, these data suggested the potential of our novel multi-targeted herbal formula to be used as a therapeutic agent for diet-induced , with special emphasis on NAFLD.Copyright © 2018.

DNA methylation is a potent regulator of gene expression and may be associated with protein levels. In this study we investigate whether the effect of dietary fatty acids on TNFa released from adipocytes might be associated with modifications of the TNFa promoter DNA methylation status. A group of rats was assigned to three diets with a different composition of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Samples of visceral adipose tissues were taken for adipocyte isolation, in which released TNFa levels were measured, and for methylation and expression studies. In addition, 3 T3-L1 cells were treated with palmitic,  and linoleic acids, with and without 5-Azacitydine (5-AZA). After treatments, cells and supernatants were included in the same analyses as rat samples. TNFa promoter methylation levels, gene expression and secretion were different according to the diets and fatty  treatments associated with them. Cells treated with 5-AZA displayed higher TNFa levels than in the absence of 5-AZA, without differences between fatty acids. According to our results, dietary fatty  regulation of adipocyte TNFa levels may be mediated by epigenetic modifications of the TNFa promoter DNA methylation levels.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

VA reduced the EC, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), in the liver and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) relative to control diet (P< 0.001), but did not change AA in tissue PLs. There was no additive effect of combining VA+CLA on 2-AG relative to VA alone (P> 0.05). Interestingly, VA increased jejunal concentrations of anandamide and those of the noncannabinoid signaling molecules, oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide, relative to control diet (P< 0.05). This was consistent with a lower jejunal protein abundance (but not activity) of their degrading enzyme, fatty  amide hydrolase, as well as the mRNA expression of TNFα and interleukin 1β (P< 0.05).

Furthermore, Resveratrol, a Sirt1 activator, significantly reduced lipogenic gene expressions, while EX-527, a Sirt1 specific inhibitor, had the opposite effects.Our results demonstrated that inhibition of NAMPT aggravated the HFD- or -induced hepatic steatosis through suppressing Sirt1-mediated signaling pathway. On the one hand, the inhibition of NAMPT reduced the production of NAD through inhibiting the NAD salvage pathway, resulting in the decrease of Sirt1 activity, and then attenuated the deacetylation of SREBP1 in which the inhibition of SREBP1 activity promoted the expressions of FASN and ACC. On the other hand, the reduced Sirt1 activity alleviated the activation of AMPKα to further enhance SREBP1 activities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315213>Nutraceutical Potential of  in .</a></h2><p> L. is a well-known fruit worldwide, and its highest production occurs in tropical and subtropical regions.

Increasing evidences suggest favorable effects of n-3 PUFA for protecting against obesity and the . However, the regulation of n-3 PUFA in adipose is still unclear. Thus, this study addressed metabolism of different dietary fats in the adipose tissue of porcine model.Eight-week-old cross-bred pigs were randomly assigned to three groups and fed a 2% fat diet for 30 days from either soybean oil (SBO), docosahexaenoic  (DHA) or beef tallow. An in vitro experiment was conducted in which linoleic  (LA), DHA or  (OA) were added to represent the major fatty  in the SBO-, DHA- or BT- diets, respectively. Adipocytes size and lipid metabolism related genes were analyzed.Plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) was lower in DHA- than in BT-fed pigs, and the product of lipolysis, glycerol was highest in BT-fed pigs. In addition, expression of the lipolytic genes, adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone sensitive lipase was higher in BT-fed pigs and with OA treatment in vitro. DHA promoted protein kinase A activity in pigs without affecting lipolytic genes. Adipocyte cell sizes, TAG content and expression of lipogenic-related genes including, adipose differentiated related protein (ADRP) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) were elevated by DHA in vivo and in vitro, indicating DHA promoted adipogenesis to trap TAG in adipose tissue. Fatty  β-oxidation genes were increased in the DHA-fed pigs.This effect was partly explained by the effect of DHA to promote adipogenesis to trap TAG in adipocytes and also increase expression of genes involved in adipocyte fatty  oxidation. Therefore, our results suggest a direct effect of DHA on adipocyte metabolism, resulting in TAG turnover and fatty  dissipation to facilitate plasma lipid uptake from the circulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30487558>Extra virgin olive oil: More than a healthy fat.</a></h2><p>The beneficial effects of a Mediterranean diet on human health and, in particular, on lowering risk of cardiovascular disease, has been mainly attributed to its high content to extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). While its main fatty , , is considered important to these effects, EVOO has other biological properties that depend on, or are potentiated by other minor components of this oil. Initially, the mechanisms considered as possible causes of this cardioprotective effect of EVOO were based on the incidence on the so-called traditional risk factors (especially lipids and blood pressure). However, the high relative reduction in the prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were not proportional to the limited findings about regulation of those traditional risk factors. In addition to several studies confirming the above effects, current research on beneficial effect of EVOO, and in particular in conjunction with Mediterranean style diets, is being focused on defining its effects on newer cardiovascular risk factors, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, coagulation, platelet aggregation, fibrinolysis, endothelial function or lipids or on the modulation of the conditions which predispose people to cardiovascular events, such as obesity,  or type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the current review, we will mainly focus on reviewing the current evidence about the effects that EVOO exerts on alternative factors, including postprandial lipemia or coagulation, among others, discussing the underlying mechanism by which it exerts its effect, as well as providing a short review on future directions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29031387> pathways of  and palmitic  are intensified in PCOS patients with normal androgen levels.</a></h2><p>The aetiology and pathogenesis polycystic ovary  (PCOS) remain uncertain and thus the relative studies are still crucial.Our aim was to analyse the fatty acids profiles of the main phospholipids species in serum from women with PCOS classified into phenotypes, and to diagnose women more susceptible to the occurrence of inflammatory state.PCOS screening tests were performed in The Clinic of Gynecology and Urogynecology of Pomeranian Medical University in the 2014-2015 years.The study are designed for general community and a primary care or referral center.39 patients with PCOS, diagnosed according to Rotterdam's criteria, and 14 healthy women, as a control group, participated in this study.

Being part of the , NAFLD is characterized by the deposition of triglycerides (TGs) as lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of hepatic cells. Recently, the rapid development of high-throughput genome analysis technologies provided opportunities to screen for new drugs for NAFLD. In this study, we screened for potential drugs based on the gene expression profiles of 73 compounds and identified histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors as a novel treatment for the accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes. In the subsequent analysis and experiments, we discovered that SAHA inhibited the fatty  and lipid metabolism pathways in hepatic cells and induced a significant deficiency of lipid accumulation in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells. Furthermore, SAHA inhibited lipid synthesis in hepatic cells by directly suppressing the expression of DGAT2. Hence, our study provides a novel method to screen for effective drugs for liver diseases and identifies SAHA as a potent treatment for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28731787>Effect of Euterpe oleracea Mart.

The oil from the fruits of Euterpe oleracea (OFEO) is rich in unsaturated fatty acids with potential for treating alterations in lipid metabolism. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of OFEO on hyperlipidemia induced by Cocos nucifera L. saturated fat (GSC) in Wistar rats. Chromatographic profile showed that unsaturated fatty acids account for 66.08% in OFEO, predominately  (54.30%), and saturated fatty acids (palmitic  31.6%) account for 33.92%. GSC-induced dyslipidemia resulted in an increase in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and liver and abdominal fat, as well as atherogenic processes in the thoracic aorta. OFEO treatment did not reduce hypertriglyceridemia, but did reduce total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, thus contributing to the antiatherogenic action of OFEO. OFEO treatment inhibited the formation of atheromatous plaques in the vascular endothelium of the treated rats, as well as those who were treated with simvastatin.

In our previously study, total sesquiterpene glycosides (TSG) isolated from Loquat leaf exhibited therapeutic effect on Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in vivo, but the accurate active compound remains unknown. Sesquiterpene glycoside 1 (SG1) is a novel compound, which is exclusively isolated from Loquat leaf, but its biological activity has been rarely reported. The present study was designed to evaluate the pharmacological effect of SG1, the main component of TSG, in  (OA)-induced HepG2 cell model of NAFLD with its related mechanisms of action. In this study, both SG1 and TSG were found to signiﬁcantly reduce the lipid deposition in the cell model. They could also decrease total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and intracellular free fatty  (FFA) contents. Compared with OA-treated cells, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) level increased, and the malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal levels respectively decreased after the administration of SG1 or TSG. The high dose of SG1 (140 μg/mL) displayed a similar therapeutic effect as TSG at 200 μg/mL. Both SG1 and TSG were found to suppress the expression of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and the phosphorylation of c-jun terminal kinase (JNK) and its downstream target c-Jun in OA-treated cell. These results demonstrate again that TSG are probably the main responsible chemical profiles of Loquat leaf for the treatment of NAFLD, for which it can effectively improve OA-induced steatosis and reduce oxidative stress, probably by downregulating of CYP2E1 expression and JNK/c-Jun phosphorylation, while SG1 may be the principle compound.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The presence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; hepatosteatosis) in obesity has been linked to the worsening of the , including the development of insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. Currently, there are few options to treat NAFLD, including life style changes and insulin sensitizers. Recent evidence suggests that the cannabinoids Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) and cannabidiol (CBD) improve insulin sensitivity; we aimed at studying their effects on lipid levels.The effects of THCV and CBD on lipid levels were examined in a variety of in vitro and in vivo systems, with special emphasis on models of hepatosteatosis. Transcriptional, post-translational and metabolomic changes were assayed.THCV and CBD directly reduce accumulated lipid levels in vitro in a hepatosteatosis model and adipocytes. Nuclear magnetic resonance- (NMR) based metabolomics confirmed these results and further identified specific  changes in THCV and CBD-treated hepatocytes. Treatment also induced post-translational changes in a variety of proteins such as CREB, PRAS40, AMPKa2 and several STATs indicating increased lipid metabolism and, possibly, mitochondrial activity. These results are supported by in vivo data from zebrafish and obese mice indicating that these cannabinoids are able to increase yolk lipid mobilization and inhibit the development of hepatosteatosis respectively.Our results suggest that THCV and CBD might be used as new therapeutic agents for the pharmacological treatment of obesity- and -related NAFLD/hepatosteatosis.Copyright © 2015.

The aim of this study was to determine the role of high-fat low-cholesterol diets (HFLCDs) rich in SFAs (HFLCD-SFAs), MUFAs (HFLCD-MUFAs) or MUFAs plus omega-3 long-chain PUFAs (HFLCD-PUFAs) on vascular calcification by the modulation of the RANKL/RANK/OPG system in the aortic roots of LepLDLR mice. Animals fed with HFLCD-SFAs had increased weight and a greater atheroma plaque size, calcification, and RANKL/CATHK expression in the aortic root than mice on MUFA-enriched diets, with an increasing OPG expression in the aortic roots of the latter. Our study demonstrates that compared to dietary SFAs, MUFAs from olive oil protect against atherosclerosis by interfering with vascular calcification via the RANKL/RANK/OPG system in the setting of MetS. These findings open opportunities for developing novel nutritional strategies with olive oil as the most important dietary source of MUFAs (notably ) to prevent cardiovascular complications in MetS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28298293>Discovery and fine-mapping of loci associated with MUFAs through trans-ethnic meta-analysis in Chinese and European populations.</a></h2><p>MUFAs are unsaturated FAs with one double bond and are derived from endogenous synthesis and dietary intake.

A Mass Spectrometry And Nuclear Magnetic Resonance - based metabolomics study.</a></h2><p> (MetS) represents a group of abnormalities that enhances the risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes and stroke. The Mediterranean diet seems to be an important dietary pattern, which reduces the incidence of MetS. Hydroxytyrosol (HT) - a simple phenol found in olive oil - has received increased attention for its antioxidant activity. Recently, the European Foods Safety Authority (EFSA) claimed that dietary consumption of HT exhibits a protective role against cardiovascular disease. In this study, an experimental protocol has been setup, including isolated HT administration in a diet induced model of MetS in young Wistar rats, in order to find out whether HT has a protective effect against MetS. Rats were randomly divided into two groups nurtured by high-carbohydrate high-fat (H) (MetS inducing diet) and high-carbohydrate high-fat + HT (HHT). HT (20mg/kg/d oral gavage, water vehicle) was administered for 8 weeks on the basal diet. Previous pharmacological evaluation of HT showed that hepatic steatosis was reduced and the inflammatory cells into the liver were infiltrated. These indicate that HT shows bioactivity against . Therefore, the metabolomics evaluation of liver extracts would indicate the putative biochemical mechanisms of HT activity. Thus, the extracts of liver tissues were analyzed using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography - High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS, Orbitrap Discovery) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Bruker Avance III 600MHz). Multivariate analysis was performed in order to gain insight on the  effects of HT administration on the liver metabolome. Normalization employing multiple internal standards and Quality Control-based Robust LOESS (LOcally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing) Signal Correction algorithm (QC-RLSC) was added in the processing pipeline to enhance the reliability of metabolomic analysis by reducing unwanted information. Experimentally, HHT rats were clearly distinguished from H in PLS-DA, showing differences in the liver metabolome between the groups and specific biomarkers were determined supporting the pharmacological findings. More specifically, HT has shown to be effective towards the mobilization of lipids as various lipid classes being differentially regulated between the H and HHT groups. Interestingly branched fatty  esters of hydroxy  acids (OAHSA) lipids have been shown to be up regulated to the HHT group, denoting the alleviation of the MetS to the animals administered with HT.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The hypothesis that n-3 PUFA, which modulate protein homoeostasis via effects on insulin sensitivity, could contribute to maintain muscle mass during energy restriction was tested in rats fed a high-fat diet (4 weeks) rich in 18 : 1 n-9 (, OLE-R), 18 : 3 n-3 (α-linolenic , ALA-R) or n-3 long-chain (LC-R) fatty  and then energy restricted (8 weeks). A control group (OLE-ad libitum (AL)) was maintained with AL diet throughout the study. Rats were killed 10 min after an i.v. insulin injection. All energy-restricted rats lost weight and fat mass, but only the OLE-R group showed a significant muscle loss. The Gastrocnemius muscle was enriched with ALA in the ALA-R group and with LC-PUFA in the ALA-R and LC-R groups. The proteolytic ubiquitin-proteasome system was differentially affected by energy restriction, with MAFbx and muscle ring finger-1 mRNA levels being decreased in the LC-R group (-30 and -20 %, respectively). RAC-α serine/threonine-protein kinase and insulin receptor substrate 1 phosphorylation levels increased in the LC-R group (+70 %), together with insulin receptor mRNA (+50 %). The ALA-R group showed the same overall activation pattern as the LC-R group, although to a lesser extent. In conclusion, dietary n-3 PUFA prevent the loss of muscle mass associated with energy restriction, probably by an improvement in the insulin-signalling pathway activation, in relation to enrichment of plasma membranes in n-3 LC-PUFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25605057>Puerarin ameliorates hepatic steatosis by activating the PPARα and AMPK signaling pathways in hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by the hepatic manifestation of  and is the leading cause of chronic liver disease. Steatohepatitis plays a critical role in the process resulting in liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Puerarin is a herbal product widely used in Asia, and is believed to have therapeutic benefits for alleviating the symptoms of steatohepatitis. The present study was designed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of action of puerarin in reducing lipid accumulation in  (OA)-treated HepG2 cells. Hepatocytes were treated with OA with or without puerarin to observe lipid accumulation by Oil Red O staining. We also examined hepatic lipid contents (e.g., triacylglycerol and cholesterol) following treatment with puerarin. Western blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to measure sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1, fatty  synthase (FAS), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) protein and mRNA expression, respectively. Our results revealed that puerarin suppressed OA-induced lipid accumulation, and reduced the triacylglycerol and cholesterol levels. Furthermore, puerarin decreased the expression levels of lipogenic enzymes, such as FAS and SREBPs, and increased the expression levels of PPARα, which are critical regulators of hepatic lipid metabolism through the AMPK signaling pathway. These results indicate that puerarin has the same ability to activate AMPK, and reduce SREBP-1 and FAS expression, thus inhibiting hepatic lipogenesis and increasing hepatic antioxidant activity. We found that puerarin exerted a regulatory effect on lipid accumulation by decreasing lipogenesis in hepatocytes. Therefore, puerarin extract may have therapeutic benefits in the treatment of fatty liver and lipid-related  disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27356240>Dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids and oleate enhances exercise training effects in patients with .</a></h2><p>We studied the effects of exercise training alone or combined with dietary supplementation of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Ω-3PUFA) and oleate on  (MSyn) components and other markers of cardiometabolic health.Thirty-six patients with MSyn underwent 24 weeks of high-intensity interval training.

In the present study, we analyzed the modulation of the gut microbiota in mice infected with the helminth Strongyloides venezuelensis, and fed either a standard rodent chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD). To investigate the effects of the microbiota modulation on the metabolism, we analyzed the expression of tight-junction proteins present in the gut epithelium, inflammatory markers in the serum and tissue and quantified glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and resistance. Additionally, the levels of lipids related to inflammation were evaluated in the feces and serum. Our results show that infection with Strongyloides venezuelensis results in a modification of the gut microbiota, most notably by increasing Lactobacillus spp. These modifications in the microbiota alter the host metabolism by increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, switching macrophages from a M1 to M2 pattern in the adipose tissue, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins in the intestinal cells (thereby reducing the permeability) and decreasing LPS in the serum. Taken together, these changes correlate with improved insulin signaling and sensitivity, which could also be achieved with HFD mice treated with probiotics. Additionally, helminth infected mice produce higher levels of , which participates in anti-inflammatory pathways. These results suggest that modulation of the microbiota by helminth infection or probiotic treatment causes a reduction in subclinical inflammation, which has a positive effect on the glucose metabolism of the host.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This study compared TG fatty  profile of adults with and without abdominal obesity and examined the associations of these fatty acids with MetS components.Fifty-four abdominally obese subjects were matched by age and sex with 54 adults without abdominal obesity. People were classified with MetS according to the harmonizing criteria for MetS. Fatty acids in plasma TGs were analyzed by gas chromatography.There were no differences in fatty acids of plasma TGs between people with and without abdominal obesity. However, there were differences between abdominally obese people with and without MetS. The abdominally obese group with MetS had higher palmitic (+2.9%; P = 0.012) and  (+4.0%; P = 0.001) acids and lower linoleic (-6.4%; P = 0.018) and arachidonic (-1.2%; P = 0.004) acids. After adjustment for abdominal obesity, age, and sex, a stepwise regression analysis showed that palmitic  positively contributed to the variance in insulin (β = +1.08 ± 1.01; P = 0.000) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index (β = +1.09 ± 1.01; P = 0.000) and myristic  positively contributed to the variance in systolic blood pressure (β = +1.09 ± 1.03; P = 0.006).

Resistin secretion was significantly induced by palmitic , linoleic  and  in adipocytes.OLI is a physiological repressor of systemic resistin release whereas FFA upregulate resistin release in vitro from adipocytes.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30301276>Impact of Blood or Erythrocyte Membrane Fatty Acids for Disease Risk Prediction: Focusing on Cardiovascular Disease and Chronic Kidney Disease.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids (FAs) are essential nutrients and main constituents of cell membranes that are involved in the signaling pathway and associated with health conditions. We investigated if blood or erythrocyte membrane FAs can predict the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and related complications. Omega-3 (-3) FAs are important predictors for , diabetes, CVD, and CKD risks, and the -3 index is also a good biomarker for sudden cardiac death in coronary artery disease. Linoleic , which is one of the major -6 FAs reflecting recent dietary FA intake, may predict CVD risk and mortality in the general population and patients with CKD. Monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs) are also related to diabetes or diabetic nephropathy. , a major MUFA, is an emerging marker that is related to acute coronary , low glomerular filtration rate, and vascular calcification in patients with CKD, and can be modified by -3 FA supplementation. Saturated FAs, -FAs, and FA desaturation/elongation are associated with CVD risk; however, few studies have been conducted on patients with CKD. In summary, blood or erythrocyte membrane FA measurements are important for CVD and CKD risk prediction and management. Further studies are needed to elucidate the FAs for their risk predictions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27078880>Omega-9  Induces Fatty  Oxidation and Decreases Organ Dysfunction and Mortality in Experimental Sepsis.</a></h2><p>Sepsis is characterized by inflammatory and  alterations, which lead to massive cytokine production, oxidative stress and organ dysfunction. In severe systemic inflammatory response , plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) are increased. Several NEFA are deleterious to cells, activate Toll-like receptors and inhibit Na+/K+-ATPase, causing lung injury. A Mediterranean diet rich in olive oil is beneficial. The main component of olive oil is omega-9  (OA), a monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA). We analyzed the effect of OA supplementation on sepsis. OA ameliorated clinical symptoms, increased the survival rate, prevented liver and kidney injury and decreased NEFA plasma levels in mice subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). OA did not alter food intake and weight gain but diminished reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and NEFA plasma levels. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase IA (CPT1A) mRNA levels were increased, while uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) liver expression was enhanced in mice treated with OA. OA also inhibited the decrease in 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) expression and increased the enzyme expression in the liver of OA-treated mice compared to septic animals. We showed that OA pretreatment decreased NEFA concentration and increased CPT1A and UCP2 and AMPK levels, decreasing ROS production. We suggest that OA has a beneficial role in sepsis by decreasing  dysfunction, supporting the benefits of diets high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26166015>Serum Trans-Fatty  Concentration Is Elevated in Young Patients With Coronary Artery Disease in Japan.</a></h2><p>Adverse effects of dietary intake of trans-fatty acids (TFA) on the incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) are well recognized in Western countries. The risk of TFA, however, has not been well clarified in Japan. We investigated the association of serum TFA concentration with serum lipid profile, coronary risk factors, and prevalence of CAD.A total of 902 patients, who were hospitalized at Kobe University Hospital from July 2008 to March 2012 and gave written informed consent, were enrolled in this study. Among them, 463 patients had CAD, and 318 patients had  (MetS). Serum TFA, elaidic  (trans-9-C18:1) and linolelaidic  (trans-9, 12-C18:2), were measured on gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Serum TFA level had a positive correlation with body mass index, waist circumference, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B48, and an inverse correlation with age and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Fasting serum TFA, by age quartile in the young generation with CAD and/or MetS, was higher than that in patients without CAD and/or MetS. On multivariate logistic regression, TFA was identified as a CAD risk after adjustment for classical risk factors.Serum TFA concentration was elevated in young patients with CAD and/or MetS. Diet-derived TFA may cause a serious health problem, particularly in the young generation in Japan.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340670>Diesel Exhaust Induces Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Hyperlipidemia, and Liver Steatosis.</a></h2><p>Air pollution is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as well as dyslipidemia and . Our goal was to dissect the mechanisms involved. Approach and Results: We assessed the effects of exposure to air pollution on lipid metabolism in mice through assessment of plasma lipids and lipoproteins, oxidized fatty acids 9-HODE (9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic) and 13-HODE (13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic), lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism. Findings were corroborated, and mechanisms were further assessed in HepG2 hepatocytes in culture. ApoE knockout mice exposed to inhaled diesel exhaust (DE, 6 h/d, 5 days/wk for 16 weeks) exhibited elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increased hepatic triglyceride content, and higher hepatic levels of 9-HODE and 13-HODE, as compared to control mice exposed to filtered air. A direct effect of DE exposure on hepatocytes was demonstrated by treatment of HepG2 cells with a methanol extract of DE particles followed by loading with . As observed in vivo, this led to increased triglyceride content and significant downregulation of ACAD9 mRNA expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with DE particles and  did not alter de novo lipogenesis but inhibited total, mitochondrial, and ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment of isolated mitochondria, prepared from mouse liver, with DE particles and  also inhibited mitochondrial complex activity and β-oxidation.DE exposure leads to dyslipidemia and liver steatosis in ApoE knockout mice, likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased lipid catabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30611723>Farnesol induces fatty  oxidation and decreases triglyceride accumulation in steatotic HepaRG cells.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is manifested by hepatic accumulation of triglycerides (TG) and is commonly associated with . The isoprenoid farnesol (FOH) modulates lipid metabolism and reduces hepatic TG content in rodents. This effect involves activation of at least two nuclear receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and farnesoid X receptor. We evaluated the effects of FOH (100 μM) in a cellular model of human hepatic steatosis by loading hepatocyte-like HepaRG cells with  (OA, 0.66 mM). FOH treatment decreased OA-induced TG accumulation by ~25%. Using PCR arrays, we found that FOH treatment modulated the mRNA levels of several lipid-metabolizing enzymes, both alone and when cells were loaded with OA. While FOH activated PPARα and the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), most of the FOH-mediated effects on lipid-metabolizing genes could be attributed to activation of PPARα. In OA-loaded HepaRG cells, FOH increased fatty  oxidation, which was accompanied by up-regulation of PPARα target genes involved in mitochondrial fatty  oxidation, including hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase/3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase/enoyl-CoA hydratase and acetyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase 2. These effects on gene expression were lost when the cells were co-treated with the PPARα antagonist, GW6471. OA treatment alone decreased the mRNA levels of the drug-metabolizing enzymes, cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A2, 2B6, and 3A4, and increased CYP2E1 expression, all of which were attenuated by FOH co-treatment. These findings show that FOH treatment increases fatty  oxidation and decreases TG accumulation in steatotic HepaRG cells, which is likely attributable to PPARα-mediated induction of mitochondrial fatty  oxidation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), a flagellin receptor, is required for gut microbiota homeostasis. Accordingly, TLR5-deficient (T5KO) mice are prone to develop microbiota-dependent . Here we observed that T5KO mice display elevated neutral lipids with a compositional increase of oleate [C18:1 (n9)] relative to wild-type littermates. Increased oleate contribution to hepatic lipids and liver SCD1 expression were both microbiota dependent. Analysis of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and (13)C-acetate label incorporation revealed elevated SCFA in ceca and hepatic portal blood and increased liver de novo lipogenesis in T5KO mice. Dietary SCFAs further aggravated  in T5KO mice. Deletion of hepatic SCD1 not only prevented hepatic neutral lipid oleate enrichment but also ameliorated  in T5KO mice. Collectively, these results underscore the key role of the gut microbiota-liver axis in the pathogenesis of  diseases.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p></html>
