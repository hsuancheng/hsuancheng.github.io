Several pharmacologic therapies have shown some promise; currently, vitamin E and insulin-sensitizing agents such as pioglitazone can be considered in appropriate cases. Conservative measures to promote weight loss still have a role to play, but the obesity epidemic in the Western World has reached such proportions that bariatric surgery is proving to be an attractive option for patients with a BMI greater than 35 to 40 kg/. Well-designed prospective studies are required to ensure that all of these therapies are safe and effective in the long term. Newer agents will likely be investigated as the pathogenesis of NAFLD and fibrosis progression in  are further elucidated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27347998>Novel Action of Carotenoids on Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: Macrophage Polarization and Liver Homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease. It is characterized by a wide spectrum of hepatic changes, which may progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and cirrhosis. NAFLD is considered a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome; however, mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of NAFLD are still unclear. Resident and recruited macrophages are key players in the homeostatic function of the liver and in the progression of NAFLD to . Progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the polarized activation of macrophages. New NAFLD therapies will likely involve modification of macrophage polarization by restraining M1 activation or driving  activation. Carotenoids are potent antioxidants and anti-inflammatory micronutrients that have been used to prevent and treat NAFLD. In addition to their antioxidative action, carotenoids can regulate macrophage polarization and thereby halt the progression of . In this review, we summarize the molecular mechanisms of macrophage polarization and the function of liver macrophages/Kupffer cells in NAFLD. From our review, we propose that dietary carotenoids, such as β-cryptoxanthin and astaxanthin, be used to prevent or treat NAFLD through the regulation of macrophage polarization and liver homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10873077>Clinical and biological effects of intraperitoneal injections of recombinant interferon-gamma and recombinant interleukin 2 with or without tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in patients with ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma.</a></h2><p>To identify strategies that enhance tumor-specific immunity in patients with ovarian carcinoma, 22 patients received four to six doses of i.p. recombinant IFN-gamma (rIFN-gamma), 200 microg/ on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12, and i.p. recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL-2), either 6.0 x 10(5) IU/ (group A) or 1.0 x 10(5) IU/ (group B), on days 9, 10, and 11. Two patients in group A also received T-cell lines expanded from peritoneal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) obtained after i.p. rIFN-gamma/rIL-2 administration. Toxicity was manageable and included five nonhematological grade 3 or 4 events in 22 patients (23%). A patient had normalization of CA-125 values and a progression-free interval of 18 months, after receiving i.p. rIFN-gamma/rIL-2 without TILs. Another patient who received i.p. rIFN-gamma/rIL-2 plus TILs had stabilization of ascites and intra-abdominal tumors and >50% reduction in serum CA-125 values over 6 months. A third patient who received i.p. rIFN-gamma/rIL-2 had stabilization of intra-abdominal tumors and ascites accompanied by CA-125 values of 50 to 100 units over 6 months. T-cell lines for adoptive immunotherapy were developed for only 3 of 20 patients who were treated with rIFN-gamma/rIL-2. Large numbers of CD3- CD56+ adherent cells were expanded in rIL-2 in the remaining patients, precluding the development of T-cell lines. i.p. rIFN-gamma, either alone or followed by rIL-2, increased proportions of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I+ and class II+ tumor cells and increased HLA class I staining intensity on peritoneal carcinoma cells. i.p. rIFN-gamma plus rIL-2 also enhanced cytotoxic activity against Daudi and K562 cells and against allogeneic ovarian tumor cells. Increased cytotoxic activity was associated with an increase in the proportion of CD56+ cells. IFN-gamma and IL-2 transcripts were expressed more frequently after rIFN-gamma and rIL-2 treatment. In addition, the proportions of CD45RA+ (naive lymphocytes) were increased, and CD8+ DR+ lymphocytes were increased relative to CD8+ CD69+ cells, which were decreased. IL-10 concentrations in peritoneal fluids were increased after treatment with rIFN-gamma and the higher rIL-2 dosing (group A) but not in those treated with rIFN-gamma and the lower rIL-2 dosing (group B). These results demonstrated that patients with ovarian carcinoma can tolerate treatment with rIFN-gamma and rIL-2 and that rIFN-gamma alone or rIFN-gamma combined with rIL-2 enhances the expression of HLA class I and class II antigens on ovarian tumor cells, although immunosuppressive cytokines, such as transforming growth factor-beta and IL-10, may persist. Treatment with rIFN-gamma/rIL-2 i.p. did not facilitate the production of TIL-derived T-cell lines ex vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763757>Risk of obstructive sleep apnea with daytime sleepiness is associated with liver damage in non-morbidly obese patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>A high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) has been reported in severely obese patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but few studies have evaluated OSAS in non-morbidly obese NAFLD patients.To determine the prevalence of risk for OSAS with or without daytime sleepiness in non-morbidly obese patients with NAFLD and evaluate the association with the severity of liver damage.We considered 159 consecutive patients with histological NAFLD and body mass index (BMI) <35 Kg/, and 80 controls without ultrasonographic steatosis matched for age, sex, and BMI.

Galectin-3 (Gal-3), which is a β-galactoside binding protein, has been associated with liver fibrosis, but its role in NAFLD remains elusive. We investigated the expression of Gal-3 in liver resident cells and its potential association with liver damage in 40 children with biopsy-proven NAFLD. We found that several liver cells expressed Gal-3. The number of total Gal-3 positive cells decreased with the severity of disease and the cells were correlated with the presence of steatosis and the diagnosis of . CD68 macrophages expressed Gal-3 but the number CD68/Gal-3 positive cells was significantly reduced in patients diagnosed with steatosis and . Triple CD68/CD206/Gal-3, which represented the subpopulation of  macrophages, were mainly present in patients without , and clearly reduced in patients with steatosis and . On the contrary, the number of α-smooth muscle actin (SMA)/Gal-3 positive cells increased with the severity of fibrosis in children with NAFLD. Our data demonstrated that the number of Gal-3 positive cells was associated with tissue damage in different ways, which suggests a dual role of this protein in the pathogenesis of pediatric NAFLD, even if the role of Gal-3 deserves further studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914267>Macrophage p38α promotes nutritional steatohepatitis through M1 polarization.</a></h2><p>p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases are important inflammatory factors. p38α alteration has been implicated in both human and mouse inflammatory disease models. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the cell type-specific role of p38α in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ().Human liver tissues were obtained from 27 patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and 20 control individuals.  was established and compared between hepatocyte-specific p38α knockout (p38α), macrophage-specific p38α knockout (p38α) and wild-type (p38α) mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD), high-fat/high-cholesterol diet (HFHC), or methionine-and choline-deficient diet (MCD). p38 inhibitors were administered to HFHC-fed wild-type mice for disease treatment.p38α was significantly upregulated in the liver tissues of patients with NAFLD. Compared to p38α littermates, p38α mice developed significant nutritional steatohepatitis induced by HFD, HFHC or MCD. Meanwhile, p38α mice exhibited less severe steatohepatitis and insulin resistance than p38α mice in response to a HFHC or MCD. The effect of macrophage p38α in promoting steatohepatitis was mediated by the induction of pro-inflammatory factors (CXCL2, IL-1β, CXCL10 and IL-6) secreted by M1 macrophages and associated signaling pathways. p38α mice exhibited  anti-inflammatory polarization as demonstrated by increased CD45F4/80CD11bCD206  macrophages and enhanced arginase activity in liver tissues. Primary hepatocytes from p38α mice showed decreased steatosis and inflammatory damage. In a co-culture system, p38α deleted macrophages attenuated steatohepatitic changes in hepatocytes through decreased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, CXCL10 and IL-6), which mediate M1 macrophage polarization in p38α mice. Restoration of TNF-α, CXCL10 or IL-6 induced lipid accumulation and inflammatory responses in p38α hepatocytes co-cultured with p38α macrophages. Moreover, pharmacological p38 inhibitors suppressed HFHC-induced steatohepatitis.Macrophage p38α promotes the progression of steatohepatitis by inducing pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and M1 polarization. p38 inhibition protects against steatohepatitis. LAY SUMMARY: p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases are important inflammatory factors. In the present study, we demonstrated that p38α is upregulated in liver tissues of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases. Genetic deletion of p38α in macrophages led to ameliorated nutritional steatohepatitis in mice through decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and increased  macrophage polarization.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Study objectives were to confirm efficacy, and to characterise the physiology of CVBP re-warming in a porcine model.Sixteen pigs were randomised to conventional or CVBP re-warming. They were bled to a mean arterial pressure of 30 mmHg and cooled to 29 degrees C. A physiological analysis was recorded during resuscitation to normo-tension and re-warming back to 37 degrees C.CVBP animals re-warmed significantly faster: 85.0+16.4 min versus 217.4+49.3 min (p<0.0001). Activated clotting time was significantly elevated in both groups at 29 degrees C with a marked trend to normalise faster in CVBP pigs. The peak cardiac index (CI) was significantly lower (1.14+0.68 versus 4.83+1.50 L/(min ), while the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) was significantly higher (4239.9+1173.0 versus 1472.6+451.2 dyn x S x /cm5) with CVBP (p<0.001).CVBP is simple and very effective at re-warming hypothermic animals and may also reverse coagulopathy more quickly. Physiological derangements of elevated SVR and diminished CI require further study to elaborate underlying aetiology, and define optimal re-warming strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18525306>Preoperative capecitabine and accelerated intensity-modulated radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer: a phase II trial.</a></h2><p>A prospective phase II trial was conducted to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and pathologic response rate of preoperative capecitabine and accelerated synchronous integrated boost (SIB) intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.Consenting operable patients with stage II or III adenocarcinoma of the rectum received capecitabine (825 mg/ PO BID, 5 days/wk x 5 weeks) and SIB-IMRT delivering 55 Gy (2.2 Gy/fraction) to the gross tumor while simultaneously delivering 45 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction) to the regional lymph nodes and areas at risk for harboring microscopic disease. Total mesorectal excision followed 6 weeks later. A single pathologist analyzed the resected tumor's TNM stage and Mandard regression/response scores. The primary end point was pathologic complete response (pCR) rate.Ten subjects were enrolled, 2 of which were ineligible (1 screening failure and 1 unrelated cerebrovascular accident occurring early in treatment). The remaining 8 patients were evaluable. All 8 completed chemoradiation with strict compliance to the protocol schedule and then went on to surgical resection. At a median follow-up of 26 months (range, 15-40), all patients were alive without evidence of recurrent disease. The crude pCR rate was 38% with 50% achieving down-staging. Of 3 patients who had tumors within 5 cm of the anal verge, 2 underwent sphincter-sparing procedures. Grade 4 diarrhea occurred in 1 of 8 (13%) patients. The remaining toxicities were grade 1 or 2.Preoperative chemoradiation with capecitabine and SIB-IMRT is well tolerated and results in an encouraging pCR rate for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29669046>Nephrology comanagement and the quality of antibiotic prescribing in primary care for patients with chronic kidney disease: a retrospective cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>In primary care, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are frequently prescribed excessive doses of antibiotics relative to their kidney function. We examined whether nephrology comanagement is associated with improved prescribing in primary care.In a retrospective propensity score-matched cross-sectional study, we studied the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions by primary care physicians to Ontarians ≥66 years of age with CKD Stages 4 and 5 (estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73  not receiving dialysis) from 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2014. Comanagement was defined as having at least one outpatient visit with a nephrologist within the year prior to antibiotic prescription date. We compared the rate of appropriately dosed antibiotics in primary care between 3937 patients who were comanaged by a nephrologist and 3937 patients who were not.Only 1184 (30%) of 3937 noncomanaged patients had appropriately dosed antibiotic prescriptions prescribed by a primary care physician. Nephrology comanagement was associated with an increased likelihood that an appropriately dosed prescription was prescribed by a primary care physician; however, the magnitude of the effect was modest [1342/3937 (34%); odds ratio 1.20 (95% confidence interval 1.09-1.32); P < 0.001].The majority of antibiotics prescribed by primary care physicians are inappropriately dosed in CKD patients, whether or not a nephrologist is comanaging the patient.

Increased GSH transferase activity has been shown to underlie acquired resistance to several alkylating agents. Ethacrynic acid inhibits the isoenzymes of GSH transferase with 50% inhibitory concentration values ranging from 0.3 to 6.0 microM and has been shown to restore sensitivity to alkylating agents in drug-resistant animal tumor models. We entered 27 previously treated patients with advanced cancer on a study of ethacrynic acid (25 to 75 mg/ p.o. every 6 h for 3 doses) and thiotepa (30 to 55 mg/ i.v. 1 h after the second dose of ethacrynic acid). The major toxicity of ethacrynic acid was diuresis, which was observed at every dose level; in addition, severe metabolic abnormalities occurred at 75 mg/. At 50 mg/, the diuretic effects were manageable. Myelosuppression was the most important effect of the combination. Two of seven courses of ethacrynic acid, 50 mg/, and thiotepa, 55 mg/, were associated with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia. Nausea/vomiting greater than or equal to grade 2 was observed in 16% of courses. GSH transferase activity was assayed spectrophotometrically in the peripheral mononuclear cells of all patients. At each dose level, activity decreased following ethacrynic acid administration, with recovery by 6 h. Administration of ethacrynic acid, 50 mg/, resulted in a mean nadir of transferase activity of 37% of control. The pharmacokinetics of thiotepa and its principal metabolite TEPA were studied in 23 patients. The plasma disappearance of thiotepa fit a two-compartment open model with a terminal half-life of approximately 2 h. Plasma TEPA levels peaked at a mean of 2.16 h following thiotepa administration. The harmonic mean terminal half-life of TEPA was 10.4 h, and the TEPA area under the curve (AUC) did not increase with increasing thiotepa dose. The AUC of thiotepa was approximately twice, and the clearance about one-half, of the values obtained in a previous study of single agent thiotepa. The AUC of TEPA was lower than that previously observed. The data suggest that ethacrynic acid inhibits enzymes involved in the metabolic disposition of thiotepa, including its oxidative desulfuration to TEPA. The severity of the platelet toxicity was correlated with the AUC of thiotepa, but not with that of TEPA. This combination of thiotepa and ethacrynic acid will be tested further in Phase II trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23666886>Dietary modification dampens liver inflammation and fibrosis in obesity-related fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Alms1 mutant (foz/foz) mice develop hyperphagic obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and fatty liver (steatosis). High-fat (HF) feeding converts pathology from bland steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () with fibrosis, which leads to cirrhosis in humans.We sought to establish how dietary composition contributes to  pathogenesis.foz/foz mice were fed HF diet or chow 24 weeks, or switched HF to chow after 12 weeks. Serum ALT, NAFLD activity score (NAS), fibrosis severity, neutrophil, macrophage and apoptosis immunohistochemistry, uncoupling protein (UCP)2, ATP, NF-κB activation/expression of chemokines/adhesion molecules/fibrogenic pathways were determined.HF intake upregulated liver fatty acid and cholesterol transporter, CD36. Dietary switch expanded adipose tissue and decreased hepatomegaly by lowering triglyceride, cholesterol ester, free cholesterol and diacylglyceride content of liver. There was no change in lipogenesis or fatty acid oxidation pathways; instead, CD36 was suppressed. These diet-induced changes in hepatic lipids improved NAS, reduced neutrophil infiltration, normalized UCP2 and increased ATP; this facilitated apoptosis with a change in macrophage phenotype favoring  cells. Dietary switch also abrogated NF-κB activation and chemokine/adhesion molecule expression, and arrested fibrosis by dampening stellate cell activation.Reversion to a physiological dietary composition after HF feeding in foz/foz mice alters body weight distribution but not obesity. This attenuates  severity and fibrotic progression by suppressing NF-κB activation and reducing neutrophil and macrophage activation. However, adipose inflammation persists and is associated with continuing apoptosis in the residual fatty liver disease. Taken together, these findings indicate that other measures, such as weight reduction, may be required to fully reverse obesity-related .Copyright © 2013 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29126873>Dual role of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B in the progression and reversion of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in Western countries.

We investigated the impact of PTP1B deficiency during NAFLD, particularly in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (). features were evaluated in livers from wild-type (PTP1BWT) and PTP1B-deficient (PTP1BKO) mice fed methionine/choline-deficient diet (MCD) for 8 weeks. A recovery model was established by replacing MCD to chow diet (CHD) for 2-7 days. Non-parenchymal liver cells (NPCs) were analyzed by flow cytometry. Oval cells markers were measured in human and mouse livers with , and in oval cells from PTP1BWT and PTP1BKO mice.PTP1BWT mice fed MCD for 8 weeks exhibited , NPCs infiltration, and elevated Fgf21, Il6 and Il1b mRNAs. These parameters decreased after switching to CHD. PTP1B deficiency accelerated MCD-induced . Conversely, after switching to CHD, PTP1BKO mice rapidly reverted  compared to PTP1BWT mice in parallel to the normalization of serum triglycerides (TG) levels. Among NPCs, a drop in cytotoxic natural killer T (NKT) subpopulation was detected in PTP1BKO livers during recovery, and in these conditions  macrophage markers were up-regulated. Oval cells markers (EpCAM and cytokeratin 19) significantly increased during  only in PTP1B-deficient livers. HGF-mediated signaling and proliferative capacity were enhanced in PTP1BKO oval cells. In  patients, oval cells markers were also elevated.PTP1B elicits a dual role in  progression and reversion.

We aimed to evaluated the contribution of CD44 to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () development and liver injury in mouse models and in patients at various stages of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progression.The role of CD44 was evaluated in CD44 mice and after injections of an αCD44 antibody in wild-type mice challenged with a methionine- and choline-deficient diet (MCDD). In obese patients, hepatic CD44 (n=30 and 5  patients with a second liver biopsy after bariatric surgery) and serum sCD44 (n=64) were evaluated.Liver inflammation (including inflammatory foci number, macrophage and neutrophil infiltration and CCL2/CCR2 levels), liver injury and fibrosis strongly decreased in CD44 mice compared to wild-type mice on MCDD. CD44 deficiency enhanced the  polarization and strongly decreased the activation of macrophages by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hepatocyte damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and saturated fatty acids. Neutralization of CD44 in mice with steatohepatitis strongly decreased the macrophage infiltration and chemokine ligand (CCL)2 expression with a partial correction of liver inflammation and injury. In obese patients, hepatic CD44 was strongly upregulated in  patients (p=0.0008) and correlated with NAFLD activity score (NAS) (p=0.001), ballooning (p=0.003), alanine transaminase (p=0.005) and hepatic CCL2 (p<0.001) and macrophage marker CD68 (p<0.001) expression.

NAFLD in Korea is as closely associated with several components of metabolic syndrome including, obesity, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia as it is in Western countries. Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia may play a role in the pathogenesis of fatty liver in patients with normal body weight as well as in patients with obesity. And, obesity induced accumulation of fat in the adipose tissue leads to an imbalance in the regulation of adipokines, such as downregulation of adiponectin and upregulation of retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) and ghrelin. High BMI, the AST/ALT ratio, and ALT levels could be used to distinguish  from simple steatosis in Korean patients. In large number of NAFLD patients who underwent a voluntary medical checkup, even a small weight reduction was associated with improvements in their hepatic steatosis grade on ultrasonography, serum aminotransferase levels, and related metabolic abnormalities. Subjects with fatty liver disease should be advised to lose weight through lifestyle modifications. Small animal and human studies of treatment with PPAR agonists and betaine have been reported in the Korean literature. It is now acknowledged that NAFLD is the most common liver disease in Korea, largely due to the considerable increase in metabolic abnormalities such as obesity and diabetes. Future studies should continue to focus both on the pathogenesis and the treatment of NAFLD in order to accumulate more of our own data.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28687713>TLR9 is up-regulated in human and murine : pivotal role in inflammatory recruitment and cell survival.</a></h2><p>Background and aims TLR9 deletion protects against steatohepatitis due to choline-amino acid depletion and high-fat diet.

We report an affinity selection-mass spectrometry (AS-MS) method for protein-ligand affinity ranking and the classification of ligands by binding site. The method incorporates the following steps: (1) an affinity selection stage, where protein-binding compounds are selected from pools of ligands in the presence of varying concentrations of a competitor ligand, (2) a first chromatography stage to separate unbound ligands from protein-ligand complexes, and (3) a second chromatography stage to dissociate the ligands from the complexes for identification and quantification by MS. The ability of the competitor ligand to displace a target-bound library member, as measured by MS, reveals the binding site classification and affinity ranking of the mixture components. The technique requires no radiolabel incorporation or direct biochemical assay, no modification or immobilization of the compounds or target protein, and all reaction components, including any buffers or cofactors required for protein stability, are free in solution. We demonstrate the method for several compounds of wide structural variety against representatives of the most important protein classes in contemporary drug discovery, including novel ATP-competitive and allosteric inhibitors of the Akt-1 (PKB) and Zap-70 kinases, and previously undisclosed antagonists of the M(2) muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). The theoretical basis of the technique is analyzed mathematically, allowing quantitative estimation of binding affinities and, in the case of allosteric interaction, absolute determination of binding cooperativity.

Besides an extended liver and metabolic work-up, interleukin (IL) 1B, IL4, IL6, IL10, IL23, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) α and interferon (INF) γ were measured in plasma obtained from P and HV blood by means of multiplex immunoassay. The T helper (Th)1/Th2, the macrophage M1/ and the IL10/IL17a ratios were calculated.A decrease of the P-IL10/IL17-ratio and an increase of the P-M1/-ratio (p<0.05) were observed in  versus no- patients. A P-M1/-ratio increase was detected also in patients with portal hypertension in comparison with patients without it (p<0.05). Moreover diabetic patients showed an increase of the P-Th1/Th2-ratio in comparison with non-diabetic ones (p<0.05). The P-M1/ ratio positively correlated with steatosis grade (r = 0.39, p = 0.02) and insulin (r = 0.47, p = 0.003). The HV-M1/ ratio positively correlated with fasting insulin and Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient (r = 0.47, p = 0.003). IL6 correlated with the visceral fat amount (r = 0.36, p = 0.02). The P- and HV-IL10/IL17 ratios negatively correlated with fasting insulin (respectively r = -0.4, p = 0.005 and r = 0.4, p = 0.01).A proinflammatory cytokine state is associated with more disturbed metabolic, histological, and haemodynamic features in NAFLD obese patients. An increase of the M1/ ratio and a decrease of the IL10/IL17 ratio play a key role in this process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27049488>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in morbid obese patients: coffee consumption vs. disease severity.</a></h2><p>Obesity correlates with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and occurs in 90 to 100% of severely obese individuals (body mass index [BMI] > 35 kg/). Coffee consumption (CC) has been associated with reduced progression of fibrosis in both hepatitis C infection and NAFLD; however, this topic is still under discussion when this liver disease affects severely obese individuals.To assess the association between CC, insulin resistance (IR) and histological NAFLD morbid obese patients.Cross-sectional study, including obese individuals undergoing bariatric surgery, liver biopsy and histological diagnosis between September 2013 and August 2014. The patients were classified into 3 groups according to their weekly CC: 0- 239.9 mL; 240-2099.9 mL and ≥ 2100 mL.A total of 112 obese individuals were included (BMI = 41.9 ± 4.3 kg/), with a mean age of 34.7 ± 7.4 years; 68.6% were women. CC was reported by 72.3% of patients. There were no statistical significant differences between groups regarding the presence of IR (84.8% vs. 74.2% vs. 75.9%; p = 0.536). Progressively higher percentages of individuals with normal liver histology were observed (14.7% vs. 21.9% vs. 24.3%).

We measured microglial activation using histological and chemical measurement and recruitment of monocytes using histology and flow cytometry.The overexpression of CCL2 in the CNS induced significant activation of brain resident microglia. CD45 and major histocompatibility complex class II immunoreactivity significantly increased at the sites of CCL2 administration. Histological characterization of the microglial phenotype revealed the elevation of "classically activated" microglial markers, such as calgranulin B and IL-1β, as well as markers associated with "alternative activation" of microglia, including YM1 and arginase 1. The protein expression profile in the hippocampus demonstrated markedly increased levels of IL-6, GM-CSF and eotaxin (CCL-11) in response to CCL2, but no changes in the levels of other cytokines, including TNF-α and IFN-γ. Moreover, real-time PCR analysis confirmed increases in mRNA levels of gene transcripts associated with neuroinflammation following CCL2 overexpression. Finally, we investigated the chemotactic properties of CCL2 in vivo by performing adoptive transfer of bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) isolated from donor mice that ubiquitously expressed green fluorescent protein. Flow cytometry and histological analyses indicated that BMDCs extravasated into brain parenchyma and colabeled with microglial markers.Taken together, our results suggest that CCL2 strongly activates resident microglia in the brain. Both pro- and anti-inflammatory activation of microglia were prominent, with no bias toward the M1 or  phenotype in the activated cells. As expected, CCL2 overexpression actively recruited circulating monocytes into the CNS. Thus, CCL2 expression in mouse brain induces microglial activation and represents an efficient method for recruitment of peripheral macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10573167>Kinetic and phenotypic changes in murine lymphocytes infected with murine gammaherpesvirus-68 in vitro.</a></h2><p>Primary infection with murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV-68), as with other members of the gammaherpesvirus subfamily, is characterized by a lymphoproliferative phase. MHV-68 causes acute splenomegaly and an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome in which there is expansion of the CD8+ T cell subset. In long-term infections, MHV-68 is associated with lymphoma development. In order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the proliferative processes, the events following infection of murine splenocytes or purified murine B lymphocytes in vitro have been examined. MHV-68 infection prolonged the viability of murine splenocytes and stimulated cellular proliferation. Unlike Epstein-Barr virus and herpesvirus saimiri, MHV-68 did not cause growth transformation. Growth transformation did not occur even when cells with a predisposition to transformation were infected or when culture conditions were selected to enhance the viability of the cells. Following MHV-68 infection, the latency-associated viral tRNAs were transcribed. However, transcription of the other known latency-associated gene, , was not observed. In addition, there was no evidence of productive virus replication either by staining with antibodies specific for late virus antigens or by in situ hybridization for early and late mRNAs. In contrast to Epstein-Barr virus- and herpesvirus saimiri-infected lymphocytes, where episomal genomes are seen, Gardella gel analysis indicated that the primary lymphocytes infected by MHV-68 in vitro contained only linear virus DNA. This DNA was nuclease sensitive, indicating that, while MHV-68 was efficiently uncoated, its circularization in vitro was extremely inefficient.

We performed a phase I study of the alkylating agent thiotepa in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), with the goal of dose-escalation of thiotepa. Thiotepa was selected based on its capacity for dose escalation to more than 1 g/ in the marrow transplantation setting.The starting dose of thiotepa (75 mg/) was the highest dose evaluated in our previous phase I trial. Thirteen patients received 22 courses of thiotepa and GM-CSF. The dose of GM-CSF was 10 micrograms/kg subcutaneously daily in six patients and 5 micrograms/kg in seven patients.Three patients (23%) developed grade 3 to 4 neutropenia on the first course, with a recovery to more than 1000/mm3 in 4.7 days (mean). Recovery was as rapid with the 5 micrograms/kg as it was with the 10 micrograms/kg GM-CSF dose. Thrombocytopenia grade 3 to 4 affected seven of 13 (54%) patients in the first course; counts recovered to more than 50,000/mm3 in a median of 15 days. GM-CSF at either dose did not influence markedly the severity or duration of thrombocytopenia, and did not permit dose escalation of thiotepa. Among the seven patients who received a second cycle of treatment, six of seven experienced grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia that lasted a median of 15.5 days. Five had thrombocytopenia that lasted more than 35 days after one to three cycles of treatment. Plasma concentrations of thiotepa and tepa were measured by gas chromatography in eight patients. The plasma elimination of thiotepa fit a two-compartment open model with a harmonic mean terminal half-life of 2.44 hours. The mean total body clearance was 217.9 mL/min/, and the mean steady-state volume of distribution (Vdss) was 36.8 L/. The half-life of tepa was 7.98 hours, and the ratio of the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of tepa to that of thiotepa was 0.79.These data were consistent with our previous observations at this dose, and indicated that the severity of toxicity in these patients was not explained by aberrant pharmacokinetic indices. We conclude that, independent of effects on neutropenia, severe and cumulative platelet toxicity precludes further escalation of thiotepa dose despite the use of GM-CSF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14502318>The effects of sibutramine and orlistat on the ultrasonographic findings, insulin resistance and liver enzyme levels in obese patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () is frequent in obese subjects and has a relatively benign course; however, it may progress to cirrhosis.

Additionally, all patients were given a low caloric diet. Liver enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT and ALP), insulin resistance (analysed by HOMA) and hepatic ultrasound (US) findings were assessed at baseline and after 6 months.Both sibutramine and orlistat significantly reduced body weight (10.2 and 8.4%, respectively), insulin resistance (47 and 40%, respectively), AST (41 and 39%, respectively), ALT (59 and 58%, respectively), and GGT serum levels (27 and 25%, respectively).

The C-C chemokine receptor-2 (CCR2) has a crucial role in the recruitment of immune cells to WAT and liver, thereby promoting the inflammatory component of the disease. Herein, we examined whether intervention with propagermanium, an inhibitor of CCR2, would attenuate tissue inflammation and  development.Male C57BL/6J mice received a high-fat diet (HFD) for 0, 6, 12 and 24 weeks to characterize the development of early disease symptoms of , i.e. insulin resistance and WAT inflammation (by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and histology, respectively) and to define the optimal time point for intervention. In a separate study, mice were pretreated with HFD followed by propagermanium treatment (0.05% w/w) after 6 weeks (early intervention) or 12 weeks (late intervention).  was analyzed after 24 weeks of diet feeding.Insulin resistance in WAT developed after 6 weeks of HFD, which was paralleled by modest WAT inflammation. Insulin resistance and inflammation in WAT intensified after 12 weeks of HFD, and preceded  development. The subsequent CCR2 intervention experiment showed that early, but not late, propagermanium treatment attenuated insulin resistance. Only the early treatment significantly decreased Mcp-1 and CD11c gene expression in WAT, indicating reduced WAT inflammation. Histopathological analysis of liver demonstrated that propagermanium treatment decreased macrovesicular steatosis and tended to reduce lobular inflammation, with more pronounced effects in the early intervention group. Propagermanium improved the ratio between pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory () macrophages, quantified by CD11c and Arginase-1 gene expression in both intervention groups.Overall, early propagermanium administration was more effective to improve insulin resistance, WAT inflammation and  compared to late intervention. These data suggest that therapeutic interventions for  directed at the MCP-1/CCR2 pathway should be initiated early.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30835899>Iron alters macrophage polarization status and leads to steatohepatitis and fibrogenesis.</a></h2><p>We have previously demonstrated that iron overload in hepatic reticuloendothelial system cells (RES) is associated with severe nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () and advanced fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Recruited myeloid-derived macrophages have gained a pivotal position as drivers of  progression and fibrosis. In this study, we used bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from C57Bl6 mice as surrogates for recruited macrophages and examined the effect of iron on macrophage polarization. Treatment with iron (ferric ammonium citrate, FAC) led to increased expression levels of M1 markers: CCL2, CD14, iNOS, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α; it also increased protein levels of CD68, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 by flow cytometry. This effect could be reversed by desferrioxamine, an iron chelator. Furthermore, iron loading of macrophages in the presence of IL-4 led to the down-regulation of  markers: arginase-1, Mgl-1, and -specific transcriptional regulator, KLF4. Iron loading of macrophages with IL-4 also resulted in reduced phosphorylation of STAT6, another transcriptional regulator of  activation. Dietary iron overload of C57Bl6 mice led to hepatic macrophage M1 activation. Iron overload also stimulated hepatic fibrogenesis. Histologic analysis revealed that iron overload resulted in steatohepatitis. Furthermore, NAFLD patients with hepatic RES iron deposition had increased hepatic gene expression levels of M1 markers, IL-6, IL-1β, and CD40 and reduced gene expression of an  marker, TGM2, relative to patients with hepatocellular iron deposition pattern. We conclude that iron disrupts the balance between M1/ macrophage polarization and leads to macrophage-driven inflammation and fibrogenesis in NAFLD.©2019 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11454190>Chronic hepatitis C and superimposed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Hepatitis C and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFL) are the two most common forms of liver disease in the United States.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, and its associated risk factors on HCV-related fibrosis.Patients with untreated, biopsy-proven, chronic hepatitis C (6/97-3/99) were included. Clinical and demographic data at the time of liver biopsy were obtained from chart review and verified by telephone survey. One hepatopathologist reviewed all pathologic specimens, using the modified histological activity index score and the Ishak staging for fibrosis and a NAFL pathologic protocol.One hundred and seventy patients with hepatitis C were included [age: 48.7+/-9.33 (years), body mass index (BMI): 28.1+/-5.7 (kg/) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM): 14%].

Angiogenesis is initiated by the detachment of pericytes (PCs) from vessels in AT. This process is necessary for the development of AT in obesity. The detachment is caused by excessive platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) derived from M1-macrophages (Mφ) infiltrating obese AT. On the other hand, AT of tamoxifen-induced systemic PDGF receptor-β knockout mice showed decreased detachment of PCs from vessels in obesity, thereby attenuating hypertrophy of AT mediated by neoangiogenesis, resulting in protection from the development of chronic AT inflammation and systemic insulin resistance. The selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) inhibitor eplerenone (Ep) suppresses chronic inflammation in fat and the liver, improves glucose and lipid metabolism, and inhibits body weight and fat mass gain in mice fed a high-fat diet. As a novel mechanism, Ep increases energy expenditure and suppresses fat accumulation, thereby controlling the polarity of visceral AT Mφ from inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory  dominant. In addition, Ep directly inhibits the activation of signals 1 and 2 of NLRP3-inflammasomes in Mφ, which is an inflammatory mechanism closely involved in the development of . Thus, we propose novel therapeutic approaches to . Inhibition of PDGF receptor-β signaling prevents AT hypertrophy by regulating AT angiogenesis, and MR inhibitors directly suppress chronic inflammation in the AT and liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19344467>Outcome after liver transplantation for  cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () associated cirrhosis is an increasing indication for liver transplant (LT). The aim of this study was to determine outcome and poor predictive factors after LT for  cirrhosis. We analyzed patients undergoing LT from 1997 to 2008 at a single center.  was diagnosed on histopathology. LT recipients with hepatitis C, alcoholic or cholestatic liver disease and cryptogenic cirrhosis acted as matched controls. Ninety-eight LT recipients were identified with  cirrhosis. Compared to controls,  patients had a higher BMI (mean 32.3 kg/), and were more likely to be diabetic and hypertensive. Mortality after transplant was similar between  patients and controls but there was a tendency for higher earlier mortality in  patients (30-day mortality 6.1%, 1-year mortality 21.4%). Sepsis accounted for half of all deaths in  patients, significantly higher than controls.  patients > or =60 years, BMI > or =30 kg/ with diabetes and hypertension (HTN) had a 50% 1-year mortality. In conclusion, patients undergoing LT for  cirrhosis have a similar outcome to patients undergoing LT for other indications. The combination of older age, higher BMI, diabetes and HTN are associated with poor outcome after LT. Careful consideration is warranted before offering LT to these high-risk patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29473277>Formation of p62-positive inclusion body is associated with macrophage polarization in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Hepatic inclusion composed of autophagy-specific substrate p62 is one of the histological features of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and can be a precursor to hepatic carcinogenesis. The expression of p62 was enhanced by not only autophagic dysfunction but also oxidative stress and inflammation. M1/ phenotypic balance of macrophages plays a pivotal role in the progression of NAFLD. We evaluated the correlation between macrophage polarization and the formation of p62 aggregation in NAFLD.Liver biopsy specimens from NAFLD patients were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining for M1 macrophage marker CD11c,  macrophage marker CD163, and p62/SQSTM1 (p62). The histological severity of NAFLD is assessed by a NAFLD activity score (NAS). The number of autophagic vesicles in hepatocytes was visualized and counted by using transmission electron microscopy.The aggregation of p62 was undetectable in control, whereas hepatocytes with p62 aggregation were observed in approximately 88% of NAFLD specimens. The number of hepatocytes with p62 aggregation was positively correlated with the number of autophagic vesicles, serum alanine aminotransferase, NAS, fibrosis, and the number of CD11c-positive cells, but not CD163-positive cells. Assembly of CD11c-positive cells was observed around hepatocytes with p62 aggregation. The ratio of CD11c/CD163-positive macrophages was significantly associated with the formation of p62 aggregation.These findings indicate that chronic inflammation by M1-polarization of macrophages contributes to the disease progression from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in concert with autophagic dysfunction.© 2018 The Japan Society of Hepatology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26077675>Progression of non-alcoholic steatosis to steatohepatitis and fibrosis parallels cumulative accumulation of danger signals that promote inflammation and liver tumors in a high fat-cholesterol-sugar diet model in mice.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming a pandemic. While multiple 'hits' have been reported to contribute to NAFLD progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), fibrosis and liver cancer, understanding the natural history of the specific molecular signals leading to hepatocyte damage, inflammation and fibrosis, is hampered by the lack of suitable animal models that reproduce disease progression in humans. The purpose of this study was first, to develop a mouse model that closely mimics progressive NAFLD covering the spectrum of immune, metabolic and histopathologic abnormalities present in human disease; and second, to characterize the temporal relationship between sterile/exogenous danger signals, inflammation, inflammasome activation and NAFLD progression.Male C57Bl/6 mice were fed a high fat diet with high cholesterol and a high sugar supplement (HF-HC-HSD) for 8, 27, and 49 weeks and the extent of steatosis, liver inflammation, fibrosis and tumor development were evaluated at each time point.The HF-HC-HSD resulted in liver steatosis at 8 weeks, progressing to steatohepatitis and early fibrosis at 27 weeks, and steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and tumor development at 49 weeks compared to chow diet. Steatohepatitis was characterized by increased levels of MCP-1, TNFα, IL-1β and increased liver  histological score. We found increased serum levels of sterile danger signals, uric acid and HMGB1, as early as 8 weeks, while endotoxin and ATP levels increased only after 49 weeks. Increased levels of these sterile and microbial danger signals paralleled upregulation and activation of the multiprotein complex inflammasome. At 27, 49 weeks of HF-HC-HSD, activation of M1 macrophages and loss of  macrophages as well as liver fibrosis were present. Finally, similar to human , liver tumors occurred in 41% of mice in the absence of cirrhosis and livers expressed increased p53 and detectable AFP.HF-HC-HSD over 49 weeks induces the full spectrum of liver pathophysiologic changes that characterizes the progression of NAFLD in humans. NAFLD progression to , fibrosis and liver tumor follows progressive accumulation of sterile and microbial danger signals, inflammasome activation, altered M1/ cell ratios that likely contribute to  progression and hepatic tumor formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16490772>Discovery and characterization of orthosteric and allosteric muscarinic  acetylcholine receptor ligands by affinity selection-mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Screening assays using target-based affinity selection coupled with high-sensitivity detection technologies to identify small-molecule hits from chemical libraries can provide a useful discovery approach that complements traditional assay systems. Affinity selection-mass spectrometry (AS-MS) is one such methodology that holds promise for providing selective and sensitive high-throughput screening platforms. Although AS-MS screening platforms have been used to discover small-molecule ligands of proteins from many target families, they have not yet been used routinely to screen integral membrane proteins. The authors present a proof-of-concept study using size exclusion chromatography coupled to AS-MS to perform a primary screen for small-molecule ligands of the purified muscarinic  acetylcholine receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor. AS-MS is used to characterize the binding mechanisms of 2 newly discovered ligands. NGD-3350 is a novel -specific orthosteric antagonist of  function. NGD-3366 is an allosteric ligand with binding properties similar to the allosteric antagonist W-84, which decreases the dissociation rate of N-methyl-scopolamine from the  receptor. Binding properties of the ligands discerned from AS-MS assays agree with those from in vitro biochemical assays. The authors conclude that when used with appropriate small-molecule libraries, AS-MS may provide a useful high-throughput assay system for the discovery and characterization of all classes of integral membrane protein ligands, including allosteric modulators.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25816629>[An analysis of the efficacy of low-calorie and isocaloric diets in obese patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis].</a></h2><p>Diet modification is widely used for the treatment of non.alcoholic steatohepatitis ().

Caloric restriction was achieved by decreasing consumption of carbohydrates and fat in LCD, whereas for ICD the caloric consumption was established according to the recommended daily values for proteins, fat and carbohydrates for ideal BMI for every patient. Blood chemistry and body composition were assessed at baseline and after 1 mo of prescribed diets. Compliance for the diet was also evaluated using previously validated questionnaire. After 1 mo of dietetic interventions total body mass and lean mass significantly decreased in both groups, but in LCD group it was significantly more prominent decrease in compare to ICD group (9,3±1,8 vs 6,2±1,7 kg and 6,6±0,4 vs 1,4±0,6 kg, p<0,05), whereas fat mass decreased better in ICD group (4,8±0,7 vs 2, 7±0,8kg, p<0,05).

Methionine/choline-deficient diet (MCD) model; 16-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed with an MCD for 2 weeks. Those hepatic MDSCs were evaluated by flow cytometry and immunohistochemically.Both MSG and MCD mice exhibited greater numbers of hepatic lipid droplets than 18-week-old male control mice. Hepatocellular ballooning was obvious in MSG, whereas inflammatory cell infiltration were apparent in MCD mice. CD11b, CD115, and Gr-1-positive hepatic MDSCs were increased in both models but higher in MCD mice, and demonstrated higher expression of an  macrophage marker CD206 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in MSG compared to MCD mice. Degree of reactive oxygen species production was evaluated using the DCFDA MFI values, which were significantly elevated in hepatic MDSCs from MCD mice. MSG mouse livers demonstrated Gr-1 positive cell accumulation around lipid droplets, mimicking crown-like structures in adipose tissues. In contrast, hepatic Gr-1 positive cells were primarily located in inflammatory cell aggregates in MCD mice.These results suggest that hepatic fatty changes promote MDSC accumulation, and inflammatory changes induce phenotypic and functional alteration in hepatic MDSCs in  mouse models.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15526543>The risk factors of fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () can be a severe progressive liver disease leading to the development of cirrhosis.

The patients had no alcoholic, viral, autoimmune, drug induced or genetic liver disease. The fibrosis and necroinflammatory activity was associated with clinico-biochemical parameters and with oxidative stress. The clinical and biochemical parameters consist of: age, sex, body mass index (BMI), serum glucose, tryglycerides, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and serum iron study (transferring saturation and ferritin). Liver iron overload was assessed by Pearls'staining and graded in four classes. The oxidative stress was evaluated by the levels of serum malon-dyaldehide (MDA) and serum total gluthatione (GSI4).Septal fibrosis was present in 30 patients (27%) including cirrhosis in 4 patients (5%).

Hepatocytes and macrophages represent two major sources of hepatic inflammation during  pathogenesis, contributing to excessive synthesis of proinflammatory mediators. The epigenetic mechanism that accounts for the activation of hepatocytes and macrophages in this process remains obscure. Here, we report that compared to wild-type littermates, mice with a deficiency in the histone H3K9 methyltransferase suppressor of variegation 39 homolog 2 (Suv39h2, knockout) exhibited a less severe form of  induced by feeding with a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. Pro- stimuli increased Suv39h2 expression in cell culture, in mice, and in human livers. In hepatocytes, Suv39h2 bound to the Sirt1 gene promoter and repressed Sirt1 transcription. Suv39h2 deficiency normalized Sirt1 expression, allowing nuclear factor kappa B/p65 to become hypoacetylated and thus dampening nuclear factor kappa B-dependent transcription of proinflammatory mediators. In macrophages, Suv39h2-mediated repression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma transcription favored a proinflammatory M1 phenotype over an anti-inflammatory  phenotype, thereby elevating hepatic inflammation.Suv39h2 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of inflammatory response in hepatocytes and macrophages, contributing to  pathogenesis.

Clinical studies have demonstrated an association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and both inflammation and fibrosis in , but the mechanism has not been identified. In this study, we use  modeling to examine the impact of intermittent hypoxia on the liver. Hepatocyte, stellate cell, and macrophage cell lines were exposed to intermittent or sustained hypoxia. Candidate genes associated with inflammation, fibrosis, and lipogenesis were analyzed. Circulating cytokines were assessed in human serum of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Intermittent hypoxia results in significant induction of interleukin (IL)-6 expression in both hepatocytes and macrophages. The increase in IL-6 expression was independent of hypoxia inducible factor 1 induction but appeared to be in part related to antioxidant response element and nuclear factor kappa B activation. Mature microRNA 365 (miR-365) has been demonstrated to regulate IL-6 expression, and we found that miR-365 expression was decreased in the setting of intermittent hypoxia. Furthermore, macrophage cell lines showed polarization to an M1 but not  phenotype. Finally, we found a trend toward higher circulating levels of IL-6 in patients with OSA and . : Intermittent hypoxia acts as a potent proinflammatory stimulus, resulting in IL-6 induction and M1 macrophage polarization. Increased IL-6 expression may be due to both induction of antioxidant response element and nuclear factor kappa B as well as inhibition of miR-365 expression.

The numbers of M1-macrophages (reacting to CD68 and Iba1) and - macrophages (reacting to CD163, CD204 and Gal-3) were considerably greater in Adp-positive PLs. Expressions for both M1 (TNF-α, MCP-1, and Iba1)- and  (IL-4, TGF-β1, Gal-3, and Hsp25)-related factors were markedly higher in Adp-positive PLs at PFI week 25.

In this study, we investigated the relationship between MetS and  in severely obese subjects.A total of 111 non-alcoholic obese patients who underwent laparoscopic bariatric surgery (BMI 45.4 +/- 5.7 kg/) were enrolled from February to September 2004 in a referral center in North Taiwan. MetS and its individual components were defined using the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criteria. Based on liver biopsy during surgery, subjects were classified into either having  or not. The relationship among , adiponectin, insulin resistance, MetS and its individual components was examined using a multivariate logistic regression analysis.The prevalence of  and MetS in these subjects was 79.3% and 68.5%, respectively. Using a multivariate logistic regression analysis with  as the outcome variable, odds ratio (OR) of  for subjects with MetS versus without MetS was 2.96 (95% CI = 1.14-7.68) adjusted for age, gender, and BMI. Also, high blood pressure (OR = 2.97, 1.31-6.73) and high fasting glucose (OR = 2.94, 1.13-7.67) were independently associated with  after adjustment for age, gender, and BMI. Insulin resistance measured as HOMA-IR and serum adiponectin level were not significantly different between the  and non- group.MetS and  were common in severely obese Taiwanese adults.

The roles of noncoding RNAs in  are less known. We aim to elucidate the function of miR-141/200c in diet-induced . WT and miR-141/200c-/- mice were fed a methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet for 2 weeks to assess markers of steatosis, liver injury, and inflammation. Hepatic miR-141 and miR-200c RNA levels were highly induced in human patients with  fatty liver and in WT MCD mice. miR-141/200c-/- MCD mice had reduced liver weights and triglyceride (TG) levels, which was associated with increased microsomal TG transfer protein (MTTP) and PPARα but reduced SREBP1c and FAS expression. Inflammation was attenuated and F4/80 macrophage activation was suppressed in miR-141/200c-/- mice, as evidenced by decreased serum aminotransferases and IL-6 and reduced hepatic proinflammatory, neutrophil, and profibrotic genes. Treatment with LPS in BM-derived macrophages isolated from miR-200c/141-/- mice polarized macrophages toward the  antiinflammatory state by increasing Arg1 and IL-10 levels while decreasing the M1 marker iNOS. In addition, elevated phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK), p-AKT, and p-GSK3β and diminished TLR4 and p-mTOR/p-4EBP1 proteins were observed. Lipidomics and metabolomics revealed alterations of TG and phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid species by miR-141/200c deficiency. In summary, miR-141/200c deficiency diminished -associated hepatic steatosis and inflammation by reprogramming lipid and inflammation signaling pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27493111> High prevalence of undiagnosed liver cirrhosis and advanced fibrosis in type 2 diabetic patients.</a></h2><p> Background. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at risk for developing end-stage liver disease due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), the aggressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Data on prevalence of advanced fibrosis among T2DM patients is scarce.To evaluate prevalence of steatosis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis using non-invasive methods in T2DM patients.145 consecutive T2DM patients (> 55 years-old) were prospectively recruited. Presence of cirrhosis and advanced fibrosis was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) respectively. Exclusion criteria included significant alcohol consumption, markers of viral hepatitis infection or other liver diseases. Results are expressed in percentage or median (interquartile range).52.6% of patients were women, the median age was 60 years old (57-64), mean BMI was 29.6 ± 4.7 kg/ and diabetes duration was 7.6 ± 6.9 years. A high prevalence of liver steatosis (63.9%), advanced fibrosis assessed by NFS (12.8%) and evidence of liver cirrhosis in MRI (6.0%) was observed. In a multivariate analysis GGT > 82 IU/L (P = 0.004) and no alcohol intake (P = 0.032) were independently associated to advanced fibrosis.A high frequency of undiagnosed advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis was observed in non-selected T2DM patients.

CRP170 was replaced by surface-labeled bands ranging in size from approximately 50 to 170 kD. In this study, mAb 6E7 was used to isolate a 1-kb portion of the CRP170 gene (-1) from a lambda gt 11 expression library. The -1 clone hybridized to a 5.4-kb transcript from isolates expressing CRP170 but did not hybridize to RNA from antigenic variants. Evidence was found for frequent rearrangements at the CRP170 gene locus. DNA sequencing of the -1 clone revealed the presence of long tandem repeats.

TMTX has a mechanism of action similar to that of methotrexate (MTX); however, unlike MTX, TMTX is not primarily dependent on renal excretion. Patients were conditioned for transplant with cyclophosphamide, anti-thymocyte globulin, and total body irradiation. TMTX, 10 mg/ i.v., was administered on days 1, 3, 6, 11, 18, 25, 32, and 39 after transplant. CsA, 1.5 mg/kg i.v., was administered every 12 hr beginning on day-1. Eleven patients with hematologic malignancies or aplastic anemia (median age = 34 yr) received TMTX. Toxicity assessed included nausea, vomiting, fever, rash, time to myeloid and platelet engraftment, mucositis, and hepatic and renal dysfunction. Toxicity of TMTX was not different from that observed with MTX in a similar patient population. One patient died on day 16 before engraftment. The other 10 patients all engrafted and all developed acute GVHD at a median time of 11 days after transplant. The major manifestation of acute GVHD was in the skin, and all but one patient responded to primary therapy with corticosteroids. Seven patients have survived a median of 447 days after transplant. No significant toxicity from TMTX was observed. Further trials are warranted to define the role of TMTX in marrow transplantation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19473437>Adiponectin prevents progression of steatohepatitis in mice by regulating oxidative stress and Kupffer cell phenotype polarization.</a></h2><p>We reported previously that hypoadiponectinemia enhances hepatic oxidative stress and accelerates progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () in mice. However, the precise mechanism and preventive effects of adiponectin on  remain unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of adiponectin on steatohepatitis using adiponectin-knockout (KO) mice and adenovirus-mediated adiponectin expression system.We used male KO mice and C57BL6/J (WT) mice fed methionine choline-deficient (MCD)-diet as a steatohepatitis model. Liver histology, hepatic oxidative stress markers, and hepatic gene expression levels were investigated. In addition, Hepa 1-6 cells, a mouse liver cell line, were cultured with or without recombinant adiponectin, and gene expressions were investigated by real-time RT-PCR.After 2-week feeding of MCD diet, hepatic steatosis was enhanced and plasma alanine aminotransferase elevated in KO mice than in WT mice. In KO mice liver, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances increased, glutathione levels decreased, and mRNA expression levels of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase-1) downregulated. Adenovirus-mediated adiponectin expression prevented these changes in KO mice. Moreover, Kupffer cell infiltration was enhanced and mRNA levels of anti-inflammatory  macrophage markers (interleukin-10, arginase-1) were decreased in KO mice liver. In the in vitro study, adiponectin significantly increased catalase gene expression in Hepa 1-6 cells.Lack of adiponectin enhanced, and adiponectin administration prevented steatohepatitis progression in mice. These changes were due to the anti-oxidative effects of adiponectin, and its effects on Kupffer cells recruitment and phenotype polarization. Augmentation of adiponectin effects could be a useful preventive approach for  progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20402293>Predictors of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in patients with elevated alanine aminotransferase activity.</a></h2><p>Incidence of obesity and hepatic steatosis is increasing worldwide. Almost one quarter of western countries population suffer from non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and predictors of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () in patients with unexplained alanine aminotransferase activity elevation (ALT), and therefore avoid unnecessary biopsies in cases of simple steatosis. Earlier studies provided different results and have not answered the question how to distinguish  from simple steatosis. Ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MRI) can detect steatosis with great sensitivity level, but not . This study included 50 patients (18 women and 32 men) with mean age 43 +/- 9 years, and with defined selected biochemical, anthropometric and hormone biomarkers. The average BMI was 27.1 +/- 3.81 (kg/), insulin resistance HOMA IR 3.89 +/-3.81. All patients underwent liver biopsy and  was staged by  activity score (NAS) from 1 to 8. Results are compared to pathohistological finding as relevant method. The results show that 90% of patients (n=45) had NAFLD (minimal stage at least), and 15 (30%) had nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ().

Mice were fed with high-fat diet (HFD) or methionine-choline 4-deficient diet (MCD) and injected intraperitoneally with IL-33. Both mRNA and protein expression levels of IL-33 and ST2 were up-regulated in the livers of mice fed with HFD or MCD. Treatment with IL-33 attenuated diet-induced hepatic steatosis and reduced activities of ALT in serum, as well as ameliorated HFD-induced systemic insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, while aggravated hepatic fibrosis in diet-induced . Furthermore, treatment with IL-33 can also promote Th2 response and  macrophage activation and beneficial modulation on expression profiles of fatty acid metabolism genes in livers. ST2 deficiency did not affect hepatic steatosis and fibrosis when fed with controlling diet. IL-33 did not affect diet-induced hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in ST2 knockout mice. Meanwhile, in the livers of patients with , IL-33 was mainly located in hepatic sinusoid, endothelial cells, and hepatic stellate cells. The mRNA expression level of IL-33 and ST2 was elevated with the progression of . In conclusion, treatment with IL-33 attenuated diet-induced hepatic steatosis, but aggravated hepatic fibrosis, in a ST2-dependent manner.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30896956>An assessment of bacterial overgrowth and translocation in the non-alcoholic fatty liver of patients with morbid obesity.</a></h2><p>small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and bacterial translocation across the intestinal wall have been allegedly associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL). Our goal was to study such alleged association in morbidly obese patients.patients with morbid obesity were consecutively included prior to bariatric surgery. Exclusion criteria included normal liver biopsy, other causes of liver disease, and duodenal mucosal atrophy. A gastroscopy was performed for duodenal aspirate culture and duodenal biopsy, and peripheral venous blood was drawn to assess lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS-binding protein (LBP) levels. A liver biopsy was carried out during surgery.seventy-one patients were included; 26 were excluded because of normal liver biopsy. Forty-five had NAFL. Eighteen were male, mean age was 45.8 years (22-69), and BMI was 47.8 kg/ (37-58). A total of 25% had SIBO in their duodenal aspirate culture. There was statistical significance for the association of LBP levels and SIBO with steatosis grade (p < 0.05 and p = 0.077, respectively). There was no statistical association with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () index, but a trend towards association was found.

We conducted a pilot study for the following reasons: (1) to test the hypothesis that a combination of an antioxidant (vitamin E) and an insulin sensitizer (pioglitazone) would be superior to vitamin E alone for the treatment of , and (2) to define the effects of these interventions on insulin-sensitive metabolic functions and correlate the effects with changes in liver histology.A randomized prospective trial was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of vitamin E alone (400 IU/day) vs. vitamin E (400 IU/day) and pioglitazone (30 mg/day) in nondiabetic, noncirrhotic subjects with . Metabolic functions were assessed by a 2-step, hyperinsulinemic (10 and 40 mU//min) euglycemic clamp.A total of 10 patients were randomized to each arm. Two patients on combination therapy discontinued treatment; one because of pregnancy and the other because of hepatotoxicity. Treatment with vitamin E only produced a significant decrease in steatosis (mean grade, 2.2 vs. 1.4; P < .02). Compared with baseline, combination therapy produced a significant decrease in steatosis (mean, 2.3 vs. 1; P < .002), cytologic ballooning (1.3 vs. 0.2; P < .01), Mallory's hyaline (0.7 vs. 0.2; P < .04), and pericellular fibrosis (1.2 vs. 0.6; P < .03). Although vitamin E had no significant effects, combination therapy produced a significant increase in metabolic clearance of glucose and a decrease in fasting free fatty acid (FFA) and insulin. The decrease in fasting FFA and insulin independently predicted improvement in hepatic steatosis and cytologic ballooning.A combination of vitamin E and pioglitazone produces a greater improvement in  histology. The improvement in steatosis and cytologic ballooning are related to treatment-associated decreases in fasting FFA and insulin levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30855276>A maresin 1/RORα/12-lipoxygenase autoregulatory circuit prevents inflammation and progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Retinoic acid-related orphan receptor α (RORα) is considered a key regulator of polarization in liver macrophages that is closely related to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () pathogenesis. However, hepatic microenvironments that support the function of RORα as a polarity regulator were largely unknown. Here, we identified maresin 1 (MaR1), a docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) metabolite with a function of specialized proresolving mediator, as an endogenous ligand of RORα. MaR1 enhanced the expression and transcriptional activity of RORα and thereby increased the  polarity of liver macrophages. Administration of MaR1 protected mice from high-fat diet-induced  in a RORα-dependent manner. Surprisingly, RORα increased the level of MaR1 through transcriptional induction of 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), a key enzyme in MaR1 biosynthesis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that modulation of 12-LOX activity enhanced the protective function of DHA against .

This study aimed to investigate whether honokiol could prevent  induced by high-cholesterol and high-fat (CL) diet in mice and the possible mechanism involved.Mice were fed with CL diet for 12 weeks to establish a  model; honokiol (0.02% w/w in diet) was added to evaluate its effect on . Murine peritoneal macrophages, RAW264.7 and ANA-1 cells, were used to explore the possible mechanisms of honokiol on macrophage polarization.Mice developed  after fed with CL diet for 12 weeks. Honokiol supplementation alleviated insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis induced by CL diet. Immunohistochemistry showed that honokiol induced more  macrophages in livers compared with CL diet alone. Honokiol decreased M1 marker genes (TNFα and MCP-1) and increased  marker gene (YM-1, IL-10, IL-4R and IL-13) expression in mice liver compared with CL diet. Moreover, treatment with honokiol lowered alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in serum and preserved liver from lipid peroxidation, evidenced by lowered hepatic malondialdehyde level. Honokiol has antioxidant function, as honokiol upregulated hepatic glutathione and superoxide dismutase level and downregulated hepatic CYP2E1 protein level. Hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and its target genes were upregulated by honokiol. Furthermore, honokiol (10 μM) treatment in mouse peritoneal cells, RAW264.7 cells and ANA-1 cells, led to  macrophage polarization, whereas a PPARγ antagonist, GW9662, abolished this effect of honokiol.Honokiol can attenuate CL diet-induced  and the mechanism in which possibly is polarizing macrophages to  phenotype via PPARγ activation.© 2017 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25419656>Longitudinal assessment of high blood pressure in children with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects 9.6% of children and may put these children at elevated risk of high blood pressure and subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Therefore, we sought to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for high blood pressure in children with NAFLD.Cohort study performed by the NIDDK  Clinical Research Network. There were 484 children with NAFLD ages 2 to 17 at enrollment; 382 children were assessed both at enrollment and 48 weeks afterwards. The main outcomes were high blood pressure at baseline and persistent high blood pressure at both baseline and 48 weeks.Prevalence of high blood pressure at baseline was 35.8% and prevalence of persistent high blood pressure was 21.4%. Children with high blood pressure were significantly more likely to have worse steatosis than children without high blood pressure (mild 19.8% vs. 34.2%, moderate 35.0% vs. 30.7%, severe 45.2% vs. 35.1%; P = 0.003). Higher body mass index, low-density lipoprotein, and uric acid were independent risk factors for high blood pressure (Odds Ratios: 1.10 per kg/, 1.09 per 10 mg/dL, 1.25 per mg/dL, respectively). Compared to boys, girls with NAFLD were significantly more likely to have persistent high blood pressure (28.4% vs.18.9%; P = 0.05).In conclusion, NAFLD is a common clinical problem that places children at substantial risk for high blood pressure, which may often go undiagnosed.

We have carried out comparative studies of another herpesvirus, murine herpesvirus 76 (MHV-76), which was isolated at the same time as MHV-68 but from a different murid host, the yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis). Molecular analyses revealed that the MHV-76 genome is essentially identical to that of MHV-68, except for deletion of 9,538 bp at the left end of the unique region. MHV-76 is therefore a deletion mutant that lacks four genes unique to MHV-68 (M1, , M3, and M4) as well as the eight viral tRNA-like genes. Replication of MHV-76 in cell culture was identical to that of MHV-68. However, following infection of mice, MHV-76 was cleared more rapidly from the lungs. In line with this, there was an increased inflammatory response in lungs with MHV-76. Splenomegaly was also significantly reduced following MHV-76 infection, and much less latent MHV-76 was detected in the spleen. Nevertheless, MHV-76 maintained long-term latency in the lungs and spleen. We utilized a cosmid containing the left end of the MHV-68 genome to reinsert the deleted sequence into MHV-76 by recombination in infected cells, and we isolated a rescuant virus designated MHV-76(cA8+)4 which was ostensibly genetically identical to MHV-68. The growth properties of the rescuant in infected mice were identical to those of MHV-68. These results demonstrate that genetic elements at the left end of the unique region of the MHV-68 genome play vital roles in host evasion and are critical to the development of splenic pathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29729177>Clinical and pathogenetic features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis for comorbidity with bronchial asthma on the background of obesity.</a></h2><p>Introduction: The comorbid flow of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and bronchial asthma (BA) on the background of obesity is often recently drawn to the attention of both practitioners and researchers . The aim of our study was to study the changes in the functional state of the liver and the dependence of the external respiration function in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in combination with bronchial asthma and obesity.Materials and methods: The study was attended by 50 people aged from 30 to 50 years (average age 42 years), of which 40% were men and 60% women. Of these, 30 patients with obesity I degree (BMI greater than 30 kg / ) non-alcoholic steatohepatitis was detected, and in 20 of patients, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis was combined with obesity of the I degree and persistent bronchial asthma of moderate severity. Duration of the disease was from 2 to 6 years. The control group consisted of 20 practically healthy persons (PHPs) of the corresponding age and sex.Results: In patients with  with comorbid BA and obesity I degree there are more noticed syndromes of cytolysis and cholestasis, mesenchymal inflammation, more significant changes in the liver, as evidenced by the low AST/ALT ratio in this group. Patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis on the background of obesity of the I degree with the addition of bronchial asthma of moderate severity and the persistent flow at the exacerbation phase, the content in the blood of markers of the activity of cytolysis of hepatocytes increases (increased activity of aminotransferases serum, p <0,05), cholestasis (increased contentof direct bilirubin in the blood, p <0,05, cholesterol activity, p<0,05, gamma-glutamyltransferase activity, p <0,05 and alkaline phosphatase, p <0,05) and mesenchymal inflammation (increase in the thyme test, p <0,05), which testifies to the aggravating factor and the impact of BA on the course of .Conclusion: The presence of visceral obesity and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in patients with bronchial asthma leads to the accumulation of its clinical course, the deepening of changes in the function of external respiration by obstructive type (a possible decrease in FEV1 and PEF, p<0.05). The presence of obesity and  contributed to the development of restrictive type of respiratory insufficiency in the form of a possible decrease in Vital capacity (VC, p<0,05) in patients without BA, and in patients with  and obesity with BA, which significantly aggravated its course.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18486741>Active symptom control with or without chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MS01): a multicentre randomised trial.</a></h2><p>Malignant pleural mesothelioma is almost always fatal, and few treatment options are available. Although active symptom control (ASC) has been recommended for the management of this disease, no consensus exists for the role of chemotherapy. We investigated whether the addition of chemotherapy to ASC improved survival and quality of life.409 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, from 76 centres in the UK and two in Australia, were randomly assigned to ASC alone (treatment could include steroids, analgesic drugs, bronchodilators, palliative radiotherapy [n=136]); to ASC plus MVP (four cycles of mitomycin 6 mg/, vinblastine 6 mg/, and cisplatin 50 mg/ every 3 weeks [n=137]); or to ASC plus vinorelbine (one injection of vinorelbine 30 mg/ every week for 12 weeks [n=136]). Randomisation was done by minimisation, with stratification for WHO performance status, histology, and centre. Follow-up was every 3 weeks to 21 weeks after randomisation, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Because of slow accrual, the two chemotherapy groups were combined and compared with ASC alone for the primary outcome of overall survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN54469112.At the time of analysis, 393 (96%) patients had died (ASC 132 [97%], ASC plus MVP 132 [96%], ASC plus vinorelbine 129 [95%]). Compared with ASC alone, we noted a small, non-significant survival benefit for ASC plus chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.89 [95% CI 0.72-1.10]; p=0.29). Median survival was 7.6 months in the ASC alone group and 8.5 months in the ASC plus chemotherapy group. Exploratory analyses suggested a survival advantage for ASC plus vinorelbine compared with ASC alone (HR 0.80 [0.63-1.02]; p=0.08), with a median survival of 9.5 months. There was no evidence of a survival benefit with ASC plus MVP (HR 0.99 [0.78-1.27]; p=0.95). We observed no between-group differences in four predefined quality-of-life subscales (physical functioning, pain, dyspnoea, and global health status) at any of the assessments in the first 6 months.The addition of chemotherapy to ASC offers no significant benefits in terms of overall survival or quality of life.

Twenty-one unprimed bone marrow harvests and 174 peripheral blood stem cell mobilizations were performed on 187 patients. Disease indications were multiple sclerosis (76 patients), rheumatoid arthritis (37 patients), scleroderma (26 patients), systemic lupus erythematosus (19 patients), juvenile chronic arthritis (13 patients), idiopathic autoimmune thrombocytopenia (8 patients), Behcet's disease (3 patients), undifferentiated vasculitis (3 patients), polychondritis (1 patient) and polymyositis (1 patient). Bone marrow harvests were used in the Peoples Republic of China and preferred worldwide for children. PBSC mobilization was the preferred technique for adult stem cell collection in America, Australia, and Europe. Methods of PBSC mobilization included G-CSF (5, 10, or 16 microg/kg/day) or cyclophosphamide (2 or 4 g/) with either G-CSF (5 or 10 microg/kg/day) or GM-CSF (5 microg/kg/day). Bone marrow harvests were without complications and did not affect disease activity. A combination of cyclophosphamide and G-CSF was more likely to ameliorate disease activity than G-CSF alone (P < 0.001). g-csf alone was more likely to cause disease exacerbation than the combination of cyclophosphamide and g-csf (P = 0.003). Three patients died as a result of cyclophosphamide-based stem cell collection (2.6% of patients mobilized with cyclophosphamide). When corrected for patient weight and apheresis volume, progenitor cell yields tended to vary by underlying disease, prior medication history and mobilization regimen. Trends in the approaches to, and results of, progenitor cell mobilization are suggested by this survey. While cytokine-based mobilization appears less toxic, it is more likely to result in disease reactivation.

Extracellular reduced folate concentrations of 1 microM have been reported to yield maximal enzyme inhibition in several cell lines treated with 5-FU in vitro. Clinical studies indicate that low doses of leucovorin have equivalent efficacy to higher doses in successfully modulating 5-FU in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Based on pharmacokinetics at higher doses, steady-state total plasma reduced folate concentrations of 1 microM would be expected from the administration of leucovorin 50 mg/ by 24 h infusion. This dose was admixed with 5-FU 2300 mg/ and administered by 24 h-infusion weekly to 38 patients with advanced colorectal cancer, of whom 32 are evaluable for response. Disease sites included liver (33 patients), lung (12 patients), and bone (4 patients). Toxicity was mild to moderate, except for grade 3 diarrhea in 5 patients, and chest pain in 2 patients. Among the 32 evaluable patients, there were 14 partial remissions for a total response rate of 44% (95% confidence interval 27-61%). The median duration of response was seven (range 1 to 20+) months, and median duration of survival 16 months. These results support the use of low doses of leucovorin to modulate weekly infusional 5-FU in colorectal cancer, and provide a basis for the integration of this regimen with other modulators of 5-FU.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25347994>M1 polarization bias and subsequent nonalcoholic steatohepatitis progression is attenuated by nitric oxide donor DETA NONOate via inhibition of CYP2E1-induced oxidative stress in obese mice.</a></h2><p>Activation of M1 macrophages in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () is produced by several external or endogenous factors: inflammatory stimuli, oxidative stress, and cytokines are known. However, any direct role of oxidative stress in causing M1 polarization in  has been unclear. We hypothesized that CYP2E1-mediated oxidative stress causes M1 polarization in experimental , and that nitric oxide (NO) donor administration inhibits CYP2E1-mediated inflammation with concomitant attenuation of M1 polarization. Because CYP2E1 takes center stage in these studies, we used a toxin model of  that uses a ligand and a substrate of CYP2E1 for inducing . Subsequently, we used a methionine and choline-deficient diet-induced rodent  model where the role of CYP2E1 in disease progression has been shown. Our results show that CYP2E1 causes M1 polarization bias, which includes a significant increase in interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-12 in both models of , whereas CYP2E1-null mice or diallyl sulfide administration prevented it. Administration of gadolinium chloride (GdCl3), a macrophage toxin, attenuated both the initial M1 response and the subsequent  response, showing that the observed increase in cytokine levels is primarily from macrophages. Based on the evidence of an adaptive NO increase, the NO donor administration in vivo that mechanistically inhibited CYP2E1 catalyzed the oxidative stress during the entire study in -abrogated M1 polarization and  progression. The results obtained show the association of CYP2E1 in M1 polarization, and that inhibition of CYP2E1 catalyzed oxidative stress by an NO donor (DETA NONOate [(Z)-1-[N-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate]) can be a promising therapeutic strategy in .Copyright © 2014 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11458521>Nonmyeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation. Replacing high-dose cytotoxic therapy by the graft-versus-tumor effect.</a></h2><p>Conventional allografting produces considerable regimen-related toxicities that generally limit this treatment to patients younger than 55 years and in otherwise good medical condition. T cell-mediated graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effects are known to play an important role in the elimination of malignant disease after allotransplants. A minimally myelosuppressive regimen that relies on immunosuppression for allogeneic engraftment was developed to reduce toxicities while optimizing GVT effects. Pre-transplant total-body irradiation (200 cGy) followed by post-transplant immunosuppression with cyclosporine (CSP) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) permitted human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor hematopoietic cell engraftment in 82% of patients (n = 55) without prior high-dose therapy. The addition of fludarabine (90 mg/) facilitated engraftment in all 28 subsequent patients. Overall, fatal progression of underlying disease occurred in 20% of patients after transplant. Non-relapse mortality occurred in 11% of patients. Toxicities were low. Grade 2-4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) associated with primary engraftment developed in 47% of patients, and was readily controlled in all but two patients. Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) were not very effective at converting a low degree of mixed donor/host chimerism to full donor chimerism; however, the addition of fludarabine reduced the need for DLI. With a median follow-up of 244 days, 68% of patients were alive, with 42% of patients in complete remission, including molecular remissions. Remissions occurred gradually over periods of weeks to a year.

Consumption of β-cryptoxanthin possibly prevents nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), which is suggested to be caused by insulin resistance and oxidative stress from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. To evaluate the effect of β-cryptoxanthin on diet-induced , we fed a high-cholesterol and high-fat diet (CL diet) with or without 0.003% β-cryptoxanthin to C56BL/6J mice for 12 weeks. After feeding, β-cryptoxanthin attenuated fat accumulation, increases in Kupffer and activated stellate cells, and fibrosis in CL diet-induced  in the mice. Comprehensive gene expression analysis showed that although β-cryptoxanthin histochemically reduced steatosis, it was more effective in inhibiting inflammatory gene expression change in . β-Cryptoxanthin reduced the alteration of expression of genes associated with cell death, inflammatory responses, infiltration and activation of macrophages and other leukocytes, quantity of T cells, and free radical scavenging. However, it showed little effect on the expression of genes related to cholesterol and other lipid metabolism. The expression of markers of M1 and  macrophages, T helper cells, and cytotoxic T cells was significantly induced in  and reduced by β-cryptoxanthin. β-Cryptoxanthin suppressed the expression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inducible and/or TNFα-inducible genes in . Increased levels of the oxidative stress marker thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were reduced by β-cryptoxanthin in . Thus, β-cryptoxanthin suppresses inflammation and the resulting fibrosis probably by primarily suppressing the increase and activation of macrophages and other immune cells.

Hepatic fibrosis can also develop from metabolic liver disease, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (). We investigated the role of MIF in high-fat or methionine- and choline-deficient diet mouse models of . Mif(-/-) mice showed elevated liver triglyceride levels (WT, 53±14 mg/g liver; Mif(-/-), 103±7 mg/g liver; P<0.05) and a 2-3-fold increased expression of lipogenic genes. Increased fatty degeneration in the livers of Mif(-/-) mice was associated with increased hepatic inflammatory cells (1.6-fold increase in F4/80(+) macrophages) and proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., 2.3-fold increase in Tnf-α and 2-fold increase in Il-6 expression). However, inflammatory cells and cytokines were decreased by 50-90% in white adipose tissue (WAT) of Mif(-/-) mice. Subset analysis showed that macrophage phenotypes in livers of Mif(-/-) mice were skewed toward  (e.g., 1.7-fold and 2.5-fold increase in Arg1 and Il-13, respectively, and 2.5-fold decrease in iNos), whereas macrophages were generally reduced in WAT of these mice (70% reduction in mRNA expression of F4/80(+) macrophages). The protective MIF effect was scrutinized in isolated hepatocytes. MIF reversed inflammation-induced triglyceride accumulation in Hepa1-6 cells and primary hepatocytes and also attenuated oleic acid-elicited triglyceride increase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Protection from fatty hepatocyte degeneration was paralleled by a 2- to 3-fold reduction by MIF of hepatocyte proinflammatory cytokine production. Blockade of MIF receptor cluster of differentiation 74 (CD74) but not of CXCR2 or CXCR4 fully reverted the protective effect of MIF, comparable to AMPK inhibition. In summary, we demonstrate that MIF mediates hepatoprotection through the CD74/AMPK pathway in hepatocytes in metabolic models of liver injury.© FASEB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26662852>NKp46(+) natural killer cells attenuate metabolism-induced hepatic fibrosis by regulating macrophage activation in mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () affects 3%-5% of the U.S. population, having severe clinical complications to the development of fibrosis and end-stage liver diseases, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. A critical cause of  is chronic systemic inflammation promoted by innate immune cells, such as liver macrophages (Mϕ) and natural killer (NK) cells. However, little is known about how the crosstalk between Mϕ and NK cells contributes to regulate  progression to fibrosis. In this report, we demonstrate that NKp46(+) cells play an important role in preventing  progression to fibrosis by regulating M1/ polarization of liver Mϕ. Using a murine model of , we demonstrate that DX5(+)NKp46(+) NK cells are increased during disease and play a role in polarizing Mϕ toward M1-like phenotypes. This NK's immunoregulatory function depends on the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), but not by granzyme-mediated cytolytic activity. Notably, depletion of NKp46(+) cells promotes the development of fibrosis with increased expression of profibrogenic genes as well as skewed  Mϕ phenotypes in hepatic tissues.NK cell-derived IFN-γ may be essential for maintaining a balanced inflammatory environment that promotes tissue integrity and limiting  progression to fibrosis.© 2015 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29414684>Digoxin Suppresses Pyruvate Kinase -Promoted HIF-1α Transactivation in Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Sterile inflammation after tissue damage is a ubiquitous response, yet it has the highest amplitude in the liver.

At present, diagnosis of the more severe form of NAFLD, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), requires a liver biopsy. Conflicting data exist on the degree of sampling variability seen with percutaneous liver biopsy. Our aim was to assess for significant regional differences in histopathology between the right and left lobes of the liver in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery.Morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery at Wilford Hall Medical Center were eligible for study enrollment. Patients with chronic liver disease other than NAFLD were excluded. All patients underwent intraoperative liver biopsy, one from the right lobe and one from the left lobe, with a 14-gauge Tru-cut biopsy needle. Histopathologic features of NAFLD were compared by a hepatopathologist who examined biopsy specimens from the 2 hepatic lobes and was blinded to patient identification and site of origin of biopsy. Agreement between the 2 biopsy specimens was assessed by using the kappa coefficient.Forty-three patients (predominantly female) with body mass index median of 46.2 kg/ were enrolled. Agreement for steatosis was 93% (kappa = 0.91), inflammation 74% (kappa = 0.58), ballooning necrosis 84% (kappa = 0.73), fibrosis 98% (kappa = 0.96), and for the NAFLD activity score > or =5 was 93% (kappa = 0.83).Minimal variability was found for steatosis, NAFLD activity score > or =5, and fibrosis in samples of liver obtained from the right and left lobes of the liver in a group of morbidly obese, predominately female patients undergoing bariatric surgery.

However, little is known about the functional changes occurring in liver macrophages during  progression. In this study, we investigated phenotypic and functional modifications of hepatic macrophages in experimental  induced by feeding C57BL/6 mice with a methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet up to 8weeks. In mice with steatohepatitis liver F4/80-positive macrophages increased in parallel with the disease progression and formed small clusters of enlarged and vacuolated cells. At immunofluorescence these cells contained lipid vesicles positive for the apoptotic cell marker Annexin V suggesting the phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies derived from dead fat-laden hepatocytes. Flow cytometry revealed that these enlarged macrophages expressed inflammatory monocyte (CD11b, Ly6C, TNF-α) markers. However, as compared to regular size macrophages the enlarged sub-set was characterized by an enhanced production of arginase-1 and of the anti-inflammatory mediators IL-10 and annexin A1. Similar vacuolated macrophages producing annexin A1 were also evident in liver biopsies of  patients. In mice with , the accumulation of enlarged F4/80(+) cells paralleled with a decline in the expression of the macrophage M1 activation markers iNOS, IL-12 and CXCL10, while the levels of  polarization markers arginase-1 and MGL-1 were unchanged. Interestingly, the lowering of IL-12 expression mainly involved the macrophage sub-set with regular size. We conclude that during the progression of  fat accumulation within liver macrophages promotes the production of anti-inflammatory mediators that influence hepatic inflammatory responses.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The primary infection is characterized by virus replication in lung epithelial cells and the establishment of a latent infection in B lymphocytes. The virus is also observed to persist in lung epithelial cells, dendritic cells and macrophages. Splenomegaly is observed two weeks after infection, in which there is a CD4+ T-cell-mediated expansion of B and T cells in the spleen. At three weeks post-infection an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome is observed involving a major expansion of Vbeta4+CD8+ T cells. Later in the course of persistent infection, ca. 10% of mice develop lymphoproliferative disease characterized as lymphomas of B-cell origin. The genome from MHV-68 strain g2.4 has been sequenced and contains ca. 73 genes, the majority of which are collinear and homologous to other gamma-herpesviruses. The genome includes cellular homologues for a complement-regulatory protein, Bcl-2, cyclin D and interleukin-8 receptor and a set of novel genes M1 to M4. The function of these genes in the context of latent infections, evasion of immune responses and virus-mediated pathologies is discussed. Both innate and adaptive immune responses play an active role in limiting virus infection. The absence of type I interferon (IFN) results in a lethal MHV-68 infection, emphasizing the central role of these cytokines at the initial stages of infection. In contrast, type II IFN is not essential for the recovery from infection in the lung, but a failure of type II IFN receptor signalling results in the atrophy of lymphoid tissue associated with virus persistence. Splenic atrophy appears to be the result of immunopathology, since in the absence of CD8+ T cells no pathology occurs. CD8+ T cells play a major role in recovery from the primary infection, and also in regulating latently infected cells expressing the  gene product. CD4+ T cells have a key role in surveillance against virus recurrences in the lung, in part mediated through 'help' in the genesis of neutralizing antibodies. In the absence of CD4+ T cells, virus-specific CD8+ T cells are able to control the primary infection in the respiratory tract, yet surprisingly the memory CD8+ T cells generated are unable to inhibit virus recurrences in the lung. This could be explained in part by the observations that this virus can downregulate major histocompatibility complex class I expression and also restrict inflammatory cell responses by producing a chemokine-binding protein (M3 gene product). MHV-68 provides an excellent model to explore methods for controlling gamma-herpesvirus infection through vaccination and chemotherapy. Vaccination with gp150 (a homologue of gp350 of Epstein-Barr virus) results in a reduction in splenomegaly and virus latency but does not block replication in the lung, nor the establishment of a latent infection. Even when lung virus infection is greatly reduced following the action of CD8+ T cells, induced via a prime-boost vaccination strategy, a latent infection is established. Potent antiviral compounds such as the nucleoside analogue 2'deoxy-5-ethyl-beta-4'-thiouridine, which disrupts virus replication in vivo, cannot inhibit the establishment of a latent infection. Clearly, devising strategies to interrupt the establishment of latent virus infections may well prove impossible with existing methods.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30746959>Comparative study of overweight and obese patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disorder in the western world.

Diagnostic performance and association to fibrosis staging in chronic hepatitis C.</a></h2><p>Although long regarded as the gold standard for liver fibrosis staging in chronic hepatitis C (CHC), liver biopsy (LB) implies both the risk of an invasive procedure and significant variability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance for transient elastography (TE) and aspartate aminotransferase to platelet index (APRI) used alone and in combination compared to liver biopsy and to analyze false positive/negative results. Patients with CHC, and no previous clinical diagnosis of cirrhosis were enrolled to undergo liver biopsy, TE and APRI. A total of 182 adult patients with a median age of 55 years and median body mass index of 26.71 kg/ were analyzed. On LB, 56% of patients had significant levels of fibrosis (METAVIR F≥2) and 28% had advanced fibrosis (F3/F4). The strongest performance for both tests was observed for exclusion of advanced fibrosis with good negative predictive values (89 and 86%, respectively). Low necroinflammatory activity on LB was associated with false negative TE. False positives were associated with  and smaller LB fragments. Correlation between APRI and Fibroscan for F≥2 was 100% and 84% for F≥3 and remained high in both false negative and false positive instances, correctly identifying F<2 in 71% of cases and F<3 in 78% (and potentially foregoing up to 84% of LB). We concluded that low individual performance indicators could be attributable to limitations of LB. Poorer differentiation of lower levels of fibrosis is a known issue for LB and remains so for noninvasive tests. Good predictability is possible, however, for advanced fibrosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19005415>A prospective observational study of changes in renal function and cardiovascular risk following living kidney donation.</a></h2><p>The effect of unilateral nephrectomy on the cardiovascular risk profile of living kidney donors has not been prospectively studied. We performed an observational cohort study of 58 living donors to 6 months postdonation for changes in 24-hr ambulatory blood pressure profiles, renal function, urine protein excretion, body mass index, glucose tolerance, and fasting lipid profiles. The 24-hr systolic blood pressure average and night-day ratio were unchanged from pre- to postdonation (118.9+/-11 vs. 118.1+/-14 mm Hg, P=0.77; 0.87+/-0.07 vs. 0.87+/-0.09, P=0.68, respectively). Estimated glomerular filtration rate declined from 91.9+/-16 to 61.6+/-12 mL/min/1.73  (P<0.0001). Protein excretion, body mass index, glucose, and lipids were unchanged. No significant differences were noted between dippers and nondippers either pre- or postdonation. In summary, living kidney donation in the short term is safe. We suggest further observation of individuals with lower glomerular filtration rate for possible increased cardiovascular risk factors in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28695813>Value of Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Imaging in the Diagnosis of Early Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Objective To evaluate the value of acoustic radiation force impulse(ARFI)imaging in the diagnosis of early non-alcoholic steatohepatitis().Methods Totally 32 SD rats were randomly divided into high-fat diet group(n=24)and normal-diet group(n=8)by using the random number table. At the end of the 4,8,12,and 16 week,six rats from the high-diet group and two rats from the normal-diet group were selected blindly for weighting,blood biochemical test,conventional ultrasound,and ARFI imaing. HE staining was used for pathological observation. Results None of the 32 rats developed liver fibrosis. Based on the pathological results,these rats were divided into M1 [mild-to-moderate simple fatty liver(SS)],(severe SS),M3(severe SS with early ),and C groups(normal control). Early  was seen only in the severe hepatic steatosis groups,and its distribution had a significant difference(P=0.006). The diagnostic accuracy of conventional ultrasound based on histological results was 34.4%(11/32). The ARFI value of M3 group was significantly lower than that of  group [(1.16±0.04)m/s vs.(1.22±0.05)m/s;t=2.301,P=0.04),and the low-density lipoprotein of M3 group was significantly higher than  group [(1.53±0.07)mmol/L vs.(1.21±0.22)mmol/L;t=3.075,P=0.01),while other clinical indicators had no statistical difference between these two groups. Conclusions The development of early  is associated with the severity of hepatic steatosis.

In a lipotoxic model of : mice fed a high-cholesterol and high-fat diet, astaxanthin alleviated excessive hepatic lipid accumulation and peroxidation, increased the proportion of M1-type macrophages/Kupffer cells, and activated stellate cells to improve hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Moreover, astaxanthin caused an -dominant shift in macrophages/Kupffer cells and a subsequent reduction in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell recruitment in the liver, which contributed to improved insulin resistance and hepatic inflammation. Importantly, astaxanthin reversed insulin resistance, as well as hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, in pre-existing . Overall, astaxanthin was more effective at both preventing and treating  compared with vitamin E in mice.

Chemerin mRNA was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, chemerin, and CMKLR1 immunohistochemical expression with specific antibodies, while serum chemerin concentration was assessed with commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Serum chemerin concentration reached 874.1 ±234.6 ng/ml. There was no difference in serum chemerin levels between patients with BMI < 40 kg/ and ≥ 40 kg/. Serum chemerin concentration tended to be higher in patients with hepatocyte ballooning, greater extent of steatosis, and definite nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ().

Next, we investigated the preventative and therapeutic effects of β-cryptoxanthin using a lipotoxic model of : mice fed a high-cholesterol and high-fat (CL) diet. After 12 weeks of CL diet feeding, β-cryptoxanthin administration attenuated insulin resistance and excessive hepatic lipid accumulation and peroxidation, with increases in M1-type macrophages/Kupffer cells and activated stellate cells, and fibrosis in CL diet-induced . Comprehensive gene expression analysis showed that β-cryptoxanthin down-regulated macrophage activation signal-related genes significantly without affecting most lipid metabolism-related genes in the liver.

We aimed to study the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NNMT gene, namely rs694539 and the development of different stages of NAFLD diagnosed by controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) of FibroScan Echosens®.Transient elastography (FibroScan®) with controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) measurement was performed in 81 NAFLD patients (35 of them with liver biopsy) and 80 non-NAFLD controls. The accuracy of CAP and FibroScan for the detection and quantification of hepatic steatosis/fibrosis, respectively, was assessed based on liver biopsy aspect. Genetic variants of NNMT gene rs694539 were analyzed using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).According to BMI (kg/), among the patients, 17 (21%) were overweight, 56 (69.1%) obese, and 8 (9.9%) morbidly obese. CAP and FibroScan diagnosed steatosis/fibrosis correlated significantly with liver biopsy. There was a significant association between polymorphisms of rs694539-NNMT gene and NAFLD presence and stages.

Sirolimus was started 19-78 (median 37) days after HSCT when 10 patients had grade III and 11 had grade IV GVHD. The first four patients received a loading dose (15 mg/) of oral sirolimus on day 1 followed by 5 mg//day for 13 days. The next 17 patients received either 5 (n=7) or 4 (n=10) mg//day for 14 days without a loading dose. Eleven patients completed the 14-day sirolimus course. Five patients were treated for 9-13 days, two for 6 days, and three for 1-3 days.Sirolimus was discontinued early in 10 patients because of lack of improvement in GVHD (n=5), myelosuppression (n=2), seizure (n=2), and attending physician preference (n=1). The most common and significant adverse events were thrombocytopenia (n=7) and neutropenia (n=4). Other side effects included increased blood triglycerides (n=8) and cholesterol (n=3). Five patients had evidence of a hemolytic uremic syndrome concurrently with or after sirolimus treatment. Eighteen of the 21 patients received 6 or more doses of sirolimus and 12 responded, 5 with complete and 7 with partial responses.

However, the morbid obesity impedes qualification for organ transplantation.We present a case report of a 56-year-old woman who underwent bariatric procedure followed by liver transplantation (LTx). Her initial weight was 130.2 kg (BMI 50.9 kg/). The patient had a history of arterial hypertension, diabetes, gonarthrosis, and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and no history of alcohol abuse. She underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) procedure. The routine intraoperative liver biopsy revealed fibrosis (III°), steatosis (II°), and intra-acinar inﬂammation. The operation led to a substantial loss of weight. Two years after the surgery the patient was referred to the Transplantation Clinic of Department of General Surgery and Transplantology with suspicion of liver failure due to advanced cirrhosis, which could be a result of previously diagnosed  and, probably, excessive alcohol use after bariatric surgery. The patient was qualified for elective LTx, which was performed 3 years after the RYGB. Immediately before LTx, the patient's weight was 65 kg (BMI 25.4 kg/m²). The postoperative period was complicated by bleeding into the peritoneal cavity, which required reoperation. She also had renal failure, requiring renal replacement therapy. One year after LTx, she showed stable liver function with normal transaminases activity and bilirubin concentration, remission of diabetes, and good renal function.Steatohepatitis in morbidly obese patients may lead to cirrhosis.

Cell proliferation and fibrogenic markers were analyzed in hHSC exposed to ACh, atropine, mecamylamine, methoctramine, and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide. mAChR expression was analyzed in human  scored for fibrosis.We observed that hHSC synthesize ACh and acetylcholinesterase and express choline acetyltransferase and M1-M5 mAChR. We also show that  was increased during  progression, while both  and M3 were found upregulated in activated hHSC. Furthermore, endogenous ACh is required for hHSC basal growth. Exogenous ACh resulted in hHSC hyperproliferation via mAChR and phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) signaling pathways, as well as increased fibrogenic markers.We show that ACh regulates hHSC activation via  and M3 mAChR involving the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and MEK pathways in vitro.

Although standard interferon (INF) has better efficacy in pediatric patients than in adults, results in children with genotype 1 are poor; response rates to combination treatment with standard INF and ribavirin are better but the treatment requires thrice-weekly injections. The improved antiviral efficacy of weekly pegylated interferons relative to standard interferons in adults with chronic HCV infection suggests that pegylated interferons may also improve antiviral efficacy in children. We therefore investigated the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of peginterferon alpha2a (pegINF-alpha2a) (40 kd) in 14 children ages 2 to 8 years with chronic hepatitis C (13 genotype 1, 1 non-1 genotype). Drug dose was calculated from each patient's body surface area (BSA) according to the formula BSA ()/(1.73 ) x 180 microg, and patients were administered once-weekly subcutaneous injections for 48 weeks. Viral load and pharmacokinetic parameters were determined from blood drawn throughout the study and during follow-up. At week 24, the mean trough concentration was about 20% below values obtained from adults treated with pegINF-alpha2a, and the area under the curve from 0 to 168 hours was about 20% above adult values, suggesting that drug doses calculated from BSA achieved therapeutically adequate concentrations. Six of 14 patients (43%), all infected with genotype 1, achieved a sustained virological response. Adverse events were those commonly associated with INF-based treatment, and none was deemed serious. In conclusion, our findings provide a basis for larger studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of pegINF-alpha2a as monotherapy as well as in combination with ribavirin in pediatric patients with chronic hepatitis C.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12915582>Murid herpesvirus 4 strain 68  protein is a B-cell-associated antigen important for latency but not lymphocytosis.</a></h2><p>This work describes analyses of the function of the murid herpesvirus 4 strain 68 (MHV-68)  gene.

MerTK is mainly expressed in anti-inflammatory  macrophages where it mediates transcriptional changes including suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and enhancement of inflammatory repressors. MerTK is regulated by metabolic pathways through nuclear sensors including LXRs, PPARs, and RXRs, in response to apoptotic bodies or to other sources of cholesterol. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most serious public health problems worldwide. It is a clinicopathological syndrome closely related to obesity, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. It includes a spectrum of conditions ranging from simple steatosis, characterized by hepatic fat accumulation with or without inflammation, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), defined by hepatic fat deposition with hepatocellular damage, inflammation, and accumulating fibrosis. Several studies support an association between NAFLD and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis, a major cause of death worldwide. This pathological condition consists in a chronic and progressive inflammatory process in the intimal layer of large- and medium-sized arteries. The complications of advanced atherosclerosis include chronic or acute ischemic damage in the tissue perfused by the affected artery, leading to cellular death. By identifying specific targets influencing lipid metabolism and cardiovascular-related diseases, the present review highlights the role of MerTK in NAFLD-associated atherosclerotic lesions as a potential innovative therapeutic target. Therapeutic advantages might derive from the use of compounds selective for nuclear receptors targeting PPARs rather than LXRs regulating macrophage lipid metabolism and macrophage mediated inflammation, by favoring the expression of MerTK, which mediates an immunoregulatory action with a reduction in inflammation and in atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23627434>Fetuin-A mRNA expression is elevated in  compared with NAFL patients.</a></h2><p>Fetuin-A is a pro-inflammatory protein expressed by hepatocytes. Its course in morbidly obese patients with NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) following weight loss by BAS (bariatric surgery) has not been fully elucidated yet. In the present study, we prospectively examined the effects of weight loss on various metabolic factors at 4 weeks and 6 months after surgery. Blood and liver tissues were retrieved from 108 morbidly obese NAFLD patients before/during BAS, and 50 of these individuals met the criteria for  (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis). Fetuin-A expression was measured by qPCR (quantitative real-time PCR), Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Hepatocyte apoptosis was quantified via M30 (caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18 fragments). Plasma concentrations of adiponectin and fetuin-A were determined by ELISA. Serum-derived parameters were additionally taken at 4 weeks and 6 months post-operatively. In addition, primary human hepatocytes were treated with NEFA (non-esterified fatty acid) to investigate changes in fetuin-A. BMI (body mass index) decreased significantly from 53.0±1.1 to 36.4±1.9 kg/ in the NAFL group and from 53.3±1.1 to 37.6±1.2 kg/ in the  group (P<0.0001) at 6 months post-surgery. This was associated with diminishing M30 and M65 (total cytokeratin-18) levels over 6 months after surgery. Adiponectin levels increased continuously in  patients, whereas NAFL patients plateaued at 4 weeks post-operatively. Hepatic fetuin-A mRNA and protein expression was elevated before surgery-induced weight loss. However, plasma concentrations of fetuin-A increased signficantly in  patients 4 weeks post-operatively. Treatment of hepatocytes with NEFA led to up-regulation of fetuin-A expression. BAS probably has a beneficial effect on NAFLD, as indicated by reduced hepatocyte apoptosis and improved adipokine profiles. In addition, fetuin-A expression is more prominent in .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16545157>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass improves the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () of morbid obesity.</a></h2><p>Hepatic steatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () have been increasingly implicated in the genesis of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis.

Nowadays it is considered as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. The frequency of Non Alcoholic Sreatohepatic () is 30 to 35% in general population, but it reaches to 70% in patients whose Body Mass Index (BMI) is above 30 kg/ as it occurs with diabetic patients. In Mexico there are only isolated reports about it's frequency, nearly 7.1% in general population and 18.5% in diabetic patients.To know the frequency of the Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in patients who receive medical attention at the city of Veracruz.We studied 337 patients, who were divided into 4 groups: Normal Weight, Overweight, Obese and Diabetes type 2 patients. The individuals who reported previous hepatitis and alcohol consumption were excluded. All patients made a test in order to determinate: age, gender, presence of hepatic stigmata and complaints. Laboratory tests were done to all patients including: Blood glucose, seric lipids, transaminases, proteins and alkaline phosphatase. In those cases with impairment in transaminases results, it was done upper abdominal ultrasound (USG) and hepatic biopsy, in patients who accepted.We identified 53 cases (15.72%) with characteristics of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The frequency in patient with normal weight and overweight was 7.14% to 7.76%, while in obese subjects it was 14.15% and 28% in diabetic patients; 73.58% of all patients were female and the other 28.41% were males. The average age of the group was 48.11 years, it was similar the specific age of the normal weight and obese patients, in overweight patients was 61.5 years and the average age in diabetics was 56.42 years. There were significant differences in the results of blood glucose level, glycosilated hemoglobin, cholesterol, seric lipid values and aminotransferases in obese and diabetic patients compared with normal subjects and overweight patients in our study, the USG did not show sensibility and specificity to detect Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).The results of this study show a lower frequency compared with the rest of the world, however it was higher in diabetic population than the frequency published by Bernal in Hidalgo, Mexico. The aminotransferases level resulted elevated in all patients with metabolic syndrome and NAFLD so we consider that elevated aminotransferases levels is the best predictor to suspect the presence of NAFLD. That is why it's very important to consider the possibility to avoid the progression to cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20167877>Serum proteomic analysis of diet-induced steatohepatitis and metabolic syndrome in the Ossabaw miniature swine.</a></h2><p>We recently developed a nutritional model of steatohepatitis and metabolic syndrome in Ossabaw pigs.

Moreover, macrophage mTORC1 disruption exacerbated the inflammatory response in 2 diet-induced  mouse models. Mechanistically, in response to apoptotic hepatocytes (AHs), macrophage polarization toward a  anti-inflammatory phenotype was inhibited in Raptor-deficient macrophages. During the digestion of AHs, macrophage mTORC1 was activated and coupled with dynamin-related protein 1 to facilitate the latter's phosphorylation, leading to mitochondrial fission-mediated calcium release.

In rodents and human patients, RYGB induces an increase in the gene and protein expression levels of the  isoenzyme of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) in the jejunum. Since PKM2 can be secreted in the circulation, our hypothesis was that the circulating levels of PKM2 increase after RYGB. Our data, however, revealed an unexpected finding and a potential new role of PKM2 for the natural history of metabolic syndrome and NAFLD. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, RYGB-treated patients had decreased PKM2 blood levels compared with a well-matched group of patients with severe obesity before RYGB. Interestingly, PKM2 serum concentration correlated with body mass index before but not after the surgery. This prompted us to evaluate other potential mechanisms and sites of PKM2 regulation by the metabolic syndrome and RYGB. We found that in patients with NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), the liver had increased PKM2 expression levels, and the enzyme appears to be specifically localized in Kupffer cells. The study of murine models of metabolic syndrome and  replicated this pattern of expression, further suggesting a metabolic link between hepatic PKM2 and NAFLD. Therefore, we conclude that PKM2 serum and hepatic levels increase in both metabolic syndrome and NAFLD and decrease after RYGB. Thus, PKM2 may represent a new target for monitoring and treatment of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22142284>Bias in macrophage activation pattern influences non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () in mice.</a></h2><p>In humans, there is large inter-individual variability in the evolution of NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) to  (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis).

Following 4 weeks on the MCD diet, steatosis and lobular inflammation were prevalent in C57BL/6 (Th1, M1 oriented) than in Balb/c (Th2,  oriented) mice. Consistently, hepatic TNFα (tumour necrosis factor α) mRNA expression and circulating TNFα levels were higher in MCD-fed C57BL/6 than in MCD-fed Balb/c mice. The Th1/Th2 bias did not account for the increased  severity, as in both strains MCD feeding did not significantly modify the liver mRNA expression of the Th1 markers IFNγ (interferon γ) and T-bet or that of the Th2 markers IL-4 (interleukin 4) and GATA-3. Conversely, MCD-fed C57BL/6 mice displayed higher liver mRNAs for the macrophage M1 activation markers iNOS (inducible NO synthase), IL-12p40 and CXCL10 (CXC chemokine ligand 10) than similarly treated Balb/c mice, without effects on the  polarization markers IL-10 and MGL-1 (macrophage galactose-type C-type lectin-1). Circulating IL-12 was also higher in MCD-fed C57BL/6 than in MCD-fed Balb/c mice. The analysis of macrophages isolated from the livers of MCD-fed animals confirmed an enhanced expression of M1 markers in C57BL/6 mice.

As the spinal cord is the highway that allows for the brain to control the rest of the body, spinal cord injuries greatly impact the quality of life of the patients. The SCI include the primary response consisting of the initial accident-induced damage and the secondary response that is characterized by damage due to inflammation and biological responses. Astrocytes are the first to act at the site of the injury, forming a glial scar and attracting immune cells. The immune system plays a role in cleaning out the debris caused by the injury, as well as preventing neurons to grow and heal. The secondary injury caused by the inflammatory response is the major target to combat SCI. This article critically reviews the key players in the inflammatory SCI response and potential therapies, specifically targeting astrocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages. These cells are both beneficial and detrimental following SCI, depending on the released molecules and the types of cells infiltrated to the site of injury. Indeed, depending on the subtype of macrophages, M1 or , beneficial or detrimental response could be incited. Therapeutic strategies to regulate and manipulate the immune cells via increasing or decreasing their recruitment to the site of injury could be developed together with upregulating and downregulating the release of certain chemicals from the infiltrated cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30608932>High prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and abnormal liver stiffness in a young and obese Mexican population.</a></h2><p>To identify nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () and liver stiffness in Mexican subjects with different body mass index (BMI).A cross-sectional study was conducted in 505 adults.

Increasing evidence connects non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to CKD. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether the presence and severity of NAFLD are associated with the presence and severity of CKD.English and non-English articles from international online databases from 1980 through January 31, 2014 were searched. Observational studies assessing NAFLD by histology, imaging, or biochemistry and defining CKD as either estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73  or proteinuria were included. Two reviewers extracted studies independently and in duplicate. Individual participant data (IPD) were solicited from all selected studies. Studies providing IPD were combined with studies providing only aggregate data with the two-stage method. Main outcomes were pooled using random-effects models. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were used to explore sources of heterogeneity and the effect of potential confounders.

In cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, the severity of NAFLD was positively associated with CKD stages. Limitations of analysis are the relatively small size of studies utilizing liver histology and the suboptimal sensitivity of ultrasound and biochemistry for NAFLD detection in population-based studies.The presence and severity of NAFLD are associated with an increased risk and severity of CKD.

This study was conducted to delineate the clinical profile of incidentally detected NAFLD patients.A retrospective analysis of clinical, biochemical and histological parameters was performed for 632 patients in whom fatty liver was diagnosed by ultrasonography during 2006-2010. Every patient's clinical presentation, history, liver function tests, blood sugar, lipid profile, ultrasonogram, histology and other relevant investigations were analyzed. Patients referred for transaminitis or overt chronic liver disease were excluded.Out of 632 consecutive NAFLD patients, 484 (76.6%) were males and 148 (23.4%) were females. Mean age of our patients was 42.44 +/- 10.18 years. Their mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.14 +/- 3.38 kg/. Obesity (BMI > 25), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance were present in 61.7%, 15.2%, 19.8%, 62.0%, 40.0%, and 54.4% patients, respectively. SGOT and SGPT were elevated in 38.29% and 55.1% patients, respectively. The common primary diseases for which these patients sought consultation were non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) (54.5%) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (29.4%). Of the 64 patients who underwent liver biopsy, one-fourth had definite  while one-third patients had fibrosis.In India, incidentally detected NAFLD (IDNAFLD) patients are predominantly middle aged males, most of whom are not lean.

NAFLD and  are associated with increased systemic lipid peroxidation levels and elevated hepatic CYP2E1 activity, but hepatic CYP3A4/5 activity is decreased.Liver biopsies from 20 patients with NAFLD who underwent bariatric surgery were obtained intraoperatively and at 15 +/- 7 months following surgery. Hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (a marker of lipid peroxidation), CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 protein expression, and steatosis, as a percent of total area, were measured by immunohistochemistry followed by digital image quantitation.Following weight loss, as reflected by reduced BMI (54 +/- 9 vs. 37 +/- 9 kg/; P < 0.001), features of the metabolic syndrome, grade and stage of liver disease, and liver histology were all significantly improved (P < 0.01). Hepatic MDA staining (35 +/- 18% vs. 23 +/- 14%; P = 0.02), CYP2E1 protein content (68 +/- 9% vs. 56 +/- 11%; P < 0.001), and steatosis (17 +/- 7% vs. 2 +/- 3%; P < 0.001) were significantly reduced following weight loss. CYP3A4/5 protein content was unchanged (57 +/- 13% vs. 55 +/- 13%; P = 0.433). The reduction in lipid peroxidation was independently associated with changes in CYP2E1 protein expression after bariatric surgery (r = 0.477; P = 0.033).Elevations in hepatic lipid peroxidation and CYP2E1 expression that are seen in NAFLD improve significantly with weight loss induced by bariatric surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8390421>Report of phase II trial of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with radical thoracic irradiation (60 Gy), infusional fluorouracil, bolus cisplatin and etoposide for clinical stage IIIB and bulky IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h2><p>To assess the response rate, median and long-term survival of patients (pts) with locally advanced, initially inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated on a phase II study of radical thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) and concurrent radiosensitizing chemotherapy.From 3/87 to 7/90, 41 previously untreated patients at Fox Chase Cancer Center with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, 24 with bulky clinical Stage IIIA, and 17 with IIIB disease, received concurrent thoracic radiotherapy (60 Gy/2.0 Gy/d in 6 weeks) and 2 cycles of infusional 5FU (640-800 mg//24 hrs x 5 d); cisplatin (20 mg/ qd x 5); and etoposide (50 mg/ d 1, 2, 5) administered days 1 and 28 of TRT.Forty of 41 were evaluable. Response rate was 90%, with radiographic CR in 20%. Thirteen pts (33%) underwent thoracotomy and complete resection with clinical downstaging in 10, including three pathologic CR's. Overall median survival was 14 months and 2-year survival was 38% with no difference between CS IIIA and IIIB pts (p = 0.2224). At median potential follow-up of 42 months, 8/40 pts.

A database was built considering clinical, biochemical and histology data. The exams were performed with a medium probe. An exam was considered valid when success rate was higher than 60% and interquartile range lower than 30%.1,023 studies were performed. Patients were referred by in-hospital (53%) and out-hospital physicians (47%). Etiologies were: HCV 409 (40%), NAFLD 213 (20.8%), HBV 110 (10.7%), cholestasis 93 (9.1%), other 198 (19.4%). Significant fibrosis (F > 2) was detected in 32.4% HCV, 32.1% HBV 31.5% , and 33.4% cholestasis. Exams were not technically achievable in 29 patients (2.8%), of whom 96.5% had body mass index (BMI) higher than 28 kg/. However 117 of 145 patients with BMI higher than 28 kg/ had a successful exam. In 332 patients simultaneously biopsies (less than 6 months) were obtained, with overall coincidence of 77%. In 21 HCV transplanted patients coincidence was 90.4%.Similar results to those in the literature were obtained, with excellent biopsy correlation in HCV transplanted patients.

We administered 6 x 10(5) IU/ of rIL-2 (0.03 mg/ Proleukin rIL-2) intraperitoneally (i.p.) over 30 min on each of 4 days. One and one-half liters of D5 0.25 NS was injected i.p. before each rIL-2 infusion. Multiple peritoneal fluid samples were obtained from each of four patients on day 1 and day 4 for detection of IL-2, endogenous cytokines, and soluble IL-2 receptor (IL-2R-alpha). IL-2 concentrations in the peritoneal fluid were determined by bioassay and interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 2, and sIL-2R-alpha by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Numbers of cells per microliter and lymphocyte subpopulation percentages after staining with a panel of monoclonal antibodies were determined on day 1, day 4, and subsequent off-treatment days. IL-2 disappearance in the p.c. was well described by a pharmacokinetic model having constant-rate infusion and biexponential disposition. About 90% of the IL-2 disappearance occurred during the beta-phase, during which IL-2 concentrations were sustained at approximately 10-30 ng/ml (day 1 and day 4) and the median t1/2 beta was 21.5 and 9.2 h on days 1 and 4, respectively. In four of four patients, p.c. production of IL-10 was observed on day 1 and day 4 (maximum 387 pg/ml). Maximum levels of IFN-gamma and sIL-2R-alpha were observed on day 4. (IFN-gamma 217 pg/ml; sIL2-R-alpha: 3486 U/ml). No increases in TNF-alpha or TGF-beta 2 were observed. Large increases in p.c. CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD16+, and CD56+ cells were observed.

Previous studies have been variable regarding the histological outcomes after rapid weight loss. The aim of this study was to characterize the histopathologic changes in  following laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass surgery (LRYGBP).We retrospectively analyzed paired needle liver biopsies taken during and following LRYGBP in 39 patients according to the recent NIH-based NAFLD criteria.The cohort included 33 females and 6 males (range 24-57 years). 23 patients (58.9%) had steatohepatitis, 12 with fatty liver (30.7%), and 4 were normal (10.2%). Follow-up needle liver biopsies were performed at a mean interval of 18 months (range 6-41 months). No significant differences in length or number of portal tracts between the paired biopsies were noted. The mean decrease in weight and BMI was 50.2 kg and 18.2 kg/, respectively. The initial prevalence of hepatic pathology: steatosis (89.7%), hepatocellular ballooning (58.9%), and centrilobular/perisinusoidal fibrosis (50%) improved significantly after LRYGBP: steatosis (2.9%), ballooning (0%), and centrilobular fibrosis (25%). Mitigation in the lobular inflammation score (2.23+/-0.63 vs 1.95+/-0.56, P=0.01) and stage of fibrosis (1.14+/-1.05 to 0.72+/-0.97, P=0.002) were also noted.

In cellular proliferation, Ca2+ mobilization, and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET-2) assays, diltiazem was a partial agonist at GHSR1a receptors, with 50 to 80% relative efficacy compared with the GHSR1a peptide agonist GHRP-6, and high nanomolar to low micromolar potency, depending upon the assay. Seven of the known primary metabolites of diltiazem were synthesized, and three of them (MA, M1, and ) were more efficacious and/or more potent than diltiazem at GHSR1a receptors, with a rank order of agonist activity of  > M1 > MA > diltiazem, whereas M4 and M6 metabolites displayed weak agonist activity, and the M8 and M9 metabolites were inactive. Binding affinities of diltiazem and these metabolites to GHSR1a receptors followed a similar rank order. In vivo tests showed that diltiazem and  each stimulated growth hormone release in male Sprague-Dawley neonatal rats, although to a lesser degree than GHRP-6. Thus, diltiazem and chemical analogs of diltiazem represent a new class of GHSR1a receptor agonists. The possible contributions of GHSR1a receptor activation to the clinical actions of diltiazem are discussed in the context of the known beneficial cardiovascular effects of ghrelin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28344991>Antibody-Directed Glucocorticoid Targeting to CD163 in -type Macrophages Attenuates Fructose-Induced Liver Inflammatory Changes.</a></h2><p>Increased consumption of high-caloric carbohydrates contributes substantially to endemic non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in humans, covering a histological spectrum from fatty liver to steatohepatitis. Hypercaloric intake and lipogenetic effects of fructose and endotoxin-driven activation of liver macrophages are suggested to be essential to disease progression. In the present study, we show that a low dose of an anti-CD163-IgG-dexamethasone conjugate targeting the hemoglobin scavenger receptor CD163 in Kupffer cells and other -type macrophages has a profound effect on liver inflammatory changes in rats on a high-fructose diet. The diet induced severe non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ()-like changes within a few weeks but the antibody-drug conjugate strongly reduced inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, fibrosis, and glycogen deposition. Non-conjugated dexamethasone or dexamethasone conjugated to a control IgG did not have this effect but instead exacerbated liver lipid accumulation. The low-dose anti-CD163-IgG-dexamethasone conjugate displayed no apparent systemic side effects. In conclusion, macrophage targeting by antibody-directed anti-inflammatory low-dose glucocorticoid therapy seems to be a promising approach for safe treatment of fructose-induced liver inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24249635>Resolvin D1 primes the resolution process initiated by calorie restriction in obesity-induced steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), characterized by hepatic steatosis combined with inflammation, are major sequelae of obesity. Currently, lifestyle modification (i.e., weight loss) is the first-line therapy for . However, weight loss resolves steatosis but not inflammation. In this study, we tested the ability of resolvin D1 (RvD1), an anti-inflammatory and proresolving molecule, to promote the resolution initiated by calorie restriction in obese mice with . Calorie restriction reduced adipose and liver weight (-56 and -13%, respectively; P<0.001), serum leptin and resistin levels, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance. In addition to these, mice receiving RvD1 during the dietary intervention showed increased adiponectin expression at both the mRNA and protein levels and reduced liver macrophage infiltration (-15%, P<0.01). Moreover, RvD1 skewed macrophages from an M1- to an -like anti-inflammatory phenotype, induced a specific hepatic miRNA signature (i.e., miR-219-5p and miR-199a-5p), and reduced inflammatory adipokine mRNA and protein expression and macrophage innate immune response. In precision-cut liver slices (PCLSs), which override the influence of circulating factors, RvD1 attenuated hypoxia-induced mRNA and protein expression of COX-2, IL-1β, IL-6, and CCR7. Of note, RvD1 anti-inflammatory actions were absent in macrophage-depleted PCLSs. In summary, RvD1 acts as a facilitator of the hepatic resolution process by reducing the inflammatory component of obesity-induced .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913263>Non-invasive assessment of NAFLD as systemic disease-A machine learning perspective.</a></h2><p>Current non-invasive scores for the assessment of severity of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and identification of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () have insufficient performance to be included in clinical routine. In the current study, we developed a novel machine learning approach to overcome the caveats of existing approaches.Non-invasive parameters were selected by an ensemble feature selection (EFS) from a retrospectively collected training cohort of 164 obese individuals (age: 43.5±10.3y; BMI: 54.1±10.1kg/) to develop a model able to predict the histological assessed NAFLD activity score (NAS). The model was evaluated in an independent validation cohort (122 patients, age: 45.2±11.75y, BMI: 50.8±8.61kg/).EFS identified age, γGT, HbA1c, adiponectin, and M30 as being highly associated with NAFLD. The model reached a Spearman correlation coefficient with the NAS of 0.46 in the training cohort and was able to differentiate between NAFL (NAS≤4) and  (NAS>4) with an AUC of 0.73. In the independent validation cohort, an AUC of 0.7 was achieved for this separation. We further analyzed the potential of the new model for disease monitoring in an obese cohort of 38 patients under lifestyle intervention for one year. While all patients lost weight under intervention, increasing scores were observed in 15 patients. Increasing scores were associated with significantly lower absolute weight loss, lower reduction of waist circumference and basal metabolic rate.A newly developed model (http://CHek.heiderlab.de) can predict presence or absence of  with reasonable performance. The new score could be used to detect  and monitor disease progression or therapy response to weight loss interventions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7295297>Polymorphism of kidney pyruvate kinase in the mouse is determined by a gene, Pk-3, on chromosome 9.</a></h2><p>An electrophoretically detectable variant of pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) has been found in the house mouse Mus musculus.

Current influenza vaccines for poultry are expensive and subtype specific, and therefore there is an urgent need to develop a universal avian influenza vaccine. We have constructed a live bacterial vaccine against avian influenza by expressing a conserved peptide from the ectodomain of  antigen (M2e) on the surface of Lactococcus lactis (LL). Chickens were vaccinated intranasally with the lactococcal vaccine (LL-M2e) or subcutaneously with keyhole-limpet-hemocyanin conjugated M2e (KLH-M2e). Vaccinated and nonvaccinated birds were challenged with high pathogenic avian influenza virus A subtype H5N2. Birds vaccinated with LL-M2e or KLH-M2e had median survival times of 5.5 and 6.0 days, respectively, which were significantly longer than non-vaccinated birds (3.5 days). Birds vaccinated subcutaneously with KLH-M2e had a lower mean viral burden than either of the other two groups. However, there was a significant correlation between the time of survival and M2e-specific serum IgG. The results of these trials show that birds in both vaccinated groups had significantly (P < 0.05) higher median survival times than non-vaccinated birds and that this protection could be due to M2e-specific serum IgG.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8306332>Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of ormaplatin (tetraplatin, NSC 363812) administered on a day 1 and day 8 schedule.</a></h2><p>Ormaplatin (tetraplatin, NSC 363812) is a platinum(IV) analogue that is active against cisplatin-resistant cell lines in preclinical models.

Ormaplatin was administered over a dose range of 4.4-60.8 mg/ i.v. given over 30 min on a day 1 and day 8 schedule every 28 days. Twenty-three patients had received prior chemotherapy, and the median performance status was 1. Nausea/vomiting (> or = grade 2) occurred in 40% of patients but was well controlled with standard antiemetic therapy. One patient had grade 2 renal toxicity and 1 patient had grade 3 hepatotoxicity (grade 2 pretreatment). No toxicity limited the dose given during the first course. With repeated drug administration delayed severe neurotoxicity developed in 4 patients, manifested as a sensory polyneuropathy in 3 patients and a possible autonomic neuropathy in one. Prospective nerve conduction studies did not detect subclinical neuropathy prior to the onset of symptoms. Patients who received cumulative doses above 200 mg/ were at increased risk for developing neurotoxicity. Plasma elimination of ultrafilterable platinum (measured by atomic absorption spectrometry) was biphasic with a harmonic mean terminal half-life of 15.8 h. The mean total body clearance and renal clearance of ultrafilterable platinum were 173 and 29.8 ml/min/, respectively. Thus, renal clearance accounted for 16% of total clearance suggesting that extensive protein/tissue binding was responsible for the majority of platinum clearance. Approximately 60% of the platinum is protein bound (one-half irreversibly) at the end of the infusion. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not dose dependent. No pharmacokinetic parameters were more predictive of neurotoxicity than the cumulative ormaplatin dose.

Macrophages are the paramount cell population in the field of metabolism-related inflammation; as obesity progresses, a switch takes place within the AT environment from an -alternatively activated macrophage state to an M1-inflammatory macrophage-dominated milieu. M1-polarized macrophages secrete inflammatory cytokines like TNF in the obese AT; such cytokines contribute to insulin resistance in adipocytes. Besides macrophages, also CD8+ T cells promote inflammation in the AT and the liver and thereby the deterioration of the metabolic balance in adipocytes and hepatocytes. Other cells of the innate immunity, such as neutrophils or mast cells, interfere with metabolic homeostasis as well. On the other hand, eosinophils or T-regulatory cells, the number of which in the AT decreases in the course of obesity, function to maintain metabolic balance by ameliorating inflammatory processes. In addition, eosinophils and -polarized macrophages may contribute to "beige" adipogenesis under lean conditions; beige adipocytes are located predominantly in the subcutaneous AT and have thermogenic and optimal energy-dispensing properties like brown adipocytes. This chapter will summarize the different aspects of the regulation of homeostasis of metabolic tissues by immune cells.</p></html>
