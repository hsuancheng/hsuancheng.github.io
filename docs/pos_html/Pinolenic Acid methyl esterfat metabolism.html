All nine oxidation products, monohydroperoxides from AO-MLn (I) or from PO-MLn (II), dihydroperoxides from PO-MLo (III), AO-MLn (IV) or PO-MLn (V), hydroperoxy epidioxides from PO-MLo (VI), AO-MLn (VII) or PO-MLn (VIII) and hydroperoxy bis-epidioxides from PO-MLn (IX), were weakly mutagenic in strains TA97 and/or TA100. The hydroperoxy epidioxides (VI-IX) exhibited significantly greater activity in strain TA97 than did the monohydroperoxides (I, II) or the dihydroperoxides (III-V). In strain TA100, all of the oxidation products tested exhibited similar activity. No major differences between products derived from autoxidized and photooxidized MLn (I v. II, IV v. V, VII v. VIII) were obtained. Rat-liver S-9 reduced the toxicity of all oxidation products to the tester strains. The greatest mutant yields were usually obtained in the presence of S-9, but mutagenic potency was sometimes greater without S-9. The structural feature common to all of the mutagenic oxidation products was the presence of a hydroperoxy group, suggesting that this characteristic is responsible for the observed mutagenicity, either directly or through a common degradative pathway to reactive products of lower molecular weight.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8511974>Carotenoid scavenging of radicals. Effect of carotenoid structure and oxygen partial pressure on antioxidative activity.</a></h1><p>Carotenoid scavenging of free radicals has been investigated in peroxidizing methyl esters of unsaturated fatty acids using (i) metmyoglobin as a water-based free-radical initiator in a heterogeneous /water system, and (ii) azo-bis-isobutyronitrile as a free-radical initiator in a homogeneous chloroform solution. For the heterogeneous system, using a combination of electrochemical oxygen depletion measurements, spectrophotometric determination of  hydroperoxides and carotenoid degradation, it was demonstrated that each of the four carotenoids astaxanthin, beta-carotene, canthaxanthin, and zeaxanthin protects the methyl esters against oxidation. The antioxidative effect increases with increasing carotenoid concentration, increases with decreasing oxygen partial pressure (0.010 < pO2 < 0.50 atm), and shows little dependence on the structure of the carotenoid. For a homogeneous solution, the effect of the structure of the carotenoid was further investigated, and it was shown that the stability of the four carotenoids in the oxidizing system are different, with the order of decreasing stability being: astaxanthin > canthaxanthin > beta-carotene > zeaxanthin. Each of the four carotenoids can suppress  oxidation and the degree of suppression of peroxidation of methyl linoleate corresponds to the difference in stability.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32915>Participation of superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals in NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase-catalyzed peroxidation of .</a></h1><p>1. NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase-catalyzed peroxidation of  is inhibited by superoxide dismutase, catalase, ethanol, and mannitol, and is potentiated by H2O2. 2. H2O2 is shown to be generated in the incubation mixture in the presence of NADPH and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. If the system contains Fe-EDTA complex, H2O2 is not formed. In the presence of the enzyme and Fe-EDTA complex, added H2O2 is consumed. 3. In the presence of Fe-EDTA complex, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase is shown to generate O-2 at a slow rate. These results suggest that H2O2 produced from O-2 is decomposed to form OH . by the action of Fe-EDTA complex in the  peroxidation system, and that OH . is a trigger of  peroxidation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7954362>Oxidative DNA damage induced by potassium bromate in isolated rat renal proximal tubules and renal nuclei.</a></h1><p>Oxidative damage caused by potassium bromate (KBrO3), a rat renal carcinogen, was investigated using in vitro preparations of rat renal proximal tubules (RPT) and renal nuclear fractions. Release of lactate dehydrogenase and decrease of SH-group content in RPT (1 mg protein/ml) by KBrO3 (0.5-5 mM) in a concentration- and time-dependent manner were observed. Peroxidized arachidonic acid and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) levels in RPT were increased after administration of 2 and 5 mM KBrO3. 8-OH-dG formation was observed after incubation of renal nuclei with a -peroxiding system, autooxidized , or KBrO3. These findings provide support for involvement of  peroxidation in producing oxidized DNA damage by KBrO3 directly to RPT, the target site for renal carcinogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16294926>4-oxo-2-hexenal, a mutagen formed by omega-3  peroxidation, causes DNA adduct formation in mouse organs.</a></h1><p>To identify mutagens formed in a model reaction of  peroxidation,  and hemin were reacted with dG. As a result, a 4-oxo-2-hexenal-dG adduct (dG*) was identified in the model reaction mixture. The 4-oxo-2-hexenal (4-OHE) showed mutagenic activity in the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and TA104. After 4-OHE was orally administered to mice, dG, 4-OHE-dC- and 4-OHE-5-methyl-dC adducts were detected in esophageal, stomach and intestinal DNA. In the vapor phase released from the -hemin model system, and in the smoke released during the broiling of fish, 4-OHE was detected by GCMS. The 4-OHE seems to be produced by the auto-oxidation of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. These results provide a warning to workers dealing with omega-3 fats, who may be exposed to this volatile mutagen.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23196220>Statistical optimization of culture media for growth and  production of Chlorella protothecoides UTEX 250.</a></h1><p>The concentration of NaNO(3), MgSO(4) · 7H(2)O and proteose, in Chlorella protothecoides medium were optimized for algal biomass and  production by using response surface methodology with Box-Behnken design. The optimal concentrations were 0.45 g/L of NaNO(3), 6 mg/L of MgSO(4) · 7H(2)O, and 0.25 g/L of proteose for maximum biomass production and 2 mg/L of MgSO(4) · 7H(2)O and no addition of NaNO(3) and proteose for  accumulation. In optimized biomass production medium, a final biomass concentration of 1.19 g/L was obtained, which was 1.8 times higher than that in the original medium. For  accumulation, a 12.9%  content was obtained from the biomass in the  production medium, which was three times higher than that from the original medium. The fatty acid profile of algae grown in the optimized medium demonstrated a higher unsaturated fatty acid content (i.e. methyl linoleate (C18:2) and  (C18:3)) than that of the algae grown in the original medium. The results provide a strategy for limiting the amount of nutrients required in large scale outdoor cultivation systems of C. protothecoides to make the production of algal biomass more economically attractive.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Total volatiles were also determined as a measure of overall  peroxidation. Samples of headspace taken from sealed serum bottles incubated at 37 degrees C were injected into a gas chromatograph. It was possible to make 15 determinations per hour. This method is convenient because no special sample manipulations are necessary. The addition of 0.5 mM ascorbic acid prior to gas chromatographic analysis significantly increased hexanal production. The applicability of the method was demonstrated in studies of the effect of iron in the presence or absence of hydroperoxides of methyl linoleate and  and tert-butyl hydroperoxide on rat liver homogenates, slices and microsomes. A rapid silica cartridge chromatographic procedure was used to purify hydroperoxides from autoxidized methyl linoleate and , and hydroperoxy epidioxides (cyclic peroxides) from autoxidized  in 20-40 mg quantities. The hydroperoxides and hydroperoxy epidioxides of  were effective inducers of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation in liver homogenates. Hexanal and thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances were significantly correlated in liver homogenates and microsomes but not in slices. This specific method for hexanal, a known product of peroxidation of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, can be used as a good measure of  peroxidation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1263777>Nutritional effects of the cyclic monomers of  in the rat.</a></h1><p>Low levels (0.0075, 0.0225, and 0.15%) of cyclic fatty acid methyl esters (greater than 98% pure) were incorporated into diets of weanling rats fed different levels of protein. Animals on low protein diets (8-10% casein) exhibited decreased wt gains and feed consumption with increasing levels of cyclic esters in their diets after 6 weeks. Liver enlargements due to a significant (P less than 0.01) accumulation of liver lipid were noted in animals receiving 0.15% cyclic fatty acid esters in their diets.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3586859>Fluorescence formation and heme degradation at different stages of  peroxidation.</a></h1><p>Secondary oxidative products of autoxidized methyl linoleate were divided into three groups (SP-I, SP-II and SP-III), which were then compared as to their abilities to form fluorescent substances and to degrade heme. SP-III showed a marked ability to produce two fluorescent substances exhibiting an excitation maximum at 350-360 nm and an emission maximum at 410-430 nm, while SP-I showed a more strongly degradative effect on heme than SP-III. The heme degradation was observed in parallel with the changes of TBA value in an early stage of  peroxidation and the fluorescence formation markedly increased according to the decrease of TBA value in a later stage. The results suggested that there are different reactive substances which bring about fluorescence formation and heme degradation and that they are produced at different stages of  peroxidation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19322028>Lotus (Nelumbo nuficera) flower essential oil increased melanogenesis in normal human melanocytes.</a></h1><p>In this study, the essential oil from lotus flower extract, including petals and stamens, was assessed with regard to its effects on melanogenesis in human melanocytes. The lotus flower essential oil was shown to stimulate melanin synthesis and tyrosinase activity in a dose-dependent manner. The lotus flower essential oil induced the expression of tyrosinase, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor M (MITF-M), and tyrosinase-related proten-2 (TRP-2) proteins, but not tyrosinase mRNA. Moreover, it increased the phosphorylation of ERK and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). In order to verify the effective components of the lotus flower oil, its  composition was assessed. It was found to be comprised of palmitic acid methyl ester (22.66%), linoleic acid methyl ester (11.16%), palmitoleic acid methyl ester (7.55%) and  (5.16%). Among these components, palmitic acid methyl ester clearly induced melanogenesis as the result of increased tyrosinase expression, thereby indicating that it may play a role in the regulation of melanin content. Thus, our results indicate that lotus flower oil may prove useful in the development of gray hair prevention agents or tanning reagents.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20110888>Inhibition of oxidation of aqueous emulsions of omega-3 fatty acids and fish oil by phloretin and phloridzin.</a></h1><p>The antioxidant properties of two apple dihydrochalcones, namely phloretin and phloridzin, were evaluated and compared with those of alpha-tocopherol and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). The effects were studied in an oil-in-water emulsion system containing  (ML), methyl eicosapentaenoate (MEPA), and methyl docosahexaenoate (MDHA) in which oxidation was initiated by the peroxyl radical generator 2,2-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) and in fish oil where oxidation was initiated thermally. In the emulsion system, phloretin (1 and 5 mM) completely inhibited the oxidation of ML tested as evidenced by the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay. Under the same conditions, phloridzin was less effective than phloretin, but still more effective than alpha-tocopherol. Both phloretin and phloridzin molecules had a marginal inhibitory effect against oxidation of fish oil induced by heating at 70 degrees C for 3 hours, when compared to BHT. These results indicate that phloretin and phloridzin have the potential to suppress  oxidation in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) containing foods.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/628317>Linolenic acid deficiency: changes in fatty acid patterns in female and male rats raised on a linolenic acid-deficient diet for two generations.</a></h1><p>Rats were fed for two generations a purified, linolenic acid-deficient diet in which the only source of  was purified methyl linoleate. This diet contained about 38 mg linolenic acid/kg diet. Control rats were given the same diet supplemented with  (2,500 mg/kg diet). Male and female rats ranged in age from weaning pups to adults. Lipids were extracted from liver, brain, kidney, spleen, heart, muscle, gastrointestinal tract, lung, ovary, testis, adrenal, plasma, erythrocytes, retina, and adipose tissue. Fatty acids of major phospholipid classes (choline phosphoglycerides, ethanolamine phosphoglycerides, and mixed serine phosphoglycerides plus inositol phosphoglycerides) or of total  extracts were measured by gas liquid chromatography. Growth rates and organ weights were similar in control and linolenic acid-deficient rats. The major effect of the deficiency was to lower the proportions of n-3 fatty acids, especially 22:6 n-3, in all the organs analyzed. Docosahexaenoic acid (22:6 n-3) was mainly replaced by 22:5 n-6 in deficient rats. The greatest changes in composition were found in brain, heart, muscle, retina, and liver.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1898503>Interaction of C-nitroso aromatics with polyunsaturated fatty acids: route to  peroxidation.</a></h1><p>The possibility that the interaction of C-nitroso aromatics with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) causes  peroxidation was investigated through determination of conjugated diene and malodialdehyde (MDA) formation after anaerobic/aerobic vs. aerobic incubations of nitrosobenzene (NOB) or 2-nitrosofluorene (2-NOF) with linoleic, linolenic or arachidonic acid or . Anaerobic incubation of NOB or 2-NOF with linolenic acid at the molar ratio of 1:1 for 24 h yielded approximately 5.5-13% of the PUFA as conjugated diene which appeared stable upon exposure to air. Interaction of PUFA and 2-NOF or NOB yielded MDA, the amounts of which were significantly greater when 24-h anaerobic preceded 1-6-h aerobic incubation. Furthermore, the differences in the amounts of MDA resulting from 24- and 0-h anaerobic incubations were significantly greater when the molar ratio of 2-NOF (or NOB) to PUFA was increased (2.0 greater than 1.0 greater than 0.5). Superoxide dismutase or catalase had no effect on the yields of MDA following either anaerobic/aerobic or aerobic incubations of PUFA and 2-NOF. EDTA (1 or 10 microM) had no effect on the yields of MDA from aerobic incubations, but it decreased the amounts of MDA (by approximately 30 or 60%, respectively) from anaerobic/aerobic incubations. The data suggested that inhibition by EDTA was due to chelation of trace iron, which following anaerobic interaction of PUFA and 2-NOF might have been reduced to Fe2+ and contributed to the enhanced  peroxidation. Thus, adduction of C-nitroso aromatics to PUFA yields radical species which directly and/or via reaction with trace iron lead to  peroxidation. The lipophilicity of C-nitroso aromatics suggests that this process may be of consequence in their mutagenesis/carcinogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10639127>Modifications of proteins by polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation products.</a></h1><p>The ability of unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters to modify amino acid residues in bovine serum albumin (BSA), glutamine synthetase, and insulin in the presence of a metal-catalyzed oxidation system [ascorbate/Fe(III)/O(2)] depends on the degree of unsaturation of the fatty acid. The fatty acid-dependent generation of carbonyl groups and loss of lysine residues increased in the order methyl linoleate <  < methyl arachidonate. The amounts of alkyl hydroperoxides, malondialdehyde, and a number of other aldehydes that accumulated when polyunsaturated fatty acids were oxidized in the presence of BSA were significantly lower than that observed in the absence of BSA. Direct treatment of proteins with various  hydroperoxides led to a slight increase in the formation of protein carbonyl derivatives, whereas treatment with the hydroperoxides together with Fe(II) led to a substantial increase in the formation of protein carbonyls. These results are consistent with the proposition that metal-catalyzed oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids can contribute to the generation of protein carbonyls by direct interaction of  oxidation products (alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes) with lysine residues (Michael addition reactions) and also by interactions with alkoxyl radicals obtained by Fe(II) cleavage of  hydroperoxides that are formed. In addition, saturated aldehydes derived from the polyunsaturated fatty acids likely react with lysine residues to form Schiff base adducts.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3190239>The biphasic effect of calcium on  peroxidation.</a></h1><p>Mechanisms underlying Ca2+ effects on  peroxidation (LPO) induced in liposomes (from egg yolk lecithin) and ufasomes (from linolenic acid and ) with the aid of an O2-(.) -generating system (Fe2+ + ascorbate) were studied. It was shown that stimulation of LPO by low Ca2+ concentrations (10(-6)-10(-5)M) was due to its ability to release Fe2+ ions bound to negatively charged (phosphate or carboxylic)  groups (of lecithin or linolenic acid), thus increasing the concentration of catalytically active Fe2+. The inhibitory effect of high Ca2+ concentrations was caused by its interaction with superoxide anion radicals and was not observed in LPO systems independent of O2- generation (e.g., Fe2+ + cumol hydroperoxide).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/851547>Depletion of docosahexaenoic acid in retinal lipids of rats fed a linolenic acid-deficient, linoleic acid-containing diet.</a></h1><p>Rats were raised for 2 generations on a diet in which 1.25% methyl linoleate was the only source of . Control rats were given 1.0% methyl linoleate plus 0.25% . Lipids were extracted from retinas and their fatty acids were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. Docosahexaenoic acid accounted for 33.8% of total fatty acids in control retinas, for 13% of fatty acids in first-generation deficient retinas, and for 2.7% of fatty acids in second-generation deficient retinas.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1315708> peroxidation products mediate the formation of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine in DNA.</a></h1><p>Membrane  peroxidation processes yield products that may react with DNA to cause oxidative modifications. We have investigated this possibility and have found that calf thymus DNA exposed to autooxidized lipids causes the formation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG). 8-OH-dG formation in DNA was measured using high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection.  oxidized for different lengths of time was exposed to DNA. The amount of 8-OH-dG formed in DNA was proportional to the amount of  peroxidation as measured by the thiobarbituric reactive substances present. The formation of 8-OH-dG in DNA by autooxidized  was dependent on the presence of the transition metal ions Cu or Fe and was inhibited by various scavengers, including superoxide dismutase and catalase. This implicates the involvement of oxygen free radicals in the process. Liposomes formed from phosphatidylcholine (82%) and methyl arachidonate (18%) were peroxidized for different lengths of time and then exposed to DNA. 8-OH-dG was formed in DNA by exposure to Cu(II) and peroxidized liposomes. Under these conditions, Fe(III) was slightly less effective than Cu(II) in mediating 8-OH-dG formation. These observations clearly show that 8-OH-dG formation in DNA may result from processes that may occur during intracellular  peroxidation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7381608>Effects of linolenic acid deficiency on the fatty acid patterns in plasma and liver cholesteryl esters, triglycerides and phospholipids in female rats.</a></h1><p>These experiments were performed to measure the effects of linolenate deficiency upon neutral lipids of plasma and liver, and to search for a metabolic interaction between dietary choline and linolenic acid. Rats were fed for two generations on a linolenic acid-deficient diet containing methyl linoleate as the only source of . Control rats were supplemented with . Second-generation linolenate-deficient rats and control rats were fed low-methionine, choline-deficient diets for 2 weeks. Half the animals in each group were given choline-supplemented diets. Plasma and liver total cholesterol, esterified cholesterol, triglyceride and major phospholipid classes, and the fatty acids of these classes were measured. Linolenic acid deficiency reduced the concentrations of plasma triglycerides in both choline-deficient and choline-supplemented rats. Evidence for a metabolic interaction between choline and linolenic acid was not obtained because the rats responded very weakly to the choline deficiency. Linolenate deficiency reduced the proportions of n-3 fatty acids, particularly 22:6n-3, in all the lipids analyzed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18406660>4-oxo-2-hexenal, a mutagen formed by omega-3  peroxidation: occurrence, detection and adduct formation.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this review is to summarize our recent studies of a novel mutagen, 4-oxo-2-hexenal. To identify the mutagens formed in a model reaction of  peroxidation,  and hemin were reacted with dG. A 4-oxo-2-hexenal-dG adduct (dG*) was identified in the model reaction mixture. The 4-oxo-2-hexenal (4-OHE) showed mutagenic activity in the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and TA104. 4-OHE reacts with DNA to form dG, dC, and 5-methyl-dC(5-Me-dC)-adducts (dG*, dC*, 5-Me-dC*) in vitro. After 4-OHE was orally administered to mice, these adducts were detected in esophageal, stomach and intestinal DNA by liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS). We also confirmed the formation of 4-OHE during the heat processing of edible vegetable oil, and during cooking. It was present at an especially high concentration in broiled saury. 4-OHE is probably generated by the oxidation of omega-3 fats. These results provide a warning to humans, who may be exposed to this mutagen. Since 4-OHE induces DNA adduct formation in experimental animal organs, further studies on the carcinogenicity of 4-OHE and the detection of 4-OHE-DNA adducts in human tissue will be required.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3933548>Reactions of proteins with oxidizing lipids. 2. Influence on protein quality and on the bioavailability of lysine, methionine, cyst(e)ine and tryptophan as measured in rat assays.</a></h1><p>The consequences of reactions between protein and oxidizing lipids on the nutritional quality of food proteins have been investigated using a whey protein--water model system. In rat assays, significant reductions were observed in protein efficiency ratio, net protein ratio, net protein utilization, biological value and true nitrogen digestibility, especially when the reaction had taken place at high moisture content, high temperature and in the presence of excess oxygen. The losses of bioavailable lysine and tryptophan as measured by rat assays followed a similar pattern. The chemical value of each amino acid multiplied by the true N digestibility closely resembled the rat assay value. In general, the reaction products of lysine and tryptophan formed during  oxidation were biologically unavailable. The bioavailabilities of methionine and of 'methionine plus cyst(e)ine' were determined in separate assays. Cyst(e)ine was calculated as 'methionine plus cyst(e)ine' minus methionine. In whey protein which had reacted with oxidizing , the bioavailable methionine content was not significantly reduced even though 82% of the methionine residues were present as methionine sulphoxide. In hydrogen peroxide-treated casein in which all methionine residues were oxidized to the sulphoxide, methionine sulphoxide was found to be 96% as utilizable as a methionine source to the rat. Free methionine sulphoxide was 87% utilizable. Cyst(e)ine appeared to be as sensitive as lysine to reactions with  oxidation products. In whey protein which had reacted with oxidizing , the bioavailabilities of cyst(e)ine, lysine, tryptophan and methionine were reduced by 28, 24, 11 and 8% respectively and true N digestibility by 9%.
