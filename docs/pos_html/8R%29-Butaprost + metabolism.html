<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8448586>Potentiation of aggregation and inhibition of adenylate cyclase in human platelets by prostaglandin E analogues.</a></h2><p>1. The 16-phenoxy prostaglandin E analogue sulprostone consistently potentiates primary aggregation waves induced by adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), PAF and 11,9-epoxymethano PGH2 (U-46619) in platelet-rich plasma from human donors. The effect is not blocked by the TP-receptor antagonists, EP 092 and GR 32191. The high potency of sulprostone (threshold concentration = 4-10 nM) and the weak block of sulprostone potentiation by the EP1-receptor antagonist, AH 6809 (pA2 = 4.3) suggest the involvement of EP3-receptors as opposed to EP1- or EP2-subtypes. 2. Eight prostaglandin E (PGE) analogues were compared against sulprostone for their effects on PAF-induced aggregation in human platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in the presence of GR 32191 and the DP-receptor antagonist, BW A868C. PGE2 and 11-deoxy PGE2-1-alcohol showed evidence of both potentiating and inhibitory actions and  showed only inhibitory activity at high concentrations. The remaining analogues always elicited potentiation, with the following potency ranking: sulprostone = 16,16-dimethyl PGE2 > MB 28767 > misoprostol > GR 63779X = 17-phenyl-omega-trinor PGE2. The results again indicate that EP3- rather than EP1- or EP2-receptors are involved. However, relative potentiating potency could be affected by differences in plasma protein binding and the very high sensitivity of the human platelet to prostacyclin (IP)-receptor-mediated inhibition (IC50 for the specific IP-receptor agonist cicaprost = 0.8 nM). 3. On human washed platelet suspensions the PGE analogues, with the exception of ,inhibited the rise in adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) induced by cicaprost (8 nM).PGE2 produced a monophasic inhibition curve (IC50 = 5.4 nM, 92% inhibition at 600 nM). The potency ranking was 16,16-dimethyl PGE2> sulprostone>MB 28767 = PGE2> misoprostol> GR 63778X>17-phenyl-w-trinor PGE2> 1 1-deoxy PGE2-1-alcohol. AH 6809 inhibited the effect of sulprostone and 17-phenyl-c-trinor PGE2 with pA2 values of 5.75 and 5.32 respectively; these values are at least one log unit lower than those found for EP1-receptor block in smooth muscle.4. There is a statistically significant correlation between IC50 values for the PGE analogues on the human platelet cyclic AMP assay and the guinea-pig vas deferens (standard EP3 preparation): slope =1.00,  = 0.80, P <0.05. However the correlation is far from ideal and GR 63779X in particular has a lower potency in the cyclic AMP assay. At this time we suggest that it is prudent to describe the human platelet receptor as 'EP3-like'.5. We believe that our results provide further evidence for linking PGE-induced potentiation of aggregation to inhibition of adenylate cyclase. Sulprostone is a suitable agonist for further study of this system and in particular the nature of the G-protein linkage(s) involved. In addition the necessity to consider potentiation of platelet aggregation in -relation to the clinical use of PGE analogues in man is emphasised.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26277839>Regulation of Expression of Renal Organic Anion Transporters OAT1 and OAT3 in a Model of Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury.</a></h2><p>Recently, we gained evidence that impairment of rOat1 and rOat3 expression induced by ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI) is mediated by COX metabolites and this suppression might be critically involved in renal damage.(i) Basolateral organic anion uptake into proximal tubular cells after model ischemia and reperfusion (I/) was investigated by fluorescein uptake. The putative promoter sequences from hOAT1 (SLC22A6) and hOAT3 (SCL22A8) were cloned into a reporter plasmid, transfected into HEK cells and (ii) transcriptional activity was determined after model ischemia and reperfusion as a SEAP reporter gen assay. Inhibitors or antagonists were applied with the beginning of reperfusion.By using inhibitors of PKA (H89) and PLC (U73122), antagonists of E prostanoid receptor type 2 (AH6809) and type 4 (L161,982), we gained evidence that I/ induced down regulation of organic anion transport is mediated by COX1 metabolites via E prostanoid receptor type 4. The latter signaling was confirmed by application of  (EP2 agonist) or TCS2510 (EP4 agonist) to control cells. In brief, the latter signaling was verified for the transcriptional activity in the reporter gen assay established. Therein, selective inhibitors for COX1 (SC58125) and COX2 (SC560) were also applied.Our data show (a) that COX1 metabolites are involved in the regulation of renal organic anion transport(ers) after I/ via the EP4 receptor and (b) that this is due to transcriptional regulation of the respective transporters. As the promoter sequences cloned were of human origin and expressed in a human renal epithelial cell line we (c) hypothesize that the regulatory mechanisms described after I/ is meaningful for humans as well.© 2015 S.

(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 7759-7762]. However, it is not sensitive to one of the EP2 agonists, . Recently another subtype of PGE receptor coupled to adenylate cyclase has been identified pharmacologically and named EP4. These findings have led us to examine whether the cloned receptor is the EP4 subtype. AH23848B, a selective EP4 antagonist, not only displaced the [3H]PGE2 binding to the cloned receptor but antagonized the PGE2-stimulated cAMP formation in the receptor. In contrast, EP2 specific agonist,  and 19()OH-PGE2 neither bound to the receptor nor stimulated the cAMP formation. These results suggest that this receptor previously reported as 'EP2' subtype is identical to the pharmacologically defined EP4 subtype and not of EP2 subtype.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8590276>Molecular characterization and ocular hypotensive properties of the prostanoid EP2 receptor.</a></h2><p>The cloning of the genes that encode for prostaglandin (PG) receptors has resolved much of the complexity and controversy in this area by confirming the classification proposed by Coleman, et al. Two issues that remained unresolved were (1) the inability of the EP2 agonist  to interact with the cloned putative EP2 receptor and (2) molecular biological confirmation of a fourth PGE2-sensitive receptor, which was pharmacologically designated EP4. In order to provide clarification, we attempted to clone further PGE2-sensitive receptors. By using a cDNA probe that encodes for the human EP3A receptor, a cDNA clone that encoded for a novel PGE2-sensitive receptor was obtained by screening a human placenta library. This cDNA clone was transfected into COS-7 cells for pharmacological studies. The cDNA clone obtained from human placenta had only about 30% amino acid identity with cDNAs for other PG receptors, including those that encode for the previously proposed murine and human EP2 receptors. Radioligand binding studies on the novel EP receptor expressed in COS-7 cells revealed that selective EP2 agonists such as , AH 13205, AY 23626 and 19()-OH PGE2 all competed with 3H-PGE2 for its binding sites, whereas selective agonists for other PG receptor subtypes had minimal or no effect. This receptor was coupled to adenylate cyclase and EP2 agonists caused dose-related increases in cAMP. It appears that the cDNA described herein encodes for the pharmacologically defined EP2 receptor. Ocular studies revealed that AH 13205 decreased intraocular pressure in normal and ocular hypertensive monkeys by a mechanism that does not appear to involve inhibition of aqueous humor secretion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20960188>Receptor desensitization and blockade of the suppressive effects of prostaglandin E(2) and adenosine on the cytotoxic activity of human melanoma-infiltrating T lymphocytes.</a></h2><p>Previous studies document that PGE(2) and adenosine suppress production of inflammatory cytokines. The present study demonstrates for the first time that (1) PGE(2) and 2-chloroadenosine (CADO; a stable analog of adenosine) directly inhibit the cytolytic function of human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs); (2) the combination PGE(2) and CADO have additive suppressive effects; and (3) the cooperative immunosuppressive actions of PGE(2) and CADO are mediated via EP2 receptors (EP2Rs) and A(2A) receptors (A(2A)Rs) and are due to amplification of cAMP production, activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and T cell receptor (TCR) inhibitor Csk leading to inhibition of Lck, ZAP-70 and Akt phosphorylation. (4) During ex vivo expansion, TILs undergo three stages of differentiation converting from TILs with high cytotoxic activity and relative resistance to combined EP2R/A(2A) suppression (stage I) to TILs retaining high cytotoxicity and gaining sensitivity to combined suppression (stage II) and then to TILS that are less cytotoxic and very sensitive to combined suppression (stage III). (5) Finally, we find that pretreatment of TILs with non-inhibitory concentrations of EP2R agonists (such as PGE(2) or ) or A(2A) agonists (such as CADO or CGS21680) increases their cytotoxic activity and induces resistance to EP2R and A(2A) inhibitory signaling (cross-resistance) due to homologous and heterologous desensitization and internalization of EP2Rs and A(2A)Rs, thus preventing their inhibitory signaling. We conclude that inducing resistance of TILs to the suppressive effects of PGE(2) and adenosine in the tumor microenvironment could represent a novel strategy for improving the efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8680723>Investigation of the inhibitory effects of PGE2 and selective EP agonists on chemotaxis of human neutrophils.</a></h2><p>1. The aims of this study were to investigate the inhibitory effects of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on chemotaxis of N-formyl-methionyl-leucine-phenylalanine (FMLP)-stimulated human neutrophils, and to test the hypothesis that cyclic AMP is the second messenger involved. For this purpose, the inhibitory effect of selective EP agonists, and the modulatory effects of the adenylate cyclase inhibitor, SQ 22536, the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitors H-89 and Rp-cAMPs, and the type IV phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors, rolipram and Ro20-1724 have been examined. 2. Chemotaxis has been measured using blindwell chambers. When human neutrophils were stimulated with FMLP (100 nM), PGE2 inhibited chemotaxis in a concentration-dependent manner (0.01-10 microM), with an EC50 of 90 +/- 24.5 nM, a maximum effect ranging from 45-75% and a mean inhibition of 64.5 +/- 2.4%. 3. The EP2-receptor agonists, 11-deoxy PGE1,  and AH 13205 also inhibited chemotaxis. The order of potency of these agonists was PGE2 >  (EC50 = 106.4 +/- 63 nM) > 11-deoxy PGE1 (EC50 = 140.9 +/- 64.7 nM) > AH 13205 (EC50 = 1.58 +/- 0.73 microM). Correlation of the ability of EP2 agonists to increase cyclic AMP and to inhibit chemotaxis was poor ( = 0.38). 4. The IP agonist, cicaprost gave similar increases in cyclic AMP to those achieved with PGE2, yet produced 50% of the maximum inhibition of chemotaxis observed with PGE2. 5. Slight potentiation of the inhibitory effects of PGE2 after type IV PDE block was observed with rolipram (EC50 for PGE2 = 57.2 +/- 5.9; 35.2 +/- 6.8 nM) but not Ro20-1724 (EC50 for PGE2 = 216.0 +/- 59.7; 97.8 +/- 50.6 nM). Type IV PDE inhibitors are themselves potent inhibitors of chemotaxis with EC50 values of 23.0 +/- 2.3 and 73.6 +/- 10.3 nM for rolipram and Ro20-1724, respectively. 6. Inhibition of cyclic AMP production with the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ 22,536 (0.1 mM) failed to antagonize inhibition of chemotaxis by PGE2 (EC50s for PGE2 of 57.2 +/- 5.9 and 56.8 +/- 27.3 nM, in the absence and presence of SQ 22,536, respectively) despite a reduction in the increase in cyclic AMP induced by PGE2. 7. Inhibition of PKA with either H-89 (10 microM) or Rp cyclic AMPS (10 microM) similarly failed to antagonize inhibition of chemotaxis by PGE2; EC50 for PGE2 of 90 +/- 40 and PGE2 + H-89 60 +/- 17 nM; PGE2 216.0 +/- 58.7 and PGE2 + Rp cyclic AMP 76.9 +/- 14.7 nM. 8. Of the two PKA inhibitors tested, H-89 (10 microM) and Rp cyclic AMPS (10 microM), the more effective inhibitor of PGE2-induced inhibition of neutrophil superoxide anion generation was H-89 (EC50s for PGE2 were 0.36 +/- 0.1 and > 10 microM, respectively). We have previously shown this to be a cyclic AMP-dependent effect of PGE2. 9. Confirmation of block of PKA by H-89 was suggested by the finding that H-89 blocked inhibition of superoxide anion generation observed with the type IV PDE inhibitors rolipram and Ro20-1724; EC50s of 12.9 +/- 8.9 nM for rolipram alone and rolipram+H-89 > 1 microM; Ro20-1724 alone 59.5 +/- 28.1 nM and Ro20-1724 + H-89 > 1 microM. 10. The results suggest that inhibition of chemotaxis by PGE2 and EP2 agonists is not mediated by increased neutrophil cyclic AMP levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8679543>Selective regulation of RNK-16 cell matrix metalloproteinases by the EP4 subtype of prostaglandin E2 receptor.</a></h2><p>Cell surface expression of multiple structurally and functionally distinct prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptors (Rs), designated the EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 Rs, is a principal determinant of the diverse cellular effects of PGE2. The RNK-16 line of rat large granular lymphocytes, which has served as a model for natural killer cells, coexpresses a mean of 1092 EP3 Rs and EP4 Rs per cell with a mean Kd of 2.7 nM. The presence of the EP3 and EP4 Rs and the absence of the EP1 and EP2 Rs were revealed by inhibition of [3H]PGE2 binding by the EP3/EP1R agonist sulprostone, the EP3/EP2/EP4R agonist M&B 28767, and the EP2/EP4/EP3R agonist misoprostol but not by the EP1R antagonist SC-19220 or the EP2R agonist . Functional EP4  expression was confirmed by finding that PGE2 and misoprostol, but not  or sulprostone, evoked increases in the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP ([cAMP]) in RNK-16 cells. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and -3 were identified by zymography and Western blots as the principal MMPs secreted by RNK-16 cells. Secretion of both MMPs by RNK-16 cells attained a maximal level after 24 h of incubation and was enhanced significantly by 10(-9) to 10(-7) M PGE2, 10(-6) M misoprostol, and 10(-4) M dibutyryl cyclic AMP, but not by the EP3R agonist sulprostone. Thus, the effect of PGE2 on RNK-16 cell MMP secretion is mediated by an EP4 -dependent mechanism involving increases in [cAMP]i. The migration of RNK-16 cells across micropore filters, without or with a layer of Matrigel, was stimulated chemokinetically by PGE2 and misoprostol. PGE2-elicited chemokinesis of RNK-16 cells across a Matrigel model basement membrane, but not across a microfilter alone, was suppressed by the GM 6001 inhibitor of MMP activities. Stimulation of MMP activities in RNK-16 cells by the EP4R thus facilitates migration of the NK cells across vascular basement membranes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15464062>Functional pharmacology of human prostanoid EP2 and EP4 receptors.</a></h2><p>Prostanoid EP(2) and EP(4) receptor-mediated responses are difficult to distinguish pharmacologically because of the lack of potent, selective antagonists. We describe systematic agonist fingerprints for recombinant human prostanoid EP(2) and EP(4) receptors expressed in CHO and HEK293 cells, respectively. The rank orders of potency of endogenous prostaglandins were: prostanoid EP(2) receptors: prostaglandin E(2)>>prostaglandin D(2)=prostaglandin F(2alpha)>prostaglandin I(2); prostanoid EP(4) receptors: prostaglandin E(2)>>prostaglandin I(2)>prostaglandin D(2)=prostaglandin F(2alpha).  free acid (9-oxo-11alpha,16R-dihydroxy-17-cyclobutyl-prost-13E-en-1-oic acid) behaved as a highly selective partial agonist at prostanoid EP(2) receptors while  methyl ester elicited small, low potency responses. The prostanoid EP(1) and EP(3) receptor agonists misoprostol (9-oxo-11alpha,16-dihydroxy-16-methyl-prost-13E-en-1-oic acid, methyl ester), sulprostone (N-(methylsulphonyl)-9-oxo-11alpha,15R-dihydroxy-16-phenoxy-17,18,19,20-tetranor-prosta-5Z,13E-dien-1-amide), and GR63799X ([1R-[1alpha(Z),2beta(*),3alpha]-(-)-4-benzoylamino)phenyl-7-[3-hydroxy-3-phenoxy-propoxy)-5-oxocyclopentyl]-4-heptenoate), and the prostanoid DP receptor agonist BW245C ((4S)-(3-[(3R,S)-3-cyclohexyl-3-hydropropyl]-2,5-dioxo)-4-imidazolidineheptanoic acid), activated both prostanoid EP(2) and EP(4) receptors. Prostaglandin I(2), iloprost (6,9alpha-methylene-11alpha,15S-dihydroxy-16-methyl-prosta-5E,13E-dien-18-yn-1-oic acid, trometamol salt) and cicaprost (5-[(E)-(1S, 5S, 6S, 7R)-7-hydroxy-6-[(3S, 4S)-3-hydroxy-4-methylnona-1,6-diinyl]-bicyclo[3.3.0]octan-3-yliden]-3-oxapentanoic acid; ZK96480) were full agonists at prostanoid EP(4) receptors. Key differentiating agonists are:  FA, 16,16-dimethyl-prostaglandin E(2), 19-()-hydroxy prostaglandin E(2), misoprostol, BW245C, prostaglandin F(2alpha) and prostaglandin D(2).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12098672>Novel role for prostaglandin E2 in fish hepatocytes: regulation of glucose .</a></h2><p>Prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) potently activated glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in isolated rockfish (Sebastes caurinus) hepatocytes. The average degree of activation for glycogenolysis was 6.4+/-0.67-fold (mean+/-S.E.M.; n=37), and could be as much as 19-fold. Analysis of dose-concentration relationships between glycogenolytic actions and PGE(2) concentrations yielded an EC(50) around 120 nM in hepatocyte suspensions and 2 nM for hepatocytes immobilized on perifusion columns. For the activation of gluconeogenesis (1.74+/-0.14-fold; n=10), the EC(50) for suspensions was 60 nM. Intracellular targets for PGE(2) actions are adenylyl cyclase, protein kinase A and glycogen phosphorylase. Concentrations of cAMP increased with increasing concentrations of PGE(2), and peaked within 2 min of hormone application. In the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, isobutyl-3-methylxanthine, peak height was increased and peak duration extended. The protein kinase A inhibitor, Rp-cAMPS, counteracted the activation of glycogenolysis by PGE(2), implying that the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A pathway is the most important, if not exclusive, route of message transduction. PGE(2) activated plasma membrane adenylyl cyclase and hepatocyte glycogen phosphorylase in a dose-dependent manner. The effects were specific for PGE(2); smaller degrees of activation of glycogenolysis were noted for PGE(1), 11-deoxy PGE(1), 19--hydroxy-PGE(2), and prostaglandins of the A, B and Falpha-series. The selective EP(2)-receptor agonist, , was as effective as PGE(2), suggesting that rockfish liver contains prostaglandin receptors pharmacologically related to the EP(2) receptors of non-hepatic tissues of mammals. Rockfish hepatocytes quickly degraded added PGE(2) (t((1/2))=17-26 min). A similar ability to degrade PGE(2) has been noted in catfish (Ameiurus nebulosus) hepatocytes, but no glycogenolytic or gluconeogenic actions of the hormone are noted for this species. We conclude that PGE(2) is an important  hormone in fish liver, with cAMP-mediated actions on glycogen and glucose , and probably other  regulated by cAMP and protein kinase A. The constant presence of EP(2)-like receptors is a unique feature of the fish liver, with interesting implications for function and evolution of prostaglandin receptors in vertebrates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15576468>Significance of cyclooxygenase-2 induced via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in mechanical stimulus-induced peritoneal adhesion in mice.</a></h2><p>Postoperative peritoneal adhesion represents a major complication of surgery, but the molecular mechanism underlying pathogenesis of adhesion is not fully understood. The present study investigated the roles of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 in peritoneal adhesion induced by scraping the surface of the cecum and abdominal wall in mice. Slight, but macroscopically observable, peritoneal adhesion was induced even on day 1, and the extent of adhesion reached a maximum on day 7 and beyond. COX-1 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the intact cecum, and its expression level was not altered after the mechanical stimulus. In contrast, expression of the COX-2 gene was markedly increased after the stimulus, and maximum expression was observed on days 3 to 7. Mofezolac, a specific COX-1 inhibitor, had no effect on peritoneal adhesion at 30 mg/kg and had only marginal effects on prostaglandin (PG)E2 levels in the cecum or peritoneal fluid. On the other hand, two highly selective inhibitors for COX-2, NS-398 (N-[2-(cyclohexyloxy)-4-nitrophenyl]-methanesulfonamide) and CAY10404 [3-(4-methylsulphonylphenyl)-4-phenyl-5-trifluoromethylisoxazole], dose-dependently inhibited both adhesion formation and the increase in PGE2 levels (3-30 mg/kg). The effects of NS-398 were eliminated when PGE2 or ()- was administered exogenously. A COX-2 antisense oligonucleotide also attenuated adhesion formation. Activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase was observed in the traumatized cecum, and an MAP kinase inhibitor, SB202190 [4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1H-imidazole], inhibited adhesion formation (54% inhibition at 15 microM) and also reduced the COX-2 mRNA level and PGE2 levels. In conclusion, COX-2, but not COX-1, plays a significant role in mechanical stimulus-induced peritoneal formation in the mouse cecum.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25715797>EP2 Receptor Signaling Regulates Microglia Death.</a></h2><p>The timely resolution of  prevents continued tissue damage after an initial insult. In the brain, the death of activated microglia by apoptosis has been proposed as one mechanism to resolve brain . How microglial death is regulated after activation is still unclear. We reported that exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interleukin (IL)-13 together initially activates and then kills rat microglia in culture by a mechanism dependent on cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). We show here that activation of the E prostanoid receptor 2 (EP2, PTGER2) for prostaglandin E2 mediates microglial death induced by LPS/IL-13, and that EP2 activation by agonist alone kills microglia. Both EP2 antagonists and reactive oxygen scavengers block microglial death induced by either LPS/IL-13 or EP2 activation. By contrast, the homeostatic induction of heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox1) by LPS/IL-13 or EP2 activation protects microglia. Both the Hmox1 inducer cobalt protoporphyrin and a compound that releases the Hmox1 product carbon monoxide (CO) attenuated microglial death produced by LPS/IL-13. Whereas CO reduced COX-2 protein expression, EP2 activation increased Hmox1 and COX-2 expression at both the mRNA and protein level. Interestingly, caspase-1 inhibition prevented microglial death induced by either LPS/IL-13 or low (but not high) concentrations of , suggestive of a predominantly pyroptotic mode of death.  also caused the expression of activated caspase-3 in microglia, pointing to apoptosis. These results indicate that EP2 activation, which initially promotes microglial activation, later causes delayed death of activated microglia, potentially contributing to the resolution phase of neuroinflammation.Copyright © 2015 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22619251>Adenylyl cyclase 2 selectively couples to E prostanoid type 2 receptors, whereas adenylyl cyclase 3 is not receptor-regulated in airway smooth muscle.</a></h2><p>Adenylyl cyclases (ACs) are important regulators of airway smooth muscle function, because β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) agonists stimulate AC activity and cAMP production. We have previously shown in a number of cell types that AC6 selectively couples to βAR and these proteins are coexpressed in lipid rafts. We overexpressed AC2, AC3, and AC6 in mouse bronchial smooth muscle cells (mBSMCs) and human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells by using recombinant adenoviruses and assessed their localization and regulation by various G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). AC3 and AC6 were expressed primarily in caveolin-rich fractions, whereas AC2 expression was excluded from these domains. AC6 expression enhanced cAMP production in response to isoproterenol but did not increase responses to , reflecting the colocalization of AC6 with β(2)AR but not E prostanoid type 2 receptor (EP(2)) in lipid raft fractions. AC2 expression enhanced -stimulated cAMP production but had no effect on the β(2)AR-mediated response. AC3 did not couple to any GPCR tested. Forskolin-induced arborization of mBSMCs was assessed as a functional readout of cAMP signaling. Arborization was enhanced by overexpression of AC6 and AC3, but AC2 had no effect. GPCR-stimulated arborization mirrored the selective coupling observed for cAMP production. With the addition of the phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor rolipram AC2 accelerated forskolin-stimulated arborization. Thus, AC2 selectively couples to EP(2), but signals from this complex are limited by PDE4 activity. AC3 does not seem to couple to GPCR in either mBSMCs or HEK-293 cells, so it probably exists in a distinct signaling domain in these cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12773508>Prostaglandin E2 modulates dendritic cell function via EP2 and EP4 receptor subtypes.</a></h2><p>We have reported previously that PGE(2) inhibits dendritic cells (DC) functions. Because E prostanoid receptor (EPR) subtypes involved in this action are unknown, expression and functions of these receptors were examined in DC. Western blot and flow cytometry analyses showed that all EPRs were coexpressed in DC. In a dose-dependent manner, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhanced EP(2)/EP(4) but not EP(1)/EP(3) expressions. NS-398, a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective inhibitor, suppressed LPS-enhanced EP(2)/EP(4) expression, suggesting that COX-2-issued prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) modulates DC function through stimulation of specific EPR subtypes. Using selective agonists, we found that , an EP(2) agonist, and PGE(1) alcohol, an EP(2) and EP(2)/EP(4) agonist, inhibited major histocompatibility complex class II expression and enhanced interleukin-10 production from DC. However, no effect was observed with sulprostone and 17-phenyl-omega-trinor-PGE(2), selective agonists for EP(1) and EP(1)/EP(3), respectively. Treatment of DC with dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), an analog of cAMP, mimics PGE(2)-induced, inhibitory effects. Taken together, our data demonstrate that EP(2)/EP(4) are efficient for mediating PGE(2)-induced modulation of DC functions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20959465>The prostaglandin E2 receptor, EP2, stimulates keratinocyte proliferation in mouse skin by G protein-dependent and {beta}-arrestin1-dependent signaling .</a></h2><p>The prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), EP2, plays important roles in mouse skin tumor development (Chun, K. S., Lao, H. C., Trempus, C. S., Okada, M., and Langenbach, . (2009) Carcinogenesis 30, 1620-1627). Because keratinocyte proliferation is essential for skin tumor development, EP2-mediated signaling  that contribute to keratinocyte proliferation were investigated. A single topical application of the EP2 agonist, , dose-dependently increased keratinocyte replication via activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and PKA signaling. Because GPCR-mediated activation of EGFR can involve the formation of a GPCR-β-arrestin-Src signaling complex, the possibility of a β-arrestin1-Src complex contributing to EP2-mediated signaling in keratinocytes was investigated.  induced β-arrestin1-Src complex formation and increased both Src and EGFR activation. A role for β-arrestin1 in EP2-mediated Src and EGFR activation was demonstrated by the observation that β-arrestin1 deficiency significantly reduced Src and EGFR activation. In agreement with a β-arrestin1-Src complex contributing to EGFR activation, Src and EGFR inhibition (PP2 and AG1478, respectively) indicated that Src was upstream of EGFR.  also induced the activation of Akt, ERK1/2, and STAT3, and both β-arrestin1 deficiency and EGFR inhibition (AG1478 or gefitinib) decreased their activation. In addition to β-arrestin1-dependent EGFR activation,  increased PKA activation, as measured by phospho-GSK3β (p-GSK3β) and p-cAMP-response element-binding protein formation. PKA inhibition (H89 or (P)-adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate ((P)-cAMPS)) decreased -induced cAMP-response element-binding protein and ERK activation but did not affect EGFR activation, whereas β-arrestin1 deficiency decreased EGFR activation but did not affect -induced PKA activation, thus indicating that they were independent EP2-mediated . Therefore, the results indicate that EP2 contributed to mouse keratinocyte proliferation by G protein-independent, β-arrestin1-dependent activation of EGFR and G protein-dependent activation of PKA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8078484>Cloning of a novel human prostaglandin receptor with characteristics of the pharmacologically defined EP2 subtype.</a></h2><p>A cDNA that when expressed has the binding and functional characteristics of the pharmacologically defined EP2 prostaglandin (PG) receptor [Cardiovasc. Drug Rev. 11:165-179 (1993)] has been cloned from a human placenta library. This clone, known as Hup-4, encodes a protein of 358 amino acids that has only approximately 30% overall identity with other PG receptors, including mouse and human clones that have been designated as EP2 receptors [J. Biol. Chem. 268:7759-7762 (1993); Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 197:263-270 (1993)]. In COS-7 cells transfected with Hup-4, PGE2 stimulated the formation of cAMP with an EC50 of approximately 50 nM. The EP2-selective agonists AH13205 and  were also active, with EC50 values in the range of 2-6 microM. The order of potency of PGs for competition with binding of [3H]PGE2 to membranes prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with Hup-4 was PGE2 > or = PGE1 > 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2 > or = 11-deoxy-PGE1 >  > AH13205 > 19()-OH-PGE2. Natural PGs and analogues that are selective for the FP (PGF2a), DP (PGD2), EP1 (sulprostone), EP3 (MB 28767), and EP4 (1-OH-PGE1) receptors were inactive or competed poorly with the binding of [3H]PGE2 (< 50% displacement of specific binding at 10 microM). Northern blot analysis showed the presence of a Hup-4 message of approximately 3.1 kilobases in mRNA from human lung and placenta. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction studies also indicated that Hup-4 is probably expressed in human uterus and in HL-60 (human promyelocytic leukemia) cells. Our findings suggest that Hup-4 encodes the pharmacologically defined EP2 receptor, whereas the mouse and human cDNAs previously classified as EP2 may represent another EP receptor subtype or the recently defined EP4 subtype [Prostaglandins 47:151-168 (1994)].</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20381634>Effects of prostaglandin E and F receptor agonists in vivo on luteal function in ewes.</a></h2><p>Loss of progesterone secretion at the end of the estrous cycle is via uterine PGF(2alpha) secretion; however, uterine PGF(2alpha) is not decreased during early pregnancy in ewes to prevent luteolysis. Instead the embryo imparts resistance to PGF(2alpha)-induced luteolysis, which is via the 2-fold increase in prostaglandins E(1) and E(2) (PGE(1), PGE(2); PGE) in the endometrium during early pregnancy. Chronic intrauterine infusion of PGE(1) or PGE(2) prevents spontaneous or an estradiol-17beta, IUD, or PGF(2alpha)-induced luteolysis. Four PGE receptor subtypes (EP(1), EP(2), EP(3), and EP(4)) and an FP receptor specific for PGF(2alpha) have been identified. The objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of EP(1), EP(2), EP(3), or FP receptor agonists in vivo on luteal mRNA for LH receptors, occupied and unoccupied LH receptors, and circulating progesterone in ewes. Ewes received a single treatment of 17-phenyl-tri-Nor-PGE(2) (EP(1), EP(3)),  (EP(2)), 19-()-OH-PGE(2) (EP(2)), sulprostone (EP(1), EP(3)), or PGF(2alpha) (FP) receptor agonists into the interstitial tissue of the ovarian vascular pedicle adjacent to the luteal-containing ovary. 17-Phenlyl-tri-Nor-PGE(2) had no effect (P> or =0.05) on any parameter analyzed.  and 19-()-OH-PGE(2) increased (P< or =0.05) mRNA for LH receptors, occupied and unoccupied LH receptors, and circulating progesterone. Both sulprostone and PGF(2alpha) decreased (P< or =0.05) mRNA for LH receptors, occupied and unoccupied LH receptors, and circulating progesterone. It is concluded that both EP(3) and FP receptors may be involved in luteolysis. In addition, EP(2) receptors may mediate prevention of luteolysis via regulation of luteal mRNA for LH receptors to prevent loss of occupied and unoccupied LH receptors and therefore to sustaining luteal function.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11557519>Prostanoids stimulate K secretion and Cl secretion in guinea pig distal colon via distinct .</a></h2><p>Short-circuit current (I(sc)) and transepithelial conductance (Gt) were measured in guinea pig distal colonic mucosa isolated from submucosa and underlying muscle layers. Indomethacin (2 microM) and NS-398 (2 microM) were added to suppress endogenous production of prostanoids. Serosal addition of PGE2 (10 nM) stimulated negative I(sc) consistent with K secretion, and concentrations >30 nM stimulated positive I(sc) consistent with Cl secretion. PGE2 also stimulated Gt at low and high concentrations. Dose responses to prostanoids specific for EP prostanoid receptors were consistent with stimulating K secretion through EP2 receptors, based on a rank order potency (from EC50 values) of PGE2 (1.9 nM) > 11-deoxy-PGE1 (8.3 nM) > 19()-hydroxy-PGE2 (13.9 nM) >  (67 nM) > 17-phenyl-trinor-PGE2 (307 nM) >> sulprostone (>10 microM). An isoprostane, 8-iso-PGE2, stimulated K secretion with an EC50 of 33 nM. Cl secretory response was stimulated by PGD2 and BW-245C, a DP prostanoid receptor-specific agonist: BW-245C (15 nM) > PGD2 (30 nM) > PGE2 (203 nM). Agonists specific for FP, IP, and TP prostanoid receptors were ineffective in stimulating I(sc) and Gt at concentrations <1 microM. These results indicate that PGE2 stimulated electrogenic K secretion through activation of EP2 receptors and electrogenic KCl secretion through activation of DP receptors. Thus stimulation of Cl secretion in vivo would occur either via physiological concentrations of PGD2 (<100 nM) or pathophysiological concentrations of PGE2 (>100 nM) that could occur during inflammatory conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24265450>EP2 receptor activates dual G protein signaling pathways that mediate contrasting proinflammatory and relaxatory responses in term pregnant human myometrium.</a></h2><p>Prostaglandin (PG) E2 (PGE(2)) plays a central role in the regulation of smooth muscle contractions. Classically, PGE(2) stimulates contractions via EP1 and EP3 receptors, whereas EP2 and EP4 maintain quiescence. Labor involves a change from myometrial quiescence to contractions with a shift from anti- to proinflammatory pathways. EP2, a Gαs-coupled receptor, is known to mediate its actions via cAMP signaling. However, we have recently shown that EP2 also activates the proinflammatory PG G/H synthase-2 (PGHS-2). Here, we identify the mechanism underlying the ability of EP2 to maintain uterine quiescence and activate a proinflammatory/prolabor response in term-pregnant human myometrium. Human myometrial biopsies for in vivo and in vitro studies were taken at cesarean section at term, before or after the onset of labor. Activation of EP2 increased intracellular levels of cAMP and reduced contractility. Contrastingly, EP2 stimulation increased levels of PGHS-2, membrane-associated PGE synthase-1, and PGE(2). This was entirely dependent on EP2-mediated activation of calcium signaling. Both calcium signaling and up-regulation of PGHS-2 were insensitive to the Gαi inhibitor pertussis toxin but inhibited by small interfering RNA knockdown of Gαq/11. There were no differences in EP2 mRNA or protein levels between upper or lower segment myometrium or between pre- and postlabor myometrium. However, in myocytes taken after the onset of labor, cAMP signaling was markedly attenuated, whereas activation of calcium and PGHS-2 was preserved. Overall, the dual coupling of EP2 to Gαs-cAMP and Gαq/11-calcium pathways underlies its ability to mediate contrasting functions in term pregnancy and the "switching" to a prolabor receptor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8910368>Regulation of expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in early human T cells of the HSB.2 cultured line by the EP3 subtype of prostaglandin E2 receptor.</a></h2><p>The expression by T lymphocytes (T cells) of more than one of the functionally distinct subtypes of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptors (Rs), designated EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 Rs, is a principal determinant of specificity and diversity of the immune effects of PGE2. The cultured line of human leukemic T cells, termed HSB.2, co-expresses a total of 7282 +/- 1805 EP3, EP4, and EP2 Rs per cell with a Kd of 3.7 +/- 1.4 nM (mean +/- S.E., n = 9). The EP3/EP1 -selective agonist sulprostone, EP3/EP2/EP4 -selective agonists M&B 28767 and misoprostol, and EP2 -selective agonist  but not the EP1 -selective antagonist SC-19220 competitively inhibited the binding of [3H]PGE2 to HSB.2 cells. Stimulation of increases in the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP ([cAMP]i) by PGE2, misoprostol, and  and of increases in the intracellular concentration of calcium ([Ca2+]i) by PGE2 and sulprostone demonstrated the respective involvement of EP2/EP4 Rs and EP3 Rs in transduction of biochemical signals. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 was identified by zymography and Western blots as the principal MMP secreted by HSB.2 cells. The cytosolic level and secretion of MMP-9 were increased maximally after 24 h of incubation of HSB.2 cells with 10(-8)-10(-6) M PGE2, sulprostone, M&B 28767, and misoprostol but not with 10(-6) M PGF2alpha, PGD2, PGI2, or , suggesting a principal dependence on EP3 Rs. That stimulation of MMP-9 secretion by PGE2 was not diminished in Ca2+-free medium but was suppressed significantly and dose-dependently by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of endomembrane Ca2+-ATPase, suggested that MMP-9 expression by HSB.2 cells is mediated by increases in [Ca2+]i attributable to release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. The lack of effect of dibutyryl cAMP, forskolin, and SQ 22536, an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, on MMP-9 secretion by HSB.2 cells argued against any role for cAMP-dependent mechanisms linked to EP2/EP4 Rs. Cycloheximide and actinomycin D, which respectively inhibited protein and RNA synthesis, suppressed basal and PGE2 induction of MMP-9 production by HSB.2 cells. Northern analysis indicated that PGE2 and sulprostone time-dependently increased expression of MMP-9 mRNA. Thus, stimulation of MMP-9 in HSB.2 T cells by PGE2 is attributable to [Ca2+]i-dependent EP3 -mediation of increases in message transcription.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20921530>A cyclooxygenase-2/prostaglandin E2 pathway augments activation-induced cytosine deaminase expression within replicating human B cells.</a></h2><p>Within inflammatory environments, B cells encountering foreign or self-Ag can develop tertiary lymphoid tissue expressing activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID). Recently, this DNA-modifying enzyme was detected in nonlymphoid cells within several inflamed tissues and strongly implicated in malignant transformation. This study examines whether a cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) pathway, often linked to inflammation, influences AID expression in activated B lymphocytes. In this paper, we report that dividing human B cells responding to surrogate C3d-coated Ag, IL-4, and BAFF express AID, as well as COX-2. A progressive increase in AID with each division was paralleled by a division-related increase in a COX-2-linked enzyme, microsomal PGE(2) synthase-1, and the PGE(2), EP2. Cells with the greatest expression of AID expressed the highest levels of EP2. Although COX-2 inhibitors diminished both AID expression and IgG class switching, exogenous PGE(2) and , a selective EP2 agonist, augmented AID mRNA/protein and increased the numbers of IgG(+) progeny. Despite the latter, the proportion of IgG(+) cells within viable progeny generally declined with PGE(2) supplementation. This was not due to PGE(2)-promoted differentiation to plasma cells or to greater downstream switching. Rather, because phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated levels were increased in progeny of PGE(2)-supplemented cultures, it appears more likely that PGE(2) facilitates AID-dependent DNA double-strand breaks that block B cell cycle progression or promote activation-induced cell death, or both. Taken together, the results suggest that a PGE(2) feed-forward mechanism for augmenting COX-2 pathway proteins promotes progressively increased levels of AID mRNA, protein, and function.</p></html>
