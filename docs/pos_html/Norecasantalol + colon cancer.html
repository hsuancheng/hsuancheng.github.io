In this study, we explored the mechanism of 5-FU resistance by bioinformatics analysis of the NCBI public dataset series GSE81005. Fifteen hub genes were screened out of 582 different expressed genes. Modules of the hub genes in protein-protein interaction networks gathered to TOP2 showed a decrease in HCT-8 cells but an increase in 5-FU-resistant HCT-8/5-FU cells with 5-FU exposure. Downregulation of TOP2 with siRNA or miR-494 transfection resulted in an increase of cytotoxicity and decrease of cell colonies to 5-FU for HCT-8/5-FU cells. Moreover, we found that an ethanol extract of Spica Prunellae (EESP), which is a traditional Chinese medicine with clinically beneficial effects in various cancers, was able to enhance the sensitivity of 5-FU in HCT-8/5-FU cells and partly reverse the 5-FU resistance effect. It significantly helped suppress cell growth and induced cell apoptosis in HCT-8/5-FU cells with the expression of TOP2 being significantly suppressed, which increased by 5-FU. Consistently, miR-494, which reportedly regulates TOP2, exhibited reverse trends in EESP/5-FU combination treatment. These results suggested that Spica Prunellae may be beneficial in the treatment of 5-FU-resistant CRC patients.Copyright © 2019 Yi Fang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626644>Genetically determined serum urate levels and cardiovascular and other diseases in UK Biobank cohort: A phenome-wide mendelian randomization study.</a></h2><p>The role of urate in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) has been extensively investigated in observational studies; however, the extent of any causal effect remains unclear, making it difficult to evaluate its clinical relevance.A phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) together with a Bayesian analysis of tree-structured phenotypic model (TreeWAS) was performed to examine disease outcomes related to genetically determined serum urate levels in 339,256 unrelated White British individuals (54% female) in the UK Biobank who were aged 40-69 years (mean age, 56.87; SD, 7.99) when recruited from 2006 to 2010. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to replicate significant findings using various genome-wide association study (GWAS) consortia data. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine possible pleiotropic effects on metabolic traits of the genetic variants used as instruments for urate. PheWAS analysis, examining the association with 1,431 disease outcomes, identified 13 distinct phecodes representing 4 disease groups (inflammatory polyarthropathies, hypertensive disease, circulatory disease, and metabolic disorders) and 9 disease outcomes (gout, gouty arthropathy, pyogenic arthritis, essential hypertension, coronary atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, chronic ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, and hypercholesterolemia) that were associated with genetically determined serum urate levels after multiple testing correction (p < 3.35 × 10-4). TreeWAS analysis, examining 10,750 ICD-10 diagnostic terms, identified more sub-phenotypes of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (e.g., angina pectoris, heart failure, cerebral infarction). MR analysis successfully replicated the association with gout, hypertension, heart diseases, and blood lipid levels but indicated the existence of genetic pleiotropy. Sensitivity analyses support an inference that pleiotropic effects of genetic variants on urate and metabolic traits contribute to the observational associations with CVDs. The main limitations of this study relate to possible bias from pleiotropic effects of the considered genetic variants and possible misclassification of cases for mild disease that did not require hospitalization.In this study, high serum urate levels were found to be associated with increased risk of different types of cardiac events. The finding of genetic pleiotropy indicates the existence of common upstream pathological elements influencing both urate and metabolic traits, and this may suggest new opportunities and challenges for developing drugs targeting a common mediator that would be beneficial for both the treatment of gout and the prevention of cardiovascular comorbidities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650063>The prediction incidence of the three most common cancers among Iranian military community during 2007-2019: a time series analysis.</a></h2><p>Cancers are one of the most important public health problems in Iran.

A lot of investigations have confirmed the involvement of CCAT2 in the tumorigenesis of many  types. Previous studies found that over-expression of CCAT2 significantly promoted cell migration and proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis of HCC cells. In the present investigation, the clinical value and prognostic significance of CCAT2 were investigated.The 122 pairs of HCC tissues and adjacent normal liver tissues were acquired between September 2013 and February 2018. The expression levels of CCAT2 in HCC tissues and their corresponding adjacent normal liver tissues were examined by RT-qPCR analysis. Survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed using the log-rank test. Independent prognostic indicators were determined in the multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazard model.CCAT2 expression levels were significantly increased in HCC tissues compared to that in their normal counterparts (P < .001). CCAT2 expression was significantly correlated with vascular invasion (P = .001), histopathologic grading (P = .001), distant metastasis (P = .002) and TNM stage (P = .018). A Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that the overall survival rate of HCC patients in high CCAT2 expression group markedly decreased as compared with that of low CCAT2 expression group (P = .016). In addition, COX multivariate analysis showed that high expression of CCAT2 was an independent risk factor for predicting shorter overall survival time in HCC (HR = 2.126, 95%CI:1.273-8.775, P = .021).Taken together, this research revealed that lncRNA CCAT2 may serve as a potential biomarker for predicting overall survival time in HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637417>Transanal ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis has comparable long-term functional outcomes to transabdominal approach: a multicentre comparative study.</a></h2><p>The transanal approach to ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (Ta-IPAA) provides better access to the lower pelvis with lower short-term morbidity in ulcerative colitis (UC). The aim of this study was to assess the long-term functional outcomes after Ta-IPAA versus transabdominal IPAA (Abd-IPAA) in UC.A multicentre cohort analysis was done between March 2002 and September 2017. Patient characteristics, surgical details and postoperative outcomes were compared. CGQL (Cleveland global quality of life) score at 12 months with a functioning pouch was considered the primary endpoint.A total of 374 patients (100 Ta-IPAA vs 274 Abd-IPAA) were included. Ta-IPAA demonstrated a comparable overall quality of life (CGQL score) to Abd-IPAA (0.75 ± 0.11 vs 0.71 ± 0.14; respectively, p=0.1). Quality of life (7.71 ± 1.17 vs 7.30 ± 1.46; p=0.04) and energy level items (7.16 ± 1.52 vs 6.66 ± 1.68; p=0.03) were significantly better after Ta-IPAA, while the quality of health item was comparable (7.68 ± 1.26 vs 7.64 ± 1.44; p=0.96). Analysis excluding anastomotic leaks did not change the overall CGQL scores. Stool frequencies (>10/ 24 hrs:22% vs 21%; p=1.0) and the rate of single episode of major incontinence during the 12-month period (27% vs 26%; p=0.89) were similar. The differences in thirty-day morbidity rates (33% vs 41%; p=0.2) and the anastomotic leak rates were not significant (6% vs 13%; p=0.09).This study provides evidence of comparable long-term functional outcome and quality of life after Ta-IPAA and Abd-IPAA for UC.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

Adiponectin is an adipose tissue-derived adipokine, whose levels are reduced during obesity. Both epidemiological and preclinical data indicate that adiponectin suppresses  tumorigenesis. We have previously demonstrated that both adiponectin and AdipoRon, a small-molecule adiponectin receptor agonist, suppress  risk in part by reducing the number of Lgr5 stem cells in mouse  organoids. However, the mechanism by which the adiponectin signaling pathway attenuates  risk remains to be addressed. Here, we have hypothesized that adiponectin signaling supports  stem cell maintenance through modulation of the biophysical properties of the plasma membrane (PM). Specifically, we investigated the effects of adiponectin receptor activation by AdipoRon on the biophysical perturbations linked to the attenuation of Wnt-driven signaling and cell proliferation as determined by LEF luciferase reporter assay and  organoid proliferation, respectively. Using physicochemical sensitive dyes, Di-4-ANEPPDHQ and C-laurdan, we demonstrated that AdipoRon decreased the rigidity of the  cell PM. The decrease in membrane rigidity was associated with a reduction in PM free cholesterol levels and the intracellular accumulation of free cholesterol in lysosomes. These results suggest that adiponectin signaling plays a role in modulating cellular cholesterol homeostasis, PM biophysical properties, and Wnt-driven signaling. These findings are noteworthy because they may in part explain how obesity drives  progression.Copyright © 2019 Biophysical Society. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have been identified which are associated with CRP levels, and Mendelian randomization studies have shown a positive association between SNPs increasing CRP expression and risk of  (but thus far not CVD). The effects of individual genetic variants often interact with the genetic background of a population and hence we sought to resolve the genetic determinants of serum CRP in a number of American Indian populations.The Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS) has serum CRP measurements from 2428 tribal members, recruited as large families from three regions of the United States. Microsatellite markers and MetaboChip defined SNP genotypes were incorporated into variance components, decomposition-based linkage and association analyses.CRP levels exhibited significant heritability (h2 = 0.33 ± 0.05, p<1.3 X 10-20). A locus on chromosome (chr) 6, near marker D6S281 (approximately at 169.6 Mb, GRCh38/hg38) showed suggestive linkage (LOD = 1.9) to CRP levels. No individual SNPs were found associated with CRP levels after Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing (threshold <7.77 x 10-7), however, we found nominal associations, many of which replicate previous findings at the CRP, HNF1A and 7 other loci. In addition, we report association of 46 SNPs located at 7 novel loci on chromosomes 2, 5, 6(2 loci), 9, 10 and 17, with an average of 15.3 Kb between SNPs and all with p-values less than 7.2 X 10-4.In agreement with evidence from other populations, these data show CRP serum levels are under considerable genetic influence; and include loci, such as near CRP and other genes, that replicate results from other ethnic groups. These findings also suggest possible novel loci on chr 6 and other chromosomes that warrant further investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645679>Identification of genes of four malignant tumors and a novel prediction model development based on PPI data and support vector machines.</a></h2><p>Triple-negative breast  (TNBC),  adenocarcinoma (COAD), ovarian  (OV), and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are common malignant tumors, in which significant challenges are still faced in early diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Therefore, further identification of genes related to those malignant tumors is of great significance for the improvement of management of the diseases. The database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository was used as the data source of gene expression profiles in this study. Malignant tumors genes were selected using a feature selection algorithm of maximal relevance and minimal redundancy (mRMR) and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. And finally selected 20 genes as potential related genes. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis were performed on the potential related genes, and different tumor-specific genes and similarities and differences between network modules and pathways were analyzed. Further, using the potential -related genes found above in this study as features, a support vector machine (SVM) model was developed to predict high-risk malignant tumors. As a result, the prediction accuracy reached more than 85%, indicating that such a model can effectively predict the four types of malignant tumors. It is demonstrated that such genes found above in this study indeed play important roles in the differentiation of the four types of malignant tumors, providing basis for future experimental biological validation and shedding some light on the understanding of new molecular mechanisms related to the four types of tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617868>Association of Psoriasis With the Risk of Developing or Dying of : A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>The risk of  developing in people with psoriasis has raised some concern, with little clarity regarding differentiation in risk according to psoriasis severity.To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies on the risk of  incidence and mortality in people with psoriasis.Six electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, MEDLINE in Process, Cochrane Central Register, Web of Science, and LILACS [Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde]) were searched from inception to November 15, 2017, for eligible studies.Cohort and case-control studies that provided estimates of the risk of  incidence or  mortality associated with psoriasis were included.Data were extracted relating to study design, study population, and risk estimates. Study-specific estimates of the relative risk (RR) were combined using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I2 statistic. Data were analyzed from April 9, 2018, through February 22, 2019.Pooled RR estimates for  incidence and  mortality for psoriasis cohorts compared with people without psoriasis.A total of 58 unique studies were included, with quality varying for the incidence and the mortality studies.

Overall  mortality risk was higher in patients with severe psoriasis (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.08-1.38 [4 studies]). Specifically, liver (RR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.09-1.88]), esophageal (RR, 2.53 [95% CI, 1.87-3.41]), and pancreatic (RR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.02-1.69])  mortality were found to be elevated in those with severe psoriasis. The heterogeneity of estimates was often very high despite stratification. Marked attenuation of risk was found in those studies that adjusted estimates for smoking, alcohol consumption, and obesity.In this study, people with psoriasis appeared to have an increased risk of  incidence and -related mortality involving a range of site-specific cancers.

Patients were stratified into two groups: early-onset CC (< 50 years old) and late-onset CC (≥ 50 years old). Outcome measures were hospital length of stay, 30-day complications, mortality, and readmission.We included a total of 15,957 patients in the analysis. Mean age was 65 ± 13 years, and 52% were male. Overall 10% of the patients had early-onset CC. Patients with early-onset CC were more likely to be black (11% vs 7%, p = 0.04) and Hispanic (8% vs 4%, p = 0.02). Additionally, they presented with a more aggressive tumor and higher TNM staging. Patients with early onset CC had lower 30-day complications (18% vs 22%, p = 0.02), shorter hospital length of stay (6[3-8] vs 8[5-11], p = 0.03) and lower 30-day mortality (0.4% vs 1.8%, p = 0.04) compared to their counterparts. However, there was no difference between the two groups regarding 30-day readmission. On regression analysis, there was no difference between the two groups regarding study outcomes.Racial disparity does exist in the incidence of  in the young with higher incidence in blacks. Younger patients with CC tend to have better surgical outcomes on univariate analysis.

The reduced form of metabolic cofactor NAD(P)H is one of the major intrinsic fluorescent components in tissues and a valuable indicator of cellular metabolic activity. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) enables resolution of both the free and protein-bound fractions of this cofactor, and thus, high sensitivity detection of relative changes in the NAD(P)H-dependent metabolic pathways in real time. However, the clinical use of this technique is still very limited. The applications of metabolic FLIM could be usefully expanded by probing cellular metabolism in tissues ex vivo. For this, however, the development of appropriate tissue preservation protocols is required in order to maintain the optical metabolic characteristics in the ex vivo sample in a state similar to those of the tumor in vivo. Using mouse tumor models of different histological types - colorectal , lung carcinoma and melanoma - we tested eight different methods of tissue handling by comparing NAD(P)H fluorescence decay parameters ex vivo and in vivo as measured with two-photon excited FLIM microscopy. It was found that the samples placed in 10% BSA on ice immediately after excision maintained the same fluorescence lifetimes and free/bound ratios as measured in vivo for at least 3 hours. This protocol was subsequently used for metabolic assessments in fresh postoperative samples from colorectal  patients. A high degree of inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity with a trend to a more oxidative metabolism was detected in T3 colorectal tumors in comparison with normal tumor-distant  samples. These results suggest that the methodology developed on the basis of FLIM of NAD(P)H in tissues ex vivo show promise for interrogating the metabolic state of patients' tumors.© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663904>Novel Circulating Tumor Cell Assay for Detection of Colorectal Adenomas and .</a></h2><p>There is a significant unmet need for a blood test with adequate sensitivity to detect colorectal  (CRC) and adenomas. We describe a novel circulating tumor cell (CTC) platform to capture colorectal epithelial cells associated with CRC and adenomas.Blood was collected from 667 Taiwanese adults from 2012 to 2018 before a colonoscopy. The study population included healthy control subjects, patients with adenomas, and those with stage I-IV CRC. CTCs were isolated from the blood using the CellMax platform. The isolated cells were enumerated, and an algorithm was used to determine the likelihood of detecting adenoma or CRC. Nominal and ordinal logistic regression demonstrated that CTC counts could identify adenomas and CRC, including CRC stage.The CellMax test demonstrated a significant association between CTC counts and worsening disease status (Cuzick's P value < 0.0001) with respect to the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. The test showed high specificity (86%) and sensitivity across all CRC stages (95%) and adenomatous lesions (79%). The area under the curve was 0.940 and 0.868 for the detection of CRC and adenomas, respectively.The blood-based CTC platform demonstrated high sensitivity in detecting adenomas and CRC, as well as reasonable specificity in an enriched symptomatic patient population.If these results are reproduced in an average risk population, this test has the potential to prevent CRC by improving patient compliance and detecting precancerous adenomas, eventually reducing CRC mortality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644410>Mechanism of a Novel Camptothecin-Deoxycholic Acid Derivate Induced Apoptosis Against Human Liver  HepG2 Cells and Human  HCT116 Cells.</a></h2><p>Camptothecin (CPT) hasis been known as an anticancer drug in traditional Chinese medicine.

Moreover, G2-treatment led to S and G2/M phase arrest in both cells, which could be elucidated by the change of mRNA levels of p21, p27 and Cyclin E and the increased protein level of p21. G2 also induced dramatically ROS accumulated and MMP decreased, which contributed to the apoptosis through activation of both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways via changing the genes and proteins expression involved in apoptosis pathway in both of HepG2 and HCT116 cells. <p> Conclusion: These findings suggested that the apoptotis in both cell lines induced by G2 in both cell lines was related to both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655290>A novel fluorescent marking clip for laparoscopic surgery of colorectal : A case report.</a></h2><p>In laparoscopic surgery, marking of tumor location has been gaining importance. Tattoo marking has been often used but the technique carries the risk of accidental peritoneal scattering or other organ injury. We have been involved in the development of a novel fluorescent clip for marking tumor sites and supposed that its usage would reduce risks related to other marking methods.A 52-year-old man was diagnosed with sigmoid  and polyp, and was scheduled for laparoscopic sigmoidectomy. On the day before operation, fluorescent clips (ZEOCLIP FS: Zeon Medical co, Ltd, Tokyo) were endoscopically placed around the tumor and polyp sites, 4 clips for each lesion attached every 90 degrees within the  lumen, respectively. During the operation, locations of the fluorescent clips were easily confirmed using a full-color fluorescent laparoscope, VISION SENSE (Medtronic Co., U.S.). Curative operation was performed accordingly with the preoperative pathological and radiological findings. The postoperative course was uneventful.Locations of intraluminally placed fluorescent clips were clearly and easily recognized through the serosal layer of the intestinal wall using a fluorescent laparoscope. Complications related to dye scattering or intestinal wall/other organ perforation were not observed suggesting that future incorporation of this tumor site marking technique into laparoscopic surgery might be beneficial.The fluorescent marking clips were easily placed and recognized with a fluorescent laparoscope. This method is expected to be safe and risks of accidental puncture related to tattoo marking method can be reduced or almost eliminated.Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640851>Curative intent resection for loco-regionally recurrent : Cleveland clinic experience.</a></h2><p>Locoregional  recurrence occurs in around 10% of patients following initial curative intent primary resection.

These cells have a high rate of glutaminolysis and release ammonia (NH) as a byproduct, which may function as a diffusible signal among  cells and can reveal cellular heterogeneity. E7, a nematic liquid crystal (LC), is doped with 4-pentyl-4'-biphenyl carboxylic acid (PBA) and encapsulated in polymeric microcapsules (P-E7), which are then immobilized on cells in a microfluidic channel. Normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and myeloma, human primary glioblastoma (U87), human  carcinoma (Caco-2), and human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cells are investigated for the release of NH. The P-E7 is able to visualize NH release from the cell via a radial-to-bipolar (R-B) orientation change, observed through a polarized optical microscope. The various cell lines significantly differ in their response time required for an R-B change. The mean response times for Caco-2, U87, and MCF-7 cells are 277, 155, and 121 s, respectively. NH release from a single cell captured in a microwell flow chip shows a similar R-B change.

Bacterial 16S V3-V4 and fungal ITS V3-V4 ribosomal RNA genes of stool samples were sequenced. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GS/MS) was performed to detect the microbial metabolites in stool samples. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to compare distinct gut microorganisms and microbial metabolites between rectal and sigmoid cancers.The prognosis in CRC with different sites is significantly different. The closer to the anus predicted longer survival time. The difference between genes and co-expression pairs in CRC with different sites were constructed. The relative abundance of 112 mRNAs and 26 lncRNAs correlated with the sites of CRC were listed. Nine differentially expressed genes at different sites of CRC were correlated with prognosis. A drug-gene interaction network contained 227 drug-gene pairs were built. The relative abundance of gut bacteria and gut fungus, and the content of microbe-related metabolites were statistically different between rectal and sigmoid cancers.There are many differences in prognosis, genome, drug targets, gut microbiome, and microbial metabolome in different colorectal  sites. These findings may improve our understanding of the role of the CRC sites in personalized and precision medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648389>Establishment and characterization of a novel neuroendocrine carcinoma cell line derived from a human ascending  tumor.</a></h2><p>The incidence of rare neuroendocrine tumors (NET) is rapidly increasing. Neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is a NET with poorly differentiated histological features, high proliferative properties and associated poor prognoses. Since these carcinomas are so rare, and thus, affect only a small number of patients allowing for few cell lines to be derived from patient biopsies, the histological, immunohistochemical, and clinical characteristics associated with colorectal NEC and NECs in other organs, have yet to be clearly defined. Herein, we describe the establishment of a novel NEC cell line (SS-2) derived from a tumor resection of the ascending  from a 59-year-old Japanese woman. The histological, electron microscopic and immunohistochemical features of chromogranin A (CgA) as well as the confirmation of synaptophysin positivity in this tumor were typical of those commonly observed in surgically resected colorectal NECs. Further, the Ki-67 labeling index of the resected tumor was > 20 %, and thus, the tumor was diagnosed as an NEC of the ascending . The SS-2 cell line maintained characteristic features to those of the resected tumor, which were further retained following implantation into the subcutaneous tissues of nude mice. Additionally, when SS-2 cells were seeded into ultra-low attachment plates they formed spheres that expressed higher levels of the  stem cell (CSC) marker CD133 compared to SS-2 cells cultured under adherent conditions. SS-2 cells may, therefore, contribute to the current knowledge on midgut NEC biological behaviors, while providing a novel platform for examining the effects of colorectal NEC drugs, including CSC.© 2019 The Authors.

DNA methylation could control lncRNA expression and play an important role in tumor initiation and progression. However, the DNA methylation that regulates lncRNAs in CRC remains poorly characterized.  In our research, we integrated dysregulated expression and methylation of lncRNAs between colorectal tumor and adjacent mucosa tissues from The  Genome Atlas database. With the use of this strategy, LINC00460, the most frequently epigenetically activated, was identified and further verified in the  Cell Line Encyclopedia and Gene Expression Omnibus databases.  Patients with high expression of LINC00460 are prone to metastasis and are associated with poor prognosis. Abnormally expressed LINC00460 could be used as an independent prognostic risk factor for disease-free survival. Knockdown of LINC00460 promotes  cell invasion and migration .  In summary, our results suggest that DNA methylation-regulated LINC00460 could promote CRC metastasis and serve as a potential therapeutic target for CRC.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Lu, Wu and Feng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663444>Berberine and  exert a potential anticancer effect on  cells by acting on specific pathways.</a></h2><p>Berberine (BBR) is a natural active principle with potential antitumor activity. The compound targets multiple cell signaling pathways, including proliferation, differentiation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms behind the anticancer activity of BBR by comparing the effects of purified BBR with those of the extract of , a medicinal plant that produces this metabolite. The expression levels of a panel of 44 selected genes in human  adenocarcinoma (HCA-7) cell line were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). BBR treatment resulted in a time- and dose-dependent down regulation of 33 genes differently involved in cell cycle, differentiation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The trend was confirmed across the two types of treatment, the two time points, and the different absolute dosage of BBR. These findings suggest that the presence of BBR in  extract significantly contributes to its antiproliferative activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642313>A Near-Complete Series of Four Atropisomeric Jozimine A-Type Naphthylisoquinoline Dimers with Antiplasmodial and Cytotoxic Activities and Related Alkaloids from .</a></h2><p>Three new naphthylisoquinoline dimers, jozibrevines A-C (-), were isolated from the West African shrub , along with the known dimer jozimine A (). The two molecular moieties of - are coupled via the sterically constrained 3',3″-positions of their two naphthalene units, so that the central biaryl linkage is rotationally hindered. With the two outer axes also being chiral, - possess three consecutive stereogenic axes. The four isolated dimers all have the same constitutions and identical absolute configurations at the four stereogenic centers, but differ by their axial chirality. They belong to the extremely small class of Dioncophyllaceae-type naphthylisoquinoline dimers, i.e., being devoid of oxygen functions at C-6 and bearing the -configuration at C-3 in their isoquinoline portions. Besides these dimers, the plant produces predominantly typical Ancistrocladaceae-type monomeric compounds, i.e., with the -configuration at C-3 and an oxygen function at C-6, such as the new ancistrobrevines K () and L (). Furthermore, a new hybrid-type (i.e., mixed Ancistrocladaceae/Dioncophyllaceae-type) alkaloid was identified, named ancistrobrevine M (), which is 3-configured and 6-oxygenated. Remarkable was the discovery of its "inverse hybrid-type" counterpart, dioncoline A (). It is the as yet only known 3-configured naphthylisoquinoline lacking an -functionality at C-6. The new jozibrevines A-C (-) exhibited pronounced antiplasmodial activities in the submicromolar range, with  being the most potent compound (IC, 0.012 μM). Furthermore, jozimine A () showed cytotoxicity against human  carcinoma (HT-29), fibrosarcoma (HT1080), and multiple myeloma (MM.1S)  cells, displaying IC values of 12.0, 9.0, and 5.0 μM, respectively, whereas jozibrevines A () and B () were nontoxic in this concentration range.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641961>Integrin-EGFR interaction regulates anoikis resistance in  cells.</a></h2><p>Anoikis resistance is an essential property of  cells that allow the extra-cellular matrix-detached cells to survive in a suspended state in body fluid in order to metastasize and invade to distant organs. It is known that integrins play an important role in anoikis resistance, but detailed mechanisms are not well understood. Here we report that highly metastatic  cells showed a higher degree of anoikis resistance than the normal intestinal epithelial cells. These anoikis-resistant  cells express high-levels of integrin-α2, β1, and activated EGFR in the anchorage-independent state than the anchorage-dependent state. In contrast, normal intestinal epithelial cells failed to elevate these proteins. Interestingly, a higher co-association of EGFR with integrin-α2β1/-α5β1 was observed on the surface of anoikis-resistant cells. Thus, in the absence of extra-cellular matrix, integrins in association with EGFR activates downstream effectors ERK and AKT and suppress Caspase-3 activation to induce anoikis resistance as was confirmed from the gene-ablation and pharmacological inhibitor studies. Interestingly, these anoikis-resistant  cells express high-level of  stem cell signatures (CD24, CD44, CD133, EpCAM) and pluripotent stem cell markers (OCT-4, SOX-2, Nanog) as well as drug-resistant pumps (ABCG2, MDR1, MRP1). Altogether, our findings unravel the interplay between integrin-α2β1/-α5β1 and EGFR in anoikis resistance and suggest that the resistant cells are  initiating or  stem cells, which may serve as a promising target to combat metastasis of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646798>Prognostic importance of tumor location and anti-EGFR therapy in patients with K-RAS wild type metastatic colorectal .</a></h2><p>To compare anti-EGFR and anti-VEGF agents in patients with K-RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal  (mCRC) with regards to tumor location.450 patients diagnosed with mCRC, who applied to our center were included in this retrospective study.

Bark and Their In Vitro Antioxidant and Cytotoxic Potential.</a></h2><p>Plants have been the basis of traditional medicine since the dawn of civilizations. Different plant parts possess various phytochemicals, playing important roles in preventing and curing diseases. Scientists, through extensive experimental studies, are playing an important part in establishing the use of phytochemicals in medicine. However, there are still a large number of medicinal plants which need to be studied for their phytochemical profile. In this study, the objective was to isolate phytochemicals from bark of  L. and to study them for their antioxidant and cytotoxic activities. The bark was extracted with methanol, followed by column chromatography and thus isolating kaempferol, stigmasterol, protocatechuic acid-methyl ester (PCA-ME) and protocatechuic acid (PCA). 2,2-azinobis-3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) and 2, 2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) radical scavenging assays were utilized for assessment of antioxidant activity, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye reduction assay was used to determine cytotoxic activity against C-6 glioma rat brain, MCF-7 breast , and HCT-15  cell lines. The compounds were found to have significant antioxidant and cytotoxic activity.

However, completing the full-cycle of oxaliplatin is often associated with severe neurotoxicity. To spare patients from the toxic effects, without comprising the required efficacy, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of a modified XELOX (mXELOX) adjuvant chemotherapy regimen with 6 cycles of oxaliplatin and a full cycle of capecitabine.We retrospectively analyzed 330 eligible patients with stage III  who underwent curative tumor resection followed by mXELOX, standard XELOX or unfinished XELOX adjuvant chemotherapy between December 2007 and April 2015. Associated prognostic factors were investigated and their disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were also determined and compared among the different regimen groups.Compared with the standard XELOX group, the mXELOX group had lower total incidence rates of neurotoxicity (39.3% vs. 76.2%, P < 0.001), leucopenia (53.6% vs. 69.8%, P = 0.017) and thrombocytopenia (38.1% vs. 56.3%, P = 0.011).

The heterogeneity and genomic instability of  tumors make current treatments unsatisfactory. This study evaluated a novel nanoscale delivery platform comprising phosphonated calixarenes (P4C6) co-loaded with paclitaxel (PTX) and carboplatin (CPT). The nanoparticles showed average hydrodynamic sizes of 84 ± 8 nm for empty P4C6 nanoparticle and 119 ± 13 nm for PTX-CPT-P4C6. The corresponding zeta potentials were -40.8 ± 8.8 and -35.4 ± 4.2 mV. The optimal CPT:PTX ratio was 5.22:1, and PTX-CPT-P4C6 with this ratio was more cytotoxic against HT-29 cells than against Caco-2 cells (IC, 0.4 ± 0.02 vs. 2.1 ± 0.3 μM), and it induced higher apoptosis in HT-29 cells (56.6 ± 4.5 vs. 44.9 ± 3.44%).

Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a master regulator of many cytoprotective genes, plays a protective role in carcinogenesis. Recent studies have identified a specific gene-expression signature regulated by the Nrf2 pathway in lung adenocarcinoma and head-and-neck squamous cell . However, the roles of Nrf2 in the development of colitis-associated colorectal  (CACC) have not been well characterized. Nrf2 target genes as prognostic biomarkers in CACC remain to be explored. Thus, this work aimed to identify the molecular changes that occur during mouse CACC progression to facilitate the development of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.The CACC model was established using azoxymethane (AOM) with dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) in BALB/c mice for 3 weeks to induce colitis-associated adenoma (CAA, early stage) and for 9 weeks to induce colitis-associated carcinoma (CAC, late stage). Using RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics analyses we examined the mRNA expression profiles of 6 groups: wild-type control (WT-C), WT-CAA, WT-CAC, Nrf2 knockout control (Nrf2KO-C), Nrf2KO-CAA, and Nrf2KO-CAC.In the AOM/DSS model of colitis-associated tumorigenesis, Nrf2 mice showed a phenotype similar to WT mice, but with significantly more tumors and a much higher percentage of adenocarcinomas. We identified 47 novel Nrf2 genes via gene expression profiling of tumor samples. Survival analysis showed that 23 of these genes were biomarkers of a poor prognosis in  patients.Nrf2 target genes deserve exploration as prognostic and therapeutic targets for CRC.Copyright © 2019.

No loss of lumen/blind advancement was necessary in any of the procedures. No adverse events occurred. Among the completed colonoscopies, 6/34 (17.6%) patients had adenomas, all proximal to the site of prior failure, including one advanced adenoma.

However, the metabolite-sensing G-protein-coupled receptors that regulate  ILC3s remain poorly understood. We found that  ILC3s expressed Ffar2, a microbial metabolite-sensing receptor, and that Ffar2 agonism promoted ILC3 expansion and function. Deficiency of Ffar2 in ILC3s decreased their in situ proliferation and ILC3-derived interleukin-22 (IL-22) production. This led to impaired gut epithelial function characterized by altered mucus-associated proteins and antimicrobial peptides and increased susceptibility to  injury and bacterial infection. Ffar2 increased IL-22 CCR6 ILC3s and influenced ILC3 abundance in  lymphoid tissues. Ffar2 agonism differentially activated AKT or ERK signaling and increased ILC3-derived IL-22 via an AKT and STAT3 axis.

Cosmc dysfunction leads to inactive T-synthase and results in aberrant O-glycosylation, which is associated with various tumour malignancies. However, it is unclear whether Cosmc has some other functions beyond its involvement in O-glycosylation. In this study, we aimed to investigate the functional role of Cosmc in human colorectal  (CRC). We first assessed the expression levels of Cosmc in human CRC specimens and then forcedly expressed Cosmc in human CRC cell lines (HCT116, SW480) to examine its impact on cellular behaviours. The mechanisms for aberrant expression of Cosmc in CRC tissues and the altered behaviours of tumour cells were explored. It showed that the mRNA and protein levels of Cosmc were markedly elevated in human CRC specimens relative to normal colorectal tissues. The occurrence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress may largely contribute to the increased Cosmc expression in  tissue and cells. Cosmc overexpression in CRC cells significantly promoted cell migration and invasion, which could be attributed to the activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway rather than aberrant O-glycosylation. These data indicate that Cosmc expression was elevated in human CRC possibly caused by ER stress, which further enhanced malignancies through the activation of EMT but independently of aberrant O-glycosylation.© 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, we examined the structure-activity relationships of isoflavones and isomeric flavone and flavanones as AhR ligands on the basis of their induction of CYP1A1, CYP1B1, and UGT1A1 gene expression in  Caco2 cells and young adult mouse colonocyte (YAMC) cells. Caco2 cells were significantly more Ah-responsive than YAMC cells, and this was due, in part, to flavonoid-induced cytotoxicity in the latter cell lines. The structure-activity relationships for the flavonoids were complex and both response and cell context specific; however, there was significant variability in the AhR activities of the isomeric substituted isoflavones and flavones. For example, 4',5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone (genistein) was AhR-inactive whereas 4',5,7-trihydroxyflavone (apigenin) induced CYP1A1, CYP1B1, and UGT1A1 in Caco2 cells. In contrast, both 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methoxy substituted isoflavone (biochanin A) and flavone (acacetin) induced all three AhR-responsive genes; 4',5,7-trimethoxyisoflavone was a potent AhR agonist, and the isomeric flavone was AhR-inactive. These results coupled with simulation studies modeling flavonoid interaction within the AhR binding pocket demonstrate that the orientation of the substituted phenyl ring at C-2 (flavones) or C-3 (isoflavones) on the common 4--chromen-4-one ring strongly influences the activities of isoflavones and flavones as AhR agonists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624724>15-Deoxy-Δ-prostaglandin J Upregulates the Expression of 15-Hydroxyprostaglandin Dehydrogenase by Inducing AP-1 Activation and Heme Oxygenase-1 Expression in Human  Cells.</a></h2><p>Abnormal upregulation of prostaglandin E (PGE) is considered to be a key oncogenic event in the development and progression of inflammation-associated human . It has been reported that 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), an enzyme catabolizing PGE, is ubiquitously downregulated in human . 15-Deoxy-Δ-prostaglandin J (15d-PGJ), a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ ligand, has been shown to have anticarcinogenic activities. In this study, we investigate the effect of 15d-PGJ on expression of 15-PGDH in human  HCT116 cells.HCT116 cells were treated with 15d-PGJ analysis. The expression of 15-PGDH in the treated cells was measured by Western blot analysis and RT-PCR. In addition, the cells were subjected to a 15-PGDH activity assay. To determine which transcription factor(s) and signaling pathway(s) are involved in 15d-PGJ-induced 15-PGDH expression, we performed a cDNA microarray analysis of 15d-PGJ-treated cells. The DNA binding activity of AP-1 was measured by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. To determine whether the AP-1 plays an important role in the 15d-PGJ-induced 15-PGDH expression, the cells were transfected with siRNA of c-Jun, a major subunit of AP-1. To elucidate the upstream signaling pathways involved in AP-1 activation by 15d-PGJ, we examined its effect on phosphorylation of Akt by Western blot analysis in the presence or absence of kinase inhibitor.15d-PGJ (10 μM) significantly upregulated 15-PGDH expression at the mRNA and protein levels in HCT-116 cells. 15-PGDH activity was also elevated by 15d-PGJ. We observed that genes encoding C/EBP delta, FOS-like antigen 1, c-Jun, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were most highly induced in the HCT116 cells following 15d-PGJ treatment. 15d-PGJ increased the DNA binding activity of AP-1. Moreover, transfection with specific siRNA against c-Jun significantly reduced 15-PGDH expression induced by 15d-PGJ. 15d-PGJ activates Akt and a pharmacological inhibitor of Akt, LY294002, abrogated 15d-PGJ-induced 15-PGDH expression. We also observed that an inhibitor of HO-1, zinc protoporphyrin IX, also abrogated upregulation of 15-PGDH and down-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 expression induced by 15d-PGJ.These finding suggest that 15d-PGJ upregulates the expression of 15-PGDH through AP-1 activation in  HCT116 cells.Copyright © 2019 Korean Society of  Prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643740>Floxuridine.</a></h2><p>Floxuridine (FUDR) is a pyrimidine analogue used as an antineoplastic agent, usually as a continuous hepatic arterial infusion to treat hepatic metastases from .

However, these associations are poorly defined, leaving practitioners conflicted on management of these patients.To perform a comprehensive review to clarify the strength of these relationships and identify which patients may benefit from additional screening and/or genetic screening.A literature search was performed using the PubMed, Ovid, and Cochrane databases. Syndromic, familial, and sporadic cases of multiple pilomatricomas were stratified based on number of pilomatricomas. This information was graphed for visual comparison.Sixty-six syndromic cases from 52 publications were identified, with the majority (54) of cases representing myotonic dystrophy, familial adenomatous polyposis-related syndromes (including Gardner syndrome), Turner syndrome, or Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Twenty-five of the 54 cases (46.3%) had six or more pilomatricomas. Of sporadic cases, 128 out of 134 (95.5%) had five or less pilomatricomas.Most articles were case reports and series, which are vulnerable to publication bias. Specific details were not explicitly noted in some original articles, and incomplete data could not always be included in analysis. Syndromes may have been missed in sporadic cases.The presence of six or more pilomatricomas is highly suggestive of an underlying syndrome (>95% specificity).

Herein, we evaluated the effect of miR-298 dysregulation on  invasiveness. First, metabolic activity, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and invasion of miR-298 overexpressed/knocked out  cells were examined and combined with their transcriptome analysis data for better visualization of miR-298 intracellular signaling networks. Interaction between miR-298 and its target was evaluated with luciferase assay and validated using western blot analysis. The proportion of abnormal miR-298 level was investigated in tumor samples, matched normal adjacent tissues, and plasmas of 100 CRC patients, and also compared with 100 normal plasma samples. The Mann-Whitney U test was performed to assess miR-298 differences among the studied groups, and the correlation between miR-298 and the risk of CRC was shown by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. The data indicate that miR-298 overexpression promoted proliferation and metastasis in CRC cells via targeting phosphatase and tensin homolog. Comparative analysis of CRC tumors, normal adjacent tissues, and plasmas indicated a significant miR-298 upregulation in tumors and plasmas (1.72-fold and 1.65-fold, respectively; p < .001). Also, the aberrant level of miR-298 contributed with CRC tumor differentiation, TNM stage and lymph node metastasis (p < .001), and independently associated with poor survival of CRC patients (p < .029; hazard ratio: 1.292; 95% confidence interval: 0.339-2.184). Collectively, these data showed that abnormal level of miR-298 correlated with  development and through that lowered the overall survival rate of CRC patients.

Ral regulates tumorigenesis and invasion/metastasis of some cancers; however, the role of Ral in colitis-associated  (CAC) has not been investigated. We aimed to elucidate the role of Ral in the mechanism of CAC.We used wild-type (WT) mice and RalGAPα2 knockout (KO) mice that exhibited Ral activation, and bone marrow chimeric mice were generated as follows; WT to WT, WT to RalGAPα2 KO, RalGAPα2 KO to WT, and RalGAPα2 KO to RalGAPα2 KO mice. CAC was induced in these mice by intraperitoneal injection of azoxymethane followed by dextran sulfate sodium intake. Intestinal epithelial cells were isolated from  tissues, and we performed cDNA microarray analysis. Cytokine expression in normal  tissues and CAC was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.Bone marrow chimeric mice showed that immune cell function between WT mice and RalGAPα2 KO mice was not significantly different in CAC mechanism. RalGAPα2 KO mice had a significantly larger tumor number and size and a significantly higher proportion of tumors invading the submucosa than WT mice. Higher expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and MMP-13 were observed in RalGAPα2 KO mice than in WT mice. The expression levels of IL-1β, NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1 were apparently elevated in the tumors of RalGAPα2 KO mice compared to WT mice.

Therefore, developing anticancer agents which can selectively target the  cells and cause less side effects are the main objectives of the new therapeutic strategies for treatment advanced or metastatic cancers. Newcastle disease virus strains AF2240 and V4-UPM were shown to be cytolytic against various  cells in-vitro and very effective as antileukemicagents.45 rats at 6 weeks of age, were randomly assigned to nine groups with 5 rats in each group, both azoxymethane (AOM) and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) were given to rats according to the body weight.

CD44CD133 high-expressing and other populations of human DLD-1  cells were separately isolated through fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The sphere-forming activity of each population and the anti-sphere-forming effects of FTD and fluorouracil (5-FU) on CD44CD133 cells were then measured. CD44CD133 DLD-1 cells formed substantially more spheres than other cells. Moreover, treating CD44CD133 DLD-1 cells with subtoxic concentrations of FTD (1 µM) inhibited sphere formation, and this was superior to the effect of subtoxic concentrations (1 µM) of 5-FU. The associated inhibition rates for FTD and 5-FU were 58.2% and 26.1%, respectively. Further, CD44CD133 DLD-1 cells expressed higher levels of thymidine kinase 1, which is responsible for FTD phosphorylation, than DLD-1 cells, and FTD was incorporated into the DNA of CD44CD133 DLD-1 cells. Thus, our data show that FTD treatment is effective against CSC-like cells and might be applied as CSC-targeting chemotherapy for tumor subtypes with high CD44 and CD133 expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648589>PHBV/PLGA nanoparticles for enhanced delivery of 5-Fluorouracil as promising treatment of .</a></h2><p>5-FU is one of the most widely used agents in the first-line chemotherapy for .

Cellular O-GlcNAcylation levels are regulated by a unique couple of enzymes: O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), which adds and removes the GlcNAc residue, respectively. Maintenance of O-GlcNAc homeostasis is essential to ensure optimal cellular function and disruption of this homeostasis has been linked to the etiology of several human diseases including . The mechanisms through which the cell maintains O-GlcNAc homeostasis are not fully understood but several studies have suggested that a reciprocal regulation of OGT and OGA expression could be one of them. In this study, we investigated the putative regulation of OGT and OGA expression in response to disruption in O-GlcNAc homeostasis in . We provide in vitro and in vivo evidences that in  cells, modulation of O-GlcNAcylation levels leads to a compensatory regulation of OGT and OGA expression in an attempt to restore basal O-GlcNAcylation levels. Our results also suggests that the regulation of  OGA expression in response to changes in O-GlcNAc homeostasis occurs mostly at the transcriptional level whereas OGT regulation seems to rely mainly on post-transcriptional mechanisms.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Five methods (mean treatment difference averaged over time, using a mixed-effects growth curve model; mixed-effects models for repeated measurements (MMRM); time-to-deterioration (TTD); status change; and responder analysis) were used to analyze EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status (GHS)/QoL and scores from functional scales.Overall, GHS/QoL and physical functioning deteriorated over time. Mean treatment difference slightly favored nintedanib over placebo for physical functioning (adjusted mean, 2.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-4.34) and social functioning (adjusted mean, 2.62; 95% CI, 0.66-4.47). GHS/QoL was numerically better with nintedanib versus placebo (adjusted mean, 1.61; 95% CI, -0.004 to 3.27). MMRM analysis had similar results, with better physical functioning in the nintedanib group at all timepoints. There was no significant delay in GHS/QoL deterioration (10%) and physical functioning (16%) with nintedanib versus placebo (TTD analysis). Status change analysis showed a higher proportion of patients with markedly improved GHS/QoL and physical functioning in the nintedanib versus placebo groups.

In this study, we assess the effect of hyperglycemia on  cell aggressiveness in human  epithelial adenocarcinoma cells  and in an experimental animal model of CRC. Our results show that Nox (NADPH oxidase enzyme) 4-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is deregulated in both diabetes and CRC. This is paralleled by inactivation of the AMPK and activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) C1 signaling pathways, resulting in 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) accumulation, induction of DNA damage, and exacerbation of  cell aggressiveness, thus contributing to the genomic instability and predisposition to increased tumorigenesis in the diabetic milieu. Pharmacologic activation of AMPK, inhibition of mTORC1, or blockade of Nox4 reduce ROS production, restore the homeostatic signaling of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase/8-oxodG, and lessen the progression of CRC malignancy in a diabetic milieu.

In colons of mice, organoids that expressed BRAF and fusions in R-spondin genes formed flat serrated lesions. Patient-derived TSA organoids grew independent of exogenous R-spondin, and 1 line grew independent of Noggin. Organoids that overexpressed GREM1, in addition to BRAF and fusions in R-spondin genes, formed polypoid tumors in mice that had similar histologic features to TSAs.

A random-effects model was applied to calculate the pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs).Seven studies consisting of 1,162,971 participants with schizophrenia were included in this meta-analysis. Data regarding mortality risk of breast, , lung and prostate  among schizophrenia patients were subjected to quantitative analysis. Pooled results showed significant increases in mortality risk of breast  (RR = 1.97, 95%CI 1.38-2.83), lung  (RR = 1.93, 95%CI 1.46-2.54) and  (RR = 1.69, 95%CI 1.60-1.80) in patients with schizophrenia compared with those in the general population or control group. The mortality risk of prostate  increased in male patients, although no significant difference was detected (RR = 1.58, 95% CI 0.79-3.15). Increased risks of mortality from lung and  were observed in female patients (RR = 2.49, 95%CI 2.40-2.59 and RR = 2.42, 95%CI 1.39-4.22, respectively) and elevated risks of mortality from lung and  in male patients (RR = 2.40, 95%CI 2.30-2.50 and RR = 1.90, 95%CI 1.71-2.11, respectively) were detected.Individuals with schizophrenia have a significantly high risk of mortality from breast, , and lung .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637474>Combining alpha radiation-based brachytherapy with immunomodulators promotes complete tumor regression in mice via tumor-specific long-term immune response.</a></h2><p>Diffusing alpha-emitters radiation therapy (DaRT) is the only known method for treating solid tumors with highly destructive alpha radiation. More importantly, as a monotherapy, DaRT has been shown to induce a systemic antitumor immune response following tumor ablation. Here, immunomodulatory strategies to boost the antitumor immune response induced by DaRT, and the response specificity, were investigated in the  CT26 mouse model. Local treatment prior to DaRT, with the TLR3 agonist poly I:C, was sufficient to inhibit tumor growth relative to poly I:C or DaRT alone. DaRT used in combination with the TLR9 agonist CpG, or with the TLR1/2 agonist XS15 retarded tumor growth and increased tumor-rejection rates, compared to DaRT alone, curing 41% and 20% of the mice, respectively. DaRT in combination with CpG, the Treg inhibitor cyclophosphamide, and the MDSC inhibitor sildenafil, cured 51% of the animals, compared to only 6% and 0% cure when immunomodulation or DaRT was used alone, respectively. Challenge and Winn assays revealed that these high cure rates involved a specific immunological memory against CT26 antigens. We suggest that DaRT acts in synergy with immunomodulation to induce a specific and systemic antitumor immune response. This strategy may serve as a safe and efficient method not only for tumor ablation, but also for in situ vaccination of  patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622737>Risk Factors Associated With Early-onset Colorectal .</a></h2><p>The incidence of colorectal  (CRC) is increasing in individuals younger than 50 years, who do not usually undergo screening if they are of average risk. We sought to identify risk factors for CRC in this population.We compared sociodemographic and medical characteristics of patients who received a diagnosis of CRC at an age of 18-49 years (early-onset) with patients who received a diagnosis of CRC at an age of 50 years or older (late-onset) and with age-matched, -free individuals (controls) at a tertiary academic hospital. We collected data from all adult patients with a diagnosis of CRC from January 1, 2011 through April 3, 2017 from electronic health records. Associations with risk factors were assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression models.We identified 269 patients with early-onset CRC, 2802 with late-onset CRC, and 1122 controls. Compared with controls, patients with early-onset CRC were more likely to be male (odds ratio [OR], 1.87; 95% CI, 1.39-2.51), have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (3% vs 0.4% for controls; univariable P<.01), and have a family history of CRC (OR, 8.61; CI, 4.83-15.75). Prevalence values of well-established modifiable CRC risk factors, including obesity, smoking, and diabetes, were similar. Compared to patients with late-onset CRC, patients with early-onset CRC were more likely to be male (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.11-1.87), black (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.08-2.65) or Asian (OR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.57-4.15), and have IBD (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.16-6.63) or a family history of CRC (OR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.89-4.25). Sensitivity analyses excluding IBD and family history of CRC showed comparable results. Early-onset CRC was more likely than late-onset disease to be detected in the left  or rectum (75% vs 59%, P=.02) and at a late stage of tumor development (77% vs 62%, P=.01).In a retrospective study of patients with early-onset CRC vs late-onset CRC or no , we identified non-modifiable risk factors, including sex, race, IBD, and family history of CRC, to be associated with early-onset CRC.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

The contribution of 1O2 and ˙OH to DNA degradation was proved using gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, the pronounced generation of ROS by mouse  carcinoma cells (CT26) stimulated by both copper(ii) complexes was confirmed. A fluorescence method allowed the total amounts of ROS generated inside the CT26 cells to be detected, while the spin trapping technique proved that free radicals mainly attached to the membrane surface. These last results are in agreement with the data obtained from the ICP-MS method, which demonstrates that 1Cu and 2Cu complexes are not efficiently accumulated inside the cell. Furthermore, the role of ROS in lipid peroxidation was established. The above-mentioned factors may clearly indicate the contribution of ROS generated by the studied copper(ii) complexes to  cell damage, which can lead to a carcinogenesis process.

The analysis was performed for progression-free survival and overall survival according to the sidedness and other known prognostic factors.Out of 53 patients treated with triplet therapy, 11 had right sided and 42 had left-sided primaries. The median age for right-sided primaries was 46 (range 24-55) compared to 53 (range 32-74) in left-sided primaries. Median progression-free survival was 14 months for right vs 18 months for left sided tumors (Hazard ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.27-1.88, p=0.492) and median overall survival was 21 months for right vs 29 months for left sided tumors (Hazard ratio was 0.86, 95% CI 0.32-2.26, p=0.752).First-line triplet chemotherapy may overcome the difference in prognosis between right sided and left sided primaries in metastatic colorectal .

This study investigated the effects of using an ethanol extract of Chrysanthemum zawadskii Herbich (ECZ) to induce apoptosis and autophagy associated with reliable signal pathways in mouse  CT-26 cells.Using ECZ on mouse  CT-26 cells, cell viability, annexin V/propidium iodide staining, acridine orange staining, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and western blotting were assayed.ECZ exhibited cytotoxicity in CT-26 cells in a dose-dependent manner. ECZ induced apoptosis was confirmed by caspase-3 activation, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, it was shown that ECZ induced autophagy via the increased conversion of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3II, the degradation of p62, and the formation of acidic vesicular organelles. The inhibition of ROS production by N-Acetyl-L-cysteine resulted in reduced ECZ-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Furthermore, the inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine resulted in enhanced ECZ-induced apoptosis via increased ROS generation.These findings confirmed that ECZ induced ROS-mediated autophagy and apoptosis in  cells.

A cohort study was conducted including  patients in Denmark diagnosed between 2005 and 2016 with rectum, malignant melanoma, breast, testis, oesophageal, , cervix, prostate, stomach, pancreatic, lung and ovary  (n = 256,663). Distance to each patient's GP and to the hospital of diagnosis were calculated using ArcGIS, Network Analyst. The results showed that for most easy-to-diagnose  types (rectum , malignant melanoma, testis ) and cervix , increasing travel distance to the hospital of diagnosis increased the odds of advanced disease at diagnosis. Contrary, increasing travel distance to the hospital was associated with decreased odds of being diagnosed with advanced disease stage among hard-to-diagnose  types (stomach, pancreatic, lung and ovarian ), and prostate .

We investigated the mechanisms by which the western diet promotes tumor recurrence, including changes in the microbiome, in mice that underwent colorectal resections.BALB/c male mice were fed either standard chow diet or western-type diet (characterized by high fat, no fiber, and decreased minerals and vitamins) for 4 weeks; some mice were given antibiotics or ABA-PEG20k-Pi20 (Pi-PEG), which inhibits collagenase production by bacteria but not bacterial growth, in drinking water. Colorectal resections and anastomoses were then performed. The first day after surgery, mice were given enemas containing collagenolytic rodent-derived strain of Enterococcus faecalis (strain E2), and the second day they were given mouse  carcinoma cells (CT26). Twenty-one days later, distal colons were removed and  contents (feces, distal , and tumor) were collected.  tissues were analyzed by histology, for the presence of collagenolytic colonies, and by 16S rRNA sequencing. determined the anatomical distribution of E faecalis at the site of the anastomosis and within tumors using in situ hybridization. Mouse imaging analyses were used to identify metastases.Colorectal tumors were found in 88% of mice fed the western diet and given antibiotics, surgery, and E faecalis compared with only 30% of mice fed the standard diet followed by the same procedures.  tumor formation correlated with the presence of collagenolytic E faecalis and Proteus mirabilis. Antibiotics eliminated collagenolytic E faecalis and P mirabilis but did not reduce tumor formation. However, antibiotics promoted emergence of Candida parapsilosis, a collagenase-producing microorganism. Administration of a Pi-PEG reduced tumor formation and maintained diversity of the  microbiome.We identified a mechanisms by which diet and antibiotic use can promote tumorigenesis by  cells at the anastomosis following colorectal surgery. Strategies to prevent emergence of these microbe communities or their enzymatic activities might be used to reduce the risk of tumor recurrence in patients undergoing colorectal  surgery.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

The biological functions of miR-552 have been well documented in ; however, the role of miR-552 in HCC remains unclear. The present study evaluated the effects of miR-552 in HCC physiology, using HCC cell lines as model. An miR-552 inhibitor was transfected into HCC cell lines to knock down the expression of miR-552. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analysis were used to detect the expression of miR-552 and Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3), respectively. MTT assay was used to analyze cell viability, whilst Transwell and wound-healing assay were used to investigate cell migration. Flow cytometry was performed to measure cell apoptosis. The direct association between RUNX3 and miR-552 was evaluated using dual luciferase reporter assay. The expression of miR-552 was significantly elevated in HCC tumor tissues compared with the adjacent healthy samples. Additionally, transfection with the miR-552 inhibitor decreased cell viability and migration. miR-552 knockdown also increased HCC cell apoptosis . In conclusion, these results suggest that miR-552 has an oncogenic function in HCC and is a potential biomarker for detecting HCC.Copyright: © Ma et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655804>Increase in Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 Levels without Tumor Progression after Polaprezinc Administration that Induced Deep Vein Thrombosis in a  Patient.</a></h2><p>Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) is a well-known tumor marker of adenocarcinoma (reference range, 37 U/mL).

However, the therapeutic outcome of conventional methodologies relying on only one mechanism is rather limited. Herein, the first example of ultrasmall responsively aggregatable nanochelators that can intrinsically fulfill both antivasculature functions as well as high renal clearable efficiency is introduced. The nanochelators with sub-6 nm sizes exhibit not only systemic copper depletion activity for tumor antiangiogenesis but also, more surprisingly, the capability to transform from a "dispersed" state to an "aggregated" state to form large secondary particles in response to tumor microenvironment with elevated copper and phosphate levels for blood vessel obstruction. Compared to a benchmark antiangiogenic agent that can only inhibit the formation of tumor blood vessels, the nanochelators with unprecedented synergistic functions demonstrate significantly enhanced tumor inhibition activity in both breast  and  tumor models. Moreover, these ultrasmall nanochelators are noncytotoxic and renal clearable, ensuring superior biocompatibility. It is envisaged that the design of nanomaterials with ground-breaking properties and the synergistic antivasculature functions would offer a substantial conceptual advance for tumor vasculature targeted therapy and may provide vast opportunities for developing advanced nanomedicines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627712>Bispecific anti-OX40/CTLA-4 antibodies for advanced solid tumors: a patent evaluation of WO2018202649.</a></h2><p>: OX40 is a potent costimulatory receptor of the immune response in various types of  and has been used as a target for the generation of agonists of its function.

Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is an indicator of overall body metabolism and may be a proxy for the impact of a specific metabolic profile on  risk. Therefore, we investigated the association of estimated BMR with incidence of 13 obesity-related cancers in the European Prospective Investigation into  and Nutrition. Estimated BMR at baseline was calculated using the WHO/FAO/UNU equations and the relationships between BMR and  risk were investigated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. A total of 141,295 men and 317,613 women, with a mean follow-up of 14 years were included in the analysis. Overall, higher BMR was associated with a greater risk for most cancers that have been linked with obesity. However, among normal weight participants, higher BMR was associated with elevated risks of esophageal adenocarcinoma (Hazard Ratio per 1-standard deviation change in BMR [HR ]: 2.46; 95%CI 1.20; 5.03), and distal  (HR : 1.33; 95%CI 1.001; 1.77) among men, and with proximal  (HR : 1.16; 95%CI 1.01; 1.35), pancreatic (HR : 1.37; 95%CI 1.13; 1.66), thyroid (HR : 1.65; 95%CI 1.33; 2.05), postmenopausal breast (HR : 1.17; 95%CI 1.11; 1.22), and endometrial (HR : 1.20; 95%CI 1.03; 1.40) cancers in women. These results indicate that higher BMR may be an indicator of a metabolic phenotype associated with risk of certain  types, and may be a useful predictor of  risk independent of body fatness.

In light of previous studies, we explored the therapeutic potential of IRF8 inhibition as immunomodulatory therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To this end, we utilized siRNA-loaded lipid-based nanoparticles (siLNPs) and demonstrated a ∼90% reduction of IRF8 mRNA levels in vitro (PV < 0.0001), alongside a notable reduction in IRF8 protein. Moreover, silencing IRF8 ex vivo in splenocytes lead to a profound downregulation of IRF8 protein, followed by an immunomodulatory effect, as represented by a decrease in the secretion of TNFα, IL6 and IL12/IL23 (IL12p40) proinflammatory cytokines (PV = 0.0045, 0.0330, <0.0001, respectively). In order to silence IRF8 in vivo, selectively in inflammatory leukocytes, we used siLNPs that were coated with anti-Ly6C antibodies via our recently published ASSET targeting approach. Through this strategy, we have demonstrated a selective binding of the targeted-LNPs (T-LNPs) to Ly6C + inflammatory leukocytes. Finally, an immunomodulatory effect was demonstrated in vivo in an IBD mouse model with a profound decrease of TNFα, IL6, IL12/IL23, and IL1β pro-inflammatory cytokines (n = 5, PV < 0.0001, <0.0001, <0.0001, 0.02, respectively) and an improvement of -morphology as assessed by -length measurements and colonoscopy (PV < 0.0001). Overall, using antibody-targeted siLNPs, we showed a notable reduction of IRF8 mRNA and protein and demonstrated a targeted immunomodulation therapeutic effect ex vivo and in vivo, in the DSS colitis model. We claim that a selective silencing of IRF8 in inflammatory leukocytes (such as Ly6C+) may serve as a therapeutic approach for treating inflammatory disorders.Copyright © 2019.

A comprehensive immune and gene expression analysis was performed in the periphery and/or tumor microenvironment (TME) of MC38-CEA tumor-bearing mice.Although N-803 plus vaccine induced peripheral CD8 T cell activation and cytokine production, there was no reduction in tumor burden and poor tumor infiltration of CD8 T cells with minimal levels of granzyme B. For the first time, we demonstrate that the addition of entinostat to N-803 plus vaccine promoted significant tumor control, correlating with increased expression of genes associated with tumor inflammation, enhanced infiltration of activated CD8 T cells with maximal granzyme B, T-cell responses to multiple tumor-associated antigens, increased serum IFNg, reduction of regulatory T cells in the TME, and decreased expression of the checkpoint V-domain Ig Suppressor of T cell Activation (VISTA) on multiple immune subsets.Collectively, these data demonstrate that the synergistic combination of entinostat, N-803, and vaccine elicits potent anti-tumor activity by generating a more inflamed TME.

We used multiplexed mass spectrometry to collect high-content information on protein phosphorylation in two different mouse models of IBD. Because the biological function of the vast majority of phosphorylation sites remains unknown, we developed Substrate-based Kinase Activity Inference (SKAI), a methodology to infer kinase activity from phosphoproteomic data. This approach draws upon prior knowledge of kinase-substrate interactions to construct custom lists of kinases and their respective substrate sites, termed kinase-substrate sets that employ prior knowledge across organisms. This expansion as much as triples the amount of prior knowledge available. We then used these sets within the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis framework to infer kinase activity based on increased or decreased phosphorylation of its substrates in a dataset. When applied to the phosphoproteomic datasets from the two mouse models, SKAI predicted largely non-overlapping kinase activation profiles. These results suggest that chronic inflammation may arise through activation of largely divergent signaling networks. However, the one kinase inferred to be activated in both mouse models was mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2 or MK2), a serine/threonine kinase that functions downstream of p38 stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase. Treatment of mice with active colitis with ATI450, an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of the MK2 pathway, reduced inflammatory signaling in the  and alleviated the clinical and histological features of inflammation. These studies establish MK2 as a therapeutic target in IBD and identify ATI450 as a potential therapy for the disease.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

We evaluated the costs and benefits of testing for Lynch syndrome and determined the optimal surveillance interval for first-degree relatives (FDRs) found to have Lynch syndrome.We developed a patient flow diagram to determine costs and yield of immunohistochemical testing for Lynch syndrome in CRC cases and, for those found to have Lynch syndrome, their FDRs, accounting for realistic uptake. Subsequently, we used the MISCAN- model to compare costs and benefits of annual, biennial, and triennial surveillance in FDRs identified with Lynch syndrome vs colonoscopy screening every 10 years (usual care for individuals without a diagnosis of Lynch syndrome).Testing 1000 CRC cases was estimated to identify 20 CRC index cases and 29 FDRs with Lynch syndrome at a cost of $310,274. Despite the high cost of Lynch syndrome tests, offering the FDRs with Lynch syndrome biennial colonoscopy surveillance was cost effective at $8785 per life-year gained compared with usual care, due to a substantial increase in life-years gained (+122%) and cost savings in CRC care. Triennial surveillance was more costly and less effective, and annual surveillance showed limited additional benefit compared with biennial surveillance.Immunohistochemical testing for Lynch syndrome in persons younger than 70 years who received a diagnosis of colorectal , and then testing first-degree relatives of those found to have Lynch syndrome, provides a good balance between costs and long-term benefits. Colonoscopy surveillance every 2 years is the optimal surveillance interval for patients with Lynch syndrome.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Mutations in the exon 6 of the PPM1D result in production of a highly stable, C-terminally truncated PPM1D. These gain-of-function PPM1D mutations are present in various human cancers but their role in tumorigenesis remains unresolved. Here we show that truncated PPM1D impairs activation of the cell cycle checkpoints in human non-transformed RPE cells and allows proliferation in the presence of DNA damage. Next, we developed a mouse model by introducing a truncating mutation in the PPM1D locus and tested contribution of the oncogenic PPM1D allele to  tumorigenesis. We found that p53 pathway was suppressed in  stem cells harboring PPM1D resulting in proliferation advantage under genotoxic stress condition. In addition, truncated PPM1D promoted tumor growth in the  in Apc mice and diminished survival. Moreover, tumor organoids derived from  of the ApcPpm1d mice were less sensitive to 5-fluorouracil when compared to ApcPpm1dand the sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil was restored by inhibition of PPM1D. Finally, we screened colorectal  patients and identified recurrent somatic PPM1D mutations in a fraction of  adenocarcinomas that are p53 proficient and show defects in mismatch DNA repair. In summary, we provide the first in vivo evidence that truncated PPM1D can promote tumor growth and modulate sensitivity to chemotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646072>Autoinducer-2 of gut microbiota, a potential novel marker for human colorectal , is associated with the activation of TNFSF9 signaling in macrophages.</a></h2><p>: The interaction between the quorum sensing (QS) molecules of gut microbiota and the immunity of colorectal  (CRC) has not been investigated before. : We measured the concentration of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) in samples of stool, colorectal tissue, saliva and serum of CRC patients, and compared this to AI-2 levels in colorectal adenoma (AD) and normal  mucosa (NC). To explore the activated signaling pathways involved, we utilized AI-2 extracted from  to stimulate macrophages and validated these  findings in human CRC tissues. : The AI-2 concentration in both colorectal tissue and stool of CRC patients was significantly higher when compared to that in AD and NC (all  values < .01). The AI-2 concentration along with the progression of CRC in both tissues and stools was significantly increased (= .045，= .0003, respectively). After AI-2 stimulation, TNFSF9 was the most significantly increased protein in macrophage cells ( < .01). TNFSF9 expression was significantly higher in CRC tissues when compared to NCs (< .0001), which was mainly derived from macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, AI-2 level was positively associated with CD3 + T cell numbers (= .0462), and negatively associated with CD4/CD8 ratio (= .0113) within CRC tissues. : We demonstrated for the first time that AI-2 may serve as a novel marker for screening CRC in the clinic.

Meanwhile, we performed a rescue experiment by treating cells with the ERK pathway activator LM22B-10 prior to treatment of cells with 5.1% sevoflurane。 KEY FINDINGS: High concentration (5.1%) of sevoflurane significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of cells, causing G0/G1 phase arrest and promoted apoptosis and autophagy. 5.1% sevoflurane can participate in the regulation of EMT by regulating the expression of E-cadherin, Vimentin and N-cadherin proteins. LM22B-10 promoted proliferation and invasion of  cells and inhibited apoptosis and autophagy, while 5.1% sevoflurane could reverse the effect of LM22B-10 on the biological characteristics of cells. Sevoflurane can significantly inhibit tumor growth in SW480 cells transplanted nude mice. Moreover, 5.1% sevoflurane significantly increased the expression of p-Raf, p-MEK1/2, and p-ERK1/2 in SW480 cells and tumor tissues without affecting p-JNK and p-p38 proteins, meanwhile, 5.1% sevoflurane can inhibit the activation of ERK signaling pathway by LM22B-10 in vitro and in vivo.Sevoflurane can inhibit the proliferation and invasion of  cells, induce apoptosis and autophagy, and participate in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which may be related to its inhibition of the ERK signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019.

This study aimed to present the clinicopathologic features of GNET, including treatment information. We included 19 patients with GNET with a mean tumor size of 4.2 cm. The most common site of tumor origin was the small intestine (57.9%), followed by the stomach (15.8%),  (10.5%), ileocecal junction (5.3%), lower esophagus (5.3%), and anal canal (5.3%). Microscopically, the tumors were composed of epithelioid cells with eosinophilic or clear cytoplasm arranged in nest, sheet-like, papillary, or pseudoalveolar patterns and/or spindle tumor cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in a fascicular pattern. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells stained positively for S100 (19/19,100%), SOX10 (14/15, 93.3%), vimentin (17/17, 100%), synaptophysin (Syn) (7/17, 41.2%), CD56 (4/13, 30.8%), CD99 (1/5, 20%), and CD117 (1/15, 6.7%), and negatively for HMB45, Melan A, DOG1, CD34, AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, chromogranin A, smooth muscle actin, and desmin. In total, 14/15 (93.3%) cases showed split Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 gene (EWSR1) signals consistent with a chromosomal translocation involving EWSR1. Within a mean follow-up of 29.7 months (range: 3 to 63 mo), 2/15 (13.3%) patients died of disease, 5 (33.3%) were alive with disease, and 8 (53.3%) had no evidence of disease. Two and 1 patients showed partial response to apatinib and anlotinib, respectively. In conclusion, GNET has distinctive morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic features and should be distinguished from other gastrointestinal tract malignancies. Apatinib and anlotinib might be effective for the treatment of advanced GNET and could prolong patient survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621980>miR-4709 overexpression facilitates  proliferation and invasion via downregulating NR3C2 and is an unfavorable prognosis factor in  adenocarcinoma.</a></h2><p>To date, microRNA-4709 (miR-4709) has not been studied in  adenocarcinoma (COAD) on the basis of experiments. In our study, we aimed to investigate the biological roles and clinical significance of miR-4709 in COAD. The expression difference between miR-4709 and NR3C2 was measured based on The  Genome Atlas database and cells. Kaplan-Meier and logrank tests were applied to determine the overall survival (OS) differences according to the miR-4709 and NR3C2 expression levels. To measure whether the miR-4709 level was associated with COAD cell growth, migration, and invasion, we respectively conducted 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, wound healing, and transwell assays. A luciferase reporter assay was applied to confirm the relationship between miR-4709 and its predicted target. High expression of miR-4709 was found in COAD tissues and cells. The OS rate in the miR-4709 low expression group was significantly higher than that in the miR-4709 high expression group. Univariate and multivariate analyses exhibited that miR-4709 expression was an independent adverse prognostic factor. Exogenous miR-4709 overexpression promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion of LOVO and SW480 cells. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase assay demonstrated that miR-4709 directly binds to the 3'-untranslated region of NR3C2. NR3C2 was lowly expressed in COAD and high expression of NR3C2 had a better prognosis compared with that in the low expression of NR3C2. Correlation analysis showed that there is a close association between the level of expression of NR3C2 and miR-4709. Accordingly, miR-4709 may function as an oncogene in COAD and provide a preclinical proof for candidate management to target new miR-4709-NR3C2 signaling for COAD therapy.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623013>Laparoscopic "first inferior mesenteric vein (IMV)" approach for a splenic flexure tumor - video vignette.</a></h2><p>A tumor located in the distal third of the transverse , or in the left  angle, or in the proximal descending  within 10 cm from the flexure may be defined as splenic flexure (SF)  .The oncological goal for all resectable  tumors is wide excision with associated lymphadenectomy.

There is an extensive interest in the potential role of the GM in different diseases including , diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and aging. The GM changes over the lifespan and is strongly associated with various age-related diseases. Ames dwarf (df/df) mice are characterized by an extended life- and healthspan, and although these mice are protected from many age-related diseases, their microbiome has not been studied. To determine the role of microbiota on longevity animal models, we investigated the changes in the GM of df/df and Normal control (N) mice, by comparing parents before mating and littermate mice at three distinct time points during early life. Furthermore, we studied the effects of a 6-month calorie restriction (CR), the most powerful intervention extending the lifespan. Our data revealed significant changes of the GM composition during early life development, and we detected differences in the abundance of some bacteria between df/df and N mice, already in early life. Overall, the variability of the microbiota by genotype, time-point and breeding pair showed significant differences. In addition, CR caused significant changes in microbiome according to gastrointestinal (GI) location (distal , ileum and cecum), genotype and diet. However, the overall impact of the genotype was more prominent than that of the CR. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the gut microbiota plays an important role during post-natal development in long-living df/df mice and CR dietary regimen can significantly modulate the GM.© The Author(s) 2019.

On enhanced barium enema study, the cecum was in the pelvis, and the ascending  was running medially in the abdomen. Enhanced CT scan of the abdomen revealed rotation of the superior mesenteric vein(SMV). We diagnosed the case as sigmoid (cT3N0M0, StageⅡA)with non rotation-type intestinal malrotation, and performed laparoscopic surgery. We confirmed the small intestine to be located on the right side of the abdomen, the cecum to be located in the pelvis, and the ascending  to be running medially in the abdomen. The ascending mesocolon was adherent to the right of the sigmoid mesocolon. Following dissections of the ascending mesocolon from the sigmoid mesocolon, we performed surgery via the inside approach as usual. We dissected the root of the inferior mesenteric artery(IMA), and the operation was completed. In laparoscopic surgery for colorectal  with intestinal malrotation, there are some reports that it could be performed safely if attention is paid to adhesion of the mesenteries and vascular variation in the course of preoperative imaging diagnosis.

We aimed to assess how prolonged frozen storage and freeze-thaw cycles might affect measures of faecal haemoglobin (Hb) and diagnostic performance of FITs. Methods From 2005 through 2010, participants of screening colonoscopy (n = 2042) and clinical colorectal  (CRC) cases (n = 184) provided faecal samples in stool containers (60 mL). The samples were stored at -80 °C for up to 11 years and underwent three freeze-thaw cycles. Between each cycle, a defined amount of faeces was extracted using the manufacturer's sampling device of one or two FITs (RIDASCREEN, OC-Sensor). Faecal Hb concentration and diagnostic performance were calculated and compared across freeze-thaw cycles. Results For RIDASCREEN and the OC-Sensor, repeat measurements were available for 504 and 551 study participants, respectively. Hb concentrations correlated strongly (0.77 and 0.85, respectively) and diagnostic performance indicators were similar at the repeat measurements among the same FITs. For RIDASCREEN we found even slightly higher Hb levels, sensitivities and area under the curves (AUCs) after the third than after the first freeze-thaw cycle. For the OC-Sensor the Hb levels, sensitivities and AUCs were slightly lower after prolonged storage and one additional freeze-thaw cycle. Conclusions Measures of Hb and diagnostic performance were fairly stable, even after long-term frozen storage and multiple freeze-thaw cycles of raw faecal samples. Faecal samples collected in prospective screening studies and kept frozen at -80 °C before analysis seem useful for timely and efficient retrospective evaluation of FIT performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646937>Specifying Future Behavior When Assessing Risk Perceptions: Implications for Measurement and Theory.</a></h2><p>. Many theories assert that high perceived risk motivates health behavior change; the empirical literature shows mixed findings. . To determine whether, for whom, and under what circumstances specifying a future behavior when assessing perceived risk (i.e., "conditioning" risk perception items on behavior) improves data quality and strengthens the perceived risk-intentions/behavior relationship. . Internet panel participants ( = 787, 58.8% no college experience, 44.4% racial/ethnic minority, 43.7% men, 67.3% aged 18-49 years, 59.0% nonadherent to physical activity guidelines) answered 8  perceived risk items in a within-subjects design. Participants answered 4 types of risk perception items: absolute and comparative perceived likelihood and absolute and comparative feelings of risk. Participants answered each type of item twice: once conditioned on not engaging in physical activity and once unconditioned. . Compared to unconditioned items, conditioned items elicited fewer "don't know" (DK) responses (OR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68-0.93), higher risk perceptions ( = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.49-0.61) and stronger positive correlations with intentions ( = 5.46,  < 0.001) and behavior ( = 5.10,  < 0.001). The effect of conditioning was more pronounced for perceived likelihood than feelings of risk items (OR = 2.21; 95% CI, 1.63-3.01 and  = 0.14; 95% CI, 0.08-0.20 for DK responding and risk perception magnitude, respectively). The effect on risk perception magnitude (except absolute feelings of risk) was higher among people with higher health literacy (χ(3) = 8.11,  = 0.04). . Researchers who examine whether perceived risk motivates precautionary behavior should consider conditioning risk perception items on behavior to increase the validity of the statistical conclusions they draw and to gain insight into the nature of perceived risk and its relation to behavior.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646062>Transmissible inflammation-induced colorectal  in inflammasome-deficient mice.</a></h2><p>The microbiota is pivotal in orchestrating the pathogenesis of IBD-associated colorectal  (CRC).

There is even evidence that microRNAs can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Although microRNA expression profiles have been characterized in colorectal carcinoma, their precise physiological functions are largely unknown. It has become clear that the activated KRAS Proto‑Oncogene, GTPase (KRAS) oncogene plays an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis. In the present study, it was found that the level of mature miR‑143 was lower in colorectal carcinoma tissues compared with that observed in normal adjacent tissues. A lack of miR‑143 was detected in human colorectal carcinoma cell lines, SW480, LoVo and HT‑29, compared to the high expression observed in normal  epithelial cell line NCM460. pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143 and its mutant were successfully constructed and transfected into colorectal carcinoma cells. Increased accumulation of mature miR‑143 was observed in the pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143‑transfected cells. In SW480 cells, transfection of pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143 resulted in a 35 and 47% reduction in cell growth after incubation for 4 and 5 days, respectively, compared with transfection of the pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143 mutant; while in LoVo cells, transfection of pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143 resulted in a 33 and 46% reduction in cell growth respectively. In contrast, transfection of pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143 had no significantly effects on HT‑29 cell growth. We also found that transfection of pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143 had no effect on levels of KRAS mRNA, but resulted in a 58% decrease in the KRAS protein level in the transfected SW480 cells, while an approximate 54 and 43% KRAS protein reduction in LoVo and HT‑29 cells, respectively, compared with the pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143 mutant. Two fragments containing the putative complementary site were cloned into the pGL3 vector, constructing the luciferase reporter pGL3‑KRAS‑CS1 and pGL3‑KRAS‑CS2. Cotransfection of pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143 with pGL3‑KRAS‑CS1 and pGL3‑KRAS‑CS2 respectively resulted in 4.6‑ and 3.3‑fold inhibition of luciferase activity in the SW480 cells, while a 4.0‑ and 3.2‑fold inhibition of luciferase activity in the LoVo cells, 3.7‑ and 3.1‑fold inhibition in the HT‑29 cells. Differences in pGL3‑KRAS‑CS1 and pGL3‑KRAS‑CS2 activity were not significant. Our results revealed that increased accumulation of miR‑143 is likely to modulate levels of KRAS protein expression at the post‑transcriptional level by interacting specifically with the complementary site, and consequently inhibiting proliferation of the transfected cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657813>[Considerations about the importance of nutritional status in the treatment of advanced colorectal .]</a></h2><p>In patients with gastrointestinal malignancies, i.e. cancers of the stomach, , liver, biliary tract or pancreas, progressive undernutrition can be regularly observed during the course of illness.

During metastasis, tumor cells undergo a morphological change known as transdifferentiation or the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In normal embryonic development, the EMT occurs in the context of morphogenesis in a variety of tissues. Over the course of this process, epithelial cells lose their cell-cell adhesion and polarity properties. In this study, we investigated whether magnolol could suppress the EMT in human colorectal  cells. To this end, we examined the epithelial markers E-cadherin, ZO-1, and claudin and the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, TWIST1, Slug, and Snail. Magnolol effectively inhibited EMT in human  cell lines by upregulating epithelial markers and downregulating mesenchymal markers. The EMT is induced by the TGF-β signaling pathway. To determine whether magnolol disrupts TGF-β signaling, we examined several mediators of this pathway, and found that magnolol decreased the levels of phosphorylated (i.e., active) ERK, GSK3β, and Smad. We conclude that magnolol blocks migration in HCT116 cells by suppressing TGF-β signaling.Copyright © 2019 Chei, Oh, Song, Seo, Lee and Lee.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620912>Population-based analysis on predictors for lymph node metastasis in T1 .</a></h2><p>In this study, we aimed to identify independent predictive factors for lymph node metastasis (LNM) in T1 .Data of 8056 eligible patients were retrospectively collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database during 2004-2012.

Adjusted logistic regression models revealed that mucinous carcinoma [odds ratio (OR) = 2.26, P < 0.001], moderately differentiated (OR 1.74, P < 0.001), poorly differentiated (OR 5.16, P < 0.001), and undifferentiated carcinoma (OR 3.01, P = 0.003); older age (OR 0.66, P < 0.001 for age 65-79 years, OR 0.44, P < 0.001 for age over 80 years); and carcinoma located in the ascending  (OR 0.77, P = 0.018) and sigmoid  (OR 1.24, P = 0.014) were independent predictive factors for LNM. Adjusted Cox regression analysis showed that positive lymph node involvement was significantly associated with CSS [hazard ratio (HR) = 3.02, P < 0.001], which was further robustly confirmed using a competing risks model and the CIF.This population-based study showed that mucinous carcinoma, tumor grade, age, and primary tumor location were independent predictive factors for LNM in T1 . The risk of LNM should be carefully evaluated in patients with T1 , before clinical management.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619605>Dietary Tricin Suppresses Inflammation-Related  Carcinogenesis in Mice.</a></h2><p>Tricin present in rice and wheat exhibits antigrowth activity in several human  cell lines and anti-inflammatory potential. However, the chemopreventive activity has not yet been elucidated in preclinical animal models. This study was designed to determine whether dietary tricin exerts inflammation-associated  carcinogenesis induced by azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in mice. Male Crj: CD-1 mice were initiated with a single i.p. injection of AOM (10 mg/kg bw) and followed by a 1-week exposure to DSS (1.5%, w/v) in drinking water to induce . They were then given the experimental diet containing 50 or 250 ppm tricin. The experiment was terminated at week 18 to determine the chemopreventive efficacy of tricin. The effects of dietary tricin on the expression of several inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, were also assayed. Feeding with tricin at both doses significantly inhibited the development of  tumors. Dietary tricin also significantly reduced the proliferation index and the numbers of mitoses/anaphase bridging of adenocarcinoma cells. Tricin feeding significantly suppressed the TNF-α expression in the normal appearing crypts. Our findings may suggest a potential use of tricin for clinical trials of colorectal  chemoprevention in the inflamed .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637261>Therapeutic Opportunities in Colorectal : Focus on Melatonin Antioncogenic Action.</a></h2><p>Colorectal  (CRC) influences individual health worldwide with high morbidity and mortality. Melatonin, which shows multiple physiological functions (e.g., circadian rhythm, immune modulation, and antioncogenic action), can be present in almost all organisms and found in various tissues including gastrointestinal tract. Notably, melatonin disruption is closely associated with the elevation of CRC incidence, indicating that melatonin is effective in suppressing CRC development and progression. Mechanistically, melatonin favors in activating apoptosis and  immunity, while reducing proliferation, autophagy, metastasis, and angiogenesis, thereby exerting its anticarcinogenic effects. This review highlights that melatonin can be an adjuvant therapy and be beneficial in treating patients suffering from CRC.Copyright © 2019 Hucong Wu et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621365>An update on the I blood group system.</a></h2><p>This update of the I blood group system (Cooling L. Polylactosamines, there's more than meets the "Ii": a review of the I system. Immunohematology 2010;26:133-55) continues to show the Ii antigens to be increasingly recognized as important posttranslational modifiers regulating cell adhesion, signaling, differentiation, and . Ii antigens can modulate the immune response through the galectin lattice, as well as influence specific protein-protein interactions. Changes in GCNT2 and I expression accompany stem cell differentiation and are associated with tumor progression in melanoma and breast and . Regulation of GCNT2 expression varies between cell types and differentiation. In red blood cell differentiation, GCNT2 is regulated by methylation, microRNAs, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. Methylation and microRNAs also play a prominent role in altering GCNT2 expression in several epithelial cancers. In congenital cataracts, GCNT2 mutations may account for 4-6 percent of all cases. GCNT2 may be particularly susceptible to gene deletion and rearrangements due to the density of Alu-repeat elements.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629705>Endoscopic submucosal dissection: Italian national survey on current practices, training and outcomes.</a></h2><p>Most of the evidence supporting endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) comes from Asia. European data are primarily reported by specialized referral centers and thus may not be representative of common European ESD practice. The aim of this study is to understand the current state of ESD practice across Italian endoscopy centers.All Italian endoscopists who were known to perform ESD were invited to complete a structured questionnaire including: operator features and competencies, ESD training details and clinical outcomes over a 2-year period.Twenty-nine operators from 23 centers (69% response rate) completed the questionnaire: 18 (62%) were <50 years old; 7 (24%) were female; 16 (70%) were located in Northern Italy. Overall ESD volume was <40 cases in 9 (31%) operators, 40-80 in 8 (27.5%), 80-150 in 4 (13.8%) and >150 in 8 (27.5%). Colorectal ESD was predominant for operators with an experience >80 cases. En-bloc resection rates ranged from 77.2 to 97.2% depending on the anatomic location with an R0 resection rate range of 75.3-93.6%. ESD perforation rates in the  and rectum were significantly lower when experience was >150 compared to 80-150 cases (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.006 for  and rectum, respectively).ESD in Italy is performed by a significant number of operators. Overall, Italian endoscopists performing ESD have achieved a good competence level. However, there is much variability in training protocols, initial supervision of procedures, practice settings, case mix and procedural volume/year that are likely responsible for some of the suboptimal resectional outcomes and increased perforation risk, mainly in the .

Among these cells are enteric glial cells (EGCs) that are potent regulators of the epithelium functions in a healthy intestine. However, whether EGCs impact CSC-driven tumorigenesis remains unknown.Impact of human EGC primary cultures or a non-transformed EGC line on CSCs isolated from human primary  adenocarcinomas or  cell lines with different p53, MMR system and stemness status was determined using murine xenograft models and 3D co-culture systems. Supernatants of patient-matched human primary  adenocarcinomas and non-adjacent healthy mucosa were used to mimic tumor versus healthy mucosa secretomes and compare their effects on EGCs.Our data show that EGCs stimulate CSC expansion and ability to give rise to tumors via paracrine signaling. Importantly, only EGCs that were pre-activated by tumor epithelial cell-derived soluble factors increased CSC tumorigenicity. Pharmacological inhibition of PGE2 biosynthesis in EGCs or IL-1 knockdown in tumor epithelial cells prevented EGC acquisition of a pro-tumorigenic phenotype. Inhibition of PGE2 receptor EP4 and EGFR in CSCs inhibited the effects of tumor-activated EGCs.Altogether, our results show that EGCs, once activated by the tumor, acquire a pro-tumorigenic phenotype and stimulate CSC-driven tumorigenesis via a PGE2/EP4/EGFR-dependent pathway.This work was supported by grants from the French National  Institute, La Ligue contre le , the 'Région des Pays de la Loire' and the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive  Center.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Preoperative identification of patients at risk for difficult TME may change the operative approach. The objective of this study was to determine if MRI pelvimetry can predict poor-quality surgery in patients undergoing laparoscopic low anterior resection (LAR) for mid- and low rectal .All patients undergoing laparoscopic LAR for rectal  ≤ 9 cm from the anal verge at a single tertiary care referral center from 2011 to 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Pelvic dimensions were measured from preoperative staging MRI on sagittal and axial views. Pelvimetry variables were all dichotomized based on median values. Exploratory factor analysis then identified the most relevant variables for regression analysis. The primary outcome was poor-quality resection, defined as an incomplete mesorectal grade, or involved circumferential (CRM) or distal (DRM) resection margins.There were 92 patients included in this study, of which 70% were male, the mean BMI was 26.0 kg/m, and the mean tumor height was 6.6 cm. Preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy was administered in 70%, and the pathologic T-stage was T3/T4 in 41%. The overall incidence of poor-quality resection was 17%, including 13% incomplete TME, 7% involved CRM, and 1% involved DRM. Factor analysis identified S1-pubic symphysis and the angle between S1 and S5-bottom of symphysis (angle ABD) as relevant variables. After adjusting for pathologic T-stage, BMI, and tumor height, a S1-S5-bottom of symphysis angle > 74.3 (OR 6.19, 95% CI 1.18-32.37) independently predicted poor-quality resection.MRI pelvimetry can identify patients at risk for a poor-quality resection after laparoscopic proctectomy for mid- and low rectal .

Triptolide exerts a unique bioactive spectrum of anticancer activities. The aim of this study was to determine whether triptolide has any effect on the activation of TAMs and the production of tumor-promoting mediators. ICR-1 mice with azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS)-induced  tumors and BALB/c mice co-inoculated with 4T1 cells and M2-polarized RAW264.7 cells were used to examine whether the inhibitory effect of triptolide on tumor progression was mediated by the targeting of TAMs. Real-time PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence staining, and flow cytometry assays were performed to determine the expression of cell surface markers and cytokine production. The results showed that triptolide inhibited macrophage differentiation toward the M2 phenotype and abolished M2 macrophage-mediated tumor progression. Furthermore, triptolide inhibited the expression of M2 markers, such as CD206, Arginase 1, and CD204, and inhibited the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Thus our study indicated that triptolide selectively inhibited the functions of M2-polarized macrophages and TAMs, and this inhibitory effect of triptolide on TAM viability, differentiation, and cytokine production might elucidate the major mechanisms underlying its antitumor activity. Our findings provide important information for the potential clinical application of triptolide in  therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627299>Synergistic Anti-Tumor Effect of mTOR Inhibitors with Irinotecan on  Cells.</a></h2><p>Advanced colorectal  has a poor prognosis because of metastasis formation and resistance to combined therapies. Downstream of PI3K/Akt and Ras/MAPK pathways, the mTOR kinase plays a decisive role in treatment failure. We previously established that irinotecan has antiangiogenic properties and it is known that new mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) catalytic AZD inhibitors, unlike rapamycin, target both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Thus, we hypothesized that the complete inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/HIF-1α axis with mTOR catalytic inhibitors and low doses of irinotecan may have antitumor effects. We showed that the AZD8055 and AZD2014 inhibitors were much more potent than rapamycin to reduce cell viability of four  cell lines. On the other hand, whereas AZD2014 alone inhibits migration by 40%, the drug combination led to 70% inhibition. Similarly, neither irinotecan nor AZD2014 significantly reduced cell invasion, whereas a combination of the two inhibits invasion by 70%. In vivo, irinotecan and AZD2014 combination drastically reduced ectopic patient-derived  tumor growth and this combination was more potent than Folfox or Folfiri. Finally, the combination totally inhibited liver and lung metastases developed from orthotopic implantation of SW480 cells.

Emergency presentation represents about 30% of cases, with increased morbidity and mortality rates. The aim of this study is to compare the perioperative outcome between elderly and non-elderly patients undergoing emergency surgery.We retrospectively analysed CRC patients that underwent emergency surgery at the Departments of Surgery of the Sapienza University Sant'Andrea Hospital in Rome, and at San Donato Hospital in Arezzo, between June 2012 and June 2017. Patients were divided into two groups: non-elderly (< 65 years) and elderly (≥ 65 years). Variables analysed were sex, onset symptoms, associated disease, ASA score, tumor site and TNM stage, surgical procedures and approach, and morbidity and mortality.Of a total of 123 patients, 29 patients were non-elderly and 94 patients were elderly. No significant differences were observed in sex, onset symptoms and tumor site between the two groups. Comorbidities were significantly higher in elderly patients (73.4% vs 41.4%, p<0.001). No significant differences were observed between the two groups in surgical approach and the rate of one-stage procedures. Elderly patients were more frequently treated by Hartmann's procedure compared to non-elderly patients (20.2% vs 6.9%). Left colorectal resection with protective ileostomy was most frequent in the non-elderly group (27.6% vs 11.7%). No significant differences were found in the pT and pN categories of the TNM system between the two groups. However, a higher number of T3 in non-elderly patients was observed. A consistent number of non-oncologically adequate resections were observed in the elderly (21.3% vs 3.5%; p<0.03). The morbidity rate was significantly higher in the elderly group (31.9 % vs 3.4%, p<0.001). No significant difference was found in the mortality rate between the two groups, being 13.8% in the elderly and 6.9% in the non-elderly.Emergency colorectal surgery for  still presents significant morbidity and mortality rates, especially in elderly patients. More aggressive tumors and advanced stages were more frequent in the non-elderly group and as a matter it should be taken into account when treating such patients in the emergency setting in order to perform a radical procedure as much as possible.© 2019 Gianluca Costa et al., published by De Gruyter.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653646>Prevention of colorectal carcinogenesis by DNA binding small molecule curaxin CBL0137 involves suppression of Wnt signaling.</a></h2><p>Chemoprevention is considered a valid approach to reduce the incidence of colorectal  (CRC), one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Here, we investigated the tumor preventive activity of curaxin CBL0137. This compound represents a new class of non-mutagenic DNA-binding small molecules that alter chromatin stability and inhibit the function of the histone chaperone FACT. Among downstream effects of CBL0137 treatment are activation of p53 and type I interferons and inhibition of NF-κB, HSF1 and MYC. In addition, our data show that in both human and mouse CRC cells in vitro CBL0137 inhibits the APC/WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, which plays a key role in  carcinogenesis. Using quantitative RT-PCR and microarray hybridization, we have demonstrated decreased expression of multiple components and downstream targets of the WNT pathway in  cells treated with CBL0137. At the same time, CBL0137 induced expression of WNT antagonists. Inhibition of WNT-signaling activity by CBL0137 was also confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. Tumor preventive activity of CBL0137 in vivo was tested in a murine model of colorectal carcinogenesis induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH), which is known to involve WNT pathway dysregulation. After DMH subcutaneous treatment, mice were administered CBL0137 in drinking water. Efficacy of CBL0137 in suppressing CRC development in this model was evidenced by reduced incidence of adenocarcinomas and adenomas in both males and females, decrease in tumor multiplicity. These data support the prospective use of CBL0137 in chemoprevention of CRC as well as of other malignances associated with activated WNT signaling.Copyright ©2019, American Association for  Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642986>Ropivacaine via nuclear factor kappa B signalling modulates CD62E expression and diminishes tumour cell arrest.</a></h2><p>The issue whether anaesthesia has an impact on the prognosis of carcinoma has been widely discussed and remains debated. Ropivacaine has been widely used in perioperative period as a long acting local anesthetic. An early event during recurrence or metastasis of carcinoma is the adhesion of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) to endothelial cells (ECs) through binding adhesion molecules that are up-regulated on inflamed endothelium during the perioperative period or other periods. This study was to explore the impact of ropivacaine on the adhesion of tumour cells, providing evidences of its influence on the prognosis of carcinoma.Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were pre-treated with ropivacaine (10-10 M; 30 min) prior to treatment with tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) (10 ng ml; 1, 4 and 8 h). Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), endothelial-selectin (CD62E) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) mRNA levels were detected via quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). To clarify the underlying action mechanism, p65, p-p65, IκBα, p-IκBα, IKKα/β and p-IKKα/β protein levels were evaluated via western blotting. Cell viability and tumour cell adhesion assays were also assessed.The clinically usage concentration of ropivacaine (10 M) produced a significant decrease in CD62E expression compared with that produced by TNFα only (p < 0.001). Moreover, adhesion assays showed that ropivacaine effectively inhibited the adhesion of hepatoma cells (p < 0.01), human  cells (p < 0.01) and human leukemic monocyte (p < 0.01). Western blot results showed that pre-treatment with ropivacaine inhibited the phosphorylation of p65 (p < 0.05), IκBα (p < 0.001) and IKKα/β (p < 0.01).Ropivacaine decreased the adhesion of tumour cells. Ropivacaine modulated CD62E expression by inhibiting the activation of NF-κB.

This is an descriptive study. The operation videos of 61 cases (28 males, 33 females, median age of 61) were collected. All the patients underwent laparoscopic colorectal surgery from January 2018 to December 2018 in Yangpu Hospital, including low anterior resection for rectal  in 25 cases, left hemicolectomy for descending  in 15 cases, and subtotal resection of the  for intractable constipation in 21 cases. Among these 21 constipation patients, 8 received additional modified Duhamel surgeries. Gross anatomy was performed on 24 adult cadavers provided by Department of Anatomy, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, including 23 formalin-fixed and 1 fresh cadaver (12 males, 12 females). Sixty-one patients and 24 cadavers had no previous abdominal or pelvic surgical history. The anatomy and extension of fasciae related to descending , sigmoid  and rectum, especially the morphology of Toldt fascia, and the continuities of mesocolon and mesorectum were observed carefully. The distribution characteristics of the fasciae and anatomical landmarks during laparoscopic surgery were recorded and described.  The anatomical study on 24 cadavers showed that visceral fascia was the densest connective tissue in the pelvic, posterolateral to the rectum, and stretched as a hammock to lift all pelvic organs. Among 61 patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery, 36 (59.0%) needed to free the left  during operation, and Toldt fascia in the descending  segment presented as potential, avascular and extensible loose connective tissue plane between the mesocolon and posterior Gerota fascia; 33 (54.1%) needed to free the rectum during operation, and Toldt fascia extended downward to pelvis as loose connective tissue between the fascia propria of the rectum and visceral fascia; the fascia propria of the rectum exposed completely in 32 (32/33, 97.0%) cases, which ran downward and fused with visceral fascia at the level of the fourth sacral vertebra. The anatomy of 24 cadavers also showed that fascia propria of the rectum fused with visceral fascia at the level of Waldeyer fascia. The fusion line of these two fasciae was supposed to be the extension of Waldeyer fascia. There were two avascular planes behind the rectum: one between the fascia propria of the rectum and visceral fascia, and the other between the visceral fascia and parietal fascia. In 8 constipation cases undergoing laparoscopic subtotal  resection plus modified Duhamel operation, both mesocolon and mesorectum needed to be mobilized. It was obvious that the mesocolon of descending  extended and became the mesocolon of sigmoid , and ran further into the pelvic and became the mesorectum. The  fascia of descending  served as the natural boundary of mesocolon extended downward as the fascia of sigmoid  and the fascia propria of the rectum, respectively. Toldt fascia locating between mesocolon of descending  and Gerota fascia extended to pelvis as the 'presacral space' between the fascia propria of the rectum and visceral fascia. Gerota fascia in descending  segment extended as urogenital fascia in sigmoid  segment and visceral fascia in the pelvis, respectively. In the cadaver anatomy study, the visceral fascia served as a corridor carrying the hypogastric nerve, and ureter was observed in 23 (23/24, 95.8%) cases. The visceral fascia passed from posterior to anterior lateral of rectum, fusing with Denonvilliers fascia in a fan shape. The pelvic plexus located exactly external to the junction of visceral fascia and Denonvilliers fascia. Pelvic splanchnic nerves went through the parietal fascia toward to the inferolateral of the pelvic plexus.  Fascia propria of the rectum and the visceral pelvic fascia are two independent layers of fascia, and the TME surgical plane is between the fascia propria of the rectum and visceral pelvic fascia instead of between the visceral and the parietal pelvic fascia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633602>Uptake of Total Mesorectal Excision and Total Mesorectal Excision Grading for Rectal : A Statewide Study.</a></h2><p>Total mesorectal excision is associated with decreased local recurrence and improved disease-free survival following rectal  resection.

Trends in total mesorectal excision performance and grade assignment were analyzed by using χ tests and linear regression.Participating hospitals (initially 14 hospitals, now 38) abstracted medical records data for rectal  cases from 2007 to 2016.Patients who underwent rectal  resection were included.The main outcome measures were surgeon-documented total mesorectal excision performance and pathologist-reported total mesorectal excision grade.Of 510 rectal  cases, 367 (72.0%) had surgeon-reported total mesorectal excision performance and 78 (15.3%) had pathologist-reported total mesorectal excision grade. Between-hospital variability in total mesorectal excision performance ranged from 0% to 97% and total mesorectal excision grading ranged from 0% to 90%. Total mesorectal excision grading was associated with a higher likelihood of also having adequate lymph node assessment (88.5% versus 71.9%, p = 0.002). There has been a statistically significant trend toward an increase in total mesorectal excision grading in the original 14 hospitals (p = 0.001), but not in the complete cohort of all hospitals (p = 0.057).This is a retrospective cohort design with sampled rectal  cases. In addition, there is insufficient granularity to capture all factors associated with total mesorectal excision performance or grade assignment.The rates of total mesorectal excision performance and grade assignment are widely variable throughout the state of Michigan. Overall, grade assignment remains very low. This suggests an opportunity for quality improvement projects to increase total mesorectal excision performance and grading, involving both the surgeons and pathologists for effective implementation.

Overall, 12 patients had an anastomotic leak requiring intervention within 30 days: 5 in the high ligation group (3.2%, 95% CI 1.4-7.2%) and 7 in the low ligation group (5.7%, 95% CI 2.8-11.3%). There was no association between the level of ligation and anastomotic leak (unadjusted OR 1.85, 95% CI 0.58-6.38; adjusted OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.16-2.55). Similarly, there was no association between the level of ligation and reoperation for anastomotic leak (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.15-10.9), major complications (Clavien-Dindo III-V; OR 2.22, 95% CI 0.90-5.77), minor complications (Clavien-Dindo I-II; OR 1.51, 95% CI 0.88-2.60), and all complications (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.94-2.67). No deaths occurred in either group.There was no association of level of ligation of the IMA with anastomotic leak, postoperative complications as a composite, or death. The choice of high or low ligation of the IMA should be made based on technical factors such as length for the creation of a tension-free anastomosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620246>GSTΠ stimulates caveolin-1-regulated polyamine uptake via actin remodeling.</a></h2><p>Polyamines spermidine and spermine, and their diamine precursor putrescine, are essential for normal cellular functions in both pro- and eukaryotes. Cellular polyamine levels are regulated by biosynthesis, degradation and transport. Transport of dietary and luminal bacterial polyamines in gastrointestinal (GI) tissues plays a significant role in tissue polyamine homeostasis. We have reported that caveolin-1 play an inhibitory role in polyamine uptake in GI tissues. We investigated the mechanism of caveolin-1-regulated polyamine transport. We found that glutathione -transferase Π(GSTΠ) was secreted from caveolin-1 knockdown cells and stimulated spermidine transport in human -derived HCT116 cells. GSTΠ secreted in the medium increased -glutathionylated protein level in the plasma membrane fraction. Proteomic analysis revealed that actin was -glutathionylated by GSTΠ. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that actin filaments around plasma membrane were -glutathionylated in caveolin-1 knockdown cells. Inhibition of actin remodeling by jasplakinolide caused a decrease in polyamine uptake activity. These data support a model in which caveolin-1 negatively regulates polyamine uptake by inhibiting GSTΠ secretion, which stimulates actin remodeling and endocytosis.Copyright: © 2019 Uemura et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661001>Targeting CXCR4 potentiates anti-PD-1 efficacy modifying the tumor microenvironment and inhibiting neoplastic PD-1.</a></h2><p>Inefficient T-cell access to the tumor microenvironment (TME) is among the causes of tumor immune-resistance. Previous evidence demonstrated that targeting CXCR4 improves anti-PD-1/PD-L1 efficacy reshaping TME. To evaluate the role of newly developed CXCR4 antagonists (PCT/IB2011/000120/ EP2528936B1/US2013/0079292A1) in potentiating anti-PD-1 efficacy two syngeneic murine models, the MC38  and the B16 melanoma-human CXCR4-transduced, were employed.Mice were subcutaneously injected with MC38 (1 × 10) or B16-hCXCR4 (5 × 10). After two weeks, tumors bearing mice were intraperitoneally (ip) treated with murine anti-PD-1 [RMP1-14] (5 mg/kg, twice week for 2 weeks), Pep R (2 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 2 weeks), or both agents. The TME was evaluated through immunohistochemistry and flow-cytometry. In addition, the effects of the human-anti-PD-1 nivolumab and/or Peptide-R54 (Pep R54), were evaluated on human melanoma PES43 cells and xenografts treated.The combined treatment, Pep R plus anti-PD-1, reduced the MC38 Relative Tumor Volume (RTV) by 2.67 fold (p = 0.038) while nor anti-PD-1, neither Pep R significantly impacted on tumor growth. Significant higher number of Granzyme B (GZMB) positive cells was detected in MC38 tumors from mice treated with the combined treatment (p = 0.016) while anti-PD-1 determined a modest but significant increase of tumor-infiltrating GZMB positive cells (p = 0.035). Also, a lower number of FoxP3 positive cells was detected (p = 0.022). In the B16-hCXCR4 tumors, two weeks of combined treatment reduced tumor volume by 2.27 fold while nor anti-PD-1 neither Pep R significantly impacted on tumor growth. A significant higher number of GRZB positive cells was observed in B16-hCXCR4 tumors treated with combined treatment (p = 0,0015) as compared to anti-PD-1 (p = 0.028). The combined treatment reduced CXCR4, CXCL12 and PD-L1 expression in MC38 tumors. In addition, flow cytometry on fresh B16-hCXCR4 tumors showed significantly higher Tregs number following anti-PD-1 partially reversed by the combined treatment Pep R and anti-PD-1. Combined treatment determined an increase of CD8/Tregs and CD8/MDSC ratio. To dissect the effect of anti-PD-1 and CXCR4 targeting on PD-1 expressed by human  cells, PES43 human melanoma xenograft model was employed. In vitro human anti-PD-1 nivolumab or pembrolizumab (10 μM) reduced PES43 cells growth while nivolumab (10 μM) inhibited pERK1/2, P38 MAPK, pAKT and p4EBP. PES43 xenograft mice were treated with Pep R54, a newly developed Pep R derivative (AcHN-Arg-Ala-[DCys-Arg- Nal(2')-His-Pen]- COOH), plus nivolumab. After 3 weeks of combined treatment a significant reduction in tumor growth was shown (p = 0.038). PES43 lung disseminated tumor cells (DTC) were detected in fresh lung tissues as melanoma positive MCSP-APC cells. Although not statistically significant, DTC-PES43 cells were reduced in mice lungs treated with combined treatment while nivolumab or Pep R54 did not affect DTC number.Combined treatment with the new developed CXCR4 antagonist, Pep R, plus anti-PD-1, reduced tumor-growth in two syngeneic murine models, anti-PD-1 sensitive and resistant, potentiating Granzyme and reducing Foxp3 cells infiltration. In addition, the human specific CXCR4 antagonist, Pep R54, cooperated with nivolumab in inhibiting the growth of the PD-1 expressing human PES43 melanoma xenograft. This evidence sheds light on PD-1 targeting mechanisms and paves the way for CXCR4/PD-1 targeting combination therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641892>Optimization of Inositol Hexaphosphate  Targeted Formulation for Anticarcinogenic Marker Modulation.</a></h2><p>Colorectal  has become the third most frequent reason of  death in men and women. Currently, natural compounds are being looked up to, for subversion and deterrence of cancers. Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) is one such naturally occurring phosphorylated carbohydrate present in most legumes and cereals which acts as a potential antineoplastic agent and can be used effectively to prevent and treat  carcinomas. Despite the immense potential, due to the prevalence of high charge and ability to form salts and chelates with various divalent metals, it gets excreted out quickly from the body. On reaching the  in its original form, it can serve as an effective anticancer agent. Therefore, a suitable dosage form that can prevent the drugs from being absorbed from the upper gastrointestinal tract is required to be prepared, to target it to the . Thus, microspheres of IP6 using a biodegradable polymer that degrades in the  were attempted using the solvent evaporation method. The formulation was investigated for percentage yield, encapsulation efficiency, particle size distribution modification, and release rate. Optimized formulation showed particle size of 92 ± 0.76 μm, entrapment efficiency of 67.26% ± 0.75, percent drug loading of 15.74%, and in vitro drug release 82.36 ± 0.51. The results of the in vivo study divulged that IP6 loaded pectin microspheres showed significant positive modulation of biomarker levels and restoration of  architecture to almost normal as observed through histopathology and scanning electron microscopy studies in DMH-induced  tumors in Albino Wistar rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619233>Genome-wide discovery and characterization of long noncoding RNAs in patients with multiple myeloma.</a></h2><p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in a wide range of biological processes in tumorigenesis. However, the role of lncRNA expression in the biology, prognosis, and molecular classification of human multiple myeloma (MM) remains unclear, especially the biological functions of the vast majority of lncRNAs. Recently, lncRNAs have been identified in neoplastic hematologic disorders. Evidence has accumulated on the molecular mechanisms of action of lncRNAs, providing insight into their functional roles in tumorigenesis. This study aimed to characterize potential lncRNAs in patients with MM.In this study, the whole-transcriptome strand-specific RNA sequencing of samples from three newly diagnosed patients with MM was performed. The whole transcriptome, including lncRNAs, microRNAs, and mRNAs, was analyzed. Using these data, MM lncRNAs were systematically analyzed, and the lncRNAs involved in the occurrence of MM were identified.The results revealed that MM lncRNAs had distinctive characteristics different from those of other malignant tumors. Further, the functions of a set of lncRNAs preferentially expressed in MM were verified, and several lncRNAs were identified as competing endogenous RNAs. More importantly, the aberrant expression of certain lncRNAs, including maternally expressed gene3, -associated transcript1, and coiled-coil domain-containing 26, as well as some novel lncRNAs involved in the occurrence of MM was established. Further, lncRNAs were related to some microRNAs, regulated each other, and participated in MM development.Genome-wide screening and functional analysis enabled the identification of a set of lncRNAs involved in the occurrence of MM. The interaction exists among microRNAs and lncRNAs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658051>Erythrocyte deformability and aggregability in patients undergoing  surgery and effects of two infusions with omega-3 fatty acids.</a></h2><p>An adequate erythrocyte function is vital for tissue oxygenation and wound healing. The erythrocyte membrane phospholipid composition plays an important role in erythrocyte function and administration of omega-3 fatty acids may provide a means to improve it.To investigate peri-operative erythrocyte function and effects of omega-3 fatty acidsMETHODS:Forty-four patients undergoing elective laparoscopic  resection for non-metastasized  were randomized between intravenous omega-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) or placebo (saline). Peri-operative blood samples were analyzed with a Lorrca MaxSIS Ektacytometer and erythrocyte membrane phospholipids were determined with gas chromatography.Patient and operation characteristics were equal between groups. There was a significant increase in erythrocyte membrane eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) but not docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the n-PUFA group. There were no significant differences in erythrocyte deformability but the aggregation index (AI) was significantly lower and the aggregation half time (T½) was significantly higher in the n-3 PUFA group.This study confirms rapid changes in erythrocyte membrane phospholipid composition after administration of intravenous n-3 PUFAs. Erythrocyte deformability parameters were not affected but erythrocyte aggregability was decreased in the n-3 PUFA group.

Emerging evidence indicates that tumour cells release substantial amounts of RNA into the bloodstream, in which RNA strongly resists RNases and is present at sufficient levels for quantitative analyses. This study aimed to discover blood-based markers for the early detection of CRC and to ascertain their efficiency in discriminating healthy controls, patients with polyps and adenomas and  patients. We first analysed and screened ZFAS1, SNHG11, LINC00909 and LINC00654 in a bioinformatics database and then collected clinical plasma samples for a preliminary small-scale analysis and further large-scale verification. We then explored the mechanism of dominant lncRNA SNHG11 expression in CRC by in vitro and in vivo assays. The combination of ZFAS1, SNHG11, LINC00909 and LINC00654 showed high diagnostic performance for CRC (AUC: 0.937), especially early-stage disease (AUC: 0.935). Plasma levels of the four candidate lncRNAs were significantly reduced in post-operative samples compared to pre-operative samples. A panel including these four lncRNAs performed well in distinguishing patient groups with different stages of  disease, and SNHG11 exhibited the greatest diagnostic ability to identify precancerous lesions and early-stage tumour formation. Mechanistically, high SNHG11 expression promotes proliferation and metastasis by targeting the Hippo pathway. Taken together, the data indicate that SNHG11 may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of CRC and a potential biomarker for the early detection of CRC.

In a previous study, we showed that a measles virus Schwarz vaccine strain (MeVac) vector encoding an interleukin-12 fusion protein (FmIL-12) is an effective immunotherapy in the MC38cea murine  adenocarcinoma model. We hypothesized that MeVac encoding interleukin-15 may mediate enhanced T and NK cell responses and thus increase the therapeutic efficacy, especially in NK cell-controlled tumors. Therefore, we generated MeVac vectors encoding an interleukin-15 superagonist, FmIL-15. Replication and oncolytic capacity, transgene expression, and functionality of MeVac FmIL-15 vectors were validated in vitro. Effects on the tumor immune landscape and therapeutic efficacy of both FmIL-12 and FmIL-15 vectors were studied in the MC38cea and B16hCD46 tumor models. Treatment with MeVac FmIL-15 increased T and NK cell infiltration in both models. However, MeVac FmIL-12 showed more robust viral gene expression and immune activation, resulting in superior anti-tumor efficacy. Based on these results, MeVac encoding a human IL-12 fusion protein was developed for future clinical translation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636762>Survival by  stage and screening interval in Lynch syndrome: a prospective Lynch syndrome database report.</a></h2><p>We previously reported that in pathogenic mismatch repair () variant carriers, the incidence of colorectal  (CRC) was not reduced when colonoscopy was undertaken more frequently than once every 3 years, and that CRC stage and interval since last colonoscopy were not correlated.The Prospective Lynch Syndrome Database (PLSD) that records outcomes of surveillance was examined to determine survival after  in relation to the time since previous colonoscopy and pathological stage.

However, which patients remain at high risk of recurrence after completing standard adjuvant treatment cannot currently be determined. Postsurgical circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis can detect minimal residual disease and is associated with recurrence in colorectal cancers.To determine whether serial postsurgical and postchemotherapy ctDNA analysis could provide a real-time indication of adjuvant therapy efficacy in stage III .This multicenter, Australian, population-based cohort biomarker study recruited 100 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed stage III  planned for 24 weeks of adjuvant chemotherapy from November 1, 2014, through May 31, 2017. Patients with another malignant neoplasm diagnosed within the last 3 years were excluded. Median duration of follow-up was 28.9 months (range, 11.6-46.4 months). Physicians were blinded to ctDNA results. Data were analyzed from December 10, 2018, through June 23, 2019.Serial plasma samples were collected after surgery and after chemotherapy.

At least 1 somatic mutation was identified in the tumor tissue of all 96 evaluable patients. Circulating tumor DNA was detectable in 20 of 96 (21%) postsurgical samples and was associated with inferior recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 3.8; 95% CI, 2.4-21.0; P < .001). Circulating tumor DNA was detectable in 15 of 88 (17%) postchemotherapy samples. The estimated 3-year RFI was 30% when ctDNA was detectable after chemotherapy and 77% when ctDNA was undetectable (HR, 6.8; 95% CI, 11.0-157.0; P < .001). Postsurgical ctDNA status remained independently associated with RFI after adjusting for known clinicopathologic risk factors (HR, 7.5; 95% CI, 3.5-16.1; P < .001).Results suggest that ctDNA analysis after surgery is a promising prognostic marker in stage III . Postchemotherapy ctDNA analysis may define a patient subset that remains at high risk of recurrence despite completing standard adjuvant treatment.

Though BMP3 is a reliable biomarker for screening CRC, the molecular mechanism of BMP3 in carcinogenesis remains largely unknown.The expression level of BMP3 was examined by immunohistochemistry staining and western blot. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and real-time quantitative MSP were used to test the hypermethylation status of BMP3 gene. Analyses of BMP3 function in  cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were performed using HCT116 and KM12 cells. BMP3 was further knocked down or overexpressed in CRC cells, and the effects on cell growth of xenograft tumors in nude mice were assessed. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence staining were used to analyze the association between BMP3 and BMPR2 or BMP3 and ActRIIB. Microarray analysis was performed to identify most differentially expressed genes and pathways regulated by BMP3. The BMP3-regulated SMAD2-dependent signaling pathway and TAK1/JNK signal axes were further investigated by quantitative PCR and western blot.BMP3 gene was hypermethylated and its expression was downregulated in both CRC tissues and cell lines. Expressing exogenous BMP3 in HCT116 inhibited cell growth, migration, and invasion and increased rate of apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. However, shRNA-mediated attenuation of endogenous BMP3 in KM12 reversed such inhibitory and apoptotic effects. Furthermore, BMP3 could bind to ActRIIB, an activin type II receptor at the cellular membrane, thereby activating SMAD2-dependent pathway and TAK1/JNK signal axes to regulate downstream targets including caspase-7, p21, and SMAD4 that play crucial roles in cell cycle control and apoptosis.Our study reveals a previously unknown mechanism of BMP3 tumor suppression in CRC and provides a rationale for future investigation of BMP3 as a potential target for the development of novel therapeutic agents to fight CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656692>The Cytotoxic Effects of Geranylgeranylacetone Are Attenuated in the High-Glucose Condition.</a></h2><p>Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA) has been used as an antiulcer drug and also is known as inducer of heat shock protein 70 that has cytoprotective effects especially in hyperglycemic condition.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether GGA can have a cytotoxic effect on a human cervical  cell line (HeLa), human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2), and human embryonic kidney cells 293 (HEK) in normal-glucose and high-glucose environments (NG and HG, respectively). The results showed that 100 μM GGA inhibited proliferation of HeLa cells only in NG environment despite inhibiting proliferation of Caco-2 and HEK cells regardless of glucose concentration. Cell viability assay revealed that GGA decreased viability of HeLa, Caco-2, and HEK cells only in NG environment. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that the type of cell death was a combination of necrosis and apoptosis. Our study revealed that difference in cytotoxicity of GGA is influenced by glucose condition. The cytotoxic effects of GGA are attenuated in the HG condition. Since both cytotoxic and cytoprotective effects are reported about GGA, further research is needed about the mechanism of the cytotoxic effects.© Yuko Nakano et al. 2019; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644719>Splenic flexure mobilization in sigmoid and rectal  resections: a meta-analysis of surgical outcomes.</a></h2><p>to evaluate the influence of the splenic flexure mobilization for the main surgical outcomes of patients submitted to resection of sigmoid and rectal .we searched the MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and LILACS, using the terms "splenic flexure mobilization", "colorectal surgery", "rectal ", "anterior resection", "sigmoid ", and "sigmoid resection".

As the prevalence of thyroid  increases worldwide, thyroid  survivorship is associated with increasing personal and cumulative costs. Few studies have examined the psychological and material economic costs experienced by thyroid  survivors. We seek to estimate the comparative prevalence of financial and psychological hardship among thyroid  and non-thyroid  patients in the United States.The 2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Experiences with  databank was queried to identify thyroid and non-thyroid (, breast, lung, prostate)  survivors. This survey includes assessments of financial stress, material hardship, and psychological financial hardship.  incidence-based weighted estimates of responses were compared between thyroid and non-thyroid  survivors. Independent predictors of material and psychological financial burden were identified through separate multivariate regression models.Thyroid  survivors more frequently reported psychological financial burden compared to non-thyroid  (46.1% vs 24.0%, P = .04). Material financial hardship (28.1% vs 19.9%, P = .37) and concurrent material and psychological hardship (25.1% vs 12.5%, P = .09) were noted at similar frequencies between thyroid and non-thyroid  survivors. However, on multivariate analysis, only younger age and lack of health insurance coverage were independently associated with psychological financial hardship.Thyroid  survivors report greater psychological financial hardship than non-thyroid  survivors. Because this financial burden may be underrecognized in the medical community, further studies should be conducted to aid physicians in better understanding the impact of a thyroid  diagnosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Thirty-two male Wistar albino rats were allocated into four groups: Control, AOM, AOM + JB, and JB groups. Whereas the control group was fed with standard pellet feed, the AOM and AOM + JB groups were administered of AOM (15 mg/kg body weight) subcutaneously once every 2 weeks for 10 weeks. AOM + JB and JB groups additionally received JB oil (100 µl/kg) orally. At the end of the 16-week experimental period, blood and tissue samples were obtained from the rats following necropsy. The macroscopic findings showed that the application of JB oil significantly decreased adenoma and adenocarcinoma formation both numerically and dimensionally. Immunohistochemically, CEA, COX-2, and Ki-67 immune-expressions decreased, and the immune-expression of caspase-3 increased in AOM + JB treated rats. Additionally, JB oil supplementation ameliorated antioxidant defense systems and lipid peroxidation within the  tissue of AOM + JB treated rats. These results reveal that the JB oil acted as a chemopreventive dietary agent, inhibiting cell proliferation and COX-2 expression and inducing apoptosis, resulting in a significant reduction in  tumor formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618463>Inhibitory Effects of Pectinase-Treated Prunus Mume Fruit Concentrate on Colorectal  Proliferation and Angiogenesis of Endothelial Cells.</a></h2><p>Pectinase is a well-known enzyme used in the food processing industry to produce fruit juice and concentrate. This study evaluated the anticancer and antiangiogenesis activities of pectinase-treated Prunus mume fruit concentrate (PC) and its phenolic components. PC treatment (250 to 1,000 µg/mL) resulted in decreased proliferation of SW480 human colorectal  cells through S-phase cell cycle arrest; however, equivalent concentrations of PC did not show toxicity toward CRL-1539  normal cells. Furthermore, PC-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in SW480 cells, which was characterized by accumulation of apoptotic cell population, cell shrinkage, formation of apoptotic bodies, upregulation of proapoptotic Bax, cleaved PARP, caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9, and downregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2. Antiangiogenesis effects of PC were assessed using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that PC did not inhibit HUVECs proliferation at concentrations of 500 to 1,500 µg/mL. In addition, treatment with PC at nontoxic concentrations (500 to 1,000 µg/mL) blocked vascular endothelial growth factor induced cell migration, invasion, capillary-like tube formation, and angiogenesis from rat aortic rings. HPLC-PDA analysis showed that there were at least four different phenolics including 5-HMF, neochlorogenic acid, protocatechuic acid, and syringic acid. Taken together, these results indicated that PC could be used as a good source of phenolic compounds with selective anticancer and antiangiogenesis activities. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Pectinases are one of the well-known enzyme used in the part of food processing. Treatment of pectinase is a useful strategy to reduce viscosity, turbidity, and pulp particles in the production of fruit juice, extract, and concentrate. In the present study, we found that pectinase-treated P. mume fruit concentrate significantly suppresses colorectal  proliferation and angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The significance of our findings is that pectinase-treated P. mume concentrate may be used as a commercial functional food material to inhibit colorectal  and angiogenesis.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626200>[Differential diagnostic value of the expression of the transcription factor PDX-1 in neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas and other organs].</a></h2><p>An important role in the differentiation of tissues in different organs is played by transforming factors (TFs); pancreatic and duodenal homebox 1 (PDX-1) is one of the earliest factors for pancreatic cells. Many malignant tumors, including neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), are similar in structure, and therefore the actual problem of oncomorphology is to search for narrow-specific markers and TFs.to comparatively analyze and assess the value of the expression of the TF PDX-1 in NETs and non-NETs of different localization and histogenetic origin.Anti-PDX-1 antibodies were used to study 528 tumors divided into 3 groups: Group 1 included 394 NETs, among them there were those of the pancreas (n=173), stomach (n=46), bowel (n=65), lung (n=40), thymus (n=8), kidney (n=6), Merkel's cell carcinomas (n=14), NETs of the breast (n=3), larynx (n=2), trachea (n=2), bladder (n=1), and metastatic NETs (n=34) of unknown primary site; Group 2 consisted of 16 tumors, of them there were paragangliomas (n=6), medullary thyroid cancers (MTC) (n=6) and adrenal pheochromocytomas (APCC) (n=4); Group 3 comprised 118 non-NETs, among them there were tumors of the pancreas (n=54), stomach (n=26), bowel (n=17), lung (n=11), breast (n=3), kidney (n=4), adrenal glands (n=2), and bladder (n=1).PDX-1 was positive in 75.1% (130/173) of pancreatic NETs, all insulinomas (50/50), gastrinomas (11/11), somatostatinomas (3/3), ACTH-producing tumors (2/2); PDX-1 was positive in the non-functioning pancreatic NETs, all PPomas (19/19), 76.1% (35/46) of NETs without the hormone detected, 50% (2/4) of calcitoninomas, and 21.1% (8/38) of silent glucagonomas. PDX-1 was positive in 32.4% (11/34) of carcinoids and 50% (6/12) of neuroendocrine carcinomas, all duodenal NETs (18/18), 90% (9/10) of rectal carcinoids and 30.8% (4/13)  carcinoids, 37.5% (3/8) of thymic/mediastinal carcinoids, 66.7% (4/6) of kidney carcinoids, and 37.5% (9/24) of metastatic NETs of unknown primary site.

We have identified that mitotic regulator microtubule-associated protein 9 (MAP9) as a critical regulator of CIN in CRC. We thus studied the effect of MAP9 loss on CRC in Map9 knockout mice and in cell lines.We generated  epithelial-specific Map9 knockout mice and evaluated CRC development. Effect of Map9 knockout on CRC progression was determined in chemical or ApcMin/+-induced CRC. Molecular mechanism of MAP9 was determined using spectral karyotyping (SKY), microtubule assays and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Clinical significance of MAP9 was examined in 141 CRC patients.Spontaneous  tumors (9.1%) were developed in  epithelium-specific Map9 knockout mice at 17 months, but none was observed in wildtype littermates. Map9 deletion accelerated CRC formation both in ApcMin/+ mice and azoxymethane-treated mice, and reduced survival in ApcMin/+ mice. Mechanistically, MAP9 stabilized microtubules and mediated mitotic spindle assembly. MAP9 also maintained the spindle pole integrity and protected K-fibre from depolymerization at spindle poles. MAP9 loss induced severe mitosis failure, chromosome segregation errors and aneuploidy, leading to transformation of normal  epithelial cells. WGS confirmed enhanced CIN in intestinal tumors from Map9 knockout ApcMin/+ mice. In CRC patients, MAP9 was frequently silenced and its down-regulation was associated with poor survival.MAP9 is a microtubule stabilizer that contributes to spindle stability and inhibits colorectal tumorigenesis, supporting the role of MAP9 as a tumor suppressor for preventing CIN in CRC.Copyright ©2019, American Association for  Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629719>Accuracy of  capsule for advanced neoplasia.</a></h2><p>Promising accuracy of  capsule endoscopy (CCE-2) has been shown for overall neoplasia. Advanced neoplasia (AN) represents the main target of colorectal  screening programs. Our aim was to assess CCE-2 diagnostic accuracy for the detection of AN in FIT+ screenees.Subjects aged 50 to 69, with a positive FIT in 4 population screening programs in Italy and Spain were enrolled. Screenees were asked to perform CCE-2, followed by traditional colonoscopy (TC). TC was performed the same day or the following morning. Bowel preparation included a split PEG-based regimen and sodium phosphate (NaP) with gastografin as boosters. CCE-2 video was read by an endoscopist blinded to the results of TC. The main outcomes were CCE-2 accuracy in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for AN when using 2 different-sized thresholds for TC referral (ie, >6 or >10 mm polyp).Two hundred twenty-two subjects were enrolled, and 178 patients completed both CCE-2 and TC examination (87.7%). Overall, 59 cases of AN were detected at TC. Overall, CCE-2 sensitivity was 90%, specificity was 66.1%, PPV was 57.4%, and NPV was 92.9% for AN when using a 6 mm cut-off (TC referral rate: 52.8%) and 76.7%, 90.7%, 80.7%, 88.4% when using 10 mm cut-off (TC referral rate: 32%), respectively. CCE-2 detected that 8 out of 9 already developed CRC. Among the 41 false-positives at 6-mm cut-off, 34 (82.9%) presented with a nonadvanced adenoma at TC. Mean transit time was 4:04 hours and >70% of patients excreted CCE within 5 hours.In an enriched-disease setting, we showed the high sensitivity of CCE-2 for advanced neoplasia at 6 mm cut-off. The apparently low CCE-2 specificity is related to the choice of AN as the main outcome.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Various factors have been studied to identify patients at risk of developing peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC), including T4 tumors. The objectives were to assess the incidence of synchronous and metachronous PC, explore potential risk factors for developing PC as the only site of metastasis, and identify which patients might be candidates for prophylactic hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).We conducted a retrospective analysis of 125 patients with pT4  who underwent surgery in a single center between January 2010 and December 2014.Of the 947  patients who underwent surgery, 125 (13.2%) were diagnosed with pT4a or b  carcinoma. The median follow-up was 3.7 years. The overall rate of PC was 34.3%, being synchronous in 12% and metachronous in 22.3% of cases. The 8% and 6% of synchronous and metachronous cases of PC respectively were isolated (single site) metastasis. The incidence of PC was 6.1% at 1 year and 14.5% at 3 years after surgery. pT4 was not found to be an independent risk factor for the development of PC (p = 0.231). Nonetheless, the rate of metachronous PC as a single site of metastasis was higher in patients with pT4 tumors and peritoneal nodules around the primary tumor and/or tumor perforation (p = 0.027) and/or who underwent emergency surgery (p = 0.043) than other patients.Considering pT4 tumor stage as the only risk factor for the development of PC in deciding whether to administer prophylactic HIPEC would lead to unjustified overtreatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627907>[Does sentinel lymph node identification has indication in digestive cancers?]</a></h2><p>Despite being a standard of care in several cancers, sentinel lymph node (SLN) is not widespread in digestive cancers. European guidelines do not recommend its use for any digestive cancers. Particularity of the lymphatic vessel, intimately linked to blood vessel, may explain part of this phenomenon. Nevertheless, more indication could arise in the near future with the early diagnosis of tumor induced by  screening. Ruling out the lymphatic invasion could allow preserving the organ currently resected because of risk of lymph node positivity. This procedure is well studied in early gastric  in Korea and Japan. Several study have demonstrated that, a dual-tracer (isotopic and dye) allows to accurately identify the SLN. A randomized phase 3 trial is currently active in Korea to evaluate the oncological results of the procedure. Similar indication could arise for T1 tumor of the low-rectum, but currently available data are insufficient to recommend its use outside of a study. SLN may also be used to detect aberrant lymphatic drainage (rectum, ileum) but have been tested so far only in a few dozen of patients. Finally, SLN is disappointing in , due to its low sensitivity and the absence of modification of the surgical procedure induced.Copyright © 2019 Société Française du .

Surgical care is essential for the treatment. Many patients do not have access to curative surgery for colorectal  in rural Kenya. To better understand the impact of surgical care on colorectal  in a resource-limited setting, we compared the experience of patients undergoing operations to those who did not.All patients with histologically confirmed CRC at Tenwek Hospital from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2017, were reviewed. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from records when available. The exposure was either curative operation, palliative operation, or no operation. The primary outcome was survival at 5 years, assessed with Cox proportional hazard analysis after propensity-score matching for age, sex, tumor site, time period, and stage.One hundred and sixty-five patients were identified on chart review. Survival information was available for 150 patients with a median follow-up of 319 days. Fifty-two percent had  and 48% had rectal . At diagnosis, the mean age was 55.4 years (SD: 16.7) and the male to female ratio was 1.1:1. Thirty-nine percent underwent curative operations, 25% palliative operations, and 36% no operations. One-year survival was estimated to be 98% for curative surgery, 73% for palliative surgery, and 83% for no surgery (p = 0.0005). On crude analysis, 5-year survival improved with curative operation in comparison to no operation with a hazard ratio of 0.30 (CI: 0.14-0.64) (p = 0.002). After propensity matching, the hazard ratio for curative operation versus no operation remained significant, 0.34 (CI: 0.14-0.80) (p = 0.01).Curative surgery improves survival in our resource-limited environment. Although various factors contribute to the use of surgical treatment, the survival advantage persists after adjusted analysis. Barriers exist for access to prompt surgical evaluation and treatment.

Activation of the WNT pathway ultimately leads to the nuclear translocation of β-catenin which, in complex with TCF/LEF factors, promotes the transcription of genes necessary for growth. The proto-oncogene MYC is one of the most critical genes activated downstream the WNT pathway in . Here, we investigate the converse regulation of the WNT pathway by MYC.We performed RNA-seq analyses to identify genes regulated in cells expressing MYC. We validated the regulation of genes in the WNT pathway including LEF1 by MYC using RT-qPCR, Western blotting, and ChIP-seq. We investigated the importance of LEF1 for the viability of MYC-expressing cells in in fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and  cells. Bioinformatic analyses were utilized to define the expression of MYC-regulated genes in human  and metabolomics analyses were used to identify pathways regulated by LEF1 in MYC expressing cells.MYC regulates the levels of numerous WNT-related genes, including the β-catenin co-transcription factor LEF1. MYC activates the transcription of LEF1 and is required for LEF1 expression in  cells and in primary  cells transformed by APC loss of function, a common mutation in  patients. LEF1 caused the retention of β-catenin in the nucleus, leading to the activation of the WNT pathway in MYC-expressing cells. Consequently, MYC-expressing cells were sensitive to LEF1 inhibition. Moreover, we describe two examples of genes induced in MYC-expressing cells that require LEF1 activity: the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta (PPARδ) and the Acyl CoA dehydrogenase 9 (ACAD9).We demonstrated that MYC is a transcriptional regulator of LEF1 in  cells. Our work proposes a novel pathway by which MYC regulates proliferation through activating LEF1 expression which in turn activates the WNT pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621972>microRNA-29b inhibits cell growth and promotes sensitivity to oxaliplatin in  by targeting FOLR1.</a></h2><p>The present study was aimed to explore the functional role of microRNA (miR)-29b in , as well as underlying mechanisms. Expressions of miR-29b and folate receptor 1 (FOLR1) were measured in both human  tumor samples and cell lines.  cell lines SW480 and SW620 were transfected with miR-29b mimic, antisense oligonucleotides (ASO)-miR-29b, small interfering (siRNA) against FOLR1 (si-FOLR1), or corresponding negative controls (NCs), and then were incubated with or without oxaliplatin (L-OHP). Thereafter, cell viability, cytotoxicity, cell apoptosis, and expression of FOLR1, ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily G Member 2 (ABCG2) and p-glycoprotein (p-gp) were analyzed. We found that miR-29b was significantly decreased, while FOLR1 was statistically elevated in  samples and cell lines compared to the nontumor samples and nontumourigenic immortalized human  epithelial cell line FHC. Overexpression of miR-29b markedly inhibited cell viability, promoted sensitivity to L-OHP, stimulated cell apoptosis (all p < .05), and decreased the levels of ABCG2 and p-gp in  cells, whereas suppression of miR-29b showed contrary results. Moreover, we observed that FOLR1 was a direct target of miR-29b and was negatively regulated by miR-29b. In addition, the findings revealed that the effects of FOLR1 inhibition on cell viability, sensitivity to L-OHP, cell apoptosis, and the levels of ABCG2 and p-gp were similar to overexpression of miR-29b.

Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used to summarize information.Of 174 responses, 145 were complete and analyzed. Responses were obtained globally from South America (53%); the U.S. and Canada (28%); Europe, Australia, and New Zealand (12%); and Asia (7%). Most clinicians (98%) were aware of the IDEA study. Prior to IDEA, clinicians preferred FOLFOX over CAPOX (81% vs. 19%). Subsequent to IDEA, 55% of clinicians preferred CAPOX over FOLFOX (odds ratio, 5.0; 95% confidence interval, 3.0-8.5;  < .01 compared with pre-IDEA). Two thirds (68%) of responders tailored duration of adjuvant therapy based on risk stratification. Most oncologists (76%) were more willing to discontinue oxaliplatin early if toxicities develop after the results of IDEA. Half of responders (50%) found that IDEA increased their confidence in decision making for adjuvant treatment; 36% were unchanged, and 15% indicated decreased confidence. Less than half (48%) were comfortable communicating the study results and the concept of a noninferiority trial with patients.IDEA appears to have shifted clinician preference from FOLFOX to CAPOX for adjuvant therapy, and most clinicians now use a risk-stratified approach in determining duration of adjuvant therapy. Patient education resources may facilitate better communication of IDEA results to patients.This global survey illustrates that most gastrointestinal medical oncologists now use a risk-stratified approach for determining the duration of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III . Clinicians are five times more likely to choose CAPOX over FOLFOX after the International Duration Evaluation of Adjuvant Chemotherapy (IDEA) collaboration results.© AlphaMed Press 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645984>A new family with a homozygous nonsense variant in  further delineated the clinical phenotype of -associated polyposis.</a></h2><p>A new family with -associated polyposis (NAP) is described, involving a 58-year-old male affected with >100 colorectal polyps and a 55-year-old female sibling with nine colorectal polyps.

Acidophilus milk is a regular milk enriched with , one of the beneficial bacterial species found in the , that renders the product to exhibit an immunostimulant, anti-hypercholesterolemic, anti-inflammatory, or chemopreventive effect especially against ; in addition, for lactose intolerance treatment. However, most of bacterial species are very demanding and require specific nutritional and environmental conditions to survive. Probiotics suggested levels in fermented milk range from 10-10 colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL). The supplementation or fortification of acidophilus milk with different additives can improve not only the probiotics viability, nutritional value, and sensory properties but also its health benefits; this presents a strategy to improve its overall quality that has yet to be fully exploited by the dairy industry.

Genetic alterations in many NUP genes are associated with many human maladies, such as neurological disease, autoimmune disorders and .We reviewed the status quo of recent advancement of the knowledge of oncogenic role of nucleoporins in human carcinogenesis, focusing on major non-hematological malignancies in the recent literature. Both clinical study-derived and experiment-based reports were critically reviewed. We have also discussed the potential of nucleoporins as novel  biomarkers and promising therapeutic target against human malignancies.Several Nups such as Nup53, Nup88, Nup98, Nup160 and Nup214 modulated a plethora of cellular and physiological pathways involved in tumorigenesis such as GSK3β-Snail, Wnt/β-Catenin and RanGap1/RanBP2 signaling axes, DNA damage response, resistance to apoptosis and chemotherapy.Although classically, majority of studies have shown oncogenic roles of nucleoporins as genetic fusion partners in several types of leukemia, emerging evidence suggests that nucleoporins also modulate many cellular signaling pathways that are associated with several major non-hematological malignancies, such as carcinomas of skin, breast, lung, prostate and . Hence, nucleoporins are emerging as novel therapeutic targets in human tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623369>Differential Mechanism of ATP Production Occurs in Response to Succinylacetone in  Cells.</a></h2><p>Our aim was to verify the potential ability of succinylacetone (SA) to inhibit mitochondrial function, thereby suppressing  cell proliferation. SA treatment caused apoptosis in HCT116 and HT29 cells, but not in SW480 cells, with mitochondria playing a key role. We checked for dysfunctional mitochondria after SA treatment. Mitochondria of HT29 cells were swollen, indicating damage, whereas in HCT116 cells, several mitochondria had a diminished size. Damaged mitochondria decreased ATP production and induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cells. To understand SA-induced reduction in ATP production, we investigated the electron transfer chains (ETC) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) activity, which prevents the transfer of acetyl-CoA to the TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle by inhibiting PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase) activity. In each cell line, the inhibitory mechanism of ATP by SA was different. The activity of complex III consisting of the mitochondrial ETCs in HT29 cells was decreased. In contrast, PDH activity in HCT116 cells was reduced. Nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT)-removing reactive oxygen species (ROS) was upregulated in HT29 cells, but not in HCT116 cells, indicating that in HT29 cells, a defense mechanism was activated against ROS.

Recently, incidence rates of intestinal impairments have increased in East Asian countries due to changes of people's diet and life style. Therefore, the occurrence of these impairments needs to be prevented through dietary improvement and supplements containing GlcCer. The in vitro and in vivo effects of GlcCer on  impairment were explored in our previous studies, with focus on sphingolipid structure. Conversely, plant cell membrane contents such as GlcCer are known to be difficult to extract due to the thick cell wall. Therefore, human and other mammals may not be able to utilize GlcCer when digesting food of plant origin. To confirm this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of polished rice and the extract on intestinal impairment.

Flavokawain B is one of chalcones found in kava plant. In our studies, we focused on the anticancer activity of flavokawain B in colorectal  cells LoVo and its resistant to doxorubicin subline-LoVo/Dx. Strong cytotoxic activity of flavokawain B and its ability to inhibit the proliferation in both cell lines was detected. These effects accompanied with induction cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase and the presence of SubG1 fraction. Flavokawain B at low concentration led to increase of caspase-3 activity. The chalcone-induced apoptosis was also confirmed by DNA fragmentation. In our work, the conversion of flavokawain B to corresponding flavanone-5,7-dimetoxyflavanone-was shown to be more extensive in  than in non- cells. We found that the cyclization of the chalcone was related to the significant decrease in the cytotoxicity.

Transwell was used to examine the role of miR-708 and ZEB1 in invasion and migration. Western blot and qRT-PCR were conducted to determine the alteration of protein and miR-708 levels, respectively.MiR-708 was significantly downregulated in CRC tissues and cell lines. The restoration of the expression of miR-708 suppressed cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and reduced metastasis in CRC . Additionally, bioinformatics analysis predicted ZEB1 as a novel target gene of miR-708. Furthermore, ZEB1 was upregulated in CRC, which was negatively correlated with miR-708 expression.

As LCI does not decrease luminal brightness, it may improve the detection of . However, the extent to which LCI improves the visibility of  polyps has not yet been determined. Between December 2016 and May 2017, patients who received total colonoscopy were consecutively recruited into this retrospective, single-center study. For each polyp identified, images obtained from white light (WL) imaging, blue laser imaging (BLI), and LCI of the same lesion and its surrounding mucosa were evaluated. The color differences (ΔE) between each lesion and its surrounding mucosa in non-magnified images were computed quantitatively using the CIELAB color space, which defines color perception according to colorimetric values, and compared among WL, BLI, LCI, and chromoendoscopy. The ΔE between the vessel and non-vessel areas in magnified images was also assessed. Of the 64 patients who were incorporated into this study, non-magnified and magnified (×80) images from 113 and 95 polyps, respectively, were assessed. The ΔE was intensified by LCI and chromoendoscopy compared with WL and BLI. The ΔE of neoplastic lesions was also intensified by LCI. In magnified images, BLI and LCI significantly increased the ΔE between the vessel and non-vessel areas compared with WL. Luminal brightness, indicated by L*, was not impaired by LCI; however, was reduced by BLI compared with WL and LCI.

However, the safety of berberine in this population is not established. Individuals living in China with biopsy-proven UC, ≤ grade 2 dysplasia, and with a UC disease activity index (UCDAI) score ≤ 1 on mesalamine, were randomized 3:1 in a double-blind phase I trial to berberine 900 mg/day or placebo for 3 months, with the primary objective of assessing safety.

These include directional motility (including galvanotaxis), pH balance, extracellular proteolysis, and invasion. Contrary to the substantial in vitro data, however, evidence for VGSC involvement in the  process in vivo is limited. Here, we critically assess, for the first time, the available in vivo evidence, hierarchically from mRNA level to emerging clinical aspects, including protein-level studies, electrolyte content, animal tests, and clinical imaging. The evidence strongly suggests that different VGSC subtypes (mainly Nav1.5 and Nav1.7) are expressed de novo in human carcinoma tissues and generally parallel the situation in vitro. Consistent with this, tissue electrolyte (sodium) levels, quantified by clinical imaging, are significantly higher in  vs. matched non- tissues. These are early events in the acquisition of metastatic potential by the  cells. Taken together, the multi-faceted evidence suggests that the VGSC expression has clinical (diagnostic and therapeutic) potential as a prognostic marker, as well as an anti-metastatic target.

The distribution of Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Summary Stage for 12 malignancies was examined. We estimated net survival by stage up to 5 years after diagnosis, controlling for background mortality with life tables of all-cause mortality in the general population by single year of age, sex, and calendar period. Survival estimates were age-standardised using the International  Survival Standard (ICSS) weights.Only 14.2% of patients were diagnosed at a localised stage and 38.9% at the regional stage. The proportion of patients with known stage was 88.9% during 2000-2004 but fell to 59.4% during 2010-2013. During 2005-2009, 1- and 5-year survival for , rectal, breast, cervical, and prostate  was about 90% or higher for patients diagnosed at the localised stage. During 2004-2009, the proportion of patients diagnosed at a localised stage was lower in Kuwait than in the US for , breast, and lung . Age-standardised 5-year net survival for all stages combined was lower in Kuwait than the US for , lung, and breast , but stage-specific survival was similar.Since stage-specific survival is similar in Kuwait and the US, late stage at diagnosis is likely to be a major contributing factor to the overall lower survival in Kuwait than in the US. Increasing public awareness of  risk factors and symptoms and investment in early detection will be vital to reduce the proportion of patients diagnosed at a late stage and to improve survival.Copyright © 2019 E.

Today, MSI is usually detected by polymerase chain reaction amplification of specific microsatellite markers. However, the instability is identified by comparing the length of microsatellite repeats in tumor and normal samples. In this work, we developed a qualitative transcriptional signature to individually predict MSI status for right-sided  (RCC) based on tumor samples.Using RCC samples, based on the relative expression orderings (REOs) of gene pairs, we extracted a signature consisting of 10 gene pairs (10-GPS) to predict MSI status for RCC through a feature selection process. A sample is predicted as MSI when the gene expression orderings of at least 7 gene pairs vote for MSI; otherwise the microsatellite stability (MSS). The classification performance reached the largest F-score in the training dataset. This signature was verified in four independent datasets of RCCs with the F-scores of 1, 0.9630, 0.9412 and 0.8798, respectively. Additionally, the hierarchical clustering analyses and molecular features also supported the correctness of the reclassifications of the MSI status by 10-GPS.The qualitative transcriptional signature can be used to classify MSI status of RCC samples at the individualized level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658780> Infection and Colorectal Surgery: Is There Any Risk?</a></h2><p> infection (CDI) is an important healthcare-associated infection, with important consequences both from a medical and financial point of view, but its correlation with anastomotic leaks after colorectal surgeries is scarcely reported in the literature.  We conducted a retrospective study looking for patients who underwent open or laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancers between January 2012 and December 2017, excluding emergency surgeries for complicated colorectal tumors. We also examined patient history for risk factors for CDI such as age, sex, comorbidities, and clinical findings at admission or during hospital stay as well as tumor characteristics.  A total of 360 patients were included in the study, out of which 320 underwent surgeries that included anastomoses. There were 19 cases of anastomotic leaks, out of which 13 patients were diagnosed with CDI, with a statistic significance for association between CDI and anastomotic leakage ( < 0.0001). Most patients who developed both CDI and anastomotic leaks had left-sided resections or a type of rectal resection, while none of the patients with right-sided resections had this association, but with no statistical significance possibly due to the limited number of cases.  CDI is a relevant risk factor and should be taken into consideration when trying to prevent anastomotic leaks in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery for  or rectal . Thorough assessment of risk factors at admission should be mandatory in order to adequately prepare the patient and plan an optimal course of treatment. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and a multidisciplinary approach, with a team which should always include the surgeon, is mandatory when it comes to CDI prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630373>CDX2 Protein Expression in Colorectal  and ItsCorrelation with Clinical and Pathological Characteristics, Prognosis, and Survival Rate of Patients.</a></h2><p>Caudal-type homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2) is expressed in the nucleus of the intestinal epithelial cells and is essential for embryonic formation and differentiation of the intestine, whose reduced expression can result in metastatic tumors. This study was to investigate the association of CDX2 expression level in colorectal  (CRC) with age, gender, microscopic histopathology, tumor staging, tumor grading, 3-year survival rate, and prognosis.After preparing paraffin tissue blocks, CDX2 protein expression was assayed by immunohistochemistry in 82 CRC patients. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to detect tumor histology, tumor grading, tumor staging, and blood-lymphatic, and neural invasion. The collected data includes age, gender, tumor site, and 3-year survival rate of patients after diagnosis.The CDX2 expression was significantly higher in men than in women, and it was significantly lower in right-sided tumors as in transverse  and left-sided tumors. Also, the CDX2 expression was significantly higher in adenocarcinoma than in mucinous. In addition, a significant correlation was found between downregulated CDX2 and lymph node involvement. In tumor grading, there was a significant correlation between CDX2 downregulation and high-grade tumor. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between downregulated CDX2 expression and overall pathological staging.The downregulated CDX2 expression is associated with female gender, right-sided tumors, mucinous tumors, lymph node involvement, high-grade tumor, and advanced overall pathological staging and can be considered as a possible prognostic factor for patients follow-up. However, our study is a preliminary study and further studies with larger sample sizes in different ethnic groups are required.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651174>PLGA Nanoparticles Co-Delivering siRNAs against Programmed Cell Death Protein-1 and Its Ligand Gene for Suppression of  Tumor Growth.</a></h2><p>Tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes highly express programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) that interacts with its ligand, programmed cell death protein ligand-1 (PD-L1) on tumors. PD-1/PD-L1 interactions cause functional exhaustion of effector T cells and impair antitumor immunity, allowing tumors to escape immune surveillance. In addition to such extrinsic interactions, tumors proliferate by transmitting intrinsic PD-L1 signals via mTOR pathway. Here, we simultaneously silenced PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on CTLs and  tumors using PD-1 siRNA/PD-L1 siRNA-loaded PLGA nanoparticles and investigated functional activation of tumor-specific CTLs. When compared to a single PD-1 silencing on CTLs or a single PD-L1 silencing on tumors, co-silencing of PD-1/PD-L1 on CTLs and tumors more efficiently promoted effector functions of tumor-specific CTLs. Moreover, PD-L1-silenced tumors inhibited mTOR signaling and showed an antiproliferative response independently of adaptive immune response. Ultimately, systemic administration of PD-1 and PD-L1 siRNA via PLGA nanoparticles restored the effector functions of tumor-specific CTLs in MC38 tumor-bearing mice. Compared with antitumor effects of PD-1 or PD-L1 single silencing alone, co-silencing of PD-1 and PD-L1 showed more significant tumor growth suppression and long-term tumor inhibition in .

Therefore, these cells can be an appropriate target to improve  treatment.A novel biodegradable brush copolymeric micelle was synthesized by the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) and reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The obtained micelle was used for co-delivery of the anticancer drug docetaxel (DTX) and Chrysin (CHS) as an adjuvant on the CSCs originated from Human  adenocarcinoma cell line.  stem cells were enriched by MACS technique and characterized by flow cytometry analysis against CD133 marker.Data demonstrated that the micelles harbouring DTX@CHS had potential to reduce  stem cell viability compared to free DTX@CHS, single-drug formulations and the control group (p < 0.05). The combination effect of DTX and CHS formulated in micelle was synergistic in CSCs (CI < 1). The reactive oxygen species content was shown to increase after cell treatment with DTX@CHS loaded on micelles (p < 0.05). DTX@CHS-micelles inhibited  stem cell migration rate in vitro (p < 0.05), indicating an impaired metastasis activity.In conclusion, the synthesized DOX@CHS-micelles can be applied in the introduction of anticancer agents to resistant  population by further investigations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621322>Structurally Modified Cyclopenta[]benzofuran Analogues Isolated from .</a></h2><p>Four new cyclopenta[]benzofuran derivatives based on an unprecedented carbon skeleton (-), with a dihydrofuran ring fused to dioxanyl and aryl rings, along with a new structural analogue () of 5‴-episilvestrol (episilvestrol, ), were isolated from an aqueous extract of a large-scale re-collection of the roots of  collected in Vietnam.

Hypomagnesemia is a comparatively frequent adverse event of this drug, which is likely overlooked because it occurs later in treatment without symptoms. Furthermore, hypomagnesemia and hypomagnesemia-induced corrected QT (QTc) prolongation may lead to loss of consciousness (LOC), the onset of which is not generally considered associated with the treatment of anti-EGFR antibody because of its rare occurrence. Here, we present a colorectal  patient treated with anti-EGFR antibody, who suffered LOC during treatment while severe hypomagnesemia or QTc prolongation was not observed.A 69-year-old man with metastatic  was treated with cetuximab (anti-EGFR antibody) plus irinotecan as third-line chemotherapy. His serum magnesium level gradually decreased, and grade 2 hypomagnesemia (a serum magnesium level of 0.9 mg/dL) was observed at the 12th administration of cetuximab. In light of this development, intravenous supplementation of 20 mEq magnesium sulfate began with careful blood monitoring despite the lack of clinical symptoms. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed prolonged QT or corrected QT (QTc) intervals (grade 1). His serum magnesium level remained at 0.9 mg/dL, and no hypomagnesemia symptoms were observed by the 17th administration of cetuximab. After the treatment, however, he suddenly lost consciousness without symptoms related to infusion or allergic reactions. Circulatory collapse following dermatological reactions and respiratory events were not evident. Intravenous supplementation of magnesium sulfate was administered again. He awakened 2 min after the onset of temporary LOC without any other symptoms related to hypomagnesemia, such as lethargy, tremor, tetany, and seizures. No other etiology outside of the low level of serum magnesium was confirmed in further examinations. Cetuximab was discontinued, and his serum magnesium level returned to a level within the normal range after 6 weeks. Because of tumor progression, regorafenib and TAS-102 (trifluridine tipiracil hydrochloride) were introduced sequentially for 6 months. Five months after the final treatment of TAS-102, he died of his primary disease, which reflected a survival period of 4 years and 6 months since the beginning of treatment.This case report reminds clinicians that LOC can be induced without severe hypomagnesemia or QTc prolongation, during anti-EGFR antibody treatment for metastatic colorectal  even while under carefully monitored magnesium supplementation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636470>Role of ion channels in gastrointestinal .</a></h2><p>In their seminal papers Hanahan and Weinberg described oncogenic processes a normal cell undergoes to be transformed into a  cell. The functions of ion channels in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract influence a variety of cellular processes, many of which overlap with these hallmarks of . In this review we focus on the roles of the calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl) and zinc (Zn) transporters in GI , with a special emphasis on the roles of the KCNQ1 K channel and CFTR Cl channel in colorectal  (CRC). Ca is a ubiquitous second messenger, serving as a signaling molecule for a variety of cellular processes such as control of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and migration. Various members of the TRP superfamily, including TRPM8, TRPM7, TRPM6 and TRPM2, have been implicated in GI cancers, especially through overexpression in pancreatic adenocarcinomas and down-regulation in . Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are classically associated with the initiation and conduction of action potentials in electrically excitable cells such as neurons and muscle cells. The VGSC Na1.5 is abundantly expressed in human colorectal CRC cell lines as well as being highly expressed in primary CRC samples. Studies have demonstrated that conductance through Na1.5 contributes significantly to CRC cell invasiveness and  progression. Zn transporters of the ZIP/SLC39A and ZnT/SLC30A families are dysregulated in all major GI organ cancers, in particular, ZIP4 up-regulation in pancreatic  (PC). More than 70 K channel genes, clustered in four families, are found expressed in the GI tract, where they regulate a range of cellular processes, including gastrin secretion in the stomach and anion secretion and fluid balance in the intestinal tract. Several distinct types of K channels are found dysregulated in the GI tract. Notable are hERG1 upregulation in PC, gastric  (GC) and CRC, leading to enhanced  angiogenesis and invasion, and KCNQ1 down-regulation in CRC, where KCNQ1 expression is associated with enhanced disease-free survival in stage II, III, and IV disease. Cl channels are critical for a range of cellular and tissue processes in the GI tract, especially fluid balance in the . Most notable is CFTR, whose deficiency leads to mucus blockage, microbial dysbiosis and inflammation in the intestinal tract. CFTR is a tumor suppressor in several GI cancers. Cystic fibrosis patients are at a significant risk for CRC and low levels of CFTR expression are associated with poor overall disease-free survival in sporadic CRC. Two other classes of chloride channels that are dysregulated in GI cancers are the chloride intracellular channels (CLIC1, 3 & 4) and the chloride channel accessory proteins (CLCA1,2,4). CLIC1 & 4 are upregulated in PC, GC, gallbladder , and CRC, while the CLCA proteins have been reported to be down-regulated in CRC. In summary, it is clear, from the diverse influences of ion channels, that their aberrant expression and/or activity can contribute to malignant transformation and tumor progression. Further, because ion channels are often localized to the plasma membrane and subject to multiple layers of regulation, they represent promising clinical targets for therapeutic intervention including the repurposing of current drugs.©The Author(s) 2019.

A previous study focused on its antioxidant mechanism, whereas in this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of a series of 28 analogues and the mechanism of apoptosis of the most cytotoxic compound against wild-type (HCT-116) and p53 mutant (HT-29) colorectal  cell lines. The series of analogues comprise of different families, namely hydrazone, oxadiazole, thiosemicarbazides and triazoles. In the initial cytotoxicity screening, N-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzylidene)-4-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyloxy) benzohydrazide, henceforth known as, P5H, was found to be most cytotoxic against human colorectal  cell lines (IC for HCT-116 = 11.79 μM and HT-29 = 18.52 μM). Additionally, P5H was found to have some degree of selectivity towards  cells compared to normal human  cells (CCD-112 CoN). Subsequent investigation had brought insight on P5H ability to induce apoptosis in both HCT-116 and HT-29 cell lines. Cell cycle analysis showed both cell lines were arrested at the G2/M phase upon treatment.

A gene selection algorithm for  cancers is proposed by using the dynamic modeling properties of chameleon algorithm and its capability to discover any arbitrary shape clusters. This chameleon algorithm based gene selection algorithm comprises three steps. The first step is to select those genes with higher Fisher function values as candidate genes. The second step is to detect gene groups by using chameleon algorithm based on Euclidean distance. The third step is to select the most important gene from each gene cluster to comprise the gene subset by using the information index to classification of each gene. After that the chameleon algorithm is used to detect groups of  patients and normal people only with genes in gene subset. The final clustering accuracy of chameleon algorithm with the selected genes is up to 85.48%. The clustering analysis to  data and the comparisons to the other related studies demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective in detecting the differential genes of  cancers.© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617092>"Caudal-to-cranial" plus "artery first" technique with beyond D3 lymph node dissection on the right midline of the superior mesenteric artery for the treatment of right : is it more in line with the principle of oncology?</a></h2><p>To explore the feasibility and application value of a "caudal-to-cranial" plus "artery first" technique with beyond D3 lymph node dissection on the right midline of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) for the treatment of right  METHODS: Clinical data consisting of 168 right  cases under going laparoscopic D3 radical resection, including 84 cases of "caudal-to-cranial" plus "artery first" technique with beyond D3 lymph node dissection on the right midline of the SMA (CC + SMA group) and 84 cases of conventional medial approach plus dissection around the superior mesenteric vein (MA + SMV group), from January 2017 to March 2018 were retrospectively analyzed.

CCSCs as a result of accumulated genetic and epigenetic alterations and also complex interconnection with the tumor microenvironment (TME) can evolve and convert to full malignant cells. Mounting evidence suggests that in  therapy both CCSCs and non-CCSCs in TME have to be regarded to break through the limitation of current therapies. In this regard, stem cell capabilities of some non-CCSCs may arise inside the TME condition. Therefore, a deep knowledge of regulatory mechanisms, heterogeneity, specific markers, and signaling pathways of CCSCs and their interconnection with TME components is needed to improve the treatment of colorectal  and the patient's life quality. In this review, we address current different targeted therapeutic options that target cell surface markers and signaling pathways of CCSCs and other components of TME. Current challenges and future perspectives of  personalized therapy are also provided here.

To verify the in vivo data, the anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects of BE were determined with an in vitro cell model.HPLC analysis showed that BI was quickly transformed into BE by the intestinal microbiota. Oral BE (30 mg/kg/day) significantly increased the life span, from 125.2 to 218.4 days (P < 0.01%). BE treatment also decreased intestine index and increased spleen index.

This study was undertaken to explore the role and therapeutic potential of PPM1D in .HT-29  cell line was used in this study. Expression analysis of PPMD1 was performed by qRT-PCR. Cell viability was determined by CCK-8 assay. DAPI, acridin orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) and propidium iodide (PI)staining assays were used for apoptosis detection. Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry. Protein expression was determined by western blot analysis.The results showed that the expression of PPMD1 was significantly upregulated in  by 3.2 to 4.8 fold. Silencing of PPMD1 caused significant decline in the proliferation rate of the HT-29  cells that was due to induction of apoptosis as evidenced by DAPI, AO/EB and PI staining. Annexin V/PI showed a significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic of HT-29 cells upon silencing of PPMD1. The induction of apoptosis was also accompanied by increase in Bax and decrease in Bcl-2 expression. PPMD1 silencing also resulted in arrest of the HT-29 cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle which was also associated with upsurge of p21 and p53 and depletion of cyclin B1 expression levels. PPMD1 silencing also caused decrease in the viability of the HT-29 cells which was concomitant with suppression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression.These findings suggest that PPMD1 has oncogenic properties in  and exhibit therapeutic implications in  treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617091>Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) promotes cell proliferation in early-onset  tumorigenesis.</a></h2><p> (CC) is the third most commonly diagnosed  in the USA. While the overall incidence is declining, it is rising alarmingly in young patients (EOCC). CC in young patients tends to be more aggressive and often diagnosed at more advanced stages and portend poorer prognosis. Our recently published data showed that EOCC is a distinct disease with unique molecular features compared to late-onset CC (LOCC). The Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein (COMP) was shown to be significantly upregulated in EOCC and correlated with poor survival. However, the role of COMP in CC tumorigenesis, especially in young patients, is not well understood. Thus, the aim of this study was to elucidate the role of COMP in CC tumorigenesis by modulating COMP levels in vitro and test how it affects proliferation. Then, patient samples were evaluated by testing the levels of proliferation marker Ki67. In addition, this study investigates whether higher transcriptional mRNA levels of COMP seen in more aggressive early-onset CC correlate with protein levels compared to late-onset CC.COMP mRNA levels in fresh frozen  tumors (young: n = 5; old: n = 5) were assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Additionally, CC cell lines were profiled for COMP expression to choose an in vitro model to study the role of COMP in CC tumorigenesis. HT-29 (low COMP expression) and CaCo-2 (high COMP expression) cells were used for in vitro proliferation studies. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was conducted to assess COMP and Ki67 protein levels in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)  tumors.Significantly higher COMP expression levels were observed in fresh frozen EOCC compared to LOCC tumors. This observation confirmed our previously reported results from NanoString gene expression assay using FFPE samples. Cell proliferation was significantly increased in HT-29 and CaCo-2 cells upon treatment with human recombinant COMP protein after 48 and 72 h (P < 0.05). This increase was more profound in HT-29 cells. Staining for COMP and Ki67 revealed high COMP protein levels in EOCC compared to LOCC patients.COMP mRNA and protein levels are significantly higher in EOCC patients. Higher COMP levels correlate with increased proliferation suggesting a role in CC tumorigenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632588>TNF-α and IFN-γ synergistically inhibit the repairing ability of mesenchymal stem cells on mice colitis and .</a></h2><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be efficiently recruited to wound, inflammatory and tumor sites to repair and regenerate tissue. However, its role in colitis and colitis associated  is still controversial. This study was designed to evaluate the role and mechanisms of inflammatory cytokines-activated-MSCs in mice colitis and .We selected two well-characterized pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), to expand the inflammatory microenvironment of MSCs. The severity of colitis and  was evaluated by measuring  length, Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, Hematoxylin-eosin staining, Western Blot, Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence. These techniques were also performed to analyze the mechanisms of inflammatory cytokines-activated-MSCs in mice colitis and . Real-time PCR and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) were used to measure the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors.We found that the incubation of MSCs with TNF-α and IFN-γ aggravates colitis, where high levels of pro-inflammatory factors, such as interleukin (IL)-17, IL-8, IL-12, IL-1β, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, TNF-α and IFN-γ, were secreted. Furthermore, this phenomenon was associated with the activation of the nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-κB)/Signal transducer and activator of transcription three (STAT3) pathway. In addition, our study demonstrated that TNF-α and IFN-γ pretreated MSCs synergistically exacerbated mice , which was closely associated with angiogenesis.Taken together, these results indicate that TNF-α and IFN-γ pretreatment effectively inhibited the repair ability of MSCs and accelerated inflammation and tumor progression involving NF-κB/STAT3 pathway and angiogenesis-related factors.AJTR Copyright © 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661884>Fingerprinting, Antimicrobial, Antioxidant, Anticancer, Cyclooxygenase and Metabolic Enzymes Inhibitory Characteristic Evaluations of  Boiss.

The  EO was isolated and identified using microwave-ultrasonic and GC-MS techniques, respectively. Fifty-two compounds were identified, of which -borneol was the major component, followed by eucalyptol and epizonarene. The EO was evaluated against a panel of in-vitro bioassays. The EO displayed antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant  (MRSA),  and , with MIC values of 0.039, 0.078 and 0.78 mg/mL, respectively. The EO exhibited cytotoxicity against HeLa (cervical adenocarcinoma) and Colo-205 ()  cell lines with percentages of inhibition of 95% and 90%, for EO concentrations of 1.25 and 0.5 mg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, it showed metabolic enzyme (α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and lipase) inhibitory (IC = 45.22 ± 1.1, 63.09 ± 0.26, 501.18 ± 0.38 µg/mL, respectively) and antioxidant activity, with an IC value of 19.95 ± 2.08 µg/mL. Moreover, the  EO showed high cyclooxygenase inhibitory activity against COX-1 and COX-2 with IC values of 0.25 and 0.5 µg/mL, respectively, similar to those of the positive control (the NSAID etodolac). Outcomes amassed from this investigation illustrate that  EO represents a rich source of pharmacologically active molecules which can be further validated and explored clinically for its therapeutic potential and for the development and design of new natural therapeutic preparations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661890>Dimethylfumarate Inhibits Colorectal Carcinoma Cell Proliferation: Evidence for Cell Cycle Arrest, Apoptosis and Autophagy.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have proven that Dimethylfumarate (DMF) has a marked anti-proliferative impact on diverse  entities e.g., on malignant melanoma. To explore its anti-tumorigenic potential, we examined the effects of DMF on human  carcinoma cell lines and the underlying mechanisms of action. Human  cell line HT-29 and human colorectal carcinoma cell line T84 were treated with or without DMF. Effects of DMF on proliferation, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis were analyzed mainly by Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)- and Lactatdehydrogenase (LDH)assays, caspase activation, flowcytometry, immunofluorescence, and immunoblotting. In addition, combinational treatments with radiation and chemotherapy were performed. DMF inhibits cell proliferation in both cell lines. It was shown that DMF induces a cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase, which is accompanied by upregulation of p21 and downregulation of cyclin D1 and Cyclin dependent kinase (CDK)4. Furthermore, upregulation of autophagy associated proteins suggests that autophagy is involved. In addition, the activation of apoptotic markers provides evidence that apoptosis is involved. Our results show that DMF supports the action of oxaliplatin in a synergetic manner and failed synergy with radiation. We demonstrated that DMF has distinct antitumorigenic, cell dependent effects on  cells by arresting cell cycle in G0/G1 phase as well as activating both the autophagic and apoptotic pathways and synergizes with chemotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638265>BH3 profiling discriminates the anti‑apoptotic status of 5‑fluorouracil‑resistant  cells.</a></h2><p>5‑Fluorouracil (5‑FU) is a cytotoxic anticancer drug commonly used for patients with advanced . This drug effectively reduces the size of tumors to a certain degree; however,  cells can gradually acquire resistance, resulting in disease progression. To identify the mechanism of 5‑FU resistance, we established three 5‑FU‑resistant  cell lines and analyzed both apoptosis‑related protein expression levels and BH3 profiling. These 5‑FU‑resistant  cell lines acquired apoptotic resistance to 5‑FU. Although apoptosis‑related protein expression levels were altered in each 5‑FU‑resistant  cell line variably, BH3 profiling indicated BCLXL dependence in 5‑FU‑resistant HT‑29 cells only. Functional BCLXL inhibition in 5‑FU‑resistant HT‑29 cells not only sensitized the cells to apoptosis but also overcame 5‑FU resistance. The apoptotic BIM protein was preferentially sequestered, thereby resulting in acquired dependence on BCLXL for survival. Additionally, in vivo models showed that BCLXL inhibition controlled tumor progression. These results indicate that BH3 profiling facilitates the identification of the functional role of anti‑apoptotic proteins during drug resistance and has clinical implications for  in targeting specific proteins such as BCLXL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650683>Toll-like receptor 4 regulates spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis by up-regulating IL-6 and GM-CSF.</a></h2><p>Inflammation is as an important component of intestinal tumorigenesis. The activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signalling promotes inflammation in colitis of mice, but the role of TLR4 in intestinal tumorigenesis is not yet clear. About 80%-90% of colorectal tumours contain inactivating mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) tumour suppressor, and intestinal adenoma carcinogenesis in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is also closely related to the germline mutations in Apc. The Apc (multiple intestinal neoplasia) model mouse is a well-utilized model of FAP, an inherited form of intestinal . In this study, Apc intestinal adenoma mice were generated on TLR4-sufficient and TLR4-deficient backgrounds to investigate the carcinogenic effect of TLR4 in mouse gut by comparing mice survival, peripheral blood cells, bone marrow haematopoietic precursor cells and numbers of polyps in the guts of Apc WT and Apc TLR4 mice. The results revealed that TLR4 had a critical role in promoting spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis. Significant differential genes were screened out by the high-throughput RNA-Seq method. After combining these results with KEGG enrichment data, it was determined that TLR4 might promote intestinal tumorigenesis by activating cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and pathways in  signalling pathways. After a series of validation experiments for the concerned genes, it was found that IL6, GM-CSF (CSF2), IL11, CCL3, S100A8 and S100A9 were significantly decreased in gut tumours of Apc TLR4 mice compared with Apc WT mice. In the functional study of core down-regulation factors, it was found that IL6, GM-CSF, IL11, CCL3 and S100A8/9 increased the viability of  cell lines and decreased the apoptosis rate of  cells with irradiation and chemical treatment.© 2019 The Authors.

The downstream mechanisms of PDCD4 have been well-discussed, but its upstream regulators have not been systematically summarized. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are gene transcripts with no protein-coding potential but play a pivotal role in the regulation of the pathogenesis of solid tumors, cardiac injury, and inflamed tissue. In recent studies, many ncRNAs, especially microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), were found to interact with PDCD4 to manipulate its expression through transcriptional regulation and function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. For example, miR-21, as a classic oncogene, was identified as the key regulator of PDCD4 by targeting its 3'-untranslated region (UTR) to promote tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion in , breast, and bladder carcinoma. Therefore, we reviewed the recently emerging pleiotropic regulation of PDCD4 by ncRNAs in  and inflammatory disorders and aimed to shed light on the mechanisms of associated diseases, which could be conducive to the development of novel treatment strategies for PDCD4-induced diseases.Copyright © 2019 Zhao, Zhu, Hao, Song, Wang, Ni and Ding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646793>Zingiberene inhibits in vitro and in vivo human  cell growth via autophagy induction, suppression of PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway and caspase 2 deactivation.</a></h2><p> (CC) is one of the deadly malignancies and the second most frequent  in the world. The development of drug resistance and dearth of the viable drug options form a serious obstacle in the treatment of CC. Herein, the anticancer potential of Zingiberene was examined against the CC cells.The proliferation rate of the CC cells was assessed by cell counting assay. Autophagy was detected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The transfected cells were then treated with varied concentrations of Zingiberene (0, 10, 20 and 40 µM) for 24 h and monitored by fluorescent microscopy. Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry. Protein expression was determined by immunoblotting.Zingiberene could considerably inhibit the proliferation of CC cells. The anticancer activity of Zingiberene against the HT-29 CC cells was found to be due to induction of autophagy. The Zingiberene triggered autophagy was also linked with increase in the expression of LC3-II and decrease in p62 expression. However, no apparent effects were observed on the LC3-I expression. Moreover, it was found that zingiberine also caused activation of autophagy-related caspases in the HT-29 cells. Further, it was found that Zingiberene could inhibit the mTOR/PI3K/AKT signalling pathway in the CC cells. Zingiberene also suppressed the weight and volume of the xenografted tumors concentration-dependently.These results indicate that Zingiberene may inhibit the growth of CC in vitro and in vivo and may be used for the development of systemic therapy against CC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662792>Transcribed ultraconserved region (T-UCR) uc.261 expression is closely correlated with disease activity and intestinal permeability in Crohn's disease.</a></h2><p>Transcribed ultraconserved region (T-UCR) uc.261 is reported to participate in intestinal mucosa barrier damage in Crohn's disease (CD).

The specific function of this protein has not been fully elucidated, however, PLAC8 has been found to play an important tumor regulatory role in certain types of , including , pancreatic and liver . PLAC8 also participates in the regulation of the cell cycle, autophagy, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and other cellular functions, indicating its potential as a molecular target worth further investigation. The present study investigated the effect of PLAC8 on the proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma PC-9 cells and their sensitivity to gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). It was found that the inhibition of PLAC8 expression in PC-9 cells resulted in significantly decreased proliferation, whereas overexpression of PLAC8 significantly increased the proliferation (P<0.05) of PC-9 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of PLAC8 expression resulted in decreased activity of the ERK signaling pathway, while PLAC8 overexpression increased activity of this pathway. Inhibition of the ERK signaling pathway with U0126 reversed the effects induced by inhibiting or overexpressing PLAC8 on cell proliferation. In addition, overexpression of PLAC8 significantly decreased the sensitivity of PC-9 cells to gefitinib, and this effect was reversed by U0126. Overall, these results suggest that PLAC8 is involved in the regulation of proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma PC-9 cells and impacts their sensitivity to an EGFR-TKI. Thus, PLAC8 is a potential novel target in lung adenocarcinoma for future studies.Copyright © 2019, Spandidos Publications.</p></html>
