The primary structure of alligator substance P was established as: Arg-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Gln--Gly--Met-NH2. This sequence is the same as that of chicken substance P and shows one substitution (Arg for Lys3) as compared with mammalian substance P. The neurokinin A-like immunoreactivity was separated into two components. Neuropeptide gamma was the most abundant peptide and its primary structure was established as Asp-Ala-Gly-Tyr-Gly-Gln--Ser-His-Lys-Arg-His-Lys-Thr-Asp-Ser- Phe-Val-Gly--Met-NH2. This sequence shows one substitution (Tyr for His4) compared with mammalian neuropeptide gamma. The second component was identical to mammalian neurokinin A. A peptide with the chromatographic properties of mammalian neuropeptide K was not identified in the extract.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/47756>Large peptides of bovine and guinea pig myelin basic proteins produced by limited peptic hydrolysis.</a></h1><p>Bovine and guinea pig myelin basic proteins were cleaved with pepsin at pH 3.0 or pH 6.0 (enzyme/substrate, 1:500, w/w), and the peptides were isolated and identified. At pH 3.0 cleavage of the bovine protein occurred principally at three sites:  (88-89),  (42-43), and -Asp (36-37). Minor cleavages occurred at -Ser (110-111), Phe-Ser (113-114), and -Phe (152-153). A study of the time course of the hydrolysis showed that the reaction was biphasic; nearly all of the protein was cleaved at  (88-89) before significant cleavages at other sites occurred. At pH 6.0 cleavage of the bovine protein occurred almost exclusively at a single site, the  bond at position 88-89, resulting in bisection of the protein. Treatment of the guinea pig protein with pepsin under the same conditions resulted in the production of peptides which were identical with those of the bovine protein in chromatographic and electrophoretic properties and in N-terminal and C-terminal residues but which differed slightly in amino acid composition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2039477>Structure and receptor-binding activity of insulin from a holostean fish, the bowfin (Amia calva).</a></h1><p>The holostean fishes are the extant representatives of the primitive ray-finned fishes from which the present-day teleosts may have evolved. The primary structure of insulin from a holostean fish, the bowfin (Amia calva), was established as: A-chain: Gly--Val-Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys--Lys-Pro-Cys-Thr--Tyr-Glu-Met-Glu- Lys-Tyr-Cys-Asn B-chain: Ala-Ala-Ser-Gln-His--Cys-Gly-Ser-His--Val-Glu-Ala--Phe-- Val-Cys-Gly-Glu-Ser-Gly--Tyr-Asn-Pro-Asn-Lys-Ser This amino acid sequence contains several substitutions (methionine at A16, phenylalanine at B16 and serine at B22) at sites that have been strongly conserved in other vertebrate species and that may be expected to influence biological activity. Consistent with this prediction, bowfin insulin was approx. 14-fold less potent than pig insulin in inhibiting the binding of [125I-Tyr-A14](human insulin) to transfected mouse NIH 3T3 cells expressing the human insulin receptor.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19657833>Description of two new alpha variants: Hb Canuts [alpha85(F6)Asp-->His (alpha1)] and Hb Ambroise Pare [alpha117(GH5)Phe--> (alpha2)]; two new beta variants: Hb Beaujolais [beta84(EF8)Thr-->Asn] and Hb Monplaisir [beta147 (Tyr-Lys--Ala----Ser-Asn-Phe-Tyr-158-COOH)] and one new delta variant: Hb (A2)North Africa [delta59(E3)Lys-->Met].</a></h1><p>We present here five new hemoglobin (Hb) variants which have been identified during routine Hb analysis before their genotypic characterization. Four of these result from a classical missense mutation: Hb Canuts [alpha85(F6)Asp-->His (alpha1)], Hb Ambroise Pare [alpha117(GH5)Phe--> (alpha2)], Hb Beaujolais [beta84(EF8)Thr-->Asn] and HbA(2)-North Africa [delta59(E3)Lys-->Met]. The last one, Hb Monplaisir [beta147 (Tyr-Lys--Ala----Ser-Asn-Phe-Tyr-158-COOH)], results from a frameshift mutation at the stop codon of the beta-globin gene which leads to a modified C-terminal sequence in the beta-globin chain. None of these variants seem to have a particular clinical expression in the heterozygous state. The circumstances of the discovery of these five new Hb variants emphasize the fact that an association of techniques is necessary for a complete screening of Hb variants during routine Hb analysis. Globin chain separation by reversed phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC) appears to be the most relevant method.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21824815>Purification and characterization of a novel aspartic protease from basidiomycetous yeast Cryptococcus sp. S-2.</a></h1><p>An aspartic protease (Cap1) was purified from basidiomycetous yeast Cryptococcus sp. S-2 (FERM ABP-10961) using HiTrap DEAE FF column and HiTrap Q HP column chromatography with azocasein as a substrate. Cap1 has a molecular mass of 34 kDa on SDS-PAGE. It was stable up to 50°C with maximum activity at 30°C. Maximum proteolytic activity was observed at pH 5.0. Cap1 was stable in the pH range 3.0-7.0. Its enzyme activity was strongly inhibited by pepstatin A, an inhibitor of aspartic proteases, indicating that Cap1 is an aspartic protease. Cap1 hydrolyzed protein substrates, including BSA, hemoglobin, α-casein, β-casein, and κ-casein. It showed activity on synthetic substrates, such as MOCAc-Gly-Lys-Pro----Arg--Lys(Dnp)-D-Arg-NH₂ and MOCAc-Ala-Pro-Ala-Lys--Arg--Lys(Dnp)-NH₂. Hydrolysis of the oxidized insulin B chain followed by amino acid sequencing analysis of the cleavage products revealed that 9 of its 30 peptide bonds were hydrolyzed by Cap1. This result was similar to that observed with pig pepsin A and human pepsin A. Cap1 also exhibited milk-clotting activity. We cloned the cDNA of CAP1 gene, which contained a 1254 bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 417 amino acid residues. Homology search in the NCBI database revealed that the amino acid sequence of Cap1 showed less than 39% identity to other known proteins. Therefore, we proposed that Cap1 is a novel aspartic protease.Copyright © 2011 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Steady-state and transient kinetic measurements, assisted by computer simulation of the time and Ca(2+) dependences of the phosphorylation level, were used to study the partial reaction steps of the enzyme cycle, including the binding and dissociation of Ca(2+) at the high affinity cytoplasmically facing sites. The mutation Lys--Asp-Glu(255) --> Glu--Glu-His resulted in a conspicuous increase in the rate of Ca(2+) dissociation as well as a displacement of the major conformational equilibria of the phosphoenzyme and dephosphoenzyme forms. The point mutant Phe(256) --> Ala also showed an increased rate of Ca(2+) dissociation, whereas a conspicuous decrease both in the rate of Ca(2+) dissociation and in the rate of Ca(2+) binding was found for the mutant Gly-Glu-Gln-(260) --> -His--. These findings suggest that the NH(2)-terminal half of M3 is involved in control of the gateway to the Ca(2+) sites. The main effect of two mutations to the COOH-terminal half of M3, Ser-Lys-Val--Ser(265) --> Thr-Gly-Val-Ala-Val and --Cys-Val-Ala-Val-Trp--(274) --> Phe--Gly-Val-Ser---, was a block of the dephosphorylation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8008623>[D-Leu2]deltorphin, a 17 amino acid opioid peptide from the skin of the Brazilian hylid frog, Phyllomedusa burmeisteri.</a></h1><p>A novel 17 amino acid peptide, having a D-leucine in position 2 of its sequence, has been isolated from methanol extracts of the skin of the Brazilian frog, Phyllomedusa burmeisteri. The sequence of the peptide is: Tyr-D--Phe-Ala-Asp-Val-Ser-Thr--Gly-Asp--His-Ser--NH2. It displays a poor affinity for delta-opioid binding sites, both in the periphery and in the central nervous system. However, the shorter synthetic amidated analogue (1-10) possess both on the central and peripheral delta binding sites an agonistic potency equalling in affinity and exceeding in selectivity that of the enkephalins. The shorter amidated analogue (1-7) is virtually inactive on opioid binding sites in the periphery, but displays a clear-cut affinity for both delta and mu binding sites on rat brain membranes. To date six different D-amino acid residues have been found, always in position 2 of the sequence, in as many as 11 natural peptide molecules of animal origin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17521331>A new approach for distinguishing cathepsin E and D activity in antigen-processing organelles.</a></h1><p>Cathepsin E (CatE) and D (CatD) are the major aspartic proteinases in the endolysosomal pathway. They have similar specificity and therefore it is difficult to distinguish between them, as known substrates are not exclusively specific for one or the other. In this paper we present a substrate-based assay, which is highly relevant for immunological investigations because it detects both CatE and CatD in antigen-processing organelles. Therefore it could be used to study the involvement of these proteinases in protein degradation and the processing of invariant chain. An assay combining a new monospecific CatE antibody and the substrate, MOCAc-Gly-Lys-Pro----Arg--Lys(Dnp)-D-Arg-NH2[where MOCAc is (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl and Dnp is dinitrophenyl], is presented. This substrate is digested by both proteinases and therefore can be used to detect total aspartic proteinase activity in biological samples. After depletion of CatE by immunoprecipitation, the remaining activity is due to CatD, and the decrease in activity can be assigned to CatE. The activity of CatE and CatD in cytosolic, endosomal and lysosomal fractions of B cells, dendritic cells and human keratinocytes was determined. The data clearly indicate that CatE activity is mainly located in endosomal compartments, and that of CatD in lysosomal compartments. Hence this assay can also be used to characterize subcellular fractions using CatE as an endosomal marker, whereas CatD is a well-known lysosomal marker. The highest total aspartic proteinase activity was detected in dendritic cells, and the lowest in B cells. The assay presented exhibits a lower detection limit than common antibody-based methods without lacking the specificity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11566257>The cell envelope-bound metalloprotease (camelysin) from Bacillus cereus is a possible pathogenic factor.</a></h1><p>A novel membrane proteinase of the nosocomial important bacteria species Bacillus cereus (synonyms: camelysin, CCMP) was purified up to homogeneity as was shown by mass spectrometry in its amphiphilic form. Camelysin is a neutral metalloprotease with a molecular mass of 19 kDa. Its unique N-terminus -Ser-Asp-Lys-Glu-Val-Ser-Asn-Asn-Thr-Phe-Ala-Ala-Gly-Thr--Asp--Thr--Asn-Pro-Lys-Thr--Val-Asp-(-Lys-Asp)- was not detected in the protein data bases during BLAST searches, but in the partially sequenced genome of Bacillus anthracis, coding for an unknown protein. Cleavage sites of the membrane proteinase for the insulin A- and B-chains were determined by mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing. Camelysin prefers cleavage sites in front of aliphatic and hydrophilic amino acid residues (-OH, -SO3H, amido group), avoiding bulky aromatic residues. The internally quenched fluorogenic substrates of the matrix metalloproteases 2 and 7 were cleaved with the highest efficiency at the -decrease-Gly or -decrease-Ala bond with the smaller residue in the P1' position. The protein specificity is broad--all various kinds of casein were cleaved as well as acid-soluble collagen, globin and ovalbumin; intact insulin was destroyed only to a low extent. Actin, collagen type I, fibrinogen, fibrin, alpha2-antiplasmin and alpha1-antitrypsin were cleaved. The protease formed SDS-stable complexes with Glu-plasminogen and antithrombin III, visible after SDS electrophoresis by gold staining and Western blot. The CCMP-plasminogen complex caused a partial activation of plasminogen to plasmin. Camelysin interacts with proteins of the blood coagulation cascade and could facilitate the penetration of fibrin clots and of the extracellular matrix during bacterial invasion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9446726>Purification and structural characterization of insulin and glucagon from the bichir Polypterus senegalis (Actinopterygii: Polypteriformes).</a></h1><p>The Polypteriformes (bichirs and reedfish) are a family of ray-finned fishes of ancient lineage. Insulin has been isolated from an extract of the pancreas and upper gastrointestinal tract of the bichir Polypterus senegalis and its primary structure established as A-chain: Gly--Val-Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys-Asp-Thr-Pro10-Cys-Ser- -Tyr-Asp--Glu-Asn-Tyr-Cys20-Asn: B-chain: Ala-Ala-Asn-Arg-His--Cys-Gly-Ser-His10--Val- Glu-Ala--Tyr--Val-Cys-Gly20-Asn-Arg-Gly-Phe- Phe-Tyr--Pro-Ser-Lys30-Met. Despite the fact that Polypterus insulin contains several unusual structural features that are not found in insulins from other jawed fish (Asp at A-8, Thr at A-9, Arg at B-4, Asn at B-21,  at B-27, Met at B-31), all the residues in human insulin that are involved in receptor binding, dimerization, and hexamerization have been conserved. A comparison of the structures of insulins from a range of species indicates that Polypterus insulin most closely resembles paddlefish insulin II (seven amino acid substitutions). In contrast, Polypterus glucagon (His-Ser- Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Asn-Asp-Tyr10-Thr-Lys-Tyr- Gln-Asp-Ser-Arg-Arg-Ala-Gln20-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln- Trp--Met-Ser-Asn) most closely resembles the glucagons from the gar Lepisosteus spatula and the bowfin Amia calva (four amino acid substitutions). The data are consistent with the conclusion based on comparison of morphological characteristics that the Polypterids are the most basal living group of the Actinopterygians with evolutionary connections to both the Acipenserids and the Neopterygians.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9204362>Purification and structural characterization of insulin from the lesser siren, Siren intermedia (Amphibia: Caudata).</a></h1><p>Insulin has been isolated from an extract of the pancreas of a salamander, the lesser siren Siren intermedia, and its primary structure was established as: A-chain, Gly--Val- Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys-His-Asn-Thr10-Cys-Ser--Tyr-Gln--Glu-Asn-Tyr- Cys20-Asn, and B-chain, Val-Pro-Asn-Lys-Pro- -Cys-Gly-Ala-His10--Val-Glu-Val-Met-Tyr-Phe-Val- Cys-Gly20-Asp-Arg-Gly--Tyr-Pro-Ser-Ser-Thr 30. Although those amino acid residues considered to constitute the receptor-binding region of insulin have been retained, siren insulin contains several substitutions (Gln-->Lys at B4, Ser-->Ala at B9, Ala-->Val at B14, -->Met at B15, -->Phe at B17, Pro-->Ser at B28, and Lys-->Ser at B29) of amino acid residues that are conserved in insulins from species of other amphibian orders. The biological activity of siren insulin was not investigated in this study but the substitutions at B28 (involved in dimer formation) and at B14 and B17 (involved in hexamer formation) may be expected to influence conformation and therefore biological potency. The data are consistent with the view that the Sirenoidea represent an early divergence from the ancestral stock of salamanders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9650713>Isolation and characterization of insulin in Russian sturgeon (Acipenser guldenstaedti).</a></h1><p>Insulin was isolated from the pancreas of Chondrostean fish, the Russian sturgeon, Acipenser guldenstaedti, by acid-ethanol extraction followed by ion-exchange and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographies. The amino acid sequence determined by automated Edman degradation is as follows: A-chain (21-amino-acid peptide), H-Gly--Val-Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys-His-Ser-Pro-Cys-Ser--Tyr-Asp--Glu-As n-Tyr-Cys-Asn-OH; and B-chain (31-amino-acid peptide), H-Ala-Ala-Asn-Gln-His--Cys-Gly-Ser-His--Val-Glu-Ala--Tyr--Va l-Cys-Gly-Glu-Arg-Gly--Tyr-Thr-Pro-Asn-Lys-Val-OH. The sturgeon insulin appears to be identical with one of two forms of paddlefish insulin and differs from the other form by a single substitution in the A-chain, Asp15: His15. The amino acid sequence of sturgeon insulin is more similar to the amino acid sequence of mammalian insulins than of other fish insulins. Sturgeon insulin showed parallel but weaker displacement than porcine insulin and pink salmon insulin in their respective radioimmunoassays and was less potent than porcine insulin in displacing radiolabeled porcine insulin bound to partially purified rat liver plasma membranes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9866861>Carboxypeptidase A-catalyzed dipeptide synthesis in organic media.</a></h1><p>The carboxypeptidase A-catalyzed syntheses of dipeptides from L-amino acids (Phe, Tyr, Trp,  and ) were studied in various water-miscible (acetone, acetonitrile, ethanol, methanol and 1,4-dioxane) organic solvents. The highest yield (43%) was achieved in acetonitrile with L-Phe as substrate, after a 24-h incubation. The optimal conditions of  synthesis in acetonitrile were determined.

The enzyme from Streptococcus thermophilus IAM10064 was more thermostable than that from Streptococcus lactis IAM1198 which contained the enzyme most abundantly among the lactic acid bacteria we examined here. We purified the enzyme about 3400-fold to homogeneity from cell-free extract of S. thermophilus, which is composed of two identical subunits with a molecular weight of 28,000 as a homodimer. The enzyme utilizes specifically aspartate as a substrate, but not alanine and glutamate. Maximal reaction velocity was observed at 37 degrees C and around pH 8.0. The sequence of the NH2-terminal amino acids of the enzyme was determined to be Met-Glu-Asn--Ser---Gly-XXX-Met-Gly-Thr-Met-Ala-Thr-Glu-Ser- Phe-.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10348917>Characterization of new fluorogenic substrates for the rapid and sensitive assay of cathepsin E and cathepsin D.</a></h1><p>Cathepsin E and cathepsin D are two major intracellular aspartic proteinases implicated in the physiological and pathological degradation of intra- and extracellular proteins. In this study, we designed and constructed highly sensitive synthetic decapeptide substrates for assays of cathepsins E and D based on the known sequence specificities of their cleavage sites. These substrates contain a highly fluorescent (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl (MOCAc) moiety and a quenching 2,4-dinitrophenyl (Dnp) group. When the  bond is cleaved, the fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 328 nm and emission wavelength of 393 increases due to diminished quenching resulting from the separation of the fluorescent and quenching moieties. The first substrate, MOCAc-Gly-Lys-Pro----Arg-Le u-Lys(Dnp)gamma-NH2, in which the Lys-Pro combination at positions P5 and P4 was designed for specific interaction with cathepsin E, is hydrolyzed equally well by cathepsins E and D (kcat/Km = 10.9 microM(-1) x s(-1) for cathepsin E and 15.6 microM(-1) x s(-1) for cathepsin D). A very acidic pH optimum o was obtained for both enzymes. The second substrate, MOCAc-Gly-Lys-Pro----Arg-Le u-Lys(Dnp)gamma-NH2, in which the isoleucine residue at position P2 was meant to increase the specificity for cathepsin E, is also hydrolyzed equally by both enzymes (kcat/Km = 12.2 microM(-1) x s(-1) for cathepsin E and 16.3 microM(-1) x s(-1) for cathepsin D). The kcat/Km values for both substrates are greater than those for the best substrates for cathepsins E and D described so far. Unfortunately, each substrate shows little discrimination between cathepsin E and cathepsin D, suggesting that amino acids at positions far from the cleavage site are important for discrimination between the two enzymes. However, in combination with aspartic proteinase inhibitors, such as pepstatin A and Ascaris pepsin inhibitor, these substrates enable a rapid and sensitive determination of the precise levels of cathepsins E and D in crude cell extracts of various tissues and cells. Thus these substrates represent a potentially valuable tool for routine assays and for mechanistic studies on cathepsins E and D.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8546696>Characterization of an insulin from the three-toed amphiuma (Amphibia: Urodela) with an N-terminally extended A-chain and high receptor-binding affinity.</a></h1><p>Insulin was isolated from an extract of the pancreas of a urodele, the three-toed amphiuma (Amphiuma tridactylum), and its primary structure established as Ala-Arg-Gly--Val-Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys-His10-Asn-Thr-Cys- Ser--Asn-Gln--Glu-Asn20-Tyr-Cys-Asn for the A-chain and -Thr-Asn-Gln-Tyr--Cys-Gly-Ser-His10--Val-Glu-Ala- -Tyr--Val-Cys-Gly20-Asp-Arg-Gly--Tyr-Ser-Pro-Lys for the B-chain. The N-terminus of the A-chain is extended by two amino acids (Ala-Arg) relative to all other known insulins suggesting an anomalous pathway of post-translational processing in the region of the C-peptide/A-chain junction of proinsulin. In common with chicken and Xenopus insulins, which contain a HisA8, amphiuma insulin was more potent (approx. 5-fold) than porcine insulin in inhibiting the binding of [125I-TyrA14]insulin to the soluble human insulin receptor from transfected 293EBNA cells (an adenovirus-transformed human kidney cell line). This result is consistent with previous data showing that insulin analogues extended at GlyA1 by uncharged groups have reduced binding affinity whereas high affinity is preserved in analogues extended by basic amino acid residues.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9090119>Purification and characterization of arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase from cockroach testicular organs.</a></h1><p>Arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT; EC2.3.1.87) catalyzes N-acetylation of various arylalkylamines using acetyl-CoA as a donor substrate. A type of NAT was purified 2700-fold from 451 pairs of cockroach testicular organs consisting of testis and its accessory gland. The NAT activity was recovered as a single peak on any column chromatography examined, suggesting that the testicular organ contained only one form of NAT. Five steps of successive column chromatographies gave a single protein band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with estimated molecular mass of 28 kDa. The molecular mass of the native enzyme was also determined to be approximately 30 kDa by molecular sieve chromatography, indicating that the enzyme is a monomer protein. The enzyme acted on various arylalkylamines such as tryptamine, serotonin, dopamine, octopamine, norepinephrine, tyramine and methoxytryptamine, with K(m) values ranging from 20 to 50 microM. The optimum pH for these substrates was around 6.0. Internal amino acid sequences derived from two proteolytic fragments of the enzyme were determined as --Gly-Glu-Asn-Gly-Asp-Glu and -Phe--Glu-Glu-Pro--Asn--Ser--Gln, both of which exhibited significant homology to the C-terminal sequence of known vertebrate NATs; however, homology was less than 45%. These results suggest that a unique NAT is present in the cockroach testicular organ at high levels, and likely plays a role in the regulation of testicular function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12578561>Specificity of S'1 and S'2 subsites of human tissue kallikrein using the reactive-centre loop of kallistatin: the importance of P'1 and P'2 positions in design of inhibitors.</a></h1><p>We have demonstrated that the S'(1) and S'(2) subsites of human tissue kallikrein (hK1) play determinant roles in the recognition and hydrolysis of substrates. The presence of serine at position P'(1) and arginine at P'(2) resulted in the best substrate, Abz-Ala--Lys--Ser-Arg-Gln-EDDnp, which was derived from the kallistatin reactive-centre loop sequence and quencher groups o-aminobenzoic acid (Abz) and N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)ethylenediamine (EDDnp). Serine and arginine are also the residues at positions P'(1) and P'(2) in human kininogen, from which hK1 releases Lys-bradykinin. Several peptide analogues of Abz-Ala--Lys--Ser-Arg-Gln-EDDnp, in which the Ser and Arg residues were substituted with various other amino acids, were synthesized and tested as substrates. Most of them were hydrolysed slowly, although they showed significant binding to hK1, as demonstrated by their competitive inhibition constants (K(i)). Using this information, six peptides were designed, synthesized and assayed as inhibitors of hK1. Abz-Lys--Pro-Arg-Gln-EDDnp, Abz-Lys-Phe-Arg-Pro-Arg-Gln-EDDnp and acetyl-Lys--Pro--Glu-NH(2) inhibited hK1 in the range 20-30 nM (letters in italics denote the D-form of the amino acid). The peptide acetyl-Lys--Pro--Glu-NH(2) was a weak inhibitor for other serine proteases, as indicated by the higher K (i) values compared with hK1, but this peptide was a potent inhibitor of human plasma kallikrein, which has a K (i) value of 8 nM. This result was surprising, since this enzyme is known to be a restricted arginyl-hydrolase. In conclusion, acetyl-Lys--Pro--Glu-NH(2) can be used as a leader compound to design specific inhibitors for hK1, plasma kallikrein, or for both at same time, if the inhibition of kinin release is the main goal.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8810516>Purification and characterization of an extracellular aspartate protease from Phycomyces blakesleeanus.</a></h1><p>An acid protease has been found in the culture broth of Phycomyces blakesleeanus growing under standard conditions. It has been induced up to 70-fold with several complex growth media and the enzyme has been purified to homogeneity and characterized. The molecular mass of the native enzyme was estimated by gel filtration to be 40 kDa. The acid protease of Phycomyces migrated as a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, corresponding to a molecular mass of 35 kDa. The glycoprotein nature for the acid protease was deduced from its binding to a concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B column. The carbohydrate moiety is composed of mannose and rhamnose. Its amino acid composition was determined, and its isoelectric point was estimated to be 4.2, the optimum pH was 2.5 to 3, and the optimum temperature was 70 degrees C, using hemoglobin as a substrate. The enzyme showed thermal stability between 37 and 50 degrees C. The thermodynamic parameters for hemoglobin hydrolysis and thermal inactivation were calculated. With Lys-Pro--Glu-(4-N02)-Arg- as the substrate, the Km, kcat, and Vmax values were 8.78 microM, 1.25 s(-1), and 2.12 mumol min(-1) mg(-1), respectively. The protease was insensitive to phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, O-phenanthroline, N-ethylmaleimide, iodoacetamide, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, [ethyl-enebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid, and trypsin inhibitor. However, pepstatin A established a strong competitive inhibition against it, with a K(i) value of 1.33 nM. The data suggest that this protease has properties of an aspartate-type proteinase.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29367161>Cathepsin D immobilized capillary reactors for on-flow screening assays.</a></h1><p>The treatment of diseases using enzymes as targets has called for the development of new and reliable methods for screening. The protease cathepsin D is one such target involved in several diseases such as tumors, degenerative processes, and vital processes of parasites causing schistosomiasis. Herein, we describe the preparation of a fused silica capillary, cathepsin D (CatD)-immobilized enzyme reactor (IMER) using in a multidimensional High Performance Liquid Chromatography-based method (2D-HPLC) and zonal affinity chromatography as an alternative in the search for new ligands. The activity and kinetic parameters of CatD-IMER were evaluated by monitoring the product MOCAc-Gly-Lys-Pro---Phe (P-MOCAc) (K = 81.9 ± 7.49 μmol/L) generated by cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate MOCAc-Gly-Lys-Pro----Arg--Lys(DNP)-d-Arg-NH2 (S-MOCAc). Stability studies have indicated that CatD-IMER retained 20% of activity after 5 months, a relevant result, because proteases are susceptible to autoproteolysis in solution assays with free enzyme. In the search for inhibitors, 12 crude natural product extracts were analyzed using CatD-IMER as the target, resulting in the isolation of different classes of natural products.

IPE and RPE cells were isolated from Long Evans rat eyes. The origin of the isolated cells was determined by pigmentation and cytokeratin labelling. The mRNA expressions of cat D and cat S in cultured IPE or RPE cells were investigated by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Enzyme activities of cat D and cat S in IPE or RPE cells were measured by using specific fluorogenic substrates, MOCAc-Gly-Lys-Pro----Arg--Lys-(Dnp)D-Arg-NH2 and Z-Val-Val-Arg-MCA, respectively. Western blot analysis of both proteins was also performed. The cultured cells, both of IPE and RPE cells were pigmented and showed positive labelling with an anti-cytokeratin monoclonal antibody. The cat D activity in RPE cells was 37 times that in IPE cells. The cat S activity in RPE cells was four times that in IPE cells. On the other hand, mRNA expression levels of cat D in RPE cells were at the same level with IPE cells, cat S mRNA expression in RPE cells were 10 times that in IPE cells. These results were also correlated with the Western blot analysis. In this study, we measured the characteristic expressions of cat D and S in IPE and RPE cells for the first time to compare their lysosomal activities. IPE cells have the lysosomal activities like RPE cells, however, the function of lysosomal activity in IPE cells is beneath RPE's. These results indicated that the ability of ROS digestion in IPE cells was not same as RPE cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10525356>Purification and characterization of insulin from the Australian lungfish, Neoceratodus forsteri (Dipnoi).</a></h1><p>The Australian lungfish Neoceratodus forsteri, a facultative air breather, is considered to be the most primitive of the extant Dipnoi and so occupies a uniquely important evolutionary position in the transition from fish to tetrapods. Insulin was isolated from an extract of the pancreas of N. forsteri and its primary structure established as: A-Chain, Gly--Val-Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys-His-Thr-Pro(10)-Cys-Ser--Tyr-Gln--G lu-Asn-Tyr-Cys(20)-Asn-Glu-Thr-Glu; B-Chain, Ala-Ala-Val-Asn-Gln-His--Cys-Gly-Ser(10)-His--Val-Glu-Ala-- Tyr-Phe-Val-Cys(20)-Gly-Glu-Arg-Gly--Tyr--Pro- Lys(30)-Gly. This amino acid sequence is more similar to that of human insulin than to insulins from present-day amphibians. All the residues in human insulin that are considered to be important in receptor binding, dimerization, and hexamerization are conserved in lungfish insulin except for the substitution ( --> Phe) at the position corresponding to B17 in human insulin. Consistent with the assertion that the Dipnoi is a monophyletic group, insulins from N. forsteri and from the African lungfish Protopterus annectens contain extensions to the C-terminus of the A-chain and to the N-terminus of the B-chain that have not been found in other sarcopterygian species. However, the unusual amino acid substitutions found in insulin from P. annectens (e.g., GlyB21 --> Ala, GluB22 --> Asp, and ArgB23 --> Asn) are not present in N. forsteri insulin, suggesting that they occurred in the Protopterus lineage after divergence of the genera.Copyright 1999 Academic Press.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8759334>A comparison of the positive- and negative-ion mass spectra of bio-active peptides from the dorsal secretion of the Australian red tree frog, Litoria rubella.</a></h1><p>The collision-induced tandem mass spectral data for MH+ and [M-H]- ions from six bio-active peptides from Litoria rubella are compared. Backbone cleavages of [M-H]- ions provide sequencing information for five of the peptides [e.g. Phe Pro Trp  (NH2) and pGlu Phe Pro Trp  (NH2)] and in these cases, the negative-ion spectra are as informative as the positive-ion spectra. Side-chain cleavages are also noted in these spectra. For example, (i) when Trp is present, the loss of C9H7N (129 u) competes with the backbone cleavages, and (ii) the [M-H]- ion of  Glu  Thr (NH2) undergoes facile side-chain fragmentation [loss of H2O (from Glu) and MeCHO (from Thr)], but does not form any conventional backbone-cleavage ions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3110143>Identification of a lysyl residue in antithrombin which is essential for heparin binding.</a></h1><p>Identification of lysyl residue(s) in human plasma antithrombin required for binding of heparin was approached using chemical modification with the amino-group reagent pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Modification of antithrombin with limiting amounts of reagent yields an average incorporation of the phosphopyridoxyl label into 1 lysine/protein molecule (Pecon, J. M., and Blackburn, M. N. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 935-938). Fractionation of the labeled antithrombin by affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose separated a phosphopyridoxylated antithrombin species devoid of heparin binding from modified protein which retained affinity for heparin. To generate peptide maps of the two antithrombin species, the proteins were reductively denatured, S-carboxymethylated, and digested with trypsin. Fractionation of the tryptic digests by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography indicated one peak in the chromatogram of the non-heparin-binding species to be clearly different when compared to the chromatogram of the heparin-binding species. The sequence of the unique peptide, determined by automated Edman degradation, was Thr-Ser-Asp-Gln--His--Phe-Ala-Lys--Asn-Cys-Arg. This peptide corresponds to a tryptic fragment including residues 115-129 in the sequence of antithrombin, with the modified residue identified as Lys-125. Additionally, phosphopyridoxylation of antithrombin in the presence of added heparin indicated that several other lysyl residues were "protected" from modification. Identification of this critical lysine for heparin binding strongly supports previous data which indicate that the heparin-binding domain of antithrombin is located at the NH2 terminus within one of the disulfide cross-linked loops of the protein.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5158504>-Crystallin. Fractionation of subunits and sequence studies on an isolated polypeptide.</a></h1><p>alpha-Crystallin was carboxymethylated with radioactive iodoacetic acid in the presence of 7.6m-urea and then separated into six major fractions by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose in 7m-urea. Based on the amino acid compositions, specific radioactivities and sodium dodecyl sulphate-gel electrophoresis of the fractions, it was concluded that alpha-crystallin contains at least four different subunits: DU1A and DU1B, containing no cysteine; a third component represented by DU2B and DU3 containing one cysteine one cysteine residue per subunit; and DU4, which probably contains two residues of cysteine per subunit. Subunit DU1A was shown to be of sufficient purity for sequence studies. Cyanogen bromide cleavage yielded two peptides, CB-1 and CB-2, in approximately equal amounts as expected. The sum of the molecular weights and amino acid compositions of the peptides were both in excellent agreement with the results obtained for subunit DU1A. The amino acid sequence of the first sixteen residues of peptide CB-1 is: Ser--Thr-Lys-Asp-Phe-Asp-Glu-Val-Asn--Asp-Val-Ser-His-Phe-. The sequence of the first seventeen residues of peptide CB-2 is: Asp--Ala--Ser-His-Pro-Trp--Arg-Pro-Ser--Glu-Phe-His-. The N-terminal sequence of subunit DU1A was shown to be N-acetylmethionine followed by peptide CB-2.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15294281>Purification and characterization of recombinant human cathepsin E expressed in human kidney cell line 293.</a></h1><p>A cDNA encoding human prepro-cathepsin E was introduced into the adenovirus-transformed HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) cell line. The construct contained both a V5 peptide epitope and histidine tags at the carboxy terminus. Transfected cells efficiently secreted recombinant pro-cathepsin E into the culture medium. The secreted pro-cathepsin E was purified in a single step using Ni affinity chromatography yielding a protein of about 92 kDa under non-reducing conditions. The amino-terminal sequence of the purified protein began at Ser20, suggesting human cathepsin E accumulated in the culture supernatant as the pro-enzyme. The purified protein was rapidly and completely converted to the active form by treatment at pH 4.0 or below. Steady state kinetic parameters for hydrolysis of the fluorogenic peptide substrate MOCAc-Gly-Lys-Pro----Arg--Lys(Dnp)-d-Arg-NH2 (cleavage at the  bond) were consistent with previously reported values for purified human enzyme (kc/Ki= 53 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1), Km= 6.3 microM, and kcat= 3 x 10(2) s(-1)). The activated protein was potently inhibited by pepstatin with Ki= 0.2 nM, as well as a reported beta secretase inhibitor. This work demonstrates the potential for producing large quantities of highly purified human cathepsin E from HEK-293 cells in quantities to support both biochemical and structural characterization of the enzyme.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18977279>Binding studies of novel, non-mammalian enkephalins, structures predicted from frog and lungfish brain cDNA sequences.</a></h1><p>- and Met-enkephalin were the first endogenous opioid peptides identified in different mammalian species including the human. Comparative biochemical and bioinformatic evidence indicates that enkephalins are not limited to mammals. Various prodynorphin (PDYN) sequences in lower vertebrates revealed the presence of other enkephalin fingerprints in these precursor polypeptides. Among the novel enkephalins -enkephalin (Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-) was primarily observed in the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) PDYNs, while the structure of Phe-enkephalin (Tyr-Gly-Gly-) was predicted by analyzing brain cDNA sequences encoding a PDYN of the African lungfish (Protopterus annectens). -enkephalin can also be found in the PDYNs of four other fish species including the eel, bichir, zebrafish and tilapia, but no further occurrence for the Phe-enkephalin motif is available as yet. Based on sequencing data, the biological relevance of Phe- and -enkephalin is suggested, because both of them can arise by regular posttranslational enzymatic processing of the respective neuropeptide precursors. In various receptor binding assays performed on rat brain membrane preparations both of the new peptides turned out to be moderate affinity opioids with a weak preference for the delta-opioid receptor (DOP) sites. Phe-enkephalin of the lungfish displayed rather unexpectedly low affinities toward the mu-opioid receptor (MOP) and DOP, while exhibiting moderate affinity toward the kappa-opioid receptor (KOP). In receptor-mediated G-protein activation assays measured by the stimulation of [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding, Met-enkephalin produced the highest stimulation followed by -enkephalin, -enkephalin and Phe-enkephalin, whereas the least efficacious among these endogenous peptides was still more effective than the prototype opiate agonist morphine in these functional tests.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1176441>Calcium-binding protein of bovine intestine. The complete amino acid sequence.</a></h1><p>The amino acid sequence for vitamin D-dependent bovine intestinal calcium binding protein has been established. It contains 85 amino acids in a single chain and lacks cysteine, tryptophan, methionine, histidine, and arginine. The NH2-terminal lysine is blocked by an N-acetyl group. Enzymatic digestion with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and pepsin yielded a number of peptides which were purified by two-dimensional high voltage paper electrophoresis. These peptides were examined by end group analysis and sequenced by the dansyl procedure. The absence of tryptophan permitted by a single cleavage of the molecule by N-bromosuccinimide at the tyrosine residue at position 8 and the larger fragment was subjected to automated Edman degradation. By these means, the following sequence was established: N-Ac-Lys-Gln-Ser-Pro--Glu-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Glu-Lys-Ser--Gln-Lys-Glu--Glu-Lys-Gly--Lys-Gln---Val-Ser-Val-Gln-Lys-Ala-Gly-Asp-Lys-Glu-Ser--Gln-Pro--Phe-Thr---Lys-Ser-Gly-Pro-Glu-Glu-Asn--Lys-Glu-Ser-Gln-Asn-Gly-Pro-Asp--Ls7-Ser-Gly-Pro-Gly-Asn-Asp--Glu-Glu-Lys-Gly-Thr-Asp-Val-Phe-Ser--Lys-Gln. Microheterogeneity may exist in the molecule at residue 76 in which position threonine may be replaced by serine. Comparison of the sequence of calcium-binding protein to the "test" sequence of Tufty and Kretsinger ((1975) Science 187, 167-169) proposed to identify E-F hands in muscle proteins suggests that intestinal calcium-binding protein may likewise contain one or possibly two E-F hands which could account for calcium-binding property. Dayhoff alignment scores, however, calculated for calcium-binding protein against nine E-F hands in muscle proteins parvalbumin, troponin and alkali light chains do not indicate that intestinal calcium-binding protein is homologous to these muscle protein chains.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28844736>Structure and binding studies of proliferating cell nuclear antigen from Leishmania donovani.</a></h1><p>Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) acts as a sliding clamp to support DNA replication and repair. The structure of PCNA from Leishmania donovani (LdPCNA) has been determined at 2.73Å resolution. Structure consists of six crystallographically independent molecules which form two trimeric rings. The pore diameter of the individual trimeric ring is of the order of 37Å. The two rings are stacked through their front to front faces. In order to gain a stable packing, the rings are rotated by 42° about the pore axis and shifted by 7Å and tilted by 16° along the perpendicular direction to pore axis. This form of stacking reduced the effective diameter of the pore to 32Å. The sequence of LdPCNA consists of a long segment of 41 amino acid residues (186-Gly-Val-Ser-Asp-Arg-Ser-Thr-Lys-Ser-Glu-Val-Lys-Ala-Glu-Val-Lys-Ala-Glu-Ala-Arg-Asp-Asp-Asp-Glu-Glu-Pro--Ser-Arg-Lys-Tyr-Gly-Lys-Ala-Asp-Ser-Ser-Ala-Asn-Ala--226) whereas the corresponding segments in other PCNAs contain only eight residues corresponding to 186-Gly-Val-Ser-Asp-Arg------224-Asn-Ala--226. The enhanced length of this segment in LdPCNA may influence its mode of interaction with DNA and other proteins.

The corresponding values obtained using fluorescence spectroscopic methods were 0.22±0.06μM, 0.68±0.07μM, 0.44±0.07μM and 0.75±0.05μM respectively.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We designed and constructed decapeptides, based on the known sequence cleavage specificities of bacterial pepstatin-insensitive carboxyl proteases (BPICP). MOCAc-Gly-Lys-Pro--Pro--Arg--Lys(Dnp)r-NH(2) is readily hydrolyzed by Cln2p/TPP-I (K(cat)/K(m) = 7.8 s(-1) mM(-1)). The enzyme had a maximal activity at pH 3.0 for an endopeptidase substrate, but at pH 4.5 with respect to tripeptidyl peptidase activity. Both endopeptidase and tripeptidyl peptidase activities were strongly inhibited by Ala-Ala-Phe-CH(2)Cl, but not inhibited by tyrostatin, an inhibitor of bacterial pepstatin-insensitive carboxyl proteases, pepstatin, or inhibitors of serine proteases. Fibroblasts from classical late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis patients have less than 5% of the normal tripeptidyl peptidase activity and pepstatin-insensitive endopeptidase activity.

The enzyme was shown to be composed of two polypeptide chains (a 31-kDa heavy chain and a 23-kDa light chain) cross-linked by disulfide bond(s). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the heavy chain was determined to be Ala-Gly-Val- Asp-Gly-Tyr--Val-Pro-Tyr-Val--Phe-Asp--Tyr-Gly--Pro-Tyr and that of the light chain to be Ala-Glu-Pro-Pro-. The heavy chain contained carbohydrate moiety composed of mannose, glucosamine, fucose, and glucose. The enzyme was optimally active at pH 1.7 toward hemoglobin as a substrate. Among the proteinase inhibitors tested only diazoacetyl-D,L-norleucine methyl ester, a typical aspartic proteinase inhibitor, inhibited the acid proteinase in the presence of cupric ions. It was insensitive to the other typical aspartic proteinase inhibitors, pepstatin A and 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane. The enzyme hydrolyzed Lys-Pro--Glu-Phe(4-NO2)-Arg- at the (4-NO2) bond, but could not hydrolyze another synthetic pepsin-substrate, N-acetyl-L-phenylalanyl-3,5-diiodo-L-tyrosine. The enzyme showed a unique substrate specificity toward oxidized insulin B chain. The major cleavage sites were the bonds Gly8-Ser9, Leu11-Val12, Cya19-Gly20, and Phe24-Phe25, and the Gly8-Ser9 bond was most susceptible. These results indicate that the enzyme is a novel type of intracellular acid proteinase with a unique substrate specificity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/518867>Isolation and characterization of bovine plasma prekallikrein (Fletcher factor).</a></h1><p>Prekallikrein (Fletcher factor) has been purified from bovine plasma approximately 25 000-fold with an overall yield of 14%. Purification steps included ammonium sulfate fractionation and column chromatography on heparin-agarose, DEAE-Sephadex, CM-Sephadex, benzamidine-agarose, and arginine methyl ester-agarose. The purified protein was homogeneous as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and amino-terminal sequence analysis. Bovine plasma prekallikrein is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 82 000 as determined by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation. It contains 12.9% carbohydrate, including 6.2% hexose, 4.5% N-acetylglucosamine, and 2.2% N-acetylneuraminic acid. Prekallikrein is a single polypeptide chain with an amino-terminal sequence of Gly-Cys--Thr-Gln--Tyr-His-Asn---Arg-Gly-Gly. This sequence is homologous to the amino-terminal sequence of human factor XI (plasma thromboplastin antecedent).

An initial fluorescence, due to incomplete energy transfer, of about 8% of the values attained after complete substrate hydrolysis; a non-linear standard curve even at microM concentrations and an exponential decay of the steady state fluorescence of reaction product of the order of 10(-4) x s(-1) were the main analytical problems encountered. The standard curves for fluorescence of the substrate reaction product after 48 h of hydrolysis, and the reference compound MOCAc-Pro--Gly-NH(2), were fitted by polynomial approximation and the point derivates used as calibration factors. Time dependence of the calibration factor for the reaction product was -2.96 x 10(-4) a.u microM(-1) x s(-1) that is, in the same order of observed enzymic reaction rates. A mathematical treatment was devised for obtaining rates corrected for errors derived from the three analytical problems indicated. The method is of general application in continuous fluorometric assays, irrespective of the particular enzyme used, but of special value for substrates that present significant initial fluorescence.

The structural similarity between the sturgeon and the trout tachykinins supports the hypothesis that the Acipenseriformes (sturgeons and paddlefish) represent the sister group of the Neopterygii (gars, bowfin, and teleosts).Copyright 1999 Academic Press.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3139097>Botulinum neurotoxin type B (strain 657): partial sequence and similarity with tetanus toxin.</a></h1><p>The type B neurotoxin (NT) isolated from Clostridium botulinum (strain 657) behaved as a mixture of single (unnicked) and dichain (nicked) proteins, both of Mr approximately 150 kDa. When the dichain NT was reduced by mercaptoethanol, the two chains migrated in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) as separate polypeptides of Mr approximately 100 and 50 kDa that appeared similar to the heavy and light chains of other serotypes of botulinum NT. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the two chains were determined. They were as follows: light chain: Pro-Val-Thr--Asn-Asn-Phe-Asn-Tyr-Asn-Asp-Pro--Asp-Asn-Asn-Asn-- -Met - Met-Glu-Pro-Pro-Phe-Ala-Arg-Gly-Met-Gly-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Lys-Ala-Phe-Lys-- Thr-Asp - Arg--Trp--; and heavy chain: Ala-Pro-Gly--X--Asp-Val-Asp-Asn-Glu-Asp----Ala-Asp-Ly s-Asn- Ser-Phe-Arg-Asp-Asp--. These two sequences matched exactly with those of the light and heavy chains of type B NT (strain Okra) of which only 16 and 18 residues were known (J. Biol. Chem. (1985) 260, 10461). The above sequences were different from those of type A NT. Immunoprecipitation reactions of type B NT isolated from strains 657 and Okra were indistinguishable against polyclonal anti-type B NT serum. These two preparations did not produce precipitin reactions with polyclonal anti-type A NT serum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9047300>Characterization of the basic amphiphilic alpha-helix calmodulin-binding domain of a 61.5 kDa tobacco calmodulin-binding protein.</a></h1><p>A 19-amino acid residue peptide, Gly-Trp--Lys--Lys-Ala-Ala-Met-Arg-Trp-Gly--Val-Arg-Lys-Lys- Ala, corresponding to the basic amphiphilic alpha-helix (BAA) motif at the C-terminus of a recombinant tobacco calmodulin-binding protein, TCB60, was synthesized. The interaction of the synthetic binding domain with calmodulin (CaM) was analyzed by gel mobility shift assays, phosphodiesterase competition assays, and fluorescence, circular dichroism, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Mobility shift assays showed an apparent 2 kDa increase in CaM Mr in presence of synthetic peptide and CaCl2 in 4 M urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. HPLC measurements of hydrolysis of cyclic AMP by CaM-dependent phosphodiesterase indicated the synthetic peptide competitively inhibits (Ki = 15-20 nM) stimulation of phosphodiesterase activity by CaM. Upon binding CaM, the fluorescence emission maximum of the synthetic peptide, which contained two tryptophanyl residues, shifted toward blue and increased in intensity. The circular dichroism spectra indicated the ellipticity of CaM increased at 208 and 222 nm upon complex formation with the synthetic peptide. 1H NMR studies showed that the peptide interacts with the aromatic residues in domains I and III of CaM. Taken together, these data provide direct evidence that the structurally conserved basic amphiphilic alpha-helix CaM-binding domain of the recombinant tobacco CaM-binding protein interacts with CaM at physiologically significant nanomolar concentrations and the microenvironments of both CaM and the synthetic binding domain are modified upon complex formation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7479953>An unmodified heptadecapeptide pheromone induces competence for genetic transformation in Streptococcus pneumoniae.</a></h1><p>Competence for genetic transformation in Streptococcus pneumoniae has been known for three decades to arise in growing cultures at a critical cell density, in response to a secreted protease-sensitive signal. We show that strain CP1200 produces a 17-residue peptide that induces cells of the species to develop competence. The sequence of the peptide was found to be H-Glu-Met-Arg--Ser-Lys--Arg-Asp-Phe---Gln-Arg- Lys-Lys-OH. A synthetic peptide of the same sequence was shown to be biologically active in small quantities and to extend the range of conditions suitable for development of competence. Cognate codons in the pneumococcal chromosome indicate that the peptide is made ribosomally. As the gene encodes a prepeptide containing the Gly-Gly consensus processing site found in peptide bacteriocins, the peptide is likely to be exported by a specialized ATP-binding cassette transport protein as is characteristic of these bacteriocins. The hypothesis is presented that this transport protein is encoded by comA, previously shown to be required for elaboration of the pneumococcal competence activator.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3290486>Synthesis and renin inhibitory activity of angiotensinogen analogues having dehydrostatine,  psi [CH2S]Val, or  psi [CH2SO]Val at the P1-P1' cleavage site.</a></h1><p>The synthesis and in vitro renin inhibitory potencies of angiotensinogen (ANG) analogues having amide (CONH) bond replacements at P1-P1', the -Val cleavage site, corresponding to  psi[CH2SO]Val, and the trans olefinic analogue of statine (Sta), 4(S)-amino-6-methyl-2(E)-heptenoic acid (dehydrostatine, Dhs), are reported. These are compared to P1-P1'  psi[CH2NH]Val-, Sta-, or -substituted analogues of the same template. The Dhs pseudodipeptide was found to be an adequate mimic of a trans CONH bond and gave a peptide, H-Pro-His-Pro-Phe-His-Dhs--His-D-Lys-OH, approximately equal in potency to a -containing inhibitor, but 200-fold less potent than its Sta-substituted congener. That the enhanced potency of the Sta-containing peptide most likely depends on hydrogen bonding as well as tetrahedral geometry is indicated by the 50-100-fold lower potency of the tetrahedral  psi[CH2S]Val and  psi[CH2SO]Val analogues as compared to the  psi[CH2NH]Val-containing congener.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2830254>The primary structure of chicken muscle acylphosphatase isozyme Ch2.</a></h1><p>The amino acid sequence of one, Ch2, of the two isozymes of chicken muscle acylphosphatase was determined.

The different lengths of hydrophobic peptides were attached to the C-terminus of the hen egg white lysozyme to investigate the most effective length of the hydrophobic peptides for killing bacteria. The oligonucleotides encoding Phe-Val-Pro (H3), -Val-Ala-Pro (H5) and -Val-Ala---Pro (H7) were fused to the C-terminus  129 of lysozyme cDNA. The reconstructed cDNAs were inserted into the yeast expression vector. The hydrophobic peptide-fused lysozymes were secreted in the yeast carrying the reconstructed cDNA. Although the hydrophobic peptide-fused lysozymes retained 75 80% lytic activity of the wild-type protein, the bactericidal action to E. coli was greatly increased with the length of hydrophobic peptides. These results suggest that the hydrophobic peptides play an important role in killing Gram-negative bacteria. To elucidate the role of catalytic domain in bactericidal action of the hydrophobic fusion lysozyme (H5-Lz), the mutant hydrophobic lysozyme (H5/E35A-Lz) whose glutamic acid was substituted with alanine at the position 35 was constructed to diminish the catalytic activity. The mutant hydrophobic lysozyme (H5/E35A-Lz) was greatly lost the bactericidal action to E. coli, suggesting that not only the length of hydrophobic peptide fused to C-terminus but also the catalytic domain is important for the bactericidal action of the hydrophobic peptide-fused lysozyme.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12742517>Potentiation of metabotropic GABAB receptors by L-amino acids and dipeptides in rat neocortex.</a></h1><p>Selected neutral L-alpha-amino acids, and their dipeptides, were reversible, stereospecific, potentiators of GABA(B) receptor-mediated hyperpolarizing responses to baclofen (3-100 microM) in rat neocortical slices.

This and another synthetic PK segment of residues (328-343) present in the fourth tandem repeat sequence [Cys(ACM)-Ser--Arg--Ser-Thr-Asp-Gly-Ser-Pro-Thr-Arg--Thr-Tyr] and synthesized by a solid-phase method, were fully characterized by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, amino acid composition and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Proteolysis of these peptides by either rat PK (rPK) or trypsin resulted in cleavages between Arg decreases Gly for pPK (11-23) and between Arg decreases  and Arg decreases  for rPK (328-343). Kinetic studies revealed that for peptide pPK (11-23), the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of rPK is congruent to 9-fold higher than that of trypsin, but for the other peptide, rPK (328-343), kcat/Km of trypsin is congruent to 49-fold higher than that of rPK. The facile cleavage of pPK (11-23) by rPK confirms the Arg13 decreases Gly14 position as the site of autolytic degradation of PK and also explains its special preference for -Arg sequence.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10191281>Specificity of human tissue kallikrein towards substrates containing  pair of amino acids.</a></h1><p>We have explored in detail the determinants of specificity for the hydrolysis by human tissue kallikrein (hK1) of substrates containing the  amino acid pair, after which hK1 cleaves kallistatin (human kallikrein-binding protein), a specific serpin for this protease, as well as somatostatin 1-14. Internally quenched fluorogenic peptides were synthesized with the general structure Abz-peptidyl-EDDnp [Abz, o-aminobenzoic acid; EDDnp, N-(2, 4-dinitrophenyl)ethylenediamine], based on the natural reactive-centre loop sequence of kallistatin from P9 to P'13, and the kinetic parameters of their hydrolysis by hK1 were determined. All these peptides were cleaved after the  pair. For comparison, we have also examined peptides containing the reactive-centre loop sequences of human protein-C inhibitor (PCI) and rat kallikrein-binding protein, which were hydrolysed after Phe-Arg and -Lys bonds, respectively. Hybrid peptides containing kallistatin-PCI sequences showed that the efficiency of hK1 activity on the peptides containing kallistatin and PCI sequences depended on both the nature of the P1 amino acid as well as on residues at the P- and P'-sides. Moreover, we have made systematic modifications on the hydrophobic pair , and on Lys and  at the P3 and P4 positions according to the peptide substrate, Abz-AIKFFSRQ-EDDnp. All together, we concluded that tissue kallikrein was very effective on short substrates that are cleaved after the Phe-Arg pair; however, hydrolysis after  or other hydrophobic pairs of amino acids was more restrictive, requiring additional enzyme-substrate interaction and/or particular substrate conformations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23302536>Bioactive metabolites from Guignardia sp., an endophytic fungus residing in Undaria pinnatifida.</a></h1><p>To isolate new and/or bioactive constituents from EtOAc extract of liquid culture of endophyte Guignardia sp. from the leaves of Undaria pinnatifida (Harv.)

Sequence analyses were performed on the intact S-carboxymethylated protein, two fragments derived from CNBr cleavage, and three peptides recovered from mouse submaxillary protease digestion of the reduced and S-carboxymethylated enzyme. The peptides were aligned by characterizing peptides yielded by trypsin and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. All the peptides studied were purified exclusively by reverse-phase columns of HPLC and were analyzed with an improved liquid-phase sequencer. A molecular weight of 15,750 (subunit) was calculated from the 151 residues sequenced. The amino acid sequence of the Drosophila superoxide dismutase subunit is compared with that of four other eucaryotes: man, horse, cow, and yeast. Comparison of the five primary structures reveals very different rates of evolution at different times. Copper-zinc superoxide dismutase appears to be a very erratic evolutionary clock.

Their identification was achieved by amino acid analysis and tryptic peptide mapping, supplemented in some instances by carboxy-terminal analyses with carboxypeptidases A, B, and Y and amino-terminal analyses with dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I. The results showed that major plasmic cleavage sites included the Lys89-Asn90, Lys133-Ser134, and Lys153-Leu154 bonds. Cleavages also occurred at the Arg31-His32, Lys53-Arg54, and Arg25-His26 bonds, but these appeared to be less extensive. A large number of additional peptides were produced in relatively low yield. The smaller of these were isolated from heterogeneous fractions by high-voltage electrophoresis-TLC. Amino acid analysis of these peptides showed that minor cleavage sites included the Arg9-His10, Lys13-Tyr14, Lys103-Gly104, Lys137-Gly138, Lys140-Gly141, and Arg160-Ser161 bonds. In spite of a lower selectivity toward peptide bonds in BP as compared with pepsin, cathepsin D, and thrombin, plasmin has the advantage over the former proteinases in that it does not cleave at or near the Phe44-Phe45 bond. Instead it cleaves at the Arg31-His32 and Lys53-Arg54 bonds, thus preserving the entire hydrophobic sequence --Asp-Ser--Gly-Arg- as well as short sequences to either side.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3688881>Rat brain cathepsin L: characterization and differentiation from cathepsin B utilizing opioid peptides.</a></h1><p>The specificity of purified rat brain cathepsin L (EC 3.4.22.15) was mapped by the use of synthetic and opioid peptides and some properties were compared to rat brain cathepsin B, rat kidney cathepsin L, and bovine spleen cathepsin C. Brain and kidney cathepsin L cleaved leucine or methionine enkephalin (LE or ME) at the Gly-Gly bond to release Tyr-Gly and Gly-Phe- (-Met). In studies on pro-opioids, the brain enzyme also recognized Met-Arg, Arg-Arg, and Arg- bonds; the best substrates on a relative basis were ME-Arg-Phe, LE- or ME-Arg-Arg, and LE-Arg-Arg-. Measurement of kinetic values in relation to the sites of opioid cleavage provided a basis to differentiate brain cathepsins B and L. Cathepsin L acted with high affinity toward LE to cleave Gly2-Gly3 (Km 82.5 microM, kcat 2034 min-1), in contrast to low affinity cleavage by cathepsin B at Gly3-Phe4. Kapp, the second-order rate constant of enzyme inactivation by Z--CHN2 with LE as substrate was 31,530 M-1 s-1 or 10(3) higher than its effect on cathepsin B-mediated hydrolysis of ME-Arg-Phe at the Met-Arg site. Gly-Gly cleavage by cathepsin L was blocked by D-Ala2, did not require the presence of free end groups, and was the only site recognized within opioid peptides having a C-terminal Arg-COOH. The use of opioid peptides as substrates provides further insight into cathepsin L specificity. For these the susceptible sites were flanked primarily by hydrophobic and aromatic groups at P2, P2' or P3'.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6162003>Cleavage of rabbit myelin basic protein by pepsin.</a></h1><p>Rapid cleavage of bovine and guinea pig myelin basic proteins by pepsin at pH 6.0 is limited to the  bond in the middle of the molecule. In the rabbit protein, however, rapid cleavages occur elsewhere in addition to the Phe87-Phe88 bond in regions in which there are amino acid substitutions. Rapid cleavage occurs at the Leu151-Phe152 bond, at which -151 has been replaced by , the residue that actually contributes the scissile bond. Rapid cleavages occur at the Phe44-Phe45 and Leu109-Ser110 bonds, which in the bovine and guinea pig proteins are relatively resistant under the experimental conditions (pH 6.0). The increased susceptibility of these bonds in the rabbit protein appears to be related to the replacement of Gly-46 by Ser and the change in the sequence immediately NH2-terminal to -109, from -Ser to Thr-Val. These cleavages of the rabbit protein at the four very susceptible bonds have permitted us to isolate peptides (1-44), (45-87), (88-109), (110-151), and (152-168) in high yield. We have also isolated peptides (88-151), (1-14), and (15-44) in low yield; the latter two result from limited cleavage at the relatively resistant Tyr14-Leu15 bond. Peptide (88-109) has been chromatographically resolved into species differing in the degree of methylation of Arg-105; this resolution is thought to result from differences in hydrogen bonding ability of the guanidinium groups.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22830497>New cathepsin D inhibitor library utilizing hydroxyethyl isosteres with cyclic tertiary amines.</a></h1><p>The design and synthesis of hydroxyethylamine isosteres as inhibitors of cathepsin D based on SAR data have been accomplished.

In contrast, an extract of the Atlantic cod. Gadus morhua contained only neurokinin-A-like immunoreactivity (151 pmol/g). This apparent paradox was resolved by determination of the primary structures of the fish tachykinins.

Cod substance P (Lys-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Gln-Phe--Gly--MetNH2), however, contains a substitution at position 8 (Phe----) that abolishes reactivity with the antiserum to substance P but permits reactivity with the antiserum to neurokinin A. The amino acid sequence of cod and trout neurokinin A is the same (His-Lys--Asn-Ser-Phe-Val-Gly--MetNH2) and shows two substitutions (Thr3---- and Asp4----Asn) compared with mammalian neurokinin A.

Purified alpha-amylase has a molecular weight estimated as 56,000 daltons. The 58,000-dalton, cell-free product and alpha-amylase share common peptides as determined by analysis of their limited proteolysis digests. The cross-reactivity and peptide homology suggest that the cell-free product may be a precursor of mature alpha-amylase. While the NH2 terminus of alpha-amylase is blocked, that of the 58,000-dalton product evidently is not, and automated sequence analysis has yielded its partial sequence as: Met-X-----X---X--X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-Phe-X-X-X-X-X--X-X--Phe. The highly hydrophobic nature of the NH2 terminus of the 58,000-dalton, cell-free product suggests that, like other secreted polypeptides, the extra piece may play a role in the transport and secretion of the mature alpha-amylase.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29351078>Asymmetric peptidomimetics containing L-tartaric acid core inhibit the aspartyl peptidase activity and growth of Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes.</a></h1><p>Aspartyl-type peptidases are promising chemotherapeutic targets in protozoan parasites. In the present work, we identified an aspartyl peptidase activity from the soluble extract of Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes, which cleaved the fluorogenic peptide 7-methoxycoumarin-4-acetyl-Gly-Lys-Pro----Arg--Lys(DNP)-D-Arg-amide (cathepsin D substrate) under acidic pH conditions at 37°C, showing a KM of 0.58 μM and Vmax of 129.87 fluorescence arbitrary units/s mg protein. The leishmanial aspartyl peptidase activity was blocked by pepstatin A (IC50 = 6.8 μM) and diazo-acetyl-norleucinemetilester (IC50 = 10.2 μM), two classical aspartyl peptidase inhibitors. Subsequently, the effects of 6 asymmetric peptidomimetics, containing L-tartaric acid core, were tested on both aspartyl peptidase and growth of L. amazonensis promastigotes. The peptidomimetics named 88, 154 and 158 promoted a reduction of 50% on the leishmanial aspartyl peptidase activity at concentrations ranging from 40 to 85 μM, whereas the peptidomimetic 157 was by far the most effective, presenting IC50 of 0.04 μM. Furthermore, the peptidomimetics 157 and 154 reduced the parasite proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, displaying IC50 values of 33.7 and 44.5 μM, respectively. Collectively, the peptidomimetic 157 was the most efficient compound able to arrest both aspartyl peptidase activity and leishmanial proliferation, which raises excellent perspectives regarding its use against this human pathogenic protozoan.</p></html>
