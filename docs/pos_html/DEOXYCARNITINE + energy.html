<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27112275>The impact of altered carnitine availability on acylcarnitine metabolism, energy expenditure and glucose tolerance in diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>Acylcarnitines are fatty acid oxidation (FAO) intermediates, which have been implicated in diet-induced insulin resistance. Elevated acylcarnitine levels are found in obese, insulin resistant humans and rodents, and coincide with lower free carnitine. We hypothesized that increasing free carnitine levels by administration of the carnitine precursor γ-butyrobetaine (γBB) could facilitate FAO, thereby improving insulin sensitivity.C57BL/6N mice were fed with a high fat or chow diet with or without γBB supplementation (n=10 per group). After 8weeks of diet, indirect calorimetry, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity tests were performed. AC profiles and carnitine biosynthesis intermediates were analyzed in plasma and tissues by tandem mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography tandem MS.γBB supplementation did not facilitate FAO, was unable to curb bodyweight and did not prevent impaired glucose homeostasis in the HFD fed mice in spite of marked alterations in the acylcarnitine profiles in plasma and liver. Remarkably, γBB did not affect the acylcarnitine profile in other tissues, most notably muscle. Administration of a bolus acetylcarnitine also caused significant changes in plasma and liver, but not in muscle acylcarnitine profiles, again without effect on glucose tolerance.Altogether, increasing carnitine availability affects acylcarnitine profiles in plasma and liver but does not modulate glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity. This may be due to the lack of an effect on muscle acylcarnitine profiles, as muscle tissue is an important contributor to whole body insulin sensitivity. These results warrant caution on making associations between plasma acylcarnitine levels and insulin resistance.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Inhibition of OCTN2 leads to a decrease in carnitine and acylcarnitine contents in tissues and  metabolism optimization-related cardioprotective effects. The recent inclusion of meldonium in the World Anti-Doping Agency List of Prohibited Substances and Methods has raised questions about the pharmacokinetics of meldonium and its unusually long elimination time. Therefore, in this study, the rate of meldonium washout after the end of the treatment was tested with and without administration of carnitine, γ-butyrobetaine (GBB) and furosemide to evaluate the importance of competition for OCTN2 transport in mice. Here, we show that carnitine and GBB administration during the washout period effectively stimulated the elimination of meldonium. GBB induced a more pronounced effect on meldonium elimination than carnitine due to the higher affinity of GBB for OCTN2. The diuretic effect of furosemide did not significantly affect the elimination of meldonium, carnitine and GBB. In conclusion, the competition of meldonium, carnitine and GBB for OCTN2-mediated transport determines the pharmacokinetic properties of meldonium. Thus, due to their affinity for OCTN2, GBB and carnitine but not furosemide stimulated meldonium elimination. During long-term treatment, OCTN2-mediated transport ensures a high muscle content of meldonium, while tissue clearance depends on relatively slow diffusion, thus resulting in the unusually long complete elimination period of meldonium.© 2016 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former Nordic Pharmacological Society).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27993177>Diets high in resistant starch increase plasma levels of trimethylamine-N-oxide, a gut microbiome metabolite associated with CVD risk.</a></h2><p>Production of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a biomarker of CVD risk, is dependent on intestinal microbiota, but little is known of dietary conditions promoting changes in gut microbial communities. Resistant starches (RS) alter the human microbiota. We sought to determine whether diets varying in RS and carbohydrate (CHO) content affect plasma TMAO levels. We also assessed postprandial glucose and insulin responses and plasma lipid changes to diets high and low in RS. In a cross-over trial, fifty-two men and women consumed a 2-week baseline diet (41 percentage of energy (%E) CHO, 40 % fat, 19 % protein), followed by 2-week high- and low-RS diets separated by 2-week washouts. RS diets were assigned at random within the context of higher (51-53 %E) v. lower CHO (39-40 %E) intake. Measurements were obtained in the fasting state and, for glucose and insulin, during a meal test matching the composition of the assigned diet. With lower CHO intake, plasma TMAO, carnitine, betaine and γ-butyrobetaine concentrations were higher after the high- v. low-RS diet (P<0·01 each). These metabolites were not differentially affected by high v. low RS when CHO intake was high. Although the high-RS meal reduced postprandial insulin and glucose responses when CHO intake was low (P<0·01 each), RS did not affect fasting lipids, lipoproteins, glucose or insulin irrespective of dietary CHO content. In conclusion, a lower-CHO diet high in RS was associated with higher plasma TMAO levels. These findings, together with the absence of change in fasting lipids, suggest that short-term high-RS diets do not improve markers of cardiometabolic health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25220864>Expression and purification of active, stabilized trimethyllysine hydroxylase.</a></h2><p>Trimethyllysine hydroxylase (TMLH) catalyses the first step in carnitine biosynthesis - the conversion of N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-l-lysine to 3-hydroxy-N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-l-lysine. By changing carnitine availability it is possible to optimise cardiac energy metabolism, that is beneficial under certain ischemic conditions. Previous efforts have been devoted towards the inhibition of  dioxygenase, which catalyses the last step in carnitine biosynthesis. However, the effects of TMLH activity regulation are currently unexplored. To facilitate the development of specific ligands of TMLH, large quantities of recombinant protein are necessary for downstream binding and structural studies. Here, we describe an efficient system for expressing and purifying active and stable TMLH as a maltose-binding protein fusion in Escherichiacoli.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

During acute exercise, the increased demand for FAs results in a state of free carnitine deficiency in plasma. The role of kidney in carnitine homeostasis after exercise is not known.Swiss Webster mice were sacrificed immediately after a 1-hour moderate intensity treadmill run, and at 4-hours and 8-hours into recovery. Non-exercising mice served as controls. Plasma was analyzed for carnitine using acetyltransferase and [14C] acetyl-CoA. Kidney was removed for gene and protein expression of butyrobetaine hydroxylase (γ-BBH), organic cation transporter (OCTN2), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARα), a regulator of fatty acid oxidation activated by FAs.Acute exercise caused a decrease in plasma free carnitine levels. Rapid return of free carnitine to control levels during recovery was associated with increased γ-BBH expression. Both mRNA and protein levels of OCTN2 were detected in kidney after exercise and during recovery, suggesting renal transport mechanisms were stimulated. These changes were accompanied with a reciprocal increase in PPARα protein expression.Our results show that the decrease in free carnitine after exercise rapidly activates carnitine biosynthesis and renal transport mechanism in kidney to establish carnitine homeostasis.© 2017 The Author(s).

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induces cancer stem cell (CSC) characteristics and promotes tumor invasiveness; however relatively little is known about the metabolic reprogramming in EMT. Here we show that breast epithelial cells undergo metabolic reprogramming following EMT. Relative to control, cell lines expressing EMT transcription factors show ≥1.5-fold accumulation of glutamine, glutamate, beta-alanine and glycylleucine as well as ≥1.5-fold reduction of phosphoenolpyruvate, urate, and . Moreover, these metabolic alterations were found to be predictive of overall survival (hazard ratio = 2.3 (95% confidence interval: 1.31-4.2), logrank p-value = 0.03) and define breast cancer molecular subtypes. EMT-associated metabolites are primarily composed of anapleurotic precursors, suggesting that cells undergoing EMT have a shift in energy production. In summary, we describe a unique panel of metabolites associated with EMT and demonstrate that these metabolites have the potential for predicting clinical and biological characteristics associated with patient survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28197778>Evaluating effects of L-carnitine on human bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.</a></h2><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells showing potential for use in regenerative medicine. Culture techniques that are more stable and methods for the more efficient production of MSCs with therapeutic efficacy are needed. We evaluate the effects of growing bone marrow (Bm)-derived MSCs in the presence of L-carnitine, which is believed to promote lipid metabolism and to suppress apoptosis. The presence of L-carnitine decreased the degree of drug-induced apoptosis and suppressed adipogenic differentiation. Metabolomic analysis by means of the exhaustive investigation of metabolic products showed that, in addition to increased β-oxidation and the expression of all carnitine derivatives other than  (an intermediate in carnitine synthesis), polysaturated and polyunsaturated acids were down-regulated. An integrated analysis incorporating both serial analysis of gene expression and metabolomics revealed increases in cell survival, suggesting the utility of carnitine. The addition of carnitine elevated the oxygen consumption rate by BmMSCs that had been cultured for only a few generations and those that had become senescent following repeated replication indicating that mitochondrial activation occurred. Our exhaustive analysis of the effects of various carnitine metabolites thus suggests that the addition of L-carnitine to BmMSCs during expansion enables efficient cell production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30830480>Metabolomic analyses reveal lipid abnormalities and hepatic dysfunction in non-human primate model for Yersinia pestis.</a></h2><p>Pneumonic plague is caused by the aerosolized form of Yersinia pestis and is a highly virulent infection with complex clinical consequences, and without treatment, the fatality rate approaches 100%. The exact mechanisms of disease progression are unclear, with limited work done using metabolite profiling to study disease progression.The aim of this pilot study was to profile the plasma metabolomics in an animal model of Y. pestis infection.In this study, African Green monkeys were challenged with the highly virulent, aerosolized Y. pestis strain CO92, and untargeted metabolomics profiling of plasma was performed using liquid and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry.At early time points post-exposure, we found significant increases in polyunsaturated, long chain fatty acid metabolites with p values ranging from as low as 0.000001 (ratio = 1.94) for the metabolite eicosapentaenoate to 0.04 (ratio = 1.36) for the metabolite adrenate when compared to time-matched controls. Multiple acyl carnitines metabolites were increased at earlier time points and could be a result of fatty acid oxidation defects with p values ranging from as low as 0.00001 (ratio = 2.95) for the metabolite octanoylcarnitine to 0.04 (ratio = 1.33) for metabolite  when compared to time-matched controls. Dicarboxylic acids are important metabolic products of fatty acids oxidation, and when compared to time matched controls, were higher at earlier time points where metabolite tetradecanedioate has a ratio of 4.09 with significant p value of 0.000002 and adipate with a ratio of 1.12 and p value of 0.004. The metabolites from lysolipids (with significant p values ranging from 0.00006 for 1-oleoylglycerophosphoethanolamine to 0.04 for 1-stearoylglycerophosphoethanolamine and a ratio of 0.47 and 0.78, respectively) and bile acid metabolism (with significant p values ranging from 0.02 for cholate to 0.04 for deoxycholate and a ratio of 0.39 and 0.66, respectively) pathways were significantly lower compared to their time-matched controls during the entire course of infection. Metabolite levels from amino acid pathways were disrupted, and a few from the leucine, isoleucine and valine pathway were significantly higher (p values ranging from 0.002 to 0.04 and ratios ranging from 1.3 to 1.5, respectively), whereas metabolites from the urea cycle, arginine and proline pathways were significantly lower (p values ranging from 0.00008 to 0.02 and ratios ranging from 0.5 to 0.7, respectively) during the course of infection.The involvement of several lipid pathways post-infection suggested activation of pathways linked to inflammation and oxidative stress. Metabolite data further showed increased energy demand, and multiple metabolites indicated potential hepatic dysfunction. Integration of blood metabolomics and transcriptomics data identified linoleate as a core metabolite with cross-talk with multiple genes from various time points. Collectively, the data from this study provided new insights into the mechanisms of Y. pestis pathogenesis that may aid in development of therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26850121>Pharmacological effects of meldonium: Biochemical mechanisms and biomarkers of cardiometabolic activity.</a></h2><p>Meldonium (mildronate; 3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrazinium)propionate; THP; MET-88) is a clinically used cardioprotective drug, which mechanism of action is based on the regulation of energy metabolism pathways through l-carnitine lowering effect. l-Carnitine biosynthesis enzyme γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase and carnitine/organic cation transporter type 2 (OCTN2) are the main known drug targets of meldonium, and through inhibition of these activities meldonium induces adaptive changes in the cellular energy homeostasis. Since l-carnitine is involved in the metabolism of fatty acids, the decline in its levels stimulates glucose metabolism and decreases concentrations of l-carnitine related metabolites, such as long-chain acylcarnitines and trimethylamine-N-oxide.

Declines in skeletal muscle and functionality not only impacts mobility but also increases chronic disease risk, such as type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to measure adaptive metabolic responses to acute changes in habitual activity in a cohort of overweight, pre-diabetic older adults (age = 69 ± 4 years; BMI = 27 ± 4 kg/m,  = 17) when using non-targeted metabolite profiling by multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. Participants completed two weeks of step reduction (<1000 steps/day) followed by a two week recovery period, where fasting plasma samples were collected at three time intervals at baseline, after step reduction and following recovery. Two weeks of step reduction elicited increases in circulatory metabolites associated with a decline in muscle energy metabolism and protein degradation, including glutamine, carnitine and creatine ( < 0.05; effect size > 0.30), as well as methionine and  ( < 0.05; effect size ≈ 0.20) as compared to baseline. Similarly, decreases in uremic toxins in plasma that promote muscle inflammation, indoxyl sulfate and hippuric acid, as well as oxoproline, a precursor used for intramuscular glutathione recycling, were also associated with physical inactivity ( < 0.05; effect size > 0.20). Our results indicate that older persons are susceptible to metabolic perturbations due to short-term step reduction that were not fully reversible with resumption of normal ambulatory activity over the same time period. These plasma biomarkers may enable early detection of inactivity-induced metabolic dysregulation in older persons at risk for sarcopenia not readily measured by current imaging techniques or muscle function tests, which is required for the design of therapeutic interventions to counter these deleterious changes in support of healthy ageing.</p></html>
