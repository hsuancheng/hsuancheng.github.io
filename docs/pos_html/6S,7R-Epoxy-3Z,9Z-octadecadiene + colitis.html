Increasing evidence suggests the involvement of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) receptors in the development of neurogenic inflammation in the pelvis and pelvic organ cross-sensitization. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that desensitization of TRPV1 receptors in the urinary bladder can minimize the effects of cross-sensitization induced by experimental  on excitability of bladder spinal neurons. Extracellular activity of bladder neurons was recorded in response to graded urinary bladder distension (UBD) in rats pretreated with intravesical resiniferatoxin (RTX, 10(-7)M). Colonic inflammation was induced by intracolonic instillation of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). The duration of excitatory responses to noxious UBD during acute colonic inflammation (3 days post-TNBS) was significantly shortened in the group with RTX pretreatment (25.3±1.5s, n=49) when compared to the control group (35.1±4.2s, n=43, p<0.05). The duration of long-lasting excitatory responses, but not short-lasting responses of bladder spinal neurons during acute  was significantly reduced by RTX from 52.9±6. (n=21, vehicle group) to 34.4±2.1s (RTX group, n=21, p<0.05). However, activation of TRPV1 receptors in the urinary bladder prior to acute  increased the number of bladder neurons receiving input from large somatic fields from 22.7% to 58.2% (p<0.01). The results of our study provide evidence that intravesical RTX reduces the effects of viscerovisceral cross-talk induced by colonic inflammation on bladder spinal neurons. However, RTX enhances the responses of bladder neurons to somatic stimulation, thereby limiting its therapeutic potential.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Role of reactive oxygen metabolites.</a></h2><p>Reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs) are partially reduced oxygen species that include superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, and hypohalous acids. Formation of superoxide or hydrogen peroxide may be injurious to tissue directly; however, it is thought that the primary mediators of tissue damage are the secondarily derived oxidants such as hydroxyl radical and hypohalous acid. The gastrointestinal tract is particularly well endowed with the enzymatic machinery necessary to form large amounts of ROMs. Sources of ROMs in the gastrointestinal tract include mucosal oxidases such as xanthine oxidase, amine oxidase, and aldehyde oxidase as well as the NADPH oxidase found in the resident phagocytic leukocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils) of the lamina propria. We have demonstrated that reperfusion of ischemic small intestine results in substantial mucosal injury that is mediated by oxy radicals generated from xanthine oxidase and inflammatory leukocytes. The final mediator of toxicity appears to be the hydroxyl radical derived from the iron-catalyzed interaction between superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Data from our laboratories as well as other laboratories suggest that reactive oxygen metabolites may play an important role in mediating mucosal injury during active episodes of ulcerative . We present a working hypothesis which states that transient ischemic episodes in the bowel initiate a cascade of self-perpetuating cycles of ROM formation, inflammation and, ultimately, mucosal injury.</p></html>
