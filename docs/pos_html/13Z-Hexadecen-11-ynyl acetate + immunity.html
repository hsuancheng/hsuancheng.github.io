Inflammation and uremia negatively impact immune function in this population, but specific pathways involved in TB  have not been identified. Although γδ T cells are known to contribute to protection from TB, their phenotype and function in patients with ESRD is relatively unknown. To determine this we recruited 20 patients with and 20 without ESRD (controls), with or without latent TB infection to assess γδ T cell frequency, surface phenotype, and cytokine production by flow cytometry in response to stimulation. γδ T cells derived from patients with ESRD exhibited significantly lower expression of CCR5, CXCR3, and CD26 compared to controls. Furthermore, patients with ESRD, particularly the group with latent TB infection, exhibited poor IFNγ, TNFα, and GMCSF responses to stimulation with either phosphoantigen HMB-PP, IL-12/IL-18, E. coli, or phorbol myristate  and ionomycin. Similar dysfunctional responses were observed in patients with active TB. Surprisingly, neither the γδ phenotype nor its function was associated with plasma markers of inflammation or microbial translocation. Thus, there is significant perturbation of the γδ T-cell population in patients with ESRD, particularly in those with latent TB infection.Copyright © 2017 International Society of Nephrology.

Under biofilm, bacteria are better protected against antibacterial drugs and the immune response, increasing treatment difficulty, as persistent populations recalcitrant to chemotherapy are promoted. Deciphering mechanisms leading to biofilms could, thus, be beneficial to obtain new antibacterial drug candidates. Here, we show that mycobacterial biofilm formation is linked to excess glycerol adaptation and the concomitant establishment of the Crabtree effect. This effect is characterized by respiratory reprogramming, ATP downregulation, and secretion of various metabolites including pyruvate, , succinate, and glutamate. Interestingly, the Crabtree effect was abnormal in a mycobacterial strain deficient for Cpn60.1 (GroEL1). Indeed, this mutant strain had a compromised ability to downregulate ATP and secreted more pyruvate, , succinate, and glutamate in the culture medium. Importantly, the mutant strain had higher intracellular pyruvate and produced more toxic methylglyoxal, suggesting a glycolytic stress leading to growth stasis and consequently biofilm failure. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the link between mycobacterial biofilm formation and the Crabtree effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30772712>The antagonistic effect of Se on the Pb-weakening formation of neutrophil extracellular traps in chicken neutrophils.</a></h2><p>Neutrophils represent an important part of the body's innate  and can resist the invasion of pathogenic microorganisms by releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). In this study, we investigated the toxic effects of lead (Pb) on the release of NETs, the antagonism of selenium (Se) on Pb toxicity and the potential molecular mechanisms. Our model was an in vitro exposure model for the addition of Se, Pb or both in the culture medium and was based on the separation of neutrophils from the peripheral blood of healthy chickens. Phorbol-myristate- (PMA) was used as a stimulant. The scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy results showed that Pb weakened the PMA-induced formation of NETs. Exposure to Pb reduced the expression of the extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathway and the respiratory burst. Exposure to Pb also attenuated the release of Ca in the endoplasmic reticulum mediated by the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R). These are two ways by which Pb decreases the formation of NETs. Pb also attenuates the expression levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and neutrophil elastase (NE), and attenuates histone removal by affecting the expression of different protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. In contrast, Se can reduce the toxic damage caused by Pb. These results indicate that exposure to Pb decreases the formation of NETs, while Se can antagonize the toxicity of Pb to allow the formation of NETs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Using a well-established model of progressive MS triggered by intracranial infection with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), we sought to determine whether dysbiosis induced by oral antibiotics (ABX) administered on pre-symptomatic and symptomatic phases of the disease influences its course. We also addressed the effects of microbiota recolonization after ABX withdrawn in the presence or absence of probiotics. Central and peripheral , plasma  and butyrate levels, axon damage and motor disability were evaluated. The cocktail of ABX prevented motor dysfunction and limited axon damage in mice, which had fewer CD4 and CD8 T cells in the CNS, while gut microbiota recolonization worsened motor function and axonal integrity. The underlying mechanisms of ABX protective effects seem to involve CD4CD39 T cells and CD5CD1d B cells into the CNS. In addition, microglia adopted a round amoeboid morphology associated to an anti-inflammatory gene profile in the spinal cord of TMEV mice administered ABX. The immune changes in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes were modest, yet ABX treatment of mice limited IL-17 production . Collectively, our results provide evidence of the functional relevance of gut microbiota manipulation on the neurodegenerative state and disease severity in a model of progressive MS and reinforce the role of gut microbiota as target for MS treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29546579>The antidiabetic drug metformin blunts NETosis in vitro and reduces circulating NETosis biomarkers in vivo.</a></h2><p>Diabetes is associated with an excess release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and an enhanced NETosis, a neutrophil cell death programme instrumental to anti-microbial defences, but also involved in tissue damage. We herein investigated whether the antidiabetic drug metformin protects against NETosis.We measured NET components in the plasma of patients with pre-diabetes who were randomized to receive metformin or placebo for 2 months. To control for the effect on glucose, we also measured NET components in the plasma of patients with type 2 diabetes before and after treatment with insulin or dapagliflozin. In vitro, we used static and dynamic imaging with advanced live confocal two-photon microscopy to evaluate the effects of metformin on cellular events during NETosis. We examined putative molecular mechanisms by monitoring chromatin decondensation and DNA release in vitro.Metformin, as compared to placebo, significantly reduced the concentrations of NET components elastase, proteinase-3, histones and double strand DNA, whereas glucose control with insulin or dapagliflozin exerted no significant effect. In vitro, metformin prevented pathologic changes in nuclear dynamics and DNA release, resulting in a blunted NETosis in response to phorbol myristate  and calcium influx. Metformin prevented membrane translocation of PKC-βII and activation of NADPH oxidase in neutrophils, both of which diminished the NETosis response.Metformin treatment reduced the concentrations of NET components independently from glucose control. This effect was reproducible in vitro and was related to the inhibitory effect exerted by metformin on the PKC-NADPH oxidase pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894089>Endothelial SIRT6 Is Vital to Prevent Hypertension and Associated Cardiorenal Injury Through Targeting Nkx3.2-GATA5 Signaling.</a></h2><p>Endothelial dysfunction is an important determinant risk factor for the development of hypertension and its complications. Thus, identification of potential therapeutic targets for preventing endothelial dysfunction has major clinical importance. Emerging evidence indicates that epigenetic modifications are closely associated with the regulation of endothelial function. Among them, HDAC (histone deacetylase)-mediated epigenetic processes in vascular homeostasis and cardiovascular disease have attracted much attention. SIRT6 (sirtuin 6) is one member of SIRTs (class III HDAC) that are highly conserved NAD-dependent deacetylases.This study was designed to elucidate the role of SIRT6 in the pathogenesis of hypertension, discover the new targets of SIRT6, and explore related mechanisms on the regulation of endothelial function.The levels of endothelial SIRT6 were significantly reduced in 2 independent hypertension models: desoxycorticosterone /salt-induced and Ang II (angiotensin II)-induced hypertensive mice. Utilizing genetically engineered endothelial-specific SIRT6 knockout (Cre/SIRT6) mice, we found that endothelial-specific deletion of SIRT6 significantly enhanced blood pressure, exacerbated endothelial dysfunction and cardiorenal injury in experimental hypertension. Functionally, SIRT6 has pleiotropic protective actions in endothelial cells, which include promoting endothelium-dependent vasodilatation and vascular NO bioavailability, reducing cellular permeability, ameliorating endothelial senescence and apoptosis, and facilitating autophagy. Mechanistically, SIRT6 induced the expression of GATA5 (GATA-binding protein 5), a novel regulator of blood pressure, through inhibiting Nkx3.2 (NK3 homeobox 2) transcription by deacetylating histone H3K9 (histone H3 lysine 9), thereby regulating GATA5-mediated signaling pathways to prevent endothelial injury. Finally, we provide direct evidence for the therapeutic potential of SIRT6 in desoxycorticosterone /salt-induced hypertensive mice by overexpression of SIRT6 in vivo.This study for the first time demonstrates that SIRT6 prevents hypertension and its complications by maintaining endothelial function. Pharmacological targeting of SIRT6 may be an innovative therapeutic strategy for treating patients with hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30922887>Sequence characterization and expression pattern analysis of six kinds of IL-17 family genes in the Asian swamp eel (Monopterus albus).</a></h2><p>Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is an important cytokine that plays a critical role in the inflammatory response and host defense against extracellular pathogens. In the present study, six novel IL-17 family genes (MaIL-17) were identified by analyzing Asian swamp eel (Monopterus albus) genome. Sequence analysis revealed that the MaIL-17 family genes shared similar features, comprising a signal peptide, an IL-17 superfamily region, and four conserved cysteines. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the MaIL-17 genes were clustered together with their corresponding IL-17 genes from other species. The similarity and identity of all IL-17 family genes indicated that the MaIL-17 genes are conserved among teleosts, while Ma-IL-17D is more conserved than the other Ma-IL-17s. Except for MaIL-17A/F3 and MaIL-17D, all MaIL-17s shared the same genomic structure as the genes from other fish, namely three exons and two introns. The MaIL-17s showed conserved synteny among fish, and we found that the MaIL-17D locus has a more conserved syntenic relationship with the loci from other fish and humans. These results demonstrated that MaIL-17D and human IL-17D might have evolved from a common ancestral gene and subsequently diverged. The analysis of swamp eel reference genes revealed that EEF1A1 (encoding eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1) was an ideal reference gene for accurate real-time qRT-PCR normalization in the swamp eel. The MaIL-17 genes are widely distributed throughout tissues, suggesting that MaIL-17s carry out their biological functions in immune and non-immune tissues compartments. The transcript of Ma-IL17s exhibited different fold changes in head kidney cells in response to Aeromonas veronii phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) challenge, showing that MaIL-17A/F1 has stronger antiviral activities compared with other MaIL-17 family genes, and that MaIL-17A/F3 and MaIL-17A/F2 possess stronger effects against extracellular pathogens compared with the others; however, MaIL-17C2 and MaIL-17D may play vital roles during pathogen infection. The differential immune responses of these genes to Aeromonas veronii, PMA and poly I:C implied distinct mechanisms of host defense against extracellular pathogens.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Symptoms are not observed until the organism colonises the placenta, eventually causing abortion. Infected animals become carriers and will shed the organism in the following oestruses. This process suggests that sex hormones might play an important role in the physiopathology of OEA, affecting the success of chlamydial clearance and also jeopardising the effectiveness of vaccination. However, the mechanisms through which sex hormones are involved in chlamydial pathogenicity remain unclear. The aim of this study, therefore, was to determine the effect of progesterone on the immune response against C. abortus and on the protection conferred by an experimental inactivated vaccine in sheep. Eighteen sheep were ovariectomised and divided into four groups: vaccinated and progesterone-treated (V-PG), vaccinated and non-treated (V-NT), non-vaccinated and non-treated (NV-NT) and non-vaccinated and progesterone-treated sheep (NV-PG). Animals from both PG groups were treated with commercial medroxyprogesterone  impregnated intravaginal sponges before and during the vaccination (V-PG) or just before challenge (NV-PG). The animals from both V groups were subcutaneously immunised with an experimental inactivated vaccine, which was seen to confer high protection in previous studies. All sheep were challenged intratracheally with C. abortus strain AB7 and were sacrificed on day 8 post-infection. Morbidity was measured as the variation in rectal temperature and samples of sera were collected for antibody and cytokine (IFN-γ and IL-10) analysis by commercial ELISA. In addition, lung and lymph node samples were collected for chlamydial detection by qPCR and for histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses. Sheep from the V-PG group showed less severe or no lesions and lower morbidity than the other groups. They also had the highest abundance of regulatory T-cells. The sheep from V-NT also manifested high antibody levels against C. abortus and less severe lesions than those observed in non-vaccinated sheep, which showed high morbidity, low antibody levels and severe lesions, especially in NV-NT. These results confirm the effectiveness of the experimental vaccine employed and suggest that progesterone could enhance the effect.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

A vaccine for this disease is not available but  possesses a giant plasmid pMUM001 that harbours the polyketide synthase (PKS) genes encoding a multi-enzyme complex needed for the production of its unique lipid toxin called mycolactone, which is central to the pathogenesis of Buruli ulcer. We have studied the immunogenicity of enzymatic domains in humans with  disease, their contacts, as well as non-endemic areas controls.Between March 2013 and August 2015, heparinized whole blood was obtained from patients confirmed with Buruli ulcer. The blood samples were diluted 1 in 10 in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium and incubated for 5 days with recombinant mycolactone PKS domains and mycolyltransferase antigen 85A (Ag85A). Blood samples were obtained before and at completion of antibiotic treatment for 8 weeks and again 8 weeks after completion of treatment. Supernatants were assayed for interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin-5 (IL-5) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Responses were compared with those of contacts and non-endemic controls.More than 80% of patients and contacts from endemic areas produced IFN-γ in response to all the antigens except acyl carrier protein type 3 (ACP3) to which only 47% of active Buruli ulcer cases and 71% of contacts responded. The highest proportion of responders in cases and contacts was to load module ketosynthase domain (Ksalt) (100%) and enoylreductase (100%). Lower IL-5 responses were induced in a smaller proportion of patients ranging from 54% after ketoreductase type B stimulation to only 21% with ketosynthase type C (KS C). Among endemic area contacts, the, highest proportion was 73% responding to KS C and the lowest was 40% responding to acyltransferase with  specificity type 2. Contacts of Buruli ulcer patients produced significantly higher IFN-γ and IL-5 responses compared with those of patients to PKS domain antigens and to mycolyltransferase Ag85A of . There was low or no response to all the antigens in non-endemic areas controls. IFN-γ and IL-5 responses of patients improved after treatment when compared to baseline results.The major response to PKS antigen stimulation was IFN-γ and the strongest responses were observed in healthy contacts of patients living in areas endemic for Buruli ulcer. Patients elicited lower responses than healthy contacts, possibly due to the immunosuppressive effect of mycolactone, but the responses were enhanced after antibiotic treatment. A vaccine made up of the most immunogenic PKS domains combined with the mycolyltransferase Ag85A warrants further investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31487233>Free Fatty Acid Receptors in Health and Disease.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids are metabolized and synthesized as energy substrates during biological responses. Long- and medium-chain fatty acids derived mainly from dietary triglycerides, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gut microbial fermentation of the otherwise indigestible dietary fiber, constitute the major sources of free fatty acids (FFAs) in the metabolic network. Recently, increasing evidence indicates that FFAs serve not only as energy sources but also as natural ligands for a group of orphan G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) termed free fatty acid receptors (FFARs), essentially intertwining metabolism and  in multiple ways, such as via inflammation regulation and secretion of peptide hormones. To date, several FFARs that are activated by the FFAs of various chain lengths have been identified and characterized. In particular, FFAR1 (GPR40) and FFAR4 (GPR120) are activated by long-chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, while FFAR3 (GPR41) and FFAR2 (GPR43) are activated by SCFAs, mainly , butyrate, and propionate. In this review, we discuss the recent reports on the key physiological functions of the FFAR-mediated signaling transduction pathways in the regulation of metabolism and immune responses. We also attempt to reveal future research opportunities for developing therapeutics for metabolic and immune disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29105931>Medroxyprogesterone -treated human, primary endometrial epithelial cells reveal unique gene expression signature linked to innate  and HIV-1 susceptibility.</a></h2><p>Medroxyprogesterone  (MPA), a progestin-based hormonal contraceptive designed to mimic progesterone, has been linked to increased human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) susceptibility. Genital epithelial cells (GECs) form the mucosal lining of the female genital tract (FGT) and provide the first line of protection against HIV-1. The impact of endogenous sex hormones or MPA on the gene expression profile of GECs has not been comprehensively documented.Using microarray analysis, we characterized the transcriptional profile of primary endometrial epithelial cells grown in physiological levels of E2, P4, and MPA.Each hormone treatment altered the gene expression profile of GECs in a unique manner. Interestingly, although MPA is a progestogen, the gene expression profile induced by it was distinct from P4. MPA increased gene expression of genes related to inflammation and cholesterol synthesis linked to innate  and HIV-1 susceptibility.The analysis of gene expression profiles provides insights into the effects of sex hormones and MPA on GECs and allows us to posit possible mechanisms of the MPA-mediated increase in HIV-1 acquisition.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Expression of the PI3K isoform is largely restricted to leukocytes and it plays a key role in immune cell development and function. Seletalisib is a novel small-molecule inhibitor of PI3K that was evaluated in biochemical assays, cellular assays of adaptive and innate , and an in vivo rat model of inflammation. Our findings show that seletalisib is a potent, ATP-competitive, and selective PI3K inhibitor able to block protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation following activation of the B-cell receptor in a B-cell line. Moreover, seletalisib inhibited -formyl peptide-stimulated but not phorbol myristate -stimulated superoxide release from human neutrophils, consistent with a PI3K-specific activity. No indications of cytotoxicity were observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or other cell types treated with seletalisib. Findings from cellular assays of adaptive  demonstrated that seletalisib blocks human T-cell production of several cytokines from activated T-cells. Additionally, seletalisib inhibited B-cell proliferation and cytokine release. In human whole blood assays, seletalisib inhibited CD69 expression upon B-cell activation and anti-IgE-mediated basophil degranulation. Seletalisib showed dose-dependent inhibition in an in vivo rat model of anti-CD3-antibody-induced interleukin 2 release. Collectively, these data characterize seletalisib as a selective PI3K inhibitor and potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases driven by dysregulated proinflammatory cytokine secretion.Copyright © 2017 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29324984>Deoxycorticosterone -salt hypertension activates placental growth factor in the spleen to couple sympathetic drive and immune system activation.</a></h2><p>Chronic increase of mineralocorticoids obtained by administration of deoxycorticosterone  (DOCA) results in salt-dependent hypertension in animals. Despite the lack of a generalized sympathoexcitation, DOCA-salt hypertension has been also associated to overdrive of peripheral nervous system in organs typically targeted by blood pressure (BP), as kidneys and vasculature. Aim of this study was to explore whether DOCA-salt recruits immune system by overactivating sympathetic nervous system in lymphoid organs and whether this is relevant for hypertension.To evaluate the role of the neurosplenic sympathetic drive in DOCA-salt hypertension, we challenged splenectomized mice or mice with left coeliac ganglionectomy with DOCA-salt, observing that they were both unable to increase BP. Then, we evaluated by immunofluorescence and ELISA levels of the placental growth factor (PlGF) upon DOCA-salt challenge, which significantly increased the growth factor expression, but only in the presence of an intact neurosplenic sympathetic drive. When PlGF KO mice were subjected to DOCA-salt, they were significantly protected from the increased BP observed in WT mice under same experimental conditions. In addition, absence of PlGF hampered DOCA-salt mediated T cells co-stimulation and their consequent deployment towards kidneys where they infiltrated tissue and provoked end-organ damage.Overall, our study demonstrates that DOCA-salt requires an intact sympathetic drive to the spleen for priming of  and consequent BP increase. The coupling of nervous system and immune cells activation in the splenic marginal zone is established through a sympathetic-mediated PlGF release, suggesting that this pathway could be a valid therapeutic target for hypertension.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

The level of CD8 T-cell activation acts as an immune regulator associated with disease progression. However, little is known about the characteristics of peripheral and tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells in patients with glioma. In this study, we examined the level of CD8 T-cell activation in a group of 143 patients with glioma and determined that peripheral CD3 T cells decreased in accordance with disease severity. The patients' peripheral CD8 T-cell populations were similar to that of healthy donors, and a small amount of CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was identified in glioma tissues. An increase in activated CD8 T cells, characterized as CD38HLA-DR, and their association with disease progression were identified in the patients' peripheral blood and glioma, and shown to display enriched CCR5 and TNFR2 expression levels.  examination of CD38HLA-DRCD8 T cells indicated that this subset of cells displayed stronger secretion of IFN-γ and IL-2 before and after a 6-h stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) and ionomycin (ION) relative to healthy CD38HLA-DRCD8 T cells, indicating the functional feasibility of CD38HLA-DRCD8 T cells. Higher CCL5 protein and mRNA levels were identified in glioma tissues, which was consistent with the immunohistochemistry results revealing both CCL5 and CD38HLA-DRCD8 T cell expression. Patients' CCR5CD38HLA-DRCD8 T cells were further validated and shown to display increases in CD45RACCR7 and T-bet accompanied by substantial CD107-a, IFN-γ, and Granzyme B levels in response to glioma cells.Copyright © 2019 Chen, Wu, Fang, Chen, Feng, Huang, Wei, Fang and Lin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29728958>Comparative compositional analysis of transgenic potato resistant to potato tuber moth (PTM) and its non-transformed counterpart.</a></h2><p>In this study, the compositions of transgenic potatoes (TPs) resistant to potato tuber moth (Phthorimaea operculella) were compared with those of its non-transgenic (NTP) counterparts.

Evaluation of lymphocyte function is a useful tool to monitor the effect of immunosuppressive treatment and predict the prognosis of immune-mediated diseases (e.g., cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infectious diseases). As the lymphocytes have various activities, such as activation, cytotoxicity, and cytokine secretion, it is a challenge to evaluate the function of lymphocytes in clinical practice and the reference intervals (RIs) of lymphocyte function are rarely reported. The present study showed that the secretion of IFN-γ was well correlated with the activation, chemotaxis, and cytotoxicity of CD4, CD8 T cells, and NK cells, which suggests that IFN-γ production can be used as a symbol of lymphocyte function. We therefore created a simple method to detect the function of CD4, CD8 T cells, and NK cells simultaneously according to IFN-γ secretion by using whole blood instead of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We further established the RIs of lymphocyte function (CD4 T cells: 15.31-34.98%; CD8 T cells: 26.11-66.59%; NK cells: 39.43-70.79%) in healthy adults. This method showed good reproducibility for the evaluation of lymphocyte function. The established RIs were suitable for use in other centers based on the validation data. We also validated the RIs in individuals with different immune status, and the results showed that kidney transplant recipients and infants (0-1 year) had a decreased lymphocyte function, whereas T cells in systemic lupus erythematosus patients exhibited an opposite trend. Overall, we have successfully established the RIs of lymphocyte function in healthy adults in a simple way, which might be of important clinical value in the diagnosis, monitoring, and prognosis of immune-related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534365>Malignant ascite-derived extracellular vesicles inhibit T cell activity by upregulating Siglec-10 expression.</a></h2><p> To evade immune defense, cancer cells can employ extracellular vesicles (EVs) to inhibit the anti-tumor activity of lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment. However, the mechanisms and key molecules that mediate the effects of EVs on lymphocytes are unclear.  We used Quantibody Human Cytokine Antibody Array 440 to determine the tumor -related cytokine profile of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) stimulated with EVs derived from peritoneal washes or malignant ascites. We detected 21 upregulated and 27 downregulated proteins, including the immunosuppressive receptors Siglec-10, SLAM, PD-1, and TIM-3.  Flow cytometry analysis of PBLs or ovarian cancer ascites suggested that Siglec-10 expression on CD3+ T cells was higher in ovarian cancer patients than in healthy controls and in the malignant ascites of ovarian cancer patients than in their blood. Moreover, the expression of CD24, the Siglec-10 ligand, was associated with tumor stage and cancer cell metastasis. Finally, compared to the benign peritoneal wash-derived EVs, the malignant EVs significantly upregulated Siglec-10 expression on Jurkat T cells, inhibited the protein kinase C activity induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13- and ionomycin, and impaired the phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 activated by crosslinking with an anti-CD3 antibody.  The EVs secreted by malignant ovarian cells upregulated Siglec-10 expression on T cells and impaired T cell activation in the tumor microenvironment. We believe that a comprehensive understanding of the regulation of Siglec-10 and CD24 by malignant EVs has clinical importance, as it will aid in the development of better immunotherapeutic strategies for ovarian cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28346408>Gut microbial metabolites limit the frequency of autoimmune T cells and protect against type 1 diabetes.</a></h2><p>Gut dysbiosis might underlie the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes.

We found that UV irradiation rapidly increases green fluorescence of DHR123 in cell-free solutions. The intensity of green fluorescence increases with increasing amounts of DHR123 and UV exposure. The fluorescence increase was greater in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI) than DMEM media. The presence of DMSO (0-1.25%, v/v) in RPMI further increases the fluorescence signal. Phosphate buffered solution (PBS) and Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) generate considerable background signal with DHR123, and increasing DMSO concentration greatly increases the fluorescence signal in these buffers. However, after UV irradiation the amount of DHR123 that remains unoxidized generates sufficient fluorescence signal to measure the ROS produced by HO and peroxidase in vitro or Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase-mediated ROS production within HL-60 neutrophils or primary human neutrophils. We conclude that UV irradiation oxidizes DHR123 to generate Rhodamine 123 (R123) green fluorescence signal, and that the R123 present in the culture supernatant could give erroneous results in plate reader assays. However, flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy reliably detect ROS in cells such as neutrophils. Overall, avoiding false-positive results when detecting ROS using DHR123 requires selection of, agonists, the correct buffers, media, cell types, and measurement techniques.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28381553>Functional and biochemical characterization of a T cell-associated anti-apoptotic protein, GIMAP6.</a></h2><p>TPases of munity-ssociated roteins (GIMAPs) are expressed in lymphocytes and regulate survival/death signaling and cell development within the immune system. We found that human GIMAP6 is expressed primarily in T cell lines. By sorting human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and performing quantitative RT-PCR, GIMAP6 was found to be expressed in CD3+ cells. In Jurkat cells that had been knocked down for GIMAP6, treatment with hydrogen peroxide, FasL, or okadaic acid significantly increased cell death/apoptosis. Exogenous expression of GMAP6 protected Huh-7 cells from apoptosis, suggesting that GIMAP6 is an anti-apoptotic protein. Furthermore, knockdown of GIMAP6 not only rendered Jurkat cells sensitive to apoptosis but also accelerated T cell activation under phorbol 12-myristate 13-/ionomycin treatment conditions. Using this experimental system, we also observed a down-regulation of p65 phosphorylation (Ser-536) in GIMAP6 knockdown cells, indicating that GIMAP6 might display anti-apoptotic function through NF-κB activation. The conclusion from the study on cultured T cells was corroborated by the analysis of primary CD3+ T cells, showing that specific knockdown of GIMAP6 led to enhancement of phorbol 12-myristate 13-/ionomycin-mediated activation signals. To characterize the biochemical properties of GIMAP6, we purified the recombinant GIMAP6 to homogeneity and revealed that GIMAP6 had ATPase as well as GTPase activity. We further demonstrated that the hydrolysis activity of GIMAP6 was not essential for its anti-apoptotic function in Huh-7 cells. Combining the expression data, biochemical properties, and cellular features, we conclude that GIMAP6 plays a role in modulating immune function and that it does this by controlling cell death and the activation of T cells.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28698597>Selenoprotein MsrB1 promotes anti-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in macrophages and controls immune response in vivo.</a></h2><p>Post-translational redox modification of methionine residues often triggers a change in protein function. Emerging evidence points to this reversible protein modification being an important regulatory mechanism under various physiological conditions. Reduction of oxidized methionine residues is catalyzed by methionine sulfoxide reductases (Msrs). Here, we show that one of these enzymes, a selenium-containing MsrB1, is highly expressed in immune-activated macrophages and contributes to shaping cellular and organismal immune responses. In particular, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces expression of MsrB1, but not other Msrs. Genetic ablation of MsrB1 did not preclude LPS-induced intracellular signaling in macrophages, but resulted in attenuated induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-10 and the IL-1 receptor antagonist. This anomaly was associated with excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine production as well as an increase in acute tissue inflammation in mice. Together, our findings suggest that MsrB1 controls immune responses by promoting anti-inflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages. MsrB1-dependent reduction of oxidized methionine in proteins may be a heretofore unrecognized regulatory event underlying  and inflammatory disease, and a novel target for clinical applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30336982>MALT1 activation by TRAF6 needs neither BCL10 nor CARD11.</a></h2><p>The MALT1 (Mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1) paracaspase couples antigen receptors on lymphocytes to downstream signaling events. Activation of MALT1 is known to involve stimulus-dependent CBM complex formation, that is, the recruitment of BCL10-bound MALT1 to a CARD-Coiled Coil protein. Beyond this canonical, CBM-dependent mechanism of MALT1 activation, recent studies suggest that MALT1 protease activity may be triggered by alternative mechanisms. For instance, the E3-ligase TRAF6 can activate MALT1 proteolytic function and induce MALT1 auto-cleavage. However, the interplay between CBM and TRAF6 with regard to MALT1 activation has remained incompletely elucidated. Here, by generating CRISPR/Cas9-derived knock-out Jurkat T-cells, we show that TRAF6 was dispensable for CARD11/BCL10-dependent MALT1 activation upon T-cell stimulation. However, ectopically-expressed TRAF6 could induce MALT1 activity in Jurkat T-cells devoid of either CARD11 or BCL10. These data provide unequivocal evidence that TRAF6-mediated MALT1 activation does not require the upstream scaffold CARD11 or the interaction between MALT1 and BCL10. Thus, TRAF6 may be part of a previously unidentified non-canonical pathway that triggers MALT1 protease activity independently of canonical CBM signalosomes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Traditionally, The Southeast Asian population of Indo-Nepal origin uses it to treat asthma, gout, pain, and inflammation. The Ayurvedic action of the plant includes the balancing of Vata-Kapha in the body. Which lead to various ailments related to the circulation of blood and water, digestion, , and skin. Therefore, in-vitro xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibition potential of the extract could be worth to explore prospect in the prevention/treatment of gouty affections of the joints and other diseases.Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potential of Z. armatum fruit (ZAF) has been reported. To date, no scientific study to validate the claim for gout treatment/management has been attempted so far. The present study deals with the xanthine oxidase inhibitory potential of a various extract of ZAF and marker-based high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) standardization of most active fraction.Liquid-liquid partioning of crude methanol extract of the ZAF followed by repeated column chromatography of most active fraction has resulted in the isolation of seven compounds. Five distinct groups of compounds were isolated, purified, and identified. We have investigated the therapeutic action of ZAF in the management of gout through in-vitro assay of XO, a key enzyme involved in gout pathogenesis.Phytochemical investigation of ZAF has resulted in the isolation of seven compounds of diverse nature. It is noteworthy to mention that out of seven, five compounds have shown the xanthine oxidase inhibitory action. The ethyl  fraction was most potent to inhibit XO. The XO inhibitory activity (IC values) of isolated marker chemical was ranging from 5.62 to 41.21 µM. Three compounds viz. acetyl phenyl  (ZA-2), prudomestin (ZA-6), and tambulin (ZA-7) showed the most potent XO inhibitory activity (IC ≈ 6 µM) comparable with a positive control (Allopurinol, IC, 3.38 µM). This is the first validated HPLC-PDA method for simultaneous analysis and accurate quantification of seven compounds (phenolic acid, acetyl phenyl , xylopyranoside, diphenyl ether and three flavones) in ZAF as well as their distribution in other tissues of the plant.Most potent three chemicals (ZA-2, 6 and 7) could be considered as bioactive to ensure the robust quality of the enriched fraction of ZAF with defined XO inhibition potential. Therefore, either single purified component or their enriched fraction could be a better choice for the management of gout than the crude extract of ZAF. Developed HPLC method is suitable for quality assurance analysis and process control of ZAF derived product intended for gout management. XO inhibitory potential exhibited by the characterized compounds validate the traditional use of this ZAF for the treatment of gout. Further, a detailed study is required to assess the effect of ZAF chemicals on serum uric acid and mechanism of XO inhibition.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigated the effects of maternal faecal microbiota orally administered to neonatal piglets after birth on growth performance, selected microbial populations, intestinal permeability and the development of intestinal mucosal immune system. In total, 12 litters of crossbred newborn piglets were selected in this study. Litter size was standardised to 10 piglets. On day 1, 10 piglets in each litter were randomly allotted to the faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and control groups. Piglets in the FMT group were orally administrated with 2ml faecal suspension of their nursing sow per day from the age of 1 to 3 days; piglets in the control group were treated with the same dose of a placebo (0.1M potassium phosphate buffer containing 10% glycerol (vol/vol)) inoculant. The experiment lasted 21 days. On days 7, 14 and 21, plasma and faecal samples were collected for the analysis of growth-related hormones and cytokines in plasma and lipocalin-2, secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), selected microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in faeces. Faecal microbiota transplantation increased the average daily gain of piglets during week 3 and the whole experiment period. Compared with the control group, the FMT group had increased concentrations of plasma growth hormone and IGF-1 on days 14 and 21. Faecal microbiota transplantation also reduced the incidence of diarrhoea during weeks 1 and 3 and plasma concentrations of zonulin, endotoxin and diamine oxidase activities in piglets on days 7 and 14. The populations of Lactobacillus spp. and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and the concentrations of faecal and plasma , butyrate and total SCFAs in FMT group were higher than those in the control group on day 21. Moreover, the FMT piglets have higher concentrations of plasma transforming growth factor-β and immunoglobulin G, and faecal sIgA than the control piglets on day 21. These findings indicate that early intervention with maternal faecal microbiota improves growth performance, decreases intestinal permeability, stimulates sIgA secretion, and modulates gut microbiota composition and metabolism in suckling piglets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29053025>E-Cigarette Use Causes a Unique Innate Immune Response in the Lung, Involving Increased Neutrophilic Activation and Altered Mucin Secretion.</a></h2><p>E-cigarettes have become increasingly popular and little is known about their potential adverse health effects.To determine the effects of e-cigarette use on the airways.Induced sputum samples from cigarette smokers, e-cigarette users, and nonsmokers were analyzed by quantitative proteomics, and the total and individual concentrations of mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B were determined by light scattering/refractometry and labeled mass spectrometry, respectively. Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation rates were also determined for the same groups.E-cigarette users exhibited significant increases in aldehyde-detoxification and oxidative stress-related proteins associated with cigarette smoke compared with nonsmokers. The levels of innate defense proteins associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such as elastase and matrix metalloproteinase-9, were significantly elevated in e-cigarette users as well. E-cigarette users' sputum also uniquely exhibited significant increases in neutrophil granulocyte-related and NET-related proteins, such as myeloperoxidase, azurocidin, and protein-arginine deiminase 4, despite no significant elevation in neutrophil cell counts. Peripheral neutrophils from e-cigarette users showed increased susceptibility to phorbol 12-myristate 13--induced NETosis. Finally, a compositional change in the gel-forming building blocks of airway mucus (i.e., an elevated concentration of mucin MUC5AC) was observed in both cigarette smokers and e-cigarette users.Together, our results indicate that e-cigarette use alters the profile of innate defense proteins in airway secretions, inducing similar and unique changes relative to cigarette smoking. These data challenge the concept that e-cigarettes are a healthier alternative to cigarettes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31190807>NLRP3 inflammasome-activating arginine-based liposomes promote antigen presentations in dendritic cells.</a></h2><p> The NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been proposed as a common mechanism for some adjuvants to boost the immune system, and cationic liposomes were reported to potentially activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Herein, we questioned whether the NLRP3 inflammasome-activating cationic liposomes could promote antigen presentation and be applied as an immune adjuvant. In addition, we aimed to investigate the structure effect of lipid on triggering these immune responses.  A series of structurally similar lipids, consisting of arginine (Arg) head group and varied lengths of alkyl chains or spacers in between were used to prepare cationic liposomes. Lipopolysaccharide-primed human or murine macrophages or phorbol 12-myristate 13--primed THP-1 cells were treated with these liposomes, and interleukin (IL)-1β secretion was measured to quantify the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Lysosome rupture was examined in THP-1 cells by the fluorescence loss of acridine orange, a lysosome dye. Further, chicken ovalbumin (OVA) was loaded on the liposome surface and applied to murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), which activate OT-I and OT-II lymphocytes upon major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I- and class II-mediated antigen presentation, respectively. OT-I and OT-II cell division and IL-2 secretion were measured to evaluate the antigen presentation efficiency. The expressions of MHC molecules and co-stimulatory molecules ie, CD80, CD86, and CD40 on BMDCs were investigated by flow cytometry.  All the liposomes showed size distributions of 80-200 nm and zeta potentials of around 50 mV. A3C14 liposomes, consisting of Arg-C3-Glu2C14 lipids induced the most potent lysosome rupture and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. OVA-A3C14 also exhibited the most potent MHC class I- and class II-mediated antigen presentation in BMDCs without interfering MHC and co-stimulatory molecules.  The hydrophobic moieties of arginine-based liposomes are crucial in stimulating innate immune cells. A3C14 liposomes were non-immunogenic but strongly activated innate immune cells and promoted antigen presentation, and therefore can be applied as immune adjuvants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30897342>Chronic ethanol consumption alters lamina propria leukocyte response to stimulation in a region-dependent manner.</a></h2><p>Chronic heavy alcohol consumption, also referred to as chronic heavy drinking (CHD), results in intestinal injury characterized by increased permeability, dysbiosis, nutrient malabsorption, potentially higher susceptibility to infection, and increased risk of colorectal cancer. However, our understanding of the mechanisms by which CHD results in intestinal damage remains incomplete. Here, we investigated the impact of chronic drinking on transcriptional and functional responses of lamina propria leukocytes (LPLs) isolated from the 4 major gut sections. Although no significant differences were detected between LPLs isolated from the ethanol and control groups at resting state within each major gut section, our analysis uncovered key regional differences in composition and function of LPLs independent of alcohol consumption. However, in response to phorbol myristate  and ionomycin, duodenal LPLs from ethanol-drinking animals generated a dampened response, whereas jejunal and ileal LPLs from ethanol-drinking animals produced a heightened response. Transcriptional responses following stimulation were pronounced in ileal and duodenal LPLs from the ethanol-drinking group but less evident in jejunal and colonic LPLs compared with controls, suggesting a more significant impact of alcohol on these gut regions. The altered intestinal LPL function detected in our study reveals remarkable region specificity and novel insight into potential mechanisms of intestinal injury associated with CHD.-Barr, T., Lewis, S.

Longitudinal changes in cervical  associated with DMPA and combined oral contraceptives (COCs) have not been studied. Cervical samples from 216 HIV seroconverters in Uganda and Zimbabwe with matched samples from 727 HIV-uninfected controls were collected at two quarterly visits before (t - 2, t - 1), at (t0), and two visits following (t + 1, t + 2) HIV seroconversion and corresponding visits for HIV-negative controls. We measured 10 biomarkers of inflammation and  and used generalized linear models to estimate and compare biomarker levels across HIV status, contraceptive, and pregnancy groups. Biomarkers remained relatively stable across visits for controls, while in HIV-infected women cervical  started to change before seroconversion with RANTES and BD-2 increased and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) decreased at t - 1 and continued to change at t0 with ICAM-1 up and IL-8 down and with more biomarkers after seroconversion (IL-1β, IL-6, MIP-3α, VEGF, and IL-1RA down and IL-1RA:IL-1β ratio up). In multivariable analyses, seroconverters had higher BD-2 at t - 1, higher RANTES and lower SLPI from t - 1 through t + 2, and lower IL-8 and IL-1RA at and/or after seroconversion compared to nonseroconverters. Compared to non-HC users, DMPA users had higher RANTES at all visits and lower BD-2 at t - 2 through t0, while COC users and pregnant women had higher IL-8 and SLPI at all visits; COC users also had lower BD-2 preseroconversion; pregnant women had lower RANTES at t0 - t + 2. Longitudinal patterns of cervical  differ between HIV seroconverters and HIV-negative women; seroconverters demonstrate increased RANTES and decreased SLPI starting before and continuing postseroconversion. Furthermore, these patterns are differentially regulated by DMPA, COC, and pregnancy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31282921>Effectiveness of a Bundled Intervention Including Adjunctive Corticosteroids on Outcomes of Hospitalized Patients With Community-Acquired Pneumonia: A Stepped-Wedge Randomized Clinical Trial.</a></h2><p>Community-acquired pneumonia remains a leading cause of hospitalization, mortality, and health care costs worldwide. Randomized clinical trials support the use of adjunctive corticosteroids, early progressive mobilization, antibiotic switching rules, and dietary interventions in improving outcomes. However, it is uncertain whether implementing these interventions will translate into effectiveness under routine health care conditions.To evaluate the effectiveness of a bundle of evidence-supported treatments under conditions of routine care in a representative population hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia.A double-blind, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized clinical trial with 90-day follow-up was conducted between August 1, 2016, and October 29, 2017, in the general internal medicine service at 2 tertiary hospitals in Melbourne, Australia, among a consecutive sample of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. The primary analysis and preparation of results took place between May 14 and November 25, 2018.Treating clinical teams were advised to prescribe prednisolone , 50 mg/d, for 7 days (in the absence of any contraindication) and de-escalate from parenteral to oral antibiotics according to standardized criteria. Algorithm-guided early mobilization and malnutrition screening and treatment were also implemented.Hospital length of stay, mortality, readmission, and intervention-associated adverse events (eg, gastrointestinal bleeding and hyperglycemia).A total of 917 patients were screened, and 816 (351 women and 465 men; mean [SD] age, 76 [13] years) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, with 401 patients receiving the intervention and 415 patients in the control group. An unadjusted geometric mean ratio of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.78-1.16) was observed for the difference in length of stay (days) between the intervention and control groups. Similarly, no significant differences were observed for the secondary outcomes of mortality and readmission, and the results remained unchanged after further adjustment for sex and age. The study reported higher proportions of gastrointestinal bleeding in the intervention group (9 [2.2%]) compared with the controls (3 [0.7%]), with an unadjusted estimated difference in mean proportions of 0.008 (95% CI, 0.005-0.010).This bundled intervention including adjunctive corticosteroids demonstrated no evidence of effectiveness and resulted in a higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Efficacy of individual interventions demonstrated in clinical trials may not necessarily translate into effectiveness when implemented in combination and may even result in net harm.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30359203>Opportunistic bacteria confer the ability to ferment prebiotic starch in the adult cystic fibrosis gut.</a></h2><p>Chronic disruption of the intestinal microbiota in adult cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is associated with local and systemic inflammation, and has been linked to the risk of serious comorbidities. Supplementation with high amylose maize starch (HAMS) might provide clinical benefit by promoting commensal bacteria and the biosynthesis of immunomodulatory metabolites. However, whether the disrupted CF gut microbiota has the capacity to utilise these substrates is not known. We combined metagenomic sequencing,  fermentation, amplicon sequencing, and metabolomics to define the characteristics of the faecal microbiota in adult CF patients and assess HAMS fermentation capacity. Compared to healthy controls, the faecal metagenome of adult CF patients had reduced bacterial diversity and prevalence of commensal fermentative clades.  fermentation models seeded with CF faecal slurries exhibited reduced  levels compared to healthy control reactions, but comparable levels of butyrate and propionate. While the commensal genus  was strongly associated with short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production by healthy microbiota, it was displaced in this role by  1 in the microbiota of CF patients. A subset of CF reactions exhibited enterococcal overgrowth, resulting in lactate accumulation and reduced SCFA biosynthesis. The addition of healthy microbiota to CF faecal slurries failed to displace predominant CF taxa, or substantially influence metabolite biosynthesis. Despite significant microbiota disruption, the adult CF gut microbiota retains the capacity to exploit HAMS. Our findings highlight the potential for taxa associated with the altered CF gut microbiotato mediate prebiotic effects in microbial systems subject to ongoing perturbation, irrespective of the depletion of common commensal clades.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29669281>Differential Reliance on Lipid Metabolism as a Salvage Pathway Underlies Functional Differences of T Cell Subsets in Poor Nutrient Environments.</a></h2><p>T cells compete with malignant cells for limited nutrients within the solid tumor microenvironment. We found that effector memory CD4 T cells respond distinctly from other T cell subsets to limiting glucose and can maintain high levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production in a nutrient-poor environment. Unlike naive (T) or central memory T (T) cells, effector memory T (T) cells fail to upregulate fatty acid synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and reductive glutaminolysis in limiting glucose. Interference of fatty acid synthesis in naive T cells dramatically upregulates IFN-γ, while increasing exogenous lipids in media inhibits production of IFN-γ by all subsets, suggesting that relative ratio of fatty acid metabolism to glycolysis is a direct predictor of T cell effector activity. Together, these data suggest that effector memory T cells are programmed to have limited ability to synthesize and metabolize fatty acids, which allows them to maintain T cell function in nutrient-depleted microenvironments.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

They are ubiquitous environmental contaminants and epidemiological studies suggest that phthalate exposure is associated with development or worsening of airway diseases. Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) is a type of phthalate, found in high concentrations in indoor air, which appears to have a high inflammatory potential. In vitro studies on innate immune cells like macrophages have shown a reduction in phagocytic and antigen-presenting capacity and decreased production of stimuli-induced cytokines after DBP exposure.We aimed to assess how DBP may alter the in vitro cellular and humoral innate immune response to inflammatory stimuli in blood innate immune cells.Human whole blood was stimulated with inflammatory stimuli (lipopolysaccharide (LPS), resiquimod (R848) and phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA)) in the presence or absence of DBP. The expression of surface markers CD16, CD24, CD69 and CD14 on granulocytes and monocytes was quantified by flow cytometry analysis. The release of TNFα, IFNγ, IL8 and IL10 cytokines was measured by ELISA.The presence of DBP reduced the inflammatory stimuli-induced expression of CD24 on neutrophils and eosinophils and CD69 on activated eosinophils, whereas expression of CD16 on neutrophils was increased. DBP also had a dampening effect on the release of pro-inflammatory mediators TNFα and IFNγ in response to the inflammatory stimuli.These responses may reflect an immunosuppressive effect of DBP through impairment of immune cell function.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Epidemiological data show a significant 1.4-fold increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition for DMPA-IM usage, while no such association is shown from limited data for NET-EN. We show that MPA, unlike NET, significantly increases R5-tropic but not X4-tropic HIV-1 replication ex vivo in human endocervical and ectocervical explant tissue from pre-menopausal donors, at physiologically relevant doses. Results support a mechanism whereby MPA, unlike NET, acts via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to increase HIV-1 replication in cervical tissue by increasing the relative frequency of CD4+ T cells and activated monocytes. We show that MPA, unlike NET, increases mRNA expression of the CD4 HIV-1 receptor and CCR5 but not CXCR4 chemokine receptors, via the GR. However, increased density of CD4 on CD3+ cells was not observed with MPA by flow cytometry of digested tissue. Results suggest that DMPA-IM may increase HIV-1 acquisition in vivo at least in part via direct effects on cervical tissue to increase founder R5-tropic HIV-1 replication. Our findings support differential biological mechanisms and disaggregation of DMPA-IM and NET-EN regarding HIV-1 acquisition risk category for use in high risk areas.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30088769>Combining Adhesive Nanostructured Surfaces and Costimulatory Signals to Increase T Cell Activation.</a></h2><p>Adoptive cell therapies are showing very promising results in the fight against cancer.

Here, we sought to develop an effective strategy to expand human iNK T cells for use in cell therapy to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in ASCT.Human iNK T cells were first enriched from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using magnetic-activated cell sorting separation, then co-cultured with dendritic cells in the presence of agonist glycolipids, alpha-galactosylceramide, for 2 weeks.The single antigenic stimulation reliably expanded iNK T cells to an average of 2.8 × 10 per 5 × 10 PBMCs in an average purity of 98.8% in 2 weeks (N = 24). The expanded iNK T cells contained a significantly higher level of CD4 and central memory phenotype (CD45RACD62L) compared with freshly isolated iNK T cells, and maintained their ability to produce both Th-1 (interferon [IFN]γ and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]α) and Th-2 type cytokines (interleukin [IL]-4, IL-5 and IL-13) upon antigenic stimulation or stimulation with Phorbol 12-myristate 13-/ionomycin. Interestingly, expanded iNK T cells were highly autoreactive and produced a Th-2 polarized cytokine production profile after being co-cultured with dendritic cells alone without exogenous agonist glycolipid antigen. Lastly, expanded iNK T cells suppressed conventional T-cell proliferation and ameliorated xenograft GVHD (hazard ratio, 0.1266; P < 0.0001).We have demonstrated a feasible approach for obtaining ex vivo expanded, highly enriched human iNK T cells for use in adoptive cell therapy to prevent GVHD in ASCT.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we investigate the contribution of chromatin state dynamics during NK cell activation by comprehensively analyzing a set of microarray data and two sets of Chromatin Immunoprecipitation-Sequencing (ChIP-seq) data. We find that the expression of several histone demethylases and methyltransferases was influenced upon stimulation. Furthermore, we notice that a series of genes, including PI3KCA, NFATC1and TNFSF9, which play important roles during NK cell activation, were at 'poised' state prior to activation, and that modifications of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 on these promotors were sensitive to stimulation with Phorbol Myristate  (PMA) and Ionomycin (Iono) in the NK92MI cell line. Finally, we demonstrate that a series of small molecule inhibitors, which are specific to H3K4 and H3K27 modification, enhance degranulation or the expression levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α. Our results suggest that the histone modification state has a profound impact on NK cell activation, and provide novel insights into the regulation of NK cellular cytotoxicity and immunoregulatory function by chromatin state dynamics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30452655>The Injectable Contraceptive Medroxyprogesterone  Attenuates Mycobacterium tuberculosis-Specific Host  Through the Glucocorticoid Receptor.</a></h2><p>The effects of the widely used progestin-only injectable contraceptives, medroxyprogesterone  (MPA) and norethisterone  (NET-A), on host susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) are unknown.We recruited human immunodeficiency virus-uninfected females, not taking any contraceptives, from Cape Town, South Africa, to evaluate the effect of MPA, NET-A, and dexamethasone on Mtb containment in monocyte-derived macrophages co-incubated with purified protein derivative (PPD)-driven peripheral blood-derived effector cells.MPA (P < .005) and dexamethasone (P < .01), but not NET-A, significantly attenuated Mtb containment in Mtb-infected macrophages co-cultured with PPD-driven effector cells at physiologically relevant concentrations and in a dose-dependent manner. Antagonizing the glucocorticoid receptor with mifepristone (RU486) abrogated the reduction in Mtb containment. In PPD-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, MPA and dexamethasone, but not NET-A, upregulated (median [interquartile range]) regulatory T cells (5.3% [3.1%-18.2%]; P < .05), reduced CD4+ T-cell interferon-γ (21% [0.5%-28%]; P < .05) and granzyme B production (12.6% [7%-13.5%]; P < .05), and reduced CD8+ perforin activity (2.2% [0.1%-7%]; P < .05). RU486 reversed regulatory T-cell up-regulation and the inhibitory effect on Th1 and granzyme/perforin-related pathways.MPA, but not NET-A, subverts mycobacterial containment in vitro and downregulates pathways associated with protective CD8+- and CD4+-related host  via the glucocorticoid receptor. These data potentially inform the selection and use of injectable contraceptives in tuberculosis-endemic countries.© The Author(s) 2018.

However, its immune-protective properties and antispasmodic effects still need more pharmacological data if the plant will be utilized in herbal and drug formulations. Therefore, the present study determined the capacity of this plant species to modulate nonspecific immune responses and to confirm its antispasmodic activity in vivo in ICR mice.Phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophage, splenic lymphocyte proliferation and plasma lysozyme levels were measured in mice that were immunosuppressed using cyclophosphamide and treated with the ethyl  extract of Portulaca oleracea. In addition, the charcoal meal transit test was used to measure intestinal motility using ethanolic (EtOH), hexane (HEX), and ethyl  (EA) solvent extracts. Phytochemical analysis was undertaken and DPPH scavenging properties of the three solvent extracts were also determined.The EA extract of P. oleracea exhibited immunoactivity through significant increase in phagocytosis and higher proliferative response in splenic lymphocytes. Plasma lysozyme level was also higher in EA-treated mice at high dose but this was not statistically significant. Decreased intestinal motility was also exhibited in mice treated with the three leaf solvent extracts compared to the negative control and the acetylcholine-treated group. The antispasmodic activity of the solvent extracts was comparable to that of the atropine-treated group. Phytochemical analysis showed the presence of tannins in EA extract in addition to alkaloids and steroids. The EtOH and HEX extracts contain alkaloids, steroids and terpenoids. DPPH scavenging activity was highest in the EA extract.The present study showed that the EA extract of P. oleracea leaves ameliorated the immunosuppressive action of cyclophosphamide in mice. The results also indicated that the three solvent extracts of the plant decreased smooth muscle spasms in mice ileum. However, further experiments are warranted to further isolate the plant's immunoactive component. Also, the mechanisms involved in the immunoactivity and antispasmodic properties of P. oleracea deserve full elucidation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Due to severe abnormalities of immune function in a taurine deficient cat, the immune function including adoptive and innate  in taurine-deficient mice have been studied. Previously we demonstrated that B cell function in CSAD KO was reduced in both females and males. However, T cell function was significantly reduced only in females. In this study, we have examined innate  using macrophage activation with LPS or/and IFN-γ and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) activation with phorbol myristate  (PMA). Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, TNF-α and IL-10 as well as nitric oxide (NO) were determined using ELISA and Griess reagent, respectively. Peritoneal macrophages were activated with 1 μg/mL of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or 50 U/mL of IFN-γ. In addition, superoxide anion was measured using peritoneal PMN activated with PMA in the presence and absence of superoxide dismutase. Superoxide anion production in activated PMN from CSAD KO homozygotes (HO) was not significantly different from wild-type (WT) with and without 25 mM taurine. IL-10 and TNF-α production in both female and male CSAD KO were not significantly different. IL-6 and NO were significantly lower only in females as previously observed in Con A-activated cellular proliferation of splenocytes. Cytokine production with 10 mM of taurine was not different, indicating the reduction of NO and IL-6 in females may be due to the absence of the CSAD gene, not due to low taurine concentrations.These data indicate that some measures of innate  were altered in female CSAD mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29725275>TD/GC-MS analysis of volatile markers emitted from mono- and co-cultures of  and  in artificial sputum.</a></h2><p>Infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) can be caused by one or more pathogens. Current methods for identifying these pathogenic microbes often require invasive sampling, and can be time consuming, due to the requirement for prolonged cultural enrichment along with selective and differential plating steps. This results in delays in diagnosis which in such critically ill patients can have potentially life-threatening consequences. Therefore, a non-invasive and timely diagnostic method is required. Detection of microbial volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath is proposed as an alternative method for identifying these pathogens and may distinguish between mono- and poly-microbial infections.To investigate volatile metabolites that discriminate between bacterial mono- and co-cultures.VAP-associated pathogens  and  were cultured individually and together in artificial sputum medium for 24 h and their headspace was analysed for potential discriminatory VOCs by thermal desorption gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.Of the 70 VOCs putatively identified, 23 were found to significantly increase during bacterial culture (i.e. likely to be released during metabolism) and 13 decreased (i.e. likely consumed during metabolism). The other VOCs showed no transformation (similar concentrations observed as in the medium). Bacteria-specific VOCs including 2-methyl-1-propanol, 2-phenylethanol, and 3-methyl-1-butanol were observed in the headspace of axenic cultures of , and methyl 2-ethylhexanoate in the headspace of  cultures which is novel to this investigation. Previously reported VOCs 1-undecene and pyrrole were also detected. The metabolites 2-methylbutyl  and methyl 2-methylbutyrate, which are reported to exhibit antimicrobial activity, were elevated in co-culture only.The observed VOCs were able to differentiate axenic and co-cultures.

Twenty-four Doper × Small Tail Han ewes (6-7 months of age; 29.07 ± 2.28 kg initial body weight) were randomly assigned to one of three treatments for a 47 d feeding period. Treatments consisted of the sheep diet supplemented with 0% ABP-control, 10% ABP, or 15% ABP of the diet (dry matter basis). Blood samples were collected on days 0, 15, 30, and 45 of the feeding period. APB supplementation did not affect growth performance and apparent digestibility of organic matter, crude protein, and acid detergent fibre ( > 0.05). However, ether extract digestibility was decreased in the 10% ABP group and increased in the 15% ABP group ( < 0.001), and both 10% ABP and 15% ABP decreased the neutral detergent fibre digestibility (=0.005). Feeding ABP increased rumen pH ( < 0.001) and ammonia N ( < 0.001) and decreased concentrations of  (=0.007) and propionate (=0.001) which resultantly increased the -to-propionate ratio ( < 0.001) in ruminal fluid.

However, inclusion of dietary 10% ABP decreased concentrations of plasma cholesterol (=0.043). Also, plasma concentrations of low-density lipoprotein decreased on days 30 and 45 (=0.017) of the feeding period. Metabolite concentrations of total protein, albumin, globulin, blood urea N, glucose, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and humoral immune indicators were not affected ( > 0.05) by dietary ABP supplementation. The results suggest that ABP could be reclaimed through dietary inclusion in animal feed since it had beneficial effects on rumen fermentation patterns and lipid metabolism and had no adverse effects on performance and humoral  in sheep.Copyright © 2019 Abedin Abdallah et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28669593>Pathogen-mimicking vaccine delivery system designed with a bioactive polymer (inulin ) for robust humoral and cellular immune responses.</a></h2><p>New and improved vaccines are needed against challenging diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, Ebola, influenza, AIDS, and cancer. The majority of existing vaccine adjuvants lack the ability to significantly stimulate the cellular immune response, which is required to prevent the aforementioned diseases. This study designed a novel particulate based pathogen-mimicking vaccine delivery system (PMVDS) to target antigen-presenting-cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells. The uniqueness of PMVDS is that the polymer used to prepare the delivery system, Inulin  (InAc), activates the innate immune system. InAc was synthesized from the plant polysaccharide, inulin. PMVDS provided improved and persistent antigen delivery to APCs as an efficient vaccine delivery system, and simultaneously, activated Toll-Like Receptor-4 (TLR-4) on APCs to release chemokine's/cytokines as an immune-adjuvant. Through this dual mechanism, PMVDS robustly stimulated both the humoral (>32 times of IgG1 levels vs alum) and the cell-mediated immune responses against the encapsulated antigen (ovalbumin) in mice. More importantly, PMVDS stimulated both cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells of cell-mediated  to provide tumor (B16-ova-Melanoma) protection in around 40% of vaccinated mice and significantly delayed tumor progression in rest of the mice. PMVDS is a unique bio-active vaccine delivery technology with broader applications for vaccines against cancer and several intracellular pathogens, where both humoral and cellular immune responses are desired.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

PAF-R agonists have been shown to modulate tumorigenesis and/or tumor growth in various skin cancer models by suppressing either cutaneous inflammation and/or anti-tumoral adaptive . We have previously shown that a chronic systemic PAF-R agonist administration of mice enhances the growth of subcutaneously implanted melanoma tumors. Conversely, chronic topical applications of a PAF-R agonist suppressed non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) in a topical chemical carcinogenesis model (dimethylbenz[a]anthracene/phorbol 12-myristate 13- (DMBA/PMA)) in-part via anti-inflammatory effects. These results indicate that the context of PAF-R agonist exposure via either chronic cutaneous or systemic administration, result in seemingly disparate effects on tumor promotion. To further dissect the contextual role of PAF-R agonism on tumorigenesis, we chronically administered systemic PAF-R agonist, carbamoyl-PAF (CPAF) to mice under a cutaneous chemical carcinogenesis protocol, recently characterized to initiate both NMSC and melanocytic nevus formation that can progress to malignant melanoma. Our results showed that while systemic CPAF did not modulate melanocytic nevus formation, it enhanced the growth of NMSC tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30389324>Identification of an entomopathogenic bacterium, Xenorhabdus ehlersii KSY, from Steinernema longicaudum GNUS101 and its immunosuppressive activity against insect host by inhibiting eicosanoid biosynthesis.</a></h2><p>Steinernema longicaudum GNUS101, an entomopathogenic nematode, was isolated from soils in Korea. Its internal transcribed space sequence was highly similar to the known S. longicaudum species. Infective juveniles (IJs) of S. longicaudum were highly virulent to lepidopteran and coleopteran insects. Two different bacteria were isolated from the hemolymph of lepidopteran larvae infected with S. longicaudum. They exhibited blue and red colonies on nutrient bromothymol blue agar. The red-colored bacterium was identified as Enterococcus mundtii KHY while the blue-colored bacterium was identified as Xenorhabdus ehlersii KSY based on 16S rRNA sequencing and biochemical characters. The bacterial species showed different growth rates, with X. ehlersii KSY growing more slowly than E. mundtii KHY. Both bacteria were entomopathogenic, but showed differences in suppressing host immune responses. X. ehlersii KSY, but not E. mundtii KHY, showed inhibitory activity against cellular immune responses of Spodoptera exigua larvae including hemocyte-spreading behavior and nodule formation in bacteria-cultured broth. Its immunosuppressive activity was reversed by adding arachidonic acid, an eicosanoid biosynthesis precursor. Furthermore, organic extracts of X. ehlersii KSY using hexane or ethyl  showed inhibitory activity against cellular immune responses of S. exigua larvae. Arachidonic acid addition to S. exigua larvae infected with X. ehlersii significantly rescued the survival rate of target insect. Of the two bacteria isolated from S. longicaudum GNUS101, only X. ehlersii induced immunosuppression of target insect by inhibiting eicosanoid biosynthesis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Although the pathogenesis of NEC is not clear, microbial dysbiosis, with a bloom of the phylum Proteobacteria, has been reported. Antibiotics and the use of H blockers, which affect the gut microbiome, are associated with increased incidence of NEC. In association with dysbiosis, inflammatory processes are upregulated with increased Toll-like receptor signaling, leading to translocation of nuclear factor kappa-β, a transcription factor that induces transcription of various pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Microbial metabolites, short chain fatty acids including  and butyrate, may modulate , inflammation, intestinal integrity and regulate transcription by epigenetic mechanisms. Evaluation of microbiome and metabolome may provide biomarkers for early diagnosis of NEC and microbial therapeutic approaches to correct microbial dysbiosis.© 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30154116>The relationship between sex hormones, the vaginal microbiome and  in HIV-1 susceptibility in women.</a></h2><p>The role of sex hormones in regulating immune responses in the female genital tract has been recognized for decades. More recently, it has become increasingly clear that sex hormones regulate susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections through direct and indirect mechanisms involving inflammation and immune responses. The reproductive cycle can influence simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infections in primates and HIV-1 infection in  cervical tissues from women. Exogenous hormones, such as those found in hormonal contraceptives, have come under intense scrutiny because of the increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections seen in women using medroxyprogesterone , a synthetic progestin-based contraceptive. Recent meta-analyses concluded that medroxyprogesterone  enhanced HIV-1 susceptibility in women by 40%. In contrast, estradiol-containing hormonal contraceptives were not associated with increased susceptibility and some studies reported a protective effect of estrogen on HIV/SIV infection, although the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Recent studies describe a key role for the vaginal microbiota in determining susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections, including HIV-1. While  spp.-dominated vaginal microbiota is associated with decreased susceptibility, complex microbiota, such as those seen in bacterial vaginosis, correlates with increased susceptibility to HIV-1. Interestingly, sex hormones are inherently linked to microbiota regulation in the vaginal tract. Estrogen has been postulated to play a key role in establishing a -dominated microenvironment, whereas medroxyprogesterone  is linked to hypo-estrogenic effects. The aim of this Review is to contribute to a better understanding of the sex-hormone-microbiome- axis, which can provide key information on the determinants of HIV-1 susceptibility in the female genital tract and, consequently, inform HIV-1 prevention strategies.© 2018.

However, the mechanisms that lead to neutrophilia have not been fully established. CD47 is an antiphagocytic molecule that promotes neutrophil recruitment.Blood was collected from 50 treatment-naive patients with advanced NSCLC and from 25 healthy subjects. The frequency of CD66b cells and the expression of CD47 were determined by flow cytometry. Neutrophil apoptosis was determined by 7-amino-actinomycin D/Annexin V-APC staining. Phagocytosis was assessed by flow cytometry. Reactive oxygen species production after phorbol 12-myristate 13- treatment was quantified by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein fluorescence. Pro-inflammatory plasma cytokines were quantified using a cytometric bead array assay.The percentage of circulating neutrophils was significantly higher in patients than in controls (P<0.001). Patient-derived neutrophils had a higher oxidative potential than those of controls (P=0.0286). The number of neutrophils in late apoptosis/necrosis was lower in patients than in controls (P=0.0317). Caspase 3/7 activation was also lower in patients than in controls (P=0.0079). CD47 expression in whole-blood samples and in the neutrophil fraction was higher in NSCLC patients than in controls (P=0.0408 and P<0.001). Patient-derived neutrophils were phagocytosed at a lower rate than those of controls (P=0.0445). CD47 expression in neutrophils negatively correlated with their ingestion by macrophages (P=0.0039). High CD47 expression was associated with a lower overall survival.Increased CD47 expression on the surface of neutrophils was associated with a delay in neutrophil apoptosis and with an impairment in their phagocytic clearance by macrophages, suggesting that CD47 overexpression may be one of the underlying mechanisms leading to neutrophilia in NSCLC patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30641185>Host defense peptide LEAP-2 contributes to monocyte/macrophage polarization in barbel steed (Hemibarbus labeo).</a></h2><p>The liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP-2) plays a vital role in host  against pathogenic organisms. In the present study, cDNA of the LEAP-2 gene was cloned and sequenced from the barbel steed (Hemibarbus labeo). The predicted amino acid sequence of the barbel steed LEAP-2 comprises a signal peptide and a prodomain, which is followed by the mature peptide. Sequence analysis revealed that barbel steed LEAP-2 belongs to the fish LEAP-2A cluster and that it is closely related to zebrafish LEAP-2A. We found that barbel steed LEAP-2 transcripts were expressed in a wide range of tissues, with the highest mRNA levels detected in the liver. In response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment, LEAP-2 was significantly upregulated in the liver, head kidney, spleen, gill, and mid intestine. A chemically synthesized LEAP-2 mature peptide exhibited selective antimicrobial activity against several bacteria in vitro. Moreover, LEAP-2, alone or in combination with LPS or phorbol 12-myristate 13-, strongly induced a pro-inflammatory reaction in barbel steed monocytes/macrophages (MO/MФ), involving the induction of iNOS activity, respiratory burst, and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-1β.

It represents an important defence against the environment and previous studies have reported the presence of different substances involved in immune defence responses in it. The aim of the present work was to characterize skin mucus protease activity by zymography and esterase activity of the subfamily of carboxylesterases in three species of interest for aquaculture: gilthead sea bream, sea bass and meagre. Mucus antioxidant power was also determined by adapting ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) analysis. As a result of these non-specific immune defence parameters, we compared the antibacterial capacity of skin mucus in these species via in vitro dual bacteria strains-skin mucus co-culture growths. We used Pseudomonas anguilliseptica and Vibrio anguillarum as marine pathogenic bacteria and Escherichia coli as non-pathogenic. For each fish species, in the respective zymograms, we determined a pattern of proteolytic digestion bands. A high-molecular-weight band (around 200 kDa; H-band) was evident in sea bream and sea bass, and showed chymotrypsin activity. One or two intermediate-molecular-weight bands (around 75 kDa; I-bands) with non-trypsin and non-chymotrypsin activity, and putatively with metalloprotease activity, were evident in all species. Finally, low-molecular-weight bands (between 14 and 30 kDa; L-bands) showed distinct patterns for each species and matched trypsin activity. Despite the conservative pattern of digestion bands, the levels of total proteolytic activity (TPA) were 5 and 10 times higher in meagre than in sea bass and sea bream, respectively. In parallel, three carboxylesterase activities were detected in the mucus of the three fish species, using myristate (pNPM-CE activity), butyrate (pNPB-CE activity) and  (pNPA-CE activity) as substrates. Both pNPB-CE and pNPA-CE were the most abundant in fish mucus, and meagre was again the species with the highest levels. In contrast, the antioxidant power of meagre skin mucus was the lowest. We established the capacity of skin mucus to block or limit bacterial growth (lytic activity) using 24 h growth curves. The log-growth phase of V. anguillarum was strongly blocked by sea bream and meagre mucus for a few hours; but not by sea bass mucus. However, if mucus was not renewed, log-growth was at the end of 24 h studied period. For its part, P. anguilliseptica growth curve was delayed by the three mucus types during the entire growth period. Only meagre achieved lytic activity against E. coli growth. All parameters studied here will be of a great interest as non-invasive bioindicators of non-specific immune defences in fish skin mucus.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Sipuleucel-T) or in vivo, for stimulating cellular  has been a leading approach for cancer vaccines. We have rationally engineered a nanoparticle (NP)-based delivery system for vaccines (InAc-NPs) using inulin  (InAc) as the polymer to target DCs. The material and the antigen-encapsulated InAc-NPs (∼190 nm in diameter) were characterized for their physicochemical properties. As a potent vaccine adjuvant, InAc-NPs activated TLR4 on multiple immune cells, including DCs and primary swine and human cells, to secrete various cytokines as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, InAc-NPs promoted the maturation of DCs as observed by a decreased phagocytic ability and enhanced capability to activate various maturation markers (MHC-I, MHC-II, CD40, and CD80) quantified using flow cytometry. In mice, the InAc-NPs produced strong serum antibody titers (total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a) against the encapsulated antigen (ovalbumin) similar to complete Freund's adjuvant. Additionally, as a dose-sparing delivery system, antigen delivered through InAc-NPs generated higher antibody titers (IgG1, 1.57 times; IgG-total, 1.66 times; and IgG2a, 29.8 times) even at 100 times less antigen dose. High amounts of cytokines representing both humoral (IL4 and IL10) and cell-mediated (IL2 and IFN-γ) immunities were secreted from splenocytes of mice immunized with InAc-NPs. Importantly, InAc-NPs provided complete protection in 100% of the vaccinated mice from metastasis of intravenously injected melanoma cells (B-F) to lungs. In addition, the InAc-NPs were cleared from the injection site within 30 h of injection (in vivo imaging) and displayed no toxicity at the injection site (histology). The current study demonstrates that the multifunctional InAc-based nanovaccine delivery system has potential applications in cancer immunotherapy and delivering vaccines against various infectious diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30348790>Paracrine costimulation of IFN-γ signaling by integrins modulates CD8 T cell differentiation.</a></h2><p>The cytokine IFN-γ is a critical regulator of immune system development and function. Almost all leukocytes express the receptor for IFN-γ, yet each cell type elicits a different response to this cytokine. Cell type-specific effects of IFN-γ make it difficult to predict the outcomes of the systemic IFN-γ blockade and limit its clinical application, despite many years of research. To better understand the cell-cell interactions and cofactors that specify IFN-γ functions, we focused on the function of IFN-γ on CD8 T cell differentiation. We demonstrated that during bacterial infection, IFN-γ is a dominant paracrine trigger that skews CD8 T cell differentiation toward memory. This skewing is preferentially driven by contact-dependent T cell-T cell (T-T) interactions and the localized IFN-γ secretion among activated CD8 T cells in a unique splenic microenvironment, and is less sensitive to concurrent IFN-γ production by other immune cell populations such as natural killer (NK) cells. Modulation of CD8 T cell differentiation by IFN-γ relies on a nonconventional IFN-γ outcome that occurs specifically within 24 hours following infection. This is driven by IFN-γ costimulation by integrins at T-T synapses, and leads to synergistic phosphorylation of the proximal STAT1 molecule and accelerated IL-2 receptor down-regulation. This study provides evidence of the importance of context-dependent cytokine signaling and gives another example of how cell clusters and the microenvironment drive unique biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31058160>The Effects of Vegetarian and Vegan Diets on Gut Microbiota.</a></h2><p>The difference in gut microbiota composition between individuals following vegan or vegetarian diets and those following omnivorous diets is well documented. A plant-based diet appears to be beneficial for human health by promoting the development of more diverse and stable microbial systems. Additionally, vegans and vegetarians have significantly higher counts of certain -related operational taxonomic units compared to omnivores. Fibers (that is, non-digestible carbohydrates, found exclusively in plants) most consistently increase lactic acid bacteria, such as , and , and reduce  and  species. Polyphenols, also abundant in plant foods, increase  and , which provide anti-pathogenic and anti-inflammatory effects and cardiovascular protection. High fiber intake also encourages the growth of species that ferment fiber into metabolites as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including , propionate, and butyrate. The positive health effects of SCFAs are myriad, including improved  against pathogens, blood-brain barrier integrity, provision of energy substrates, and regulation of critical functions of the intestine. In conclusion, the available literature suggests that a vegetarian/vegan diet is effective in promoting a diverse ecosystem of beneficial bacteria to support both human gut microbiome and overall health.

The results indicated that optimal SB supplementation improved the fish growth performance (percent weight gain, specific growth rate, feed intake and feed efficiency) and intestinal growth and function (intestine weight, intestine length, intestinal somatic index, folds height, trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase and amylase activities), increased beneficial bacteria lactobacillus amount and butyrate concentration, decreased baneful bacteria Aeromonas and Escherichia coli amounts, reduced  and propionate concentrations, elevated lysozyme and acid phosphatase activities, increased complement (C3 and C4) and immunoglobulin M contents, and up-regulated β-defensin-1 (rather than DI), hepcidin, liver expressed antimicrobial peptide 2B (LEAP-2B) (except LEAP-2A), Mucin2, interleukin 10 (IL-10), IL-11 (rather than PI), transforming growth factor β1 (rather than PI), transforming growth factor β2 (rather than PI), IL-4/13A, IL-4/13B and inhibitor of κBα (IκBα) mRNA levels, whereas it down-regulated tumor necrosis factor α, interferon γ2, IL-1β (rather than PI), IL-6, IL-8, IL-15 (rather than PI), IL-17D (rather than PI), IL-12p35, IL-12p40 (rather than PI or MI), nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-κB p65) (except NF-κB p52), c-Rel (rather than PI or MI), IκB kinase β (IKKβ) (rather than PI), IKKγ (except IKKα), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and MAPK kinase 6 mRNA levels in three intestinal segments of young grass carp (P < 0.05), suggesting that SB supplementation improves growth and intestinal immune function of fish. Furthermore, according to the positive effect, MSB was superior to PSB on improving growth and enhancing intestinal immune function of fish, and based on feed efficiency of young grass carp, the efficacy of MSB was 3.5-fold higher than that of PSB. Finally, based on percent weight gain, protecting fish against enteritis morbidity and lysozyme activity, the optimal SB supplementation (MSB as SB source) of young grass carp were estimated to be 160.8, 339.9 and 316.2 mg kg diet, respectively.Copyright © 2017.

The NET mechanism is not only an effective tool for combating pathogens, but is also associated with diseases. Therefore, NETs are a potential target for combating pathologies, such as cystic fibrosis and thrombosis. We investigated the potential of nanoparticles, which were modified with α2,8-linked sialic acid chains, to modulate NET release during phorbol myristate  stimulation. Interestingly, when these nanoparticles were applied, the formation of reactive oxygen species was partly inhibited and the release of NET was counteracted. However, although the release of NET fibers was prevented, the nuclei still lost their characteristic segmented structure and became swollen, indicating that only the release, and not complete activation was suppressed. Intriguingly, coincubation of α2,8-sialylated particles with free sialic acid chains prevented the outlined inhibitory effects. Thus, the sialic acid chains must be attached to a linker molecule to generate an active bioconjugate that is able to inhibit the release of NET.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30158075>Facilitating THP-1 macrophage studies by differentiating and investigating cell functions in polystyrene test tubes.</a></h2><p>Macrophage cell lines are a useful model to explore the properties of primary macrophages. However, a major limitation in the use of these cells is that when they are differentiated, they become adherent and hence present with the same limitation as natural macrophages. The cells need to be detached and are often subjected to detachment techniques such as detachment buffers containing proteolytic enzymes or scraping with a rubber 'policeman'. These steps are time-consuming, reduce cell yields as well as cell viability and function. We have therefore investigated the possibility of differentiating the human macrophage THP-1 cell line in polystyrene FACS tubes to enable cells to be directly used for investigations by flow cytometry. Here we demonstrate that when the human macrophage cell line THP-1 are cultured in FACS tubes with phorbol myristate  added, they undergo differentiation into macrophages, assessed morphologically and by autofluorescence expression, in a similar manner to those cultured in tissue culture dishes. The cells can be readily washed and adjusted in concentration by centrifugation in the same tubes and can be directly tested for expression of cell surface markers and function by flow cytometry. This avoids the use of either detachment reagents or physical cell scraping. Consequently, we showed that the tube culture method results in increased cell yield and viability compared to those subjected to detachment procedures. The tube method generated functional macrophages which expressed the complement receptors, CR3 and CR4, and effectively phagocytosed complement opsonised Staphylococcus aureus via these receptors.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to this indirect method, fluorescence assays have been described for the assessment of in vitro cell‑mediated cytotoxicity. In the present study, target cells were stained with 5‑(and‑6)‑carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE), which is a stable integrated fluorescent probe that allows target and effector cells to be distinguished from one another. Staining of target THP‑1 cells with 8 µM CFSE revealed high and stable loading of fluorescence and no effect of the viability of cells. After 4 h of in vitro co‑culture between γδ T cells and CFSE‑labeled infected or uninfected THP‑1 cells, staining with propidium iodide (PI) was performed to distinguish between vital and dead cells. During sample acquisition, target cells were gated on the CFSE positivity and examined for cell death based on the uptake of PI. CFSE and PI double positive cells were recognized as the dead target cells. The percentage of cytotoxicity in the CFSE‑gated cell population was calculated by subtracting the value obtained for non‑specific PI‑positive target cells, which was measured in a control group that did not contain effector cells. The present study describes a simple and convenient assay that is based on the direct quantitative and qualitative analysis of cell damage at a single cell level utilizing a two‑color flow cytometric assay. In conclusion, the flow cytometric‑based assay described in the current study is a simple, sensitive and reliable tool to determine the cytolytic activity of γδ T lymphocytes against mycobacteria. Therefore, the present study may provide valuable information concerning the methods employed to investigate the function of γδ T cells and potentially other lymphocyte subsets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30211234>Tributyrin Supplementation Protects Immune Responses and Vasculature and Reduces Oxidative Stress in the Proximal Colon of Mice Exposed to Chronic-Binge Ethanol Feeding.</a></h2><p>Excessive ethanol consumption causes adverse effects and contributes to organ dysfunction. Ethanol metabolism triggers oxidative stress, altered immune function, and gut dysbiosis. The gut microbiome is known to contribute to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, and disturbances are associated with pathology. A consequence of gut dysbiosis is also alterations in its metabolic and fermentation byproducts. The gut microbiota ferments undigested dietary polysaccharides to yield short-chain fatty acids, predominantly , propionate, and butyrate. Butyrate has many biological mechanisms of action including anti-inflammatory and immunoprotective effects, and its depletion is associated with intestinal injury. We previously showed that butyrate protects gut-liver injury during ethanol exposure. While the intestine is the largest immune organ in the body, little is known regarding the effects of ethanol on intestinal immune function. This work is aimed at investigating the effects of butyrate supplementation, in the form of the structured triglyceride tributyrin, on intestinal innate immune responses and oxidative stress following chronic-binge ethanol exposure in mice. Our work suggests that tributyrin supplementation preserved immune responses and reduced oxidative stress in the proximal colon during chronic-binge ethanol exposure. Our results also indicate a possible involvement of tributyrin in maintaining the integrity of intestinal villi vasculature disrupted by chronic-binge ethanol exposure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30905492>A novel RORγt inhibitor is a potential therapeutic agent for the topical treatment of psoriasis with low risk of thymic aberrations.</a></h2><p>Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt) has critical roles in the development, maintenance and function of interleukin (IL)-17-producing cells and is a highly attractive target for the treatment of IL-17-mediated autoimmune disease, particularly psoriasis. On the other hand, RORγt is also critical for controlling apoptosis during thymopoiesis, and genetic RORγt ablation or systematic RORγt inhibition cause progressive thymic aberrations leading to T cell lymphomas.We investigated whether topical administration of our novel RORγt inhibitor, S18-000003 has therapeutic potential for psoriasis with low risk of thymic aberrations.We evaluated the effect of topical S18-000003 on psoriasis-like skin inflammation and influence on the thymus in a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13--induced K14.Stat3C mouse psoriasis model.S18-000003 markedly inhibited the development of psoriatic skin inflammation via suppression of the IL-17 pathway. In the skin, S18-000003 suppressed all subsets of IL-17-producing cells that we previously identified in this psoriasis model: Th17 cells, Tc17 cells, dermal γδ T cells, TCR cells that probably included innate lymphoid cells, and CD4CD8 double-negative αβ T cells. Notably, neither reduction of CD4CD8 double-positive thymocytes nor dysregulation of cell cycling was observed in S18-000003-treated mice, even at a high dose.Our topically administered RORγt inhibitor is a potential therapeutic agent for psoriasis with low risk of thymic lymphoma.Copyright © 2019 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

The physiologic stress response of fish has most often been linked to the reduced performance of the immune system, with a few exceptions where the immune system is activated. In this report, we tested the hypothesis that oxidative burst activity levels in juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) are altered when the fish is presented with a stressor. Fish were subjected to a stressor for 3 h and then allowed to recover for 20 h following the stressor. Plasma and spleens were collected from euthanized fish before the stressor, at the end of a 3 h stressor, and 23 h after the start of the experiment. Plasma was held at -80 °C until cortisol radioimmunoassay analysis was performed to confirm stress. Spleens were held in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium overnight and analyzed the day following collection. Oxidative burst activity was measured in splenic leukocytes after being stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-. We found a significant increase in activated oxidative burst from fish subjected to the stressor as compared to unstressed fish. Speculation is given to ACTH being the leukocyte priming agent in this experiment rather than the cortisol itself.Copyright © 2018.

It is estimated that approximately 75% of treatment-resistant hypertension cases have an underlying OSA. Exploration of the gut microbiome is a new advance in medicine that has been linked to many comorbid illnesses, including SH and OSA. Here, we will review the literature in SH and gut dysbiosis, OSA and gut dysbiosis, and whether gut dysbiosis is common in both conditions.We reviewed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, including PubMed and PubMed Central. We identified a total of 230 articles. The literature search was conducted using the phrase "obstructive sleep apnea and gut dysbiosis." Only original research articles were included. This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis, however, can cause a state of low-grade inflammation through damage to the gut wall barrier resulting in "leaky gut." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH.Gut dysbiosis seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension. Reversing gut dysbiosis at an early stage through prebiotics and probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation combined with positive airway pressure therapy may open new horizons of treatment to prevent SH. More studies are needed in humans to elicit the effect of positive airway pressure therapy on gut dysbiosis.© 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30098126>The effects of dietary supplementation with inulin and inulin-propionate ester on hepatic steatosis in adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>The short chain fatty acid (SCFA) propionate, produced through fermentation of dietary fibre by the gut microbiota, has been shown to alter hepatic metabolic processes that reduce lipid storage. We aimed to investigate the impact of raising colonic propionate production on hepatic steatosis in adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Eighteen adults were randomized to receive 20 g/d of an inulin-propionate ester (IPE), designed to deliver propionate to the colon, or an inulin control for 42 days in a parallel design. The change in intrahepatocellular lipid (IHCL) following the supplementation period was not different between the groups (P = 0.082), however, IHCL significantly increased within the inulin-control group (20.9% ± 2.9% to 26.8% ± 3.9%; P = 0.012; n = 9), which was not observed within the IPE group (22.6% ± 6.9% to 23.5% ± 6.8%; P = 0.635; n = 9). The predominant SCFA from colonic fermentation of inulin is , which, in a background of NAFLD and a hepatic metabolic profile that promotes fat accretion, may provide surplus lipogenic substrate to the liver. The increased colonic delivery of propionate from IPE appears to attenuate this -mediated increase in IHCL.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29860962>Feeding corn grain steeped in citric acid modulates rumen fermentation and inflammatory responses in dairy goats.</a></h2><p>Cereal grains treated with organic acids were proved to increase ruminal resistant starch and can relieve the risk of ruminal acidosis. However, previous study mainly focussed on acid-treated barley, the effects of organic acid-treated corn is still unknown. The objectives of this study were to evaluate whether feeding ground corn steeped in citric acid (CA) would affect ruminal pH and fermentation patterns, milk production and innate  responses in dairy goats. Eight ruminally cannulated Saanen dairy goats were used in a crossover designed experiment. Each experimental period was 21 day long including 14 days for adaption to new diet and 7 days for sampling and data collection. The goats were fed high-grain diet contained 30% hay and 70% corn-based concentrate. The corn was steeped either in water (control) or in 0.5% (wt/vol) CA solution for 48 h. Goats fed CA diet showed improved ruminal pH status with greater mean and minimum ruminal pH, and shorter (P&lt;0.05) duration of ruminal pH&lt;5.6 and less area of ruminal pH&lt;5.6, 5.8 and 6.0. Concentration of total volatile fatty acid and molar proportion of propionate were less but the molar proportion of  was greater (P&lt;0.05) in goats fed the CA diet than the control diet. Concentration of ruminal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was lower (P&lt;0.05) and that of lactic acid also tended (P&lt;0.10) to be lower in goats fed CA than the control. Although dry matter intake, actual milk yield, yield and content of milk protein and lactose were not affected, the milk fat content and 4% fat-corrected milk tended (P&lt;0.10) to be greater in goats fed CA diet. For the inflammatory responses, peripheral LPS did not differ, whereas the concentration of LPS binding protein and serum amyloid A tended (P&lt;0.10) to be less in goats fed CA diet. Similarly, goats fed CA diet had less (P&lt;0.05) concentration of haptoglobin and tumour necrosis factor. These results indicated that feeding ground corn treated with CA effectively improved ruminal pH status, thus alleviated the risk of ruminal acidosis, reduced inflammatory response, and tend to improve milk yield and milk fat test.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29427722>Effect of Argemone mexicana active principles on inhibiting viral multiplication and stimulating immune system in Pacific white leg shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei against white spot syndrome virus.</a></h2><p>Argemone mexicana called as Mexican prickly poppy is a species of poppy found in Mexico and now widely naturalized in many parts of the world with broad range of bioactivities including anthelmintic, cures lepsory, skin-diseases, inflammations and bilious fevers. Plant parts of A. mexicana were serially extracted with hexane, ethyl , methanol and performed antiviral and immunostimulant screening against WSSV and Vibrio harveyi respectively. The control groups succumbed to death 100% within three days, whereas the mortality was significantly (P < 0.5) reduced to 17.43 and 7.11 in the ethyl  extracts of stem and root treated shrimp group respectively. The same trend was reflected in the immunostimulant screening also. Different diets were prepared by the concentrations of 100 (AD-1), 200 (AD-2), 300 (AD-3) and 400 (AD-4) mg kg using A. mexicana stem and root ethyl  extracts and fed to Pacific white leg shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei weighed about 9.0 ± 0.5 g for 30 days. The control groups fed with the normal diets devoid of A. mexicana extracts. The antiviral screening results revealed that, the ethyl  extract of the stem and root were effectively suppressed the WSSV and it reflected in the lowest cumulative mortality of treated shrimps. After termination of feeding trials, group of shrimps from control and each experimental group were challenged with virulent WSSV by intramuscular (IM) injection and studied cumulative mortality, molecular diagnosis by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR), biochemical, haematological and immunological parameters. Control group succumbed to 100% death within four days, whereas the survival was significantly (P < 0.001) increased to 30, 45, 75 and 79% in AD1, AD-2, AD-4 and AD-5 diets fed shrimp groups respectively. qRT PCR results with positive correlation analysis revealed that, the WSSV copies were gradually decreased when increasing the A. mexicana extracts in the diets. The highest concentrations (300 and 400 mg g) of A. mexicana extracts in the diets helped to reduce the protein level significantly (P < 0.05) after WSSV challenge. The diets AD-3 and AD-4 also helped to decrease the coagulation time of maximum 64-67% from control groups and maintained the normal level of total haemocyte, oxyhaemocyanin level after WSSV challenge.

Methods Using phorbol myfismte  (PMA)/ionomycin, we stimulated the peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro from 52 kidney transplant recipients, including 22 ones with acute rejection (AR) and 30 with stable allograft function (STA). Eight hours later, we detected the expressions of IL-2 and IL-6 in cell culture supernatant by flow cytometric microcarrier assay. IL-2 and IL-6 expressions were compared between in the stimulated cell culture supernatant and in the unstimulated plasma, as well as between the two groups to evaluate the ability of the method predicting the acute rejection. Results The expressions of IL-2 and IL-6 in the AR group were significantly higher than those in the STA group after the peripheral blood lymphocytes were stimulated. In both of the groups, the expressions of IL-2 and IL-6 in stimulated lymphocyte culture supernatants were significantly higher than those in the unstimulated plasma. The sensitivity and specificity of combined IL-2 and IL-6 detection in stimulated lymphocyte culture supernatants for predicting the acute rejection were 81.8% and 90%, respectively, which were higher than the individual sensitivity and specificity.

Ewes lambing on poor-quality dry pasture in autumn in Western Australia are at risk of being deficient in vitamin E and selenium at lambing thus predisposing their lambs to deficiencies and increasing the risk of infection and disease. This study tested the hypotheses that (i) supplementation of autumn-lambing ewes with vitamin E plus selenium in late gestation will increase the concentrations of vitamin E and selenium in plasma in the ewe and lamb and (ii) that the increased concentrations of vitamin E and selenium in plasma in the lambs will improve their innate and adaptive immune responses and thus survival. Pregnant Merino ewes were divided into a control group (n=58) which received no supplementation or a group supplemented with vitamin E plus selenium (n=55). On days 111, 125 and 140 of pregnancy ewes in the vitamin E plus selenium group were given 4 g all-rac-α-tocopherol  orally. On day 111 the ewes were also given 60 mg of selenium as barium selenate by subcutaneous injection. The concentrations of α-tocopherol and selenium were measured in ewes and/or lambs from day 111 of pregnancy to 14 weeks of age±10 days (weaning). Immune function of the lamb was assessed by analysing the numbers and phagocytic capacities of monocytes and polymorphonuclear leucocytes and plasma IgG and anti-tetanus toxoid antibody concentrations between birth and 14 weeks of age±10 days. Maternal supplementation with vitamin E plus selenium increased the concentration of α-tocopherol in plasma (1.13 v. 0.67 mg/l; P<0.001) and selenium in whole blood (0.12 v. 0.07 mg/l; P<0.01) of the ewes at lambing compared with controls.

It showed that the types and concentrations of the polymers and their interactions with the coformers had significant effects on the dissolution and permeation of the FFA cocrystals. The role of PVP as a stabilizing agent was not altered in spite of its interaction with the coformer of NIC or TP, which was supported by the proportional flux rate of FFA to the dissolution performance parameter (DPP). With an appropriate PVP concentration, the maximal flux rate of FFA could be obtained for a given FFA cocrystal. The situation was complicated in the presence of PVP-VA. The role of PVP-VA could change because of its association with the coformers, i.e., from a stabilizing agent to a solubilization agent. In addition, PVP-VA reduced the flux rate of FFA, in contrast to its DPP for FFA cocrystals. Finally, H NMR provided evidence regarding the molecular interactions between FFA, coformers, and polymers at the atomic level and gave insight into the mechanism underlying the supersaturated solution and subsequent permeation behavior of the cocrystals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30339797>Detection of activated neutrophils by reactive oxygen species production using a hematology analyzer.</a></h2><p>Neutrophils are recruited to infection sites and kill bacteria by phagocytosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. It has been reported that vacuoles are present in neutrophils that produce ROS and are present in large numbers in blood smears of patients with bacterial infections. The leukocyte differentiation function on the Sysmex automated hematology analyzer classifies leukocytes by flow cytometry.

Flow cytometry analysis of the PMN fractions revealed that the cells in this new cluster were CD16b- and APF-positive, indicating that the cells were activated neutrophils that produced ROS. CLSM and EM findings revealed that ROS production occurred in the cytoplasm and that the activated neutrophils contained some vacuole-like structures of vacuoles or invagination of cell membrane. Vacuole-like Sstructures were found within the cytoplasm of neutrophils producing ROS. These neutrophils were detected as an independent cluster in the eosinophil area with higher SSC intensity than that shown by neutrophils in the traditional cluster on the white blood cell differentiation scattergram, likely because the vacuole-like structures increased the SSC intensity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Public demand to reduce the use of sub-therapeutic antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) in poultry feeding has resulted in greater adoption of antibiotic-free poultry production systems. There is a need to understand the effects of AGP removal from poultry feed on gut microbiota and its impact on prevalence of foodborne pathogens. The effect of antibiotic withdrawal from poultry feed on gut microbial community, host performance and , and prevalence of Salmonella and Campylobacter was evaluated. Birds were raised on three phase diets (starter [d0-22], grower [d23-35] and finisher [d36-42]) with and without bacitracin dimethyl salicyclate (BMD). At early growth stage, bird performance was improved (P ≤ 0.05) with BMD treatment, whereas performance was better (P ≤ 0.05) in control group (no BMD in the feed) at the time of commercial processing.  and butyrate production was affected (P ≤ 0.05) by age, whereas propionate production was affected (P ≤ 0.05) by both the treatment and age. The bacterial communities in the cecum were more diverse (P ≤ 0.001) and rich compared to the ileal communities, and they shifted in parallel to one another as the chicks matured. Differences in diversity and species richness were not observed (P > 0.05) between the BMD-fed and control groups. Comparing all ages, treatments and diets, the composition of cecal and ileal bacterial communities was different (P ≤ 0.001). Inclusion of BMD in the feed did not affect the bacterial phyla. However, predictable shift in the ileal and cecal bacterial population at lower taxonomic level was observed in control vs BMD-fed group. Cytokines gene expression (IL-10, IL-4, IFN-γ, beta-defensin, and TLR-4) was affected (P≤ 0.05) in the BMD-fed group at early stages of growth. The prevalence of foodborne pathogens, Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. showed higher abundance in the ilea of BMD-fed chicks compared to control group. Overall, this study provided insight of the impact of AGP supplementation in the feed on gut microbial modulations, bird performance, host  and pathogen prevalence. This information can assist in designing alternative strategies to replace antibiotics in modern poultry production and for food safety.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30663336>Dietary selenium supplementation alleviates immune toxicity in the hearts of chickens with lead-added drinking water.</a></h2><p>Lead (Pb) is an environmental pollutant and can damage organisms. Selenium (Se) can alleviate Pb poisoning. The present study aimed to investigate the alleviative effect of Se on Pb-induced immune toxicity in chicken hearts. One-hundred-and-eighty Hy-line male chickens were randomly divided into four groups at 7 days of age. The control group was offered a standard commercial diet (SD) and drinking water (DW); the Se group was offered SD supplemented with sodium selenite (SeSD) and DW; the Pb + Se group was offered SeSD and DW supplemented with lead  (PbDW); and the Pb group was offered SD and PbDW. Relative mRNA expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukins (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12β, IL-17 and IFN-γ), and heat shock proteins (HSP27, HSP40, HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90) were determined by means of quantitative real-time PCR. Relative protein expression of iNOS, HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90 was assessed, as well as nitric oxide (NO) content and iNOS activity in heart tissue. The results indicated a down-regulation of interleukin (IL)-2 and IFN-γ and an up-regulation of NO, iNOS, interleukins (IL-4, IL-6, IL-12β, IL-17), and heat shock proteins (HSP27, HSP40, HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90) in Pb-damaged hearts. Se alleviated all of the above Pb-induced changes. There were time-dependent effects on NO content, iNOS activity, and mRNA levels of iNOS, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-17, HSP27, HSP40, HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90 after Pb treatment in the chicken hearts.

Mitochondrial proteins have been discovered to modulate these signaling pathway networks, and multiple biological behaviors to adapt to various internal environments or signaling events of human pathogenesis. Accordingly, mitochondrial dysfunction that alters the bioenergetic and biosynthetic state might contribute to multiple diseases, including cell transformation and tumor. Multiomics studies have revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and cell cycle dysregulation signaling pathways operate in human pituitary adenomas, which suggest mitochondria play critical roles in pituitary adenomas. Some drugs targeting mitochondria are found as a therapeutic strategy for pituitary adenomas, including melatonin, melatonin inhibitors, temozolomide, pyrimethamine, 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic acid, gossypol , Yougui pill, T-2 toxin, grifolic acid, cyclosporine A, dopamine agonists, and paeoniflorin. This article reviews the latest experimental evidence and potential biological roles of mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial dynamics in pituitary adenoma progression, potential molecular mechanisms between mitochondria and pituitary adenoma progression, and current status and perspectives of mitochondria-based biomarkers and targeted drugs for effective management of pituitary adenomas.Copyright © 2019 Li and Zhan.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29236713>Sirt3 deficiency does not affect venous thrombosis or NETosis despite mild elevation of intracellular ROS in platelets and neutrophils in mice.</a></h2><p>Inflammation is a common denominator in chronic diseases of aging. Yet, how inflammation fuels these diseases remains unknown. Neutrophils are the primary leukocytes involved in the early phase of innate  and inflammation. As part of their anti-microbial defense, neutrophils form extracellular traps (NETs) by releasing decondensed chromatin lined with cytotoxic proteins. NETs have been shown to induce tissue injury and thrombosis. Here, we demonstrated that Sirt3, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent protein deacetylase, an enzyme linked to human longevity, was expressed in mouse neutrophils and platelets. Using Sirt3-/- mice as a model of accelerated aging, we investigated the effects of Sirt3 deficiency on NETosis and platelet function, aiming to detect enhancement of thrombosis. More mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) were generated in neutrophils and platelets of Sirt3-/- mice compared to WT, when stimulated with a low concentration of phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) and a high concentration of thrombin, respectively. There were no differences in in vitro NETosis, with or without stimulation. Platelet aggregation was mildly augmented in Sirt3-/- mice compared to WT mice, when stimulated with a low concentration of collagen. The effect of Sirt3 deficiency on platelet and neutrophil activation in vivo was examined by the venous thrombosis model of inferior vena cava stenosis. Elevation of plasma DNA concentration was observed after stenosis in both genotypes, but no difference was shown between the two genotypes. The systemic response to thrombosis was enhanced in Sirt3-/- mice with significantly elevated neutrophil count and reduced platelet count. However, no differences were observed in incidence of thrombus formation, thrombus weight and thrombin-antithrombin complex generation between WT and Sirt3-/- mice. We conclude that Sirt3 does not considerably impact NET formation, platelet function, or venous thrombosis in healthy young mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30677395>Techniques to study phagocytosis and uptake of Leishmania tarentolae by J774 macrophages.</a></h2><p>Leishmaniasis is a vector borne parasitic disease affecting millions of people worldwide and is spreading into further areas because of global warming. The development of new active substances against these single-cell eukaryotic parasites is of great importance. Leishmania tarentolae promastigotes (LtP) are non-pathogenic for mammals and serve as model organisms for pathogenic Leishmania in basic research. However, it is important to refine methods to study the process of the infection of mammalian macrophages by LtP and pathogenic Leishmania. Important stages of the infection are phagocytosis by macrophages and multiplication of Leishmania amastigotes in the phagolysosome of macrophages. In this study, advanced methods using electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy and genetically manipulated LtP were used to monitor the infection of adherent J774 macrophages with LtP. An ESR method was established to detect the formation of superoxide radicals directly in adherent J774 cells and to investigate the effect of LtP on this activity. J774 cells responded with a burst of superoxide radicals in the presence of phorbol myristate  as positive control. In contrast, challenging J774 cells with LtP resulted in a much lower burst of superoxide radicals. To facilitate LtP detection in the phagolysosome of J774 macrophages, LtP expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP-LtP) were constructed. After different infection times with EGFP-LtP, the J774 cells were visualized by phase contrast microscopy and the cell number was determined. The intramacrophage Leishmania tarentolae amastigotes (LtA) expressing EGFP were detected by fluorescence microscopy and then counted with ImageJ. These experiments showed that LtP are taken up by J774 cells and form intraphagolysosomal amastigotes. LtA under our conditions multiplied intracellularly and were able to persist about 48 h in J774 cells. These experiments showed that ESR spectroscopy of attached macrophages and the use of the EGFP-LtP are suitable methods to study the initial phase of Leishmania infection in vitro.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the effects of maternal soluble fiber diet during pregnancy on growth traits and the developing intestine are still underexplored. Sows were allocated to either a control or 2.0% pregelatinized waxy maize starch plus guar gum (SF) dietary treatment during gestation. Growth performance, diarrhea incidence, gut microbiota composition and metabolism, and gut permeability and inflammation status of 14-day-old suckling piglets were analyzed. The maternal SF diet improved the growth rate and decreased the incidence of diarrhea in the piglets. Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed that the intestinal microbiota composition was altered by a maternal SF diet. The fecal and plasma levels of  and butyrate were also increased. Furthermore, a maternal SF diet reduced the levels of plasma zonulin and fecal lipocalin-2 but increased the plasma concentrations of interleukin 10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). Additionally, the increased relative abundances of  spp. in SF piglets were positively correlated with growth rate, while the decreased abundances of  spp. were positively correlated with fecal lipocalin-2 levels. Our data reveal that a maternal SF diet during pregnancy has remarkable effects on an offspring's growth traits and intestinal permeability and inflammation, perhaps by modulating the composition and metabolism of gut microbiota. Although the direct effects of dietary soluble fiber on gut microbiota have been extensively studied, the more indirect effects of maternal nutrition solely during pregnancy on the development of the offspring's intestine are until now largely unexplored. Our data show that a maternal soluble fiber diet during pregnancy is independently associated with changes in the intestinal microbiota composition and metabolism of suckling piglets. These findings have direct implications for refining dietary recommendations in pregnancy. Moreover, a maternal soluble fiber diet reduces intestinal permeability and prevents intestinal inflammation and an excessive systemic immune response of suckling piglets. Therefore, the suckling piglets' resistance to disease was enhanced, diarrhea was reduced, and weight gain was raised. Additionally, the changes in gut microbiota in response to a maternal soluble fiber diet may also be directly correlated with the offspring's growth and gut development.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29802884>Effects of acute ammonia toxicity on oxidative stress, immune response and apoptosis of juvenile yellow catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco and the mitigation of exogenous taurine.</a></h2><p>Ammonia can easily form in intensive culture systems due to ammonification of uneaten food and animal excretion, which usually brings detrimental health effects to fish. However, little information is available on the mechanisms of the detrimental effects of ammonia stress and mitigate means in fish. In this study, the four experimental groups were carried out to test the response of yellow catfish to ammonia toxicity and their mitigation through taurine: group 1 was injected with NaCl, group 2 was injected with ammonium , group 3 was injected with ammonium  and taurine, and group 4 was injected taurine. The results showed that ammonia poisoning could induce ammonia, glutamine, glutamate and malondialdehyde accumulation, and subsequently lead to blood deterioration (red blood cell, hemoglobin and serum biochemical index reduced), oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase and catalase activities declined) and immunosuppression (lysozyme, 50% hemolytic complement, total immunoglobulin, phagocytic index and respiratory burst reduced), but the exogenous taurine could mitigate the adverse effect of ammonia poisoning. In addition, ammonia poisoning could induce up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes (Cu/Zn-SOD, CAT, GPx and GR), inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-1 and IL-8) and apoptosis (p53, Bax, caspase 3 and caspase 9) genes transcription, suggesting that cell apoptotic and inflammation may relate to oxidative stress. This result will be helpful to understand the mechanism of aquatic toxicology induced by ammonia in fish.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are a critical source of the T2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13, which promote acute asthma exacerbation. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been shown to attenuate T cell-mediated allergic airway inflammation. However, their role in regulation of ILC2-driven AHR and lung inflammation remains unknown.We investigated the immunomodulatory role of SCFAs in regulation of ILC2-induced AHR and airway inflammation and delineated the mechanism involved.We assessed the role of SCFAs in regulating survival, proliferation, and cytokine production in lung sorted ILC2s. The SCFA butyrate was administered through drinking water or intranasally in BALB/c mice to evaluate its role in the ILC2-driven inflammatory response in IL-33 and Alternaria alternata models of allergic inflammation. We further confirmed our findings in human ILC2s.We show that butyrate, but not  or propionate, inhibited IL-13 and IL-5 production by murine ILC2s. Systemic and local administration of butyrate significantly ameliorated ILC2-driven AHR and airway inflammation. We further demonstrate that butyrate inhibited ILC2 proliferation and GATA3 expression but did not induce cell apoptosis, likely through histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition, because trichostatin A, a pan-HDAC inhibitor, exerted similar effects on ILC2s. Importantly, cotreatment with trichostatin A and butyrate did not result in an additive effect. Finally, we show that butyrate reduces cytokine production in human ILC2s.Our findings identify butyrate as a critical regulator of ILC2 proliferation and function through its HDAC inhibitory activity and can serve as a potential therapeutic target for asthma.Copyright © 2018 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

However, there is still no report focus on the determination of SCFAs level in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), the most common sample used for screening biomarkers of the pulmonary diseases. Herein, an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (UHPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap) oriented 3-nitrophenylhydrazine (3-NPH)-based derivatization method was developed for the quantification of SCFAs in BALF. To achieve accurate quantitation, d4- was used as internal standard to compensate for the matrix effects. Method validation showed a good linearity (R > 0.9992) with wide concentration range, and the intra-day and inter-day precision for determination of eight SCFAs in BALF samples was ≤ 14.79%. The quantitation accuracy, assessed by relative recoveries, ranged from 90% to 110% for target SCFAs at three concentration levels. Matrix effects ranged from 85% to 115%, and the lower limits of quantification of these targeted SCFAs were varied from 3 to 24 nmol/L. The SCFAs-targeted method was then applied to determine the changed levels in BALF samples from OVA-induced asthma mice and normal mice. In addition, the universality of our developed method was also demonstrated by determining the SCFAs concentrations in feces, serum and lung tissue samples from asthma and normal mice. These results indicate that 3-NPH derivatization based UHPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap provides accurate view of global SCFAs alternation in different samples, giving a support to deduce the origin of SCFAs in lung.

The impact of plant volatiles in shaping herbivore defenses is unclear. Here, we report that specific plant volatiles induce immune responses in the polyphagous herbivore, Spodoptera litura. We characterized the hemocyte profile and established their functional significance with respect to ontogeny and exposure to specific plant volatiles. Fifth instar larvae showed the highest number and hemocytes diversity. We characterized seven different types of hemocytes, of which granulocytes performed phagocytosis, oenocytoids showed melanization activity, and plasmatocytes along with granulocytes and oenocytoids were found to be involved in encapsulation. Among the six volatiles tested, exposure to (E)-β-ocimene caused the highest increase in total hemocytes number (THC) followed by linalool and (Z)-3-hexenyl  exposure. Although THC did not differ between these three volatile treatments, circulating hemocytes diversity varied significantly. (E)-β-ocimene exposure showed higher number of plasmatocytes and phenol oxidase activity. The interaction of the parasitic wasp Bracon brevicornis with (E)-β-ocimene exposed larvae was poor in terms of delayed paralysis and lower egg deposition. In choice assays, the wasp showed clear preference towards control larvae indicating (E)-β-ocimene treatment renders the host unattractive. Hemocyte profiles post-parasitoid exposure and (E)-β-ocimene treatment were similar indicating cue-based priming. When challenged with Bacillus thuringiensis, linalool exposure resulted in the highest survival as compared to other volatiles.

The villi height was increased (P < 0.05) and the crypt depth was decreased (P < 0.05) in the duodenum and ileum of SPF chickens fed inulin, as compared with the control group. Also, inulin at a low concentration (0.25 or 0.5%) significantly decreased (P < 0.05) the gene expression of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor (LITAF) at 7, 14, and 21 d, and of interleukin-6 (IL-6), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) at 7 and 14 d, and increased that of mucin 2 (MUC2) and claudin-1 in the ileum of SPF chickens at 7, 14, and 21 d. High inulin supplementation (2%) significantly increased the gene expression of NF-κB, LITAF, IL-6, iNOS, and Claudin-1 at 14 and 21 d compared to low inulin concentration (0.25 or 0.5%).

The level of IL-4 splice variants in THP-1 cells increased after M. tb H37Rv infection. Three splice variants of TLR4 were detected in M. tb-infected THP-1 cells, when compared with uninfected controls; the expression level of these splicing variants in M. tb-infected THP-1 cell was down-regulated. Since SR proteins are RNA-binding proteins that regulate RNA splicing, the expression of SR proteins was examined, and SRSF2 and SRSF3 were significantly down-regulated.

The aim of this study was to identify the effect of a short-term diet high in sugar on susceptibility to colitis. Adult wild-type mice were placed on chow or a high sugar diet (50% sucrose) ± . After two days of diet, mice were treated with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce colitis. Disease severity was assessed daily. Colonic tissues were analyzed for cytokine expression using the MesoScale discovery platform. Intestinal dextran permeability and serum lipopolysaccharide levels (LPS) were measured. Gut microbiota were analyzed by 16s rRNA sequencing and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations by gas chromatography. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were incubated with LPS and cytokine secretion measured. Mice on a high sugar diet had increased gut permeability, decreased microbial diversity and reduced SCFA. BMDM derived from high sugar fed mice were highly responsive to LPS. High sugar fed mice had increased susceptibility to colitis and pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations. Oral  significantly attenuated colitis in mice by restoring permeability. In conclusion, short term exposure to a high sugar diet increases susceptibility to colitis by reducing short-chain fatty acids and increasing gut permeability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30171972>The Nrf2 activator tBHQ inhibits the activation of primary murine natural killer cells.</a></h2><p>Tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) is a commonly used food preservative with known immunomodulatory activity; however, there is little information regarding its role on natural killer (NK) cell activation and function. tBHQ is a known activator of the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which results in induction of cytoprotective genes. Activation of Nrf2 has been shown to modulate immune responses in a number of different models. In addition, studies in our laboratory have shown that tBHQ inhibits numerous early events following T cell activation. In the current study, we investigated whether activated NK cells are impacted by tBHQ, since many signaling cascades that control NK cell effector function also contribute to T cell function. Splenocytes were isolated from female, wild-type C57Bl/6J mice and treated with 1 μM or 5 μM tBHQ. NK cell function was assessed after activation with phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) and ionomycin for 24 h. Activation of NK cells in the presence of tBHQ decreased total NK cell percentage, production of intracellular interferon gamma (IFNɣ), granzyme B, and perforin, and induction of the cell surface proteins CD25 and CD69, which are markers of NK cell activation. In addition to NK cell effector function, NK cell maturation was also altered in response to tBHQ. Notably, this is the first study to demonstrate that the Nrf2 activator, tBHQ, negatively impacts effector function and maturation of NK cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the transcriptional, metabolic, and epigenetic regulation of Trm cell and TIL development and function is largely undefined. Here, we found that the transcription factor Bhlhe40 was specifically required for Trm cell and TIL development and polyfunctionality. Local PD-1 signaling inhibited TIL Bhlhe40 expression, and Bhlhe40 was critical for TIL reinvigoration following anti-PD-L1 blockade. Mechanistically, Bhlhe40 sustained Trm cell and TIL mitochondrial fitness and a functional epigenetic state. Building on these findings, we identified an epigenetic and metabolic regimen that promoted Trm cell and TIL gene signatures associated with tissue residency and polyfunctionality. This regimen empowered the anti-tumor activity of CD8 T cells and possessed therapeutic potential even at an advanced tumor stage in mouse models.

The inflammatory responses that follow respiratory infections are protective leading to pathogen clearance but can also be deleterious if unregulated. The microbiota is known to be an important protective barrier against infections, mediating both direct inhibitory effects against the potential pathogen and also regulating the immune responses contributing to a proper clearance of the pathogen and return to homeostasis. GPR43 is one receptor for , a microbiota metabolite shown to induce and to regulate important immune functions. Here, we addressed the role of GPR43 signaling during pulmonary bacterial infections. We have shown for the first time that the absence of GPR43 leads to increased susceptibility to  infection, which was associated to both uncontrolled proliferation of bacteria and to increased inflammatory response. Mechanistically, we showed that GPR43 expression especially in neutrophils and alveolar macrophages is important for bacterial phagocytosis and killing. In addition, treatment with the GPR43 ligand, , is protective during bacterial lung infection. This was associated to reduction in the number of bacteria in the airways and to the control of the inflammatory responses.

It has been reported that RMD enhanced immunoglobulin A (IgA) secretion, which protects the mucosa from foreign substances. However, the effect of RMD on excessive  has yet to be investigated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of RMD on excessive immune responses such as food allergy. OVA23-3 mice were fed an AIN-76-based diet containing 20% egg-white protein with or without RMD. While RMD was shown to contribute to an increase in goblet cells, RMD did not change the overall inflammatory status when ingested with the egg-white diet. RMD suppressed IL-4 and IL-10 production from splenocytes but not cells from mesenteric lymph nodes. RMD also downregulated the serum levels of OVA-specific Th1- and Th2-related antibodies, which were elevated in the food-allergic condition. RMD significantly increased the total amount of short-chain fatty acids, especially  and propionate, in the caecum of OVA23-3 mice fed the egg-white diet. Our study demonstrated that dietary RMD modulates systemic rather than intestinal antigen-specific immune responses in the food-allergic condition of OVA23-3 mice.

Once daily the lambs received MR alone (Group CON, n = 8), MR + 0.096 g CA/kg live weight (LW) (Group CARN, n = 8) or MR + 0.024 g of α-tocopheryl  per kg LW (Group VitE, n = 8). After reaching the target slaughter weight (12 ± 0.5 kg), blood samples were collected to measure haematological and immunological parameters. Then, lambs were subjected to 4-h road transport and blood samples were collected again for haematological assessment. The animals were subsequently slaughtered. Before road transport, dietary CA supplementation promoted a descent of circulating white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (RBC), haematocrit and haemoglobin concentration when compared with Groups CON and VitE (p < 0.05), but it did not affect production of cytokines by blood mononuclear cells. Road transport did not affect either RBC or haematocrit significantly. Nevertheless, transport affected leucocyte profile similarly in all the treatments, increasing granulocytes and monocytes proportions and decreasing lymphocytes. In contrast, after transport, WBC was increased in Group CARN, reaching similar values than Groups CON and VitE. However, under conditions of the present study, those modifications did not influence animal performance or  parameters of artificially reared suckling lambs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30325010>Th17 responses to pneumococcus in blood and adenoidal cells in children.</a></h2><p>Pneumococcal infections cause a large global health burden, and the search for serotype-independent vaccines continues. Existing conjugate vaccines reduce nasopharyngeal colonization by target serotypes. Such mucosal effects of novel antigens may similarly be important. CD4 Th17 cell-dependent, antibody-independent reductions in colonization and enhanced clearance have been described in mice. Here we describe the evaluation of T helper type 17 (Th17) cytokine responses to candidate pneumococcal protein vaccine antigens in human cell culture, using adenoidal and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Optimal detection of interleukin (IL)-17A was at day 7, and of IL-22 at day 11, in these primary cell cultures. Removal of CD45RO memory T cells abolished these responses. Age-associated increases in magnitude of responses were evident for IL-17A, but not IL-22, in adenoidal cells. There was a strong correlation between individual IL-17A and IL-22 responses after pneumococcal antigen stimulation (P < 0·015). Intracellular cytokine staining following phorbol myristate  (PMA)/ionomycin stimulation demonstrated that  > 30% CD4 T cells positive for IL-22 express the innate markers γδT cell receptor and/or CD56, with much lower proportions for IL-17A cells (P < 0·001). Responses to several vaccine candidate antigens were observed but were consistently absent, particularly in blood, to PhtD (P < 0·0001), an antigen recently shown not to impact colonization in a clinical trial of a PhtD-containing conjugate vaccine in infants. The data presented and approach discussed have the potential to assist in the identification of novel vaccine antigens aimed at reducing pneumococcal carriage and transmission, thus improving the design of empirical clinical trials.© 2018 British Society for Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30195390>Effects of azinphos-methyl on enzymatic activity and cellular immune response in the hemolymph of the freshwater snail Chilina gibbosa.</a></h2><p>The use of a battery of biomarkers, especially those more closely related to species integrity, is desired for more complete ecotoxicological assessments of the effects of pesticide contamination on aquatic organisms. The phosphorodithioate azinphos-methyl has been intensively used in agriculture worldwide and have been found in the habitat of Chilina gibbosa, a freshwater snail endemic to South America. This snail has been proposed as a good model organism for ecotoxicity bioassays on the basis of studies focused mainly on enzymatic responses in whole tissue homogenates. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of an acute 48 h exposure to an environmental concentration of azinphos-methyl on C. gibbosa hemolymph enzymatic activity and cellular immune response. Our results show that cholinesterase activity was strongly inhibited (94%) in hemolymph of exposed snails. Carboxylesterase activity measured with p-nitrophenyl butyrate and glutathione S-transferase activity were augmented 47% and 89% respectively after exposure. No differences were found for hemolymph carboxylesterase activity measured with p-nitrophenyl . These results differ from those reported for whole tissue homogenates and reveal that tissue-specific responses of enzymatic biomarkers exist in this species. Regarding immune cell response, hemocytes were identified for the first time for C. gibbosa. Their viability and phagocytic activity decreased after azinphos-methyl exposure although total number of circulating cells did not differ between treatments. We conclude that concentrations of azinphos-methyl that can be found in the environment can compromise both hemolymph cholinesterase activity and the immune system of C. gibbosa. Furthermore, we propose that carboxylesterase and glutathione S-transferase activities measured in hemolymph and hemocyte viability and phagocytic activity could be incorporated as sensitive biomarkers to evaluate the effects of pesticide exposure on this and related species.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Epidermal FABP (E-FABP) is the predominant FABP expressed in skin epidermis. However, the role of E-FABP in skin homeostasis and pathology remains largely unknown. Herein, we utilized the 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene and 12-O-tetradecanolyphorbol-13--induced skin tumorigenesis model to assess the role of E-FABP in chemical-induced skin tumorigenesis. Compared to their wild-type littermates, mice deficient in E-FABP, but not adipose FABP, developed more skin tumors with higher incidence. 12-O-tetradecanolyphorbol-13- functioning as a tumor promoter induced E-FABP expression and initiated extensive flaring inflammation in skin. Interestingly, 12-O-tetradecanolyphorbol-13- -induced production of IFN-β and IFN-λ in the skin tissue was dependent on E-FABP expression. Further protein and gene expression arrays demonstrated that E-FABP was critical in enhancing IFN-induced p53 responses and in suppressing SOX2 expression in keratinocytes. Thus, E-FABP expression in skin suppresses chemical-induced skin tumorigenesis through regulation of IFN/p53/SOX2 pathway. Collectively, our data suggest an unknown function of E-FABP in prevention of skin tumor development, and offer E-FABP as a therapeutic target for improving skin innate  in chemical-induced skin tumor prevention.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

To thrive, the bacteria residing in their mammalian host have to withstand the antibactericidal responses of neutrophils. We report that enterobactin (Ent), a catecholate siderophore expressed by , inhibited PMA-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in mouse and human neutrophils. Ent also impaired the degranulation of primary granules and inhibited phagocytosis and bactericidal activity of neutrophils, without affecting their migration and chemotaxis. Molecular analysis revealed that Ent can chelate intracellular labile iron that is required for neutrophil oxidative responses. Other siderophores (pyoverdine, ferrichrome, deferoxamine) likewise inhibited ROS and NETs in neutrophils, thus indicating that the chelation of iron may largely explain their inhibitory effects. To counter iron theft by Ent, neutrophils rely on the siderophore-binding protein lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) in a "tug-of-war" for iron. The inhibition of neutrophil ROS and NETs by Ent was augmented in Lcn2-deficient neutrophils compared with wild-type neutrophils but was rescued by the exogenous addition of recombinant Lcn2. Taken together, our findings illustrate the novel concept that microbial siderophore's iron-scavenging property may serve as an antiradical defense system that neutralizes the immune functions of neutrophils.Copyright © 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643883>Retinoids.</a></h2><p>Retinoids are both natural and synthetic derivatives of vitamin A, several of which have been developed for medical uses, largely to replace vitamin A which in high, therapeutic doses is associated with considerable toxicity. Retinoids have multiple actions and play important roles in regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, vision, bone growth, tumor suppression and . The effects of retinoids are thought to be mediated by their binding to and activation of the retinoic acid and retinoid X receptors which regulate gene expression, important in normal growth and differentiation. Vitamin A in doses that have medical effects was found to be toxic, particularly when given long term. Modification of the vitamin A structure led to retinoid molecules that had many of its beneficial, but fewer of its adverse effects. Oral retinoids in use in the United States include acitretin for psoriasis and isotretinoin for severe nodular acne. Tretinoin is used topically and several other retinoids have been developed for therapy of uncommon forms of cancer (alitretinoin, bexarotene). The commonly used retinoids have many of the side effects of vitamin A including dry skin, cheilosis and nosebleeds and hair loss, but are not stored in the liver and do not cause the typical form of chronic liver disease associated with excessive vitamin A intake. Both acitretin and isotretinoin are teratogenic and embryotoxic and are contraindicated in women who are or intend to become pregnant. Retinoids have been implicated in causing mild-to-moderate elevations in routine liver tests, but these elevations are usually asymptomatic and transient, resolving spontaneously even with continued therapy. Marked elevations in serum aminotransferase levels during retinoid therapy are uncommon, and dose adjustment or drug discontinuation are rarely required for liver test abnormalities. Nevertheless, laboratory monitoring is recommended with routine liver tests at baseline and one month later, and testing thereafter only if abnormalities were found or symptoms arise. Several retinoids (acitretin, etretinate, retinal ) have been associated with a clinically apparent acute liver injury which typically arises during the first 3 months of therapy, has many features of hypersensitivity and can be severe and even fatal. Interestingly, isotretinoin often causes mild serum aminotransferase elevations and is commonly listed as having frequent adverse effects on the liver, but it has not been convincingly linked to instances of severe clinically apparent, acute liver injury with jaundice. Two retinoids used in dermatology, acitretin and isotretinoin, are discussed in this record and their combined references of retinoids are provided at the end of this introductory section.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with natural flavonoids (naringin and hesperidin) on laying hens' performance, cellular  and egg quality parameters. 2. A total of 72 individually caged laying hens were allocated into 1 of 6 treatment groups: a control (C) group that was fed with a basal diet and groups that were offered the same diet further supplemented with hesperidin at 0.75 g/kg (E1), or 1.5 g/kg (E2), or naringin at 0.75 g/kg (N1), or 1.5 g/kg (N2) or α-tocopheryl  at 0.2 mg/kg (VE) for 67 d. 3. Supplementation with naringin or hesperidin did not affect the performance and egg quality ( > 0.05) apart from an improvement in the yolk colour that was more orange in naringin and hesperidin groups in comparison to the controls (-linear < 0.05). Egg yolk and plasma cholesterol levels were not affected by citrus flavonoids (-linear > 0.05). 4. Inflammatory immune response, measured by phytohaemagglutinin skin test (PHA), was suppressed in laying hens that were fed with either naringin (-linear < 0.05) or hesperidin ( < 0.05). Egg yolk oxidative stability was improved from the 4th d after naringin or hesperidin supplementation. This beneficial effect was comparable to that of α-tocopheryl  and was observed in eggs that were stored for up to 120 d. 5. In conclusion, naringin and hesperidin may favourably prolong the shelf life of eggs, appear to possess anti-inflammatory properties and could improve the yolk colour without any side effects on the performance or egg quality traits.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29527304>Metabolomics characterization of colostrum in three sow breeds and its influences on piglets' survival and litter growth rates.</a></h2><p>Colostrum is the first secretion produced by mammary glands during the hours immediately preceding and succeeding parturition. This secretion differs from milk and represents an essential vehicle of passive , prebiotic compounds and growth factors involved in intestinal development. Most of the literature concerning colostrum composition refers mainly to human and cow; and little is known about pig colostrum metabolome and how it varies between pig breeds and different farrowing parity. Thus, the aim of the present research is to provide new information about pig colostrum composition and the associations between metabolites, the sows' breed and the survival and growth rates of their litters.Colostrum samples were gathered from 58 parturitions of sows belonging to three different breeds chosen for their importance in Italian heavy pig production: 31 Large White, 15 Landrace and 12 Duroc respectively. The defatted and ultrafiltered colostrum samples were analysed using H-NMR spectroscopy. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was assessed on the obtained spectra. In addition, using a Stepwise Regression and a Linear Regression analyses the metabolites named after the signals assignment were tested for their associations with piglets' performances. Twenty-five metabolites were identified, comprehending monosaccharides, disaccharides (such as lactose), organic acids (lactate, citrate,  and formate), nitrogenous organic acids (such as creatine) and other compounds, including nucleotides. PCA results evidence a clustering due to breed and season effects. Lactose was the main compound determining the assignment of the samples into different clusters according to the sow breed. Furthermore, some metabolites showed to be associated with piglets' performance and survival traits:  and taurine were positively related to litter weight gain and piglets' survival rate, respectively, while dimethylamine and cis-aconitate were linked to new-borns' impaired ability to survive.The results obtained suggest that colostrum composition is affected by breed, which, together with environmental conditions, may cause changes in colostrum metabolites content with possible consequences on piglets' performances. Among the identified metabolites, , taurine, dimethylamine and cis-aconitate showed consistent associations with piglets' survival rate and litter weight gain, implying that these compounds may affect new-borns' ability to survive.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31316490>The Capacity of the Fecal Microbiota From Malawian Infants to Ferment Resistant Starch.</a></h2><p>In Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC), weaning is associated with environmentally acquired and inflammation-associated enteric disorders. Dietary intake of high amylose maize starch (HAMS) can promote commensal fermentative bacteria and drive the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). By stabilizing commensal gut microbiology, and stimulating the production of anti-inflammatory metabolites, HAMS supplementation might therefore influence enteric health. However, the extent to which the gut microbiota of LMIC infants are capable of fermenting HAMS is unclear. We assessed the capacity of the fecal microbiota from pre-weaning and weaning Malawian infants to ferment HAMS and produce SCFAs using an  fermentation model. Fecal microbiota from both pre-weaning and weaning infants were able to ferment HAMS, as indicated by an increase in bacterial load and total SCFA concentration, and a reduction in pH. All of these changes were more substantial in the weaning group.  production was observed with both pre-weaning and weaning groups, while propionate production was only observed in the weaning group. HAMS fermentation resulted in significant alterations to the fecal microbial community in the weaning group, with significant increases in levels of , and  associated with propionate production. In conclusion, fecal microbiota from Malawian infants before and during weaning has the capacity to produce  through HAMS fermentation, with propionate biosynthetic capability appearing only at weaning. Our results suggest that HAMS supplementation might provide benefit to infants during weaning.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30196707>Interactive effects of α-tocopheryl  and zinc supplementation on the antioxidant and immune systems of broilers.</a></h2><p>1. A total of 1440 one-day-old Ross 308 male broilers were allocated to 12 dietary treatments to evaluate dose-dependent effects of α-tocopheryl  (α-TOA) combined with zinc (Zn) supplementation on humoral and cellular immune responses, antioxidant enzymes, serum and hepatic contents of vitamins and minerals in broilers. 2. Three levels of supplemental α-TOA (0, 150 and 300 mg/kg) and 4 levels of Zn (0, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) were combined as a completely randomised design as a 3 × 4 factorial arrangement. 3. Concentrations of serum α-tocopherol and selenium were influenced by the interaction of α-TOA and Zn. The interaction of α-TOA and Zn affected malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in serum and liver ( < 0.05). Incremental amounts of supplemental Zn augmented the effects of α-TOA in reducing serum and hepatic MDA concentrations. 4. The interaction of α-TOA and Zn on antibody titres (< 0.05) was such that increasing level of Zn at each α-TOA level led to a linear enhancement in antibody titre. Moreover, dietary supplementation with α-TOA and Zn resulted in an increase in relative weight of lymphoid organs (thymus, bursa, spleen;  < 0.05) along with an increase in humoral and cellular immune responses ( < 0.05). 5. In conclusion, α-TOA with Zn showed interactive effects in improving oxidative stability and humoral immune responses, which could result from their impact on the concentrations of antioxidant vitamins and minerals in tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30984596>Zinc Therapy in Treatment of Symptomatic Oral Lichen Planus.</a></h2><p>Lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory disease, which involves skin, mucous membrane, and nails. Prevalence of oral lichen planus varies between 0.5% and 2.6% of adult population worldwide with overall female preponderance. It is considered as a potentially malignant disorder with rate of transformation to oral cancer varying between 0.5% and 2%. Oral lichen planus may either be unilateral or bilateral, or may involve multiple sites. Although the exact etio-pathogenesis of this condition is unknown, it is believed that stress, use of medications, dental fillings, genetics, , and hypersensitivity reactions may contribute to its pathogenesis. It is a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disorder in which CD8+ T cells are involved which release various cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleuking-12 leading to disruption of basement membrane integrity. Zinc activates caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation, resulting in the apoptosis of keratinocytes. By prevention of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 activation, it inhibits T-cell accumulation in oral lichen planus, and by inhibiting MMP-9 it prevents cleavage of collagen IV resulting in maintaining the integrity of the basement membrane. The present case series describes the use of oral zinc  (50 mg) in patients having symptomatic oral lichen planus with favorable outcome in terms of size of lesion and global index score.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31137747>Effects of Licorice Extract Supplementation on Feed Intake, Digestion, Rumen Function, Blood Indices and Live Weight Gain of Karakul Sheep.</a></h2><p>This study was designed to investigate the effects of licorice extract supplemented to a cottonseed hull-based diet on rumen function, blood indices and growth of Karakul sheep. Twelve rumen-fistulated 1.5-year-old sheep were blocked in pairs by live weight. Sheep within pairs were randomly allocated to feed either on a cottonseed hull basal diet (control group) or on a basal diet containing 4.5% of licorice extract on dry matter (DM) basis (supplemented group). Sheep were housed individually and fed for 60 days, with a 15-day adaptation period and a 45-day measurement period. Feed intake and live weight gain were quantified. Rumen and blood samples were taken during the measurement period. The DM intake was lower for the supplemented group than for the control group. The mean ruminal concentrations of total volatile fatty acid (VFA) and  and the ratio of  to propionate were lower, while the levels of propionate and butyrate were higher for the supplemented group than for the control group. Average daily live weight gain, digestible energy intake, apparent nutrient digestibility and feed conversion efficiency did not differ between the two treatments. The serum concentrations of immunoglobulin A and G were 2.1 and 1.8 times greater, and total antioxidant and superoxide dismutase increased by 1.8 and 1.2 times in the supplemented group compared with the control group. These results indicated that licorice extract supplementation in the diet at 4.5% of DM had a limited impact on rumen function but improved blood immunoglobulin and anti-oxidative status of Karakul sheep, without impairment of feed conversion efficiency or live weight gain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546048>Bone marrow-derived epithelial cells and hair follicle stem cells contribute to development of chronic cutaneous neoplasms.</a></h2><p>We used allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and a mouse multistage cutaneous carcinogenesis model to probe recruitment of bone marrow-derived epithelial cells (BMDECs) in skin tumors initiated with the carcinogen, dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), and promoted with 12-O-tetradecanolyphorbol-13- (TPA). BMDECs clustered in the lesional epithelium, expressed cytokeratins, proliferated, and stratified. We detected cytokeratin induction in plastic-adherent bone marrow cells (BMCs) cultured in the presence of filter-separated keratinocytes (KCs) and bone morphogenetic protein 5 (BMP5). Lineage-depleted BMCs migrated towards High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) protein and epidermal KCs in ex vivo invasion assays. Naive female mice receiving BMTs from DMBA-treated donors developed benign and malignant lesions after TPA promotion alone. We conclude that BMDECs contribute to the development of papillomas and dysplasia, demonstrating a systemic contribution to these lesions. Furthermore, carcinogen-exposed BMCs can initiate benign and malignant lesions upon tumor promotion. Ultimately, these findings may suggest targets for treatment of non-melanoma skin cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31020588>Ergoferon Increases IL-2 Production by Activated Lymphocytes.</a></h2><p>We studied the effects of Ergoferon on the production of antiviral cytokine IL-2 by type 1 CD4T cells.

Here we investigated phenotypic and transcriptomic differences between the young and aging heart using a mineralocorticoid-excess model of hypertension. Ten-week ("young") and 36-week ("aging") mice underwent a unilateral uninephrectomy with deoxycorticosterone  (DOCA) pellet implantation ( = 6-8/group) and were followed for 6 weeks. Cardiac structure and function, blood pressure (BP) and the cardiac transcriptome were subsequently examined. Young and aging DOCA mice had high BP, increased cardiac mass, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased in aging DOCA-treated mice in contrast to young DOCA mice. Interstitial and perivascular fibrosis occurred in response to DOCA, but perivascular fibrosis was greater in aging mice. Transcriptomic analysis showed that young mice had features of higher oxidative stress, likely due to activation of the respiratory electron transport chain. In contrast, aging mice showed up-regulation of collagen formation in association with activation of innate  together with markers of inflammation including cytokine and platelet signaling. In comparison to younger mice, aging mice demonstrated different phenotypic and molecular responses to hypertensive stress. These findings have potential implications for the pathogenesis of age-related forms of cardiovascular disease, particularly heart failure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30068593>Glatiramer  Enhances Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cell Function via Recognition of Paired Ig-like Receptor B.</a></h2><p>Glatiramer  (GA; Copaxone) is a copolymer therapeutic that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the relapsing-remitting form of multiple sclerosis. Despite an unclear mechanism of action, studies have shown that GA promotes protective Th2  and stimulates release of cytokines that suppress autoimmunity. In this study, we demonstrate that GA interacts with murine paired Ig-like receptor B (PIR-B) on myeloid-derived suppressor cells and suppresses the STAT1/NF-κB pathways while promoting IL-10/TGF-β cytokine release. In inflammatory bowel disease models, GA enhanced myeloid-derived suppressor cell-dependent CD4 regulatory T cell generation while reducing proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Human monocyte-derived macrophages responded to GA by reducing TNF-α production and promoting CD163 expression typical of alternative maturation despite the presence of GM-CSF. Furthermore, GA competitively interacts with leukocyte Ig-like receptors B (LILRBs), the human orthologs of PIR-B. Because GA limited proinflammatory activation of myeloid cells, therapeutics that target LILRBs represent novel treatment modalities for autoimmune indications.Copyright © 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30420720>Influence of dietary supplementation with Bacillus licheniformis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as alternatives to monensin on growth performance, antioxidant, , ruminal fermentation and microbial diversity of fattening lambs.</a></h2><p>Alternatives to antibiotics for improving productivity and maintaining the health of livestock health are urgently needed. The scope of this research was conducted to investigate the effects of two alternatives (Bacillus licheniformis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to monensin on growth performance, antioxidant capacity, , ruminal fermentation and microbial diversity of fattening lambs. One hundred and sixty Dorper × Thin-tailed Han sheep (32 ± 3.45 kg BW) were randomly assigned into 5 treatments of n = 32 lambs/group. Lambs in the control group were fed a basal diet (NC) while the other four treatments were fed basal diets supplemented with monensin (PC), Bacillus licheniformis (BL), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC), and the combination of Bacillus licheniformis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae with protease (BS), respectively. The experiment lasted for 66 d. Feed intake was recorded every 2 d and lambs were weighed every 20 d. Ten lambs from each group were slaughtered at the end of the trial, and samples of serum and rumen fluid were collected. The results indicated that the dietary regimen did not affect the dry matter intake (DMI). The average daily gain (ADG) of BS treatment was significantly higher than NC group (P < 0.05). Compared with the NC treatment, the other four supplementation treatments increased the concentration of growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and insulin (INS) (P < 0.05). The malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAOC) showed no significant difference among the 5 treatments while the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) of BS group was significantly increased (P < 0.05). The supplementation regimen decreased the concentration of ammonia Nitrogen (NH-N) and increased the content of microbial crude proteins (MCP) (P < 0.05). The supplementation of antibiotics and probiotics reduced the concentrations of  and increased the concentrations of propionate (P < 0.05). The supplementation treatments increased the relative abundance of Lentisphaerae, Fibrobacteres and Tenericutes at the phylum level, whereas at the genus level, they increased the relative abundance of Fibrobacter (P < 0.05). Overall, this study confirmed the facilitating effect of B. licheniformis, S. cerevisiae and their compounds on growth performance, improve the antioxidant capacity and immune function, and beneficially manipulate ruminal fermentation and microbial diversity of fatting lambs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28498408>Induction of IL-17 production from human peripheral blood CD4+ cells by asbestos exposure.</a></h2><p>We have previously reported that chronic, recurrent and low-dose exposure to asbestos fibers causes a reduction in antitumor . Investigation of natural killer (NK) cells using an in vitro cell line model and comprising in vitro activation using freshly isolated NK cells co-cultured with chrysotile fibers, as well as NK cells derived from asbestos-exposed patients with pleural plaque (PP) or malignant mesothelioma (MM), revealed decreased expression of NK cell activating receptors such as NKG2D, 2B4 and NKp46. An in vitro differentiation and clonal expansion model for CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) showed reduced cytotoxicity with decreased levels of cytotoxic molecules such as granzyme B and perforin, as well as suppressed proliferation of CTLs. Additionally, analysis of T helper cells showed that surface CXCR3, chemokine receptor, and the productive potential of interferon (IFN)γ were reduced following asbestos exposure in an in vitro cell line model and in peripheral CD4+ cells of asbestos-exposed patients. Moreover, experiments revealed that asbestos exposure enhanced regulatory T cell (Treg) function. This study also focused on CXCR3 expression and the Th-17 cell fraction. Following activation with T-cell receptor and co-culture with various concentrations of chrysotile fibers using freshly isolated CD4+ surface CXCR3 positive and negative fractions, the intracellular expression of CXCR3, IFNγ and IL-17 remained unchanged when co-cultured with chrysotile. However, subsequent re-stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) and ionomycin resulted in enhanced IL-17 production and expression, particularly in CD4+ surface CXCR3 positive cells. These results indicated that the balance and polarization between Treg and Th-17 fractions play an important role with respect to the immunological effects of asbestos and the associated reduction in antitumor .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29535716>Roles of Macrophage Exosomes in Immune Response to Calcium Oxalate Monohydrate Crystals.</a></h2><p>In kidney stone disease, macrophages secrete various mediators  classical secretory pathway and cause renal interstitial inflammation. However, whether their extracellular vesicles, particularly exosomes, are involved in kidney stone pathogenesis remained unknown. This study investigated alterations in exosomal proteome of U937-derived macrophages (by phorbol-12-myristate-13- activation) after exposure to calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) crystals for 16-h using 2-DE-based proteomics approach. Six significantly altered proteins in COM-treated exosomes were successfully identified by nanoscale liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-electron transfer dissociation tandem mass spectrometry as proteins involved mainly in immune processes, including T-cell activation and homeostasis, Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) regulation, and cell migration/movement. The decreased heat shock protein 90-beta (HSP90β) and increased vimentin were confirmed by Western blotting. ELISA showed that the COM-treated macrophages produced greater level of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), one of the markers for inflammasome activation. Functional studies demonstrated that COM-treated exosomes enhanced monocyte and T-cell migration, monocyte activation and macrophage phagocytic activity, but on the other hand, reduced T-cell activation. In addition, COM-treated exosomes enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 by monocytes that could be restored to its basal level by small-interfering RNA targeting on vimentin (si-Vimentin). Moreover, si-Vimentin could also abolish effects of COM-treated exosomes on monocyte and T-cell migration as well as macrophage phagocytic activity.

Low-fiber diets alter not only microbial composition but also the availability of metabolic end products derived from fermentation of fiber. Our objective was to examine the effects of dietary fiber supplementation on gut microbiota and associated fecal and serum metabolites in relation to metabolic markers of obesity. We conducted a 12-week, single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 53 adults with overweight or obesity. They were randomly assigned to a pea fiber (PF, 15 g/d in wafer form; n=29) or control (CO, isocaloric amount of wafers; n=24) group. Blood and fecal samples were collected at baseline and 12 weeks. Serum metabolomics, gut microbiota and fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids (BAs) were examined. Within-group but not between-group analysis showed a significant effect of treatment on serum metabolites at 12 weeks compared to baseline. Fiber significantly altered fecal SCFAs and BAs with higher  and reduced isovalerate, cholate, deoxycholate and total BAs content in the PF group compared to baseline. Microbiota was differentially modulated in the two groups, including an increase in the SCFA producer Lachnospira in the PF group and decrease in the CO group. The change in body weight of participants showed a negative correlation with their change in Lachnospira (r=-0.463, P=.006) abundance. The current study provides insight into the actions of pea fiber and its impact on modulating microbiota-host-metabolic axes in obesity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Although PMNs play a critical role in both innate  and vascular thrombosis, no previous study has systematically investigated the effect of MPO on blood coagulation. Here, we show that PMN-derived MPO inhibits the procoagulant activity (PCA) of lipidated recombinant human tissue factor (rhTF) in a time- and concentration-dependent manner that involves, but is not entirely dependent on the enzyme's catalytic activity. Similarly, MPO together with its substrate, H2O2, inhibited the PCA of plasma microvesicles isolated from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated whole blood, an effect additive to that of a function blocking TF antibody. Treatment of whole blood with LPS or phorbol-myristate- dramatically increased MPO plasma levels, and co-incubation with 4-ABAH, a specific MPO inhibitor, significantly enhanced the PCA in plasma supernatants. MPO and MPO/H2O2 also inhibited the PCA of activated platelets and purified phospholipids (PLs), suggesting that modulation of negatively charged PLs, i.e., phosphatidylserine, rather than direct interference with the TF/FVIIa initiation complex was involved. Consistently, pretreatment of activated platelets with MPO or MPO/H2O2 attenuated the subsequent binding of lactadherin, which specifically recognizes procoagulant PS on cell membranes. Finally, endogenously released MPO regulated the PCA of THP1 cells in an autocrine manner dependent on the binding to CD11b/CD18 integrins. Collectively, these findings indicate that MPO is a negative regulator of PL-dependent coagulation and suggest a more complex role of activated PMNs in haemostasis and thrombosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29757466>NADPH oxidase activation in neutrophils: Role of the phosphorylation of its subunits.</a></h2><p>Neutrophils are key cells of innate  and during inflammation. Upon activation, they produce large amounts of superoxide anion (O  ) and ensuing reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill phagocytized microbes. The enzyme responsible for O  production is called the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. This is a multicomponent enzyme system that becomes active after assembly of four cytosolic proteins (p47 , p67 , p40 and Rac2) with the transmembrane proteins (p22 and gp91 , which form the cytochrome b ). gp91 represents the catalytic subunit of the NADPH oxidase and is also called NOX2. NADPH oxidase-derived ROS are essential for microbial killing and innate ; however, excessive ROS production induces tissue injury and prolonged inflammatory reactions that contribute to inflammatory diseases. Thus, NADPH oxidase activation must be tightly regulated in time and space to limit ROS production. NADPH oxidase activation is regulated by several processes such as phosphorylation of its components, exchange of GDP/GTP on Rac2 and binding of p47 and p40 to phospholipids. This review aims to provide new insights into the role of the phosphorylation of the NADPH oxidase components, that is gp91 , p22 , p47 , p67 and p40 , in the activation of this enzyme.© 2018 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30891007>Elevated Gut Microbiome-Derived Propionate Levels Are Associated With Reduced Sterile Lung Inflammation and Bacterial  in Mice.</a></h2><p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) are important dietary and microbiome metabolites that can have roles in gut  as well as further afield. We previously observed that gut microbiome alteration via antibiotics led to attenuated lung inflammatory responses. The rationale for this study was to identify gut microbiome factors that regulate lung immune homeostasis. We first investigated key factors within mouse colonic lumen filtrates (CLF) which could elicit direct inflammatory effects . We identified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and SCFAs as key CLF ingredients whose levels and inflammatory capacity changed after antibiotic exposure in mice. Specifically, the SCFA propionate appeared to be a key regulator of LPS responses . Elevated propionate:  ratios, as seen in CLF after antibiotic exposure, strongly blunted inflammatory responses . , exposure of lungs to high dose propionate, to mimic how prior antibiotic exposure changed SCFA levels, resulted in diminished immune containment of  pneumonia. Finally, we discovered an enrichment of propionate-producing gut bacteria in mice with reduced lung inflammation following lung ischemia reperfusion injury . Overall, our data show that propionate levels can distinctly modulate lung immune responses  and  and that gut microbiome increased production of propionate is associated with reduced lung inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30689480>Neutrophil Functions in Immunodeficiency Due to DOCK8 Deficiency.</a></h2><p>Neutrophil chemotactic defects have been reported previously in patients with hyper-IgE syndrome. Bi-allelic mutations in dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) gene usually cause an autosomal recessive hyper-IgE syndrome phenotype. Data are lacking about expression of DOCK8 protein in neutrophils or the possible role of DOCK8 in neutrophil function. We sought to determine if DOCK8 protein is expressed in neutrophils and if DOCK8 plays a role in neutrophil function. The expression of DOCK8 protein was assessed in neutrophils from healthy volunteers with and without activators. Neutrophil chemotaxis, phagocytosis and superoxide generation were studied in neutrophils from DOCK8-deficient patients compared to neutrophils from healthy controls before and after stimulation with activators: phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) or N-Formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). DOCK8 protein is expressed in resting neutrophils from healthy controls, with a significant increase in DOCK8 expression after stimulation. Neutrophil functions were assessed in 6 DOCK8-deficient patients. All patients had the same non-sense mutation (c.C5134A, p.S1711X). Normal chemotaxis was recorded in 4/6 patients while a mild to moderate chemotaxis defect was recorded in 2/6. Superoxide generation was mainly normal in neutrophils from all six patients and phagocytosis was normal in five patients tested. We conclude that DOCK8 protein is expressed in resting human neutrophils and DOCK8 expression is increased after stimulation with either PMA or fMLP. Most patients with a disease-causing mutation in DOCK8 have normal neutrophil functions, while a minority showed a mild to moderate chemotactic defect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30915065>Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)-Mediated Gut Epithelial and Immune Regulation and Its Relevance for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), collectively known as Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), are caused by a complex interplay between genetic, immunologic, microbial and environmental factors. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome is increasingly considered to be causatively related to IBD and is strongly affected by components of a Western life style. Bacteria that ferment fibers and produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are typically reduced in mucosa and feces of patients with IBD, as compared to healthy individuals. SCFAs, such as , propionate and butyrate, are important metabolites in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Several studies have indeed shown that fecal SCFAs levels are reduced in active IBD. SCFAs are an important fuel for intestinal epithelial cells and are known to strengthen the gut barrier function. Recent findings, however, show that SCFAs, and in particular butyrate, also have important immunomodulatory functions. Absorption of SCFAs is facilitated by substrate transporters like MCT1 and SMCT1 to promote cellular metabolism. Moreover, SCFAs may signal through cell surface G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), like GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109A, to activate signaling cascades that control immune functions. Transgenic mouse models support the key role of these GPCRs in controlling intestinal inflammation. Here, we present an overview of microbial SCFAs production and their effects on the intestinal mucosa with specific emphasis on their relevance for IBD. Moreover, we discuss the therapeutic potential of SCFAs for IBD, either applied directly or by stimulating SCFAs-producing bacteria through pre- or probiotic approaches.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30357309>Pharmacological inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome reduces blood pressure, renal damage, and dysfunction in salt-sensitive hypertension.</a></h2><p>Renal inflammation, leading to fibrosis and impaired function is a major contributor to the development of hypertension. The NLRP3 inflammasome mediates inflammation in several chronic diseases by processing the cytokines pro-interleukin (IL)-1β and pro-IL-18. In this study, we investigated whether MCC950, a recently-identified inhibitor of NLRP3 activity, reduces blood pressure (BP), renal inflammation, fibrosis and dysfunction in mice with established hypertension.C57BL6/J mice were made hypertensive by uninephrectomy and treatment with deoxycorticosterone  (2.4 mg/day, s.c.) and 0.9% NaCl in the drinking water (1K/DOCA/salt). Normotensive controls were uninephrectomized and received normal drinking water. Ten days later, mice were treated with MCC950 (10 mg/kg/day, s.c.) or vehicle (saline, s.c.) for up to 25 days. BP was monitored by tail-cuff or radiotelemetry; renal function by biochemical analysis of 24-h urine collections; and kidney inflammation/pathology was assessed by real-time PCR for inflammatory gene expression, flow cytometry for leucocyte influx, and Picrosirius red histology for collagen. Over the 10 days post-surgery, 1K/DOCA/salt-treated mice became hypertensive, developed impaired renal function, and displayed elevated renal levels of inflammatory markers, collagen and immune cells. MCC950 treatment from day 10 attenuated 1K/DOCA/salt-induced increases in renal expression of inflammasome subunits (NLRP3, ASC, pro-caspase-1) and inflammatory/injury markers (pro-IL-18, pro-IL-1β, IL-17A, TNF-α, osteopontin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, CCL2, vimentin), each by 25-40%. MCC950 reduced interstitial collagen and accumulation of certain leucocyte subsets in kidneys of 1K/DOCA/salt-treated mice, including CD206+ (M2-like) macrophages and interferon-gamma-producing T cells. Finally, MCC950 partially reversed 1K/DOCA/salt-induced elevations in BP, urine output, osmolality, [Na+], and albuminuria (each by 20-25%). None of the above parameters were altered by MCC950 in normotensive mice.MCC950 was effective at reducing BP and limiting renal inflammation, fibrosis and dysfunction in mice with established hypertension. This study provides proof-of-concept that pharmacological inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome is a viable anti-hypertensive strategy.© The Author(s) 2018.

Canine strongyloidosis is generally characterised by diarrhoea, malabsorption and bronchopneumonia, and may be fatal in cases of impaired . In recent years, molecular and epidemiological studies suggested that host-adapted populations of S. stercoralis with different zoonotic potential may exist. Clinical and subclinical cases of S. stercoralis infection have been increasingly diagnosed in imported (France, Belgium, Bulgaria) and locally born dogs in Switzerland, showing that this parasite is currently circulating in Europe. Three of these clinical cases will be described here. All three dogs presented severe disease, characterised by harsh diarrhoea, dehydration, vomiting, respiratory and/or neurologic signs, and needed intensive care and hospitalisation. One of these dogs was related to a Swiss breeding kennel, in which the infection was subsequently diagnosed in several other dogs. Faeces were analysed by three coproscopical methods including (i) the Baermann technique, which consistently identified the typical S. stercoralis first-stage larvae in both clinical and subclinical infections, (ii) the sedimentation-zinc chloride flotation and (iii) sodium -acetic acid-formalin concentration (SAFC) methods, which allowed the additional identification of parasitic females and/or eggs in two of the clinical cases. Interestingly, S. stercoralis isolated from all three independent clinical cases exhibited an identical genetic background on the nuclear 18S rDNA (fragment involving hypervariable regions I and IV) and the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (cox1) loci, similar to that of zoonotic isolates from other geographical regions, and not to that of dog-adapted variants. Due to the clinical relevance and zoonotic potential of this parasite, the awareness of both diagnosticians and clinicians is strongly required.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28993516>Mechanisms of the Innate Defense Regulator Peptide-1002 Anti-Inflammatory Activity in a Sterile Inflammation Mouse Model.</a></h2><p>Innate defense regulator (IDR) peptide-1002 is a synthetic host defense peptide derivative with strong anti-inflammatory properties. Extending previous data, IDR-1002 suppressed in vitro inflammatory responses in RAW 264.7 murine monocyte/macrophage cells challenged with the TLR4 agonist LPS and TLR2 agonists lipoteichoic acid and zymosan. To investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of IDR-1002 in vivo, the PMA-induced mouse ear inflammation model was used. Topical IDR-1002 treatment successfully dampened PMA-induced ear edema, proinflammatory cytokine production, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species release, and neutrophil recruitment in the ears of CD1 mice. Advanced RNA transcriptomic analysis on the mouse ear transcriptome revealed that IDR-1002 reduced sterile inflammation by suppressing the expression of transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (class A/1 rhodopsin-like), including receptors for chemokines, PGs, histamine, platelet activating factor, and anaphylatoxin. IDR-1002 also dampened the IFN-γ response and repressed the IFN regulatory factor 8-regulated network that controls central inflammatory pathways. This study demonstrates that IDR-1002 exhibits strong in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory activities, informs the underlying anti-inflammatory mechanisms, and reveals its potential as a novel therapeutic for inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29241587>Associations between infant fungal and bacterial dysbiosis and childhood atopic wheeze in a nonindustrialized setting.</a></h2><p>Asthma is the most prevalent chronic disease of childhood. Recently, we identified a critical window early in the life of both mice and Canadian infants during which gut microbial changes (dysbiosis) affect asthma development. Given geographic differences in human gut microbiota worldwide, we studied the effects of gut microbial dysbiosis on atopic wheeze in a population living in a distinct developing world environment.We sought to determine whether microbial alterations in early infancy are associated with the development of atopic wheeze in a nonindustrialized setting.We conducted a case-control study nested within a birth cohort from rural Ecuador in which we identified 27 children with atopic wheeze and 70 healthy control subjects at 5 years of age. We analyzed bacterial and eukaryotic gut microbiota in stool samples collected at 3 months of age using 16S and 18S sequencing. Bacterial metagenomes were predicted from 16S rRNA data by using Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States and categorized by function with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ontology. Concentrations of fecal short-chain fatty acids were determined by using gas chromatography.As previously observed in Canadian infants, microbial dysbiosis at 3 months of age was associated with later development of atopic wheeze. However, the dysbiosis in Ecuadorian babies involved different bacterial taxa, was more pronounced, and also involved several fungal taxa. Predicted metagenomic analysis emphasized significant dysbiosis-associated differences in genes involved in carbohydrate and taurine metabolism. Levels of the fecal short-chain fatty acids  and caproate were reduced and increased, respectively, in the 3-month stool samples of children who went on to have atopic wheeze.Our findings support the importance of fungal and bacterial microbiota during the first 100 days of life on the development of atopic wheeze and provide additional support for considering modulation of the gut microbiome as a primary asthma prevention strategy.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Herein, we have improved upon our initial emulsion-based formulation of Ace-DEX MPs encapsulating AR-12 (AR-12/MPs) by improving the drug encapsulation efficiency, evaluating sterilization processes for manufacturing, and understanding cellular and in vivo trafficking of the MPs. By using an alternative solvent system, ethyl , we report an increased encapsulation efficiency of AR-12 while maintaining the pH-responsive degradation kinetics of Ace-DEX MPs. To better manufacture this novel antimicrobial formulation, we sterilized AR-12/MPs by gamma irradiation or ethylene oxide and evaluated their efficacy against intracellular Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. Sterilized AR-12/MPs resulted in a significant reduction in intracellular bacterial burden compared to Blank/MPs. We also characterized intracellular trafficking of Ace-DEX MPs encapsulating fluorophores, which demonstrated internalization of MPs in endo/lysosomal compartments and time and degradation-rate dependent lysosomal escape into cytosolic compartments. Additionally, in vivo toxicity was mitigated following encapsulation of AR-12, where the maximum tolerated dose of AR-12 was increased compared to soluble treatment via intranasal, intravenous, and intraperitoneal administration routes. Following in vivo trafficking of Ace-DEX MPs via the same routes, intranasal administration demonstrated the highest accumulation in the lungs, liver, and kidneys, which persisted out to 240 h.

It is estimated that approximately 75% of treatment-resistant hypertension cases have an underlying OSA. Exploration of the gut microbiome is a new advance in medicine that has been linked to many comorbid illnesses, including SH and OSA. Here, we will review the literature in SH and gut dysbiosis, OSA and gut dysbiosis, and whether gut dysbiosis is common in both conditions.We reviewed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, including PubMed and PubMed Central. We identified a total of 230 articles. The literature search was conducted using the phrase "obstructive sleep apnea and gut dysbiosis." Only original research articles were included. This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis, however, can cause a state of low-grade inflammation through damage to the gut wall barrier resulting in "leaky gut." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH.Gut dysbiosis seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension. Reversing gut dysbiosis at an early stage through prebiotics and probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation combined with positive airway pressure therapy may open new horizons of treatment to prevent SH.

Recent studies have shown that the CXCR5CD8 T cells present more potent proinflammatory function than CXCR5CD8 T cells in chronic virus infections and in follicular lymphoma, but the role of CXCR5CD8 T cells in colorectal cancer is yet unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that CXCR5CD8 T cells were very rare in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy and colorectal cancer individuals, but were significantly enriched in resected tumors and tumor-associated lymph nodes. Compared to CXCR5CD8 T cells, the CXCR5CD8 T cells demonstrated significantly higher Bcl-6 expression and lower Blimp1 expression, suggesting that CXCR5CD8 T cells might represent a memory CD8 T cell subset. CXCR5CD8 T cells also enhanced the IgG expression by autologous B cells. Under ex vivo condition, the CXCR5CD8 T cells demonstrated lower degranulation, TNFα expression and IFNγ expression than CXCR5CD8 T cells. However, after PMA + ionomycin stimulation, the degranulation and TNFα expression by CXCR5CD8 T cells were significantly elevated to a level comparable with CXCR5CD8 T cells, whereas the IFNγ expression by PMA + ionomycin-stimulated CXCR5CD8 T cells were significantly higher than that by CXCR5CD8 T cells. Following long-term TCR-stimulation, CXCR5CD8 T cells demonstrated significantly more potent proliferation capacity and higher IFNγ expression than CXCR5CD8 T cells.

To assess activation of human and mouse cellular , early activation markers of lymphocytes are often used in flow cytometry targeting expression of CD69 molecules. Response of humoral  against infection or vaccination has been well investigated in pigs, but that of cellular  has been largely neglected due to lack of direct evaluation tools.

Glucose is metabolized through fermentative glycolysis, producing ethanol as its main end-product as well as some . Amoebal glycolysis markedly differs from the typical Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway present in human cells: (i) by the use of inorganic pyrophosphate, instead of ATP, as the high-energy phospho group donor; (ii) with one exception, the pathway enzymes can catalyze reversible reactions under physiological conditions; (iii) there is no allosteric regulation and sigmoidal kinetic behavior of key enzymes; and (iv) the presence of some glycolytic and fermentation enzymes similar to those of anaerobic bacteria. These peculiarities bring about alternative mechanisms of control and regulation of the PPi-dependent fermentative glycolysis in the parasite in comparison to the ATP-dependent and allosterically regulated glycolysis in many other eukaryotic cells. In this review, the current knowledge of the carbohydrate metabolism enzymes in E. histolytica is analyzed. Thermodynamics and stoichiometric analyses indicate 2 to 3.5 ATP yield per glucose metabolized, instead of the often presumed 5 ATP/glucose ratio. PPi derived from anabolism seems insufficient for PPi-glycolysis; hence, alternative ways of PPi supply are also discussed. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of control and regulation of the E. histolytica carbohydrate metabolism, analyzed by applying integral and systemic approaches such as Metabolic Control Analysis and kinetic modeling, contribute to unveiling alternative and promising drug targets.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Like enterocytes, EEs express components of the immune deficiency (IMD) innate immune pathway, which activates transcription of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides. The discovery of large lipid droplets in intestines of IMD pathway mutants prompted us to investigate the role of the IMD pathway in the host metabolic response to its intestinal microbiota. Here we provide evidence that the short-chain fatty acid  is a microbial metabolic signal that activates signaling through the enteroendocrine IMD pathway in a PGRP-LC-dependent manner. This, in turn, increases transcription of the gene encoding the endocrine peptide Tachykinin (Tk), which is essential for timely larval development and optimal lipid metabolism and insulin signaling.

The crabs were exposed to 0.066, 0.132, 1.318, 2.636, 6.590, and 13.181 μM of lead  and a control over 30 days, and the hemolymph was sampled terminally for testing the -related indices, including total hemocyte count (THC), hemocyanin content, the activities of the phenoloxidase (PO) and lysozyme (LSZ). In addition, tissue samples were collected from the hepatopancreas, gill, muscle and ovary after 30 days of exposure for detecting the Pb accumulation in the major organs. The gene expression profiles of metallothionein (MT) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in the hepatopancreas of C. japonica upon exposure to lead  over 96 h were also analyzed. The results showed a decline in the majority of the -related parameters after an initial rise, and their levels were significantly lower in the treatment groups compared with those in the control, except in the group exposed to 0.066 μM of lead  for 30 days. Furthermore, a significant negative correlation was observed between the lead  concentration and the hemocyanin content, the activities of PO and LSZ (P<0.01). The expression levels of MT and HSP70 genes were rapidly induced, reaching a peak level after 12 and 24 h of exposure, respectively, and remained at a significantly higher level than the control after 96 h of exposure. It was also observed that the distribution pattern of Pb in the tissues of exposed crabs was in the order of gill > hepatopancreas > ovary and muscle, and exhibited a concentration-dependent response. Taken together, the results revealed that Pb exposure induced the immunosuppression of C. japonica and resulted in bioaccumulation, which could subsequently increase the disease susceptibility and threaten the food safety.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

There is a need for novel dietary treatments for CD.We evaluated the effects of an individualized food-based diet (CD-TREAT), with similar composition to EEN, on the gut microbiome, inflammation, and clinical response in a rat model, healthy adults, and children with relapsing CD. Twenty-five healthy adults randomly received EEN or CD-TREAT for 7 days, followed by a 14-day washout period, followed by the alternate diet. Fecal microbiome and metabolome were assessed before and after each diet. HLA-B7 and HLA-B27 transgenic rats with gut inflammation received EEN, CD-TREAT, or standard chow for 4 weeks. Fecal, luminal, and tissue microbiome, fecal metabolites, and gut inflammation were assessed. Five children with active CD activity received CD-TREAT and their clinical activity and calprotectin were evaluated after 8 weeks of treatment.For healthy adults, CD-TREAT was easier to comply with and more acceptable than EEN. CD-TREAT induced similar effects to EEN (EEN vs CD-TREAT) on fecal microbiome composition, metabolome, mean total sulfide (increase 133.0 ± 80.5 vs 54.3 ± 47.0 nmol/g), pH (increase 1.3 ± 0.5 vs 0.9 ± 0.6), and the short-chain fatty acids (μmol/g)  (decrease 27.4 ± 22.6 vs 21.6 ± 20.4), propionate (decrease 5.7 ± 7.8 vs 5.2 ± 7.9), and butyrate (decrease 7.0 ± 7.4 vs 10.2 ± 8.5). In the rat model, CD-TREAT and EEN produced similar changes in bacterial load (decrease 0.3 ± 0.3 log 16S rRNA gene copies per gram), short-chain fatty acids, microbiome, and ileitis severity (mean histopathology score decreases of 1.25 for EEN [P = .015] and 1.0 for CD-TREAT [P = .044] vs chow). In children receiving CD-TREAT, 4 (80%) had a clinical response and 3 (60%) entered remission, with significant concurrent decreases in fecal calprotectin (mean decrease 918 ± 555 mg/kg; P = .002).CD-TREAT replicates EEN changes in the microbiome, decreases gut inflammation, is well tolerated, and is potentially effective in patients with active CD.

The aim of this study was to further investigate the influence of immunomodulatory therapies on the antibody response and seroprotection rates in patients immunized with seasonal influenza vaccine in 2012/2013 compared with healthy controls.Ninety patients receiving fingolimod, glatiramer , interferon beta-1a/1b, natalizumab or no therapy were compared with 62 healthy controls. All subjects received the inactivated split virus vaccine in 2012 and serum samples were collected pre-vaccination and 3, 6 and 12 months post-vaccination. The vaccine responses were evaluated by the hemagglutination inhibition assay and adjusted for age and gender.No significant differences in rates of protection against H1N1 for interferon beta-1a/1b and glatiramer  were observed as compared with controls at 3, 6 and 12 months. Fingolimod provided reduced protection at all time points post-vaccination, whereas natalizumab displayed reduced protection at 3 and 6 months. Patients without immunomodulation did not display protection rates that were significantly different from the controls at 3 and 12 months.These findings suggest that patients with multiple sclerosis receiving fingolimod or natalizumab should be considered for a second dose of the vaccine in cases of insufficient protection. Our results further indicate that new immunomodulatory treatment regimens should be systematically evaluated for their influence on influenza-specific vaccine responses.© 2017 EAN.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29970564>Phagocytic Activation of Macrophages with Serum MAF Depends on Engulfment Efficiency and Not Migratory Activity.</a></h2><p>Serum-derived macrophage activating factor (serum MAF) is known to increase the phagocytic activity of macrophages and potentially plays a role in activating cancer .

In the current study, in vivo and in vitro methods were used to investigate the regulation of the rainbow trout invariant chain proteins S25-7 and INVX, upon immune system activation. Whole rainbow trout and the macrophage/monocyte-like cell line RTS11 were treated with PMA at concentrations shown to induce IL-1β transcripts and homotypic aggregation of RTS11. S25-7 transcript levels remained unchanged in the gill, spleen, and liver and were found to be significantly decreased in head kidney beginning 24 h post-stimulation. Meanwhile, INVX transcript levels remained unchanged in all tissues studied. Both S25-7 and INVX proteins were produced in gill and spleen tissues but their expression was unaffected by immune system stimulation. Surprisingly, neither INVX nor S25-7 protein was detected in the secondary immune organ, the head kidney. Analysis of RTS11 cultures demonstrated that both INVX and S25-7 transcript levels significantly increased at 96 h and 120 h following PMA stimulation before returning to control levels at 168 h. Meanwhile, at the protein level in RTS11, S25-7 remained unchanged while INVX had a significant decrease at 168 h post-stimulation. These results indicate that neither INVX nor S25-7 is upregulated upon immune system activation; thus, teleosts have evolved a system of immune regulation that is different than that found in mammals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29105632>Combinational effects of non n-Hexane Fractions of ant-plant (Myrmecodia tuberosa Jack) hypocotyl with doxorubicin against lymphocyte and cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Doxorubicin is widely used as a chemotherapeutic drug despite having many side effects. It may cause the dysfunction of macrophage, decreasing proliferation of lymphocytes, decreasing CD4+/CD8+ ratio and inducing hepatotoxicity. Doxorubicin inhibits the growth of Vero, HeLa, and T47D cell lines, and also induces a resistance of MCF-7 cells. Previous studies showed that ethanolic extract and ethyl  fraction of ant-plant (Myrmecodia tuberose Jack) hipocotyl could increase macrophage phagocytosis activity and lymphocyte proliferation in vitro. Therefore, antplant is a potential immune stimulator. Combinational treatment of non n-hexane fraction (NHF) of ant-plant with doxorubicin did not affect the doxorubicin's potency. Nevertheless, increased lymphocyte viability induced by doxorubicin in varied dosages of NHF that lethal to HeLa, MCF-7 and T47D cells. Moreover, on Vero cells, doxorubicin became less toxic when induced together with NHF.

They do not receive early enteral feeding and have limited opportunities for skin to skin contact with their mothers. Many of these infants receive gastric acid suppression therapies. All these factors increase the risk of gut dysbiosis in these infants. Gut dysbiosis is known to be associated with increased risk of infections and other morbidities in ICU patients. Experimental studies have shown that probiotics inhibit gut colonization with pathogenic bacteria, enhance gut barrier function, facilitate colonization with healthy commensals, protect from enteropathogenic infection through production of , reduce antimicrobial resistance, enhance innate , and increase the maturation of the enteric nervous system and promote gut peristalsis. Through these mechanisms, probiotics have the potential to decrease the risk of sepsis and inflammation, improve feed tolerance and minimise cholestasis in neonates with CGISC. Among preterm non-surgical infants, evidence from more than 35 RCTs and multiple observational studies have shown probiotics to be safe and beneficial. A RCT in neonates (N=24) with gastroschisis found that probiotic supplementation partially attenuated gut dysbiosis. Two ongoing RCTs (total N=168) in neonates with gastrointestinal surgical conditions are expected to provide feasibility data to enable the conduct of large RCTs. Rigorous quality assurance of the probiotic product, ongoing microbial surveillance and clinical vigilance are warranted while conducting such RCTs.© 2018 The Authors.

Antibiotics have an immunomodulating effect, and they can influence the properties of numerous immune cells, including neutrophils. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of azithromycin and chloramphenicol on degranulation, apoptosis, respiratory burst, and the release of NETs by neutrophils. Neutrophils were isolated from healthy donors by density-gradient centrifugation method and incubated for 1 h with the studied antibiotics at different concentrations (0.5, 10 and 50 μg/mL-azithromycin and 10 and 50 μg/mL-chloramphenicol). Next, NET release was induced by a 3 h incubation with 100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA). Amount of extracellular DNA was quantified by fluorometry, and NETs were visualized by immunofluorescent microscopy. Degranulation, apoptosis and respiratory burst were assessed by flow cytometry. We found that pretreatment of neutrophils with azithromycin and chloramphenicol decreases the release of NETs. Moreover, azithromycin showed a concentration-dependent effect on respiratory burst in neutrophils. Chloramphenicol did not affect degranulation, apoptosis nor respiratory burst.

To further define a potential contribution of the T2R38 receptor in adaptive immune response, the objective of this study was to analyze its expression in resting and activated lymphocytes and T cell subpopulations. Freshly isolated PBMC from healthy donors were used for expression analysis by flow cytometry. Quantum™ MESF beads were applied for quantification in absolute fluorescence units. Activation methods of T cells were anti-CD3/CD28, phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) or phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) together with ionomycin. Lymphocytes from young donors expressed higher levels of T2R38 compared to the elderly. CD3+ T cells expressed higher levels that CD19+ B cells. Receptor expression followed T cell activation with an upregulation within 24 h and a peak at 72 h. Higher levels of T2R38 were produced in lymphocytes by stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 compared to PHA or PMA/ionomycin. Both subpopulations of CD4+ as well as CD8+ T cells were found to express the T2R38 receptor; this was higher in CD4+ than CD8+ cells; the amount of T2R38 in central and effector memory cells was higher as compared to naïve cells, although this was not statistically significant for CD8+ cells without prior activation by anti-CD3/CD28. Upon treatment of PBMC with the natural T2R38 agonist goitrin Calcium flux was activated in the lymphocyte population with functional T2R38 receptor at >20 μM which was completely blocked by phospholipase Cβ-2 inhibitor U73211. Further, goitrin selectively inhibited TNF-alpha secretion in PBMC with functional T2R38. This quantitative analysis of T2R38 expression in distinct PBMC subsets may provide a basis for understanding the significance of bitter compounds in immune modulation. Whether these findings can have implications for the treatment of inflammatory and immunologic disorders by bitter tasting pharmaceuticals or foods needs further investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30222141>Use of contraceptive depot medroxyprogesterone  is associated with impaired cervicovaginal mucosal integrity.</a></h2><p>Injectable depot medroxyprogesterone  (DMPA) is one of the most popular contraception methods in areas of high HIV seroprevalence. Evidence is accumulating that use of DMPA might be associated with an increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition by women; however, mechanisms of this association are not completely understood. The goal of this study was to gain insight into mechanisms underlying the possible link between use of DMPA and risk of HIV-1 acquisition, exploring transcription profiling of ectocervical tissues.Healthy women received either DMPA (n = 31) or combined oral contraceptive (COC), which has not been linked to an increased risk of HIV acquisition (n = 32). We conducted a comparative microarray-based whole-genome transcriptome profiling of human ectocervical tissues before and after 6 weeks of hormonal contraception use.The analysis identified that expression of 235 and 76 genes was significantly altered after DMPA and COC use, respectively. The most striking effect of DMPA, but not COC, was significantly altered expression (mostly downregulation) of many genes strategically involved in the maintenance of mucosal barrier function; the alterations, as indicated by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), were most likely due to the DMPA-induced estrogen deficiency. Furthermore, IPA predicted that transcriptome alterations related to ectocervical immune responses were in general compatible with an immunosuppressive effect of DMPA, but, in some women, also with an inflammatory-like response.Our results suggest that impairment of cervicovaginal mucosal integrity in response to DMPA administration is an important mechanism contributing to the potential increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition in DMPA users.ClinicalTrials.gov .This study was supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under Cooperative Agreement GPO-A-00-08-00005-00.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29184852>A New Determinant of  Virulence: The  Exporter CgDtr1.</a></h2><p>Persistence and virulence of  infections are multifactorial phenomena, whose understanding is crucial to design more suitable therapeutic strategies.

Enhanced cerebral recruitment of monocytes achieved through glatiramer  (GA) immunization or peripheral blood enrichment with bone marrow (BM)-derived CD115 monocytes (Mo) curbs amyloid β-protein (Aβ) neuropathology and preserves cognitive function in murine models of Alzheimer's disease (ADtg mice). To elucidate the beneficial mechanisms of these immunomodulatory approaches in AD, we focused on the potential role of OPN in macrophage-mediated Aβ clearance. Here, we found extensive OPN upregulation along with reduction of vascular and parenchymal Aβ burden in cortices and hippocampi of GA-immunized ADtg mice. Treatment combining GA with blood-grafted Mo further increased OPN levels surrounding residual Aβ plaques. In brains from AD patients and ADtg mice, OPN was also elevated and predominantly expressed by infiltrating GFP- or Iba1-CD45 monocyte-derived macrophages engulfing Aβ plaques. Following GA immunization, we detected a significant increase in a subpopulation of inflammatory blood monocytes (CD115CD11bLy6C) expressing OPN, and subsequently, an elevated population of OPN-expressing CD11bLy6CCD45 monocyte/macrophages in the brains of these ADtg mice. Correlogram analyses indicate a strong linear correlation between cerebral OPN levels and macrophage infiltration, as well as a tight inverse relation between OPN and Aβ-plaque burden. In vitro studies corroborate in vivo findings by showing that GA directly upregulates OPN expression in BM-derived macrophages (MФ). Further, OPN promotes a phenotypic shift that is highly phagocytic (increased uptake of Aβ fibrils and surface scavenger receptors) and anti-inflammatory (altered cell morphology, reduced iNOS, and elevated IL-10 and Aβ-degrading enzyme MMP-9). Inhibition of OPN expression in MФ, either by siRNA, knockout (KO), or minocycline, impairs uptake of Aβ fibrils and hinders GA's neuroprotective effects on macrophage immunological profile. Addition of human recombinant OPN reverses the impaired Aβ phagocytosis in KO-MФ. This study demonstrates that OPN has an essential role in modulating macrophage immunological profile and their ability to resist pathogenic forms of Aβ.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

Mast cells are involved in innate  but no data have been presented on effects of LL-37 on human mast cell viability and export of nucleic acids. Here, we demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy that synthesized LL-37 was internalized by human LAD2 mast cells and detected both in cytoplasm and nucleus. Treatment with high (4 and 10 μM) but not low (1 μM) concentrations of LL-37 for 4 h reduced cell viability assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Stimulation with 10 μM LL-37 for 4 h enhanced export of nucleic acids, total protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), suggesting that both nuclear and plasma membranes are permeabilized by LL-37. Although LL-37 triggered release of nucleic acids, no extracellular trap-like structures were observed by laser scanning confocal microscopy of cells incubated with the plasma membrane impermeable nucleic acid fluorophore SYTOX-Green, indicating that LL-37 promotes export of nucleic acids but not formation of extracellular traps. On the other hand, phorbol-12-myristate-13- (PMA), which is a well-known inducer of extracellular traps, stimulated export of nucleic acids and also formation of extracellular trap-like structures. However, PMA had no effect on export of either total protein or LDH. Hence, LL-37 and PMA seem to stimulate export of nucleic acids from LAD2 mast cells through different pathways. In conclusion, we demonstrate that LL-37 triggers release of nucleic acids from human mast cells but not the formation of extracellular trap-like structures.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The cells of most concern, T lymphocytes, coordinate the host response against microbial and cancerous challenges leading to elimination and long-term protection. T cells are activated upon recognition of specific microbial peptides bound on the surface of antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DC). Subsequently, this engagement results in T cell proliferation and differentiation into effector T cells driven by autocrine interleukin-2 (IL-2) and other cytokines. Finally, the effector T cells acquire the weaponry needed to destroy microbial invaders and tumors. Studies conducted on T cells during spaceflight, or using Earth-based culture systems, have shown reduced production of cytokines, proliferation and effector functions as compared to controls. This may account for the cases of viral reactivation events and opportunistic infections associated with astronauts of numerous missions. This work has largely been based upon the outcome of T cell activation by stimulatory factors that target select T cell signaling pathways rather than the complex, signaling events related to the natural process of antigen presentation by DC. This study tested the response of an ovalbumin peptide-specific T cell line, OT-II TCH, to activation by DC when the T cells were cultured 24-120 h in a simulated microgravity (SMG) environment generated by a rotary cell culture system. Following 72 h culture of T cells in SMG (SMG-T) or control static (Static-T) conditions, IL-2 production by the T cells was reduced in SMG-T cells compared to Static-T cells upon stimulation by phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) and ionomycin. However, when the SMG-T cells were stimulated with DC and peptide, IL-2 was significantly increased compared to Static-T cells. Such enhanced IL-2 production by SMG-T cells peaked at 72 h SMG culture time and decreased thereafter. When activation of SMG-T cells occurred in SMG, the T cells produced less IL-2 than control T cell cultures upon incubation with PMA and ionomycin. Short-term (24 h) SMG culture and activation of T cells by DC resulted in enhanced IL-2 production compared to Static-T cells, however, when culture was extended to 120 h, SMG-T cells secreted significantly less IL-2 than Static-T cells. SMG-T cell IL-2 doubled upon stimulation of the DC prior to addition to the T cell culture but remained less than control. SMG-T cell resistance to activation appeared comparable to the phenomenon of T cell exhaustion observed in patients with chronic diseases or persistent tumors. That is, long-term culture of T cells in SMG resulted in increased expression of the inhibitory receptor, CTLA-4. Blockade of CTLA-4 interaction with DC ligands resulted in improved T cell IL-2 production. Overall, this is the first study to determine the efficacy of DC in activating peptide-specific T cells. Furthermore, the findings suggests that countermeasures to restore T cell responsiveness in astronauts during long-term spaceflight or those living in microgravity environments should target possible inhibitory pathways that arise on activated T cells following stimulation.Copyright © 2017 The Committee on Space Research (COSPAR).

NETosis is the metamorphosis of neutrophils with NET formation that follows decondensation of DNA and rupture of the plasma membrane. Although NETs play important roles in innate , excessive formation of NETs can be harmful to the hosts. Until now, various methods for evaluation of NETs have been reported. Although each has a virtue, the gold standard has not been established. Here we demonstrate a simple, objective, and quantitative method to detect NETs using flow cytometry. This method uses a plasma membrane-impermeable DNA-binding dye, SYTOX Green. SYTOX Green-positive cells were detected in human peripheral polymorphonuclear cells exposed to a NET inducer, phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA). The number of SYTOX Green-positive cells was increased depending on the exposure duration and concentrations of PMA. Furthermore, co-localization of MPO and plasma membrane-appendant DNA of SYTOX Green-positive cells was demonstrated. Moreover, a NET inhibitor, diphenylene iodonium, could significantly reduce the number of SYTOX Green-positive cells induced by PMA. The collective evidence suggests that SYTOX Green-positive cells include neutrophils that formed NETs. The established method could detect neutrophils that underwent NETosis but not early apoptosis with equivalence in quantification to another well-used image analysis, which is based on fluorescent staining. Additionally, NETs that were formed in vivo were also detectable by this method.

Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-associated disorder with an immune basis and is linked to atopic disorders in offspring. Here we show reduction of fetal thymic size, altered thymic architecture and reduced fetal thymic regulatory T (Treg) cell output in preeclamptic pregnancies, which persists up to 4 years of age in human offspring. In germ-free mice, fetal thymic CD4 T cell and Treg cell development are compromised, but rescued by maternal supplementation with the intestinal bacterial metabolite short chain fatty acid (SCFA) , which induces upregulation of the autoimmune regulator (AIRE), known to contribute to Treg cell generation. In our human cohorts, low maternal serum  is associated with subsequent preeclampsia, and correlates with serum  in the fetus. These findings suggest a potential role of  in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia and immune development in offspring.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30030149>Abnormal neutrophil traps and impaired efferocytosis contribute to liver injury and sepsis severity after binge alcohol use.</a></h2><p>Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are an important strategy utilized by neutrophils to immobilize and kill invading microorganisms. Herein, we studied NET formation and the process of neutrophil cell death (NETosis), as well as the clearance of NETs by macrophages (MΦ) (efferocytosis) in acute sepsis following binge drinking.Healthy volunteers consumed 2 ml of vodka/kg body weight, before blood endotoxin and 16 s rDNA were measured. Peripheral neutrophils were isolated and exposed to alcohol followed by phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) stimulation. Mice were treated with three alcohol binges and intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to assess the dynamics of NET formation and efferocytosis. In vivo, anti-Ly6G antibody (IA8) was used for neutrophil depletion.Inducers of NETs (endotoxin and bacterial DNA) significantly increased in the circulation after binge alcohol drinking in humans. Ex vivo, alcohol alone increased NET formation, but upon PMA stimulation alcohol attenuated NET formation. Binge alcohol in mice resulted in a biphasic response to LPS. Initially, binge alcohol reduced LPS-induced NET formation and resulted in a diffuse distribution of neutrophils in the liver compared to alcohol-naïve mice. Moreover, indicators of NET formation including citrullinated histone H3, neutrophil elastase, and neutrophil myeloperoxidase were decreased at an early time point after LPS challenge in mice receiving binge alcohol, suggesting decreased NET formation. However, in the efferocytosis phase (15 h after LPS) citrullinated histone-H3 was increased in the liver in alcohol binge mice, suggesting decreased clearance of NETs. In vitro alcohol treatment reduced efferocytosis and phagocytosis of NETotic neutrophils and promoted expression of CD206 on MΦ. Finally, depletion of neutrophils prior to binge alcohol ameliorated LPS-induced systemic inflammation and liver injury in mice.Dysfunctional NETosis and efferocytosis following binge drinking exacerbate liver injury associated with sepsis.Disease severity in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is associated with a significant presence of neutrophils (a type of immune cell) in the liver. It remains unknown how alcohol affects the capacity of neutrophils to control infection, a major hallmark of ALD. We found that binge alcohol drinking impaired important strategies used by neutrophils to contain and resolve infection, resulting in increased liver injury during ALD.Copyright © 2018 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

In a conventional reporter cell line, a reporter expression construct is randomly inserted into the host cell genome with the reporter gene under control of an engineered promoter. This design ensures high signal output but may not represent the true physiological cell signaling. Here we used the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to engineer a Jurkat cell line by replacing one interleukin 2 (IL2) allele with firefly luciferase gene while keeping the other IL2 allele intact. The expression of luciferase is thus under control of endogenous IL2 promoter. We demonstrated that, in this engineered cell line, the IL-2 secretion pathway remained intact and luciferase activity significantly increased upon stimulation with phorbol ester or CD3/CD28 antibodies. We next expressed glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related protein (GITR) in this cell line and observed dose-dependent IL-2 and luciferase responses to GITR agonist antibody. Thus we have successfully constructed a reporter cell line by engineering a reporter gene under control of an endogenous target gene promoter. This novel strategy may provide a more physiologically relevant alternative to the traditional method of reporter cell line construction.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Better treatment options for leukemia are required due to large number of side effects associated with current therapeutic regimens. In the present study, we sought to determine the pathway of triggering apoptosis of leukemic cells by Ocimum basilicum plant extract. <P> Materials/Methods: Methanolic extract of the plant material was prepared. Crude extract was fractionated into several fractions through column chromatography using ethyl  and n-hexane as eluting solvents. Cell viability of leukemic cells was assessed via Cell titer GLO assay and apoptosis was measured through Annexin V/PI staining. Major Apoptotic markers JNK and Caspases were analyzed through western blotting while pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, CCL2 and CXCL8 using qPCR. Fractions were characterized through LC-MS. <P> Results: The most potent with lowest IC50 values among the fractions were B2 and B3. Cytotoxicity was associated with apoptosis. Apoptosis was found caspase dependent and P-JNK activation was detected sustained. Significant increase in the level of TNF α and decrease in the level of CXCL8 was observed in B2 and B3 fractions treated cells. <P> Conclusion: The fractions of O. basilicum extract were found to kill cells following JNK pathway activation. The excellent results were obtained with B2 and B3 fractions probably due to predominantly Epicatechin and Cinnamic acid derivatives in these fractions.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28833699>Impaired polymorphonuclear neutrophils in the oral cavity of edentulous individuals.</a></h2><p>Oral health is characterized by functional oral polymorphonuclear neutrophils (oPMNs). Edentulism might be associated with a loss of oPMNs because these cells enter the oral cavity primarily through the gingival crevices. The main aim of this study was to investigate the numbers of oPMNs in rinse samples obtained from edentulous (n = 21) and dentate (n = 20) subjects. A second study aim was to investigate possible differences between oPMNs and peripheral blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (cPMNs). Apoptosis/necrosis and cell-activation markers (CD11b, CD63 and CD66b) were analyzed using flow cytometry. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was determined either without stimulation (constitutive) or in response to 10 μM phorbol myristate  or Fusobacterium nucleatum. The edentulous subjects presented with lower oPMN counts and higher percentages of apoptotic/necrotic oPMNs compared with dentate subjects. Furthermore, oPMNs from edentulous donors expressed low levels of all three activation markers and low constitutive ROS. In contrast, oPMNs from dentate subjects expressed high levels of all three activation markers and a higher level of constitutive ROS than cPMNs. When challenged, oPMNs from edentulous subjects showed no upregulation in ROS production, whereas oPMNs from dentate subjects retained their ability to respond to stimulation. The functional characteristics of cPMNs were comparable between edentulous and dentate subjects. This study demonstrates that despite having functional cPMNs, edentulous subjects have low oPMN numbers that are functionally impaired.© 2017 The Authors.

Immune cell populations and cytokines released from 1 × 10 cells/ml cultured in the presence of a panel of stimuli (cytomegalovirus, influenza, , phorbol myristate /ionomycin) and in media alone were quantified. Patient characteristics and infective episodes were captured from clinical records. Immunological variables associated with increased risk for infection in the 3-month period following sample collection were identified using univariate analysis ( < 0.05) and refined with multivariable analysis to define a predictive immune profile.525 stimulant samples with 19,950 stimulant-cytokine combinations across three periods were studied, including 61 episodes of infection. Mitogen-stimulated release of IL3 and IL5 were significantly associated with increased risk for subsequent infection during maintenance therapy. A lower Th1/Th2 ratio and higher cytokine response ratios for IL5 and IL13 during maintenance therapy were also significantly associated with increased risk for infection. On multivariable analysis, only IL5 in response to mitogen stimulation was predictive of infection. The lack of cytokine response and numerical value of immune cells were not predictive of infection.Profiling cytokine release in response to mitogen stimulation can assist with predicting subsequent onset of infection in patients with hematological malignancy during maintenance therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30208917>Mucosal associated invariant T cells from human breast ducts mediate a Th17-skewed response to bacterially exposed breast carcinoma cells.</a></h2><p>Antimicrobial T cells play key roles in the disease progression of cancers arising in mucosal epithelial tissues, such as the colon. However, little is known about microbe-reactive T cells within human breast ducts and whether these impact breast carcinogenesis.Epithelial ducts were isolated from primary human breast tissue samples, and the associated T lymphocytes were characterized using flow cytometric analysis. Functional assays were performed to determine T-cell cytokine secretion in response to bacterially treated human breast carcinoma cells.We show that human breast epithelial ducts contain mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, an innate T-cell population that recognizes specific bacterial metabolites presented by nonclassical MR1 antigen-presenting molecules. The MAIT cell population from breast ducts resembled that of peripheral blood in its innate lymphocyte phenotype (i.e., CD161, PLZF, and interleukin [IL]-18 receptor coexpression), but the breast duct MAIT cell population had a distinct T-cell receptor Vβ use profile and was markedly enriched for IL-17-producing cells compared with blood MAIT cells. Breast carcinoma cells that had been exposed to Escherichia coli activated MAIT cells in an MR1-dependent manner. However, whereas phorbol 12-myristate 13-/ionomycin stimulation induced the production of both interferon-γ and IL-17 by breast duct MAIT cells, bacterially exposed breast carcinoma cells elicited a strongly IL-17-biased response. Breast carcinoma cells also showed upregulated expression of natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) ligands compared with primary breast epithelial cells, and the NKG2D receptor contributed to MAIT cell activation by the carcinoma cells.These results demonstrate that MAIT cells from human breast ducts mediate a selective T-helper 17 cell response to human breast carcinoma cells that were exposed to E. coli. Thus, cues from the breast microbiome and the expression of stress-associated ligands by neoplastic breast duct epithelial cells may shape MAIT cell responses during breast carcinogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30365536>Zinc-dependent substrate-level phosphorylation powers Salmonella growth under nitrosative stress of the innate host response.</a></h2><p>The metabolic processes that enable the replication of intracellular Salmonella under nitrosative stress conditions engendered in the innate response of macrophages are poorly understood. A screen of Salmonella transposon mutants identified the ABC-type high-affinity zinc uptake system ZnuABC as a critical determinant of the adaptation of Salmonella to the nitrosative stress generated by the enzymatic activity of inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase of mononuclear phagocytic cells. NO limits the virulence of a znuB mutant in an acute murine model of salmonellosis. The ZnuABC transporter is crucial for the glycolytic function of fructose bisphosphate aldolase, thereby fueling growth of Salmonella during nitrosative stress produced in the innate response of macrophages. Our investigations demonstrate that glycolysis mediates resistance of Salmonella to the antimicrobial activity of NO produced in an acute model of infection. The ATP synthesized by substrate-level phosphorylation at the payoff phase of glycolysis and  fermentation powers the replication of Salmonella experiencing high levels of nitrosative stress. In contrast, despite its high potential for ATP synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation is a major target of inhibition by NO and contributes little to the antinitrosative defenses of intracellular Salmonella. Our investigations have uncovered a previously unsuspected conjunction between zinc homeostasis, glucose metabolism and cellular energetics in the adaptation of intracellular Salmonella to the reactive nitrogen species synthesized in the innate host response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28740333>Mold Alkaloid Cytochalasin D Modifies the Morphology and Secretion of fMLP-, LPS-, or PMA-Stimulated Neutrophils upon Adhesion to Fibronectin.</a></h2><p>Neutrophils play an essential role in innate  due to their ability to migrate into infected tissues and kill microbes with bactericides located in their secretory granules. Neutrophil transmigration and degranulation are tightly regulated by actin cytoskeleton. Invading pathogens produce alkaloids that cause the depolymerization of actin, such as the mold alkaloid cytochalasin D. We studied the effect of cytochalasin D on the morphology and secretion of fMLP-, LPS-, or PMA-stimulated human neutrophils upon adhesion to fibronectin. Electron microscopy showed that the morphology of the neutrophils adherent to fibronectin in the presence of various stimuli differed. But in the presence of cytochalasin D, all stimulated neutrophils exhibited a uniform nonspread shape and developed thread-like membrane tubulovesicular extensions (cytonemes) measuring 200 nm in diameter. Simultaneous detection of neutrophil secretory products by mass spectrometry showed that all tested stimuli caused the secretion of MMP-9, a key enzyme in the neutrophil migration. Cytochalasin D impaired the MMP-9 secretion but initiated the release of cathepsin G and other granular bactericides, proinflammatory agents. The release of bactericides apparently occurs through the formation, shedding, and lysis of cytonemes. The production of alkaloids which modify neutrophil responses to stimulation via actin depolymerization may be part of the strategy of pathogen invasion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28431214>Interferon-γ Released by Activated CD8 T Lymphocytes Impairs the Calcium Resorption Potential of Osteoclasts in Calcified Human Aortic Valves.</a></h2><p>In calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD), activated T lymphocytes localize with osteoclast regions; however, the functional consequences of this association remain unknown. We hypothesized that CD8 T cells modulate calcification in CAVD. CAVD valves (n = 52) dissected into noncalcified and calcified portions were subjected to mRNA extraction, real-time quantitative PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunohistochemical analyses. Compared with noncalcified portions, calcified regions exhibited elevated transcripts for CD8, interferon (IFN)-γ, CXCL9, Perforin 1, Granzyme B, and heat shock protein 60. Osteoclast-associated receptor activator of NK-κB ligand (RANKL), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), and osteoclast-associated receptor increased significantly. The stimulation of tissue with phorbol-12-myristate-13- and ionomycin, recapitulating CAVD microenvironment, resulted in IFN-γ release. Real-time quantitative PCR detected mRNAs for CD8 T-cell activation (Perforin 1, Granzyme B). In stimulated versus unstimulated organoid cultures, elevated IFN-γ reduced the mRNAs encoding for RANKL, TRAP, and Cathepsin K. Molecular imaging showed increased calcium signal intensity in stimulated versus unstimulated parts. CD14 monocytes treated either with recombinant human IFN-γ or with conditioned media-derived IFN-γ exhibited low levels of Cathepsin K, TRAP, RANK, and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 mRNAs, whereas concentrations of the T-cell co-activators CD80 and CD86 increased in parallel with reduced osteoclast resorptive function, effects abrogated by neutralizing anti-IFN-γ antibodies. CD8 cell-derived IFN-γ suppresses osteoclast function and may thus favor calcification in CAVD.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Investigative Pathology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

LCN2 is elevated in multiple human cancers, frequently being associated with tumor size, stage, and invasiveness. Our previous studies have shown that LCN2 expression could be induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) by the binding of five nucleoproteins (MISP, KLF10, KLF15, PPP1R18, and RXR) at a novel TPA-responsive element (TRE), at -152~-60 bp of the 5' flanking region of the  promoter. However, much is unknown about whether these proteins can respond to TPA stimulation to regulate LCN2 transactivation and which cell signaling pathways mediate this process. In this study, expression plasmids encoding these five nucleoproteins were stably transfected into EC109 cells. Then, stable transfectant was characterized by a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System. RT-PCR, real-time PCR, western blotting, specific kinase inhibitor treatment, and bioinformatics analyses were applied in this study. We found that MISP, KLF10, KLF15, PPP1R18, and RXR proteins could strongly respond to TPA stimulation and activate LCN2 transcriptional expression. MEK, ERK, JNK, and P38 kinases were involved in the LCN2 transactivation.

Here, we cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with the intent to collect mBC-derived Abs  and maintain their cell-cell contact-dependent interactions with helper T-cells. PBMCs were cultured with interleukin (IL)-21, CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN), phorbol myristate  (PMA), and phytohemagglutinin/leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) in 24-well flat-bottom plates (5 × 10 cells/well). A culture supernatant analysis of PBMCs from healthy donors ( = 10) indicated that antigen-specific IgM Ab levels in a PBMC culture supernatant might be better able to demonstrate the antigen sensitization status in a smaller peripheral blood sample, compared to IgG because Epstein-Barr virus-specific IgM mBCs circulate peripherally at a significantly higher frequency once antiviral humoral  has stabilized. Thus, our  assay demonstrated the potential significance of antigen-specific IgM Ab production in the culture supernatants. Furthermore, an analysis of cultured PBMCs from allograft kidney recipients ( = 16) sensitized with  donor-specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-specific Abs (DSAs) showed that IgM-type HLA-specific Abs were detected mainly from the culture supernatants from PBMCs of patients with stable graft function, whereas IgG isotype HLA Abs were detectable only from patients with biopsy-proven antibody-mediated rejection. In other words, these IgG isotype Abs also represented an activated humoral immune response . Additionally, IgM- and IgG-expressing mBCs from healthy donors ( = 5) were cultured with IL-21, CpG-ODN, and a supernatant produced by stimulating CD19 B-cell-depleted PBMCs with PHA-L and PMA in 24-well flat-bottom plates (1 × 10 cells/well), and the resulting  analysis provided some information regarding the biological processes of IgG and IgM mBCs in peripheral blood. Taken together, our findings suggest that antigen-specific Ab subtype analyses of supernatants from cultured PBMCs might more effectively and accurately reflect a patient's Ab-associated pathological condition vs. than serum IgG and IgM levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28357321>B cell-helping functions of gut microbial metabolites.</a></h2><p>Commensal microflora profoundly affects the host immune system.

The proportion of cells producing IFN-γ was consistently higher than for cells producing IL-17, with peak levels of ∼25 to 30% of CD3 T cells for the former compared to ∼15% for the latter. Both CD4 T cells and γδ T cells produced IL-17.

The aim of the study was to characterize T-cell populations within tumor tissue and compare them with non-neoplastic liver tissue as well as circulating cells of the same patients.The presence of unique cell populations was investigated in 36 HCC patients by multidimensional flow cytometry followed by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding analysis. Functional activity of tumor-infiltrating T cells was determined after activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13- and ionomycin.Within the tumor there were more cells expressing CD137 and ICOS than in non-neoplastic liver tissue, possibly after recent antigenic activation. These cells contained several populations, including the following: (1) functionally impaired, proliferating CD4 cells co-expressing ICOS and TIGIT; (2) functionally active CD8 cells co-expressing CD38 and PD1; and (3) CD4-CD8 double-negative T-cell receptor αβ and γδ cells (both non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted T cells). When the identified clusters were compared with histologic classification performed on the same samples, an accumulation of activated T cells was observed in immune-inflamed HCC. The same analyses performed in 7 patients receiving nivolumab treatment showed a remarkable reduction in the functionally impaired CD4 cells, which returned to almost normal activity over time.Unique populations of activated T cells are present in HCC tissue, whose antigen specificity remains to be investigated. Some of these cell populations are functionally impaired and nivolumab treatment restores their responsiveness. The finding of ongoing immune response within the tumor shows which lymphocyte populations are impaired within the HCC and identifies the patients who might take benefit from immunotherapy.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

This raises the question whether the increased incidence of allergies, asthma, some autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular disease, and others might relate to intake of unhealthy foods, and the decreased intake of dietary fiber. In recent years, new knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underpinning a 'diet-gut microbiota-physiology axis' has emerged to substantiate this idea. Fiber is fermented to short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly , butyrate, and propionate. These metabolites bind 'metabolite-sensing' G-protein-coupled receptors such as GPR43, GPR41, and GPR109A. These receptors play fundamental roles in the promotion of gut homeostasis and the regulation of inflammatory responses. For instance, these receptors and their metabolites influence Treg biology, epithelial integrity, gut homeostasis, DC biology, and IgA antibody responses. The SCFAs also influence gene transcription in many cells and tissues, through their inhibition of histone deacetylase expression or function. Contained in this mix is the gut microbiome, as commensal bacteria in the gut have the necessary enzymes to digest dietary fiber to SCFAs, and dysbiosis in the gut may affect the production of SCFAs and their distribution to tissues throughout the body. SCFAs can epigenetically modify DNA, and so may be one mechanism to account for diseases with a 'developmental origin', whereby in utero or post-natal exposure to environmental factors (such as nutrition of the mother) may account for disease later in life. If the nutrition-gut microbiome-physiology axis does underpin at least some of the Western lifestyle influence on asthma and allergies, then there is tremendous scope to correct this with healthy foodstuffs, probiotics, and prebiotics.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Moreover, retrospective analysis has suggested that corticosteroid use in humans is associated with an increased risk of keratitis in eyes with pre-existing disease. Thus, while corticosteroids are often used to reduce ocular inflammation in the absence of infection, the risk of opportunistic infection remains a concern. However, the effect of corticosteroids on the intrinsic barrier function of uninfected corneas is unknown. Here, we tested if short-term topical corticosteroid treatment of an uninfected murine cornea would increase susceptibility to P. aeruginosa colonization or infection after epithelial injury. Topical prednisolone  (1%) was administered to one eye of C57BL/6 mice three times a day for 3 days; control eyes were treated with sterile PBS. Prior to inoculation with a cytotoxic P. aeruginosa corneal isolate strain 6206, corneas were subject to superficial-injury by tissue paper blotting, or scratch-injured followed by 12 h of healing. Previously we have shown that blotting renders mouse corneas susceptible to P. aeruginosa adhesion, but not infection, while 12 h healing reduces susceptibility to infection after scratching. Corneas were evaluated at 48 h for bacterial colonization and microbial keratitis (MK). To monitor impact on wound healing, corneal integrity was examined by fluorescein staining immediately after scarification and after 12 h healing. For both the tissue paper blotting and scratch-injury models, there was no significant difference in P. aeruginosa colonization at 48 h between corticosteroid-pretreated eyes and controls. With the blotting model, one case of MK was observed in a control (PBS-pretreated) cornea; none in corticosteroid-pretreated corneas. With the 12 h healing model, MK occurred in 6 of 17 corticosteroid-pretreated eyes versus 2 of 17 controls, a difference not statistically significant. Corticosteroid-pretreated eyes showed greater fluorescein staining 12 h after scarification injury, but this did not coincide with increased colonization or MK. Together, these data show that short-term topical corticosteroid therapy on an uninfected murine cornea does not necessarily enhance its susceptibility to P. aeruginosa colonization or infection after injury, even when it induces fluorescein staining.Copyright © 2018.

We found that the susceptibility of THP-1 CM-treated radioresistant cells to NK cell cytotoxicity was decreased compared to the non-treated cells. In addition, it was found that such a decreased susceptibility was associated with increased programmed death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1) and decreased natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) ligand levels in tumor cells. We further discovered that the THP-1 cells secreted a high level of IL-6, and that blocking IL-6 action by the addition of a neutralizing antibody (Ab) for IL-6 into the THP-1 CM decreased the resistance of THP-1 CM-treated radioresistant cells to NK cell cytotoxicity. Moreover, we discovered that MEK/Erk was the most critical IL-6 downstream signaling pathway in triggering the THP-1 CM effect; thus, the addition of MEK/Erk inhibitor to THP-1 CM enhanced the susceptibility of the THP-1 CM-treated radioresistant cells to NK cell cytotoxicity. On the whole, the findings of this study suggest the existence of a malignant loop characterized by increased macrophage infiltration into radioresistant cells which, in turn, promotes the development of the additional resistance of these cells to NK cell cytotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31010992>The enhancing effect of Acanthopanax sessiliflorus fruit extract on the antibacterial activity of porcine alveolar 3D4/31 macrophages via NF-κB1 and lipid metabolism regulation.</a></h2><p>The demand for measures to improve disease resistance and productivity of livestock are increasing, as most countries prohibit the addition of antibiotics to feed. This study therefore aimed to uncover functional feed additives to help enhance livestock  and disease resistance, using Acanthopanax sessiliflorus fruit extract (ASF).ASF was extracted with 70% EtOH, and total polyphenolic and catechin contents were measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu and vanillin assay, respectively. The 3D4/31 porcine macrophage cells (MΦ) were activated by Phorbol 12-Myristate 13- (PMA), and cell survival and growth rate were measured with or without ASF treatment. Flow-cytometric analysis determined the lysosomal activity, reactive oxygen species levels (ROS), and cell cycle distribution. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) protein expression levels were quantified by western blotting and densitometry analysis. Quantitative PCR was applied to measure the lipid metabolism-related genes expression level. Lastly, the antibacterial activity of 3D4/31 MΦ cells was evaluated by the colony forming unit assay.ASF upregulated the cell viability and growth rate of 3D4/31 MΦ, with or without PMA activation. Moreover, lysosomal activity and intracellular ROS levels were increased after ASF exposure. In addition, the antioxidant enzyme SOD2 expression levels were proportionately increased with ROS levels. Both ASF and PMA treatment resulted in upregulation of NF-κB protein, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α mRNA expression levels, lipid synthesis, and fatty acid oxidation metabolism. Interestingly, co-treatment of ASF with PMA resulted in recovery of NF-κB, TNFα, and lipid metabolism levels. Finally, ASF pretreatment enhanced the in vitro bactericidal activity of 3D4/31 MΦ against Escherichia coli.s: This study provides a novel insight into the regulation of NF-κB activity and lipid metabolism in MΦ, and we anticipate that ASF has the potential to be effective as a feed additive to enhance livestock .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28695849>Full-length nisin  protein NisI from Lactococcus lactis in a lipid-free form: crystallization and X-ray analysis.</a></h2><p>NisI is a lantibiotic-binding lipoprotein that is specific for nisin.

An aggressive proinflammatory immune response is generated in the gastric tissue infected with H. pylori, resulting in gastritis and a series of morphological changes that increase the susceptibility to cancer development. Probiotics could present an alternative solution to prevent or decrease H. pylori infection. Among them, the use of immunomodulatory lactic acid bacteria represents a promising option to reduce the severity of chronic inflammatory-mediated tissue damage and to improve protective  against H. pylori. We previously isolated Lactobacillus fermentum UCO-979C from human gastric tissue and demonstrated its capacity to reduce adhesion of H. pylori to human gastric epithelial cells (AGS cells). In this work, the ability of L. fermentum UCO-979C to modulate immune response in AGS cells and PMA phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA)-differentiated THP-1 (human monocytic leukaemia) macrophages in response to H. pylori infection was evaluated. We demonstrated that the UCO-979C strain is able to differentially modulate the cytokine response of gastric epithelial cells and macrophages after H. pylori infection. Of note, L. fermentum UCO-979C was able to significantly reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in AGS and THP-1 cells as well as increase the levels of immunoregulatory cytokines, indicating a remarkable anti-inflammatory effect. These findings strongly support the probiotic potential of L. fermentum UCO-979C and provide evidence of its beneficial effects against the inflammatory damage induced by H. pylori infection. Although our findings should be proven in appropriate experiments in vivo, in both H. pylori infection animal models and human trials, the results of the present work provide a scientific rationale for the use of L. fermentum UCO-979C to prevent or reduce H. pylori-induced gastric inflammation in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29152242>Comparative assessment of canine-origin  CPN23 and dairy-origin  NCDC 15 for nutrient digestibility, faecal fermentative metabolites and selected gut health indices in dogs.</a></h2><p>The present experiment was undertaken to validate a probiotic of canine origin for its potential use in dogs.

Macrophages are the professional phagocytes that are important in the immune system. In this study, we utilized the macrophages derived from the THP-1 human monocyte cell line as the experimental model to study the functional suppression induced by arsenite (As), one of the most prevalent forms of inorganic arsenic, at environmentally-relevant concentrations. Apoptosis was observed in the THP-1 derived macrophages treated with 500 nM As for 18 h. Suppression of phagocytosis was induced by 18 h As treatment starting from 100 nM. Suppressive effects on the production of two pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and TNF-α, were also found with the treatment of low to moderate doses of As in lipopolysaccharides-stimulated THP-1 derived macrophages. The nitric oxide production was also inhibited by As treatments, which was negatively correlated with the production of superoxide. Collectively, the results from the study demonstrated that environmentally-relevant concentrations of As induced cytotoxicity and suppressed the major cellular functions in THP-1 derived macrophages. The macrophages were showed to be relatively sensitive to As, and could be the essential target of the toxicity induced by environmental arsenic exposures.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) is an important mediator of inflammation in BD. Its expression and effect on neutrophil oxidative burst and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release have not been characterized. In this study, we sought to investigate the role of plasma and the CD40L pathway on NET release and the oxidative burst profile in patients with aBD and iBD.Neutrophils and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from patients with aBD (n = 30), patients with iBD (n = 31), and healthy control subjects (HCs; n = 30). sCD40L plasma concentration was determined in individual samples. A pool of plasma for each group was created. In some experiments, plasma pools were treated with recombinant CD40 (rhCD40-muIg) for sCD40L blockade. NET release and HO/O production were determined after stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-, sCD40L, or plasma pool. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to evaluate the expression of (1) CD40, Mac-1, and phosphorylated NF-κB p65 on neutrophils and monocytes and (2) CD40L on activated T cells and platelets. CD40L gene expression in PBMCs was determined by qRT-PCR.sCD40L plasma levels were significantly higher in patients with iBD (median 17,234, range 2346-19,279 pg/ml) and patients with aBD (median 18,289, range 413-19,883 pg/ml) than in HCs (median 47.5, range 33.7-26.7 pg/ml; p < 0.001). NET release was constitutively increased in BD compared with HC. NET release and HO/O were higher after stimulation with sCD40L or BD plasma and decreased after sCD40L blockade. Mac-1 expression was constitutively increased in neutrophils of patients with aBD (88.7 ± 13.2% of cells) and patients with iBD (89.2 ± 20.1% of cells) compared with HC (27.1 ± 18.8% of cells; p < 0.01). CD40 expression on phagocytes and CD40L expression on platelets were similar in the three groups.

Since fish rely on the innate immune system for health, monitoring the respiratory burst activity may be an effective means of gauging fish health status. Here we report that the respiratory burst of Asian seabass neutrophils can be measured in whole blood by the dihydrorhodamine (DHR)-123 reduction assay and flow cytometry. Neutrophils responded to phorbol myristate  (PMA) in a concentration dependent manner with significant respiratory burst activity at 100-1000 nM. Other known neutrophil agonists, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor, the tripeptide f-met-leu-phe and zymosan, did not induce a significant DHR reduction. Thus, the findings enable us to propose that the DHR-123 flow cytometry whole blood assay, incorporating PMA as a stimulator, would not only facilitate future studies into fish blood neutrophil research but provides a simple, rapid and reliable assay for gauging fish natural  status and health.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Broadly protective immune responses to this single conserved polysaccharide antigen in animals are possible but only when a deacetylated poly--acetyl-d-glucosamine (dPNAG; <30% ) glycoform is administered as a conjugate to a carrier protein. Unfortunately, conventional methods for natural extraction or chemical synthesis of dPNAG and its subsequent conjugation to protein carriers can be technically demanding and expensive. Here, we describe an alternative strategy for creating broadly protective vaccine candidates that involved coordinating recombinant poly--acetyl-d-glucosamine (rPNAG) biosynthesis with outer membrane vesicle (OMV) formation in laboratory strains of  The glycosylated outer membrane vesicles (glycOMVs) released by these engineered bacteria were decorated with the PNAG glycopolymer and induced high titers of PNAG-specific IgG antibodies after immunization in mice. When a  enzyme responsible for PNAG deacetylation was additionally expressed in these cells, glycOMVs were generated that elicited antibodies to both highly acetylated PNAG (∼95-100% ) and a chemically deacetylated dPNAG derivative (∼15% ). These antibodies mediated efficient in vitro killing of two distinct PNAG-positive bacterial species, namely  and  subsp. , and mice immunized with PNAG-containing glycOMVs developed protective  against these unrelated pathogens. Collectively, our results reveal the potential of glycOMVs for targeting this conserved polysaccharide antigen and engendering protective  against the broad range of pathogens that produce surface PNAG.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31152815>Protective effect of a polyphenols-rich extract from Inonotus Sanghuang on bleomycin-induced acute lung injury in mice.</a></h2><p>Mushroom Phellinus linteus ("Sanghuang" in Chinese) is a popular medicinal polypore used to treat several disorders through its various biological functions. Inonotus sanghuang is claimed to produce general immune-potentiating and strengthening, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor and anti-microbial properties, but its effect on acute lung inflammation and oxidative stress are not clearly understood. To determine the effect and mechanism of the polyphenols-rich ethyl  fraction from wild I. sanghuang extract (ISE) on acute lung injury (ALI) induced by bleomycin (BLM), female C57BL/6 mice were fed ISE (0%, 0.15% or 0.6% in diet) for 4 weeks prior to challenge with BLM. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from lung, spleen and lung tissues were collected on day 3 after BLM challenge for histological, oxidative stress, molecular and biochemical analysis. ISE supplementation improved pathological features in lung injury scores and reduced lung wet-to-dry ratios. Moreover, ISE reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and the pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in BALF, decreased the MPO activity and the MDA level and increased the SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activities in lung tissue homogenates. Further mechanism analysis demonstrated that dietary ISE inhibited NF-κB signal. Finally, peripheral immune function analysis showed that ISE had less effect on immune response including splenocyte producing inflammatory cytokines and T cell proliferation except for IL-1β and IL-2. Our findings indicate the possibility that dietary ISE attenuates ALI induced by BLM through correcting the inflammation and oxidation balance at least in part via inhibiting NF-κB signal in vivo, suggesting that ISE might be a valuable medicinal food effective in improving lung injury.Copyright © 2019.

No research information concerning its capability to improve fish immune response is available, so in this study the potential immunomodulatory effects of Protec were investigated in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Head kidney (HK) leukocytes from adult fish (100 g, n = 6) were in vitro incubated with Protec immune support pack resulting in significantly higher respiratory burst activity and proliferation. Specifically, sonicated Protec immune support pack (160 μg/ml) induced a respiratory burst response similar to that promoted by zymosan and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), while non-sonicated Protec immune support pack induced a response comparable to that of cells stimulated with phorbol myristate  (PMA). Moreover, the proliferation of leukocytes exposed to sonicated Protec immune support pack (20 μg/ml) was significantly higher than that of cells stimulated with zymosan, and it was comparable to the proliferation of cells stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and LPS. Afterwards, a feeding trial was performed in a rainbow trout farm. Two groups of juvenile rainbow trout (10 g) were acclimated for 7 weeks before the experiment and fed daily with a commercial control diet (Optiline HE, Skretting Italia) at 2% BW/day. At the end of acclimation, one group of fish was fed with Protec diet (Skretting Italia) at 2% BW/day whereas the other group continued to feed the control diet at the same level for further 4 weeks. Then, fish were sampled (HK leukocytes from n = 6 fish/group, serum from n = 12 fish/group) or intraperitoneally vaccinated against lactococcosis (n = 160/dietary group/time point). Fish fed the same diets for further 4 weeks after vaccination, then feeding returned to the control diet in both groups until the end of the trial. The specific antibody response was recorded at 4 and 8 weeks after vaccination (n = 12 fish/group). The administration of Protec significantly enhanced the respiratory burst activity of leukocytes and the synthesis of specific IgM against Lactococcus garvieae, whereas the serum lysozyme activity was unaffected. The present research suggests that the administration of Protec can improve both innate and adaptive immune response of rainbow trout, proving to be an interesting strategy for enhancing the immune reactivity of fish to vaccines.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The cells were then sorted by flow cytometry to obtain two distinct T-cell populations that did not express the T-cell activation markers, CD69, CD25 and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR: CD69CD25HLA-DR small cells (nonblasts) that had not proliferated in vitro following mitogen stimulation and CD69CD25HLA-DR large cells (which we here call transitional blasts) that had proliferated. The cells were then reactivated with latency-reversing agents and either luciferase or EGFP quantified.Inducible luciferase expression, consistent with latent infection, was observed in nonblasts and transitional blasts following stimulation with either phorbol-myristate-/phytohemagglutinin (3.8 ± 1 and 2.9 ± 0.5 fold above dimethyl sulfoxide, respectively) or romidepsin (2.1 ± 0.6 and 1.8 ± 0.2 fold above dimethyl sulfoxide, respectively). Constitutive expression of luciferase was higher in transitional blasts compared with nonblasts. Using wild-type full-length EGFP reporter virus, inducible virus was observed in nonblasts but not in transitional blasts. No significant difference was observed in the response to latency-reversing agents in either nonblasts or transitional blasts.HIV latency can be established in vitro in resting T cells that have not proliferated (nonblasts) and blasts that have proliferated (transitional blasts).

This technique, however, requires harsh conditions for cell fixation and permeabilization, which can denature surface antigens or antibody-conjugated fluorochromes. These are among several technical limitations which have been a barrier to quantify signaling in unique B cell subsets. One such immature subset, transitional B cells (TrBs), may play a role in suppressing solid organ transplant rejection, graft-versus-host disease, autoimmunity, and even the immune response to malignancy. Here we sought to optimize a protocol for quantification of signaling in human TrBs compared with mature B cell subsets.TrBs were defined by surface marker expression as CD19CD24CD38. Key parameters optimized included antibody clone selection, sequence of surface epitope labeling in relation to paraformaldehyde-based fixation and methanol-based permeabilization, photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltages, and compensation. Special attention was paid to labeling of CD38 with regard to these parameters, and an optimized protocol enabled reliable identification of TrBs, naïve (CD24CD38), early memory (CD24CD38), and late memory (CD24CD38) B cells. Phospho flow cytometry enabled simultaneous quantification of phosphorylation among at least three different signaling molecules within the same sample. Among normal donors, transitional B cells exhibited diminished mitogen activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Akt phospho signaling upon nonspecific stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateand ionomycin stimulation.We optimized an effective protocol to quantify B cell subset signaling upon stimulation. Such a protocol may ultimately serve as the basis for assessing dysfunctional B cell signaling in disease, predict clinical outcomes, and monitor response to B cell-directed therapies.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

FGFBP1 enhances FGF signaling including angiogenesis during cancer progression and is upregulated in various cancers. Here we evaluated the contribution of endogenous FGFBP1 to a wide range of organ functions as well as to skin pathologies using Fgfbp1-knockout mice. Relative to wild-type littermates, knockout mice showed no gross pathologies. Still, in knockout mice a significant thickening of the epidermis associated with a decreased transepidermal water loss and increased proinflammatory gene expression in the skin was detected. Also, skin carcinogen challenge by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene/12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13- resulted in delayed and reduced papillomatosis in knockout mice. This was paralleled by delayed healing of skin wounds and reduced angiogenic sprouting in subcutaneous matrigel plugs. Heterozygous green fluorescent protein (GFP)-knock-in mice revealed rapid induction of gene expression during papilloma induction and during wound healing. Examination of wild-type skin grafted onto Fgfbp1 GFP-knock-in reporter hosts and bone marrow transplants from the GFP-reporter model into wild-type hosts revealed that circulating Fgfbp1-expressing cells migrate into healing wounds.

Therefore, we undertook to investigate changes in the lipid metabolism and survival rate, using 3D4/31 macrophages and Dudleya brittonii which has been used as a traditional asthma treatment.3D4/31 macrophages were used as the in vitro porcine alveolar macrophages model. The cells were activated by exposure to Phorbol 12-Myristate 13- (PMA). D. Brittonii extraction was performed with distilled water. For evaluating the cell survival rate, we performed the water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST) cell viability assay and growth curve analysis. To confirm cell death, cell cycle and intracellular reactive oxygen species levels were measured using flow cytometric analysis by applying fluorescence dye dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) and propidium iodide (PI). Furthermore, we also evaluated cellular lipid accumulation with Oil Red O staining, and fatty acid synthesis related genes expression levels using quantitative PCR (qPCR) with SYBR green dye. Glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle related gene expression levels were measured using qPCR after exposure to Dudleya brittonii extract (DB) for 12 h.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell death were induced by PMA treatment, and exposure to DB reduced the PMA induced downregulation of cell survival. PMA and DB treatments upregulated the lipid accumulation, with corresponding increase in the acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACACA), fatty acid synthase (FASN) mRNA expressions. DB-PMA co-treatment reduced the glycolysis genes expression, but increased the expressions of fatty acid oxidation and TCA cycle genes.This study provides new insights and directions for further researches relating to the  of porcine respiratory system, by employing a model based on alveolar macrophages and natural materials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29111395>Time-response characteristic and potential biomarker identification of heavy metal induced toxicity in zebrafish.</a></h2><p>The present work aims to explore the time-response (from 24 h to 96 h) characteristic and identify early potential sensitive biomarkers of copper (Cu) (as copper chloride dihydrate), cadmium (Cd) (as cadmium ), lead (Pb) (as lead nitrate) and chromium (Cr) (as potassium dichromate) exposure in adult zebrafish, focusing on reactive oxygen species (ROS), SOD activity, lipid peroxidation and gene expression related to oxidative stress and inflammatory response. Furthermore, the survival rate decreased apparently by a concentration-dependent manner after Cu, Cr, Cd and Pb exposure, and we selected non-lethal concentrations 0.05 mg/L for Cu, 15 mg/L for Cr, 3 mg/L for Cd and 93.75μg/L for Pb to test the effect on the following biological indicators. Under non-lethal concentration, the four heavy metals have no apparent histological change in adult zebrafish gills. Similar trends in ROS production, MDA level and SOD activity were up-regulated by the four heavy metals, while MDA level responded more sensitive to Pb by time-dependent manner than the other three heavy metals. In addition, mRNA levels related to antioxidant system (SOD1, SOD2 and Nrf2) were up-regulated by non-lethal concentration Cu, Cr, Cd and Pb exposure. MDA level and SOD1 gene have a more delayed response to heavy metals. Genes related to immunotoxicity were increased significantly after heavy metals exposure at non-lethal concentrations. TNF-α and IL-1β gene have similar sensibility to the four heavy metals, while IL-8 gene was more responsive to Cr, Cd and Pb exposure at 48 h groups and IFN-γ gene showed more sensitivity to Cu at 48 h groups than the other heavy metals. In conclusion, the present works have suggested that the IFN-γ gene may applied as early sensitive biomarker to identify Cu-induced toxicity, while MDA content and IL-8 gene may use as early sensitive biomarkers for evaluating the risk of Pb exposure. Moreover, IL-8 and IFN-γ gene were more responsive to heavy metals, which may become early sensitive and potential biomarkers for evaluating inflammatory response induced by heavy metals. This work reinforces the concept of the usefulness of gene expression assays in the evaluation of chemicals effects and helps to establish a background data as well as contributes to evaluate early environmental risk for chemicals, even predicting toxicity.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The role of angiotensin II and the signaling of type 1 angiotensin II receptor (AGT1R) in T-lymphocyte activation and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production are largely unknown.Jurkat T-cells were treated with AGT1R inhibitor candesartan and stimulated with phorbol myristate  (PMA) and ionomycin. T-Cell activation, associated cytokine production and levels of signaling proteins were evaluated by flow cytometry and western blot analysis.Candesartan significantly suppressed PMA and ionomycin-induced CD25 expression and IL-2 production. Regarding the molecular mechanism involved, we showed that such suppressive effects of blocking of AGT1R by candesartan resulted in the significant inhibition of ERK activation in PMA-stimulated Jurkat T-cells. The effect of ERK inhibition on T-cell activation was further confirmed. Treatment with FR180204, a specific ERK inhibitor, reduced T-cell activation and IL-2 secretion.AGT1R signaling is essential for T-cell activation and IL-2 production, and the inhibition of this pathway suppressed T-cell activation via an ERK-dependent mechanism.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Recently, evidence has demonstrated that interactions among the microbiota, female sex hormones, and  are associated with the development of autoimmune diseases. However, no studies have investigated if therapeutic gut microbiota modulation strategies could affect asthma exacerbation during menstruation and menopause. Here we aimed to examine the preventive effects of a probiotic,  5, on airway inflammation exacerbation in allergic ovariectomized mice. We first evaluated the gut microbiota composition and diversity in mice 10 days after ovariectomy. Next, we examined whether re-exposure of ovariectomized allergic mice to antigen (ovalbumin) would lead to exacerbation of lung inflammation. Finally, we evaluated the preventive and treatment effect of  5 on lung inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. Our results showed that whereas ovariectomy caused no alterations in the gut microbiota composition and diversity in this animal model, 10 days after ovariectomy, preventive use administration of  5, rather than its use after surgery was capable of attenuate the exacerbated lung inflammation and hyperresponsiveness in ovariectomized allergic mice. This prophylactic effect of  5 involves  production, which led to increased fecal  levels and, consequently, increased Treg cells in ovariectomized allergic mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30402874>Charged molecular silica trigger in vitro NETosis in human granulocytes via both oxidative and autophagic pathways.</a></h2><p>Neutrophils play a key role in  and are known to respond to exogenous threats by releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) through NETosis, a process involving the release of neutrophils nuclear DNA decorated with proteins into the extracellular space. In this study, attention has been focused on the ability of differently charged molecular systems polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) to induce NETosis.NETs formation was induced by phorbol myristate  (PMA) (positive control) and POSS treatment and visualized by confocal microscopy. Moreover, NETs production was quantified by Sytox green staining. Oxidative stress, autophagy as well as endocytosis involvement in the observed phenomena was evaluated by a specific inhibitory approach.Results obtained in this study demonstrate a POSS time and dose-dependent ability in inducing NETs release irrespectively to their charge. POSS induced NETosis is a consequence of their internalization, as demonstrated by the strong reduction in NETs formation after endocytosis inhibition. Moreover, POSS induced NETosis involves both an increase in superoxide anion generation and autophagy pathway activation as demonstrated by the protective effect displayed by sodium azide and wortmannin.Data presented in this study indicate that nanomaterials and molecular systems could have a role in the onset of inflammatory phenomena.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30866760>Metabolic intermediate acetyl phosphate modulates bacterial virulence via acetylation.</a></h2><p>Accumulating evidence indicates that bacterial metabolism plays an important role in virulence. Acetyl phosphate (AcP), the high-energy intermediate of the phosphotransacetylase- kinase pathway, is the major acetyl donor in E. coli. PhoP is an essential transcription factor for bacterial virulence. Here, we show in Salmonella typhimurium that PhoP is non-enzymatically acetylated by AcP, which modifies its transcriptional activity, demonstrating that the acetylation of Lysine 102 (K102) is dependent on the intracellular AcP. The acetylation level of K102 decreases under PhoP-activating conditions including low magnesium, acid stress or following phagocytosis. Notably, in vitro assays show that K102 acetylation affects PhoP phosphorylation and inhibits its transcriptional activity. Both cell and mouse models show that K102 is critical to Salmonella virulence, and suggest acetylation is involved in regulating PhoP activity. Together, the current study highlights the importance of the metabolism in bacterial virulence, and shows AcP might be a key mediator.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30291510>Extended mutualism between termites and gut microbes: nutritional symbionts contribute to nest hygiene.</a></h2><p>All higher eukaryotes have established symbiotic relationships with diverse microorganisms. One of the most well-characterized symbiotic systems is that of termites and their intestinal microorganisms, which digest cellulose. Recently, diverse types of symbioses between gut microbes and host organisms including humans have received growing attention for various features of their complex interactions beyond nutrition. In termites, researchers are beginning to explore such function of gut symbionts, but only the contribution to internal  against entomopathogen is known in a few species. Here, we report that gut symbionts of the dampwood termite Zootermopsis nevadensis protect nests from the spread of the commensal bacterium Serratia marcescens, which has pathogenic potential. Defaunated termites dispersed S. marcescens in the surrounding environment by feeding on the bacteria, which then survived passage through their alimentary tracts, while non-defaunated termites did not. Loss of gut symbionts caused a significant reduction in intestinal , which is an important carbon source for termites. Culture experiments showed that  had significant inhibitory effects on S. marcescens at a concentration as low as 12 mM, which indicated that the intestinal  of non-defaunated termites (40-130 mM) was capable of suppressing this bacterium. These results suggest that digestive derivatives produced by intestinal symbionts play an essential role in nest hygiene in addition to their nutritional function for termites. Our study provides a better understanding of the multifunctionality of symbiotic relationships in diverse organisms beyond nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28715929>Molecular interactions of bisphenols and analogs with glucocorticoid biosynthetic pathway enzymes: an in silico approach.</a></h2><p>Glucocorticoids are known to have vital effects on metabolism, behavior and . Any sort of impairment in their synthesis may lead to the generation of numerous ill health effects. Different environmental toxicants, including bisphenols and their analogs pose deleterious effect on the biosynthesis of glucocorticoids, thereby leading to endocrine disruption. In order to assess the effect of these environmental toxicants on gluocorticoid biosynthetic pathway, an in silico study was performed. This involved molecular docking studies of 18 ligands with the selected participating enzymes of the pathway. These enzymes were CYP11A1, CYP11B2, CYP19A1, CYP17A1, 3α/20β-HSD, 3β/17β-HSD and CYP21A2. Comparison of their binding affinity was made with the known inhibitors of these enzymes. In case of CYP11A1, Bisphenol M (BP M) had the lowest docking score (D score) of -8.699 kCal/mol, and was better than that of the standard, Metyrapone. Bisphenol PH (BP PH) was found to have significant affinity with CYP11B2. In case CYP19A1, results were found to be comparable with the standards, Exemestane and Letrozole. BP PH elicited better results than the standard Abiraterone  against CYP17A1. BP M had a D score of -7.759 against 3α/20β-HSD, again better results than the standard, Trilostane. Upon molecular docking of BP PH against CYP21A2, it was seen that amongst all the analogs, it had maximum interactions along with the lowest D score. From all the above instances mentioned, it is quite evident that certain BPA analogs have more potential to modulate the enzymes involved in comparison to the known inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29984733>Proteomic Analysis Reveals the Renoprotective Effect of Tribulus terrestris against Obesity-Related Glomerulopathy in Rats.</a></h2><p>Tribulus terrestris L. (Zygophyllaceae) (TT) is usually used as a cardiotonic, diuretic, and aphrodisiac, as well as for herbal post-stroke rehabilitation in traditional Chinese medicine. However, little is known about the renoprotective effects of TT on obesity-related glomerulopathy (ORG). In this study, 340 monomeric compounds were identified from TT extracts obtained with ethyl  combined with 50% methanol. In vitro, IC of TT was 912.01 mg/L, and the appropriate concentration of TT against oxidized-low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) induced human renal glomerular endothelial cells (HRGECs) was 4 mg/L. TT significantly increased the viability (63.2%) and migration (2.33-fold increase) of HRGECs. ORG model rats were induced by a chronic high-fat diet (45%) for 20 weeks and were then treated with TT extract (2.8 g/kg/d) for 8 weeks. Subsequently, the kidneys were removed and their differentially expressed protein profile was identified using two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF)-TOF MS. Molecular categorization and functional analysis of bioinformatic annotation suggested that excessive energy metabolism, decreased response to stress and low  were the potential etiologies of ORG. After TT administration for 8 weeks, body weight, blood pressure, serum cystatin C and cholesterol were decreased. Additionally, TT significantly enhanced the resistance of rats to ORG, decreased energy consumption and the hemorrhagic tendency, and improved the response to acute phase reactants and . In conclusion, TT may play a protective role against ORG in rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30978399>Minimal uranium immunotoxicity following a 60-day drinking water exposure to uranyl  in male and female C57BL/6J mice.</a></h2><p>Historical uranium (U) mining in the Southwestern United States resulted in significant environmental contamination throughout this region and presents a significant risk of chronic metal exposure and toxicity for communities living in close proximity to mine waste sites. Uranium exposure is associated with numerous deleterious health effects including immune dysfunction; however, its effects on the immune system have yet to be fully characterized. We recently published that drinking water exposure to U, in the form of uranyl  (UA), results in low overall tissue retention of U (<0.01%), with very little accumulation in immune organs (blood, bone marrow, spleen, and thymus) of male and female mice. In the present study we characterized the immunotoxicity of U, in the form of UA, following a 60-day drinking water exposure to 5 and 50 ppm in male and female C57BL/6J mice. The following immunotoxicity endpoints were evaluated: hematology, immune tissue weights and total cell recoveries, immunophenotying of the spleen and thymus, and immune cell function (lymphocyte mitogenesis and T-dependent antibody response). Uranium exposure had subtle impacts on the immune endpoints evaluated, likely due to low U accumulation at these sites. The only significant alterations were a slight decrease in the percentages of splenic natural killer T-cells and macrophages in exposed male mice. Despite minimal immunological effects, this study highlights the importance of investigating toxicological endpoints in both sexes and developing accurate animal models that model epidemiological exposures in the future.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, innovative approaches based on the oral administration of SCFAs have been discussed for therapeutic modification of inflammatory immune responses in autoimmune diseases. So far, most studies have investigated the SCFA-mediated effects on CD4 T cells and antigen presenting cells. Here we show that butyrate and, to a lesser degree, propionate directly modulate the gene expression of CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and Tc17 cells. Increased IFN-γ and granzyme B expression by CTLs as well as the molecular switch of Tc17 cells towards the CTL phenotype was mediated by butyrate independently of its interaction with specific SCFA-receptors GPR41 and GPR43. Our results indicate that butyrate strongly inhibited histone-deacetylases (HDACs) in CD8 T cells thereby affecting the gene expression of effector molecules. Accordingly, the pan-HDAC inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA) and sodium valproate exerted similar influence on CD8 T cells. Furthermore, higher  concentrations were also able to increase IFN-γ production in CD8 T lymphocytes by modulating cellular metabolism and mTOR activity. These findings might have significant implications in adoptive immunotherapy of cancers and in anti-viral .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29698514>Medroxyprogesterone , unlike norethisterone, increases HIV-1 replication in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and an indicator cell line, via mechanisms involving the glucocorticoid receptor, increased CD4/CD8 ratios and CCR5 levels.</a></h2><p>High usage of progestin-only injectable contraceptives, which include the intramuscular injectables depo-medroxyprogesterone  (DMPA-IM, Depo-Provera) and norethisterone (NET) enanthate (NET-EN or Nur-Isterate), correlates worldwide with areas of high HIV-1 prevalence. Epidemiological data show a significant association between usage of DMPA-IM and increased HIV-1 acquisition but no such association from limited data for NET-EN. Whether MPA and NET have similar effects on HIV-1 acquisition and pathogenesis, and the relationship between these effects and the dose of MPA, are critical issues for women's health and access to suitable and safe contraceptives. We show for the first time that MPA, unlike NET, significantly increases HIV-1 replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and a cervical cell line model. The results provide novel evidence for a biological mechanism whereby MPA, acting via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), increases HIV-1 replication by at least in part increasing expression of the CCR5 HIV-1 coreceptor on target T-lymphocytes. MPA, unlike NET, also increases activation of T-cells and increases the CD4/CD8 ratio, suggesting that multiple mechanisms are involved in the MPA response. Our data offer strong support for different biological mechanisms for MPA versus NET, due to their differential GR activity. The dose-dependence of the MPA response suggests that significant effects are observed within the range of peak serum levels of progestins in DMPA-IM but not NET-EN users. Dose-response results further suggest that effects of contraceptives containing MPA on HIV-1 acquisition and disease progression may be critically dependent on dose, time after injection and intrinsic factors that affect serum concentrations in women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31212848>Polyphenol Effects on Splenic Cytokine Response in Post-Weaning Contactin 1-Overexpressing Transgenic Mice.</a></h2><p>In mice, postnatal immune development has previously been investigated, and evidence of a delayed maturation of the adaptive immune response has been detected.In this study, the effects of red grape polyphenol oral administration on the murine immune response were explored using pregnant mice (TAG/F3 transgenic and wild type (wt) mice) as the animal model. The study was performed during pregnancy as well as during lactation until postnatal day 8. Suckling pups from polyphenol-administered dams as well as day 30 post-weaning pups (dietary-administered with polyphenols) were used. Polyphenol effects were evaluated, measuring splenic cytokine secretion.Phorbol myristate -activated splenocytes underwent the highest cytokine production at day 30 in both wt and TAG/F3 mice. In the latter, release of interferon (IFN)-γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α was found to be higher than in the wt counterpart. In this context, polyphenols exerted modulating activities on day 30 TAG/F3 mice, inducing release of interleukin (IL)-10 in hetero mice while abrogating release of IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-4 in homo and hetero mice.Polyphenols are able to prevent the development of an inflammatory/allergic profile in postnatal TAG/F3 mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29111180>Effects of kestose on gut mucosal  in an atopic dermatitis mouse model.</a></h2><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is recently increasing among populations, but the underlying mechanisms remain controversial. Interactions between the gut microbiota and mucosal  are considered to be a crucial etiology. Fructooligosaccharide (FOS), prebiotics have been reported as activators of the gut microbiota.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of kestose, the smallest FOS and FOS on atopic dermatitis in mice.An AD mouse model was developed by (ovalbumin) epidermal sensitization using BALB/c mice. Kestose (1%, 5%, and 10%) or FOS (5%, positive control) was orally administered throughout the study.In comparison with the values observed for the control AD mice, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), clinical score, and skin inflammation on histopathology were significantly decreased by the oral administration of kestose. Total IgE, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in skin, and IL-4 were also suppressed by this administration. In addition, the population of CD4Foxp3 cells in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and  concentrations in feces were significantly increased by kestose treatment.These findings suggest that kestose activates the gut immune system to induce the tolerance against allergic skin inflammations in AD.Copyright © 2017 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

Its expression in immune-related cells enhances the antimicrobial effect and inhibits HIV replication in macrophages. However, the role of IL-16 in macrophage polarization is uncertain. Mir-145 was reported to regulate IL-10 expression by targeting histone deacetylase 11 and promotes alternatively activated macrophage (M2) polarization. Mir-145 was also predicted to target IL-16 mRNA. We aimed to explore the roles of IL-16 and mir-145 in macrophage polarization and antimicrobial functions.THP1 monocytes were employed in this study, and their cell activity when incubated with different concentrations of IL-16 was evaluated using the CCK-8 cell counting kit. To obtain polarized macrophages, THP-1 cells were induced by IL-4 and IL-13 following PMA incubation (M2 polarized macrophages) or induced by IFN-gamma and LPS (M1 classical macrophage activation). The influence of IL-16 on macrophage phagocytosis was quantified by the amount of chicken red blood cell phagocytized. IL-16, IL-10 and miR-145 expression in THP1 monocytes and induced macrophages was quantified by quantitative PCR. The miR-145 and IL-16 targeting relationship was verified by the dual luciferase reporter assay. The influence of IL-16 and mir-145 on macrophage polarization was evaluated by M1 and M2 macrophage characterized marker gene expression.The M0 macrophage subtype was induced by PMA. The M1 and M2 subtypes of macrophage were successfully induced by M1- and M2-specific induction. M1 macrophages express higher levels of IL-16 than M2 macrophages but express lower levels of IL-10 and mir-145 than M2 cells. IL-16 with a concentration up to 150 ng/mL has no influence on THP-1 cell proliferation but improves macrophage phagocytosis ability with the down-expression of IL-10 and up-expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1a and IL-6. Knockdown with its target siRNA is beneficial for macrophage maintenance but reduces phagocytosis ability. Mir-145 specifically targets the IL-16 3'UTR verified by the dual luciferase reporter assay. Mir-145 downregulates IL-16 expression and upregulates IL-10 expression, thereby promoting M2 macrophage polarization.IL-16 modulates macrophage polarization through regulating IL-10, IL-1a and IL-6 expression.

It was recently shown that salt enhances IL-17A production from CD4+ T cells via a serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1-dependent (SGK1-dependent) pathway. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that SGK1 signaling in T cells promotes hypertension and contributes to end-organ damage. We show that loss of T cell SGK1 results in a blunted hypertensive response to Ang II infusion by 25 mmHg. Importantly, renal and vascular inflammation is abrogated in these mice compared with control mice. Furthermore, mice lacking T cell SGK1 are protected from Ang II-induced endothelial dysfunction and renal injury. Loss of T cell SGK1 also blunts blood pressure and vascular inflammation in response to deoxycorticosterone -salt (DOCA-salt) hypertension. Finally, we demonstrate that the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) is upregulated in Th17 cells and is necessary for the salt-induced increase in SGK1 and the IL-23 receptor. These studies demonstrate that T cell SGK1 and NKCC1 may be novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of hypertension and identify a potentially new mechanism by which salt contributes to hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29887373>A Metabolite-Triggered Tuft Cell-ILC2 Circuit Drives Small Intestinal Remodeling.</a></h2><p>The small intestinal tuft cell-ILC2 circuit mediates epithelial responses to intestinal helminths and protists by tuft cell chemosensory-like sensing and IL-25-mediated activation of lamina propria ILC2s. Small intestine ILC2s constitutively express the IL-25 receptor, which is negatively regulated by A20 (Tnfaip3).

Upon stimulation, they are able to decondense and release their chromatin as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). This process (NETosis) is part of immune defense mechanisms but also plays an important role in many chronic and inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and cancer. For this reason, much effort has been invested into understanding biochemical signaling pathways in NETosis. However, the impact of the mechanical micro-environment and adhesion on NETosis is not well-understood. Here, we studied how adhesion and especially substrate elasticity affect NETosis. We employed polyacrylamide (PAA) gels with distinctly defined elasticities (Young's modulus  within the physiologically relevant range from 1 to 128 kPa and coated the gels with integrin ligands (collagen I, fibrinogen). Neutrophils were cultured on these substrates and stimulated with potent inducers of NETosis: phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Interestingly, PMA-induced NETosis was neither affected by substrate elasticity nor by different integrin ligands. In contrast, for LPS stimulation, NETosis rates increased with increasing substrate elasticity ( > 20 kPa). LPS-induced NETosis increased with increasing cell contact area, while PMA-induced NETosis did not require adhesion at all. Furthermore, inhibition of phosphatidylinositide 3 kinase (PI3K), which is involved in adhesion signaling, completely abolished LPS-induced NETosis but only slightly decreased PMA-induced NETosis. In summary, we show that LPS-induced NETosis depends on adhesion and substrate elasticity while PMA-induced NETosis is completely independent of adhesion.Copyright © 2019 Erpenbeck, Gruhn, Kudryasheva, Günay, Meyer, Busse, Neubert, Schön, Rehfeldt and Kruss.</p></html>
