Apolipoprotein B lipoproteins (apoB lipoproteins) induce white adipose tissue (WAT) dysfunction, which in turn promotes postprandial hypertriglyceridemia,  (IR), and hyperinsulinemia.The aim of this study was to explore whether high plasma apoB, or number of plasma apoB lipoproteins, identifies subjects who best ameliorate WAT dysfunction and related risk factors after a hypocaloric diet.Fifty-nine men and postmenopausal women [mean ± SD age: 58 ± 6 y; body mass index (kg/): 32.6 ± 4.6] completed a prospective study with a 6-mo hypocaloric diet (-500 kcal/d). Glucose-induced  secretion (GIIS) and  sensitivity (IS) were measured by 1-h intravenous glucose-tolerance test (IVGTT) followed by a 3-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, respectively. Ex vivo gynoid WAT function (i.e., hydrolysis and storage of 3H-triolein-labeled triglyceride-rich lipoproteins) and 6-h postprandial plasma clearance of a 13C-triolein-labeled high-fat meal were measured in a subsample (n = 25).Postintervention first-phase GIISIVGTT and total C-peptide secretion decreased in both sexes, whereas second-phase and total GIISIVGTT and clamp IS were ameliorated in men (P < 0.05). Baseline plasma apoB was associated with a postintervention increase in WAT function (r = 0.61) and IS (glucose infusion rate divided by steady state  (M/Iclamp) r = 0.30) and a decrease in first-phase, second-phase, and total GIISIVGTT (r = -0.30 to -0.35) without sex differences. The association with postintervention amelioration in WAT function and GIISIVGTT was independent of plasma cholesterol (total, LDL, and HDL), sex, and changes in body composition. Subjects with high baseline plasma apoB (1.2 ± 0.2 g/L) showed a significant increase in WAT function (+105%; P = 0.012) and a decrease in total GIISIVGTT (-34%; P ≤ 0.001), whereas sex-matched subjects with low plasma apoB (0.7 ± 0.1 g/L) did not, despite equivalent changes in body composition and energy intake and expenditure.High plasma apoB identifies obese subjects who best ameliorate WAT dysfunction and glucose-induced hyperinsulinemia, independent of changes in adiposity after consumption of a hypocaloric diet. We propose that subjects with high plasma apoB represent an optimal target group for the primary prevention of T2D by hypocaloric diets.

We sought to evaluate overweight as the additional risk factor that can increase the prediction of colorectal neoplasia (CRN) detection in Thais apart from the Asia-Pacific Colorectal Screening (APCS) score.We prospectively enrolled asymptomatic 338 subjects who underwent screening colonoscopy between November 2016 and September 2017. All risk factors according to APCS, BMI and the presence of metabolic syndrome were collected. Overweight was defined as BMI ≥23 kg/. By APCS score, subjects were categorized into 1) high-risk and 2) average-risk. Using the combination of APCS score and overweight, subjects were stratified into 4 groups; high-risk with overweight (G1), average-risk with overweight (G2), high-risk with normal weight (G3) average-risk and with normal weight (G4). Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the risk of detecting CRN.The prevalence of CRN in the high-risk subjects was higher than that of in the average-risk subjects (49%vs.32%; OR, 2.00; 95%CI, 1.17-3.41). After adjustment for APCS risk factors and metabolic syndrome, overweight significantly increased the risk of detecting CRN (OR, 2.52; 95%CI, 1.57-4.05). Among the 4 groups, the detection rates of CRN were significantly different (G1=64%, G2=40%, G3=32% and G4=21%, p<0.01). The relative risk of detecting CRN increased when G1 (OR 6.49; 95%CI, 2.87-14.67), and G2 (2.42; 1.39-4.21) were compared with G4.In addition to the APCS score, overweight is an independent risk factor for detecting CRN. In Thai population, combining overweight and APCS score may be useful to improve the prediction for CRN.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914267>Macrophage p38α promotes nutritional steatohepatitis through M1 polarization.</a></h2><p>p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases are important inflammatory factors. p38α alteration has been implicated in both human and mouse inflammatory disease models. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the cell type-specific role of p38α in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).Human liver tissues were obtained from 27 patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and 20 control individuals. NASH was established and compared between hepatocyte-specific p38α knockout (p38α), macrophage-specific p38α knockout (p38α) and wild-type (p38α) mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD), high-fat/high-cholesterol diet (HFHC), or methionine-and choline-deficient diet (MCD). p38 inhibitors were administered to HFHC-fed wild-type mice for disease treatment.p38α was significantly upregulated in the liver tissues of patients with NAFLD. Compared to p38α littermates, p38α mice developed significant nutritional steatohepatitis induced by HFD, HFHC or MCD. Meanwhile, p38α mice exhibited less severe steatohepatitis and  than p38α mice in response to a HFHC or MCD. The effect of macrophage p38α in promoting steatohepatitis was mediated by the induction of pro-inflammatory factors (CXCL2, IL-1β, CXCL10 and IL-6) secreted by M1 macrophages and associated signaling pathways. p38α mice exhibited  anti-inflammatory polarization as demonstrated by increased CD45F4/80CD11bCD206  macrophages and enhanced arginase activity in liver tissues. Primary hepatocytes from p38α mice showed decreased steatosis and inflammatory damage. In a co-culture system, p38α deleted macrophages attenuated steatohepatitic changes in hepatocytes through decreased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, CXCL10 and IL-6), which mediate M1 macrophage polarization in p38α mice. Restoration of TNF-α, CXCL10 or IL-6 induced lipid accumulation and inflammatory responses in p38α hepatocytes co-cultured with p38α macrophages. Moreover, pharmacological p38 inhibitors suppressed HFHC-induced steatohepatitis.Macrophage p38α promotes the progression of steatohepatitis by inducing pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and M1 polarization. p38 inhibition protects against steatohepatitis. LAY SUMMARY: p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases are important inflammatory factors. In the present study, we demonstrated that p38α is upregulated in liver tissues of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases. Genetic deletion of p38α in macrophages led to ameliorated nutritional steatohepatitis in mice through decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and increased  macrophage polarization.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

The SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) has been identified as an important player in inflammatory diseases involving macrophages. However, the role of SHP-1 in modulating the macrophage phenotype has not been elucidated yet. In the present work, we show that adipose tissue macrophage (ATM)-specific deletion of SHP-1 using glucan particle-loaded siRNA improves the metabolic phenotype in dietary obese -resistant mice. The molecular mechanism involves AT remodeling via reducing crown-like structure formation and balancing the pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory macrophage () population. Therefore, targeting ATM-specific SHP-1 using glucan-particle-loaded SHP-1 antagonists could be of immense therapeutic use for the treatment of obesity-associated .Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Peripheral quantitative computed tomography assessed mid-calf muscle density (66% tibial length) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry determined visceral fat area. Fasting glucose, Homeostatic Model Assessment of  (HOMA-IR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were analysed. Physical function assessments included hand grip and knee extension strength, balance path length (computerised posturography), stair climb test, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and self-reported falls efficacy (Modified Falls Efficacy Scale; M-FES).Visceral fat area, not muscle density, was independently associated with CRP and fasting glucose (B=0.025; 95% CI 0.009-0.042 and B=0.009; 0.001-0.017, respectively). Nevertheless, higher muscle density was independently associated with lower path length and stair climb time, and higher SPPB and M-FES scores (all P⟨0.05). Visceral fat area, fasting glucose and CRP did not mediate these associations.Higher calf muscle density predicts better physical function in overweight and obese older adults independent of , visceral adiposity or inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30071525>Impact of 2 Different Hypocaloric Diets on Serum Omentin Levels in Obese Subjects.</a></h2><p>Omentin-1 might play a role in  and obesity. This study is aimed at evaluating the influence of weight loss treatment on omentin-1 concentrations and other parameters after 2 different hypocaloric diets in obese subjects.A total of 239 obese subjects were randomly allocated during 12 weeks (Diet I - high-fat diet vs. Diet II - low fat diet), and their anthropometric and biochemical status were evaluated.After dietary intervention, BMI, weight, fat mass, waist circumference, systolic blood, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol,  levels and homeostasis model assessment for  decreased in a statistical manner from their base values. After consuming diet II (low fat diet), the omentin-1 levels increased in males (20 ± 14 ng/mL) and females (35 ± 19 ng/mL). No changes were observed in omentin-1 levels after consuming hypocaloric diet type I (high fat). The multiple regression analyses after weight loss with diet I adjusted by age and sex showed a statistical association between BMI kg/ (Beta -0.33: 95% CI -4.58 to -0.11) and post-treatment omentin-1 levels. The analysis after weight loss with diet II showed a statistical association with BMI kg/ (Beta -0.31: 95% CI -3.93 to -0.08) and  UI/L (Beta -0.25: 95% CI -4.63 to -0.05) with post-treatment omentin-1 levels.Our design showed a significant increase in serum omentin-1 levels after weight loss secondary to a low fat hypocaloric diet, in contrast to no changes following consuming a high fat hypocaloric diet.© 2018 S.

Despite the growing body of evidences, several studies were conducted in older individuals or in carriers of diseases susceptible to affect SUA levels and cardiometabolic risk markers.To evaluate the relationship of SUA with body adiposity, metabolic profile, oxidative stress, inflammatory biomarkers, blood pressure and endothelial function in healthy young and middle-aged adults.149 Brazilian adults aged 20-55 years, both sexes, underwent evaluation of body adiposity, SUA, fasting glucose and , lipid profile, malondialdehyde (MDA), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), adiponectin, blood pressure and endothelial function. Endothelial function was assessed by the reactive hyperemia index (RHI) derived from peripheral arterial tonometry method. Participants were allocated in two groups according to SUA levels: control group (CG; n = 130; men ≤ 7 mg/dL, women ≤ 6 mg/dL) and hyperuricemia group (HG; n = 19; men > 7 mg/dL, women > 6 mg/dL). A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.After adjustment for confounders, participants in HG compared with those in CG displayed higher body mass index (BMI): 34.15(33.36-37.19) vs.31.80 (26.26-34.42) kg/,p = 0.008, higher MDA: 4.67(4.03-5.30) vs. 3.53(3.10-4.07) ng/mL, p < 0.0001 and lower RHI: 1.68 ± 0.30 vs. 2.05 ± 0.46, p = 0.03). In correlation analysis adjusted for confounders, SUA was positively associated (p < 0.05) with BMI, waist circumference, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and MDA, and negatively associated (p < 0.05) with HDL-cholesterol, adiponectin and RHI.This study suggests that in healthy young and middle-aged adults higher SUA levels are associated with higher body adiposity, unfavorable lipid and inflammatory phenotype, higher oxidative stress and impaired endothelial function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30955400>The Effect of Soybean Lunasin on Cardiometabolic Risk Factors: A Randomized Clinical Trial.</a></h2><p>Lunasin, a peptide isolated from soybeans, has been shown to exert antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, and hypocholesterolemic effects in animal and in vitro models.

Previous studies have implicated PAI-1 in adipose tissue (AT) expansion, while also contributing to . As inflammation is also known to occur in perirenal AT during obesity, we hypothesized that in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model, PAI-1 contributes to macrophage-mediated inflammation and diabetic nephropathy. The HFD mice showed increased expression of PAI-1 in perirenal fat and also displayed increased fat weight and macrophage numbers. We found that the macrophage polarization, proinflammatory macrophage-M1-phenotype, including CD11c, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, were increased by an HFD and decreased by either the genetic depletion of PAI-1 or treatment with the PAI-1 inhibitor, PAI-039. Similarly, an enhanced anti-inflammatory -phenotype, including CD206 and IL-10, was accompanied by either the genetic deletion of PAI-1 or PAI-039 treatment. Furthermore, the inhibition of PAI-1 reduced HFD-induced renal histological lesions and abated profibrotic/extracellular-matrix protein. Collectively, our findings provide support that PAI-1 contributes to the development of inflammation in perirenal fat and correlates with the development of diabetic nephropathy in HFD-induced obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30137362>Vitamin D and Tissue-Specific  Sensitivity in Humans With Overweight/Obesity.</a></h2><p>Vitamin D deficiency in obesity has been linked to .

This paper explores alternative ways to assess the potential disease impact of the epidemic, which is currently based almost exclusively on body mass index (BMI) data. It also argues in favor of concerted efforts to modify the built ecosystem that is driving the obesity epidemic. Most of the epidemiologic data on obesity are based on BMI (in kg/) and use the ranges of 18.5-24.9 for normality, 25-29.9 for overweight, and ≥30 for obesity. But the gap between the median of the "normal" BMI distribution (∼22) and the current population BMI of, for example, the United States (27.7) has become so wide that it is unlikely that we will be able to close that gap in the near future. Furthermore, the correlation between BMI and disease risk is not linear. Over 60% of the global disease burden of obesity affects individuals with a BMI ≥30, who comprise only ∼10% of the global population of overweight/obese persons. Furthermore, BMI accounts for only ∼17% of the risk of  and subsequent type 2 diabetes in the BMI ≥25 population. Epigenetics, specifically DNA methylation, appears to play a far more important role than BMI in determining the risk of obesity's comorbidities, such as diabetes. Similarly, socioeconomic status carries a higher risk than BMI level for the development of obesity-related noncommunicable diseases. Finally, the built environment that sustains our species' lifestyle is a major driver of the obesity epidemic. Modifying that ecosystem will require no less than a social movement, one able to promote and sustain the necessary coordinated action of virtually all sectors of society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30067966>Loss of Nucleobindin-2 Causes  in Obesity without Impacting Satiety or Adiposity.</a></h2><p>Inducers of satiety are drug targets for weight loss to mitigate obesity-associated diseases. Nucleobindin-2 (Nucb2) is thought to be post-translationally processed into bioactive nesfatin-1 peptide, which reportedly induces satiety, causes weight loss, and thus improves  sensitivity. Here, we show that deletion of Nucb2 did not affect food intake or adiposity and, instead, caused  in mice fed a high-fat diet. In addition, ablation of Nucb2 in orexigenic hypothalamic Agrp neurons did not affect food intake, and nesfatin-1 was detectable in serum, despite global deletion of Nucb2 protein. Upon high-fat diet feeding, the loss of Nucb2 exacerbated metabolic inflammation in adipose tissue macrophages in an NFκB-dependent manner without inducing classical M1 or alternative -like macrophage polarization. Furthermore, the loss of Nucb2 in myeloid cells but not in adipocytes mediated the  in response to a high-fat diet.

Therefore, we examined whether sulfated steroids are linked with weight status and associated comorbidities in obese children. Methods We analyzed 66 obese children (mean age 10.5 ± 2.5 years, 57.6% female, 53.9% prepubertal, mean BMI 27.0 ± 4.6 kg/, 50% with BMI-SDS reduction >0.5, 50% without BMI-SDS reduction) who participated in an outpatient 1-year intervention program based on exercise, behavior and nutrition therapy. We measured intact sulfated steroids (cholesterol sulfate (CS), pregnenolone sulfate (PregS), 17αOH pregnenolone sulfate (17OH-PregS), 16αOH dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (16OH-DHEAS), DHEAS, androstenediol-3-sulfate, androsterone sulfate and epiandrosterone sulfate) by LC-MS/MS, and  index HOMA, lipids, blood pressure at baseline and 1 year later. Results All sulfated steroids except 17OH-PregS, 16OH-DHEAS, androsterone sulfate and epiandrosterone sulfate were higher in boys compared to girls. Concentrations of CS before intervention were higher in children who lost weight. After 1 year of treatment, both groups showed increased levels of DHEAS, 16OH-DHEAS and androstenediol-3-sulfate, but PregS was only increased in children with weight loss. None of the steroid sulfates was significantly related to cardiovascular risk factors or HOMA except 17OH-PregS, which was associated with systolic blood pressure both in cross-sectional (β-coefficient: 0.09 ± 0.07, P = 0.020) and longitudinal analyses (β-coefficient: 0.06 ± 0.04, P = 0.013) in multiple linear regression analyses. Conclusions Since higher steroid sulfation capacity was associated with successful weight intervention in children disruption of sulfation may be associated with difficulties to lose weight.

Prior studies identified conserved T-cell receptor (TCR) chain families in obese AT, but the presence and clonal expansion of specific TCR sequences in obesity has not been assessed. We characterized AT and liver CD8 and CD4 TCR repertoires of mice fed a low-fat diet (LFD) and high-fat diet (HFD) using deep sequencing of the TCRβ chain to quantify clonal expansion, gene usage, and CDR3 sequence. In AT CD8 T cells, HFD reduced TCR diversity, increased the prevalence of public TCR clonotypes, and selected for TCR CDR3 regions enriched in positively charged and less polarized amino acids. Although TCR repertoire alone could distinguish between LFD- and HFD-fed mice, these properties of the CDR3 region of AT CD8 T cells from HFD-fed mice led us to examine the role of negatively charged and nonpolar isolevuglandin (isoLG) adduct-containing antigen-presenting cells within AT. IsoLG-adducted protein species were significantly higher in AT macrophages of HFD-fed mice; isoLGs were elevated in -polarized macrophages, promoting CD8 T-cell activation. Our findings demonstrate that clonal TCR expansion that favors positively charged CDR3s accompanies HFD-induced obesity, which may be an antigen-driven response to isoLG accumulation in macrophages.© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30151392> Saponins Regulate Macrophage Polarization under Hyperglycemic Condition via NF-B Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p> saponins (PNS), the principal constituents derived from , have been extensively used for treating cardiocerebral vascular diseases in China and other Asian countries.

PNS, especially the high-dose PNS, remarkably increased  phenotype ratio in macrophages cultured with hyperglycemia, and the mRNA expression of Ym1 and arginase 1 in macrophages was also upregulated. Meanwhile, PNS remarkably increased the protein expression of arginase 1 and decreased IB-alpha phosphorylation and subunits of NF-B p50 and p65 from macrophages in culture medium with hyperglycemia. Taken together, our work demonstrated that PNS promote macrophages to transform  phenotype under hyperglycemic conditions through downregulating NF-B signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30380017>Long-term effects of a preconception lifestyle intervention on cardiometabolic health of overweight and obese women.</a></h2><p>The global prevalence of obesity in women keeps increasing. The preconception period may be a window of opportunity to improve lifestyle, reduce obesity and improve cardiometabolic health. This study assessed the effect of a preconception lifestyle intervention on long-term cardiometabolic health in two randomized controlled trials (RCTs).Participants of the LIFEstyle and RADIEL preconception lifestyle intervention studies with a baseline body mass index (BMI) ≥29 kg/ were eligible for this follow-up study. Both studies randomized between a lifestyle intervention targeting physical activity, diet and behaviour modification or usual care. We assessed cardiometabolic health 6 years after randomization.In the LIFEstyle study (n = 111) and RADIEL study (n = 39), no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups were found for body composition, blood pressure, arterial stiffness, fasting glucose, homeostasis model assessment of , HbA1c, lipids and high sensitive C-reactive protein levels 6 years after randomization. Participants of the LIFEstyle study who successfully lost ≥5% bodyweight or reached a BMI <29 kg/ during the intervention (n = 22, [44%]) had lower weight (-8.1 kg; 99% CI [-16.6 to -0.9]), BMI (-3.3 kg/; [-6.5 to -0.8]), waist circumference (-8.2 cm; [-15.3 to -1.3]), fasting glucose (-0.5 mmol/L; [-1.1 to -0.0]), HbA1c (-4.1 mmol/mol; [-9.1 to -0.8]), and higher HDL-C (0.3 mmol/L; [0.1-0.5]) compared with controls.We found no evidence of improved cardiometabolic health 6 years after a preconception lifestyle intervention among overweight and obese women in two RCTs. Women who successfully lost weight during the intervention had better cardiometabolic health 6 years later, emphasizing the potential of successful preconception lifestyle improvement.© The Author(s) 2018.

The present study was designed to investigate the anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory and toxic activities of celastrol-loaded nanomicelles (nano-celastrol) in diet-induced obese mice. Celastrol was loaded into PEG-PCL nanoparticles, yielding nano-celastrol with optimal size, spherical morphology, good bioavailability, slower peak time and clearance in mice. Nano-celastrol (5 or 7.5 mg/kg/d of celastrol) was administered into diet-induced obese C57BL/6 N male mice for 3 weeks. As result, higher dose nano-celastrol reduced body weight and body fat mass in an equally effective manner as regular celastrol, although lower dose nano-celastrol showed less activity. Similarly, nano-celastrol improved glucose tolerance in mice equally well as regular celastrol, whereas higher dose nano-celastrol improved the response to . As for macrophage M1/ polarization in liver, nano-celastrol reduced the expression of macrophage M1 biomarkers (e.g., IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, iNOS) in a dose-dependent manner and marginally increased the expression of macrophage  biomarkers (e.g., Arg-1, IL-10). Moreover, celastrol could cause anus irritation and disturb intestinal and colonic integrity, whereas nano-celastrol did not cause any injury to mice. Collectively, nano-celastrol represents a translatable therapeutic opportunity for treating diet-induced obesity in humans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We aim to study the profile of duodenal cytokines and chemokines in patients with morbid obesity (MO), its relation with  (IR) and the intake of metformin, and with the evolution of MO after sleeve gastrectomy (SG).Duodenal levels of 24 cytokines and 9 chemokines were analyzed in 14 nonobese and in 54 MO who underwent SG: with lower IR (MO-lower-IR), with higher IR (MO-higher-IR), and with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin (MO-metf-T2DM).MO-lower-IR had higher levels of cytokines related to Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17, Th22, M1 macrophages, and chemokines involved in the recruitment of macrophages and T-lymphocytes (p < 0.05), and total (CD68 expression) and M1 macrophages (ITGAX expression) (p < 0.05) when compared with nonobese patients, but with a decrease in  macrophages (MRC1 expression) (p < 0.05). In MO-higher-IR, these chemokines and cytokines decreased and were similar to those found in nonobese patients. In MO-metf-T2DM, only IL-4 (Th2) and IL-22 (Th22) increased their levels with regard to MO-higher-IR (p < 0.05). In MO-higher-IR and MO-metf-T2DM, there was a decrease of CD68 expression (p < 0.05) while ITGAX and MRC1 were similar with regard to MO-lower-IR. We found an association between CXCL8, TNFβ and IL-2 with the evolution of body mass index (BMI) after SG (p < 0.05).There is an association between a higher IR and a lower duodenal immune response in MO, with a slight increase in those patients with metformin treatment.

Proopiomelanocortin deficiency. GeneReviews® [Internet]. Seattle (WA): University of Washington, Seattle, 1993-2018], yielding several products including adrenocorticotrophic (ACTH) and melanocyte stimulating hormones (MSH). These peptides have roles in the regulation of food intake, energy homeostasis, adrenal steroidogenesis, melanocyte stimulation and immune modulation. Rare mutations in the POMC gene can lead to ACTH deficiency and thus isolated hypocortisolism. The first cases of POMC mutation were documented by Krude et al. in 1998 [Krude H, Biebermann H, Luck W, Horn R, Brabant G, et al. Severe early-onset obesity, adrenal insufficiency and red hair pigmentation caused by POMC mutations in humans. Nat Genet 1998;19:155-7]. Mutations in the POMC gene were linked with a clinical phenotype of adrenal insufficiency, red hair pigmentation, early onset and rapidly progressive obesity, early onset type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism and growth hormone deficiency. Case presentation We describe a prepubertal Hispanic boy with a novel homozygous POMC mutation with severe obesity, hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency and abnormal reddish hair pigmentation. The patient presented as a 2-year-old with exponential weight gain, abnormal thyroid labs and speech delay. Laboratory testing demonstrated central adrenal insufficiency and genetic testing confirmed a homozygous mutation (nucleotide change c.20_21ins25) in exon 3 of the POMC gene. Replacement therapy with thyroid hormone and hydrocortisone was coupled to a slight decrease in the rate of weight gain, although hyperphagia persisted. Parent-directed nutrition and activity education as well as attempts to restrict access to food resulted in a plateau of the body mass index (BMI). At 4 years of age, metformin treatment was initiated with the patient showing evolving signs of  and failure of lifestyle/dietary intervention to adequately decrease the BMI. Over a 3-year metformin treatment span, the BMI decreased from 34.9 kg/ to 32.9 kg/. Conclusions We demonstrate a possible role for metformin in stemming progressive weight gain, thereby impacting the early onset obesity due to hyperphagia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664204>Genetic polymorphisms of melatonin receptors 1A and 1B may result in disordered lipid metabolism in obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition in which a woman's levels of the sex hormones (estrogen and progesterone) are out of balance, leading to the growth of ovarian cysts. PCOS can affect the menstrual cycle, fertility, cardiac function and even appearance of women. Therefore, we aimed to explore the genetic polymorphism of the melatonin receptors 1A and 1B in obese patients with PCOS to identify a new theoretical basis for its treatment. Patients presenting with PCOS (n=359) were enrolled and classified into an obese OB‑PCOS group [body mass index (BMI) of PCOS patients ≥25 kg/] or a nonobese NOB‑PCOS group, and 215 oviduct infertile patients who experienced normal ovulation were used as the control group. All baseline characteristics, endocrine hormone levels, lipid and glucose metabolism, and  indices were measured. The genotypes of rs2119882 within the MTNR1A gene and of rs10830963 within the MTNR1B gene were determined by PCR‑RFLP; the genotype frequency and the difference in the distribution of allele frequency were compared. For rs2119882, C allele carriers who were not diagnosed with PCOS had an increased risk of developing PCOS, and C allele carriers with PCOS had an increased risk of developing OB‑PCOS. For rs10830963, G allele carriers who were not diagnosed with PCOS had an increased risk of developing PCOS. The TT genotype in rs2119882 and the CC genotype in rs10830963 were protective factors for OB‑PCOS, and increased levels of LH, testosterone, and estradiol and abnormal menstruation were key risk factors for PCOS. Furthermore, the TT genotype at the rs2119882 site was the key protective factor for OB‑PCOS patients. Our study found that MTNR1A rs2119882 and MTNR1B rs10830963 could increase the risk for PCOS and cause glycolipid metabolism disorder in PCOS patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30306882>Adipocytokines in Non-functional Adrenal Incidentalomas and Relation with  Parameters.</a></h2><p>Adrenal incidentalomas are diagnosed incidentally during radiological screenings and require endocrinological investigations for hormonal activity and malignancy. In certain studies, it has been reported that non-functional incidentalomas can be associated with high adipocytokines levels affecting the  just like the adipose tissue with metabolic syndrome. Here, we studied serum adipocytokine levels including leptin, resistin, visfatin, omentin 1 and adiponectin in subjects with non-functional adrenal incidentaloma.Seventy-seven (77) patients (Female 57; Male 20) with non-functional adrenal incidentaloma (NFAI) were enrolled in the study. All patients' past medical history, physical examination including Body Mass Index (BMI) and waist circumference were performed. The patients' demographic, radiologic, hormonal and biochemical parameters were recorded. To compare the parameters, a control group (CG) (n=30) was formed from healthy volunteers. Both groups were matched for age, gender, waist circumference and BMI. Serum adipocytokines including leptin, resistin, visfatin, omentin 1 and adiponectin were measured quantitatively by ELISA. Fasting plasma glucose, , sodium, potassium, cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), lipid profiles, and dehidroepiandrostenedion sulphate (DHEAS) were measured.Mean age of the patients was 52.2±10.4 years. BMI and waist circumference of NFAI patients were 26.2±3.28 kg/ and 90.2 ±7.5cm, respectively. The mean age of the control group was 48.0±8.16. BMI and waist circumference values for the control group were 25.3±3.5 kg/ and 88.3±9.6 cm, respectively. When both groups were compared for age, gender, BMI and waist circumference were non-significant (p>0.05). Serum fasting , total cholesterol, LDL, triglyceride levels of the NFAI group were significantly higher than CG (p<0.05). The  index (HOMAIR) values of the NFAI subjects were found to be higher than CG (2.5±1.37, 1.1±0.3 p=0.00). Resistin level of NFAI group was also found to be higher than CG [286.6 ng/L vs. 197 ng/L; (P=0,00)], respectively. Leptin levels of NFAI were significantly higher than CG [441.1 ng/mL vs. 186.5 ng/mL; (P=0.00)] respectively. Adiponectin levels were significantly reduced in the NFAI group than in the CG [10.7 mg/L vs. 30.8 mg/L; (P=0.00)]. Comparision of visfatin and omentin levels was nonsignificant.In this study on subjects with non-functional adrenal incidentaloma, we found not only significantly decreased serum adiponectin levels but also increased leptin, resistin levels as well as dyslipidemia, hypertension and high  index. All of which could affect  and cardiovascular risk factors. The underlying mechanisms of these findings are unknown, hence further studies are needed.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29408981>Excessive Adiposity and Metabolic Dysfunction Relate to Reduced Natriuretic Peptide During RAAS Activation in HIV.</a></h2><p>Natriuretic peptides (NPs) negatively feedback on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and play a critical role in preserving cardiac structure and maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Well-treated HIV-infected individuals are at risk for fat redistribution and demonstrate evidence of RAAS dysregulation, which relates to metabolic dysfunction. We investigated circulating NPs in relation to RAAS physiology and metrics of body composition in HIV.We assessed atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and amino terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) during acute activation of the RAAS using a low-sodium controlled diet among 20 HIV-infected and 10 non-HIV-infected individuals well phenotyped for body composition.BNP was significantly lower [median, 60 (interquartile range, 44, 152) pg/mL vs 196 (91, 251) pg/mL, respectively; P = 0.04], and serum aldosterone was higher, among HIV-infected than among non-HIV-infected individuals. BNP was significantly and inversely associated with body composition [waist circumference: r = -0.46 (P = 0.04); BMI: r = -0.55 (P = 0.01); body adiposity index: r = -0.49 (P = 0.03)], metabolic indices [total cholesterol: r = -0.44 (P = 0.05),  calculated by using homeostatic model assessment: r = -0.44 (P = 0.05); mean arterial pressure: r = -0.44 (P = 0.05)], and serum aldosterone (r = -0.49; P = 0.03) among the HIV-infected group. These relationships were not demonstrated in the non-HIV-infected group. In a four-group comparison stratifying by HIV serostatus and above or below a body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/, BNP decreased significantly across groups; it was highest in non-HIV-infected patients with a BMI <25 kg/ and lowest in HIV-infected patients with a BMI ≥25 kg/ (overall P = 0.01).Relatively reduced NP, particularly BNP, among HIV-infected individuals with excess adiposity may contribute to reduced suppression of aldosterone and potentially drive aldosterone-mediated metabolic complications. Strategies that target RAAS blockade and/or augment NPs may be useful to reduce cardiometabolic disease among HIV-infected individuals in whom these systems are perturbed.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29635500>Normal-weight obesity and clinical outcomes in nondiabetic chronic kidney disease patients: a cohort study.</a></h2><p>Normal-weight obesity (NWO), defined by a normal body mass index (BMI) and high body fat percentage, has been shown to be associated with cardiometabolic dysfunction and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality in the general population. However, little is known about the clinical implications of NWO among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).The aim of this study was to assess the characteristics and outcomes of nondiabetic CKD patients with NWO.A total of 178 nondiabetic patients with stages 3-5 CKD were prospectively followed for a median of 4.9 y. The patients were classified into 3 different adiposity phenotypes: nonobese [BMI (in kg/) <25 and fat mass percentage (FM%) ≤25% for men or ≤35% for women], NWO (BMI <25 and FM% >25% for men or >35% for women), and preobese-obese (BMI ≥25). FM% was determined using the Body Composition Monitor, a multifrequency bioimpedance spectroscopy device. The outcome was a composite of cardiovascular events or all-cause mortality.The prevalence of NWO was 28.1% among nondiabetic CKD patients with a normal BMI. NWO patients were older, had lower lean body mass, and had higher plasma interleukin-6 concentrations than nonobese patients. However, homeostatic model assessment for  levels did not differ between the 2 groups. NWO patients showed a significant 3-fold higher risk of the composite outcome (HR 2.96, 95% CI: 1.13, 7.77; P < 0.05) than did nonobese patients in the fully adjusted model. Preobese-obese patients were not at increased risk compared to nonobese patients.NWO was associated with the worst prognosis among the 3 different adiposity phenotypes in nondiabetic CKD patients.

However, the factors in the adipose tissue microenvironment that control ATM phenotypic polarization and bioenergetics remain unknown. We have recently shown that oxidized phospholipids (OxPL) uniquely regulate gene expression and cellular metabolism in  macrophages, but the presence of the  phenotype in adipose tissue has not been reported. Here we show, using extracellular flux analysis, that ATMs isolated from lean mice are metabolically inhibited. We identify a unique population of CX3CR1/F4/80 ATMs that resemble the  (Txnrd1HO1) phenotype to be the predominant ATM phenotype in lean adipose tissue. In contrast, ATMs isolated from obese mice had characteristics typical of the / (CD11cCD206) phenotype with highly activated bioenergetics. Quantifying individual OxPL species in the stromal vascular fraction of murine adipose tissue, using targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, revealed that high fat diet-induced adipose tissue expansion led to a disproportional increase in full-length over truncated OxPL species. In vitro studies showed that macrophages respond to truncated OxPL species by suppressing bioenergetics and up-regulating antioxidant programs, mimicking the  phenotype of ATMs isolated from lean mice. Conversely, full-length OxPL species induce proinflammatory gene expression and an activated bioenergetic profile that mimics ATMs isolated from obese mice. Together, these data identify a redox-regulatory Mox macrophage phenotype to be predominant in lean adipose tissue and demonstrate that individual OxPL species that accumulate in adipose tissue instruct ATMs to adapt their phenotype and bioenergetic profile to either maintain redox homeostasis or to promote inflammation.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

We hypothesized that physiologic factors such as low energy expenditure and physical activity would be present in AA compared with white women in pregnancy.We aimed to identify physiologic risk factors for disordered energy balance in AA and white women early in pregnancy.This was a cross-sectional study in 66 pregnant women with obesity, between 14 and 16 wk of gestation. Energy intake was calculated using the intake-balance method. Energy expenditure was measured in free-living conditions [total daily energy expenditure (TDEE)] over 7 d with the use of doubly labelled water and during sleep [sleeping EE (SleepEE)] in a room calorimeter. Body composition was measured by air displacement plethysmography and physical activity by accelerometers. Markers of metabolic health were obtained from fasting blood and urine.AA (n = 34) and white (n = 32) women were comparable in age (mean ± SEM: 27.7 ± 0.6 y), enrollment body mass index [mean ± SEM (in kg/): 36.9 ± 0.7], and body fat (mean ± SEM: 45.0% ± 0.6%). AA women had more fat-free mass (P = 0.01) and tended to be more -resistant (homeostasis model assessment of , P = 0.06). Energy intake was significantly lower in AA than in white women (2499 ± 76 compared with 2769 ± 58 kcal/d, P = 0.001), although absolute TDEE was comparable (AA: 2590 ± 77 kcal/d; white: 2711 ± 56 kcal/d; P = 0.21). After adjusting for body composition, TDEE was significantly lower in AA women (-231 ± 74 kcal/d, P = 0.003), as was SleepEE (-81 ± 37 kcal/d, P = 0.03). Physical activity, substrate oxidation, and metabolic biomarkers (triiodothyronine and thyroxine concentrations, catecholamine excretion) were not significantly different between groups.Body mass-adjusted energy expenditure is significantly lower in AA than in white pregnant women. Energy intake recommendations for pregnancy do not consider this difference and may therefore overestimate energy requirements in AA women. This may lead to unintentional overeating and contribute to the disparity of excess gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention that is more prevalent in AA women.

A disturbance in the regulation of energy metabolism can be a key reason for the formation of  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction leads to oxidative stress, which increases the production of proinflammatory cytokines. In this regard, the aim of this study was to identify the relationship of the copy number of mtDNA in adipose tissue from different locations (subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), mesentery (Mes), greater omentum (GO)), liver biopsy samples and mononuclear blood cells (MNCs) with endothelial dysfunction markers (eNOS, ET-1, iCAM-1, vCAM-1, VEGF) and inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, CRP, leptin) in obese patients (body mass index (BMI) > 35 kg/m) with and without type 2 diabetes.The study included 88 obese patients (BMI > 35 kg/) treated at the Kaliningrad Region Hospital. The control group consisted of 20 healthy donors. To measure mtDNA copy number we used droplet digital PCR. The concentrations of molecules (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, eNOS, ET-1, iCAM-1, vCAM-1, VEGF) were measured in plasma using the following sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Quantitative determination of leptin was evaluated by flow-fluorimetry on a «Bio-Plex Protein Assay System». Statistical analysis and graphs were obtained in R Statistical Software (version 3.3.1).The systemic character of chronic subclinical inflammation in obesity is established, and an increase in the level of endothelial dysfunction molecules was observed in the blood plasma. The levels of TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-8 were positively correlated with increases in BMI, serum glucose and cholesterol levels.The copy number of mtDNA in various fat stores was higher in obese patients with type 2 diabetes than in obese patients without diabetes or in the control subjects and was related to the levels of leptin and proinflammatory cytokines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474632>[Role of Angiogenesis and Chronic Inflammation in Fat Hypertrophy in NASH Pathology].</a></h2><p>Tissue expansion and chronic inflammation in adipose tissue (AT) are closely related to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) pathology. Angiogenesis is initiated by the detachment of pericytes (PCs) from vessels in AT. This process is necessary for the development of AT in obesity. The detachment is caused by excessive platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) derived from M1-macrophages (Mφ) infiltrating obese AT. On the other hand, AT of tamoxifen-induced systemic PDGF receptor-β knockout mice showed decreased detachment of PCs from vessels in obesity, thereby attenuating hypertrophy of AT mediated by neoangiogenesis, resulting in protection from the development of chronic AT inflammation and systemic . The selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) inhibitor eplerenone (Ep) suppresses chronic inflammation in fat and the liver, improves glucose and lipid metabolism, and inhibits body weight and fat mass gain in mice fed a high-fat diet. As a novel mechanism, Ep increases energy expenditure and suppresses fat accumulation, thereby controlling the polarity of visceral AT Mφ from inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory  dominant. In addition, Ep directly inhibits the activation of signals 1 and 2 of NLRP3-inflammasomes in Mφ, which is an inflammatory mechanism closely involved in the development of NASH. Thus, we propose novel therapeutic approaches to NASH. Inhibition of PDGF receptor-β signaling prevents AT hypertrophy by regulating AT angiogenesis, and MR inhibitors directly suppress chronic inflammation in the AT and liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29701665>Adropin Contributes to Anti-Atherosclerosis by Suppressing Monocyte-Endothelial Cell Adhesion and Smooth Muscle Cell Proliferation.</a></h2><p>Adropin, a peptide hormone expressed in liver and brain, is known to improve  and endothelial dysfunction. Serum levels of adropin are negatively associated with the severity of coronary artery disease. However, it remains unknown whether adropin could modulate atherogenesis. We assessed the effects of adropin on inflammatory molecule expression and human THP1 monocyte adhesion in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), foam cell formation in THP1 monocyte-derived macrophages, and the migration and proliferation of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) in vitro and atherogenesis in  mice in vivo. Adropin was expressed in THP1 monocytes, their derived macrophages, HASMCs, and HUVECs. Adropin suppressed tumor necrosis factor α-induced THP1 monocyte adhesion to HUVECs, which was associated with vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 downregulation in HUVECs. Adropin shifted the phenotype to anti-inflammatory  rather than pro-inflammatory M1 via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ upregulation during monocyte differentiation into macrophages. Adropin had no significant effects on oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced foam cell formation in macrophages. In HASMCs, adropin suppressed the migration and proliferation without inducing apoptosis via ERK1/2 and Bax downregulation and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/Bcl2 upregulation. Chronic administration of adropin to  mice attenuated the development of atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta, with reduced the intra-plaque monocyte/macrophage infiltration and smooth muscle cell content. Thus, adropin could serve as a novel therapeutic target in atherosclerosis and related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31370035>Mindfulness-based Group Intervention for an Adolescent Girl at Risk for Type 2 Diabetes: A Case Report.</a></h2><p>Behavioral lifestyle interventions to lower body mass index (BMI; kg/) are the standard approach for preventing adolescent-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D). Unfortunately, existing programs have had limited long-term success of lessening , the key physiological risk indicator for T2D. Underlying psychosocial factors, particularly depressive symptoms, have been related to , independent of BMI or body fat. Preliminary evidence indicates that mindfulness-based programs show promise for intervening with depression and T2D; yet, this approach is novel and data in adolescents are scarce.The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the benefits, and potential underlying mechanisms, of a mindfulness-based intervention in adolescents at-risk for T2D with depressive symptoms and (2) to consider clinical implementation with this specific, psychologically, and medically at-risk adolescent population.The research team conducted a case study report. The setting was an outpatient therapy clinic and research laboratory at a university.The participant was a 16-y-old female with elevated depressive symptoms, obesity, and , and a family history of T2D.The intervention was a 6-wk mindfulness-based group program. The key outcomes were patterns of change in trait mindfulness, depression, and  in the course of a 1-y follow-up. Secondary outcomes were patterns of change in reported-overeating patterns and cortisol awakening response.Compared with her scores at baseline, the participant displayed a pattern of increased trait mindfulness, decreased depressive symptoms, and lessening of  immediately following the group program and at 1 y. BMI and body fat were stable. There was a remission in reported-overeating and a pattern of declining cortisol awakening response 1 y later. Participant feedback on the intervention was generally positive but also provided potential modifications to strengthen acceptability and effectiveness.The current case results suggest that teaching mindfulness skills to adolescent girls at risk for T2D with depressive symptoms may offer distinctive advantages for treating depression and T2D risk. Clinical implications for increasing the success of implementing mindfulness-based programs in this population include a focus on promotion of social connectedness within the group, implementation of strategies to increase adherence to home practice activities, and the use of facilitation techniques to promote concrete understanding of abstract mindfulness concepts.

They are associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, autophagy, and . Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitor, has been reported to show multiple biological activities beyond the antidiabetic property. This study was aimed at investigating the effect of sitagliptin on hepatic steatosis, , inflammation, and autophagy and exploring the underlying molecular mechanism. In the current study, ob/ob mice, a mouse model of genetic obesity and diabetes, were administered via gavage with sitagliptin 50 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks. Changes in glycolipid metabolism, inflammatory responses, and autophagy in the liver were evaluated. Body weight gain, lipid metabolic disorder, and hepatic steatosis as well as systemic and hepatic  sensitivity in ob/ob mice were significantly attenuated after sitagliptin treatment. Furthermore, sitagliptin decreased inflammatory responses by regulating macrophage M1/ polarization and inhibiting the activities of NF-B and JNK. Moreover, sitagliptin increased the levels of phosphorylation of AMPK and decreased those of mTOR. This study indicates that sitagliptin significantly ameliorates the development of hepatic steatosis and  in ob/ob mice by inhibiting inflammatory responses and activating autophagy via AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30789980>Mild Physiologic Hyperglycemia Induces Hepatic  in Healthy Normal Glucose-Tolerant Participants.</a></h2><p>Chronic hyperglycemia worsens skeletal muscle  and β-cell function.

Aberrant macrophage activation to M1 or  is characterized by a deleterious state of chronic inflammation and loss of positive trophic signals. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is used to treat diabetes due to its beneficial role against . The present study examined the effect of GLP-1 on macrophage activation, which contributed to  polarization and secretion of anti-inflammatory factors. In addition, the present study demonstrated that GLP-1 was able to reduce M1 polarization and inflammatory response by using the murine monocyte/macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and detecting M1/-specific genes. RAW264.7 cells were incubated with GLP-1 in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide or interleukin-4, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and signal transduction and transcriptional activation factor 3 (STAT3) activity was assessed by quantification of phosphorylation expression and macrophage polarization was determined by detecting M1/-specific genes expression. The results demonstrated that GLP-1/GLP-1 receptor attenuated the phosphorylation of JNK and its signal transduction through the cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A signaling pathway, while the phosphorylation of STAT3 increased through following treatment with GLP-1. The present study observed that GLP-1 exerts its beneficial effects on macrophage polarization by modulating the JNK/STAT3 signaling pathway.

A total of 7 619 elderly people aged over 60 years, and local household registered in Kunshan city, Jiangsu province in 2016 were included as subjects to analyze the incidence rate, influencing factors and causes of death in patients with NAFLD and the relationship between MS and mortality rate in patients with NAFLD. According to different data, using Kruskal-Wallis H test, analysis of variance, t-test, chi-square test or logistic regression analysis were performed.  The prevalence of NAFLD was14.10% (1 074/7 619) among the elderly over 60 years in Kunshan city, Jiangsu province in 2016, and the female prevalence rate was significantly higher than that of males ( < 0.05). When the body mass index (BMI) was < 32 (kg/m(2)), the prevalence of NAFLD increased with the increase of BMI index. When BMI was 18.5-23.9 kg/, 24-27.9 kg/m(2) and > 32 kg/m(2), the prevalence of NAFLD was significantly higher in females than males ( < 0.05). There was no significant difference in prevalence between males and females with BMI <18.5 kg/m(2) and 28~31.9 kg/m(2) ( > 0.05). BMI gradually decreased ( < 0.05) with the increase of age, and the incidence of NAFLD showed a downward trend ( < 0.05). An independent risk factors for NAFLD ( < 0.01) were gender ( = 0.616), age ( = 0.970), waist circumference ( = 1.065), triglycerides ( = 1.162), BMI ( = 1.238), and diastolic blood pressure ( = 1.012). The probability of NAFLD combined with three and four kinds of MS was significantly higher than control group ( < 0.05). Subjects' mortality rate during the follow-up period was 1.94%, 2.23% in the NAFLD group, and 1.89% in the control group. Average life expectancy was 75.58 years in NAFLD group and 78.68 years in the control group. All deaths in NAFLD groups were associated with MS, and 70.83% combined with three or more MS. The primary cause of death in NAFLD group was tumors (37.5%), followed by cardiovascular disease (16.67%) and three cases died directly from MS.  The prevalence of NAFLD in the elderly population in Kunshan city, Jiangsu province is relatively low, which may be associated with local diet and high-intensity workouts. MS disorders represented by obesity and diabetes mellitus are closely associated to the onset of NAFLD. Obesity is the most important risk factor for the incidence of NAFLD in the local elderly population over 60 years old. However, the risk of NAFLD should not be neglected in people with normal BMI, especially in aged women, and the weight control should be the most important means to prevent and control NAFLD. NAFLD may increase mortality rate and reduce life expectancy in the elderly population. The main reason to cause death in the elderly with NAFLD is cardiovascular disease and malignant tumors. Simultaneously, multiple MS development may increase the death rate in elderly with NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30779092>Diet quality and eating patterns in euthymic bipolar patients.</a></h2><p>As mood disorders and obesity are interrelated, and both are linked to increased morbidity and mortality, risk factors for obesity should be identified and closely monitored in patients with bipolar disorder (BD).

Associations of diet quality with subjects' weight, waist circumference (WC),  index and clinical features of BD were also analyzed.BD patients had lower Mediterranean Diet Score than controls. Using principal analysis, four dietary patterns were revealed in the BD group (western-type, pro-healthy carbohydrates, unhealthy snacks, and meats and potatoes). Over 70% of patients with BD had Body Mass Index above 25kg/. The values of Fasting Triglycerides Glucose Index and WC were significantly higher in BD patients than in the control group. No significant association between diet quality indices and the clinical course of BD was found.In our work, euthymic bipolar patients showed unhealthy dietary patterns and had lower adherence to the Mediterranean diet than the controls.

A cross-sectional analysis using these data was conducted from April 31, 2018, to May 1, 2019.Chronotype, measured via a continuous scale with higher scores indicating greater evening preferences, and social jet lag, measured as the continuous difference in actigraphy sleep midpoint in hours from midnight on weekends vs weekdays, with higher values representing more delayed sleep timing on weekends.Adiposity, measured via anthropometry and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. For a subset of 479 adolescents with blood samples, cardiometabolic risk scores were computed as the mean of 5 sex- and cohort-specific z scores for waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, inversely scaled high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and log-transformed triglycerides and homeostatic model of .Among the 804 adolescents in the study, 418 were girls and 386 were boys, with a mean (SD) age of 13.2 (0.9) years. In multivariable models adjusted for age, puberty, season, and sociodemographics, associations of chronotype and social jet lag with adiposity varied by sex. For girls, greater evening preference was associated with a 0.58-cm (95% CI, 0.12-1.03 cm; P = .04 for interaction) higher waist circumference and 0.16 kg/ (95% CI, 0.01-0.31 kg/; P = .03 for interaction) higher fat mass index as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; each hour of social jet lag was associated with a 1.19-cm (95% CI, 0.04-2.35 cm; P = .21 for interaction) higher waist circumference and 0.45 kg/ (95% CI, 0.09-0.82 kg/; P = .01 for interaction) higher fat mass index as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Associations of social jet lag and evening chronotypes persisted for many measures of adiposity after adjustment for sleep duration and other lifestyle behaviors. By contrast, no associations were observed in boys. There were no associations with the cardiometabolic risk score for either sex, although statistical power was low for this outcome.Evening chronotypes and social jet lag were associated with greater adiposity in adolescent girls but not adolescent boys. Interventions aimed at improving sleep schedules may be useful for obesity prevention, especially in girls.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29742114>The magnitude of obesity and metabolic syndrome among diabetic chronic kidney disease population: A nationwide study.</a></h2><p>Although the prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) among dialysis patients has been exceeding than general population, little is known regarding obesity and MetS in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD). We aimed to find the magnitude of obesity and MetS and their associations with impaired renal function among type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients.A national survey of T2DM patients was collected in the Thai National Health Security Office database during 2014-5. The sampling frame was designated as distinct geographic regions throughout the country. A stratified two-stage cluster sampling was used to select the study population. Anthropometry and 12-hour fasting blood samples were obtained by trained personnel. BMI of ≥25 kg/ was classified as obesity. MetS was defined as having elevated waist circumference (>90 and >80 cm in men and women, respectively) plus any two of the followings: triglyceride ≥150 mg/dL, HDL-C <40 in men or <50 mg/dL in women, blood pressure ≥130/85 mmHg, and fasting blood sugar ≥100 mg/dL. CKD was defined as an impaired renal function (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2 according to the CKD-EPI equation). Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between obesity and MetS with the presence of CKD.A total of 32,616 diabetic patients were finally recruited from 997 hospitals. The mean age was 61.5±10.9 years with 67.5% women. Of the participants, 35.4% were CKD patients. The prevalence of obesity was 46.5% in CKD and 54.1% in non-CKD patients with T2DM (p<0.001). In contrast, the prevalence of MetS in CKD patients was higher than their non-CKD counterparts (71.3 vs 68.8%, p<0.001). Moreover, there was an association between the prevalence of MetS with CKD stage from 3a to 5 (70.1, 72.3, 73.4, and 72.7%, respectively, p trend = 0.02). MetS, but not obesity, had a significant association with CKD in T2DM patients after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities [OR 1.14; 95% CI 1.06-1.22, p<0.001]. When stratified by each component of MetS, only high serum triglyceride and low HDL-C levels were increased in patients with CKD stage 4 and 5 compared with CKD stage 3 (p<0.001) and had a significant relationship with impaired renal function.There were relatively high prevalences of both obesity and MetS in T2DM patients. A higher prevalence of MetS, but lower prevalence of obesity, was observed among diabetic CKD group compared with their non-CKD counterparts. MetS, as a surrogate of , appeared to be more important than obesity in the development of impaired renal function in diabetic population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30092569>High Dietary ω-6:ω-3 PUFA Ratio Is Positively Associated with Excessive Adiposity and Waist Circumference.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to analyze dietary ω-6:ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ratio and its association with adiposity and serum adiponectin levels in a Mexican population.In this cross-sectional study, individuals with a BMI ≥ 18.5 kg/, were classified using four methods to measure adiposity. Parameters of body composition were measured by InBody 3.0. Diet intake was evaluated prospectively using a 3-day written food record. Serum high-molecular weight adiponectin isoform was measured using an ELISA assay. Biochemical and adiposity variables were analyzed by tertiles of dietary ω-6:ω-3 PUFA ratio.A total of 170 subjects were recruited with a mean age of 36.9 ± 11.8 years. The 73.5% of subjects were women. Subjects in the higher tertile of dietary ω-6:ω-3 PUFA ratio had more adiposity and higher levels of triglycerides, VLDL-c, glucose,  and HOMA-IR than those in the first tertile (p < 0.05). Adiponectin levels showed a trend according to dietary ω-6:ω-3 PUFA ratio (p = 0.06). A linear regression model showed that waist circumference, , and HOMA-IR have positive associations with dietary ω-6:ω-3 PUFA ratio.This study suggests that high dietary ω-6:ω-3 PUFA ratio is positively associated with excessive adiposity and worse metabolic profile.© 2018 The Author(s) Published by S.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of berberine, a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid used in traditional Chinese medicine, on energy expenditure, expression of the UCP1 gene, the cell stress protein inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), apoptosis genes, and macrophage phenotype (M1 and ) in white and brown adipose tissue in an obese mouse model fed a high-fat diet. MATERIAL AND METHODS Four-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (n=20) were divided into a high-fat diet group, a normal diet group, a group treated with berberine at 100 mg/kg/d in 0.9% normal saline, and a non-treated group. Whole-body fat mass, blood glucose, , and oxygen expenditure during physical activity were measured. After 16 weeks, the mice were euthanized for examination of liver and adipose tissue. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis genes, thermogenic genes (including UCP1), and IRE1α, were investigated using immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), in white and brown adipose tissue. Magnetic cell sorting harvested M1 and  macrophages in adipose tissue. Clodronate liposomes were used to inhibit macrophage recruitment. RESULTS Berberine treatment in mice fed a high-fat diet increased energy metabolism, glucose tolerance, and expression of UCP1, and reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, macrophage recruitment, and resulted in  macrophage polarization in white adipose tissue. Polarized  macrophages showed reduced expression of apoptotic genes and IRE1α.

Whole-body protein degradation (i.e., the rate of appearance [Ra] of endogenous leucine), leucine disposal to protein synthesis (PS), deamination, and reamination, were determined before and after the HFD, both in the postabsorptive state and following a euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic, hyperaminoacidemic clamp, using isotope dilution methods.After the HFD, mean values (± SEs) for postabsorptive leucine Ra decreased by ∼20%: from 2.52 (0.15) to 2.03 (0.16) μmol x kg-1 x min-1, P < 0.049, after vs. before the HFD respectively. PS also decreased, by ∼25%: from 2.03 (0.15) to 1.57 (0.15), P < 0.045. Leucine concentration (P = 0.1) and reamination (P = 0.095) decreased moderately, whereas deamination was unchanged. Following the clamp, plasma amino acid concentrations (P < 0.001), leucine deamination (+ ∼50%, P < 0.00002), reamination (+ ∼30%, P < 0.0007), and PS (+ ∼35%, P < 0.00001) were all increased compared with postabsorptive state values, whereas endogenous leucine Ra was suppressed (by 15%, P < 0.00001, and by 25%, P < 0.001, with the primary or the reciprocal pool models, respectively). No significant differences in these  effects before compared with after the HFD were observed. Metabolic control (glycated hemoglobin), daily  requirement, and -mediated glucose disposal were unchanged after the HFD.A HFD downregulates postabsorptive protein turnover in men with T1DM, by decreasing both protein degradation and synthesis, possibly due to a subtle decrease and/or delay in amino acid absorption. It does not significantly affect the  (and amino acid sensitivity) to protein turnover, glucose disposal, and metabolic control.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30053283>Diets Low in Saturated Fat with Different Unsaturated Fatty Acid Profiles Similarly Increase Serum-Mediated Cholesterol Efflux from THP-1 Macrophages in a Population with or at Risk for Metabolic Syndrome: The Canola Oil Multicenter Intervention Trial.</a></h2><p>Cholesterol efflux plays an important role in preventing atherosclerosis progression. Vegetable oils with varying unsaturated fatty acid profiles favorably affect multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors; however, their effects on cholesterol efflux remain unclear.The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of diets low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with varying unsaturated fatty acid profiles on serum-mediated cholesterol efflux and its association with the plasma lipophilic index and central obesity.The present study is a randomized, crossover, controlled-feeding study. Participants [men: n = 50; women: n = 51; mean ± SE age: 49.5 ± 1.2 y; body mass index (in kg/): 29.4 ± 0.4] at risk for or with metabolic syndrome (MetS) were randomly assigned to 5 isocaloric diets containing the treatment oils: canola oil, high oleic acid-canola oil, DHA-enriched high oleic acid-canola oil, corn oil and safflower oil blend, and flax oil and safflower oil blend. These treatment oils were incorporated into smoothies that participants consumed 2 times/d. For a 3000-kcal diet, 60 g of treatment oil was required to provide 18% of total energy per day. Each diet period was 4 wk followed by a 2- to 4-wk washout period. We quantified cholesterol efflux capacity with a validated ex vivo high-throughput cholesterol efflux assay. Statistical analyses were performed with the use of the SAS mixed-model procedure.The 5 diets increased serum-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity from THP-1 macrophages similarly by 39%, 34%, 55%, 49% and 51%, respectively, compared with baseline (P < 0.05 for all). Waist circumference and abdominal adiposity were negatively correlated with serum-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity (r = -0.25, P = 0.01, r = -0.33, P = 0.02, respectively).Diets low in SFAs with different monounsaturated fatty acid and polyunsaturated fatty acid profiles improved serum-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity in individuals with or at risk for MetS. This mechanism may account, in part, for the cardiovascular disease benefits of diets low in SFAs and high in unsaturated fatty acids. Importantly, central obesity is inversely associated with cholesterol efflux capacity.

Mechanistic researches demonstrate that the anti-diabetic effect of MSCs is partially mediated by eliciting macrophages into an anti-inflammatory phenotype thus alleviating . However, single MSC infusion is insufficient to ameliorate sustained hyperglycemia or normalize blood glucose levels. In this study, we used decitabine (DAC), which is involved in the regulation of macrophage polarization, to test whether MSCs combined with decitabine can prolong and enhance the anti-diabetic effect in T2D mice.High-fat diet (HFD) and streptozocin (STZ) were given to induce T2D mouse model. Successfully induced T2D mice were randomly divided into four groups: T2D group, MSC group, DAC group, and MSC + DAC group. Blood glucose was monitored, and glucose tolerance and  sensitivity were evaluated during the entire analysis period. Epididymal fat was extracted for analysis of macrophage phenotype and inflammation in adipose tissue. In vitro, we examined the effect of MSC + DAC on macrophage polarization in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and explore the possible mechanism.MSC infusion effectively improved  sensitivity and glucose homeostasis in T2D mice within 1 week, whereas combination therapy of MSCs + DAC extended the anti-diabetic effects of MSCs from 1 to 4 weeks (the end of the observation). Correspondingly, more  macrophages in adipose tissue were observed in the combination therapy group over the entire study period. In vitro, compared with the MSC group, MSCs combined with decitabine more effectively polarized M1 macrophages to  macrophages. Further analysis showed that the effect of MSC + DAC on macrophage polarization was largely abrogated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) antagonist GW9662.Our data suggest that MSCs combined with decitabine can more effectively alleviate  and prolong and enhance the anti-diabetic effect of MSCs in T2D mice in part by prompting  polarization in a PPARγ-dependent manner. Thus, decitabine may be an applicable addition to MSCs for diabetes therapy. UC-MSCs combined with decitabine activate the IL4R/STAT6/STAT3/PPARγ axis to further promote  macrophage polarization in adipose tissue, reduce inflammation, improve  sensitivity, and lead to better glucose metabolism and long-term hypoglycemic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30211140>Ultrasound Grade of Liver Steatosis Is Independently Associated with the Risk of Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h2><p>The aim of the study was to explore (a) prevalence and grade of nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) among outpatients referred for abdominal ultrasound (US) examination and (b) relationship between the presence and severity of liver steatosis and metabolic syndrome (MS). This was a retrospective analysis of patients without history of liver disease examined by abdominal US in the University hospital setting. US was used to detect and semiquantitatively grade (0-3) liver steatosis. Data on patients' age, gender, body mass index (BMI), impaired glucose metabolism (IGM), atherogenic dyslipidaemia (AD), raised blood pressure (RBP), transaminases, and platelet counts were obtained from medical records. MS was defined as having at least 3 of the following components: obesity, IGM, AD, and RBP. Of the 631 patients (median age 60 years, median BMI 27.4 kg/, and 57.4% females) 71.5% were overweight and 48.5% had NAFL. In the subgroup of 159 patients with available data on the components of MS, patients with higher US grade of steatosis had significantly higher BMI and increased prevalence of obesity, IGM, AD, RBP, and accordingly more frequently had MS, whereas they did not differ in terms of age and gender. NAFL was independently associated with the risk of having MS in a multivariate model adjusted for age, gender, BMI, and IGM. The grade of liver steatosis did not correlate with the presence of liver fibrosis. We demonstrated worrisome prevalence of obesity and NAFL in the outpatient population from our geographic region. NAFL is independently associated with the risk of having MS implying worse prognosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30020457>Youth With Type 1 Diabetes Have Adipose, Hepatic, and Peripheral .</a></h2><p>Adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have difficulty obtaining optimal glucose control, which may relate to  (IR), especially during puberty. Moreover, IR increases the risk for cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in T1D. However, the tissue specificity of IR in adolescents with T1D has not been fully phenotyped.To assess adipose, hepatic, and peripheral  sensitivity in adolescents with and without T1D.Thirty-five youth with T1D [median age, 16 (first and third quartiles, 14, 17) years; 53% female; median body mass index (BMI) percentile, 82nd (55th, 96th); late puberty; median hemoglobin A1c, 8.3% (7.3%, 9.4%)] and 22 nondiabetic youth of similar age, BMI, pubertal stage, and level of habitual physical activity were enrolled.  action was measured with a four-phase hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (basal and 10, 16, and 80 mU//min) with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers.Adolescents with T1D had a significantly higher rate of lipolysis (P < 0.0001) and endogenous glucose production (P < 0.001) and lower peripheral glucose uptake (glucose rate of disappearance, 6.9 ± 2.9 mg/kg/min for patients with T1D vs 11.3 ± 3.3 for controls; P < 0.0001) during hyperinsulinemia compared with controls. In youth with T1D, glucose rate of disappearance correlated with free fatty acid at the 80-mU//min phase (P = 0.005), markers of inflammation (IL-6; P = 0.012), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (P = 0.001), and leptin (P = 0.008)], but not hemoglobin A1c.Adolescents with T1D have adipose, hepatic and peripheral IR.

The cognitive-behavioral group is a depression prevention program involving psycho-education, restructuring negative thoughts, and behavioral activation. The health education group is a didactic control that provides knowledge about healthy living. Participants are assessed at baseline, immediate post-intervention, and one-year follow-up. Primary outcomes are  sensitivity and β-cell function from oral glucose tolerance tests. Secondary outcomes are disinhibited eating, physical activity, sleep, and cortisol.Results from this adequately powered randomized controlled trial will determine whether decreasing depressive symptoms with a behavioral health program preventatively alters  sensitivity and β-cell function trajectories in adolescents at-risk for T2D.

Ectonucleotide Pyrophosphatase/Phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) gene is one of the candidate genes which have primary importance in T2DM development. Several studies revealed the association between ENPP1 polymorphisms, including rs997509, and T2DM, obesity,  and metabolic syndrome in different populations. The aim: To test the association between ENPP1 rs997509 polymorphism and T2DM development in patients with different risk factors in the Ukrainian population.Materials and methods: Venous blood of 317 unrelated T2DM patients and 302 healthy volunteers was used for analysis. ENPP1 rs997509 genotyping was performed using PCR-RFLP (polymerase chain reaction with following restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis) method.Results: Our results revealed that ratio of C/C homozygotes, C/T heterozygotes and T/T homozygotes between case and control groups was significantly different (89.0 % , 11.0%, 0 % vs 94.4 %, 5.6 %, 0 %, P = 0.015).

Although sarcopenia has multifactorial causes, it might be partly attributed to a blunted response to anabolic stimuli. Leucine acutely increases muscle protein synthesis, and  training (RT) is the strongest stimuli to counteract sarcopenia and was recently shown to improve  sensitivity (IS) in frail older women. Discrepancies exist regarding whether chronic supplementation of leucine in conjunction with RT can improve muscle mass and IS.The aim of this double-blinded placebo-controlled study was to determine the effects of leucine supplementation and RT on IS in prefrail and frail older women.Using the Fried criteria, 19 nondiabetic prefrail (1-2 criteria) and frail (≥3 criteria) older women (77.5 ± 1.3 y; body mass index (kg/): 25.1 ± 0.9) underwent a 3-mo intervention of RT 3 times/wk with protein-optimized diet of 1.2 g·kg-1·d-1 and 7.5 g·d-1 of l-leucine supplementation compared with placebo l-alanine. Pre-/postintervention primary outcomes were fasting plasma glucose, serum , and 4-h responses to a standard meal of complete liquid formula. Secondary outcomes of resting energy expenditure using indirect calorimetry and body composition using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were obtained. Paired t tests analyzed pooled data, and 2-factor repeated-measures ANOVA determined supplementation, training, and interaction effects.No significant time, group, or interaction effects were observed for postprandial areas under the curve of serum  or plasma glucose or for resting energy expenditure in l-leucine compared with l-alanine. Total lean body mass increased and percentage body fat decreased significantly for both groups postintervention (0.76 ± 0.13 and -0.92 ± 0.33 kg, respectively; time effect: P < 0.01).IS was not affected by RT and leucine supplementation in nondiabetic prefrail and frail older women.

However, the contribution of HI mediated ATI and its metabolic consequences are yet to be explored. We induced chronic HI per se in mice by administration of exogenous  for 8 weeks through mini-osmotic pumps. For the reduction of circulating  in response to excess calorie intake, we have partially ablated β-cells by using streptozotocin (STZ) in the diet-induced obesity (DIO) and genetic mice models (db/db). Flow cytometry analysis was performed for the quantification of immune cells in stromal vascular fraction (SVF) isolated from epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT). Our studies demonstrated that chronic HI augmented ATI in terms of elevated pro-inflammatory cells (M1 macrophages and NK-cells) and suppressed anti-inflammatory cells ( macrophages, eosinophils and regulatory T-cells). These results were correlated with altered obesity-associated metabolic phenotype. Partial reduction of circulating  level attenuated excess calorie-induced ATI and improved  sensitivity. Mechanistically, an imbalance in M1 and  macrophage proportions in eWAT promoted iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase): arginase-1 imbalance that resulted into extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and  (IR) development. However, iNOS mice were protected from HI-induced M1: macrophage imbalance, ECM deposition and IR in adipose tissue. Overall, we conclude that chronic HI per se contributed in ATI and iNOS corroborated ECM deposition.Copyright © 2018.

Small observational studies suggested that high circulating chemerin levels are also related to bone erosion. We aimed to determine whether plasma chemerin levels are related to bone quality in the general population and to investigate the influence of body mass index (BMI) on that relation. For our analyses, we obtained data from 3583 adults who participated in the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania-Trend. The participants were divided into three groups according to their BMI: lean (<25 kg/), overweight (25 to 30 kg/), and obese (≥30 kg/). Chemerin concentrations were determined in EDTA plasma. Bone quality was assessed using quantitative ultrasound at the heel. Broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), speed of sound (SOS), stiffness index, and osteoporotic fracture risk were derived from this measurement. Sex- and BMI-specific linear regression models revealed inverse associations between chemerin levels and BUA in obese men. In obese women, inverse relations between chemerin levels and SOS or stiffness index were found. Logistic regression models revealed positive associations between chemerin levels and osteoporotic fracture risk. In lean or overweight subjects, no statistically significant associations were found. Our sex- and BMI-specific analyses showed that inverse associations between chemerin levels and bone quality are restricted to obese men and women.

The role of miRNAs in inflammation associated with IR is poorly understood.To investigate miR-181a-5p and miR-23a-3p expression profiles in obesity and to study their role in TNFα-induced IR in adipocytes.Two separate cohorts were used. Cohort 1 was used in adipose tissue (AT) expression studies and included 28 subjects with body mass index (BMI) <30 kg/ and 30 with BMI ≥30 kg/. Cohort 2 was used in circulating serum miRNA studies and included 101 subjects with 4 years of follow-up (48 case subjects and 53 control subjects). miR-181a-5p and miR-23a-3p expression was assessed in subcutaneous and visceral AT. Functional analysis was performed in adipocytes, using miRNA mimics and inhibitors. Key molecules of the  pathway, AKT, PTEN, AS160, and S6K, were analyzed.Expression of miR-181a-5p and miR-23a-3p was reduced in adipose tissue from obese and diabetic subjects and was inversely correlated to adiposity and homeostasis model assessment of IR index. Overexpression of miR-181a-5p and miR-23a-3p in adipocytes upregulated -stimulated AKT activation and reduced TNFα-induced IR, regulating PTEN and S6K expression. Serum levels of miR-181a-5p were reduced in case vs control subjects at baseline, suggesting a prognostic value. Variable importance in projection scores revealed miR-181a-5p had more effect on the model than  or glucose at 120 minutes.miR-181a-5p and miR-23a-3p may prevent TNFα-induced IR in adipocytes through modulation of PTEN and S6K expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29556093>Hypertension with diabetes mellitus: physiology and pathology.</a></h2><p>Elevated blood pressure is closely related to increased circulatory fluid volume and peripheral vascular .

The present study aimed to compare the effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and usual dietary advice (UDA) on PPAR-γ gene expression in women at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).This randomized controlled trial was performed on 44 women aged 20-50 years at risk for CVD (BMI > 25 kg/ and low physical activity). Participants were randomly assigned to the UDA (n = 22) or DASH (n = 22) diets for 12 weeks. The DASH diet was rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy products and low in saturated fat, total fat, cholesterol, refined grains and sweets, with a total of 2400 mg/day sodium. The UDA diet was a regular diet with healthy dietary advice. Anthropometric indices and PPAR-γ gene expression were measured and compared between the two groups at the end of the study.After the intervention, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) significantly decreased in the DASH group (P < 0.050) but the results showed no significant differences between the two groups. At the end of the trial, PPAR-γ gene expression was significantly different between the UDA and the DASH diet groups (P = 0.040) and this difference remained significant after adjustment for BMI, and physical activity (P = 0.030).The result of the study showed that the DASH diet significantly decreased the expression of PPAR-γ.

Interleukin-29 (IL-29), a member of type 3 interferon family, plays a role in host defenses against microbes, however, little is known about its role in metabolic disorders. We explored the function of IL-29 in the pathogenesis of obesity-induced inflammation and . We found that serum IL-29 level was significantly higher in obese patients. IL-29 upregulated IL-1β, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression and decreased glucose uptake and  sensitivity in human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes through reducing glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and AKT signals. In addition, IL-29 promoted monocyte/macrophage migration. Inhibition of IL-29 could reduce inflammatory cytokine production in macrophage-adipocyte coculture system, which mimic an obese microenvironment. In vivo, IL-29 reduced  sensitivity and increased the number of peritoneal macrophages in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. IL-29 increased M1/ macrophage ratio and enhanced MCP-1 expression in adipose tissues of HFD mice. Therefore, we have identified a critical role of IL-29 in obesity-induced inflammation and , and we conclude that IL-29 may be a novel candidate target for treating obesity and  in patients with metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30145227>Glucocorticoid-induced  is related to macrophage visceral adipose tissue infiltration.</a></h2><p> is frequently present in patients with glucocorticoid (GC) excess (Cushing's syndrome) or treated with high doses of GCs. Furthermore, others similarities between metabolic syndrome (visceral obesity, elevated blood glucose levels, dyslipidemia) and Cushing's syndrome suggest that GCs could play a role in obesity-linked complications. Here we reported that long-term corticosterone (CORT) exposure in mice induced weight gain, dyslipidemia as well as hyperglycaemia and systemic . CORT-treated mice exhibited an increased 11β-Hsd1 expression and corticosterone levels in fat depots but a specific upregulation of glucocorticoid receptor (Gr) and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase only in gonadal adipose tissue, suggesting that GC could act differentially on various fat depots. Despite fat accumulation in all depots, an increased expression of adipogenic (Pparγ, C/ebpα) and lipogenic (Acc, Fas) key genes was restricted to gonadal adipose tissue. Hypertrophied adipocytes observed in both visceral and subcutaneous depots also resulted from reduced lipolytic activity due to CORT treatment. Surprisingly, GC treatment promoted macrophage infiltration (F4/80, Cd68) within all adipose tissues along with predominant -like macrophage phenotype, and can directly act on macrophages to induce this phenotype. Moreover, macrophage infiltration preceded mass gain and adipocyte hypertrophy. Of note, specific macrophage depletion in gonadal fat preferentially reduced the -like macrophage content, and partially restored  sensitivity in mice with GC-induced obesity and . These data provide evidence that GCs act on adipose tissue in a depot-dependent manner and that gonadal adipose macrophages are key effectors of GC-associated .Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Over 50% of the interstitial cells in adipose tissue are macrophages, which produce inflammatory cytokines and therefore play an important role in the progression of . Within this classification view, macrophage biology is driven by two polarization phenotypes, M (proinflammatory) and M (anti-inflammatory). The unique functional receptor of ghrelin, growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), is a classic seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor that is linked to multiple intracellular signaling pathways. Knockout of GHSR improves the obesity and glucose metabolic disorders, suggesting a crucial role of ghrelin activity in . Here, we discussed whether macrophage polarization phenotypes in adipose tissue were changed in GHSR knockout (GHSR-/-) mice.GHSR-/- mice were fed with normal chow diet (NCD) or high fat diet (HFD). Markers of different macrophage polarization phenotypes were detected by real-time RT-PCR.The size of adipocytes decreased and interstitial cells, especially infiltrated macrophages, reduced in epididymal adipose tissue of GHSR-/- mice fed with HFD. Compared with wild type mice, the mRNA levels of inflammatory adipokines such as resistin, IL-6, and PAI-1 were significantly lower in epididymal adipose tissue of GHSR-/- mice, whereas anti-inflammatory adipokine, adiponectin, was significantly higher. M markers, MCP-1, TNF-, and iNOS, were significantly lower in epididymal adipose tissue of GHSR-/- mice, whereas M markers, Arg-1, Mgl-1, were Mrc1, were significantly higher.The GHSR-/- mice fed with HFD showed suppressed adipose inflammation, reduced macrophage infiltration, and enhanced M polarization of macrophages in adipose tissue, which improved  sensitivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31178714>Identification of Temporal Characteristic Networks of Peripheral Blood Changes in Alzheimer's Disease Based on Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. The study of blood-based biomarkers has lasted for a long time in AD, because it supports the concept that peripheral changes are involved in AD pathology. But it is still unclear how peripheral blood is involved in the temporal characteristic molecular mechanisms of AD from aging to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and which cells are responsible for the molecular mechanisms. The main purpose of our study is to gain a systematic and comprehensive understanding of temporal characteristic networks of peripheral blood in AD using whole blood samples with 329 case-control samples, including 104 normal elderly control subjects (CTL), 80 MCI who are susceptible to AD, and 145 AD, by the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The module-trait relationships were constructed and module preservation was validated with independent datasets GSE63061, GSE97760, GSE18309, GSE29378, GSE28146, and GSE29652. Our results indicate that the down-regulated protein modification and ubiquitin degradation systems, and the up-regulated  both play a major role in MCI, while the up-regulated inflammatory cascade dominates in AD, which is mainly mediated by monocytes, macrophages. Although there is mixed activation of M1 and  macrophages in all stages of AD, the immune neutral state or  polarization may predominate in MCI, and M1 polarization may predominate in AD. Moreover, we found that TRPV2, NDUFV1, ATF4, HSPA8, STAT3 and LUC7L3 may mediate the pathological changes in MCI, while SIRPA, LAMP-2, NDUFB5, HSPA8, STAT3 and FPR2 may mediate the conversion from MCI-AD or the pathological changes in AD, which provide a basis for the treatment based on the peripheral blood system. In addition, we also found that the combined diagnosis based on a panel of genes from the red, blue, and brown modules have a moderate diagnostic effect on distinguishing MCI and AD from CTL, suggesting that those panels of genes may be used for detection of MCI and prediction of this conversion from MCI to AD. Our research emphasizes that pathological changes, based on temporal characteristics of peripheral blood, provide a theoretical basis for targeted peripheral treatment based on appropriate times and identified several diagnostic markers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29866650>NFATc3 Deficiency Reduces the Classical Activation of Adipose Tissue Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Nuclear factors of activated T-cells (NFAT) c3 has a prominent role in regulation of proinflammatory factors in immune cells.

We set out to determine how deficiency of NFATc3 effected macrophage polarization, inflammation and  in visceral adipose tissue of high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Nfatc3-/- and wild type (WT) mice were fed a HFD for 8 to 17 weeks. Epididymal white AT (eWAT) F4/80(+) cells were characterized by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and quantitative RT-PCR. Results showed that Nfatc3-/- mice developed HFD-induced obesity similar to WT mice, but  sensitivity and glucose tolerance were improved, and liver fat accumulation was reduced in Nfatc3-/- mice compared to WT control mice. Moreover, M1 macrophage content and proinflammatory factors were reduced whereas the alternatively activated  macrophage content was increased in eWAT of HFD-fed Nfatc3-/- mice compared to that of WT mice. In addition, eWAT  signaling was improved in HFD-fed Nfatc3-/- mice. Importantly, after bone-marrow-derived macrophages had been isolated from Nfatc3-/- mice and cultured in vitro, treatment of these cells with interferon-γ and lipopolysaccharide resulted in reduction of M1 inflammatory markers, suggesting that NFATc3 promoted M1 polarization by a cell-autonomous mechanism. The results demonstrated that NFATc3 played an important role in M1 macrophage polarization, adipose tissue inflammation and  in response to obesity through transcriptional activation of proinflammatory genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600295>Association of Parity in Patients with Chronic Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>The impact of type of liver disease on parity rates hasn't been described. Our aim was to assess the parity rates among women with CLD.The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey-III (1988-1994) data were used to identify adult female participants with a diagnosis of CLD. Participants were asked about their reproductive health status. Parity was defined as having at least one live birth. Hepatic ultrasound, serologic, medical examination and clinical data were available to determine the presence and type of CLD. Body mass index (kg/) was divided into 3 categories (&lt; 30; 30-35; 36+).A total of 3,502 (865 NAFLD, 737 other CLD, 1,901 control) subjects were included. Patients with NAFLD were more likely to have at least one live birth than patients with other CLD and controls (77% in NAFLD vs. 72% in controls). Multivariate analysis revealed that presence of CLD other than NAFLD (OR: 0.46 [95% CI, 0.34-0.63]) and having a college or higher degree (OR: 0.48 [95% CI, 0.34-0.68]) were negatively associated while having low income (OR: 11.06 [95% CI, 6.86-17.82]) and being African American (OR: 3.93 [95% CI, 2.59-5.98]) were positively associated with having at least one live birth.This study revealed that patients with CLD other than NAFLD were less likely to have at least one live birth. NAFLD and obesity were associated with higher rates of live births which can potentially be explained by weight gain post live birth leading to obesity and its associated-NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29378051>Short-Term Overfeeding with Dairy Cream Does Not Modify Gut Permeability, the Fecal Microbiota, or Glucose Metabolism in Young Healthy Men.</a></h2><p>High-fat diets (HFDs) have been linked to low-grade inflammation and .The main purpose of the present study was to assess whether acute overfeeding with an HFD affects  sensitivity, gut barrier function, and fecal microbiota in humans.In a prospective intervention study, 24 healthy men [mean ± SD: age 23.0 ± 2.8 y, body mass index (in kg/) 23.0 ± 2.1] received an HFD (48% of energy from fat) with an additional 1000 kcal/d (as whipping cream) above their calculated energy expenditure for 7 d.  sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp), gut permeability (sugar and polyethylene glycol absorption tests, plasma zonulin), and gut microbiota profiles (high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing) were assessed before and after overfeeding, and 14 d after intervention. Additionally, inflammation markers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, leptin, high-molecular-weight adiponectin, calprotectin, regulated on activation normal, T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were measured in plasma by ELISA. Finally, lipid parameters were analyzed in serum by a laboratory service.Although participants gained 0.9 ± 0.6 kg (P < 0.001) body weight, overnutrition was not associated with a significant change in  sensitivity (M value and glucose disposal). Overfeeding for 7 d resulted in elevated serum total (10.2%), LDL (14.6%) and HDL (14.8%) cholesterol concentrations (P < 0.01). In contrast, fasting plasma triglyceride significantly declined (29.3%) during overfeeding (P < 0.001). In addition, there were no significant changes in inflammatory markers. Urine excretion of 4 sugars and polyethylene glycol, used as a proxy for gut permeability, and plasma concentration of zonulin, a marker of paracellular gut permeability, were unchanged. Moreover, overfeeding was not associated with consistent changes in gut microbiota profiles, but marked alterations were observed in a subgroup of 6 individuals.Our findings suggest that short-term overfeeding with an HFD does not significantly impair  sensitivity and gut permeability in normal-weight healthy men, and that changes in dominant communities of fecal bacteria occur only in certain individuals.

We investigated the association of kidney function with gait pattern in the general population and tested whether the association between impaired kidney function and fall is more pronounced in subjects with lower gait function.We included 1430 participants (mean age: 60 years) from the Rotterdam Study. Kidney function was assessed using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). We assessed global gait, gait velocity and seven independent gait domains: Rhythm, Phases, Variability, Pace, Tandem, Turning and Base of Support. Regression models adjusted for cardiometabolic and neurological factors were used. We evaluated whether participants with impaired kidney function and impaired gait fell more in the previous year.The study population had a median (interquartile range) ACR of 3.6 (2.5-6.2) mg/g and mean ± SD eGFR of 87.6 ± 15 mL/min/1.73 . Higher ACR and lower eGFR were associated with lower global gait score [per doubling of ACR: -0.10, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.14 to -0.06, and per SD eGFR:-0.09, 95% CI: -0.14 to -0.03] and slower gait speed (ACR: -1.44 cm/s, CI: -2.12 to -0.76; eGFR: -1.55 cm/s, CI: -2.43 to -0.67).

The aim of the current study was to investigate the ability of ANGPTL8 to reverse  in obese mice. The administration of ANGPTL8 reduced weight gain and improved glucose tolerance in mice with diet-induced obesity. In addition, ANGPTL8 administration modified macrophage infiltration, reduced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-1β(IL-1β) levels, and increased adiponectin gene expression in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT).

The median body mass index was 42.5 (40.0 - 46.8) kg/ and 52.1% had metabolic syndrome. Iron deficiency was present in 7.0%, with no differences between genders or between patients with or without metabolic syndrome. Hypertension was associated with lower prevalence of iron deficiency. Type 2 diabetes and hypertension patients had higher levels of ferritin. The multivariate analysis showed that metabolic syndrome and increasing body mass index were predictive of higher risk of iron deficiency while hypertension predicted lower odds of iron deficiency.The prevalence of iron deficiency was similar in other published studies. Iron deficiency may be underdiagnosed if based only on ferritin concentrations. In our study, diabetes and hypertension appear to contribute to the increase in ferritin levels described in obesity.Ferritin may not be a reliable index for evaluating iron stores in obese patients, particularly when associated with comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.

We examined coffee intake in relation to the metabolic syndrome using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2012-2015, with 8387 adults aged 19-64 years. Furthermore, we conducted a stratified analysis by obesity status (BMI <25 v. ≥25 kg/) to examine whether the association varied by obesity status. A 112-item FFQ was used to assess diet. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the association of coffee consumption (<1, 1-2, 3-4 and ≥5 times/d) and the metabolic syndrome. Compared to people who consumed <1 time/d of coffee, the OR for the metabolic syndrome in those who consumed 3-4 times/d of coffee was 0·75 (95 % CI 0·58, 0·97). However, ≥5 times/d of coffee consumption was not significantly associated with the metabolic syndrome. By obesity status, in non-obese people, those consuming more coffee had lower odds of the metabolic syndrome, showing a significant linear trend (P-trend=0·0248). In obese people, the OR for the metabolic syndrome in people with 3-4 times/d of coffee consumption v. <1 time/d was 0·68 (95 % CI 0·50, 0·93), but ≥5 times/d of coffee consumption showed a non-significant positive association.

In the current study, we tested whether consumption of luteolin, an anti-inflammatory flavonoid, could mitigate adipose tissue inflammation and  in obese ovariectomized mice. Nine-week-old ovariectomized C57BL/6 mice were fed a low-fat diet, high-fat diet (HFD) or HFD supplemented with 0.005% luteolin (HFD+L) for 16 weeks. Results showed no difference in body weight or fat mass between mice fed HFD+L and those fed HFD. However, luteolin supplementation resulted in lower CD11c macrophages in gonadal adipose tissue, as well as a trend toward lower macrophage infiltration. Luteolin supplementation also significantly lowered mRNA expression of inflammatory and M1 markers MCP-1, CD11c, TNF-α and IL-6, while maintaining expression of  marker MGL1. Consistent with this, the in vitro luteolin treatment, with or without the presence of estrogen, inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced polarization of RAW 264.7 cells toward M1 phenotype. We further found that luteolin supplementation protected mice from  induced by HFD consumption; this improved  was correlated with reductions in CD11c adipose tissue macrophages. Taken together, these findings indicate that dietary luteolin supplementation attenuates adipose tissue inflammation and  found in mice with loss of ovarian function coupled with an HFD intake, and this effect may be partly mediated through suppressing M1-like polarization of macrophages in adipose tissue.

Associations between age at menarche and cardiovascular risk factors, and being in a high-risk metabolic cluster at 17 and 20 years, or having the metabolic syndrome at 20 years, were investigated by linear mixed effects and logistic regressions, respectively.Each year later of onset of menarche was associated with a 0.75 kg/ reduction in BMI (coefficient -0.75 [95%CI -1.06, -0.44]), and an approximate 30% reduction in the odds of being in the high-risk metabolic cluster at 17 years (OR = 0.73 [95%CI 0.57, 0.94]) and 20 years of age (OR = 0.68 [95%CI 0.52, 0.87]), and a 40% reduction in the odds of having the metabolic syndrome at 20 years (OR = 0.60 [95% CI 0.41, 0.88]). These data show earlier age at menarche was associated with increased BMI and odds of being in the high-risk metabolic cluster at 17 and 20 years, and increased odds of having the metabolic syndrome at 20 years. However, these associations were no longer statistically significant after adjustment for BMI at age 8 years. Current smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, socio-economic status, or hormonal contraceptives use did not affect these associations.Earlier age at menarche may be indicative of a higher risk profile for CVD in young adulthood.

Epidemiological evidence indicates that consumption of white rice is positively associated with T2D risk, while intake of brown rice is inversely associated. Thus, we explored the effect of substituting brown rice for white rice on T2D risk factors among adults in urban South India. A total of 166 overweight (BMI ≥ 23 kg/) adults aged 25-65 years were enrolled in a randomised cross-over trial in Chennai, India. Interventions were a parboiled brown rice or white rice regimen providing two ad libitum meals/d, 6 d/week for 3 months with a 2-week washout period. Primary outcomes were blood glucose, , glycosylated Hb (HbA1c),  (homeostasis model assessment of ) and lipids. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was a secondary outcome. We did not observe significant between-group differences for primary outcomes among all participants. However, a significant reduction in HbA1c was observed in the brown rice group among participants with the metabolic syndrome (-0·18 (se 0·08) %) relative to those without the metabolic syndrome (0·05 (se 0·05) %) (P-for-heterogeneity = 0·02). Improvements in HbA1c, total and LDL-cholesterol were observed in the brown rice group among participants with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/ compared with those with a BMI &lt; 25 kg/ (P-for-heterogeneity &lt; 0·05). We observed a smaller increase in hs-CRP in the brown (0·03 (sd 2·12) mg/l) compared with white rice group (0·63 (sd 2·35) mg/l) (P = 0·04). In conclusion, substituting brown rice for white rice showed a potential benefit on HbA1c among participants with the metabolic syndrome and an elevated BMI. A small benefit on inflammation was also observed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415655>The efficacy and safety of concentrated herbal extract granules, YH1, as an add-on medication in poorly controlled type 2 diabetes: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial.</a></h2><p>In Asian countries, many patients with type 2 diabetes fail to achieve controlled glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels while taking several classes of oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs). Traditional Chinese medicine could be an alternative therapeutic option for poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. YH1 is a concentrated Chinese herbal extract formula that combines Rhizoma Coptidis and Shen-Ling-Bai-Zhu-San. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study evaluated YH1 as an add-on medication for poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.Forty-six patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned 1:1 to the YH1 or placebo group. Before the trial, all subjects had received three or more classes of OHAs with HbA1c > 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and a body mass index ≥ 23 kg/. During the 12-week trial, participants continued to take OHAs without any dose or medication changes. The primary endpoint was the percentage change in HbA1c level. Per-protocol analysis was applied to the final evaluation.At week 12, there was an 11.1% reduction in HbA1c from baseline and a 68.9% increase in homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) of β cell function in the YH1 group, which also exhibited significant reductions in two-hour postprandial glucose (-26.2%), triglycerides (-29.5%), total cholesterol (-21.6%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-17.4%), body weight (-0.5%), and waist circumference (-1.1%). The changes in fasting plasma glucose, HOMA  and symptom scores were not significantly different between the YH1 and placebo groups. No serious adverse events occurred during this clinical trial.This pilot study indicates that YH1 together with OHAs can improve hypoglycemic action and β-cell function in overweight/obese patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. YH1 is a safe add-on medication for OHAs and has beneficial effects on weight control and lipid metabolism. A larger study population with longer treatment and follow-up periods is required for further verification.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30690082>Exercise training prevents high-fat diet-induced adipose tissue remodeling by promoting capillary density and macrophage polarization.</a></h2><p>Increasing adipose tissue capillarization is beneficial to metabolic health. The present study examined the effects of continuous training (CT) and aerobic-interval training (AIT) coinciding with a high-fat diet (HFD) on capillary density, macrophage polarization in mesenteric (mAT) and subcutaneous (sAT) adipose tissue.48 male Wistar rats were divided into HFD and normal diet (ND) groups. After 10 weeks, each group was divided into sedentary, CT, and AIT. The animals in training groups performed 10-week matched distances of CT and AIT on a motorized treadmill (5 times/week).The results showed that HFD significantly reduced the capillary density of adipose tissue (sAT: 54% vs. mAT:49%) and increased systemic , mean adipocyte size, crown-like structure (CLs), and M1-macrophages with no change in the total number of adipocytes in either tissue. Exercise training reversed the HFD induced adipose tissue dysfunction. Compared to CT, AIT was more effective on increasing the capillary density of sAT (170 vs. 87%) and mAT (140 vs. 100%). Likewise, AIT increased the capillary density of both tissues even in comparison to the ND sedentary group (~25%). Compared with CT as well, AIT more significantly increased the number of  macrophages (181 vs. 122%) and decreased CLs (60 vs. 38%) in mAT.The findings suggest that hypertrophy is a major contributor to adipose tissue expansion in obesity. Furthermore, exercise training largely demonstrated beneficial effects on adipose tissue remodeling, where AIT is more effective than CT in reducing HFD-induced adipose tissue dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The aim is to evaluate gonadal dysfunction and the effects of weight loss after gastric banding in obese adolescent boys. Methods Thirty-seven of 54 boys (age 16.2±1.2 years, mean BMI 48.2 kg/) enrolled at the Center for Adolescent Bariatric Surgery at Columbia University Medical Center had low total testosterone for Tanner 5 <350 ng/dL. Sixteen had long-term hormonal data for analysis at baseline (T0), 1 year (T1) and 2 years (T2) post-surgery. T-tests, chi-squared (χ2) tests, correlation and linear mixed models were performed. Results At T0, the hypogonadal group had higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) (75th vs. 57th percentile, p=0.02), fasting  (19 vs. 9 μIU/mL, p=0.0008) and homeostatic index of  (HOMA-IR) (4.2 vs. 1.9, p=0.009) compared to control group. Total testosterone was negatively correlated with fasting  and HOMA-IR. In the long-term analysis, BMI, weight, waist circumference (WC), and % excess weight decreased at T1 and T2 compared to T0. Mean total testosterone at T0, T1 and T2 were 268, 304 and 368 ng/dL, respectively (p=0.07). There was a statistically significant negative correlation between BMI and testosterone after 2 years (r=-0.81, p=0.003). Conclusions Low testosterone levels but unaltered gonadotropins are common in this group and associated with . While a significant increase in testosterone was not found over time, the negative relationship between BMI and testosterone persisted, suggesting there may be an optimal threshold for testosterone production with respect to BMI.

This study aimed to investigate the association between indices of diabetes and the incidence of hypertension and compare the predictive powers of these indices in middle-aged Japanese.This 5-year cohort study included 2210 Japanese aged 30-64 years without hypertension. Hazard ratios of high fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels, high post-loaded BG levels, high glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels,  (defined by homeostasis model assessment of  [HOMA-IR]) and impaired  secretion at baseline for the incidence of hypertension were estimated using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg or receiving antihypertensive treatment.During the follow-up, 456 participants developed hypertension. After adjustment for HbA1c and HOMA-IR, FBG was independently and significantly associated with hypertension. The hazard ratio of participants with FBG ≥7.0 mmol/l was 1.79 compared with those with FBG <5.6 mmol/l. Even among those with HbA1c <6.5%, HOMA-IR <2.5, body mass index <25 kg/, age <55 years old, blood pressure <130/80 mmHg or non- and moderate drinking, the results were similar. High 120-min BG level and impaired  secretion did not increase the risk for hypertension.FBG was a predictable index for future incidence of hypertension in middle-aged Japanese men and women.

Participants and study personnel performing laboratory analyses were blinded to each condition.The KE increased d-β-hydroxybutyrate to a maximum of ∼3.4 mM (P < 0.001) during the OGTT. Compared with the control drink, KE reduced glucose (-11%, P = 0.002), NEFA (-21%, P = 0.009), and glucagon-like peptide 1 (-31%, P = 0.001) areas under the curve (AUCs), whereas glucagon AUC increased (+11%, P = 0.030). No differences in triglyceride, C-peptide, and  AUCs were observed after the KE drink. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased and heart rate increased after the KE drink (both P < 0.01).A KE drink consumed before an OGTT lowered glucose and NEFA AUCs with no increase in circulating .

Under lean conditions, immune cells predominantly of type 2 immunity, including eosinophils, -like anti-inflammatory macrophages and innate lymphoid cells 2, contribute to the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis within the AT. In the course of obesity, pro-inflammatory immune cells, such as M1-like macrophages, prevail in the AT. Inflammation in the obese AT is associated with the development of metabolic complications such as , type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Thus, the immune cell-adipocyte crosstalk in the AT is an important regulator of AT function and systemic metabolism. We discuss herein this crosstalk with a special focus on the role of innate immune cells in AT inflammation and metabolic homeostasis in obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30020463>Differences in Upper and Lower Body Adipose Tissue Oxygen Tension Contribute to the Adipose Tissue Phenotype in Humans.</a></h2><p>Upper and lower body adipose tissue (AT) exhibits opposing associations with obesity-related cardiometabolic diseases. Recent studies have suggested that altered AT oxygen tension (pO2) may contribute to AT dysfunction. Here, we compared in vivo abdominal (ABD) and femoral (FEM) subcutaneous AT pO2 in women who are overweight and have obesity, and investigated the effects of physiological AT pO2 on human adipocyte function.ABD and FEM subcutaneous AT pO2 and AT blood flow (ATBF) were assessed in eight [BMI (body mass index) 34.4 ± 1.6 kg/] postmenopausal women who were overweight with obesity and impaired glucose metabolism. ABD and FEM AT biopsy specimens were collected to determine adipocyte morphology and AT gene expression. Moreover, the effects of prolonged exposure (14 days) to physiological AT pO2 on adipokine expression/secretion, mitochondrial respiration, and glucose uptake were investigated in differentiated human multipotent adipose-derived stem cells.AT pO2 was higher in ABD than FEM AT (62.7 ± 6.6 vs 50.0 ± 4.5 mm Hg, P = 0.013), whereas ATBF was comparable between depots. Maximal uncoupled oxygen consumption rates were substantially lower in ABD than FEM adipocytes for all pO2 conditions. Low physiological pO2 (5% O2) decreased proinflammatory gene expression, increased basal glucose uptake, and altered adipokine secretion in ABD and FEM adipocytes.We demonstrated for the first time, to our knowledge, that AT pO2 is higher in ABD than FEM subcutaneous AT in women who are overweight/with obesity, partly due to a lower oxygen consumption rate in ABD adipocytes. Moreover, low physiological pO2 decreased proinflammatory gene expression and improved the metabolic phenotype in differentiated human adipocytes, whereas more heterogeneous effects on adipokine secretion were found.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719456>Human Visceral Adipose Tissue Macrophages Are Not Adequately Defined by Standard Methods of Characterization.</a></h2><p>Obesity is associated with a state of chronic low-grade inflammation both systemically and within specific tissues, including adipose tissue (AT). In murine models of obesity, there is a shift in the inflammatory profile of the AT immune cells, with an accumulation of proinflammatory M1 macrophages that surround the expanding adipocyte. However, much less is known about the immune cell composition and how to best define AT macrophages in humans. . The goals of the current study were to determine the contribution of macrophages to the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) in lean versus obese human visceral AT (VAT); examine the expression of common M1, , and pan macrophage markers; and determine the association of specific macrophage types with known biomarkers of obesity-related cardiometabolic disease. . VAT biopsies were obtained from obese ( = 50) and lean ( = 8) patients during elective surgery. Adipocytes and SVF were isolated, and the SVF was subjected to flow cytometry analyses. . Our results indicate that VAT macrophages are increased in obesity and associate with biomarkers of CVD but that many macrophages do not fall into currently defined M1/ classification system based on CD206 receptor expression levels. . VAT macrophages are increased in obese subjects, but the current markers used to define macrophage populations are inadequate to distinguish differences in human obesity.

Despite its increased global incidence, very few promising treatments for NASH are available. Pirfenidone is an antifibrotic agent used to treat pulmonary fibrosis; it suppresses the pulmonary influx of T cells and macrophages. Here, we investigated the effect of pirfenidone in a mouse model of lipotoxicity-induced NASH via a high-cholesterol and high-fat diet. After 12 weeks of feeding, pirfenidone administration attenuated excessive hepatic lipid accumulation and peroxidation by reducing the expression of genes related to lipogenesis and fatty acid synthesis and enhancing the expression of those related to fatty acid oxidation. Flow cytometry indicated that pirfenidone reduced the number of total hepatic macrophages, particularly CD11cCD206(M1)-type macrophages, increased the number of CD11cCD206()-type macrophages, and subsequently reduced T-cell numbers, which helped improve  and steatohepatitis. Moreover, pirfenidone downregulated the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mRNA expression of M1 marker genes and upregulated IL-4-induced  marker genes in a dose-dependent manner in RAW264.7 macrophages.

Androgen bioactivity was measured in maternal serum during the third trimester using a receptor-mediated luciferase expression bioassay. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) using Adult Treatment Panel III criteria was assessed in adult offspring. Bioactive androgens were analyzed as quartiles, with the lowest quartile (Q1) defined as the reference. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate the relationship of maternal bioactive androgens on offspring MetS risk overall and by sex, controlling for potential confounders and intrafamilial correlation.Mean age and body mass index of adult offspring were 44.7 ± 2.6 years and 29.7 ± 6.7 kg/, respectively. Participants born to mothers with the highest quartile (Q4) compared with Q1 of bioactive androgens had higher risk for MetS [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.53(1.07 to 6.02)].

Women born to mothers with the highest levels of maternal bioactive androgens also demonstrated a 4.84-fold increased odds for having hypertension [Q4 vs Q1; aOR: 4.84 (1.12 to 20.85)].Higher levels of maternal androgens were associated with increased risk for incident MetS in adult offspring, an effect that was significant in women but not men.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30667374>Adipocyte-secreted exosomal microRNA-34a inhibits  macrophage polarization to promote obesity-induced adipose inflammation.</a></h2><p>Persistent, unresolved inflammation in adipose tissue is a major contributor to obesity-associated metabolic complications. However, the molecular links between lipid-overloaded adipocytes and inflammatory immune cells in obese adipose tissues remain elusive. Here we identified adipocyte-secreted microRNA-34a (miR-34a) as a key mediator through its paracrine actions on adipose-resident macrophages. The expression of miR-34a in adipose tissues was progressively increased with the development of dietary obesity. Adipose-selective or adipocyte-specific miR-34a-KO mice were resistant to obesity-induced glucose intolerance, , and systemic inflammation, and this was accompanied by a significant shift in polarization of adipose-resident macrophages from proinflammatory M1 to antiinflammatory  phenotype. Mechanistically, mature adipocyte-secreted exosomes transported miR-34a into macrophages, thereby suppressing  polarization by repressing the expression of Krüppel-like factor 4 (Klf4). The suppressive effects of miR-34a on  polarization and its stimulation of inflammatory responses were reversed by ectopic expression of Klf4 in both bone marrow-derived macrophages and adipose depots of obese mice. Furthermore, increased miR-34a expression in visceral fat of overweight/obese subjects correlated negatively with reduced Klf4 expression, but positively with the parameters of  and metabolic inflammation. In summary, miR-34a was a key component of adipocyte-secreted exosomal vesicles that transmitted the signal of nutrient overload to the adipose-resident macrophages for exacerbation of obesity-induced systemic inflammation and metabolic dysregulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638565>[Knockout of TLR2 gene attenuates  and promotes  polarization of macrophages in mice].</a></h2><p>Objective To study the effect of deletion of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) gene on  and polarization of macrophages in mice. Methods The wild-type (WT) and TLR2 knockout (TLR2) C57BL/6 male mice, aged 28 days, were selected, with 12 mice in each group. The genotype of each mouse was identified by PCR. After mice were fed with basic diet for 3 months, the glucose tolerance test (GTT) and  test (ITT) were performed. The mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood were stimulated with GM-CSF/IFN-γ and M-CSF/IL-4/IL-13, respectively, to induce differentiation to M1-like and -like macrophages. The CD11b, F4/80, CD11c, CD206 and early growth response 2 (EGR2) were detected by flow cytometry to determine the phenotype of macrophages. The levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 in the culture supernatant of macrophages were detected using ELISA. Results The result of PCR identification was consistent with the genotype of mice. Compared to WT mice, TLR2 mice exhibited the significantly improved glycemic control at 30 min during GTT and the significantly increased  sensitivity at 15 minutes during ITT. The flow cytometry showed that M1 markers decreased and  macrophages increased in the TLR2 mice. ELISA showed that the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α significantly decreased in the culture supernatant of M1 macrophages, while the level of IL-10 significantly increased in the culture supernatant of  macrophages in TLR2 mice compared with WT mice. Conclusion TLR2 signal has an effect on the polarization of macrophages and makes macrophages tend to switch to M1 phenotype.

Here, we demonstrate that TACI-deficient mice subjected to high-fat diet (HFD) are protected from weight gain and dysregulated glucose homeostasis.  to HFD-induced metabolic changes in TACI-deficient mice does not involve TACI-mediated adipogenesis. Instead, accumulation of  macrophages (Mϕs), eosinophils, and type 2 innate lymphoid cells in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is implicated in the protection from obesity-induced assaults. In support of this hypothesis, adoptively transferred TACI-deficient peritoneal or adipose tissue Mϕs, but not B cells, can improve glucose metabolism in the obese host. Interestingly, the transferred TACI-deficient Mϕs not only home to host VAT but also trigger the accumulation of host  Mϕs and eosinophils in VAT. The increase in host  Mϕs in VAT is likely a result of eosinophil recruitment in response to eotaxin-2 produced by TACI-deficient Mϕs.  signaling experiments revealed that IL-10 secreted by TACI-deficient Mϕs is responsible for maintaining adipocyte  sensitivity. Thus, the adoptive transfer experiments offer a model where TACI-deficient Mϕs accumulate in VAT and protect against metaflammation and obesity-associated dysregulation of glucose metabolism.© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29432480>Influence of body variables in the development of metabolic syndrome-A long term follow-up study.</a></h2><p>The body variable associated with the diagnosis of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is an elevated waist circumference (WC), although a number of other variables have been suggested.

An elevated WHtR provided the best correlation with MetS in a prior study in a large Italian population. In order to assess the validity of this conclusion, a long-term follow-up study re-examined this population, also in order to detect possible associations with cardiovascular (CV) risk.1,071 subjects with a complete follow-up of over 6 years were evaluated with a comparative assessment of the three anthropometric variables, namely WHtR, WC and body mass index (BMI). WHtR≥ 0.5 had the highest sensitivity for the identification of MetS, both in males and females (94.1% and 86.7% respectively). WHtR was of reduced specificity, occurring, yet less frequently (17.7% in males and 30% in females), in patients without MetS. By contrast, enlarged WC occurred with a lower frequency in male patients who developed MetS (30.2%) whereas in females, frequency was higher than in males (69.3%).

Diabetes and impaired kidney function are common side effects of immunosuppressive therapy. This study addresses glucometabolic parameters and kidney function during the first year.We examined 67 patients with functioning grafts (SPK n = 30, PTA n = 37) transplanted between September 2011 and November 2016 who underwent repeated oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) 8 and 52 weeks after transplantation. Another 19 patients lost their graft the first year post-transplant and 28 patients did not undergo repeated OGTTs and could not be studied. All patients received ATG induction therapy plus tacrolimus, mycophenolate and prednisolone. Glomerular filtration rate was measured before and 8 and 52 weeks after transplantation by serum clearance methods.From week 8 to 52 after transplantation, mean fasting glucose decreased (SPK: 5.4 ± 0.7 to 5.1 ± 0.8 mmol/L, PTA: 5.4 ± 0.6 to 5.2 ± 0.7 mmol/L; both P < 0.05), and also 120-min post-OGTT glucose (SPK: 6.9 ± 2.9 to 5.7 ± 2.2 mmol/L; P = 0.07, PTA: 6.5 ± 1.7 to 5.7 ± 1.2 mmol/L; P < 0.05).

The characteristics of renal disease in the syndrome have not been systematically described. The aim of this study is to define the onset and progression of renal disease in AS.Prospective observational cohort study.Thirty-two adult subjects from a national specialist clinic in UK and 86 subjects from an international AS registry were studied.First, an international registry cross-sectional study across all age groups to determine change in kidney function was performed. Secondly, a detailed assessment was carried out of adult AS patients with serial follow-up to determine incidence, aetiology and progression of renal disease.Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate the relationship between age and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Associations between patient factors and eGFR levels were then assessed in the adult AS cohort.The international registry study of the renal function of 118 subjects with AS (median age 21 years) showed a rapid decline with age, at an average of -16.7 and -10.9 mL/min/1.73  per decade in males and females, respectively. In a UK national cohort of 32 patients with AS (median age 22 years), 20/32 (63%) had chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stage 3 or above based on eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73  or evidence of albuminuria. Hyperuricaemia was noted in 25/32 (79%). Structural abnormalities such as nephrocalcinosis without hypercalcaemia and cysts were observed in 20/32 (63%) subjects. Lower urinary tract symptoms were frequent in 17/19 (70%) of AS patients. Histological evidence showed mixed tubulo-interstitial and glomerular disease.This is the first study to demonstrate that renal disease is the hallmark of AS, which starts early and progresses with age, leading to a high prevalence of advanced CKD at young age. AS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of rare genetic renal diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30701811>The role of systemic inflammation in the pathogenesis of  and metabolic syndrome in patients with chronic hepatitis C.</a></h2><p>To determine the role of nonspecific inflammation in the formation of IR and metabolic syndrome in patients with chronic hepatitis C.The study included 205 patients with CHC aged 18 to 69 years.

Therefore, it has been associated with higher risk for coronary artery disease and cardiovascular mortality. Also, increased levels of SUA have been associated with regional arterial stiffness, assessed by pulse wave velocity (PWV).To evaluate the relationships of PWV, SUA and different metabolic parameters in essential hypertensive patients.We evaluated 445 essential hypertensive patients, by measuring office blood pressure (BP), weight, height, and waist circumference. In each patient, blood samples were drawn for biochemical evaluations and 24h urine collection. Body Mass Index (BMI) and Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) were calculated. Carotid-Femoral PWV and Left Ventricular Mass Index (LVMI) were measured in all patients.All subjects (n=402), 242 males (55±0.9 yrs.; BMI: 28.9±0.3 Kg/) and 160 females (58±1 yrs.; BMI: 28.1±0.4 Kg/) had normal renal function. PWV values showed a significant association with SUA (p<0.001), Systolic BP (p<0.025) and LVMI (p<0.05). SUA showed a significant association, p<0.025: with BMI, Waist Circumference, and HDL-C; p<0.05: with Glycaemia at 120 min,  at 120 min, TG, and LVMI; and p<0.001: with serum Creatinine. Backward Stepwise Regression showed that PWV could be predicted from SUA (p<0.001) and Systolic BP (p<0.05). BMI, Waist Circumference, DBP and HR did not significantly add to the ability of the equation to predict PWV.In this population of essential hypertensive patients, SUA was associated to increased arterial stiffness and to components of the Metabolic Syndrome. These results raise the possibility that a new approach to the role of SUA, linked to cardiovascular stratification, and a most appropriate treatment might be considered.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31058962>Cardiovascular Effects of Pioglitazone or Sulfonylureas According to Pretreatment Risk: Moving Toward Personalized Care.</a></h2><p>Hypoglycemic drugs with proven cardiovascular (CV) benefits are recommended for patients with type 2 diabetes and CV disease.

Within each group, the effect of SUs or pioglitazone on the outcome was evaluated.Sex was the first splitting variable, followed by urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) (>9 mg/g or ≤9 mg/g) and body mass index (BMI) (>28.7 or ≤28.7 kg/). Female patients had the lowest risk (reference); male patients with UACR >9 mg/g and BMI >28.7 kg/ had the highest risk [hazard ratio (HR), 5.58; 95% CI, 3.32 to 9.69].

Cancers were verified by central medical record review and deaths verified by medical record and death certificate review enhanced by National Death Index queries. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. All statistical tests were two-sided.During a median of 18.9 years of follow-up, 1820 cancer deaths and 7415 total deaths occurred. Higher HOMA-IR quartile was associated with higher cancer-specific mortality (Q4 vs Q1, HR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.09 to 1.47; Ptrend = .003) and all-cause mortality (Q4 vs Q1, HR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.51 to 1.76; Ptrend < .001). A sensitivity analysis for diabetes status did not change findings. Among women with body mass index less than 25 kg/, higher HOMA-IR quartile was associated with higher cancer mortality (Fine and Gray, P = .004).High , as measured by HOMA-IR, identifies postmenopausal women at higher risk for cancer-specific and all-cause mortality who could potentially benefit from early intervention.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, treatment modalities targeting ATMs remain limited. The effects of lycopene, an antioxidant carotenoid compound, on adipose tissue inflammation and  in high fat (HF)-diet-induced obese mice are examined.C57BL/6J mice are fed an HF diet or an HF diet containing lycopene (HF+LY) for 8 weeks. Lycopene attenuates HF-diet-induced glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia. Compared with HF mice, HF+LY mice exhibit attenuated adipocyte hypertrophy and macrophage infiltration in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) and hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Flow cytometry analysis of ATMs demonstrates that lycopene attenuated the increased number of ATMs in HF diet-fed mice. In addition, HF+LY mice have 23% fewer M1-polarized ATMs and 60% more -polarized ATMs than HF mice, resulting in the predominance of  over M1 in the ATM population. -dominant polarization is also seen in hepatic macrophages in HF+LY mice.

The complex interaction between hyperglycemia and lipoprotein abnormalities promotes the development of atherogenesis. In the early phase of atherosclerosis, macrophage-derived foam cells play an important role in vascular remodeling. Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway has been identified to play an essential role in the initiation, progression, and complication of atherosclerosis. Recently sestrin2, an antioxidant, was shown to modulate TOR activity and thereby regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. But the role of sestrin2 in monocyte activation is still not clearly understood. Hence, this study is focussed on investigating the role of sestrin2 in monocyte activation under hyperglycemic and dyslipidemic conditions. High-glucose and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) treatments mediated proinflammatory cytokine production (M1) with a concomitant decrease in the anti-inflammatory cytokine () levels in human monocytic THP1 cells. Both glucose and oxidized LDL (OxLDL) in a dose and time-dependent manner increased the mTOR activation with a marked reduction in the levels of pAMPK and sestrin2 expression. Both high-glucose and OxLDL treatment increased foam cell formation and adhesion of THP1 cells to endothelial cells. Experiments employing activator or inhibitor of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) as well as overexpression or silencing of sestrin2 indicated that high-glucose mediated monocyte polarization and adhesion of monocytes to the endothelial cells were appeared to be programmed via sestrin2-AMPK-mTOR nexus. Our results evidently suggest that sestrin2 plays a major role in regulating monocyte activation via the AMPK-mTOR-pathway under diabetic and dyslipidemic conditions and also AMPK regulates sestrin2 in a feedback mechanism.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30689902>Clinical Features of Nonobese, Apparently Healthy, Japanese Men With Reduced Adipose Tissue  Sensitivity.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue  has been observed in obese subjects and is considered an early metabolic defect that precedes  in muscle and liver. Although Asians can readily develop metabolic disease without obesity, the clinical features of nonobese, apparently healthy, Asians with reduced adipose tissue  sensitivity (ATIS) have not been elucidated.To investigate the clinical parameters associated with reduced ATIS in nonobese, apparently healthy (body mass index <25 kg/), Japanese men.We studied 52 nonobese Japanese men without cardiometabolic risk factors. Using a two-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp with a glucose tracer, we evaluated the  sensitivity in muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. ATIS was calculated as the percentage of free fatty acid (FFA) suppression/ concentration during the first step of the glucose clamp.Using the median ATIS value, the subjects were divided into low- and high-FFA suppression groups. The low-FFA suppression group had moderate fat accumulation in the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue and liver. Compared with the high-FFA group, they also had a lower fitness level, decreased  clearance, impaired  sensitivity in muscle, moderately elevated triglycerides, and lowered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. All these factors correlated significantly with ATIS. Hepatic  sensitivity was comparable between the two groups.In nonobese, apparently healthy, Japanese men, reduced ATIS was associated with moderate fat accumulation in subcutaneous fat and liver, lower  clearance, muscle , and moderate lipedema. These data suggest that reduced ATIS can occur early in the development of the metabolic syndrome, even in nonobese, apparently healthy, men.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30239760>Physiology of Glycemic Recovery and Stabilization After Hyperinsulinemic Euglycemic Clamp in Healthy Subjects.</a></h2><p>The hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (HEC) is the gold standard for measuring  sensitivity, but glycemic recovery and stabilization after the procedure have not been well studied. Here, we assessed the physiological determinants of postclamp recovery.We analyzed data from 207 healthy subjects [102 African American (AA) and 105 European American (EA)] who underwent HEC in the Pathobiology of Prediabetes in a Biracial Cohort study. At the end of HEC,  infusion was stopped, and dextrose (20%) infusion was tapered and stopped when plasma glucose stabilized ≥20 mg/dL above the preclamp value (∼100 mg/dL). Glucose recovery time (GRT) was defined as the interval from cessation of  infusion to discontinuation of dextrose infusion.  clearance was calculated under basal and clamp conditions.The mean (± SD) age and body mass index were 46.3 ± 9.96 years and 30.7 ± 8.43 kg/, respectively. Plasma glucose (mg/dL) was 92.2 ± 6.26 preclamp and 124.2 ± 26.9 postclamp. The median GRT (minutes) was 65 (range, 30 to 270); mean GRT was 77.1 ± 42.7 (men: 82.9 ± 45.5; women: 74.4 ± 42.3; AA, 82.0 ± 49.6; EA, 72.3 ± 34.2; P > 0.1 for sex or race). The 90th percentile for GRT was 119 minutes. In regression models, significant predictors of GRT were age (P = 0.03), weight (P = 0.009), 2-hour plasma glucose (P = 0.0002),  sensitivity (P = 0.03), disposition index (P = 0.017), and basal  clearance (P = 0.02).In our biracial cohort, glycemic recovery after hyperinsulinemic clamp was independent of sex or race but was significantly predicted by age, weight, and glucose tolerance and by  sensitivity, secretion, and clearance. We recommend that monitoring be maintained for ∼2 hours postclamp to ensure adequate glycemic stabilization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31465179>Glomerular function and metabolic syndrome in Venezuelan adults with cardiometabolic risk factors treated in a primary health care center.</a></h2><p>The relationship of the metabolic syndrome (MS) and its components with the reduced glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria is not yet widely elucidated. The aim of the study was to associate the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and proteinuria to MS and its individual components in adults with cardiometabolic risk factors, who attended a public health center in the municipality of San Diego, Carabobo State, Venezuela.Descriptive and cross-sectional study (n=176 individuals). Weight, height, waist circumference, body fat percentage and blood pressure were measured; serum glucose, creatinine, urea, ureic nitrogen, total cholesterol, low (LDLc) and high (HDLc) density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides and glycosylated hemoglobin A1C in whole blood were determined; the presence of proteinuria was determined in partial urine. The eGFR was estimated by equations and the body mass index (BMI) was calculated.The frequency of MS was significantly higher among patients with CKD (eGFR < 60 mL/min/), mildly reduced eGFR (60-89 mL/min/), hyperfiltration or proteinuria. The risks of mildly reduced eGFR and protenuria were significantly associated with elevated fasting blood glucose, low HDLc and MS, with and without adjustment for sex, age and BMI. When adjusted for the diabetic condition, only the risk of proteinuria remained associated with MS and elevated blood pressure. The risk of hyperfiltration was not associated with MS.The reduction in estimated glomerular function and proteinuria were associated with MS and its individual components.

Obesity-associated chronic low-grade systemic inflammation is considered a focal point and a therapeutic target in  and metabolic diseases. We evaluate the effect of  (PF) on  and its mechanism based on inflammatory responses in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Mice were fed an HFD to induce obesity and then administered PF. Body weight, epididymal fat and liver weight, glucose, lipid, , and histologic characteristics were evaluated to determine the effect of PF on  by analyzing the proportion of macrophages in epididymal fat and liver and measured inflammatory gene expression. PF administration significantly decreased the fasting and postprandial glucose, fasting , HOMA-IR, total-cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The epididymal fat tissue and liver showed a significant decrease of fat accumulation in histological analysis. PF significantly reduced the number of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs), F4/80 Kupffer cells, and CD68 Kupffer cells, increased the proportion of  phenotype macrophages, and decreased the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines. These results suggest that PF could be used to improve  through modulation of macrophage-mediated inflammation and enhance glucose and lipid metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116758>Relationship between DXA measured metrics of adiposity and glucose homeostasis; An analysis of the NHANES data.</a></h2><p>Obesity is associated with  and type 2 diabetes. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a means of determining body composition and body fat distribution at different sites including whole body and trunk-locations where there tends to be high correlation at an individual level.We performed an analysis of DXA-derived metrics of adiposity (truncal fat %,subtotal fat % and total fat %) from the NHANES database and then correlated the findings with markers of . We analyzed the data from DXA scans in NHANES 1999-2004. Homeostatic model assessment- and HOMA-β (beta-cell function) were estimated. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated (ρ) between HOMA-IR,HOMA-β and different measures of obesity (Waist circumference(in cm), Body Mass Index (kg/), truncal fat %, subtotal fat % as well as total fat %) to gauge the relationship between markers of glucose homeostasis and DXA derived metrics of obesity. We also performed logarithmic transformation of HOMA-IR as well as HOMA-β to ensure normality of distribution and to meet the criteria for regression analysis. A forward selection model (by outcome and gender) was performed to predict log transformed  (log HOMA-IR) as well as log transformed HOMA-β (log HOMA-β,measure of beta cell function) from age, serum triglycerides, HDL, trunk fat % and the SBP (in both males and females separately), after reviewing the spearman correlation coefficients.There were a total of 6147 men and 6369 women who were part of the study cohort. There was a positive correlation between markers of adiposity and log HOMA-IR and log HOMA-β in both males and females.Truncal fat % had the highest nonparametric correlation coefficent with log HOMA-IR among the DXA derived fat% (0.54 in males and 048 in females). In the multivariate analysis, truncal fat % was an independent predictor of logHOMA-IR as well as logHOMA-β. In males, the significant predictors of log HOMA-IR were; age, truncal fat % and HDL cholesterol (Adjusted R square of 0.325 (±0.66), F(3,207) = 34.63, p < .01).

Design The Kailuan study is a community-based prospective cohort study. Methods BMI and metabolic syndrome (MetS) were assessed in 91 866 participants without a history of MI or stroke. Participants were categorised into six mutually exclusive groups according to the BMI-MetS status: normal weight (BMI: ≤ 18.5to < 24.0 kg/) without MetS (MH-NW), normal weight with MetS (MUH-NW), overweight (BMI: ≤ 24.0to < 28.0 kg/) without MetS (MH-OW), overweight with MetS (MUH-OW), obese (BMI ≥ 28.0 kg/) without MetS (MHO) and obese with MetS (MUO). The hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI was calculated for the incidence of MI using a multivariable Cox model. Results A total of 6745 (7.34%) individuals were classified as MHO. During a median 8-year follow-up, 1167 (1.27%) participants developed MI. The MHO group had an increased risk of MI (HR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.37-2.25) in comparison with the MH-NW group after adjusting for potential confounding variables. After a similar adjustment, the risk of MI was significantly elevated in the MUH-NW (HR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.28-2.05), MUH-OW (HR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.67-2.35) and MUO group (HR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.70-2.49). Conclusions MHO subjects showed a substantially higher risk of MI in comparison with MH-NW subjects. That said, even without measurable metabolic abnormalities, obesity was associated with a higher risk of MI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30137481>A Ketogenic Diet Reduces Central Obesity and Serum  in Women with Ovarian or Endometrial Cancer.</a></h2><p>The glycolytic nature of cancer cells presents a potential treatment target that may be addressed by a ketogenic diet (KD).We hypothesized that a KD would improve body composition and lower serum  and -like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in women with ovarian or endometrial cancer.In this randomized controlled trial, women with ovarian or endometrial cancer [age: ≥19 y; body mass index (kg/): ≥18.5] were randomly assigned to a KD (70:25:5 energy from fat, protein, and carbohydrate) or the American Cancer Society diet (ACS; high-fiber, low-fat). Body composition (DXA) and fasting serum , IGF-I, and β-hydroxybutyrate were obtained at baseline and at 12 wk; urinary ketones were also measured throughout the intervention. We assessed differences between the diets with ANCOVA and independent t tests. We used correlation analyses to estimate associations between changes in serum analytes and body composition.After 12 wk, the KD (compared with ACS) group had lower adjusted total (35.3 compared with 38.0 kg, P < 0.05) and android (3.0 compared with 3.3 kg, P < 0.05) fat mass. Percentage of change in visceral fat was greater in the KD group (compared with the ACS group; -21.2% compared with -4.6%, P < 0.05). Adjusted total lean mass did not differ between the groups. The KD (compared with ACS) group had lower adjusted fasting serum  (7.6 compared with 11.2 µU/mL, P < 0.01). There was a significant inverse association between the changes in serum β-hydroxybutyrate and IGF-I concentrations (r = -0.57; P < 0.0001).In women with ovarian or endometrial cancer, a KD results in selective loss of fat mass and retention of lean mass. Visceral fat mass and fasting serum  also are reduced by the KD, perhaps owing to enhanced  sensitivity. Elevated serum β-hydroxybutyrate may reflect a metabolic environment inhospitable to cancer proliferation.

Studies to date comparing IER to continuous energy restriction (CER) have predominantly measured fasting indices of cardiometabolic risk. This study aimed to compare the effects of IER and CER on postprandial glucose and lipid metabolism following matched weight loss. In all, twenty-seven (thirteen male) overweight/obese participants (46 (sem 3) years, 30·1 (sem 1·0) kg/) who were randomised to either an IER intervention (2638 kJ for 2 d/week with an overall ER of 22 (sem 0·3) %, n 15) or a CER intervention (2510 kJ below requirements with overall ER of 23 (sem 0·8) %) completed the study. Postprandial responses to a test meal (over 360 min) and changes in anthropometry (fat mass, fat-free mass, circumferences) were assessed at baseline and upon attainment of 5 % weight loss, following a 7-d period of weight stabilisation. The study found no statistically significant difference in the time to attain a 5 % weight loss between groups (median 59 d (interquartile range (IQR) 41-80) and 73 d (IQR 48-128), respectively, P=0·246), or in body composition (P≥0·437). For postprandial measures, neither diet significantly altered glycaemia (P=0·266), whereas insulinaemia was reduced comparatively (P=0·903). The reduction in C-peptide tended (P=0·057) to be greater following IER (309 128 (sem23 268) to 247781 (sem20 709) pmol×360 min/l) v. CER (297 204 (sem25 112) to 301 655 (sem32 714) pmol×360 min/l).

We used data from Project Viva, a well-characterized birth cohort from Boston with repeated measures of BMI, to help fill this gap.Among 1681 children with BMI data from birth to mid childhood, we fitted individual BMI trajectories using mixed-effects models with natural cubic splines and estimated age, and magnitude of BMI, at peak (in infancy) and rebound (in early childhood). We obtained cardiometabolic measures of the children in early adolescence (median 12.9 years) and analysed their associations with the BMI parameters.After adjusting for potential confounders, age and magnitude at infancy BMI peak were associated with greater adolescent adiposity, and earlier adiposity rebound was strongly associated with greater adiposity,  and metabolic risk score independently of BMI peak. Children with a normal timing of BMI peak plus early rebound had an adverse cardiometabolic profile, characterized by higher fat mass index {β 2.2 kg/ [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6, 2.9]}, trunk fat mass index [1.1 kg/ (0.8, 1.5)],  [0.2 units (0.04, 0.4)] and metabolic risk score [0.4 units (0.2, 0.5)] compared with children with a normal BMI peak and a normal rebound pattern. Children without a BMI peak (no decline in BMI after the rise in infancy) also had adverse adolescent metabolic profiles.Early age at BMI rebound is a strong risk factor for cardiometabolic risk, independent of BMI peak. Children with a normal peak-early rebound pattern, or without any BMI decline following infancy, are at greatest risk of adverse cardiometabolic profile in adolescence. Routine monitoring of BMI may help to identify children who are at greatest risk of developing an adverse cardiometabolic profile in later life and who may be targeted for preventive interventions.© The Author(s) 2019; all rights reserved.

Accumulation of visceral fat is the main cause of the decrease in  sensitivity. OBJECTIVES We aimed to evaluate changes in anthropometric parameters, indirect measures of , and safety of treatment with metformin added to intensive  therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes and excess body fat. PATIENTS AND METHODS We analyzed 114 patients (60 women and 54 men; median age, 31 years [range, 18-60 years]), with a median diabetes duration of 14 years (range, 10-20 years). Metformin was administered for at least 6 months in 74 patients, while 40 patients did not receive metformin. The study group was randomized in a 2:1 ratio. Total body fat assessment and laboratory tests were performed before the study and at 6-month follow-up. RESULTS At 6 months, in the metformin group, compared with the non-metformin group, an improvement was noted for adiposity parameters (reduction in body mass index, -0.4 kg/ vs 0.6 kg/, P = 0.006; waist circumference, -5 cm vs 3.5 cm, P = 0.02; and total body fat, -1.7 kg vs 1.4 kg; P <0.001; glycated hemoglobin A1c: -0.6% vs 0.2%, P <0.001), as well as for lipid parameters and blood pressure. An increase in the estimated glomerular filtration rate was greater in the metformin compared with the non-metformin group: 0.9 mg/kg/min vs -0.2 mg/kg/min, P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS In patients with type 1 diabetes and excess body fat, treated with intensive functional  therapy, the addition of metformin improves metabolic control of diabetes at 6 months. Metformin added to  therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes and excess body fat appears to be safe.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31393981>Indirect Effects of a Cognitive-Behavioral Intervention on Adolescent Weight and  Through Decreasing Depression in a Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>Depression is linked to excess weight, , and type 2 diabetes (T2D). We previously reported that in adolescent girls at-risk for T2D with moderately elevated depression, randomization to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) produced greater decreases in depression at post-treament and greater decreases in fasting/2-h  at 1 year, compared to health education (HE). The current study is a secondary analysis of this parallel-group randomized controlled trial. We examined whether decreasing depression explained intervention effects on body composition and  outcomes. We hypothesized that decreases in depression would be an explanatory mediator and that indirect effects would be strongest at higher levels of baseline depression.Participants were 12-17 years girls with overweight/obesity and family history of T2D randomized to 6-week group CBT (n = 58) or HE (n = 61). Procedures took place at an outpatient pediatric clinic. At baseline, post-treatment, and 1 year, adolescents completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale to assess depression symptoms; body mass index (BMI [kg/]) was measured from height/fasting weight;  was derived from 2-h oral glucose testing. Adiposity was assessed with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at baseline and 1 year. Indirect effects of intervention were tested on 1-year changes in BMI, adiposity, and  through decreases in depression. Baseline depression was tested as a moderator of mediation.There was an indirect effect of CBT on decreased 1-year fasting  via decreases in depression during treatment, among adolescents with more elevated baseline depression.Decreasing elevated depression may be one mechanism in the targeted prevention of T2D in at-risk adolescents.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of Pediatric Psychology 2019.

Although it has been speculated that kidney function decline associated with elevated adiponectin is attributable to decreased renal clearance and compensatory responses to adiponectin , it is unclear how elevated adiponectin affects clinical outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and whether the effects are the same as those in the general population. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine whether the association between serum adiponectin levels and clinical outcomes in non-diabetic CKD patients is independent of adiposity and metabolic syndrome. We enrolled 196 non-diabetic CKD patients with eGFR ranging between 10 and 60 mL/min/1.73 , these patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of metabolic syndrome. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality or renal events (renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy [RRT] or 50% reduction in eGFR). During the mean follow-up period of 5 years, 48 (24.5%) incident cases of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were observed, and 33 (16.8%) deaths occurred. The mean eGFR was 29.8 ± 12.8 mL/min/1.73m2. The baseline median adiponectin concentration in the cohort was 29.4(interquartile range, 13.3-108.7) μg/ml. Adiponectin levels were inversely related to body mass index (BMI) (r = -0.29; P < 0.001) and waist circumference (r = -0.35; P < 0.001). In the fully adjusted Cox regression model, the hazard ratios (HRs) were 2.08 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-4.02; P = 0.03) for RRT and 1.66 (95% CI, 1.03-2.65; P = 0.04) for composite renal outcome. The risks remained consistent within different subgroups. However, no association was observed with mortality risk. In conclusion, higher adiponectin levels are associated with a higher risk of ESRD independent of conventional risk factors, BMI, and metabolic syndrome components.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30229891>Properties and functions of adipose tissue macrophages in obesity.</a></h2><p>The expansion of adipose tissue (AT) in obesity is accompanied by the accumulation of immune cells that contribute to a state of low-grade, chronic inflammation and dysregulated metabolism. Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) represent the most abundant class of leukocytes in AT and are involved in the regulation of several regulatory physiological processes, such as tissue remodeling and  sensitivity. With progressive obesity, ATMs are key mediators of meta-inflammation,  and impairment of adipocyte function. While macrophage recruitment from blood monocytes is a critical component of the generation of AT inflammation, new studies have revealed a role for ATM proliferation in the early stages of obesity and in sustaining AT inflammation. In addition, studies have revealed a more complex range of macrophage activation states than the previous M1/ model, and the existence of different macrophage profiles between human and animal models. This review will summarize the current understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of ATM function in relation to obesity, type 2 diabetes, depot of origin, and to other leukocytes such as AT dendritic cells, with hopes of emphasizing the regulatory nodes that can potentially be targeted to prevent and treat obesity-related metabolic disorders.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30496579>Prepregnancy Fat Free Mass and Associations to Glucose Metabolism Before and During Pregnancy.</a></h2><p>Our aim was to quantify the individual contribution of prepregnancy (PP) fat-free mass (FFM), expressed as [PP-FFM index (PP-FFMI) = FFM (kg)/height ()], on markers of glucose homeostasis before and during pregnancy.Body composition was assessed in 43 women before pregnancy using air-displacement plethysmography.

Immune cells such as macrophages can infiltrate adipose tissue and are responsible for the majority of inflammatory cytokine production. Therefore, adipose tissue promotes macrophage infiltration, resulting in local inflammation and . Tim-3 negatively regulates IFN-γ secretion and influences the ability to induce T cell tolerance in diabetes. MicroRNA contributes to the development of immunological tolerance and involves in macrophage polarization. However, the potential of Tim-3 to regulate macrophage polarization and the related microRNA has not been reported. In this experiment, 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. The adipose tissue macrophages were isolated, miR-330-5p and Tim-3 levels, and M1/ polarization were analyzed. In addition,  tolerance tests was detected. The results demonstrated that miR-330-5p levels increased but Tim-3 levels decreased, leading to M1 polarization and  tolerance in diabetes mice. In addition, inhibition of miR-330-5p enhanced Tim-3 levels, leading to  polarization and  tolerance attenuation in diabetes mice. Furthermore, we detected the inverse relationship between miR-330-5p and Tim-3. We found that Tim-3 mRNA contained conserved miR-330-5p binding sites in its 3'UTR, and miR-330-5p could directly regulate Tim-3 expression through these 3'UTR sites. Our study demonstrated that miR-330-5p served as a regulator of the  polarization and miR-330-5p/Tim-3 axis potentially down-regulated  in diabetes, probably through enhancing the  polarization of macrophage.Copyright © 2018.

MerTK is mainly expressed in anti-inflammatory  macrophages where it mediates transcriptional changes including suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and enhancement of inflammatory repressors. MerTK is regulated by metabolic pathways through nuclear sensors including LXRs, PPARs, and RXRs, in response to apoptotic bodies or to other sources of cholesterol. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most serious public health problems worldwide. It is a clinicopathological syndrome closely related to obesity, , and oxidative stress. It includes a spectrum of conditions ranging from simple steatosis, characterized by hepatic fat accumulation with or without inflammation, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), defined by hepatic fat deposition with hepatocellular damage, inflammation, and accumulating fibrosis. Several studies support an association between NAFLD and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis, a major cause of death worldwide. This pathological condition consists in a chronic and progressive inflammatory process in the intimal layer of large- and medium-sized arteries. The complications of advanced atherosclerosis include chronic or acute ischemic damage in the tissue perfused by the affected artery, leading to cellular death. By identifying specific targets influencing lipid metabolism and cardiovascular-related diseases, the present review highlights the role of MerTK in NAFLD-associated atherosclerotic lesions as a potential innovative therapeutic target. Therapeutic advantages might derive from the use of compounds selective for nuclear receptors targeting PPARs rather than LXRs regulating macrophage lipid metabolism and macrophage mediated inflammation, by favoring the expression of MerTK, which mediates an immunoregulatory action with a reduction in inflammation and in atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29581238>Role of dysfunctional adipocytes in cholesterol-induced nonobese metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Many studies have reported the causes of obese metabolic syndrome (MS); however, the causes of nonobese MS (NMS) remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that inflamed dysfunctional adipose tissue plays a crucial role in cholesterol-induced NMS. Control (C), high cholesterol (HC) and HC with 10% fructose in drinking water (HCF) diets were fed to Sprague-Dawley rats for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, the body weights of the C- and HC-fed rats were comparable, but the weights of the HCF-fed rats were relatively low. Cholesterol caused metabolic problems such as high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia and hypoinsulinemia. The HCF-fed rats exhibited whole-body  with low circulating high-density lipoprotein levels. Increases in the tumor necrosis factor α level in the plasma, the number of CD68+ macrophages and the free nuclear factor-κB level in gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) resulted in local inflammation, which appeared as inflamed dysfunctional gWAT. Reduced superoxide dismutases (SODs) deteriorate natural antioxidant defense systems and induce reactive oxygen species in gWAT. Dysregulation of plasma levels of catecholamine, adipokines (leptin and adiponectin), hormone-sensitive lipase and perilipin in cholesterol-induced inflamed adipose tissue contributed to increased lipolysis and increased circulating nonesterified fatty acids. Cholesterol activated inflammation, lipolysis and cell death in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, Chol-3T3-CM reduced the population of -type Raw264.7 macrophages, indicating that the macrophage polarization is mediated by cholesterol.

In this study we tested the hypothesis that low proliferative potential of adipose derived stromal cells (ADSC) associates with reduced formation of new fat depots, excess accumulation of fat in the functional adipocytes and their hypertrophy, resulting in fat inflammation and .We screened two groups of obese patients with or without T2DM, matched for BMI, age, and duration of obesity to test the hypothesis that hypertrophy and decreased renewal of adipocytes may underlie transition from obesity to T2DM. All patients were matched for carbohydrate metabolism (fasting blood glucose level, glycated hemoglobin, HOMA-IR index and M-index). The subcutaneous and omental fat tissue biopsies were obtained during bariatric surgery from obese individuals with or without T2DM. The morphology and immunophenotype of subcutaneous and omental fat was assessed in frozen tissue sections. ADSC were isolated from both types of fat tissue biopsies and screened for morphology, proliferative potential and inflammatory status.The non-diabetic patients had normal carbohydrate metabolism and moderate  measured by HOMA-IR and hyperinsulinemic clamp (M-index), while T2DM patients were extremely  resistant by both indexes. The average size of diabetic adipocytes was higher than that of non-diabetic in both subcutaneous and omental fat tissues, indicating adipocyte hypertrophy in T2DM. Both these tissues contained higher level of macrophage infiltration and increased M1-like to -like ratio of macrophage subpopulations, suggesting increased fat inflammation in T2DM. This was confirmed by increased activatory phosphorylation of stress-induced JNK1/2 in diabetic ADSC.These results suggest that blunted proliferation and increased hypertrophy of diabetic ADSC may lead to reduced  sensitivity via increased inflammation mediated by M1 macrophages and JNK1/2 pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

No restriction was applied for language or publication status.Six studies involving 252 participants were included. Women with PCOS and OSA had significantly higher body mass index (mean difference [MD]: 6.01 kg/, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 4.69-7.33), waist circumference (MD: 10.93 cm, 95% CI: 8.03-13.83), , systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and worse lipids' profile and impaired glucose regulation compared with women with PCOS without OSA. Most studies did not adjust for weight in their between-groups analysis. Total and free testosterone levels were not significantly different between the two groups. The majority of studies were found to be at high risk of selection bias, did not account for important confounders, were conducted in one country (United States), and used different methodologies to assess testosterone levels (preventing a meta-analysis for this specific outcome).OSA is associated with obesity and worse metabolic profiles in women with PCOS. However, whether the effects of OSA are independent of obesity remain unclear. As OSA is a treatable condition, research focused on the independent effects of OSA on key clinical outcomes in women with PCOS, including fertility, psychological health, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular risk, is lacking and needed.

The aim of this work was to investigate the role of the serum level of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and other polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD) relevant clinical and biochemical factors as a predictor of spontaneous ovulation after laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) in women with clomiphene citrate resistant polycystic ovarian disease (CCR-PCOD).It was a prospective research work, where 150 infertile women with CCR-PCOD had been recruited. TNF-α serum level, which is an inflammatory biomarker, was investigated in addition to other PCOD relevant clinical and biochemical parameters as possible predictors of successful spontaneous ovulation and subsequent pregnancy after LOD.Recruited women with higher preoperative levels of TNF-α, LH, and androstenedione had significantly higher rates of spontaneous ovulation within the first three months follow up after LOD, in contrast to obese women with BMI ≥ 25 kg/, long duration of infertility ≥3 years, marked biochemical hyperandrogenism (testosterone levels ≥4.5 nmol/L, free androgen index ≥15), and high  (IR). Ninty five (95 = 63.3%) women in between women regularly menstruated (105 = 70%) had spontaneous ovulation, and of those spontaneously ovulated, 35(36.8%) women got pregnant spontaneously during the first 3 months follow up. Extended follow up for 12 months period revealed that 61 women got pregnant, with cumulative pregnancy rate of 58%. Logistic regression showed that the best cut-off values for spontaneous ovulation after LOD were 65.1 pg/ml, 11.5 IU/l, and 3.1 ng/ml and with a sensitivity of 91%, 88%, 55%, and with a specificity of 85%, 79%, 78%, for TNF-α, LH, androstenedione serum level respectively.TNF-α, LH, and Androstenedione could be considered as reliable predictors to depend on for recruiting the ideal women candidates with CCR-PCOD; to have the maximum benefits after LOD treatment option.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, we analyzed the modulation of the gut microbiota in mice infected with the helminth Strongyloides venezuelensis, and fed either a standard rodent chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD). To investigate the effects of the microbiota modulation on the metabolism, we analyzed the expression of tight-junction proteins present in the gut epithelium, inflammatory markers in the serum and tissue and quantified glucose tolerance and  sensitivity and . Additionally, the levels of lipids related to inflammation were evaluated in the feces and serum. Our results show that infection with Strongyloides venezuelensis results in a modification of the gut microbiota, most notably by increasing Lactobacillus spp. These modifications in the microbiota alter the host metabolism by increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, switching macrophages from a M1 to  pattern in the adipose tissue, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins in the intestinal cells (thereby reducing the permeability) and decreasing LPS in the serum. Taken together, these changes correlate with improved  signaling and sensitivity, which could also be achieved with HFD mice treated with probiotics. Additionally, helminth infected mice produce higher levels of oleic acid, which participates in anti-inflammatory pathways. These results suggest that modulation of the microbiota by helminth infection or probiotic treatment causes a reduction in subclinical inflammation, which has a positive effect on the glucose metabolism of the host.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Hepatic fat was measured by proton MRS,  sensitivity index (SI) calculated by minimal modeling from a frequently-sampled intravenous glucose test, RBC fatty acid profiles by gas chromatography were used to estimate SCD-1 indices. Hepatic fat, S, and SCD-1 were similar in black women and lower than in whites, regardless of menopausal status. Fasting and postprandial large, medium and small TRLPs, but not very small TRLPs, were lower in black women. Fasting large, medium and very small TRLPs negatively correlated with S and positively correlated with visceral and hepatic fat, and SCD-1 activity in both groups. In multivariate models, visceral fat and SCD-1 were associated with total fasting TRLP concentrations (adjR= 0.39, P=0.001). Black women had smaller postprandial changes in large (P=0.005) and medium TRLPs (P=0.007).  Lower visceral fat and SCD-1 activity may contribute to the paradoxical association of lower fasting and postprandial TRLP subfractions despite  in black compared to white pre- and post-menopausal women.

Obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/ from measured height and weight. MetS was defined based on the American Heart Association consensus definition. Participants were divided into four groups: healthy normal weight (MHN), metabolically healthy obese (MHO), metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUN), and metabolic unhealthy obese (MUO). C-Reactive protein was assessed in a subsample.A total of 18,025 subjects were included in the analysis. Participants with MUO had the highest prevalence of depression compared with the MHN group (14.8% vs. 6.8, p < .001). While both obesity and MetS were independently associated with depression, there was a significant interaction between the two (p < .001), indicating that the associations of obesity and MetS with depression were synergistic. After adjusting for baseline characteristics, compared with the MHN group, the MUO group had the highest odds of depression (odds ratio [OR] = 2.30, 95% CI [2.03, 2.61]), followed by MHO group (OR = 1.51, 95% CI [1.30, 1.74]) and the MUN group (OR = 1.39, 95% CI [1.18, 1.64]). The MUO group also showed the highest level of C-reactive protein, and the latter partially mediated the effect between MUO and depressive symptoms (20.5% of the total effect).Both obesity and MetS are associated with depression independent of each other, but when present together, these conditions have a synergistic association with depression.

GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3), a serine/threonine kinase, has been reported to participate in various cellular processes. We sought to examine the potential mechanism by which GSK3, a serine/threonine kinase implicated in various cellular processes, modulates obesity-induced visceral adipose tissue (VAT) inflammation. Approach and Results- Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet for 10 weeks while being treated with vehicle control or GSK3 inhibitors SB216763 or CHIR99021. RNA-sequencing results using VAT demonstrated that GSK3 inhibitor treatment reversed obesity-specific expression of genes associated with inflammation. Consistently, GSK3 inhibition reduced obesity-induced VAT inflammation as characterized by decreased proinflammatory M1 macrophages but increased anti-inflammatory  macrophages in the VAT and reduced circulatory inflammatory monocytes. These anti-inflammatory effects of GSK3 inhibition were found to be driven, at least in part, by inhibiting production of apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage in macrophages via inactivating STAT3 to reduce free fatty acid and chemokine level produced from VAT to suppress the migration/chemotaxis of macrophages and monocytes. Conclusions- Our findings suggest that GSK3 may act as an important regulator of obesity-induced inflammation and characterize the novel role of GSK3 in shifting macrophage polarization and reinforce its therapeutic potential for obesity-induced inflammation and its associated diabetes mellitus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29568274>Transplantation of Normal Adipose Tissue Improves Blood Flow and Reduces Inflammation in High Fat Fed Mice With Hindlimb Ischemia.</a></h2><p> Fat deposition is associated with peripheral arterial disease. Adipose tissue has recently been implicated in vascular remodeling and angiogenic activity. We hypothesized that the transplantation of adipose tissues from normal mice improves blood flow perfusion and neovascularization in high-fat diet fed mice.  After 14 weeks of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, unilateral hind limb ischemia was performed. Subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) fat pads were harvested from normal EGFP mice, and subcutaneously transplanted over the region of the adductor muscles of HFD mice. Blood flow was measured using Laser Doppler Scanner. Vascular density, macrophages infiltration, and macrophage polarization were examined by RT-qPCR, and immunohistochemistry.  We found that the transplantation of WAT derived from normal mice improved functional blood flow in HFD-fed mice compared to mice transplanted with BAT and sham-treated mice. WAT transplantation increased the recruitment of pericytes associated with nascent blood vessels, but did not affect capillary formation. Furthermore, transplantation of WAT ameliorated HFD-induced ,  macrophage predominance and the release of arteriogenic factors in ischemic muscles. Mice receiving WAT also displayed a marked reduction in several proinflammatory cytokines. In contrast, mice transplanted with BAT were glucose intolerant and demonstrated increased IL-6 levels in ischemic muscles.  These results indicate that transplantation of adipose tissue elicits improvements in blood perfusion and beneficial effects on systemic glucose homeostasis and could be a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of diabetic peripheral arterial disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29587266>Overexpression of PTPN2 in Visceral Adipose Tissue Ameliorated Atherosclerosis via T Cells Polarization Shift in Diabetic Apoe-/- Mice.</a></h2><p>Dysregulated inflammation in adipose tissue, marked by increased pro-inflammatory T-cell accumulation and reduced regulatory T cells (Treg), contributes to diabetes-associated  and atherosclerosis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying T-cell-mediated inflammation in adipose tissue remain largely unknown.Sixty apolipoprotein E (ApoE-/-) mice were randomly divided into chow and diabetes groups. Diabetes was induced by a high-fat and high-sugar diet combined with low-dose streptozotocin. Then we transferred a recombinant adenovirus carrying the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) gene into epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT) of ApoE-/- mice. After transfection, all mice were euthanized to evaluate the effects of PTPN2 on T cells polarization and atherosclerosis.PTPN2 was downregulated in EWAT of diabetic ApoE-/- mice. PTPN2 overexpression in EWAT reversed the high Th1/Treg and Th17/Treg ratios in EWAT of diabetic mice. In addition, PTPN2 overexpression in EWAT could significantly reduce macrophages infiltration, the ratio of M1/ macrophages and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in EWAT, improving . In aortic root lesions, the vulnerability index were significantly decreased by overexpression of PTPN2 in EWAT.These data suggested that PTPN2 overexpression in EWAT would inhibit systemic inflammation and increase the plaque stability via T cells polarization shift in diabetic mice.© 2018 The Author(s).

NAFLD is associated with hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, resulting in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with advanced fibrosis. Placental extracts have been used to treat various chronic diseases due to their antioxidative effect. However, the effects of the extracts on the development of NASH have yet to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that supplementation with an oral porcine placental extract (PPE) attenuated lipid accumulation and peroxidation, , inflammatory and stress signaling, and fibrogenesis in the liver of NASH model mice fed a high-cholesterol and high-fat diet. The PPE reduced the number of M1-like liver macrophages, but increased the number of anti-inflammatory -like macrophages, resulting in a predominance of  over M1 macrophage populations in the liver of NASH mice. Accordingly, the PPE suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced M1 polarization in isolated murine peritoneal macrophages, whereas it facilitated interleukin 4-induced  polarization. Furthermore, the PPE reduced the hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation associated with the attenuated transforming growth factor-β/Smad3 signaling, both in the liver of NASH mice and in RI-T cells, a HSC line. The PPE may be a potential approach to prevent NASH by limiting lipid peroxidation, promoting  macrophage polarization, and attenuating HSC activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29490097>A High-Fat Compared with a High-Carbohydrate Breakfast Enhances 24-Hour Fat Oxidation in Older Adults.</a></h2><p>The ability to oxidize fat is associated with a lower risk of chronic metabolic disease. Preclinical data in mice showed that a high-fat "breakfast" increased 24-h fat oxidation relative to a high-carbohydrate breakfast.The objectives of this study were to determine whether the timing of macronutrient intake in humans affects daily fuel utilization and to examine associations between fuel utilization and metabolic indexes.Participants were 29 healthy sedentary men and women (aged 55-75 y) with a body mass index (kg/) between 25 and 35.

Although sirtuin 6 (Sirt6) deficiency has previously been implicated in diet-induced obesity and systemic , the adipocyte-specific role of Sirt6 in the regulation of adipose tissue inflammation and systemic metabolic dysfunction in mice fed normal chow and in humans remains elusive. Here, using Adipoq-Cre-mediated adipocyte-specific Sirt6 knockout (aS6KO) mice, we explored whether adipocyte Sirt6 inhibits adipose tissue inflammation and its underlying mechanism. aS6KO mice fed normal chow gained more body weight and fat mass than wild-type mice and exhibited glucose intolerance and systemic . Measurement of plasma and tissue cytokines and flow cytometric analysis of adipose stromal vascular cells indicated a decrease in alternatively activated  macrophages in the adipose tissue of aS6KO mice. Mechanistically, Sirt6 regulated the expression of the canonical type 2 cytokine IL-4 by adipocytes in a cell autonomous manner, which in turn affects  macrophage polarization. Consistent with animal experimental data, the degree of obesity and  demonstrated by the body mass index, fasting blood glucose and HbA1c correlated negatively with the expression of Sirt6 in human visceral fat tissues. Collectively, these results suggest that adipocyte Sirt6 regulates body weight gain and  sensitivity independent of diet, and the increased IL-4 production by Sirt6 and resultant  polarization of adipose tissue macrophages may attenuate proinflammatory responses in adipose tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29949578>Changes in markers for cardio-metabolic disease risk after only 1-2 weeks of a high saturated fat diet in overweight adults.</a></h2><p>Diets high in saturated fat acids (SFA) have been linked with cardio-metabolic disease risk.

In rodents and human patients, RYGB induces an increase in the gene and protein expression levels of the  isoenzyme of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) in the jejunum. Since PKM2 can be secreted in the circulation, our hypothesis was that the circulating levels of PKM2 increase after RYGB. Our data, however, revealed an unexpected finding and a potential new role of PKM2 for the natural history of metabolic syndrome and NAFLD. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, RYGB-treated patients had decreased PKM2 blood levels compared with a well-matched group of patients with severe obesity before RYGB. Interestingly, PKM2 serum concentration correlated with body mass index before but not after the surgery. This prompted us to evaluate other potential mechanisms and sites of PKM2 regulation by the metabolic syndrome and RYGB. We found that in patients with NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the liver had increased PKM2 expression levels, and the enzyme appears to be specifically localized in Kupffer cells. The study of murine models of metabolic syndrome and NASH replicated this pattern of expression, further suggesting a metabolic link between hepatic PKM2 and NAFLD. Therefore, we conclude that PKM2 serum and hepatic levels increase in both metabolic syndrome and NAFLD and decrease after RYGB. Thus, PKM2 may represent a new target for monitoring and treatment of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29939302>Effect of prebiotic (fructooligosaccharide) on uremic toxins of chronic kidney disease patients: a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Microbial-derived uremic toxins, p-cresyl sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS) and indole 3-acetic acid (IAA), have been associated with the burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Secondary outcomes included changes in IS, IAA, serum markers of intestinal permeability (zonulin), gut-trophic factors (epidermal growth factor and glucagon-like peptide-2), eGFR, inflammation (high sensitive c-reactive protein and interleukin-6), homeostatic model assessment-, lipid profile and gastrointestinal symptoms.From 50 participants (54% men, 57.3 ± 14.6 years and eGFR 21.4 ± 7.6 mL/min/1.73 ), 46 completed the follow-up. No changes in dietary intake or gastrointestinal symptoms were observed. There was a trend in the difference of serum total ΔPCS (treatment effect adjusted for baseline levels: -12.4 mg/L; 95% confidence interval (-5.6 to 0.9 mg/L; P = 0.07) and serum-free Δ%PCS [intervention -8.6 (-41.5 to 13.9%) versus placebo 3.5 (-28.8 to 85.5%); P = 0.07] between the groups. The trend in the difference of serum total ΔPCS was independent of eGFR and dietary protein:fiber ratio intake. No difference was found in urinary PCS. Aside from the decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the intervention, no differences were observed in the change of IS, IAA or other secondary outcome between the groups.Our result suggests the potential of FOS in reducing serum total and free PCS in nondiabetic NDD-CKD patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29791650>Metabolic syndrome components are associated with oxidative stress in overweight and obese patients.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of the body mass index (BMI) and the metabolic syndrome (MetS) parameters on oxidative and nitrosative stress in overweight and obese subjects.Individuals were divided into three groups: the control group (G1, n = 131) with a BMI between 20 and 24.9 kg/, the overweight group (G2, n = 120) with a BMI between 25 and 29.9 kg/ and the obese group (G3, n = 79) with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/.G3 presented higher advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs) in relation to G1 and G2 (p = 0.001 and p = 0.011, respectively) whereas G2 and G3 had lower levels of nitric oxide (NO) (p = 0.009 and p = 0.048, respectively) compared to G1. Adjusted for the presence of MetS to evaluate its influence, the levels of AOPPs did not differ between the groups, whereas NO remained significantly lower. Data adjusted by the BMI showed that subjects with higher triacylglycerol levels had higher AOPPs (p = 0.001) and decreased total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter/uric Acid (p = 0.036). Subjects with lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and patients with higher blood pressure showed increased AOPPs (p = 0.001 and p = 0.034, respectively) and lower NO levels (p = 0.017 and p = 0.043, respectively). Subjects who presented  had higher AOPPs (p = 0.024).Nitrosative stress was related to BMI, and protein oxidation and nitrosative stress were related to metabolic changes and hypertension. MetS components were essential participants in oxidative and nitrosative stress in overweight and obese subjects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504693>Lipolysis and Fat Oxidation Are Not Altered with Presleep Compared with Daytime Casein Protein Intake in -Trained Women.</a></h2><p>To date, no studies have directly compared the differences between presleep and daytime protein (PRO) consumption on localized and systemic fat metabolism in active women.The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of presleep compared with daytime PRO supplementation on subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SCAAT) lipolysis and whole-body substrate utilization in women.Thirteen young (mean ± SE age: 22 ± 1 y; BMI: 24.3 ± 0.8 kg/), -trained [1 repetition maximum (1RM) squat percentage of body weight: 135% ± 6%; 1RM bench press percentage of body weight: 82% ± 4%] women volunteered. On overnight experimental visits, participants performed full-body  exercise (RE; 65% 1RM) and were randomly assigned to consume either daytime PRO (PRO, 30 g casein) 30 min post-RE and presleep (30 min before bed) noncaloric, sensory-matched placebo (PLA, 0 g casein) (PRO-PLA), or the opposite (PLA-PRO), switching the order of the supplements on the following visit. SCAAT lipolysis, resting metabolism (indirect calorimetry), and plasma biomarkers (glucose, , nonesterified fatty acids, glycerol) were measured at baseline, overnight, and the next morning.There were no differences in overnight SCAAT lipolysis between conditions indicated by interstitial glycerol concentrations (PRO-PLA: baseline, 669 ± 137; next morning, 321 ± 77.1; PLA-PRO: baseline, 524 ± 109; next morning, 333 ± 68.0 μM), fat oxidation (PRO-PLA: baseline, 5.70 ± 0.35; next morning, 5.00 ± 0.28; PLA-PRO: baseline, 6.59 ± 0.32; next morning, 5.44 ± 0.27 g/min), or any other measure.There was no difference between the effects of daytime and presleep PRO supplementation on SCAAT lipolysis or whole-body substrate utilization in -trained women. Presleep PRO is a viable option for increasing PRO consumption in -trained women because it does not blunt overnight lipolysis, and will therefore likely not lead to increases in subcutaneous abdominal fat.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as .Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31084927>TanshinoneⅡA phenanthroimidazole derivative polarizes macrophage to improve metabolic homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Macrophages infiltrated in adipose tissue play a key role in obesity. Some traditional pharmaceutical compounds may shift the polarization of recruited macrophages to improve metabolic homeostasis. TanshinoneⅡA (TAN2A) is a major active component of Salvia miltiorrhiza, a traditional anti-inflammatory cardiovascular medicine. In our study, we firstly constructed a phenanthroimidazole derivative of TAN2A named TAN20 by chemical synthesis, then identified its structure by chromatography and hydrogen spectroscopy, and finally examined its effects on immunometabolic responses. We found that TAN20 significantly induced the alternatively-activated () rather than the classically-activated macrophages (M1), mainly through releasing the type II cytokines. Such effects were more pronounced than that from TAN2A. Compared to TAN2A, TAN20 substantially reduced body weight, decreased serum free fatty acid and HOMA-IR, and increased  sensitivity in obesity-induced diabetic mice. These effects of TAN20 were further validated on diabetic cynomolgus monkeys, which are closer to human physiological conditions. Taken together, our findings explicitly showed that TAN20 significantly polarized the macrophage and improved metabolic homeostasis in obesity-induced diabetic models, suggesting that TAN20 may be a potential drug against diabetes and obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The classically activated M1 macrophages are key players in the initiation and maintenance of adipose tissue (AT) inflammation. The role of NFATc3 in obesity and AT inflammation is unknown. We set out to determine how deficiency of NFATc3 effected macrophage polarization, inflammation and  in visceral AT of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Nfatc3−/− and WT mice were fed a HFD for 8–17 weeks. Epididymal white AT (eWAT) F4/80(+) cells were characterized by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and quantitative RT-PCR. Results showed that Nfatc3−/− mice developed HFD-induced obesity similar to WT mice, but  sensitivity and glucose tolerance were improved, and liver fat accumulation was reduced in Nfatc3−/− mice compared to WT control mice. Moreover, M1 macrophage content and proinflammatory factors were reduced, whereas the alternatively activated  macrophage content was increased in eWAT of HFD-fed Nfatc3−/− mice compared to that of WT mice. In addition, eWAT  signaling was improved in HFD-fed Nfatc3−/− mice. Importantly, after bone-marrow-derived macrophages had been isolated from Nfatc3−/− mice and cultured in vitro, treatment of these cells with interferon-γ and lipopolysaccharide resulted in reduction of M1 inflammatory markers, suggesting that NFATc3 promoted M1 polarization by a cell-autonomous mechanism. The results demonstrated that NFATc3 played an important role in M1 macrophage polarization, AT inflammation and  in response to obesity through transcriptional activation of proinflammatory genes.© 2018 Society for Endocrinology</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29775461>Effects of aerobic training with and without weight loss on  sensitivity and lipids.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of exercise training with modest or greater weight loss (≥3%) or not (<3%) on  sensitivity, lipoprotein concentrations, and lipoprotein particle size in overweight and obese participants.Adults (N = 163, body mass index: 25-37 [kg/]) participated in 8 months of exercise training.  sensitivity, lipid concentrations, lipid particle size and other cardiometabolic variables were measured at baseline and follow-up. Participants were categorized by whether they achieved at least modest weight loss (≥ 3%) or not (<3%) following the intervention.A greater improvement in  sensitivity was observed in adults performing exercise training with at least modest weight loss (2.2 mU·l-1 ·min -1, CI: 1.5 to 2.8) compared to those who did not (0.8 mU·l-1 ·min -1, CI: 0.5 to 1.2). Similar results were observed for acute  response, triglycerides, non-HDL cholesterol concentration, low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size and high density lipoprotein (HDL) particle size (p<0.05), when all exercise groups were combined. No significant results across weight loss categories were observed for LDL, HDL, glucose, or  levels.The present study suggests that aerobic exercise combined with at least modest weight loss leads to greater improvements in  sensitivity, triglycerides as well as other non-traditional lipid risk factors (non-HDL cholesterol, HDL/LDL particle size).

Elevated plasma proinsulin is a sign of β-cell dysfunction in patients with diabetes/prediabetes. However, the dynamic changes of glucose stimulated proinsulin secretion (GSPS) among nondiabetic individuals remain obscure.To examine GSPS and glucose-stimulated  secretion (GSIS) among individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and to evaluate whether impaired GSPS is an early biomarker of β-cell impairment in individuals with NGT who have subthreshold postprandial plasma glucose (PPG).We evaluated GSPS and GSIS in 116 Chinese adults without diabetes (mean age ± SD, 33.31 ± 9.10 years; mean BMI, 25.24 ± 4.20 kg/) with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) < 5.6 mmol/L. Based on 2hPPG, the participants were divided into three groups: NGT1 (2hPPG < 6.67 mmol/L), NGT2 (6.67 ≤ 2hPPG < 7.78 mmol/L), and IGT (7.78 ≤ 2hPPG<11.1 mmol/L). We analyzed the association of GSIS and GSPS with commonly used indexes of β-cell function,  and family history of diabetes.Although not diagnosed with prediabetes, the individuals with NGT2 have clinical characteristics and high diabetes risk factors similar to those of the IGT group. However, unlike individuals with IGT, NGT2 participants did not exhibit a delayed GSIS. Instead, GSPS was impaired in NGT2 groups but not in NGT1 group.This study suggests that impaired GSPS, but not impaired GSIS, may serve as an early biomarker to identify a subpopulation of NGT with a high risk of diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31365625>Metabolic phenotypes of obese, overweight, and normal weight individuals and risk of chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk is inconsistent in the normal-weight, overweight, and obese individuals due to the heterogeneity of metabolic status. This meta-analysis aimed to examine the combined effects of body mass index (BMI) and metabolic status on CKD risk.The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Knowledge databases were systematically searched up to March 2019 to identify all eligible studies investigating the CKD risk (defined as GFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73  and/or microalbuminuria or proteinuria) associated with the body size phenotypes which are known as metabolically unhealthy normal-weight (MUNW), metabolically healthy overweight (MHOW), metabolically unhealthy overweight, metabolically healthy obese (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUHO). The classification of subjects in included studies as metabolically unhealthy was based on the presence of three components of metabolic syndrome. BMI categorization was based on the criteria of included studies. The risk estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted and pooled using random effects analysis.A total of 9 prospective cohort studies with 128773 participants and 4797 incident cases were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with healthy normal-weight individuals as reference, MUNW and MHO subjects showed an increased risk for CKD events with a pooled RR of 1.58 (95% CI = 1.28-1.96) in MUNW and 1.55 (95% CI = 1.34-1.79) in MHO persons. Also, MHOW was at increased risk for CKD (RR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.20-1.51). MUHO individuals were at the highest risk for the development of CKD (RR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.66-2.72).Individuals with metabolic abnormality, although at normal-weight, have an increased risk for CKD.

Risk for NASH was defined as the presence of one or more of the following biochemical and metabolic parameters (BMPs): fasting glucose ≥100 mg/dl, triglycerides (TG) ≥150 mg/dl, homeostatic model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) ≥2.5, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >54 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >42 IU/L. Body mass index measurement and nutritional assessment were performed by standard procedures. Liver fibrosis stage was determined by liver stiffness measurement using transitional elastography (TE) or by liver biopsy (LB).Risk for NASH was 57% (290/505). Most BMPs values incremented by BMI category. Among 171 at-risk patients, 106 subjects were evaluated by TE and 65 subjects by LB. Abnormal liver stiffness (≥6.0 kPa) was prevalent in 54% (57/106) of the cases, whereas by LB, 91% (59/65) of patients with obesity had NASH and liver fibrosis. Furthermore, liver fibrosis was prevalent in 46% (6/13) in normal weight individuals, whereas 4.6% (3/65) of patients with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/ showed no histopathological abnormalities. Overall, 67.8% (116/171) of the patients had abnormal liver stiffness or NASH. The normal weight patients with liver damage consumed relatively a higher fat-rich diet compared to the other groups whereas the remaining subgroups shared a similar dietary pattern.Young patients with overweight and obesity showed a high prevalence of altered BMPs related to abnormal liver stiffness assessed by TE and NASH by LB. Early diagnostic strategies are required to detect the risk for NASH and avoid further liver damage in populations with a rising prevalence of obesity by defining the risk factors involved in the onset and progression of NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30401004>24-h severe energy restriction impairs postprandial glycaemic control in young, lean males.</a></h2><p>Intermittent energy restriction (IER) involves short periods of severe energy restriction interspersed with periods of adequate energy intake, and can induce weight loss.  sensitivity is impaired by short-term, complete energy restriction, but the effects of IER are not well known. In randomised order, fourteen lean men (age: 25 (sd 4) years; BMI: 24 (sd 2) kg/; body fat: 17 (4) %) consumed 24-h diets providing 100 % (10 441 (sd 812) kJ; energy balance (EB)) or 25 % (2622 (sd 204) kJ; energy restriction (ER)) of estimated energy requirements, followed by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; 75 g of glucose drink) after fasting overnight. Plasma/serum glucose, , NEFA, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) were assessed before and after (0 h) each 24-h dietary intervention, and throughout the 2-h OGTT. Homoeostatic model assessment of  (HOMA2-IR) assessed the fasted response and incremental AUC (iAUC) or total AUC (tAUC) were calculated during the OGTT. At 0 h, HOMA2-IR was 23 % lower after ER compared with EB (P<0·05). During the OGTT, serum glucose iAUC (P<0·001), serum  iAUC (P<0·05) and plasma NEFA tAUC (P<0·01) were greater during ER, but GLP-1 (P=0·161), GIP (P=0·473) and FGF21 (P=0·497) tAUC were similar between trials. These results demonstrate that severe energy restriction acutely impairs postprandial glycaemic control in lean men, despite reducing HOMA2-IR.

Focusing on pancreatic islet β-cells, we compare the physiological FA roles with the pathological ones. Considering FAs not as mere amplifiers of glucose-stimulated  secretion (GSIS), but as parallel  granule exocytosis inductors, partly independent of the K channel closure, we describe the FA initiating roles in the prediabetic state that is induced by retardations in the glycerol-3-phosphate (glucose)-promoted glycerol/FA cycle and by the impaired GPR40/FFA1 (free FA1) receptor pathway, specifically in its amplification by the redox-activated mitochondrial phospholipase, iPLA2γ. Also, excessive dietary FAs stimulate intestine enterocyte incretin secretion, further elevating GSIS, even at low glucose levels, thus contributing to diabetic hyperinsulinemia. With overnutrition and obesity, the FA overload causes impaired GSIS by metabolic dysbalance, paralleled by oxidative and metabolic stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress and numerous pro-apoptotic signaling, all leading to decreased β-cell survival. Lipotoxicity is exerted by saturated FAs, whereas ω-3 polyunsaturated FAs frequently exert antilipotoxic effects. FA-facilitated inflammation upon the recruitment of excess M1 macrophages into islets (over resolving  type), amplified by cytokine and chemokine secretion by β-cells, leads to an inevitable failure of pancreatic β-cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299073>Cardiovascular disease risk in the siblings of women with polycystic ovary syndrome.</a></h2><p>Do the siblings of Asian Indian women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) manifest increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk by carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD)?Siblings had functional endothelial dysfunction (FMD was reduced) when compared to age and BMI-matched controls while sisters but not brothers had structural endothelial dysfunction (CIMT was increased).Siblings of women with PCOS have increased metabolic risk but it varies with ethnicity. Among Asian Indians the only previous study has shown reduced FMD in brothers.This study was a tertiary care hospital-based cross-sectional case control study in the outpatient department of the endocrine clinic over 18 months. In total, 41 brothers and 35 sisters of women with PCOS (diagnosed by 2003 Rotterdam criteria) were recruited.Age (±2 years), sex and BMI- (±1 kg/) matched controls were selected. Cases and controls underwent clinical and biochemical investigations. Cardiologists performed doppler ultrasonogram to determine CIMT and FMD in a blinded fashion.FMD was decreased in brothers [median 12.3% interquartile range (5.1, 19) versus 18.4% (12.6, 21.5), P = 0.002] and in sisters [10.8% (5.8, 17.2) versus 14.7% (11.4, 18.2), P = 0.027] when compared to controls. CIMT was higher in sisters [median 0.4 mm (0.35, 0.5) versus 0.3 mm (0.3, 0.4), P= 0.002] when compared to controls but not in brothers. Metabolic syndrome was more common in brothers (27% versus 5% in controls, P = 0.007) even after matching for age and BMI.  (homeostatic model assessment for  and acanthosis) was higher in brothers as compared to controls. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate was significantly elevated in brothers.There may have been referral bias of patients with PCOS in a tertiary care institute, and the radiological assessment was performed by two cardiologists serially on different time frames over the study duration. Power was only 50% in CIMT for brothers.Siblings of women with PCOS had higher CVD risk over and above the already pre-existing higher metabolic risk associated with Asian Indian ethnicity and therefore the siblings require vigilant management. Endothelial dysfunction and  seems to be a heritable trait of PCOS independent of obesity, which if confirmed in other ethnicities would have important implications.Funded by Intramural Research Grant (PGI/DIR/RC/943/2013) from the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences.

It worsens lipid induced inflammation and . Here we demonstrate that a small molecule, a peroxyvanadate compound i.e. DmpzH [VO(O) (dmpz)] or dmp, could robustly decrease macrophage infiltration, accumulation and their polarization in high fat diet (HFD) induced obese diabetic mice. In searching the underlying mechanism it was revealed that SIRT1 level was strikingly low in the inflamed adipose tissue of HFD mice as compared to mice fed with standard diet (SD). Administration of dmp markedly increased SIRT1 level by inducing its gene expression with a consequent decrease in macrophage population. Elevation of SIRT1 coincided with the decrease of MCP1, Fetuin-A (FetA) and IFNγ. Since MCP1 and FetA drive macrophage to inflamed adipose tissue and IFNγ promotes  to M1 transformation, both recruitment and M1 induced inflammation were found to be significantly repressed by dmp. In addressing the question about how dmp induced excess SIRT1 could reduce MCP1, FetA and IFNγ levels, we found that it was due to the inactivation of NFκB because of its deacetylation by SIRT1. Since NFκB is the transcriptional regulator of these molecules, their expressions were significantly suppressed and that caused sharp decline in macrophage recruitment and their polarity to M1. This effected a marked fall in proinflammatory cytokine level which significantly improved  sensitivity. dmp is likely to be the first molecule that rescues inflammatory burden contributed by macrophage in obese diabetic mice adipose tissue which causes significant increase in  sensitivity therefore it may be a meaningful choice to treat type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In lean/non-lean group, any amount of weight reduction, ≥ 5% weight reduction and ≥ 7% weight reduction was found in respectively 8/11, 5/6 and 2/6 patients. In both lean and non-lean groups, weight reduction of any amount was associated with significant reduction of steatosis, ballooning and NAS, except lobular inflammation and fibrosis. In both groups, weight reduction of ≥ 5% was associated with significant reduction in NAS only. However, significant improvement in NAS was noted with ≥ 7% weight reduction in non-lean group only.Smaller amount of weight reduction had the good benefit of improvement in all the segments of histological activity in both lean and non-lean NASH.© 2019 Shahinul Alam, Mohammad Jahid Hasan, Md.

Adipose tissue macrophages are associated with glucose homeostasis and  in type 2 diabetes and obesity in humans, offering a potential target for therapeutics. However, whether transplantation of autologous adipose tissue that changes the macrophage phenotype directly contributes to systemic glucose intolerance has not been determined. We specifically developed our device, with more refined wavelengths of light to activate the macrophage phenotype in isolated subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) from host HFD mice. Autologous transplantation of photoactivated sWAT into HFD mice significantly reverses the M1 macrophage phenotype into , reduces the infiltration of macrophages in adipose tissues of HFD mice, and decreases the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Strikingly, this transplantation reduced blood glucose levels and caused significant improvement in glucose tolerance, which was not shown in sham-operated or nonphotoactivated sWAT-transplanted HFD mice. Moreover, positron emission/computed tomography scans indicated higher glucose uptake in the heart but not in the liver, hindlimb muscles, or abdominal sWAT. These data suggested that the ability of photoactivation to shift Adipose tissue macrophage polarization in HFD mice caused a significant improvement in glucose homeostasis and that autologous transplantation might be a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of diabetes.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29746485>Adiponectin and the steatosis marker Chi3L1 decrease following switch to raltegravir compared to continued PI/NNRTI-based antiretroviral therapy.</a></h2><p>People with HIV are at for metabolic syndrome (MetS) and fatty liver disease, but the role of Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is poorly understood. MetS and fatty liver disease been associated with changes in adiponectin, soluble ST2 (sST2), chitinase 3-like 1 (Chi3L1), hyaluronic acid (HA), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), lysyl oxidase-like-2 (LOXL2) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) concentrations in HIV-uninfected populations. Protease (PI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) may contribute to these comorbidities, but the effects of switching from PI- or NNRTI to raltegravir (RAL) on these biomarkers is unknown.Cryopreserved plasma was obtained from a completed, prospective trial of HIV-infected women with central adiposity on NNRTI- or PI-based ART during which they were randomized to remain on their current ART or switch to a RAL based regimen. Biomarker concentrations were quantified using ELISA and Multiplex assays at baseline and 24 weeks after randomization. Wilcoxon-signed rank test evaluated within-group changes, Spearman and linear regression models evaluated correlations between biomarkers and clinical covariates.Participants had a median age of 43 years, CD4+ T lymphocyte count 558 cells/mm3 and BMI 32 kg/; 35% met criteria for MetS. At baseline, higher adiponectin levels correlated with higher Chi3L1 levels (r = 0.42, p = 0.02), as did declines after 24 weeks (r = 0.40, p = 0.03). Changes in sST2 correlated with changes in Chi3L1 (r = 0.43, p = 0.02) and adiponectin (r = 0.40, p = 0.03). Adiponectin and Chi3L1 levels decreased significantly in women switched to RAL vs continue PI/NNRTI.In women with HIV and central obesity, the hepatic steatosis/fibrosis marker Chi3L1 and adiponectin decrease in conjunction with sST2 decreases following switch to RAL. Whether switching from NNRTI/PI-based regimens to RAL can improve hepatic steatosis and dysmetabolism requires further study.Clinicaltrials.gov .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968941>Effects of tai chi on physiology, balance and quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>To systematically synthesize and critically evaluate evidence on the effects of tai chi for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.Seven electronic databases (Wan Fang, SinoMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library) were systematically searched from their inception to March 2018.Randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of tai chi on individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus were eligible.Biomedical outcomes (fasting plasma glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting , , body mass index, total cholesterol, blood pressure) as well as balance and quality of life-related outcomes were extracted independently by 2 reviewers. Stata 12.0 software was used to synthesize data if there was no or moderate heterogeneity across studies. Otherwise, narrative summaries were performed.A total of 23 studies (25 articles) involving 1,235 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Significant changes in tai chi-related effects were observed in lowering fasting plasma glucose (standardized mean difference; SMD -0.67; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) -0.87 to -0.47; p <0.001), HbA1c (mean difference; MD-0.88%; 95% CI -1.45% to -0.31%; p =0.002) and  (MD -0.41; 95% CI -0.78 to -0.04; p = 0.029). Beneficial effects of tai chi were also found in decreasing body mass index (MD -0.82 kg/; 95% CI -1.28 to -0.37 kg/; p < 0.001) and total cholesterol (SMD -0.59; 95% CI -0.90 to -0.27; p < 0.001). In addition, tai chi reduced blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (MD -10.03 mmHg; 95% CI -15.78 to -4.29 mmHg; p = 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (MD -4.85 mmHg; 95% CI -8.23 to -1.47 mmHg; p = 0.005)) and improved quality of life-related outcomes (physical function (MD 7.07; 95% CI 0.79-13.35; p = 0.027), bodily pain (MD 4.30; 95% CI 0.83-7.77; p = 0.015) and social function (MD 13.84; 95% CI 6.22-21.47; p < 0.001)). However, no impact was exerted on fasting  (SMD -0.32; 95% CI -0.71 to 0.07; p = 0.110) or balance (MD 2.71 s; 95% CI -3.29 to 8.71 s; p = 0.376).Tai chi is effective in controlling biomedical outcomes and improving quality of life-related outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus, although no effects were observed on balance and fasting . Further high-quality research is needed to elucidate the effects of different types of tai chi, the long-term effects of tai chi, the impact on respiratory function, and the association between tai chi and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus in healthy individuals.</p></html>
