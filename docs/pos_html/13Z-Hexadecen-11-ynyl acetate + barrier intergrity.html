This study was aimed to investigate the changes of intestinal microbiota and  function in burned mice to further comprehend the mechanisms of burn-induced intestinal  dysfunction.Samples were from mice inflicted with 30% total body surface area (TBSA) full-thickness burns. The intestinal permeability, tight junction proteins expressions, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) localization, inflammatory cytokines expressions, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) contents were determined. The microbial community was assessed via 16S rDNA Illumina sequencing.The intestinal permeability was increased after severe burn injury, peaking at 6 h post-burn, with approximately 20-folds of the control ( < 0.001). The expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1, and claudin-2) was significantly altered ( < 0.05). The ZO-1 morphology was dramatically changed following burn injury. The fecal SCFAs' contents (, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate) were noticeably declined after burn injury ( < 0.05). The expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6) in ileal mucosa were increased, whereas the expressions of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) were decreased following burn injury ( < 0.05). In addition, burned mice showed an alteration of intestinal microbial community, such as decreased diversity, reduced  abundance, and increased  abundance.The severe burn-induced intestinal  dysfunction is along with the alterations of microbial community.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26297475>High levels of fish oil enhance neutrophil development and activation and influence colon mucus   in a genetically susceptible mouse model.</a></h2><p>Dietary fatty acids influence immunologic homeostasis, but their effect on initiation of colitis, an immune-mediated disease, is not well established. Previously, our laboratory demonstrated that high doses of dietary fish oil (FO) increased colon inflammation and dysplasia in a model of infection-induced colitis. In the current study, we assessed the effects of high-dose dietary FO, 6% by weight, on colon inflammation, neutrophil recruitment and , and mucus layer integrity in a genetically susceptible, colitis-prone mouse model in the absence of infection. FO-fed SMAD3(-/-) mice had increased colon inflammation evidenced by increased numbers of systemic and local neutrophils and increased neutrophil chemoattractant and inflammatory cytokine gene expression in the colon. Mucus layer thickness in the cecum and goblet cell numbers in the cecum and colon in FO-fed mice were reduced compared to control. FO consumption affected colitis in male and female mice differently. Compared to female control mice, neutrophils from FO-fed female mice had reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon ex vivo stimulation with phorbol myristate  while FO-fed male mice produced increased ROS compared to control-fed male mice. In summary, dietary FO impaired mucus layer integrity and was associated with colon inflammation characterized by increased neutrophil numbers and altered neutrophil . High-dose FO may have detrimental effects in populations genetically susceptible for inflammatory bowel disease and these effects may differ between males and females.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) detoxifies acetaldehyde into . Subpopulations of Asians and Native Americans show polymorphism with loss-of- mutations in ALDH2. We evaluated the effect of ALDH2 deficiency on EtOH-induced disruption of intestinal epithelial tight junctions and adherens junctions, gut  dysfunction, and liver injury.Wild-type and ALDH2-deficient mice were fed EtOH (1 to 6%) in Lieber-DeCarli diet for 4 weeks. Gut permeability in vivo was measured by plasma-to-luminal flux of FITC-inulin, tight junction and adherens junction integrity was analyzed by confocal microscopy, and liver injury was assessed by the analysis of plasma transaminase activity, histopathology, and liver triglyceride.EtOH feeding elevated colonic mucosal acetaldehyde, which was significantly greater in ALDH2-deficient mice. ALDH2(-/-) mice showed a drastic reduction in the EtOH diet intake. Therefore, this study was continued only in wild-type and ALDH2(+/-) mice. EtOH feeding elevated mucosal inulin permeability in distal colon, but not in proximal colon, ileum, or jejunum of wild-type mice. In ALDH2(+/-) mice, EtOH-induced inulin permeability in distal colon was not only higher than that in wild-type mice, but inulin permeability was also elevated in the proximal colon, ileum, and jejunum. Greater inulin permeability in distal colon of ALDH2(+/-) mice was associated with a more severe redistribution of tight junction and adherens junction proteins from the intercellular junctions. In ALDH2(+/-) mice, but not in wild-type mice, EtOH feeding caused a loss of junctional distribution of tight junction and adherens junction proteins in the ileum. Histopathology, plasma transaminases, and liver triglyceride analyses showed that EtOH-induced liver damage was significantly greater in ALDH2(+/-) mice compared to wild-type mice.These data demonstrate that ALDH2 deficiency enhances EtOH-induced disruption of intestinal epithelial tight junctions,  dysfunction, and liver damage.Copyright © 2015 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27787408>Chronic Psychosocial Stress and Gut Health in Children: Associations With Calprotectin and Fecal Short-Chain Fatty Acids.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms underpinning the association between chronic stress and gut health are poorly understood. We aimed to investigate the relationship between bacterial produced short-chain fatty acids, gut  function, and stress measures.A fecal sample, hair sample, and questionnaire data were collected from 113 Belgian children (8-16 years old). Biological measures of stress included hair cortisol (most proximal 3 cm) and 5-minute heart rate variability (high frequency). Self-report measures of stress included emotional problems and negative events. Fecal calprotectin was determined as a marker of intestinal inflammation and an indirect indicator of gut  . Fecal short-chain fatty acids (butyrate, propionate, , valerate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate) were measured with gas chromatography. Linear regression analyses were adjusted for sex, age, socioeconomic status, body mass index, fiber intake, and protein intake.Emotional problems were significantly associated with higher butyrate (β = 0.263), valerate (β = 0.230), isovalerate (β = 0.231), and isobutyrate (β = 0.233). Heart rate variability reflecting higher parasympathetic activity was related to lower valerate levels (β = -0.217). Hair cortisol was not associated with the short-chain fatty acids. None of the stress measures and none of the fecal short-chain fatty acids were significantly related to fecal calprotectin.In healthy children, the impact of chronic stress is manifested more obviously in short-chain fatty acids than in intestinal inflammation as measured by levels of calprotectin. Despite the rather counterintuitive associations with butyrate, these results point to the need for further research on gut microbiome composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30561288>Gut microbiota and health: connecting actors across the metabolic system.</a></h2><p>Overweight-related metabolic diseases are an important threat to health in the Western world. Dietary habits are one of the main causative factors for metabolic syndrome, CVD and type 2 diabetes. The human gut microbiota is emerging as an important player in the interaction between diet and metabolic health. Gut microbial communities contribute to human metabolism through fermentation of dietary fibre and the result of intestinal saccharolytic fermentation is production of SCFA. , propionate and butyrate positively influence satiety, endocrine system, glucose homeostasis, adipogenesis, lipid oxidation, thermoregulation, hepatic gluconeogenesis, endothelial function and gut  , and these mechanisms have all been linked to protection from type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular health. The gut microbiota is also involved in bile acid metabolism and regulating their cell signalling potential, which has also been shown to modify pathways involved in metabolic health. Similarly, the gut microbiota renders recalcitrant plant polyphenols into biologically active small phenolic compounds which then act systemically to reduce metabolic disease risk. This review summarises how dietary patterns, specific foods and a healthy lifestyle may modulate metabolic health through the gut microbiota and their molecular cross-talk with the host.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28134251>Low-dose acetaminophen induces early disruption of cell-cell tight junctions in human hepatic cells and mouse liver.</a></h2><p>Dysfunction of cell-cell tight junction (TJ) adhesions is a major feature in the pathogenesis of various diseases. Liver TJs preserve cellular polarity by delimiting functional bile-canalicular structures, forming the blood-biliary . In acetaminophen-hepatotoxicity, the mechanism by which tissue cohesion and polarity are affected remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that acetaminophen, even at low-dose, disrupts the  of TJ and cell-matrix adhesions, with indicators of cellular stress with liver injury in the human hepatic HepaRG cell line, and primary hepatocytes. In mouse liver, at human-equivalence (therapeutic) doses, dose-dependent loss of intercellular hepatic TJ-associated ZO-1 protein expression was evident with progressive clinical signs of liver injury. Temporal, dose-dependent and specific disruption of the TJ-associated ZO-1 and cytoskeletal-F-actin proteins, correlated with modulation of hepatic ultrastructure. Real-time impedance biosensing verified in vitro early, dose-dependent quantitative decreases in TJ and cell-substrate adhesions. Whereas treatment with NAPQI, the reactive metabolite of acetaminophen, or the PKCα-activator and TJ-disruptor phorbol-12-myristate-13-, similarly reduced TJ , which may implicate oxidative stress and the PKC pathway in TJ destabilization. These findings are relevant to the clinical presentation of acetaminophen-hepatotoxicity and may inform future mechanistic studies to identify specific molecular targets and pathways that may be altered in acetaminophen-induced hepatic depolarization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29928110>Theaflavin alleviates inflammatory response and brain injury induced by cerebral hemorrhage via inhibiting the nuclear transcription factor kappa β-related pathway in rats.</a></h2><p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is one of the most common acute cerebrovascular diseases with high mortality. Numerous studies have shown that inflammatory response played an important role in ICH-induced brain injury. Theaflavin (TF) extracted from black tea has various biological functions including anti-inflammatory activity. In this study, we investigated whether TF could inhibit ICH-induced inflammatory response in rats and explored its mechanism.ICH rat models were induced with type VII collagenase and pretreated with TF by gavage in different doses (25 mg/kg-100 mg/kg). Twenty-four hours after ICH attack, we evaluated the rats' behavioral performance, the blood-brain  (BBB) , and the formation of cerebral edema. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines were examined by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Nissl staining and transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) were aimed to detect the neuron loss and apoptosis, the mechanism of which was explored by Western blot.It was found that in the pretreated ICH rats TF significantly alleviated the behavioral defects, protected BBB , and decreased the formation of cerebral edema and the levels of ROS as well as inflammatory cytokines (including interleukin-1 beta [IL-1β], IL-18, tumor nectosis factor-alpha, interferon-γ, transforming growth factor beta, and (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 [CXCL1]). Nissl staining and TUNEL displayed TF could protect against the neuron loss and apoptosis via inhibiting the activation of nuclear transcription factor kappa-β-p65 (NF-κβ-p65), caspase-1, and IL-1β. We also found that phorbol 12-myristate 13-, a nonspecific activator of NF-κβ-p65, weakened the positive effect of TF on ICH-induced neural defects and neuron apoptosis by upregulating NF-κβ-related signaling pathway.TF could alleviate ICH-induced inflammatory responses and brain injury in rats via inhibiting NF-κβ-related pathway, which may provide a new way for the therapy of ICH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31058160>The Effects of Vegetarian and Vegan Diets on Gut Microbiota.</a></h2><p>The difference in gut microbiota composition between individuals following vegan or vegetarian diets and those following omnivorous diets is well documented. A plant-based diet appears to be beneficial for human health by promoting the development of more diverse and stable microbial systems. Additionally, vegans and vegetarians have significantly higher counts of certain -related operational taxonomic units compared to omnivores. Fibers (that is, non-digestible carbohydrates, found exclusively in plants) most consistently increase lactic acid bacteria, such as , and , and reduce  and  species. Polyphenols, also abundant in plant foods, increase  and , which provide anti-pathogenic and anti-inflammatory effects and cardiovascular protection. High fiber intake also encourages the growth of species that ferment fiber into metabolites as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including , propionate, and butyrate. The positive health effects of SCFAs are myriad, including improved immunity against pathogens, blood-brain  , provision of energy substrates, and regulation of critical functions of the intestine. In conclusion, the available literature suggests that a vegetarian/vegan diet is effective in promoting a diverse ecosystem of beneficial bacteria to support both human gut microbiome and overall health. This review will focus on effects of different diets and nutrient contents, particularly plant-based diets, on the gut microbiota composition and production of microbial metabolites affecting the host health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26280221>Novel regenerative peptide TP508 mitigates radiation-induced gastrointestinal damage by activating stem cells and preserving crypt integrity.</a></h2><p>In recent years, increasing threats of radiation exposure and nuclear disasters have become a significant concern for the United States and countries worldwide. Exposure to high doses of radiation triggers a number of potentially lethal effects. Among the most severe is the gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity syndrome caused by the destruction of the intestinal , resulting in bacterial translocation, systemic bacteremia, sepsis, and death. The lack of effective radioprotective agents capable of mitigating radiation-induced damage has prompted a search for novel countermeasures that can mitigate the effects of radiation post exposure, accelerate tissue repair in radiation-exposed individuals, and prevent mortality. We report that a single injection of regenerative peptide TP508 (rusalatide , Chrysalin) 24 h after lethal radiation exposure (9 Gy, LD100/15) appears to significantly increase survival and delay mortality by mitigating radiation-induced intestinal and colonic toxicity. TP508 treatment post exposure prevents the disintegration of GI crypts, stimulates the expression of adherens junction protein E-cadherin, activates crypt cell proliferation, and decreases apoptosis. TP508 post-exposure treatment also upregulates the expression of DCLK1 and LGR5 markers of stem cells that have been shown to be responsible for maintaining and regenerating intestinal crypts. Thus, TP508 appears to mitigate the effects of GI toxicity by activating radioresistant stem cells and increasing the stemness potential of crypts to maintain and restore intestinal integrity. These results suggest that TP508 may be an effective emergency nuclear countermeasure that could be delivered within 24 h post exposure to increase survival and delay mortality, giving victims time to reach clinical sites for advanced medical treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546582>Protective Effect of Probiotic Bacteria and Estrogen in Preventing HIV-1-Mediated Impairment of Epithelial   in Female Genital Tract.</a></h2><p>Approximately 40% of global HIV-1 transmission occurs in the female genital tract (FGT) through heterosexual transmission. Epithelial cells lining the FGT provide the first  to HIV-1 entry. Previous studies have suggested that certain hormonal contraceptives or a dysbiosis of the vaginal microbiota can enhance HIV-1 acquisition in the FGT. We examined the effects of lactobacilli and female sex hormones on the  functions and innate immune responses of primary endometrial genital epithelial cells (GECs). Two probiotic strains,  RC-14 and  GR-1, were tested, as were sex hormones estrogen (E2), progesterone (P4), and the hormonal contraceptive medroxyprogesterone  (MPA). Our results demonstrate that probiotic lactobacilli enhance  function without affecting cytokines. Treatment of GECs with MPA resulted in reduced  function. In contrast, E2 treatment enhanced  function and reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines. Comparison of hormones plus lactobacilli as a pre-treatment prior to HIV exposure revealed a dominant effect of lactobacilli in preventing loss of  function by GECs. In summary, the combination of E2 and lactobacilli had the best protective effect against HIV-1 seen by enhancement of  function and reduction in proinflammatory cytokines. These studies provide insights into how probiotic lactobacilli in the female genital microenvironment can alter HIV-1-mediated  disruption and how the combination of E2 and lactobacilli may decrease susceptibility to primary HIV infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28804104>α-Cyperone Inhibits PMA-Induced EPCR Shedding through PKC Pathway.</a></h2><p>α-Cyperone, a sesquiterpene compound represents 25.23% of the total oil and is the most abundant compound in Cyperus rotundus oil. Endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR) is a main member in protein C (PC) anti-coagulation system. EPCR could be shed from cell surface, and is mediated by tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (TACE). Nothing that EPCR is a marker of vascular   in vascular inflammatory disease and takes part in systemic inflammatory disease. In this study, we investigated whether α-cyperone could inhibit EPCR shedding. To observe the effect, we investigated this issue by detection the effect of α-cyperone on phorbol-12-myristate 13- (PMA)-induced EPCR shedding in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The cells were pretreated with α-cyperone for 12 h, and then stimulated by PMA for 1 h. The solute EPCR (sEPCR) and expression of membrane EPCR (mEPCR) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot. The mRNA, protein level and activity of TACE were tested by quantitative (q)RT-PCR, Western blot and InnoZyme TACE activity assay kit. Furthermore, we measured the protein level of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and protein kinase C (PKC) pathway under this condition by Western blot. The results showed that α-cyperone could suppress PMA-induced EPCR shedding through inhibiting the expression and activity of TACE. In addition, α-cyperone could inhibit PKC translocation, but not have an effect on phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 and extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) 1/2. Given these results, α-cyperone inhibits PMA-induced EPCR shedding through PKC pathway, which will provide an experimental basis for further research on α-cyperone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637713>Podosome formation impairs endothelial  function by sequestering zonula occludens proteins.</a></h2><p>Podosomes and tight junctions (TJs) are subcellular compartments that both exist in endothelial cells and localize at cell surfaces. In contrast to the well-characterized role of TJs in maintaining cerebrovascular , the specific function of endothelial podosomes remains unknown. Intriguingly, we discovered cross-talk between podosomes and TJs in human brain endothelial cells. Tight junction scaffold proteins ZO-1 and ZO-2 localize at podosomes in response to phorbol-12-myristate-13- treatment. We found that both ZO proteins are essential for podosome formation and function. Rather than being derived from new protein synthesis, podosomal ZO-1 and ZO-2 are relocated from a pre-existing pool found at the peripheral plasma membrane with enhanced physical interaction with cortactin, a known protein marker for podosomes. Sequestration of ZO proteins in podosomes weakens tight junction complex formation, leading to increased endothelial cell permeability. This effect can be further attenuated by podosome inhibitor PP2. Altogether, our data revealed a novel cellular function of podosomes, specifically, their ability to negatively regulate tight junction and endothelial  , which have been linked to a variety of cerebrovascular diseases.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26234796>Role of the heme oxygenase-adiponectin-atrial natriuretic peptide axis in renal .</a></h2><p>The incidence of renal complications including kidney failure is on the rise. Moreover, with aging of the population and the high incidence of diabetes, hypertension and obesity, this trend may prevail. An important cytoprotective enzyme that has been shown to improve renal  is heme-oxygenase (HO). HO is known to abate apoptosis and necrosis, and improves cell vitality, which in turn, may enhance tissue regeneration. Consistently, HO has been shown to restore tissue morphology by potentiating potentiate proteins of repair/regeneration and promoting neovascularization. The formation of new tissue may replace damaged or dysfunctional tissue to preserve cellular integrity and  after injury. Emerging evidence indicate that HO-inducers improve kidney  in several models including, (i) streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, (ii) Zucker-diabetic-fatty rats, (iii) Zucker-fatty rats, (iii) spontaneously hypertensive rats, (iv) uninephrectomized deoxycorticosterone- hypertensive rats, (v) N(ω)-nitro-l-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME)-induced hypertensive rats, (vi) glycerol induced renal failure, (vii) nephrotoxic nephritis, (viii) sepsis-induced kidney injury, (ix) cystic renal disease, (x) cisplatin-mediated acute kidney injury, and (xi) rhabdomyolysis-induced renal injury. The mechanisms underlying the HO-mediated reno-protection include: (i) the restoration of renal morphology by enhancing proteins of regeneration, (ii) the potentiation of the HO-adiponectin-atrial natriuretic peptide axis, with corresponding suppression of oxidative/inflammatory insults and extracellular matrix/profibrotic factors, and (iii) the potentiation of podocyte cytoskeletal proteins such as nephrin, podocin, podocalyxin and CD2-associated-protein, which are fundamental for forming the glomerular filtration  that selectively allows small molecules to pass through but not large protein molecules. Thus, this review highlights the HO-adiponectin-atrial natriuretic peptide axis in renoprotection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28148966>Endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibition attenuates hypertensive chronic kidney disease through reduction in proteinuria.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is implicated in chronic kidney disease (CKD) development in patients and in animal models. Here we show that ER stress inhibition through 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) administration decreases blood pressure, albuminuria, and tubular casts in an angiotensin II/deoxycorticosterone /salt murine model of CKD. Lower albuminuria in 4-PBA-treated mice was associated with higher levels of cubilin protein in renal tissue membrane fractions. 4-PBA decreased renal interstitial fibrosis, renal CD3 T-cell and macrophage infiltration, mRNA expression of TGFβ1, Wnt signaling molecules, and ER stress-induced pro-inflammatory genes. CHOP deficient mice that underwent this model of CKD developed hypertension comparable to wild type mice, but had less albuminuria and tubular casts. CHOP deficiency resulted in higher nephrin levels and decreased glomerulosclerosis compared to wild type mice; this effect was accompanied by lower macrophage infiltration and fibrosis. Our findings portray ER stress inhibition as a means to alleviate hypertensive CKD by preserving glomerular   and tubular function. These results demonstrate ER stress modulation as a novel target for preserving renal function in hypertensive CKD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29019369>In situ generation of layered single- or double-hydroxide inorganic platelets (LSH and LDH) assisted by bola amphiphiles.</a></h2><p>A novel preparation route for layered hydroxide based hybrid phases has been investigated combining the polyol route with the in situ generation of inorganic platelets, in the presence of an amphiphilic polymer as well as bola-amphiphiles. The polyol route consists of hydrolysis in an alcoholic medium containing  metal cations as precursor(s), to yield an LDH ZnAl cation composition or LSH-Zn (layered single hydroxide). A bola amphiphile is described as hydrophobic polymer segment-telechelic-chains terminated by two anionic hydrophilic end groups, using volatile ammonium cations as counter ions. The impact of both process conditions as well as the chosen system with regard to the metal hydroxide framework on the morphology of the obtained hybrid phases is scrutinized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and compared to that of the corresponding physical mixture. For the ex situ approach, the diffusion of large cumbersome polymers or amphiphilic bolas between the inorganic platelets was found to be efficient, mostly driven by an anion exchange reaction between interleaved  anions and carboxylate functions of the molecular backbones, and keeping intact the inner sheet  through a topotactic process. In particular with LSH-Zn, a multi-stratified assembly has been observed combining an  pristine structure and a partly bola diffused structure, leading to a biphasic structure, aggregated and intercalated. To the best of our knowledge, observation of LSH-Zn single platelets has never been reported, making the combined process polyol/in situ an interesting new route to reach exfoliation. Indeed, it leads to the generation of either LSH or LDH platelets of lateral size ranging from 10 up to 200 nm. However, the platelets were found to be porous; it is considered as a drawback for  properties. It is our belief that such porosity may open new insights in "tectonic" architecture by intertwining 2D and 1D-type fillers. Rather counterintuitively, the ex situ approach based on a topotactic exchange reaction matches the in situ templating reaction in many cases as a function of the dispersion state regardless of the polymer or bolas as well as the platelet cation composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25841250>White and dark kidney beans reduce colonic mucosal damage and inflammation in response to dextran sodium sulfate.</a></h2><p>Common beans are a rich source of nondigestible fermentable components and phenolic compounds that have anti-inflammatory effects. We assessed the gut-health-promoting potential of kidney beans in healthy mice and their ability to attenuate colonic inflammation following dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) exposure (via drinking water, 2% DSS w/v, 7 days). C57BL/6 mice were fed one of three isocaloric diets: basal diet control (BD), or BD supplemented with 20% cooked white (WK) or dark red kidney (DK) bean flour for 3 weeks. In healthy mice, anti-inflammatory microbial-derived cecal short chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels (, butyrate and propionate), colon crypt height and colonic Mucin 1 (MUC1) and Resistin-like Molecule beta (Relmβ) mRNA expression all increased in WK- and DK-fed mice compared to BD, indicative of enhanced microbial activity, gut  integrity and antimicrobial defense response. During colitis, both bean diets reduced (a) disease severity, (b) colonic histological damage and (c) increased mRNA expression of antimicrobial and  integrity-promoting genes (Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4), MUC1-3, Relmβ and Trefoil Factor 3 (TFF3)) and reduced proinflammatory mediator expression [interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, interferon (IFN)γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1], which correlated with reduced colon tissue protein levels. Further, bean diets exerted a systemic anti-inflammatory effect during colitis by reducing serum levels of IL-17A, IFNγ, TNFα, IL-1β and IL-6. In conclusion, both WK and DK bean-supplemented diets enhanced microbial-derived SCFA metabolite production, gut  integrity and the microbial defensive response in the healthy colon, which supported an anti-inflammatory phenotype during colitis. Collectively, these data demonstrate a beneficial colon- priming effect of bean consumption that mitigates colitis severity.Crown Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Cholesterol and its derivatives control epidermal  integrity and are protective against environmental insults. To determine the role of the gene in skin cholesterol homeostasis, we applied 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA) to the skin of Tm7sf2(+/+) and Tm7sf2(-/-) mice. TPA increased skin cholesterol levels by inducing de novo synthesis and up-take only in Tm7sf2(+/+) mouse, confirming that the gene maintains cholesterol homeostasis under stress conditions. Cholesterol sulfate, one of the major players in skin permeability, was doubled by TPA treatment in the skin of wild-type animals but this response was lost in Tm7sf2(-/-) mice. The expression of markers of epidermal differentiation concomitant with farnesoid-X-receptor and p38 MAPK activation were also disrupted in Tm7sf2(-/-) mice. We then subjected Tm7sf2(+/+) and Tm7sf2(-/-) mice to a classical two-stage skin carcinogenesis protocol. We found that the loss of Tm7sf2 increased incidence and multiplicity of skin papillomas. Interestingly, the null genotype showed reduced expression of nur77, a gene associated with resistance to neoplastic transformation. In conclusion, the loss of Tm7sf2 alters the expression of proteins involved in epidermal differentiation by reducing the levels of cholesterol sulfate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30222141>Use of contraceptive depot medroxyprogesterone  is associated with impaired cervicovaginal mucosal .</a></h2><p>Injectable depot medroxyprogesterone  (DMPA) is one of the most popular contraception methods in areas of high HIV seroprevalence. Evidence is accumulating that use of DMPA might be associated with an increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition by women; however, mechanisms of this association are not completely understood. The goal of this study was to gain insight into mechanisms underlying the possible link between use of DMPA and risk of HIV-1 acquisition, exploring transcription profiling of ectocervical tissues.Healthy women received either DMPA (n = 31) or combined oral contraceptive (COC), which has not been linked to an increased risk of HIV acquisition (n = 32). We conducted a comparative microarray-based whole-genome transcriptome profiling of human ectocervical tissues before and after 6 weeks of hormonal contraception use.The analysis identified that expression of 235 and 76 genes was significantly altered after DMPA and COC use, respectively. The most striking effect of DMPA, but not COC, was significantly altered expression (mostly downregulation) of many genes strategically involved in the maintenance of mucosal  function; the alterations, as indicated by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), were most likely due to the DMPA-induced estrogen deficiency. Furthermore, IPA predicted that transcriptome alterations related to ectocervical immune responses were in general compatible with an immunosuppressive effect of DMPA, but, in some women, also with an inflammatory-like response.Our results suggest that impairment of cervicovaginal mucosal  in response to DMPA administration is an important mechanism contributing to the potential increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition in DMPA users.ClinicalTrials.gov .This study was supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under Cooperative Agreement GPO-A-00-08-00005-00.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28446880>Shifts in the Gut Microbiota Composition Due to Depleted Bone Marrow Beta Adrenergic Signaling Are Associated with Suppressed Inflammatory Transcriptional Networks in the Mouse Colon.</a></h2><p>The brain-gut axis plays a critical role in the regulation of different diseases, many of which are characterized by sympathetic dysregulation. However, a direct link between sympathetic dysregulation and gut dysbiosis remains to be illustrated. Bone marrow (BM)-derived immune cells continuously interact with the gut microbiota to maintain homeostasis in the host. Their function is largely dependent upon the sympathetic nervous system acting via adrenergic receptors present on the BM immune cells. In this study, we utilized a novel chimera mouse that lacks the expression of BM beta1/2 adrenergic receptors (b1/2-ARs) to investigate the role of the sympathetic drive to the BM in gut and microbiota homeostasis. Fecal analyses demonstrated a shift from a dominance of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes phylum in the b1/2-ARs KO chimera, resulting in a reduction in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. Meanwhile, a significant reduction in Proteobacteria phylum was determined. No changes in the abundance of -, butyrate-, and lactate-producing bacteria, and colon pathology were observed in the b1/2-ARs KO chimera. Transcriptomic profiling in colon identified Killer Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D, Member 1 (Klrd1), Membrane-Spanning 4-Domains Subfamily A Member 4A (Ms4a4b), and Casein Kinase 2 Alpha Prime Polypeptide (Csnk2a2) as main transcripts associated with the microbiota shifts in the b1/2-ARs KO chimera. Suppression of leukocyte-related transcriptome networks (i.e., function, differentiation, migration), classical compliment pathway, and networks associated with intestinal function,  , and excretion was also observed in the colon of the KO chimera. Moreover, reduced expression of transcriptional networks related to intestinal diseases (i.e., ileitis, enteritis, inflammatory lesions, and stress) was noted. The observed suppressed transcriptome networks were associated with a reduction in NK cells, macrophages, and CD4 T cells in the b1/2-ARs KO chimera colon. Thus, sympathetic regulation of BM-derived immune cells plays a significant role in modifying inflammatory networks in the colon and the gut microbiota composition. To our knowledge, this study is the first to suggest a key role of BM b1/2-ARs signaling in host-microbiota interactions, and reveals specific molecular mechanisms that may lead to generation of novel anti-inflammatory treatments for many immune and autonomic diseases as well as gut dysbiosis across the board.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30343040>Impact of topical corticosteroid pretreatment on susceptibility of the injured murine cornea to Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization and infection.</a></h2><p>Research with animal models of Pseudomonas aeruginosa keratitis has shown that use of a topical corticosteroid alone against an established infection can significantly increase the number of colonizing bacteria or worsen clinical disease. Moreover, retrospective analysis has suggested that corticosteroid use in humans is associated with an increased risk of keratitis in eyes with pre-existing disease. Thus, while corticosteroids are often used to reduce ocular inflammation in the absence of infection, the risk of opportunistic infection remains a concern. However, the effect of corticosteroids on the intrinsic  function of uninfected corneas is unknown. Here, we tested if short-term topical corticosteroid treatment of an uninfected murine cornea would increase susceptibility to P. aeruginosa colonization or infection after epithelial injury. Topical prednisolone  (1%) was administered to one eye of C57BL/6 mice three times a day for 3 days; control eyes were treated with sterile PBS. Prior to inoculation with a cytotoxic P. aeruginosa corneal isolate strain 6206, corneas were subject to superficial-injury by tissue paper blotting, or scratch-injured followed by 12 h of healing. Previously we have shown that blotting renders mouse corneas susceptible to P. aeruginosa adhesion, but not infection, while 12 h healing reduces susceptibility to infection after scratching. Corneas were evaluated at 48 h for bacterial colonization and microbial keratitis (MK). To monitor impact on wound healing, corneal  was examined by fluorescein staining immediately after scarification and after 12 h healing. For both the tissue paper blotting and scratch-injury models, there was no significant difference in P. aeruginosa colonization at 48 h between corticosteroid-pretreated eyes and controls. With the blotting model, one case of MK was observed in a control (PBS-pretreated) cornea; none in corticosteroid-pretreated corneas. With the 12 h healing model, MK occurred in 6 of 17 corticosteroid-pretreated eyes versus 2 of 17 controls, a difference not statistically significant. Corticosteroid-pretreated eyes showed greater fluorescein staining 12 h after scarification injury, but this did not coincide with increased colonization or MK. Together, these data show that short-term topical corticosteroid therapy on an uninfected murine cornea does not necessarily enhance its susceptibility to P. aeruginosa colonization or infection after injury, even when it induces fluorescein staining.Copyright © 2018.
