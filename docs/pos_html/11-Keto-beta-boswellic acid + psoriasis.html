Natural compounds with biological activities are good tools to identify new targets with therapeutic potentials. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) is the most bioactive ingredient of boswellic acids, a group of compounds with anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. Target identification of AKBA and metabolomics analysis of  helped to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying its effect, and provide new target(s) to treat the disease.To explore the targets and molecular mechanism of AKBA, we performed affinity purification, metabolomics analysis of HaCaT cells treated with AKBA, and epidermis of imiquimod (IMQ) induced mouse model of  and  patients.AKBA directly interacts with methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A), inhibited its enzyme activity, decreased level of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and SAM/SAH ratio, and reprogrammed one‑carbon metabolism in HaCaT cells. Untargeted metabolomics of epidermis showed one‑carbon metabolism was activated in  patients. Topical use of AKBA improved inflammatory phenotype of IMQ induced -like mouse model. Molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis revealed AKBA bound to an allosteric site at the interface of MAT2A dimer.Our study extends the molecular mechanism of AKBA by revealing a new interacting protein MAT2A. And this leads us to find out the dysregulated one‑carbon metabolism in , which indicates the therapeutic potential of AKBA in .

This study aimed to investigate the effects of acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) on activated dendritic cells (DCs) using an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced -like mouse model and murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) stimulated with resiquimod (R848) in vitro.The mice were treated with IMQ and intragastrically administered 25-100 mg/kg/day of AKBA, 1 mg/kg/day of methotrexate (MTX), or normal saline. The inflammation of skin lesions in IMQ mice were evaluated by  area and severity index (PASI) and pathological staining. The related proteins of Toll-like receptor (TLR)7/8 pathways were assessed using Western blotting, and the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-23 and IL-12p40 mRNA using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The numbers of DCs and marker-positive BMDCs were assessed using flow cytometry and the levels of inflammatory factors using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.AKBA and MTX obviously improved the -like skin lesions of IMQ-treated mice. AKBA also obviously decreased the PASI score, reduced the thickness of epidermis, ameliorated the infiltration of CD3+ and CD11c+ cells in skin lesions, decreased the activation of local DCs, inhibited the mRNA expression and secretion of inflammatory factors IL-12 and IL-23, inhibited the maturation and differentiation of DCs to promote T-cell differentiation, and inhibited the activation of TLR7/8 and IRF signaling pathways.This study implied that AKBA might have an anti-inflammatory effect on  by inhibiting the maturation and activation of DCs via the TLR8 and IRF signaling pathways.Copyright © 2018.
