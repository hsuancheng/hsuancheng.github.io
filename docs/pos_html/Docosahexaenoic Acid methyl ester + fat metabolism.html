<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1782799>Chemotactic activity of the peroxidized retinal membrane lipids in experimental autoimmune uveitis.</a></h2><p>We investigated the mechanism for amplification of intraocular inflammation in rats with experimental autoimmune uveitis by examining the chemotaxis potentials of peroxidized lipids extracted from the retinas. Utilizing thin layer chromatography, we found that the peroxidized products isolated from the inflamed retinas were fatty acid hydroperoxides that corresponded to the autooxidized products from commercial , with Rf values ranging from 0.30 to 0.37. These were not demonstrated in similar preparations from normal retinas or in unoxidized docosahexaenoate. Boyden chamber assay revealed that the hydroperoxides isolated from inflamed eyes and the products of oxidized  possessed significantly higher chemotactic activity than did the retinal lipids isolated from normal eyes (P less than 0.01). These findings may help to explain the mechanism of inflammatory amplification induced by peroxidized retinal lipids that is seen in this animal model of uveitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20110888>Inhibition of oxidation of aqueous emulsions of omega-3 fatty acids and fish oil by phloretin and phloridzin.</a></h2><p>The antioxidant properties of two apple dihydrochalcones, namely phloretin and phloridzin, were evaluated and compared with those of alpha-tocopherol and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). The effects were studied in an oil-in-water emulsion system containing methyl linolenate (ML), methyl eicosapentaenoate (MEPA), and  (MDHA) in which oxidation was initiated by the peroxyl radical generator 2,2-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) and in fish oil where oxidation was initiated thermally. In the emulsion system, phloretin (1 and 5 mM) completely inhibited the oxidation of ML tested as evidenced by the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay. Under the same conditions, phloridzin was less effective than phloretin, but still more effective than alpha-tocopherol. Both phloretin and phloridzin molecules had a marginal inhibitory effect against oxidation of fish oil induced by heating at 70 degrees C for 3 hours, when compared to BHT. These results indicate that phloretin and phloridzin have the potential to suppress  oxidation in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) containing foods.</p></html>
