Concentrations of drug biomarkers might be low in wastewater due to dilution; and therefore analysis of pooled urine (PU) is useful to detect consumed drugs and identify targets of illicit drugs use. The aims of the study were (1) to screen PU and urinated soil (US) samples collected at festivals for illicit drug excretion products using hyphenated techniques; (2) to develop and validate a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry / mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS) method of quantifying urinary targets of identified drugs in wastewater; and (3) to conduct a 24 h stability study, using PU and US to better reflect the chemical environment for targets in wastewater. Cocaine (COC) and ecstasy-like compounds were the most frequently detected illicit drugs; an analytical method was developed to quantify their excretion products. Hydroxymethoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), HMMA sulfate (HMMA-S), benzoylecgonine (BE), and cocaethylene (CE) had 85-102% of initial concentration after 8 h of incubation, whereas COC and ecgonine methyl ester (EME) had 74 and 67% after 8 h, respectively. HMMA showed a net increase during 24 h of incubation (107% ± 27, n = 8), possibly due to the cleavage of HMMA conjugates, and biotransformation of MDMA. The results suggest HMMA as analytical target for MDMA consumption in WBE, due to its stability in wastewater and its excretion as the main phase I metabolite of MDMA.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30850570>Serotonin syndrome unmasking thyrotoxicosis.</a></h2><p>A 26-year-old cachectic man presented with an altered mental status. He was agitated, tremulous, hyperthermic and diaphoretic with largely dilated pupils. Collateral history revealed acute ingestion of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine on a background of chronic drug abuse. His condition deteriorated requiring sedation and intubation with transfer to the intensive care unit. A diagnosis of serotonin syndrome was made, based on his findings in keeping with the Hunter criteria, and he was treated with supportive management during a resultant and briefly sustained delirium. With gradual resolution of his agitated state, further questioning and blood work a concurrent, and potentially contributory, thyrotoxicosis was revealed. The patient was commenced on treatment for this with urgent outpatient follow-up with both a local otolaryngologist and endocrinologist for consideration of further treatment.© BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2019.
