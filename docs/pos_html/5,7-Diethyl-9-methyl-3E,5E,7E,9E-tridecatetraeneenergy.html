Mechanisms for avoidance of hypervalency and for spin delocalization and spin polarization.</a></h1><p>The results are reported of an ab initio study of bromine dioxide BrO2, 1, and of the T-shaped trans- and cis-dihydroxides 2 and 3 of dihydrogen bromate (HO)2BrO. The thermochemistry has been explored of potential synthetic routes to (HO)2BrO involving water addition to BrO2, hydroxyl addition to bromous acid HOBrO, 4, protonation/reduction of bromic acid HOBrO2, , via tautomers 6-8 of protonated bromic acid, and by reduction/protonation of bromic acid via radical anion [HOBrO2](-), 9. The potential  surface analyses were performed at the MP2(full)/6-311G* level (or better) and with the consideration of aqueous solvation at the SMD(MP2(full)/6-311G*) level (or better), and higher-level energies were computed at levels up to QCISD(full,T)/6-311++G(2df,2pd)//MP2. The addition of RO radical to bromous acid or bromite esters and the reduction of protonated bromic acid or protonated bromate esters are promising leads for possible synthetic exploration. Spin density distributions and molecular electrostatic potentials were computed at the QCISD(full)/6-311G*//MP2(full)/6-311G* level to characterize the electronic structures of 1-3. Both radicals employ maximally occupied (pseudo) π-systems to transfer electron density from bromine to the periphery. While the formation of the (3c-) π-system suffices to avoid hypervalency in 1, the formation of the (4c-) π-system in 2 or 3 still leaves the bromine formally hypervalent and (HO)2BrO requires delocalization of bromine density into σ*-SMOs over the trans O-Br-O moiety. Molecular orbital theory is employed to describe the mechanisms for the avoidance of hypervalency and for spin delocalization and spin polarization. The (4c-) π-system in 2 is truly remarkable in that it contains five π-symmetric spin molecular orbitals (SMO) with unique shapes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26597855>Valence-band offset and forward-backward charge transfer in manganite/NiO and manganite/LaNiO3 heterostructures.</a></h1><p>The valence-band offset (VBO) of the La(0.67)Sr(0.33)MnO(3)/NiO (LSMO/NiO), LaMnO(3)/NiO (LMO/NiO), LSMO/LaNiO(3) (LSMO/LNO) and LMO/LaNiO(3) (LSMO/LNO) heterostructures has been investigated using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. The VBO values are calculated to be -0.72, -0.05, +1.43 and +1.51 eV for the LSMO/NiO, LSMO/LNO, LMO/LNO and LMO/NiO heterostructures, respectively. Hence, when compared with NiO and LNO, the valence band of LSMO is shifted to a lower binding , whereas that of LMO is shifted to a higher binding . In addition, the charge transfer at the interfaces has been depicted as Mn(3.3+) + 0.→ Mn(2.6+), Mn(3.3+) + 0.1e→ Mn(3.2+), Mn(3.0+)- 0.4e→ Mn(3.4+) and Mn(3.0+)- 0.→ Mn(3.+) for the LSMO/NiO, LSMO/LNO, LMO/LNO and LMO/NiO heterostructures, respectively. Thus, the charge transfer procedure can be described as electron hopping from NiO and LNO to LSMO in the LSMO/NiO and LSMO/LNO heterostructures, and electron hopping from LMO to NiO and LNO in the LMO/NiO and LSMO/LNO heterostructures. Therefore, the charge transfer is dependent on the VBO, and the charge transfer direction can be determined from the negative or positive values of the VBO.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23251661>Novel genetic loci identified for the pathophysiology of childhood obesity in the Hispanic population.</a></h1><p>Genetic variants responsible for susceptibility to obesity and its comorbidities among Hispanic children have not been identified. The VIVA LA FAMILIA Study was designed to genetically map childhood obesity and associated biological processes in the Hispanic population. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) entailed genotyping 1.1 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the Illumina Infinium technology in 815 children. Measured genotype analysis was performed between genetic markers and obesity-related traits i.e., anthropometry, body composition, growth, metabolites, hormones, inflammation, diet,  expenditure, substrate utilization and physical activity. Identified genome-wide significant loci: 1) corroborated genes implicated in other studies (MTNR1B, ZNF259/APOA5, XPA/FOXE1 (TTF-2), DARC, CCR3, ABO); 2) localized novel genes in plausible biological pathways (PCSK2, ARHGAP11A, CHRNA3); and 3) revealed novel genes with unknown function in obesity pathogenesis (MATK, COL4A1). Salient findings include a nonsynonymous SNP (rs1056513) in INADL (p = 1.2E-07) for weight; an intronic variant in MTNR1B associated with fasting glucose (p = 3.-08); variants in the APOA5-ZNF259 region associated with triglycerides (p = 2.-4.8E-08); an intronic variant in PCSK2 associated with total antioxidants (p = 7.6E-08); a block of 23 SNPs in XPA/FOXE1 (TTF-2) associated with serum TSH (p = .-08 to 1.0E-09); a nonsynonymous SNP (p = 1.3E-21), an intronic SNP (p = 3.6E-13) in DARC identified for MCP-1; an intronic variant in ARHGAP11A associated with sleep duration (p = .0E-08); and, after adjusting for body weight, variants in MATK for total  expenditure (p = 2.-08) and in CHRNA3 for sleeping  expenditure (p = 6.0E-08). Unprecedented phenotyping and high-density SNP genotyping enabled localization of novel genetic loci associated with the pathophysiology of childhood obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27146655>Properties and Corrosion Performance of Self-reinforced Composite PEEK for Proposed Use as a Modular Taper Gasket.</a></h1><p>Fretting corrosion in medical alloys is a persistent problem, and the need for biomaterials that can effectively suppress mechanically assisted crevice corrosion in modular taper junctions or otherwise insulate metal-on-metal interfaces in mechanically demanding environments is as yet unmet.The purpose of this study is to characterize a novel material, self-reinforced composite polyetheretherketone (SRC-PEEK) and to evaluate its ability to inhibit fretting corrosion in a pin-on-disk metal-on-metal interface test.SRC-PEEK was fabricated by hot compaction of in-house-made PEEK fibers by compacting uniaxial layups at 344°C under a load of 18,000 N for 10 minutes. SRC-PEEK, bulk isotropic PEEK, and the in-house-made PEEK fibers were analyzed for thermal transitions (T, T) through differential scanning calorimetry, crystallinity, crystal size, crystalline orientation (Hermanns orientation parameter) through wide-angle x-ray scattering, and modulus, tensile strength, yield stress, and strain to failure through monotonic tensile testing. SRC-insulated pin-on-disk samples were compared with metal-on-metal control samples in pin-on-disk fretting corrosion experiments using fretting current and fretting mechanics measurements. Fifty-micron cyclic motion at 2. Hz was applied to the interface, first over a range of loads (0.-35 N) while held at -0.05 V versus Ag/AgCl and then over a range of voltages (-0. to 0. V) at a constant contact stress of 73 ± 19 MPa for SRC-PEEK and 209 ± 41 MPa for metal-on-metal, which were different for each group as a result of changes in true contact area due to variations in modulus between sample groups. Pins, disks, and SRC samples were imaged for damage (on alloy and SRC surfaces) and evidence of corrosion (on alloy pin and disk surfaces). SRC specimens were analyzed for traces of alloy transferred to the surface using  dispersive spectroscopy after pin-on-disk testing.SRC-PEEK showed improved mechanical properties to bulk PEEK (modulus = .0 ± 0.3 GPa, 2.8 ± 0.1 GPa, respectively, p < 0.001) and higher crystallinity to bulk PEEK (44.2% ± 3%, 39.% ± 0.%, respectively, p = 0.039), but had comparable crystalline orientation as compared with the initial PEEK fibers. SRC-PEEK reduced fretting currents compared with metal-on-metal controls by two to three orders of magnitude in both variable load (4.0E- ± 3.8E- μA versus 2.9E-3 ± 7.1E-4 μA, respectively, p = 0.018) and variable potential (7.-6 ± 4.-6 μA versus .3E-3 ± 1.4E-3 μA, respectively, p = 0.022) fretting corrosion testing. Minimal damage was observed on surfaces insulated with SRC-PEEK, whereas control surfaces showed considerable fretting corrosion damage and metal transfer.The SRC-PEEK gaskets in this study demonstrated higher crystallinity and crystalline orientation and improved monotonic tensile properties compared with bulk PEEK with the ability to effectively insulate Ti6Al4V and CoCrMo alloy surfaces and prevent the initiation of fretting corrosion under high contact-stress conditions.This novel SRC-PEEK material may offer potential as a thin film gasket material for modular tapers. Pending further in vitro and in vivo analyses, this approach may be able to preserve the advantages of modular junctions for surgeons while potentially limiting the downside risks associated with mechanically assisted crevice corrosion.</p></html>
