<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15703384>Modulation of cellular response to cisplatin by a novel inhibitor of DNA polymerase beta.</a></h1><p>DNA polymerase beta (Pol beta) is an error-prone enzyme whose up-regulation has been shown to be a genetic instability enhancer as well as a contributor to cisplatin resistance in tumor cells. In this work, we describe the isolation of new Pol beta inhibitors after high throughput screening of 8448 semipurified natural extracts. In vitro, the selected molecules affect specifically Pol beta-mediated DNA synthesis compared with replicative extracts from cell nuclei. One of them,  (MA), is particularly attractive because it perturbs neither the activity of the purified replicative Pol delta nor that of nuclear HeLa cell extracts. With an IC50 value of 8 microM, MA is the most potent of the Pol beta inhibitors found so far. Docking simulation revealed that this molecule could substitute for single-strand DNA in the binding site of Pol beta by binding Lys35, Lys68, and Lys60, which are the main residues involved in the interaction Pol beta/single-strand DNA. Selected inhibitors also affect the Pol beta-mediated translesion synthesis (TLS) across cisplatin adducts; MA was still the most efficient. Therefore,  sensitized the cisplatin-resistant 2008C13*5.25 human tumor cells. Our data suggest that molecules such as  could be suitable in conjunction with cisplatin to enhance anticancer treatments.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11988853>Anti-inflammatory triterpenes from Pistacia terebinthus galls.</a></h1><p>From the galls of Pistacia terebinthus we obtained an extract that proved to be effective against chronic and acute . Now we report on the isolation and identification of three triterpenes: two tirucallane-type lanostanoids and one oleanane, which we have identified as  (1), masticadienolic acid (2), and morolic acid (3), respectively. All of them showed effectiveness on the mouse ear  induced by repeated applications of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate and on the phospholipase A2-induced foot paw edema. The pharmacological activity of the compounds was ratified by a histological study of the ear samples. In addition, they inhibited leukotriene B4 production in rat polymorphonuclear leukocytes stimulated with calcium ionophore A 23187.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16105229>Cytotoxic activity and effect on nitric oxide production of tirucallane-type triterpenes.</a></h1><p>Hexane extract from the bark of Amphipterygium adstringens, as well as its principal constituents,  and 3alpha-hydroxymasticadienolic acid, inhibited the growth of five human cancer cell lines. Derivatives of, namely 24,25 S-dihydromasticadienonic acid and masticadienolic acid, were also evaluated. The results showed that both and had greater activity than on colon cancer cell lines. The effects of on the production of nitric oxide (NO) from both resting and lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages were determined. It was found that and caused an increase in NO release from resting macrophages; in lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages, only and caused an increase in NO production.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14648392>Purification of gastroprotective triterpenoids from the stem bark of Amphipterygium adstringens; role of prostaglandins, sulfhydryls, nitric oxide and capsaicin-sensitive neurons.</a></h1><p>In this investigation three bioactive compounds, responsible for the gastroprotective property of Amphipterygium adstringens, were purified from an active dichloromethane fraction. These compounds were 3alpha-hydroxymasticadienonic acid, beta-sitosterol and 3- epi-oleanolic acid. The latter was the most active compound (88.8 % of gastroprotection) followed by 3alpha-hydroxymasticadienoic acid and beta-sitosterol (69.8 and 42.5 % of gastroprotection, respectively). Carbenoxolone was used as positive control and it showed 88.4 % of gastroprotection.  was also isolated from the active fraction, but it was unable to inhibit the ethanol-induced gastric lesions. The gastroprotection of the methanol extract was completely inhibited by the pretreatment with l-NAME and attenuated by pretreatment with indomethacin and N-ethylmaleimide. These results suggest that endogenous nitric oxide plays an important role in the gastroprotection of A. adstringens methanol extract on ethanol-induced gastric mucosal lesions and that there is partial participation by prostaglandins and endogenous sulfhydryls. The effect of 3alpha-hydroxymasticadienonic acid was attenuated only by pretreatment with N-ethylmaleimide, indicating that endogenous sulfhydryls (thiols) participate in its gastroprotective mechanism. Capsaicin-sensitive afferent neurons do not participate in the gastroprotection of either the methanol extract or 3alpha-hydroxymasticadienoic acid.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29288761>Toxicity and toxicokinetic study of RPh201 in Sprague-Dawley rats.</a></h1><p>Mastic gum is used for health products and in the food industry, and is being tested for several clinical indications. Nevertheless, information on its safety is scarce. Our aim was to test the local and systemic toxicity of RPh201, a botanical extract of gum mastic, and to assess the toxicokinetic profile of the mastic gum constituents  (MDA) and isomasticadienonic acid (IMDA). 340 Sprague-Dawley rats were administered twice weekly subcutaneously with placebo or different doses of RPh201 for 6 months with an interim group at 3 months and a 4-week recovery group. No systemic toxicity was observed with RPh201. Local injection site reactions were observed in all animals, with comparable severity and frequency in the placebo and high dose groups. However, given the relative increase in tissue reaction in the high dose group, these changes were attributed to RPh201 administration. Nevertheless, considering the minor local irritation effects and clear trend for reversibility, the effects were not judged to be adverse. The toxicokinetic study revealed that the MDA and IMDA exposure increased with dose and the increase was supra-proportional on all days. This study supports a "no observed adverse effect level" (NOAEL) of 300 mg/kg body weight in Sprague-Dawley rats.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Mastic gum is rich in triterpenes, which have been postulated to exert antidiabetic effects and improve lipid . In fact, there is evidence of oleanonic acid, a constituent of mastic gum, acting as a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonist, and mastic gum being antidiabetic in mice in vivo. Despite these findings, the exact antidiabetic mechanism of mastic gum remains unknown. Glucocorticoids play a key role in regulating glucose and fatty acid , and inhibition of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 that converts inactive cortisone to active cortisol has been proposed as a promising approach to combat  disturbances including diabetes. In this study, a pharmacophore-based virtual screening was applied to filter a natural product database for possible 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 inhibitors. The hit list analysis was especially focused on the triterpenoids present in Pistacia species. Multiple triterpenoids, such as  and isomasticadienonic acid, main constituents of mastic gum, were identified. Indeed,  and isomasticadienonic acid selectively inhibited 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 over 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 at low micromolar concentrations. These findings suggest that inhibition of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 contributes to the antidiabetic activity of mastic gum.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22458644>3α-Hydroxymasticadienonic acid as an antiproliferative agent that impairs mitochondrial functions.</a></h1><p>Previous investigations on the biological effects of 3α-hydroxymasticadienonic acid (1) have demonstrated both anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activities. However, neither the molecular mechanism of cytotoxic action nor the possible intracellular target(s) have been reported so far for this compound. The crucial role played by mitochondria on both cell survival and death, due to production of ATP and intrinsic apoptosis, respectively, prompted a study of the effect of 1 on isolated rat liver mitochondria. It was found that 1 causes a dose-dependent impairment of mitochondrial bioenergetic parameters, such as the respiratory control index and transmembrane electrical potential. Moreover, in the presence of Ca(2+), at a 10 μM concentration, 1 resulted in the induction of membrane permeability transition by oxidative stress, leading to the release of pro-apoptotic factors. At a 100 μM concentration, compound 1 affected mitochondrial Ca(2+) transport by inhibiting the accumulation of the cation in the mitochondrial matrix. Altogether, it was demonstrated that 1 induces an impairment of mitochondrial functions that may account for the cytotoxicity exhibited by this compound.© 2012 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16512221>Quantitative determination of triterpenes from Amphiptherygium adstringens by liquid chromatography and thin-layer chromatography and morphological analysis of cuachalalate preparations.</a></h1><p>Amphiptherygium adstringens (Anacardiaceae/Julianaceae), local name "cuachalalate," is used in folk medicine for the treatment of cholelithiasis, fevers, fresh wounds, hypercholesterolemia, gastritis, gastric ulcers, and cancer of the gastrointestinal tract. The development of column high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detector (LC-PDA) and high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC)-densitometry methods for the determination of  and 3-hydroxymasticadienonic acid in cuachalalate preparations is described in this paper. Good separation of the compounds could be achieved by both methods. Either might be preparable depending on the requirements. The LC separation was performed on a Phenomenex Synergi MAX-RP 80A reversed-phase column operated at 40 degrees C with detection at 215 nm. The plant materials were extracted with methanol by sonication. The triterpenes present in the plant material and commercial extracts were separated with an acetonitrile-water reagent alcohol isocratic system. The limit of detection was 0.1-0.2 microg/mL. The relative standard deviation values for the determination of triterpenes in plant extracts were less than 1.00%. This is the first report of an analytical method developed for the quantitative analysis of triterpenes from Amphiptherygium adstringens by LC-PDA and HPTLC. The stem bark showed higher amounts of triterpenes, and low amounts in root and stem root. The microscopic description of the crude drug of cuachalalate was also provided.</p></html>
