<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30557836>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibition protects the  of insulin-resistant female rats against triglyceride accumulation by suppressing uric acid.</a></h2><p>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibition has been shown to exert beneficial effects against insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes. Combined oral contraceptive (COC) treatment is associated with impaired glucose and lipid metabolism but the mechanisms are elusive. We therefore, hypothesized that DPP-4 inhibition ameliorates COC-induced glucose dysregulation and hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation through adenosine deaminase (ADA) /xanthine oxidase (XO) /uric acid-dependent pathway. Female Wistar rats received (po) vehicle and COC (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol plus 5.0 μg ; po) with or without DPP-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin; 100 mg/kg; po) for 8 weeks (n = 6/group). Glucose dysmetabolism was assessed by elevated fasting blood glucose, impaired oral glucose tolerance test and homeostatic model assessment of IR. Treatment with COC led to increased plasma fasting glucose, triglyceride-glucose index, 1-h postload glucose response, insulin, free  acid, IR and impaired glucose tolerance. COC treatment also resulted in increased plasma and hepatic TG, TG/HDL-cholesterol ratio, malondialdehyde, uric acid (plasma; 25.2 ± 0.6 mg/dl; hepatic 128.9 ± 8.0 mg/100 mg tissue), lactate dehydrogenase, DPP-4, ADA and XO (plasma;10.5 ± 1.1 U/L; hepatic 21.2 ± 1.4 U/g protein) activities. Likewise, COC led to reduction in nitric oxide level. However, DPP-4 inhibition significantly ameliorated these alterations induced by COC treatment through suppression of uric acid (plasma; 15.1 ± 1.0 mg/dl, hepatic; 75.6 ± 5.0 mg/100 mg tissue), XO (plasma; 4.1 ± 0.9 U/L, hepatic; 8.7 ± 0.4 U/g protein), ADA and DPP-4 activities suggesting their involvement in glucose dysregulation and hepatic TG accumulation induced by COC treatment. Therefore, DPP-4 inhibition would impact positively on cardiometabolic disorders, at least in part, through XO, ADA and uric acid suppression.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

We hypothesized that disruption of glucoregulation and  triglyceride (TG) accumulation induced by COC use would be abated by valproic acid (VPA) treatment through suppression of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and xanthine oxidase (XO) activities. Female Wistar rats aged 9-10 weeks were treated with a combination of estrogen-progestin COC steroids (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol and 5.0 μg ; p.o.) with or without VPA (100.0 mg/kg; p.o.) daily for 6 weeks. The result shows that the disrupted glucoregulation and associated elevated hepatic ADA activity, plasma and hepatic XO activity, uric acid (UA), TG/HDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, and malondialdehyde induced by COC treatment were attenuated by VPA treatment. However, VPA did not have any effect on plasma aldosterone, corticosterone, ADA, circulating and hepatic free  acid. Our results demonstrate that suppression of plasma and hepatic XO activities, along with hepatic ADA activity and UA by VPA treatment, protects against disrupted glucoregulation and increased  TG by COC independent of elevated corticosteroids. The findings imply that VPA would provide protection against the development of cardiometabolic disorder via inhibition of the ADA/XO/UA-mediated pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30903201>Involvement of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors in lipid accumulation and depressed G6PD activity in the livers of rats treated with postpartum oral estrogen-progestin.</a></h2><p>Postpartum contraception is an important step for preventing closely spaced pregnancy. Combined oral contraceptive (COC) has been linked to cardiometabolic disturbances. We therefore hypothesized that postpartum oral estrogen-progestin use induces hepatic lipid accumulation that is associated with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation via adenosine deaminase (ADA)/xanthine oxidase (XO)/uric acid (UA)-dependent pathway. Female Wistar rats weighing 130-150 g were mated to achieve timed pregnancy and delivery. Twenty-four (24) dams were randomly assigned to receive vehicle (po), COC (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol and 5.0 μg ; po), COC with GR blockade (mifepristone; 80.0 mg/kg; po) and COC with MR blockade (spironolactone; 0.25 mg/kg; po) daily between 3rd and 11th week postpartum. Data showed that postpartum COC resulted in glucose dysregulation, increased visceral adiposity,  weight, plasma corticosterone, aldosterone, circulating and hepatic free  acid (FFA), triglyceride (TG), adenosine deaminase (ADA), uric acid production, lactate production, and oxidative marker injury. On the other hand, G6PD-dependent antioxidant defenses were depressed by postpartum COC. However, these effects were attenuated by GR or MR blockade. Our data demonstrate that enhanced G6PD-dependent antioxidant defenses and suppressed ADA/XO/UA pathway in the  by GR or MR blockade improves glucose dysregulation and hepatic TG accumulation induced by postpartum COC. This study implies a plausible involvement of GR and MR via defective G6PD-dependent antioxidant barrier and increased activity of ADA/XO/UA pathway in postpartum COC-induced hepatic lipid accumulation.</p></html>
