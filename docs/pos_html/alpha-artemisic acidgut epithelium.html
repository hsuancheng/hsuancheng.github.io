To define the probiotic properties of seven Lactic  Bacteria (LAB) strains, we tested them for survival in simulated gastro-intestinal conditions, antimicrobial activities, co-aggregative abilities, and interferences studies against five human intestinal pathogens ( ATCC 13076,  ATCC 7644,  O157: H7 ATCC 35150,  ATCC 29544 and  ATCC 33291).The LAB strains were able to survive the stomach simulated conditions, and varied in their abilities to survive the small intestinal-simulated conditions. The strains showed antibiotic susceptibility profiles with values equal or below the breakpoints set by the European Food and Safety Authority. The LAB cell-free cultures supernatants showed antimicrobial activities, with inhibition zones ranging from 10.0 to 17.2 mm. All the LAB strains showed moderate auto-aggregation abilities while the greatest co-aggregation abilities were observed for  W23,  W21 and  W71. The individual LAB strains showed strain-specific abilities to reduce the invasion of intestinal pathogens in an interference model with Caco-2 cells. Increased invasion inhibition was found when different combinations of LAB strains were used in the interference tests.The LAB strains examined in this study may protect the intestinal  through a series of barriers (antimicrobial activity, co-aggregation with pathogens, adherence) and interference mechanisms. Consequently, these LAB strains may be considered candidates for prophylactic use to prevent intestinal infections.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27989833>Identification and characterization of protein 14-3-3 in carcinogenic liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini.</a></h1><p>Protein 14-3-3s are abundant phospho-serine/threonine binding proteins, which are highly conserved among eukaryotes. Members of this protein family mediate metabolism and signal transduction networks through binding to hundreds of other protein partners. Protein 14-3-3s have been studied in other species of parasitic helminthes, but little is known about this protein in the carcinogenic liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini. In this study, we identified and characterized protein 14-3-3s of O. viverrini. Seven protein 14-3-3 encoded sequences were retrieved from the O. viverrini genome database. Multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis were performed. Two isoforms (protein 14-3-3 zeta and protein 14-3-3 epsilon) that have been previously found in the excretory-secretory (ES) products of O. viverrini were produced as recombinant protein in E. coli and the proteins were then used to immunize mice to obtain specific antibodies. Western blot analysis showed that both proteins were detected in all obtainable developmental stages of O. viverrini and the ES products. Immunolocalization revealed that both isoforms were expressed throughout tissues and organs except the  . The highest expression was observed in testes especially in developing spermatocytes, suggesting their role in spermatogenesis. Prominent expression was also detected on tegumental surface of the parasite and on epical surface of bile duct  indicates their additional role in host-parasite interaction. These findings indicate that protein 14-3-3s play important role in the life cycle of the parasite and might be involved in the pathogenesis of O. viverrini infection.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, little is known about their potential effects on intestinal homeostasis. In this study we examined the effect of some of these food additives on  inflammation.Mice were given drinking water containing maltodextrin (MDX), propylene glycol, or animal gelatin, and then challenged with dextran sulfate sodium or indomethacin. In parallel, mice fed a MDX-enriched diet were given the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA). Transcriptomic analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction, mucin-2 expression, phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase quantification, and H&E staining was performed on colonic tissues. Mucosa-associated microbiota composition was characterized by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. For the in vitro experiments, murine intestinal crypts and the human mucus-secreting HT29-methotrexate treated cell line were stimulated with MDX in the presence or absence of TUDCA or a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor.Diets enriched in MDX, but not propylene glycol or animal gelatin, exacerbated intestinal inflammation in both models. Analysis of the mechanisms underlying the detrimental effect of MDX showed up-regulation of inositol requiring protein 1β, a sensor of ER stress, in goblet cells, and a reduction of mucin-2 expression with no significant change in mucosa-associated microbiota. Stimulation of murine intestinal crypts and HT29-methotrexate treated cell line cells with MDX induced inositol requiring protein 1β via a p38 MAP kinase-dependent mechanism. Treatment of mice with TUDCA prevented mucin-2 depletion and attenuated colitis in MDX-fed mice.MDX increases ER stress in  epithelial cells with the downstream effect of reducing mucus production and enhancing colitis susceptibility.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

As the ingested food moves along the GI tract, gastric , digestive enzymes, and  resident microbes aid digestion as well as nutrient and mineral absorption. Due to the harsh luminal environment, replenishment of new epithelial cells is essential to maintain organ structure and function during routine turnover and injury repair. Tissue-specific adult stem cells in the GI tract serve as a continuous source for this immense regenerative activity. Tissue homeostasis is achieved by a delicate balance between gain and loss of cells. In homeostasis, temporal tissue damage is rapidly restored by well-balanced tissue regeneration, whereas prolonged imbalance may result in diverse pathologies of homeostasis and injury repair. Starting with a summary of the current knowledge of GI tract homeostasis, we continue with providing models of acute injury and chronic diseases. Finally, we will discuss how primary organoid cultures allow new insights into the mechanisms of homeostasis, injury repair, and disease, and how this novel 3D culture system has the potential to translate into the clinic.Copyright © 2017 Int.

Previous studies have shown that Lactobacillus has a protective effect on intestinal morphology, intestinal  integrity and appropriate maturation of -associated tissues. Here, gene expression in jejunum tissue of weaned piglets was investigated by RNA-seq analysis after administration of sterile saline, Lactobacillus reuteri, or an antibiotic (chlortetracycline). In total, 401 and 293 genes were significantly regulated by chlortetracycline and L. reuteri, respectively, compared with control treatment. Notably, the HP, NOX1 and GPX2 genes were significantly up-regulated in the L. reuteri group compared with control, which is related to the antioxidant ability of this strain. In addition, the expression of genes related to arachidonic  metabolism and linoleic  metabolism enriched after treatment with L. reuteri. The fatty  composition in the jejunum and colon was examined by GC-MS analysis and suggested that the MUFA C18:1n9c, and PUFAs C18:2n6c and C20:4n6 were increased in the L. reuteri group, verifying the GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses of the RNA-seq results. The results contribute to our understanding of the probiotic activity of this strain and its application in pig production.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30364185>Interactions of Surface Exopolysaccharides From  and  Within the Intestinal Environment.</a></h1><p>Exopolysaccharides (EPS) are surface carbohydrate polymers present in most bacteria acting as a protective surface layer but also interacting with the surrounding environment. This review discusses the roles of EPS synthesized by strains of  and , many of them with probiotic characteristics, in the intestinal environment. Current knowledge on genetics and biosynthesis pathways of EPS in lactic  bacteria and bifidobacteria, as well as the development of genetic tools, has created possibilities to elucidate the interplay between EPS and host intestinal mucosa. These include the microbiota that inhabits this ecological niche and the host cells. Several carbohydrate recognition receptors located in the intestinal  could be involved in the interaction with bacterial EPS and modulation of immune response; however, little is known about the receptors recognizing EPS from lactobacilli or bifidobacteria and the triggered response. On the contrary, it has been clearly demonstrated that EPS play a relevant role in the persistence of the producing bacteria in the intestinal tract. Indeed, some authors postulate that some of the beneficial actions of EPS-producing probiotics could be related to the formation of a biofilm layer protecting the host against injury, for example by pathogens or their toxins. Nevertheless, the  formation of biofilms by probiotics has not been proved to date. Finally, EPS produced by probiotic strains are also able to interact with the intestinal microbiota that populates the . In fact, some of these polymers can be used as carbohydrate fermentable source by some  commensals thus being putatively involved in the release of bacterial metabolites that exert positive benefits for the host. In spite of the increasing knowledge about the role that these surface molecules play in the interaction of probiotic bacteria with the  mucosal actors, both intestinal receptors and microbiota, the challenging issue is to demonstrate the functionality of EPS , which will open an avenue of opportunities for the application of EPS-producing probiotics to improve health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26592350>EWGWS insert in Plasmodium falciparum ookinete surface enolase is involved in binding of PWWP containing peptides: Implications to mosquito midgut invasion by the parasite.</a></h1><p>There are multiple stages in the life cycle of Plasmodium that invade host cells. Molecular machinery involved is such host-pathogen interactions constitute excellent drug targets and/or vaccine candidates. A screen using a phage display library has previously demonstrated presence of enolase on the surface of the Plasmodium ookinete. Phage-displayed peptides that bound to the ookinete contained a conserved motif (PWWP) in their sequence. Here, direct binding of these peptides with recombinant Plasmodium falciparum enolase (rPfeno) was investigated. These peptides showed specific binding to rPfeno, but failed to bind to other enolases. Plasmodium spp enolases are distinct in having an insert of five amino  ((104)EWGWS(108)) that is not found in host enolases. The possibility of this insert being the recognition motif for the PWWP containing peptides was examined, (i) by comparing the binding of the peptides with rPfeno and a deletion variant Δ-rPfeno lacking (104)EWGWS(108), (ii) by measuring the changes in proton chemical shifts of PWWP peptides on binding to different enolases and (iii) by inter-molecular docking experiment to locate the peptide binding site. Results from these studies showed that the pentapeptide insert of Pfeno indeed constitutes the binding site for the PWWP domain containing peptide ligands. Search for sequences homologous to phage displayed peptides among peritrophic matrix proteins resulted in identification of perlecan, laminin, peritrophin and spacran. The possibility of these PWWP domain-containing proteins in the peritrophic matrix of insect  to interact with ookinete cell surface enolase and facilitate the invasion of mosquito midgut  is discussed.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we investigated the thermo-acidophilic archaeal virus SMV1 as a candidate therapeutic nano-vector for the distal mammalian GI tract microbiome. We investigated the anatomical distribution, vector stability and immunogenicity of this virus following oral ingestion in mice and compared these traits to the more classically used Inovirus vector M13KE. We found that SMV1 particles were highly stable under both simulated GI tract conditions (in vitro) and in mice (in vivo). Moreover, SMV1 could not be detected in tissues outside the GI tract and it elicited a nearly undetectable inflammatory response. Finally, we used human intestinal organoids (HIOs) to show that labelled SMV1 did not invade or otherwise perturb the human GI tract .Sulfolobus monocaudavirus 1 appeared stable and safe during passage though the mammalian GI tract.This is the first study evaluating an archaeal virus as a potential therapeutic nanoparticle delivery system and it opens new possibilities for future development of novel nanoplatforms.© 2017 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27105910>Organoids as an ex vivo model for studying the serotonin system in the murine small intestine and colon .</a></h1><p>Intestinal organoids were recently established as an ex vivo model of the intestinal . The present study investigated the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) system using organoids. Organoids from murine small intestinal and colonic crypts were successfully cultured. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that small intestinal and colonic organoids express mRNAs encoding tryptophan hydroxylase-1 (TPH1) (the rate-limiting enzyme of 5-HT synthesis), serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT), 5-HT receptor (HTR)2A, HTR2B, and HTR4. SERT mRNA levels were significantly higher in the small intestine than in the colon in both the mucosal tissues and organoids, as estimated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Although the 5-HT concentration and levels of chromogranin A (CgA) (an enteroendocrine cell marker), TPH1, and HTR4 mRNAs were significantly higher in the colonic mucosa than the small intestinal mucosa, they were the same in small intestinal and colonic organoids. There were no significant differences in HTR2A and HTR2B mRNA levels between the small intestine and colon in either the mucosal tissues or organoids. Immunofluorescence staining showed that the number of CgA-positive cells in the colonic organoids appeared to increase upon culturing with acetate. Acetate supplementation significantly increased CgA, TPH1, and HTR4 mRNA levels in the colonic organoids. We propose that organoids are useful for investigating the 5-HT system in the intestinal , even though colonic organoids may require  microbiota-derived factors such as short-chain fatty .Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

To do this, the small intestine is made up of a complex network of blood vessels, nerves, and muscles that work together to achieve this task. It is a massive organ that has an average length of 3 to 5 meters. It is divided into the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.[1][2][3]: The duodenum is the shortest section, on average measuring from 20 cm to 25 cm in length. Its proximal end is connected to the antrum of the stomach, separated by the pylorus. The distal end is at the ligament of Treitz, in which the jejunum begins. The duodenum surrounds the pancreases, in the shape of a "C." It receives chyme from the stomach, pancreatic enzymes, and bile from the liver. The jejunum is roughly 2.5 meters in length, contains plicae circulares (muscular flaps) and villi to absorb the products of digestion. The ileum comes next, measuring around 3 m, and ends at the cecum. It absorbs any nutrients that got past the jejunum, with major absorptive products being vitamin B12 and bile . : Serosa: The serosa is the outside layer of the small intestine and consists mesothelium and , which encircles the jejunum and ileum, and the anterior surface of the duodenum since the posterior side is retroperitoneal. The epithelial cells in the small intestine have a rapid renewal rate, with cells lasting for only 3 to 5 days. Muscularis: The muscularis consists of two smooth muscle layers, a thin outer longitudinal layer that shortens and elongates the , and a thicker inner circular layer of smooth muscle which causes constriction. Nerves lie between these two layers and allow these to muscle layers to work together to propagate food in a proximal to distal direction. Submucosa: The submucosa consists of a layer of connective tissue that contains the blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatics.   Mucosa: The mucosa is the innermost layer and is designed for maximal absorption by being covered with villi protruding into the lumen that increases the surface area. The crypt layer of the small bowel that is the area of continual cell renewal and proliferation. Cells move from the crypts to the villi and change into either enterocytes; goblet cells; Paneth cells; or enteroendocrine cells. Of importance is the mesentery, which is a double fold of the peritoneum that not only anchors the small intestines to the back of the abdominal wall, but also contains the blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatic vessels that supply the small intestine.[4][5]Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25612669>The multifactorial interplay of diet, the microbiome and appetite control: current knowledge and future challenges.</a></h1><p>The recent availability of high-throughput nucleic  sequencing technologies has rapidly advanced approaches to analysing the role of the  microbiome in governance of human health, including  health, and also metabolic, cardiovascular and mental health, inter alia. Recent scientific studies suggest that energy intake (EI) perturbations at the population level cannot account for the current obesity epidemic, and significant work is investigating the potential role of the microbiome, and in particular its metabolic products, notably SCFA, predominantly acetate, propionate and butyrate, the last of which is an energy source for the  of the large intestine. The energy yield from dietary residues may be a significant factor influencing energy balance. This review posits that the contribution towards EI is governed by EI diet composition (not just fibre), the composition of the microbiome and by the levels of physical activity. Furthermore, we hypothesise that these factors do not exist in a steady state, but rather are dynamic, with both short- and medium-term effects on appetite regulation. We suggest that the existing modelling strategies for bacterial dynamics, specifically for growth in chemostat culture, are of utility in understanding the dynamic interplay of diet, activity and microbiomic organisation. Such approaches may be informative in optimising the application of dietary and microbial therapy to promote health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30999787>Probing paracellular - transcellular tissue barrier permeability using a  mucosal explant culture system.</a></h1><p>Intestinal permeation enhancers (PEs), i.e. agents improving oral delivery of therapeutic drugs with poor bioavailability, may typically act by two principally different mechanisms: to increase either transcellular -or paracellular passage across the . With the aim to define these different modes of action in a small intestinal mucosal explant system, the transcellular-acting PE sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was compared to the paracellular-acting PE ethylenediaminetetraacetic  (EDTA), using several fluorescent polar - and lipophilic probes. Here, SDS rendered the enterocyte cell membranes leaky for the relatively small polar tracers Lucifer yellow and a 3 kD Texas red-conjugated dextran, but most conspicuously SDS blocked constitutive endocytosis from the brush border. In contrast, the main action of EDTA was to increase paracellular passage across the  of both polar probes, including 10 - and 70 kDa dextrans and lipophilic probes, visualized by distinct stripy lateral staining of enterocytes and/or accumulation in the lamina propria. In addition, EDTA caused a loss of epithelial cell polarity by opening tight junctions for diffusion of domain-specific basolateral/apical cell membrane protein markers into the opposite domains. By transmission electron microscopy, SDS caused the formation of vacuoles and vesicle-like structures at the lateral cell membranes. In contrast, EDTA led to a bulging of the whole enterocyte apex, resulting in a "cobblestone" appearance of the , probably caused by an extreme contraction of the perijunctional actomyosin ring. We conclude that the mucosal explant system is a convenient model for predicting transcellular/paracellular modes of action of novel prospective PEs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26376476>Gastroduodenal mucosal defense mechanisms.</a></h1><p>To highlight recent developments in the field of gastroduodenal mucosal defense with emphasis on lumen- interactions.There has been a growing interest in the physiological functions of luminal chemosensors present from tongue to colon that detect organic molecules in the luminal content associated with nutrient ingestion, usually associated with specialized cells, in particular the enteroendocrine cells. These receptors transduce the release of peptide hormones, in particular proglucagon-derived products such as the glucagon-like peptides (GLPs), which have profound effects on  function and on metabolism. Luminal chemosensors transduce GLP release in response to changes in the cellular environment, as part of the mechanism of nutrient chemosensing. GLP-2 has important trophic effects on the intestinal mucosa, including increasing the proliferation rate of stem cells and reducing transmucosal permeability to ions and small molecules, in addition to increasing the rate of duodenal bicarbonate secretion. GLP-1, although traditionally considered an incretin that enhances the effect of insulin on peripheral tissues, also has trophic effects on the intestinal .A better understanding of the mechanisms that mediate GLP release can further illuminate the importance of nutrient chemosensing as an important component of the mechanism that mediates the trophic effects of luminal nutrients. GLP-1 and GLP-2 are already in clinical use for the treatment of diabetes and intestinal failure. Improved understanding of the control of their release and their end-organ effects will identify new clinical indications and interventions that enhance their release.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27027557>Intraluminal tranexamic  inhibits intestinal sheddases and mitigates  and lung injury and inflammation in a rodent model of hemorrhagic shock.</a></h1><p>Intravenous tranexamic  (TXA) is an effective adjunct after hemorrhagic shock (HS) because of its antifibrinolytic properties. TXA is also a serine protease inhibitor, and recent laboratory data demonstrated that intraluminal TXA into the small bowel inhibited digestive proteases and protected the . A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM-17) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) are effective sheddases of intestinal syndecan-1, which when shed, exposes the underlying intestinal  to digestive proteases and subsequent systemic insult. We therefore hypothesized that intraluminal TXA as a serine protease inhibitor would reduce intestinal sheddases and syndecan-1 shedding, mitigating  and distant organ (lung) damage.Mice underwent 90 minutes of HS to a mean arterial pressure of 35 ± 5 mm Hg followed by the intraluminal administration of TXA or vehicle. After 3 hours, the small intestine, lung, and blood were collected for analysis.Intraluminal TXA significantly reduced  and lung histopathologic injury and inflammation compared with HS alone. , lung, and systemic ADAM-17 and TNF-α were significantly increased by HS but lessened by TXA.

TXA reduced ADAM-17 and TNF-α, but not syndecan-1, in TXA-sham animals compared with sham vehicles.Results of the present study demonstrate a beneficial effect of intraluminal TXA in the  and lung after experimental HS in part because of the inhibition of the syndecan-1 shedding by ADAM-17 and TNF-α. Further studies are needed to determine if orally administered TXA could provide similar intestinal protection and thus be of potential benefit to patients with survivable hemorrhage at risk for organ injury.

LGG-induced radioprotection is toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-dependent and is associated with the migration of COX-2+mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from the lamina propria of the villus to the lamina propria near the crypt epithelial stem cells. Our goals were to define the mechanism of LGG radioprotection including identification of the TLR2 agonist, and the mechanism of the MSC migration and to determine the safety and efficacy of this approach in models relevant to clinical radiation therapy.Intestinal radioprotection was modelled in vitro with cell lines and enteroids as well as in vivo by assaying clinical outcomes and crypt survival. Fractionated abdominal and single dose radiation were used along with syngeneic CT26 colon tumour grafts to assess tumour radioprotection.LGG with a mutation in the processing of lipoteichoic  (LTA), a TLR2 agonist, was not radioprotective, while LTA agonist and native LGG were. An agonist of CXCR4 blocked LGG-induced MSC migration and LGG-induced radioprotection. LGG given by gavage induced expression of CXCL12, a CXCR4 agonist, in pericryptal macrophages and depletion of macrophages by clodronate liposomes blocked LGG-induced MSC migration and radioprotection. LTA effectively protected the normal intestinal crypt, but not tumours in fractionated radiation regimens.LGG acts as a 'time-release capsule' releasing radioprotective LTA. LTA then primes the epithelial stem cell niche to protect epithelial stem cells by triggering a multicellular, adaptive immune signalling cascade involving macrophages and PGE2 secreting MSCs.; Pre-results.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2019.

The objective of the present study was to describe the histochemistry, immunohistochemistry and cytochemistry of the anterior midgut region of the stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata in comparison with the honey bee Apis mellifera. The anterior midgut region of both species was evaluated for identification of the enzymes β- galactosidase, glucose-6-phosphatase,  phosphatase, and alkaline phosphatase, the membrane transporter aquaporin, the hormone FMRF-amide, and lysosomes. Histology of the anterior midgut region showed that this region in M. quadrifasciata workers did not present external folds of the wall, whereas the following midgut wall presented many. In A. mellifera, folds in the midgut wall occur starting from the fore- midgut transition region. Despite these morphological differences, the tests evaluated were similar in both species. β-galactosidase was not found in the anterior midgut cells. Glucose-6-phosphatase and  phosphatase occurred in the apical region of the  . Alkaline phosphatase occurred in vesicles in apical cytoplasm and in the basal plasma membrane infoldings of the epithelial cells. Aquaporin was found in the basal region of the midgut  and in the associated visceral muscles. FMRF-amide was found only in nerve endings in the anterior midgut region. All cells in the anterior midgut region were rich in lysosomes.

They play an essential role in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis by limiting microbial  interactions and preventing unnecessary microbe-driven inflammation. Pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) belongs to Regenerating islet-derived III proteins family and is a C-type (Ca dependent) lectin. PAP protein plays a protective effect presenting anti-inflammatory properties able to reduce the severity of colitis, preserving  barrier and epithelial inflammation. Here, we sought to determine whether PAP delivered at intestinal lumen by recombinant Lactococcus lactis strain (LL-PAP) before and after chemically induced colitis is able to reduce the severity in two models of colitis. After construction and characterization of our recombinant strains, we tested their effects in dinitro-benzenesulfonic- (DNBS) and Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis model. After the DNBS challenge, mice treated with LL-PAP presented less severe colitis compared with PBS and LL-empty-treated mice groups. After the DSS challenge, no protective effects of LL-PAP could be detected. We determined that after 5 days administration, LL-PAP increase butyrate producer's bacteria, especially Eubacterium plexicaudatum. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that a treatment with LL-PAP shifts the microbiota preventing the severity of colon inflammation in DNBS colitis model. These protective roles of LL-PAP in DNBS colitis model might be through intestinal microbiota modulation.© 2019 The Authors.

Increased intestinal permeability is known to contribute to PBT in cirrhosis, although the role of the mucus layer has not been addressed in detail. A clear route of translocation for luminal intestinal bacteria is yet to be defined, but we hypothesize that the recently described -vascular barrier (GVB) is impaired in experimental portal hypertension, leading to increased accessibility of the vascular compartment for translocating bacteria.Cirrhosis was induced in mouse models using bile-duct ligation (BDL) and CCl. Pre-hepatic portal-hypertension was induced by partial portal vein ligation (PPVL). Intestinal permeability was compared in these mice after GFP-Escherichia coli or different sized FITC-dextrans were injected into the intestine.Healthy and pre-hepatic portal-hypertensive (PPVL) mice lack translocation of FITC-dextran and GFP-E. coli from the small intestine to the liver, whereas BDL and CCl-induced cirrhotic mice demonstrate pathological translocation, which is not altered by prior thoracic-duct ligation. The mucus layer is reduced in thickness, with loss of goblet cells and Muc2-staining and expression in cirrhotic but not PPVL mice. These changes are associated with bacterial overgrowth in the inner mucus layer and pathological translocation of GFP-E. coli through the ileal . GVB is profoundly altered in BDL and CCl-mice with Ileal extravasation of large-sized 150 kDa-FITC-dextran, but only slightly altered in PPVL mice. This pathological endothelial permeability and accessibility in cirrhotic mice is associated with augmented expression of PV1 in intestinal vessels. OCA but not fexaramine stabilizes the GVB, whereas both FXR-agonists ameliorate  to liver translocation of GFP-E. coli.Cirrhosis, but not portal hypertension per se, grossly impairs the endothelial and muco-epithelial barriers, promoting PBT to the portal-venous circulation. Both barriers appear to be FXR-modulated, with FXR-agonists reducing PBT via the portal-venous route.For intestinal bacteria to enter the systemic circulation, they must cross the mucus and epithelial layer, as well as the -vascular barrier. Cirrhosis disrupts all 3 of these barriers, giving bacteria access to the portal-venous circulation and thus, the -liver axis. Diminished luminal bile  availability, cirrhosis and the associated reduction in farnesoid x receptor (FXR) signaling seem, at least partly, to mediate these changes, as FXR-agonists reduce bacterial translocation via the portal-venous route to the liver in cirrhosis.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

In consequence, the reduced gill contact area with water requires appropriate compensation to maintain ion and -base homeostasis, often with important ramifications for other organs. Associated modifications in the structure and function of the gills themselves, the skin, the , the kidney, and the physiology of water exchange and ion-linked -base regulation are discussed. In air-breathing fish, the  may gain particular importance for the uptake of ions. In addition, tissues frequently exposed to environmental air encounter much higher oxygen partial pressures than typically observed in fish tissues. Physostomous fish using the swimbladder for aerial respiration, for example, will encounter aerial oxygen partial pressure at the swimbladder  when frequently gulping air in hypoxic water. Hyperoxic conditions or rapid changes in oxygen partial pressures result in an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Accordingly, in air-breathing fish, strategies of ionoregulation may be greatly modified, and the ROS defense capacity of air-exposed tissues is improved.Crown Copyright © 2018.

This work illustrates that  is capable of enhancing the intestinal mucus layer and goblet cell function via upregulation of gene expression and autophagy signaling pathways, with a net increase in mucin production. Microbe-host interactions in the intestine occur along the mucus-covered epithelium. In the gastrointestinal tract, mucus is composed of glycan-covered proteins, or mucins, which are secreted by goblet cells to form a protective gel-like structure above the epithelium. Low levels of mucin or alterations in mucin glycans are associated with inflammation and colitis in mice and humans. Although current literature links microbes to the modulation of goblet cells and mucins, the molecular pathways involved are not yet fully understood. Using a combination of gnotobiotic mice and mucus-secreting cell lines, we have identified a human-derived microbe, , which adheres to intestinal mucus and secretes metabolites that upregulate the major mucin MUC2 and modulate goblet cell function. Unlike other  species,  does not extensively degrade mucin glycans and cannot grow on mucin alone.

Our recent data suggest Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (Lp299v) supplementation reduces infarct size in male rats. Limited human data are available on the impact of Lp299v on the vasculature.To determine whether oral Lp299v supplementation improves vascular endothelial function and reduces systemic inflammation in humans with stable coronary artery disease (CAD).Twenty men with stable CAD consumed a drink containing Lp299v (20 billion CFU) once daily for 6 weeks. After a 4-week washout, subjects were given an option of additionally participating in a 10-day study of oral liquid vancomycin (250 mg QID). Vascular endothelial function was measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation. Before and after Lp299v, plasma short-chain fatty , trimethylamine oxide, and adipokine levels were measured. Additional plasma samples underwent unbiased metabolomic analyses using liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy. 16S rRNA sequencing was used to determine changes of the stool microbiome. Arterioles from patients with CAD were obtained, and endothelium-dependent vasodilation was measured by video microscopy after intraluminal incubation with plasma from Lp299v study subjects. Lp299v supplementation improved brachial flow-mediated dilation ( P=0.008) without significant changes in plasma cholesterol profiles, fasting glucose, or body mass index. Vancomycin did not impact flow-mediated dilation. Lp299v supplementation decreased circulating levels of IL (interleukin)-8 ( P=0.01), IL-12 ( P=0.02), and leptin ( P=0.0007) but did not significantly change plasma trimethylamine oxide concentrations ( P=0.27). Plasma propionate ( P=0.004) increased, whereas acetate levels decreased ( P=0.03). Post-Lp299v plasma improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation in resistance arteries from patients with CAD ( P=0.02).16S rRNA analysis showed the Lactobacillus genus was enriched in postprobiotic stool samples without other changes.Lp299v improved vascular endothelial function and decreased systemic inflammation in men with CAD, independent of changes in traditional risk factors and trimethylamine oxide. Circulating -derived metabolites likely account for these improvements and merit further study.URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

Adhesion to  has been considered one of the key criteria for the characterization of probiotics because it extends their residence time in the intestine and as a consequence, can influence the health of the host by modifying the local microbiota or modulating the immune response. Nevertheless, there are very few reports on the adhesion properties to  and mucus of microorganisms after passing through the gastrointestinal tract. In the present work, we evaluate the adhesion ability in vitro of L. paracasei strains isolated from kefir grains after  and bile stress and we observed that they survive simulated gastrointestinal passage in different levels depending on the strain. L. paracasei CIDCA 8339, 83120 and 83123 were more resistant than L. paracasei CIDCA 83121 and 83124, with a higher susceptibility to simulated gastric conditions. Proteomic analysis of L. paracasei subjected to  and bile stress revealed that most of the proteins that were positively regulated correspond to the glycolytic pathway enzymes, with an overall effect of stress on the activation of the energy source. Moreover, it is worth to remark that after gastrointestinal passage, L. paracasei strains have increased their ability to adhere to mucin and epithelial cells in vitro being this factor of relevance for maintenance of the strain in the  environment to exert its probiotic action.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Previously, we have reported that some 6-amino-2,4,5-trimethylpyridin-3-ols have significant levels of antiangiogenic activity via PI3K inhibition. Based on the reports that angiogenesis is involved in the aggravation of IBD and that PI3K is a potential target for IBD therapy, we investigated whether the scaffold has inhibitory activity against in vitro and in vivo models of colitis. Many analogues showed >80% inhibition against TNF-α-induced monocyte adhesion to colon epithelial cells at 1μM. Compound 8m showed IC50=0.19μM, which is about five orders of magnitude better than that of 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA, IC50=18.1mM), a positive control. In a rat model of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS)-induced colitis, orally administered 8m dramatically ameliorated TNBS-induced colon inflammation. It was demonstrated by a high level of suppression in myeloperoxidase (MPO), a surrogate marker of colitis, as well as almost perfect recovery of colon and body weights in a dose-dependent manner. Compared to sulfasalazine, a prodrug of 5-ASA, compound 8m showed >300-fold better efficacy in those parameters. Taken together, 6-amino-2,4,5-trimethylpyridin-3-ols can provide a novel platform for anti-IBD drug discovery.Copyright © 2016.

Therefore, phycotoxins can reach cells underlying the , such as enteric glial cells (EGCs), which are involved in  homeostasis, motility, and barrier integrity. This study compared the toxicological effects of pectenotoxin-2 (PTX2), yessotoxin (YTX), okadaic  (OA), azaspiracid-1 (AZA1), 13-desmethyl-spirolide C (SPX), and palytoxin (PlTX) on the rat EGC cell line CRL2690.

SCFA (formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate) are formed by the anaerobic carbohydrates fermentation and branched-chain fatty  (BCFA), such as isobutyric and isovaleric , are derived from amino  valine and leucine. Phenylcarboxylic  (PCA), such as phenylacetic  (PAA), phenyipropionic  (PPA), phenyllactic  (PLA) and some other , are metabolites of amino  phenylalanine and tyrosine involved in host adaptation and regulation. ma unique experiment, the authors first examined effect of the carboxylic  on host cell proliferation in organotypic tissue cultures (rat spleen explants). The study showed that almost all biogenic aliphatic carboxylic  have a positive effect on cell proliferation in rat spleen tissue. This fundamentally distinguishes them from amino , many of which have an inhibitory effect at the same concentrations. These findings suggest that SCFA, including hydrox~ and oxo derivatives, can act as positive regulators of host immune tissues. Some SCFA (for example, butyric ), stimulate proliferation of normal host cells (immune tissue, intestinal ), but inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells ('butyrate paradox'). Unlike SCFA, phenylcarboxylic  have a negative effect on host immune tissues explants and induce apoptosis. These data confirm the potential contribution of phenylcarboxylic  in the pathogenesis of chronic disorders associated with impaired immune response, including autoimmune diseases. The authors suggest that PCA may serve as early metabolic markers of sepsis, immune-related diseases and chronic inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease (iBD), colorectal cancer, chronic kidney disease and liver, secondary imrnunodeficiency. It can be assumed that carboxylic  are evolutionary precursors of amino  that have a wide variety of functions and able to modulate not only proliferation but also apoptosis. The results agree well with the data obtained in the study of Actoflor-C (microbial metabolites complex) and can be used to study mechanisms of action of probiotic strains and metabiotics (e.g. butyrate and propionate-containing formulations), as well as for the development of innovative medicines.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28977605>Hydrogen Sulfide and Sulfate Prebiotic Stimulates the Secretion of GLP-1 and Improves Glycemia in Male Mice.</a></h1><p>Recently, the gastrointestinal microbiome, and its metabolites, has emerged as a potential regulator of host metabolism. However, to date little is known on the precise mechanisms of how this regulation occurs. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is abundantly produced in the colon by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). H2S is a bioactive gas that plays regulatory roles in many systems, including metabolic hormone regulation. This gas metabolite is produced in close proximity to the glucagonlike peptide-1 (GLP-1)-secreting cells in the  . GLP-1 is a peptide hormone that plays pivotal roles in both glucose homeostasis and appetite regulation. We hypothesized that H2S can directly regulate GLP-1 secretion. We demonstrated that H2S donors (NaHS and GYY4137) directly stimulate GLP-1 secretion in murine L-cells (GLUTag) and that this occurs through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase without affecting cell viability. We then increased SRB in mice by supplementing the diet with a prebiotic chondroitin sulfate for 4 weeks. Mice treated with chondroitin sulfate had elevated Desulfovibrio piger levels in the feces and increased colonic and fecal H2S concentration. These animals also had enhanced GLP-1 and insulin secretion, improved oral glucose tolerance, and reduced food consumption. These results indicate that H2S plays a stimulatory role in GLP-1 secretion and that sulfate prebiotics can enhance GLP-1 release and its downstream metabolic actions.Copyright © 2017 Endocrine Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27781093> chemosensing: implications for disease pathogenesis.</a></h1><p>The ability of humans to sense chemical signals in ingested substances is implicit in the ability to detect the five basic tastes; sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami. Of these, sweet, bitter, and umami tastes are detected by lingual G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Recently, these receptors were also localized to the  mucosa. In this review, we will emphasize recent advances in the understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of foregut luminal chemosensing, with special emphasis on cell surface GPCRs such as the sweet and proteinaceous taste receptors (TASRs), short- and long-chain fatty  (FA) receptors, and bile  receptors. The majority of these luminal chemosensors are expressed on enteroendocrine cells (EECs), which are specialized endocrine cells in the intestine and pancreas that release  hormones with ligand activation. These  hormones are responsible for a wide variety of physiologic and homeostatic mechanisms, including glycemic control, appetite stimulation and suppression, regulation of gastric emptying, and trophic effects on the intestinal . Released from the EECs, the  peptides have paracrine, autocrine, and endocrine effects. Additionally, EECs have unique direct connections to the enteric nervous system enabling precise transmission of sensory data to and communication with the central nervous system.

Scientific evidence accumulated over the last four decades has implied that the disease pathologies in CLD and BT are connected as a loop in the -liver axis and exacerbate each other. Pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor and nuclear receptor that is expressed ubiquitously along the -liver-axis. PXR has been intricately associated with the regulation of various mechanisms attributed in causing BT. The importance of PXR as the mechanistic linker molecule in the -liver axis and its role in regulating bacterial interactions with the host in CLD has not been explored. PubMed was used to perform an extensive literature search using the keywords PXR and bacterial translocation, PXR and chronic liver disease including cirrhosis. In an adequate expression state, PXR acts as a sensor for bile  dysregulation and bacterial derived metabolites, and in response shapes the immune profile beneficial to the host. Activation of PXR could be therapeutic in CLD as it counter-regulates endotoxin mediated inflammation and maintains the integrity of intestinal .

Caecal microbiota composition (Illumina Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene) and key pathways/mediators involved in the control of vascular function, including bile  (BA) profiling,  and liver key gene expression, nitric oxide and  hormones production were also assessed.ITF supplementation totally reverses endothelial dysfunction in mesenteric and carotid arteries of n-3 PUFA-depleted Apoe mice via activation of the nitric oxide (NO) synthase/NO pathway.  microbiota changes induced by prebiotic treatment consist in increased NO-producing bacteria, replenishment of abundance in  and decreased abundance in bacterial taxa involved in secondary BA synthesis. Changes in  and liver gene expression also occur upon ITFs suggesting increased glucagon-like peptide 1 production and BA turnover as drivers of endothelium function preservation.We demonstrate for the first time that ITF improve endothelial dysfunction, implicating a short-term adaptation of both  microbiota and key  peptides. If confirmed in humans, prebiotics could be proposed as a novel approach in the prevention of metabolic disorders-related cardiovascular diseases.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

This transcription factor represses  gene expression in response to retinoic  signaling. In ISX-deficient mice, uncontrolled  gene expression led to increased retinoid production in the intestine. Systemically, this production resulted in highly elevated hepatic retinoid stores. In the intestine, it increased the expression of retinoic -inducible target genes such as , , and  The β-carotene-inducible disruption of retinoid homeostasis affected -homing and differentiation of lymphocytes and displayed morphologically in large lymphoid follicles along the intestine. Furthermore, it was associated with an infiltration of the pancreas by -derived lymphocytes that manifested as a pancreatic insulitis with β-islet cell destruction and systemic glucose intolerance.

We here showed that the expression of mouse CEACAM1 and CEACAM20 at both mRNA and protein levels was markedly reduced in IECs of the small intestine by the treatment of mice with antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria. The expression of both proteins was also decreased in IECs of the small intestine from germ-free mice, compared with that from control specific-pathogen-free mice. Exposure of intestinal organoids to IFN-γ markedly increased the expression of either CEACAM1 or CEACAM20, whereas the exposure to TNF-α increased the expression of the former protein, but not that of the latter. In contrast, the expression of CEACAM20, but not of CEACAM1, in intestinal organoids was markedly increased by exposure to butyrate, a short-chain fatty  produced by bacterial fermentation in the intestine. Collectively, our results suggest that Gram-positive bacteria promote the mRNA expression of CEACAM1 or CEACAM20 in the small intestine.

Pure SCFA mixtures of various concentrations and compositions were tested using a Caco-2 cell model. SCFAs at a moderate concentration (40-80 mM) improved barrier function without causing damage to the monolayer. In a 40 mM SCFA mixture, the butyrate proportion at 20% and 50% showed both a protective and a reparative effect on the monolayer to disrupting agents (LPS/TNF-α) applied simultaneously or prior to the SCFA mixtures.

Disruption of this homeostasis is associated with disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the mechanisms of this process are not clear. We investigated how Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a conserved mammalian NAD-dependent protein deacetylase, senses environmental stress to alter intestinal integrity.We performed studies of mice with disruption of Sirt1 specifically in the intestinal  (SIRT1 iKO, villin-Cre+, Sirt1 mice) and control mice (villin-Cre-, Sirt1) on a C57BL/6 background. Acute colitis was induced in some mice by addition of 2.5% dextran sodium sulfate to drinking water for 5-9 consecutive days. Some mice were given antibiotics via their drinking water for 4 weeks to deplete their microbiota. Some mice were fed with a cholestyramine-containing diet for 7 days to sequester their bile . Feces were collected and proportions of microbiota were analyzed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR. Intestines were collected from mice and gene expression profiles were compared by microarray and quantitative PCR analyses. We compared levels of specific mRNAs between colon tissues from age-matched patients with ulcerative colitis (n=10) vs without IBD (n=8, controls).Mice with intestinal deletion of SIRT1 (SIRT1 iKO) had abnormal activation of Paneth cells starting at the age of 5-8 months, with increased activation of NF-κB, stress pathways, and spontaneous inflammation at 22-24 months of age, compared with control mice. SIRT1 iKO mice also had altered fecal microbiota starting at 4-6 months of age compared with control mice, in part because of altered bile  metabolism. Moreover, SIRT1 iKO mice with defective  microbiota developed more severe colitis than control mice. Intestinal tissues from patients with ulcerative colitis expressed significantly lower levels of SIRT1 mRNA than controls. Intestinal tissues from SIRT1 iKO mice given antibiotics, however, did not have signs of inflammation at 22-24 months of age, and did not develop more severe colitis than control mice at 4-6 months.In analyses of intestinal tissues, colitis induction, and  microbiota in mice with intestinal epithelial disruption of SIRT1, we found this protein to prevent intestinal inflammation by regulating the  microbiota. SIRT1 might therefore be an important mediator of host-microbiome interactions. Agents designed to activate SIRT1 might be developed as treatments for IBDs.Copyright © 2017 AGA Institute.

The mechanism of action of these cofactors is unknown, but an increase of gliadin absorption has been speculated. Our objectives were to study gliadin absorption with and without cofactors and to correlate plasma gliadin levels with factors influencing protein absorption in healthy volunteers.Twelve healthy probands (six males, six females; aged 20-56 years) ingested 32 g of gluten without any cofactor or in combination with cofactors aerobic and anaerobic exercise, ASA, alcohol and pantoprazole. Gliadin serum levels were measured up to 120 min afterwards and the intestinal barrier function protein zonulin in stool was collected before and after the procedure; both were measured by ELISA. Stool microbiota profile was obtained by 16S gene sequencing.Within 15 min after gluten intake, gliadin concentrations in blood serum increased from baseline in all subjects reaching highly variable peak levels after 15-90 min. Addition of cofactors did not lead to substantially higher gliadin levels, although variability of levels was higher with differences between individuals (p < 0.001) and increased levels at later time points. Zonulin levels in stool were associated neither with addition of cofactors nor with peak gliadin concentrations.

Patients with WDEIA may have a predisposition needed for the additional effect of cofactors, e.g., hyperresponsive or damaged intestinal . Alternatively, other mechanisms, such as cofactor-induced blood flow redistribution, increased activity of tissue transglutaminase, or increases in plasma osmolality and acidosis inducing basophil and mast cell histamine release may play the major role in WDEIA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27577581> Microbiota Promote Angiotensin II-Induced Arterial Hypertension and Vascular Dysfunction.</a></h1><p>The  microbiome is essential for physiological host responses and development of immune functions.

Interestingly, aberrant reactivation of several HERV-H loci appears specific to colorectal carcinoma (CRC).The expression of HERV-H Gag proteins (Gag-H) was assessed using novel monoclonal mouse anti Gag-H antibodies. In a flow cytometry screen four antibody clones were tested on a panel of primary CRC cell lines and the most well performing ones were subsequently validated in western blot analysis. Finally, Gag-H protein expression was analyzed by immune histology on cell line cytospins and on clinical samples. There, we found a heterogeneous staining pattern with no background staining of endothelial, stromal and infiltrating immune cells but diffuse staining of the cytoplasm for positive tumor and normal crypt cells of the colonic .Taken together, the Gag-H antibody clone(s) present a valuable tool for staining of cells with colonic origin and thus form the basis for future more detailed investigations. The observed Gag-H protein staining in colonic  crypt cells demands profound analyses of a potential role for Gag-H in the normal physiology of the human .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604999>Small molecule FAK activator promotes human intestinal epithelial monolayer wound closure and mouse ulcer healing.</a></h1><p>GI mucosal healing requires epithelial sheet migration. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase (FAK) stimulates epithelial motility. A virtual screen identified the small drug-like FAK mimic ZINC40099027, which activates FAK. We assessed whether ZINC40099027 promotes FAK-Tyr-397 phosphorylation and wound healing in Caco-2 monolayers and two mouse intestinal injury models. Murine small bowel ulcers were generated by topical serosal acetic  or subcutaneous indomethacin in C57BL/6J mice. One day later, we began treatment with ZINC40099027 or DMSO, staining the mucosa for phosphorylated FAK and Ki-67 and measuring mucosal ulcer area, serum creatinine, ALT, and body weight at day 4. ZINC40099027 (10-1000 nM) dose-dependently activated FAK phosphorylation, without activating Pyk2-Tyr-402 or Src-Tyr-419. ZINC40099027 did not stimulate proliferation, and stimulated wound closure independently of proliferation. The FAK inhibitor PF-573228 prevented ZINC40099027-stimulated wound closure. In both mouse ulcer models, ZINC40099027accelerated mucosal wound healing. FAK phosphorylation was increased in jejunal  at the ulcer edge, and Ki-67 staining was unchanged in jejunal mucosa. ZINC40099027 serum concentration at sacrifice resembled the effective concentration in vitro. Weight, creatinine and ALT did not differ between groups. Small molecule FAK activators can specifically promote epithelial restitution and mucosal healing and may be useful to treat  mucosal injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27849596>Genome-wide screen identifies host colonization determinants in a bacterial  symbiont.</a></h1><p>Animal guts are often colonized by host-specialized bacterial species to the exclusion of other transient microorganisms, but the genetic basis of colonization ability is largely unknown. The bacterium Snodgrassella alvi is a dominant  symbiont in honey bees, specialized in colonizing the hindgut . We developed methods for transposon-based mutagenesis in S. alvi and, using high-throughput DNA sequencing, screened genome-wide transposon insertion (Tn-seq) and transcriptome (RNA-seq) libraries to characterize both the essential genome and the genes facilitating host colonization. Comparison of Tn-seq results from laboratory cultures and from monoinoculated worker bees reveal that 519 of 2,226 protein-coding genes in S. alvi are essential in culture, whereas 399 are not essential but are beneficial for  colonization. Genes facilitating colonization fall into three broad functional categories: extracellular interactions, metabolism, and stress responses. Extracellular components with strong fitness benefits in vivo include trimeric autotransporter adhesins, O antigens, and type IV pili (T4P). Experiments with T4P mutants establish that T4P in S. alvi likely function in attachment and biofilm formation, with knockouts experiencing a competitive disadvantage in vivo. Metabolic processes promoting colonization include essential amino  biosynthesis and iron acquisition pathways, implying nutrient scarcity within the hindgut environment. Mechanisms to deal with various stressors, such as for the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks and protein quality control, are also critical in vivo. This genome-wide study identifies numerous genetic networks underlying colonization by a  commensal in its native host environment, including some known from more targeted studies in other host-microbe symbioses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27927266>Enzymatically modified starch up-regulates expression of incretins and sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter in jejunum of growing pigs.</a></h1><p>Dietary effects on the host are mediated via modulation of the intestinal mucosal responses. The present study investigated the effect of an enzymatically modified starch (EMS) product on the mucosal expression of genes related to starch digestion, sugar and short-chain fatty  (SCFA) absorption and incretins in the jejunum and cecum in growing pigs. Moreover, the impact of the EMS on hepatic expression of genes related to glucose and lipid metabolism, and postprandial serum metabolites were assessed. Barrows (n=12/diet; initial BW 29 kg) were individually fed three times daily with free access to a diet containing either EMS or waxy corn starch as control (CON) for 10 days. The enzymatic modification led to twice as many α-1,6-glycosidic bonds (~8%) in the amylopectin fraction in the EMS in comparison with the non-modified native waxy corn starch (4% α-1,6-glycosidic bonds). Linear discriminant analysis revealed distinct clustering of mucosal gene expression for EMS and CON diets in jejunum. Compared with the CON diet, the EMS intake up-regulated jejunal expression of sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter (SMCT), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) (P<0.05) and intestinal alkaline phosphatase (ALPI) (P=0.08), which may be related to greater luminal SCFA availability, whereas cecal gene expression was unaffected by diet. Hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) expression tended (P=0.07) to be down-regulated in pigs fed the EMS diet compared with pigs fed the CON diet, which may explain the trend (P=0.08) of 30% decrease in serum triglycerides in pigs fed the EMS diet. Furthermore, pigs fed the EMS diet had a 50% higher (P=0.03) serum urea concentration than pigs fed the CON diet potentially indicating an increased use of glucogenic amino  for energy acquisition in these pigs. Present findings suggested the jejunum as the target site to influence the intestinal  and altered lipid and carbohydrate metabolism by EMS feeding.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30026849>Effects of the intestinal microbial metabolite butyrate on the development of colorectal cancer.</a></h1><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the major health threats in developed countries. Changes in dietary components, such as more protein and lipid intake, can increase the risk of CRC. Diet affects CRC in many ways. They regulate the composition and function of  microbiota, which have an amazing metabolic capacity and can produce short chain fatty  (SCFAs), such as propionate, acetate, and butyrate. Butyrate is a principal energy source for colonic epithelial cells and plays an important role in maintaining the stability of  microbiota and the integrity of intestinal . However, there are few studies reviewing the anti-CRC potentials of butyrate. This review summarizes the recent research progresses in the effect of  microbiota imbalance and the decrease in intestinal microbial metabolite butyrate caused by unbalanced diet on CRC development, and discusses the mechanisms of butyrate-induced anti-CRC activities, which may guide people to prevent CRC by improving diet structures.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28245885>Olive oil bioactive compounds increase body weight, and improve  health and integrity in gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata).</a></h1><p>An olive oil bioactive extract (OBE) rich in bioactive compounds like polyphenols, triterpenic , long-chain fatty alcohols, unsaturated hydrocarbons, tocopherols and sterols was tested (0, 0·08, 0·17, 0·42 and 0·73 % OBE) in diets fed to sea bream (Sparus aurata) (initial weight: 5·4 (sd 1·2) g) during a 90-d trial (four replicates). Fish fed diets containing 0·17 and 0·42 % OBE were 5 % heavier (61·1 (sd 1·6) and 60·3 (sd 1·1) g, respectively) than those of the control group (57·0 (sd 0·7) g), although feed conversion ratio and specific feed intake did not vary. There were no differences in lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, catalase, glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase activities in the intestine and liver, although there was a tendency of lower intestinal and hepatic LPO levels in fish fed OBE diets. No differences in villus size were found among treatments, whereas goblet cell density in the control group was on average14·3 % lower than in fish fed OBE diets. The transcriptomic profiling of intestinal markers, covering different biological functions like (i) cell differentiation and proliferation, (ii) intestinal permeability, (iii) enterocyte mass and epithelial damage, (iv) IL and cytokines, (v) pathogen recognition receptors and (vi) mitochondria function, indicated that among the eighty-eight evaluated genes, twenty-nine were differentially expressed (0·17 % OBE diet), suggesting that the additive has the potential of improving the condition and defensive role of the intestine by enhancing the maturation of enterocytes, reducing oxidative stress, improving the integrity of the intestinal  and enhancing the intestinal innate immune function, as gene expression data indicated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27657039>Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside: Physical-Chemistry, Foodomics and Health Effects.</a></h1><p>Anthocyanins (ACNs) are plant secondary metabolites from the flavonoid family. Red to blue fruits are major dietary sources of ACNs (up to 1 g/100 g FW), being cyanidin-3--glucoside (Cy3G) one of the most widely distributed. Cy3G confers a red hue to fruits, but its content in raspberries and strawberries is low. It has a good radical scavenging capacity (RSC) against superoxide but not hydroxyl radicals, and its oxidative potential is pH-dependent (58 mV/pH unit). After intake, Cy3G can be metabolized (phases I, II) by oral epithelial cells, absorbed by the gastric  (1%-10%) and it is -transformed (phase II &amp; microbial metabolism), reaching the bloodstream (<1%) and urine (about 0.02%) in low amounts. In humans and Caco-2 cells, Cy3G's major metabolites are protocatechuic  and phloroglucinaldehyde which are also subjected to entero-hepatic recycling, although caffeic  and peonidin-3-glucoside seem to be strictly produced in the large bowel and renal tissues. Solid evidence supports Cy3G's bioactivity as DNA-RSC, gastro protective, anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic chemo-preventive and as an epigenetic factor, exerting protection against  infection, age-related diseases, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and oral cancer. Most relevant mechanisms include RSC, epigenetic action, competitive protein-binding and enzyme inhibition. These and other novel aspects on Cy3G's physical-chemistry, foodomics, and health effects are discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27664183>Microbial short chain fatty  metabolites lower blood pressure via endothelial G protein-coupled receptor 41.</a></h1><p>Short chain fatty  (SCFA) metabolites are byproducts of  microbial metabolism that are known to affect host physiology via host G protein-coupled receptor (GPCRs). We previously showed that an acute SCFA bolus decreases blood pressure (BP) in anesthetized mice, an effect mediated primarily via Gpr41. In this study, our aims were to identify the cellular localization of Gpr41 and to determine its role in BP regulation. We localized Gpr41 to the vascular endothelium using RT-PCR: Gpr41 is detected in intact vessels (with endothelium) but is absent from denuded vessels (without endothelium). Furthermore, using pressure myography we confirmed that SCFAs dilate resistance vessels in an endothelium-dependent manner. Since we previously found that Gpr41 mediates a hypotensive response to acute SCFA administration, we hypothesized that Gpr41 knockout (KO) mice would be hypertensive. Here, we report that Gpr41 KO mice have isolated systolic hypertension compared with wild-type (WT) mice; diastolic BP was not different between WT and KO. Older Gpr41 KO mice also exhibited elevated pulse wave velocity, consistent with a phenotype of systolic hypertension; however, there was no increase in ex vivo aorta stiffness (measured by mechanical tensile testing). Plasma renin concentrations were also similar in KO and WT mice. The systolic hypertension in Gpr41 KO is not salt sensitive, as it is not significantly altered on either a high- or low-salt diet. In sum, these studies suggest that endothelial Gpr41 lowers baseline BP, likely by decreasing active vascular tone without altering passive characteristics of the blood vessels, and that Gpr41 KO mice have hypertension of a vascular origin.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035616>Protection of the Ovine Fetal  against -Induced Chorioamnionitis: A Potential Role for Plant Sterols.</a></h1><p>Chorioamnionitis, clinically most frequently associated with , is linked to intestinal inflammation and subsequent  injury. No treatment is available to prevent chorioamnionitis-driven adverse intestinal outcomes. Evidence is increasing that plant sterols possess immune-modulatory properties. Therefore, we investigated the potential therapeutic effects of plant sterols in lambs intra-amniotically (IA) exposed to . Fetal lambs were IA exposed to  (, UP) for six days from 127 d-133 d of gestational age (GA). The plant sterols β-sitosterol and campesterol, dissolved with β-cyclodextrin (carrier), were given IA every two days from 122 d-131 d GA. Fetal circulatory cytokine levels,  inflammation, intestinal injury, enterocyte maturation, and mucosal phospholipid and bile  profiles were measured at 133 d GA (term 150 d). IA plant sterol administration blocked a fetal inflammatory response syndrome. Plant sterols reduced intestinal accumulation of proinflammatory phospholipids and tended to prevent mucosal myeloperoxidase-positive (MPO) cell influx, indicating an inhibition of  inflammation. IA administration of plant sterols and carrier diminished intestinal mucosal damage, stimulated maturation of the immature , and partially prevented -driven reduction of mucosal bile . In conclusion, we show that β-sitosterol and campesterol administration protected the fetus against adverse  outcomes following UP-driven chorioamnionitis by preventing intestinal and systemic inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29944342>Laser Ablation as a Versatile Tool To Mimic Polyethylene Terephthalate Nanoplastic Pollutants: Characterization and Toxicology Assessment.</a></h1><p>The presence of micro- and nanoplastics in the marine environment is raising strong concerns since they can possibly have a negative impact on human health. In particular, the lack of appropriate methodologies to collect the nanoplastics from water systems imposes the use of engineered model nanoparticles to explore their interactions with biological systems, with results not easily correlated with the real case conditions. In this work, we propose a reliable top-down approach based on laser ablation of polymers to form polyethylene terephthalate (PET) nanoplastics, which mimic real environmental nanopollutants, unlike synthetic samples obtained by colloidal chemistry. PET nanoparticles were carefully characterized in terms of chemical/physical properties and stability in different media. The nanoplastics have a ca. 100 nm average dimension, with significant size and shape heterogeneity, and they present weak  groups on their surface, similarly to photodegraded PET plastics. Despite no toxic effects emerging by in vitro studies on human Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells, the formed nanoplastics were largely internalized in endolysosomes, showing intracellular biopersistence and long-term stability in a simulated lysosomal environment. Interestingly, when tested on a model of intestinal , nano-PET showed high propensity to cross the  barrier, with unpredictable long-term effects on health and potential transport of dispersed chemicals mediated by the nanopollutants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29523750>Altered microbiome in chronic kidney disease: systemic effects of -derived uremic toxins.</a></h1><p>In chronic kidney disease (CKD), influx of urea and other retained toxins exerts a change in the  microbiome. There is decreased number of beneficial bacteria that produce short-chain fatty , an essential nutrient for the colonic , concurrent with an increase in bacteria that produce uremic toxins such as indoxyl sulphate, -cresyl sulphate, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Due to intestinal wall inflammation and degradation of intercellular tight junctions, -derived uremic toxins translocate into the bloodstream and exert systemic effects. In this review, we discuss the evidence supporting a role for -derived uremic toxins in promoting multiorgan dysfunction via inflammatory, oxidative stress, and apoptosis pathways. End-organ effects include vascular calcification, kidney fibrosis, anemia, impaired immune system, adipocyte dysfunction with insulin resistance, and low turnover bone disease. Higher blood levels of -derived uremic toxins are associated with increased cardiovascular events and mortality in the CKD population. Clinical trials that have examined interventions to trap toxic products or reverse  microbial dysbiosis via oral activated charcoal AST-120, prebiotics and probiotics have not shown impact on cardiovascular or survival outcomes but were limited by sample size and short trials. In summary, the  microbiome is a major contributor to adverse cardiovascular outcomes and progression of CKD.© 2018 The Author(s).

The glycocalyx on the vascular endothelium helps maintain its normal function through multiple mechanisms, including regulation of vascular permeability and inhibition of intercellular adhesion. It is unknown that whether pancreatitis inflicts injuries to the intestinal mucosal barrier through damaging glycocalyx or stabilizing glycocalyx can be a potential therapeutic target in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier during SAP. Injecting sodium taurocholate into the pancreatic duct of Sprague-Dawley rats induced SAP. Intestinal perfusion, changes in endothelial glycocalyx, and the associated molecular mechanisms were assessed by laser Doppler velocimetry, electron microscopy, and the levels of heparan sulfate, syndacan-1, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the superior mesenteric vein. Protective effects of hydrocortisone treatment in the intestinal microcirculation during SAP were evaluated. Degradation of the glycocalyx in intestinal vascular endothelium developed 3 h after the onset of SAP in rats. By 12 h, significant reduction of intestinal perfusion was observed. The concomitant elevated levels of TNF-α in the superior mesenteric vein suggest that TNF-α is involved in the degradation of the glycocalyx. With the use of hydrocortisone, intestinal perfusion was improved and the degradation of glycocalyx was reduced. The degradation of glycocalyx is involved in the malfunction of the intestinal microcirculation. The massive release of TNF-α participates in this process and leads to glycocalyx degradation. Hydrocortisone may be a good therapy to prevent this process.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26606879>Fermentation of bioactive solid lipid nanoparticles by human  microflora.</a></h1><p>Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) can be used for oral delivery of phenolic compounds in order to protect them from the harsh conditions of digestion and improve their bioavailability in the intestinal . Recently, the production and characterization of SLNs loaded with rosmarinic  (RA) and herbal extracts was performed for future use as functional food ingredients. Diet components have been shown to have a huge impact on  microbiota viability and metabolic activity. Hence, SLNs loaded with RA, sage and savoury extracts have been evaluated for their effect on intestinal microbiota growth and the metabolic products generated. Fermentations in anaerobic batch cultures using volunteer human faeces were performed during 24 h. Dynamic bacterial population changes were analysed using PCR-real time, as well as the generation of fatty  and the quantification of phenolic compounds by analytical methods. Solid lipid nanoparticles released phenolic compounds at non-inhibitory bacterial growth concentrations. Released herbal extract phenolic compounds showed a beneficial effect on  microbiota growth (e.g. bifidogenic effects) and were used as substrates. Acetate, formate, lactate and butyrate were produced in higher concentrations. The released phenolic compounds also induced PUFA and trans fatty  metabolic activity, the production of saturated fatty , as well of potential beneficial conjugated linoleic  isomers.

This study investigated the influence of propolis on the  microbiota and intestinal mucosa in rats with diabetes.Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned to the control group, model group, and three propolis groups (supplemented with 80, 160, and 240 mg/kg·bw propolis, respectively). A high-fat diet combined with a streptozotocin (STZ) abdominal injection were used to induce diabetes in the rats. After 4 weeks, the intestinal histopathological analysis of the ileum was observed by transmission electron microscopy. The fasting blood glucose (FBG), plasma insulin, glucose tolerance (OGTT) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were measured. The expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins in the ileum was measured using western blotting. The molecular ecology of the fecal  microbiota was analyzed by 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing. The contents of the short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) in feces were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).After propolis treatment, compared to the model group, FBG and HbA1c levels declined, while the glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity index (ISI) increased. The levels of TJ proteins in the ileum increased in the propolis groups. The tight junctions and gap junctions of the intestinal  were also improved in the propolis groups. The contents of the feces acetic , propionic  and butyrate were increased in the propolis groups. 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing revealed that the composition of the  microbiota of rats in the propolis supplement group was significantly improved.Compared to the model group, propolis exerted hypoglycemic effects in diabetic rats, and it repaired intestinal mucosal damage, benefited the communities of the  microbiota and increased SCFA levels in diabetic rats.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this study, a combination of proteomic and metabolomic approaches was applied to evaluate metabolic and proteomic changes of the rumen  in goats fed a hay diet (Hay) or HG diet. At the metabolome level, results from principal component analysis (PCA) and PLS-DA revealed clear differences in the biochemical composition of ruminal tissue of the control (Hay) and the grain-fed groups, demonstrating the evident impact of HG feeding on metabolite profile of ruminal epithelial tissues. As compared with the Hay group, HG feeding increased the levels of eight metabolites and decreased the concentrations of seven metabolites in ruminal epithelial tissues. HG feeding mainly altered starch and sucrose metabolism, purine metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, glycolysis or gluconeogenesis, galactose metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, and arginine and proline metabolism in ruminal . At the proteome level, 35 differentially expressed proteins were found in the rumen  between the Hay and HG groups, with 12 upregulated and 23 downregulated proteins. The downregulated proteins were related to fatty  metabolism, carbohydrate metabolic processes and nucleoside metabolic processes, while most of upregulated proteins were involved in oxidative stress and detoxification. In general, our findings revealed that HG feeding resulted in differential proteomic and metabolomic profiles in the rumen epithelia of goats, which may contribute to better understanding how rumen  adapt to HG feeding.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26308719>Lipid Classes and Fatty  in Ophryotrocha cyclops, a Dorvilleid from Newfoundland Aquaculture Sites.</a></h1><p>A new opportunistic annelid (Ophryotrocha cyclops) discovered on benthic substrates underneath finfish aquaculture sites in Newfoundland (NL) may be involved in the remediation of organic wastes. At those aquaculture sites, bacterial mats and O. cyclops often coexist and are used as indicators of organic enrichment. Little is known on the trophic strategies used by these annelids, including whether they might consume bacteria or other aquaculture-derived wastes. We studied the lipid and fatty  composition of the annelids and their potential food sources (degraded flocculent organic matter, fresh fish pellets and bacterial mats) to investigate feeding relationships in these habitats and compared the lipid and fatty  composition of annelids before and after starvation. Fish pellets were rich in lipids, mainly terrestrially derived C18 fatty  (18:1ω9, 18:2ω6, 18:3ω3), while bacterial samples were mainly composed of ω7 fatty , and flocculent matter appeared to be a mixture of fresh and degrading fish pellets, feces and bacteria. Ophryotrocha cyclops did not appear to store excessive amounts of lipids (13%) but showed a high concentration of ω3 and ω6 fatty , as well as a high proportion of the main fatty  contained in fresh fish pellets and bacterial mats. The dorvilleids and all potential food sources differed significantly in their lipid and fatty  composition. Interestingly, while all food sources contained low proportions of 20:5ω3 and 20:2ω6, the annelids showed high concentrations of these two fatty , along with 20:4ω6. A starvation period of 13 days did not result in a major decrease in total lipid content; however, microscopic observations revealed that very few visible lipid droplets remained in the   after three months of starvation. Ophryotrocha cyclops appears well adapted to extreme environments and may rely on lipid-rich organic matter for survival and dispersal in cold environments.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27259642>Amyloidogenic behavior of different intermediate state of stem bromelain: A biophysical insight.</a></h1><p>Stem bromelain, a cysteine proteases from Ananas comosus is a widely accepted therapeutic drug with broad medicinal application. It exists as intermediate states at pH 2.0 and 10.0, where it encountered in gastrointestinal tract during adsorption (acidic pH) and in   (alkaline pH), respectively. In this study, we monitored the thermal aggregation/amyloid formation of SB at different pH intermediate states. Thermal treatment of stem bromelain at pH 10.0 favors the fibrillation in which the extent of aggregation increases with increase in protein concentration. However, no fibril formation in stem bromelain at pH 2.0 was found at all the concentration used at pH 10.0. The fibril formation was confirmed by various techniques such as turbidity measurements, Rayleigh light scattering, dye binding assays and far UV circular dichroism. The Dynamic light scattering confirmed the formation of aggregates by measuring the hydrodynamic radii pattern. Moreover, microscopic techniques were performed to analyze the morphology of fibrils. The aggregation behavior may be due to variation in number of charged amino  residues. The less negative charge developed at pH 10.0 may be responsible for aggregation. This work helps to overcome the aggregation related problems of stem bromelain during formulations in pharmaceutical industry.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, dysregulation of the epithelial barrier function can lead to increased intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation across the intestinal mucosa, which contributes to local and systemic immune activation. The increase in these parameters is associated with inflammatory bowel disease, physical exercise under heat stress, intestinal obstruction, ischemia, and mucositis, among other conditions. Lately, there has been growing interest in immunomodulatory nutrients and probiotics that can regulate host immune and inflammatory responses and possibly restore the intestinal barrier. Immunomodulators such as amino  (glutamine, arginine, tryptophan, and citrulline), fatty  (short-chain and omega-3 fatty  and conjugated linoleic ), and probiotics (Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, and Lactobacillus) have been reported in the literature.

Pathophysiological changes linked to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) include stress and immune activation, changes in gastrointestinal microbial and bile  profiles and sensitization of extrinsic and intrinsic  neurons. This review explores the potential role for L-cells in these pathophysiological changes. What advances does it highlight? L-cells, which secrete glucagon-like peptide-1 in response to nutrients, microbial factors, bile  and short-chain fatty , may sense IBS-related changes in the luminal environment. Glucagon-like peptide-1 can act as a hormone, a paracrine factor or a neuromodulatory factor and, through its actions on central or peripheral neurons, may play a role in gastrointestinal dysfunction.The prevalent and debilitating functional bowel disorder, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), is characterized by symptoms that include abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhoea and/or constipation. The heterogeneity of IBS underscores a complex multifactorial pathophysiology, which is not completely understood but involves dysfunction of the bi-directional signalling axis between the brain and the . This axis incorporates efferent and afferent branches of the autonomic nervous system, circulating endocrine hormones and immune factors, local paracrine and neurocrine factors and microbial metabolites. L-cells, which are electrically excitable biosensors embedded in the gastrointestinal , secrete glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in response to nutrients in the small intestine. However, they appear to function in a different manner more distally in the gastrointestinal tract, where they are activated by luminal factors including short-chain fatty , bile  and microbial metabolic products, all of which are altered in IBS patients. Glucagon-like peptide-1 can also interact with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress axis and the immune system, both of which are activated in IBS. Given that a GLP-1 mimetic has been found to alleviate acute pain symptoms in IBS patients, GLP-1 might be important in the manifestation of IBS symptoms. This review assesses the current knowledge about the role of GLP-1 in IBS pathophysiology and its potential role as a signal transducer in the microbiome--brain signalling axis.© 2018 The Authors.

The current study was therefore designed to investigate the effects of C. jejuni on glucose uptake, amino  availability in digesta, and intracellular calcium [Ca(2+)]i signaling in the intestines of broiler chickens. For this, we compared: control birds (n = 60) and C. jejuni-infected birds (n = 60; infected orally with 1 × 10(8) CFU of C. jejuni NCTC 12744 at 14 days of age). Our results showed that glucose uptake was reduced due to C. jejuni infection in isolated jejunal, but not in cecal mucosa at 14 days postinfection (dpi). The decrease in intestinal glucose absorption coincided with a decrease in body weight gain during the 2-week post-infectious period. A reduction in the amount of the amino  (serine, proline, valine, leucine, phenylalanine, arginine, histidine, and lysine) in ileal digesta of the infected birds at 2 and/or 7 dpi was found, indicating that Campylobacter utilizes amino  as a carbon source for their multiplication. Applying the cell-permeable Ca(2+) indicator Fluo-4 and two-photon microscopy, we revealed that [Ca(2+)]i was increased in the jejunal and cecal mucosa of infected birds. The muscarinic agonist carbachol induced an increase in [Ca(2+)]i in jejunum and cecum mucosa of control chickens, a response absent in the mucosa of infected chickens, demonstrating that the modulation of [Ca(2+)]i by Campylobacter might be involved in facilitating the necessary cytoskeletal rearrangements that occur during the bacterial invasion of epithelial cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the multifaceted interactions of C. jejuni with the gastrointestinal mucosa of broiler chickens. For the first time, it could be shown that a Campylobacter infection could interfere with intracellular Ca(2+) signaling and nutrient absorption in the small intestine with consequences on intestinal function, performance, and Campylobacter colonization. Altogether, these findings indicate that Campylobacter is not entirely a commensal and can be recognized as an important factor contributing to an impaired chicken  health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28648659>Enterochromaffin Cells Are  Chemosensors that Couple to Sensory Neural Pathways.</a></h1><p>Dietary, microbial, and inflammatory factors modulate the -brain axis and influence physiological processes ranging from metabolism to cognition. The   is a principal site for detecting such agents, but precisely how it communicates with neural elements is poorly understood. Serotonergic enterochromaffin (EC) cells are proposed to fulfill this role by acting as chemosensors, but understanding how these rare and unique cell types transduce chemosensory information to the nervous system has been hampered by their paucity and inaccessibility to single-cell measurements. Here, we circumvent this limitation by exploiting cultured intestinal organoids together with single-cell measurements to elucidate intrinsic biophysical, pharmacological, and genetic properties of EC cells. We show that EC cells express specific chemosensory receptors, are electrically excitable, and modulate serotonin-sensitive primary afferent nerve fibers via synaptic connections, enabling them to detect and transduce environmental, metabolic, and homeostatic information from the  directly to the nervous system.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

CDX2 activation in IM is driven by reflux of bile  and following chronic inflammation. But the mechanism underlying how bile  activate CDX2 in gastric  has not been fully explored.We performed microRNA (miRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) profiling using microarray in cells treated with bile . Data integration of the miRNA/mRNA profiles with gene ontology (GO) analysis and bioinformatics was performed to detect potential miRNA-mRNA regulatory circuits. Transfection of gastric cancer cell lines with miRNA mimics and inhibitors was used to evaluate their effects on the expression of candidate targets and functions. Immunohistochemistry and in situhybridisation were used to detect the expression of selected miRNAs and their targets in IM tissue microarrays.We demonstrate a bile -triggered pathway involving upregulation of miR-92a-1-5p and suppression of its target FOXD1 in gastric cells. We first found that miR-92a-1-5p was increased in IM tissues and induced by bile . Moreover, miR-92a-1-5p was found to activate CDX2 and downstream intestinal markers by targeting FOXD1/FOXJ1 axis and modulating activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. Furthermore, these effects were found to be clinical relevant, as high miR-92a-1-5p levels were correlated with low FOXD1 levels and high CDX2 levels in IM tissues.These findings suggest a miR-92a-1-5p/FOXD1/NF-κB/CDX2 regulatory axis plays key roles in the generation of IM phenotype from gastric cells. Suppression of miR-92a-1-5p and restoration of FOXD1 may be a preventive approach for gastric IM in patients with bile regurgitation.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Our aim was to evaluate the intestinal morphology and nutrients transporters content in mice fed standard (LFD) or high fat (HFD) diets in hypo or hyperthyroidism-induced condition.C57BL/6 male mice fed LFD or HFD diets for 12 weeks, followed by saline, PTU (antithyroid drug) or T3 treatment up to 30 days. The mice were euthanized and proximal intestine was removed to study GLUT2, GLUT5, PEPT1, FAT-CD36, FATP4, NPC1L1 and NHE3 distribution by Western blotting. Since PPAR-a is activated by fatty , which is abundant in the HFD, we also evaluated whether PPAR-a affects nutrients transporters. Thus, mice were treated with fenofibrate, a PPAR-a agonist.HFD decreased GLUT2, PEPT1, FAT-CD6 and NPC1L1, but increased NHE3, while GLUT5 and FATP4 remained unaltered. THs did not alter distribution of nutrients transporters neither in LFD nor in HFD groups, but they increased villi length and depth crypt in LFD and HFD, respectively. Fenofibrate did not affect content of nutrients transporters, excluding PPAR-a involvement on the HFD-induced changes.We assume that chronic HFD consumption reduced most of the nutrients transporters content in the small intestine of mice, which might limit the entrance of nutrients and gain weight. Since NHE3 promotes sodium absorption, and it was increased in HFD group, this finding could contribute to explain the hypertension observed in obesity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Weaning stress impairs piglet intestinal  structural and functional integrities, which results in reduced feed intake, growth rates and increased morbidity and mortality. Several measures are needed to maintain swine  development and growth performance after weaning stress. A large body of evidence indicates that, in weaning piglets, glutamine, a functional amino , may improve growth performance and intestinal morphology, reduce oxidative damage, stimulate enterocyte proliferation, modulate cell survival and death and enhance intestinal paracellular permeability. This review focuses on the effects of glutamine on intestinal health in piglets.

In order to improve our understanding on the digestive system and feeding of this species, morphological and histological features of the  were studied. Morphologically, the Asian seabass  is defined by a short and muscular esophagus, well-developed stomach and comparatively short intestine. Mucous secreting goblet cells reactive to PAS (Periodic  Schiff) and AB (Alcian Blue) stain were present throughout the esophagus. The stomach was sac-like and could be distinguished into the cardiac, fundic and pyloric regions. Gastric glands and mucus cells were predominately present in the cardiac and fundic regions. Five finger-like pyloric caeca were present between the stomach and intestine. The intestine was a short, tubular structure with no morphological differences between the various regions. Histologically, the intestinal regions were similar, the main difference being in the number of goblet cells that increased from anterior to posterior intestine, with 114 ± 9, 153 ± 7 and 317 ± 21 goblet cells in the anterior, mid and posterior regions, respectively. The intestinal  stained positively for PAS, but the staining was stronger for acidic glycoproteins. The rectum was similar to intestine, except for increased goblet cell numbers (anterior rectum: 529 ± 26; posterior rectum: 745 ± 29).  morpho-histology did not respond to salinity changes, however, there was a significant reduction of mucosal height, goblet cell numbers and muscularis thickness upon food deprivation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29746173>Induction of  proteasome activity in hemorrhagic shock and its recovery by treatment with diphenyldihaloketones CLEFMA and EF24.</a></h1><p>Multiorgan failure in hemorrhagic shock is triggered by  barrier dysfunction and consequent systemic infiltration of proinflammatory factors. Our previous study has shown that diphenyldihaloketone drugs 4-[3,5-bis[(2-chlorophenyl)methylene]-4-oxo-1-piperidinyl]-4-oxo-2-butenoic  (CLEFMA) and 3,5-bis[(2-fluorophenyl)methylene]-4-piperidinone (EF24) restore  barrier dysfunction and reduce systemic inflammatory response in hemorrhagic shock. We investigated the effect of hemorrhagic shock on proteasome activity of intestinal  and how CLEFMA and EF24 treatments modulate proteasome function in hemorrhagic shock. CLEFMA or EF24 (0.4 mg/kg) were given 1 h after withdrawing 50% of blood from Sprague-Dawley rats; no other resuscitation was provided. After another 5 h of compensation, small  was collected to process tissue for proteasome activity, immunoblotting, and mRNA levels of genes responsible for unfolded-protein response (XBP1, ATF4, glucose-regulated protein of 78/95 kDa, and growth arrest and DNA damage inducible genes 153/34), polyubiquitin B and C, and immunoproteasome subunits β type-8 and -10 and proteasome activator subunit 1. We found that hemorrhagic shock induced proteasome activity in  tissue and reduced the amounts of ubiquitinated proteins displayed on antiubiquitin immunoblots. However, simultaneous induction of unfolded-protein response or immunoproteasome genes was not observed. CLEFMA and EF24 treatments abolished the hemorrhagic shock-induced increase in proteasome activity. Further investigations revealed that the induction of proteasome in hemorrhagic shock is associated with disassembly of 26S proteasome; CLEFMA and EF24 prevented this disassembly. Consistent with these data, CLEFMA and EF24 reduced hemorrhagic shock-induced degradation of 20S substrate ornithine decarboxylase in  tissue. These results suggest that activated proteasome plays an important role in ischemic  pathophysiology, and it can be a druggable target in shock-induced  dysfunction. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Ischemic injury to the  is a trigger for the systemic inflammatory response and multiple organ failure in trauma and hemorrhagic shock.

However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we report that Salmonella infection generates directional electric fields (EFs) in the follicle-associated  of mouse cecum. In vitro application of an EF, mimicking the infection-generated electric field (IGEF), induces directional migration of primary mouse macrophages to the anode, which is reversed to the cathode upon Salmonella infection. This infection-dependent directional switch is independent of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) type III secretion system. The switch is accompanied by a reduction of sialic  on glycosylated surface components during phagocytosis of bacteria, which is absent in macrophages challenged by microspheres. Moreover, enzymatic cleavage of terminally exposed sialic  reduces macrophage surface negativity and severely impairs directional migration of macrophages in response to an EF. Based on these findings, we propose that macrophages are attracted to the site of infection by a combination of chemotaxis and galvanotaxis; after phagocytosis of bacteria, surface electrical properties of the macrophage change, and galvanotaxis directs the cells away from the site of infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30480819>Redefining the signaling pathways from pluripotency to pancreas development: In vitro β-cell differentiation.</a></h1><p>Pancreatic β-cells are destroyed by the immune system, in type 1 diabetes (T1D) and are impaired by glucose insensitivity in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Islet-cells transplantation is a promising therapeutic approach based on in vitro differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to insulin-producing cells (IPCs). According to evolutionary stages in β-cell development, there are several distinct checkpoints; each one has a unique characteristic, including definitive endoderm (DE), primitive  (PG), posterior foregut (PF), pancreatic  (PE), endocrine precursor (EP), and immature β-cells up to functional β-cells. A better understanding of the gene regulatory networks (GRN) and associated transcription factors in each specific developmental stage, guarantees the achievement of the next successful checkpoints and ensures an efficient β-cell differentiation procedure. The new findings in signaling pathways, related to the development of the pancreas are discussed here, including Wnt, Activin/Nodal, FGF, BMP, retinoic  (RA), sonic hedgehog (Shh), Notch, and downstream regulators, required for β-cell commitment. We also summarized different approaches in the IPCs protocol to conceptually define a standardized system, leading to the creation of a reproducible method for β-cell differentiation.

There is an urgent need to find alternatives to antibiotics as many salmonellae are now multidrug resistant. As such, specific beneficial bacteria and dietary fibers can be an alternative as they may prevent  Typhimurium (STM) infection and spreading by strengthening intestinal barrier function.  We tested whether immune active long-chain inulin-type fructans and/or  W37,  W63, and  W56 can strengthen barrier integrity of intestinal Caco-2 cells in the presence and absence of a STM. Effects of the ingredients on intestinal barrier function were first evaluated by quantifying trans-epithelial electric resistance (TEER) and regulation of gene expression by microarray. Only  had effects on TEER and modulated a group of 26 genes related to tight-junctions. Inulin-type fructans,  W63 and  W56 regulated other genes, unrelated to tight-junctions.  also had unique effects on a group of six genes regulating epithelial phenotype toward follicle-associated .  W37 was therefore selected for a challenge with STM and prevented STM-induced barrier disruption and decreased secretion of IL-8.  W37 increases TEER and can protect against STM induced disruption of  epithelial cells integrity . Our results suggest that selection of specific bacterial strains for enforcing barrier function may be a promising strategy to reduce or prevent STM infections.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26919402>Influence of medium-chain fatty  and short-chain organic  on jejunal morphology and intra-epithelial immune cells in weaned piglets.</a></h1><p>Medium-chain fatty  (MCFA) and short-chain organic  (SOA) are often used as feed additives in piglet diets. There are limited studies in pigs describing the impact of MCFA or SOA on  morphology and the local immune system. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the supplementation of SOA (0.41% fumaric  and 0.32% lactic ), or the combination of SOA with MCFA (0.15% caprylic and capric ) would have effects on  morphology and intestinal immune cells in weaned piglets. A total number of 72 weaned piglets were randomly allocated into three experimental groups. Tissue samples of six animals per group were used to investigate the potential impact of the feed additives on villus length and crypt depth of the jejunum and to quantify intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IEL). CD3-positive IEL were determined via immunohistochemistry (IHC) and flow cytometry (FC), whereas CD2-, CD5-, CD8β-, CD16- and γδ TCR-positive IEL were only analysed by FC. The supplementation of MCFA and SOA did not significantly affect morphometric data. The FC data indicated that SOA significantly increased the quantity of CD2 CD8 γδ T cells in the jejunum . Both IHC and FC analyses of pig jejunum confirmed that the majority of IEL expressed the surface marker CD3 and could be classified as cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In conclusion, the data indicated that SOA increased the proportion of CD2 CD8 γδ T cells in the jejunal . Thus, SOA might enable a beneficial effect on the local immunity by increasing the constitutive number of potential effector cells to defeat infectious diseases.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31517482>16α-Hydroxytrametenolic  from  Improves Intestinal Barrier Function Through the Glucocorticoid Receptor-Mediated PI3K/Akt/NF-κB Pathway.</a></h1><p>This study evaluated the effect of triterpenoids from edible mushroom  on intestinal  integrity and revealed the transcriptional regulatory pathways that underpin restorative mechanisms in the . Based on computational docking studies, transcriptional activation experiments and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein immunofluorescence localization assays in cultured cells, 16α-hydroxytrametenolic  (HTA) was discovered as a novel GR agonist in this study. HTA ameliorates TNF-α-induced Caco-2 monolayer intestinal epithelial barrier damage and suppressed activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (Akt), which attenuated downstream IκB and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) phosphorylation through GR activation. Moreover, HTA prevented NF-κB translocation into the nucleus and binding to its cis-element and suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced downstream NO production and pro-inflammatory cytokines at both protein and mRNA expression levels.

ER stress plays a key role in IBD pathogenesis.We investigated whether the influence of MDD on colitis resulted from an ER stress response triggered by decreased SIRT1 expression.The unfolded protein response (UPR), chaperones proteins, heat shock factor protein 1 (HSF1) and SIRT1 were examined in rats with MDD and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in a Caco-2 cell model with stable expression of transcobalamin-oleosin (TO) chimera, which impairs cellular availability of vitamin B12, and in IBD. The effects of SIRT1 activation were studied both in vitro and in vivo.MDD aggravated DSS-induced colitis clinically, endoscopically and histologically. MDD activated ER stress pathways, with increased phosphorylate-PKR-like ER kinase, P-eiF-2α, P-IRE-1α, activating transcription factor (ATF)6, XBP1-S protein and ATF4 mRNA expression levels in rats. This was accompanied by reduced SIRT1 expression level and greater acetylation of HSF1, in relation with a dramatic decrease of chaperones (binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP), heat shock protein (HSP)27 and HSP90). Adding either vitamin B12, S-adenosylmethionine or an SIRT1 activator (SRT1720) reduced the UPR in vitro. In rats, SIRT1 activation by SRT1720 prevented colitis by reducing HSF1 acetylation and increasing expression of BIP, HSP27 and HSP90. Immunohistochemistry showed impaired expression of SIRT1 in the colonic  of patients with IBD.SIRT1 is a master regulator of ER stress and severity of experimental colitis in case of MDD.

Patients who did not meet the diagnostic criteria for IBD and who displayed no evidence of infection or other pathology in the  were included as symptomatic non-IBD controls. AQP1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were quantified in biopsies from the distal ileum and colon by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Protein expression of selected AQPs was assessed by confocal microscopy. Through multiple alignments of the deduced amino  sequences, the putative three-dimensional structures of AQP1, 3, 7, and 8 were modeled.AQP1, 3, 7, and 8 mRNAs were detected in all parts of the intestinal mucosa. Notably, AQP1 and AQP3 mRNA levels were reduced in the ileum of patients with Crohn's disease, and AQP7 and AQP8 mRNA levels were reduced in the ileum and the colon of patients with ulcerative colitis. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy showed localization of AQP3, 7, and 8 at the mucosal , whereas the expression of AQP1 was mainly confined to the endothelial cells and erythrocytes. The reduction in the level of AQP3, 7, and 8 mRNA was confirmed by immunofluorescence, which also indicated a reduction of apical immunolabeling for AQP8 in the colonic surface  and crypts of the IBD samples. This could indicate loss of epithelial polarity in IBD, leading to disrupted barrier function.AQPs 1 and 8 and the aquaglyceroporins AQPs 3 and 7 are the AQPs predominantly expressed in the lower intestinal tract of humans. Their expression is significantly reduced in patients with IBD, and they are differentially expressed in specific bowel segments in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

Nlrp6 modulates the   interaction with the microbiota. However, the expression and function of Nlrp6 in the kidney, a sterile environment, have not been characterized. We explored the role of Nlrp6 in acute kidney injury (AKI).In a transcriptomics array of murine nephrotoxic AKI, Nlrp6 and Naip3 were the only significantly downregulated NLR genes. The functional implications of Nlrp6 downregulation were explored in mice and in cultured murine tubular cells.Nlrp6 was expressed by healthy murine and human kidney tubular , and expression was reduced during human kidney injury or murine nephrotoxic AKI induced by cisplatin or a folic  overdose. Genetic Nlrp6 deficiency resulted in upregulation of kidney extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation and more severe AKI and kidney inflammation. In cultured tubular cells, Nlrp6 downregulation induced by specific small interfering RNA resulted in upregulation of ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation and chemokine messenger RNA expression and downregulation of the nephroprotective gene Klotho. MAPK inhibition prevented the inflammatory response in Nlrp6-deficient cells.Nlrp6 dampens sterile inflammation and has a nephroprotective role during nephrotoxic kidney injury through suppression of MAP kinase activation.© The Author(s) 2019.

The aim was to study the effect of intestinal association with different microbiota and A0 blood group genotypes on the expressed glycomic pattern in the small intestine. Twelve caesarean-derived pigs previously associated with a simple association (SA) or complex association (CA) microbiota were selected at 26 to 37 d of age. In each subject, different jejunal loops were perfused for 8 h with enterotoxigenic K88 (ETEC), ETEC fimbriae (F4), (LAM), or a saline control. The piglets were genotyped for A0 blood group and the glycomic profile was evaluated by microscopic screening of lectin binding: peanut agglutinin (PNA), which is galactose specific; agglutinin I (UEA), which is fucose specific; lectin II (MALii), which is sialic  specific; concavalin A, which is mannose specific; soybean agglutinin (SBA), which is -acetyl-galactosamine specific; and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which is -acetyl-glucosamine specific. A0 pigs had fewer UEA-positive cells, MALii-positive cells ( < 0.001), and SBA-positive cells ( < 0.10) than 00 pigs. Simple association pigs had more SBA positive cells ( < 0.01) than CA pigs. Enterotoxigenic K88-perfused intestinal loops had fewer UEA-positive cells ( < 0.01) and WGA positive cells ( < 0.001) cells and more PNA positive cells (only in SA pigs, < 0.01). No effects of introduction of F4 and LAM in the intestinal lumen were observed. The porcine A0 blood group genotype and the luminal presence of ETEC strongly affected the jejunal mucosa glycomic pattern profile whereas an early oral simple or complex microbial association had limited effects.

Using a multidisciplinary approach we addressed this knowledge gap using the zebrafish model by coupling high-throughput sequencing with biochemical, molecular and morphological analysis to evaluate the changes in the intestine. Analysis of bacterial 16S libraries revealed that Lactobacillus rhamnosus was able to modulate the  microbiome of zebrafish larvae, elevating the abundance of Firmicutes sequences and reducing the abundance of Actinobacteria. The  microbiome changes modulated host lipid processing by inducing transcriptional down-regulation of genes involved in cholesterol and triglycerides metabolism (fit2, agpat4, dgat2, mgll, hnf4α, scap, and cck) concomitantly decreasing total body cholesterol and triglyceride content and increasing fatty  levels. L. rhamnosus treatment also increased microvilli and enterocyte lengths and decreased lipid droplet size in the intestinal . These changes resulted in elevated zebrafish larval growth. This integrated system investigation demonstrates probiotic modulation of the  microbiome, highlights a novel gene network involved in lipid metabolism, provides an insight into how the microbiome regulates molecules involved in lipid metabolism, and reveals a new potential role for L. rhamnosus in the treatment of lipid disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28442495>Aspirin prevents NF-κB activation and CDX2 expression stimulated by  and bile salts in oesophageal squamous cells of patients with Barrett's oesophagus.</a></h1><p>In previous studies using oesophageal squamous cells from patients with Barrett's oesophagus (normal oesophageal squamous (NES)-B cells) and from patients without Barrett's oesophagus (NES-G cells), we showed that  and bile salts induced caudal-related homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2) expression only in NES-B cells. CDX2, a transcription factor required to form intestinal , is a target of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signalling, which can be inhibited by aspirin. We explored mechanisms underlying differences between NES-B and NES-G cells in CDX2 expression and effects of aspirin on that CDX2 expression.We exposed NES-B and NES-G cells to  and bile salts, with and without aspirin, and evaluated effects on IκB-NF-κB-PKAc complex activation, p65 NF-κB subunit function, and CDX2 expression.In both NES-B and NES-G cells,  and bile salts activated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase to generate HO, which activated the IκB-NF-κB-PKAc complex. NES-B cells exhibited higher levels of phosphorylated IκB and p65 and greater NF-κB transcriptional activity than NES-G cells, indicating greater IκB-NF-κB-PKAc complex activation by  and bile salts in NES-B cells, and p65 siRNA prevented their increased expression of CDX2. Aspirin blocked IκB phosphorylation, p65 nuclear translocation, CDX2 promoter activation and CDX2 expression induced by  and bile salts in NES-B cells.Differences between NES-B and NES-G cells in NF-κB activation by  and bile salts can account for their differences in CDX2 expression, and their CDX2 expression can be blocked by aspirin. These findings might explain why some patients with GORD develop Barrett's oesophagus while others do not, and why aspirin might protect against development of Barrett's oesophagus.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

The highest concentration of NSPs and lignin is found in the outer cell layers of the grain, and refined flour will consequently be depleted of a large proportion of insoluble DF components. The flow and composition of carbohydrates to the large intestine are directly related to the intake of DF. The type and composition of cereal DF can consequently be used to modulate the microbial composition and activity as well as the production and molar ratios of short-chain fatty  (SCFAs). Arabinoxylans and β-glucan in whole-grain cereals and cereal ingredients have been shown to augment SCFA production, with the strongest relative effect on butyrate. When arabinoxylans were provided as a concentrate, the effect was only on total SCFA production. Increased SCFA production in the large intestine was shown by the concentration in the portal vein, whereas the impact on the concentration in peripheral blood was less because the majority of propionate and butyrate is cleared in the liver. Active microbial fermentation with increased SCFA production reduced the exposure of potentially toxic compounds to the , potentially stimulating anorectic hormones and acting as signaling molecules between the  and the peripheral tissues. The latter can have implications for insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis.© 2015 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474681>Oral Supplementation of Tocotrienol-Rich Fraction Alleviates Severity of Ulcerative Colitis in Mice.</a></h1><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by damaged colonic mucosa and submucosa layers that are caused by excessive inflammatory reactions and oxidative stress. This study aimed to examine the use of tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) in mitigating damages caused by UC on the colon . Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC mice were treated with vehicle control, TRF, alpha-tocopherol (αTP) and 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA). Observable clinical signs, quality of stool, histopathological scoring, inflammatory and oxidative markers were assessed. Vitamin E levels of colons and plasma were quantified. Oral supplementation of TRF significantly reduced the severity of DSS-induced UC by lowering the disease activity index (DAI) and histopathological inflammatory scoring. TRF also attenuated the DSS-induced enlargement of spleen and shortening of the colon. TRF has demonstrated marked anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties indicated by the attenuation of DSS-induced upregulation of inflammation and oxidative stress markers including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, myeloperoxidase (MPO), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA) and pNF-κB. These improvements were similar to that of 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) treatment. In contrast, αTP did not demonstrate evident clinical and histopathological improvements. The superior protective effect of TRF may be ascribed to the preferential absorption of TRF by the  mucosa. TRF alleviated the signs and symptoms of acute UC in murine model via the reduction of local inflammatory reactions and oxidative stress. These effects suggested that TRF could serve as a  health supplement for preventive measures for UC condition in patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30094867>The  microbiome and aquatic toxicology: An emerging concept for environmental health.</a></h1><p>The microbiome plays an essential role in the health and onset of diseases in all animals, including humans. The microbiome has emerged as a central theme in environmental toxicology because microbes interact with the host immune system in addition to its role in chemical detoxification. Pathophysiological changes in the gastrointestinal tissue caused by ingested chemicals and metabolites generated from microbial biodegradation can lead to systemic adverse effects. The present critical review dissects what we know about the impacts of environmental contaminants on the microbiome of aquatic species, with special emphasis on the  microbiome. We highlight some of the known major   proteins in vertebrate hosts that are targets for chemical perturbation, proteins that also directly cross-talk with the microbiome. These proteins may act as molecular initiators for altered  function, and we propose a general framework for an adverse outcome pathway that considers  dysbiosis as a major contributing factor to adverse apical endpoints. We present 2 case studies, nanomaterials and hydrocarbons, with special emphasis on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, to illustrate how investigations into the microbiome can improve understanding of adverse outcomes. Lastly, we present strategies to functionally relate chemical-induced  dysbiosis with adverse outcomes because this is required to demonstrate cause-effect relationships. Further investigations into the toxicant-microbiome relationship may prove to be a major breakthrough for improving animal and human health.

Although pharmacokinetics data described its absorption from the diet and its body excretion, the mechanisms involved in the uptake and transport of Si across the  wall have not been established.Caco-2 cells were used as a well-accepted in vitro model of the human intestinal  to investigate the transport, across the intestinal barrier in both the absorption and excretion directions, of Si supplied as orthosilicic  stabilized by vanillin complex (OSA-VC). The transport of this species was found proportional to the initial concentration and to the duration of incubation, with absorption and excretion mean rates similar to those of Lucifer yellow, a marker of paracellular diffusion, and increasing in the presence of EGTA, a chelator of divalents cations including calcium. A cellular accumulation of Si, polarized from the apical side of cells, was furthermore detected.These results provide evidence that Si, ingested as a food supplement containing OSA-VC, crosses the intestinal mucosa by passive diffusion via the paracellular pathway through the intercellular tight junctions and accumulates intracellularly, probably by an uptake mechanism of facilitated diffusion. This study can help to further understand the kinetic of absorption of Si.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In vitro transepithelial electric resistance (TER) and FITC-dextran diffusion were measured in different cell lines. In vivo FITC-dextran was injected in the gallbladder (GB) lumen and traced in plasma. Tight junction proteins and TGR5-induced signalling were investigated in vitro and in vivo (wild-type [WT] and TGR5-KO livers and GB). WT and TGR5-KO mice were submitted to bile duct ligation or alpha-naphtylisothiocyanate intoxication under vehicle or TGR5 agonist treatment, and liver injury was studied.In vitro TGR5 stimulation increased TER and reduced paracellular permeability for dextran. In vivo dextran diffusion after GB injection was increased in TGR5-knock-out (KO) as compared with WT mice and decreased on TGR5 stimulation. In TGR5-KO bile ducts and GB, junctional adhesion molecule A (JAM-A) was hypophosphorylated and selectively downregulated among TJP analysed. TGR5 stimulation induced JAM-A phosphorylation and stabilisation both in vitro and in vivo, associated with protein kinase C-ζ activation. TGR5 agonist-induced TER increase as well as JAM-A protein stabilisation was dependent on JAM-A Ser285 phosphorylation. TGR5 agonist-treated mice were protected from cholestasis-induced liver injury, and this protection was significantly impaired in JAM-A-KO mice.The BA receptor TGR5 regulates biliary epithelial barrier function in vitro and in vivo through an impact on JAM-A expression and phosphorylation, thereby protecting liver parenchyma against bile leakage.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

However, the effects of specific health-related phytochemicals within a complex food matrix are difficult to assess. In an attempt to address this problem, we have used elicitation to improve the nutraceutical content of seedlings of Brassica oleracea grown under controlled conditions. Analysis, by LC-MS, of the glucosinolate, isothiocyanate and phenolic compound content of juices obtained from sprouts indicated that elicitation induces an enrichment of several phenolics, particularly of the anthocyanin fraction. To test the biological activity of basal and enriched juices we took advantage of a recently developed in vitro model of inflamed human intestinal . Both sprouts' juices protected intestinal barrier integrity in Caco-2 cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor α under marginal zinc deprivation, with the enriched juice showing higher protection. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that the extent of rescue from stress-induced epithelial dysfunction correlated with the composition in bioactive molecules of the juices and, in particular, with a group of phenolic compounds, including several anthocyanins, quercetin-3-Glc, cryptochlorogenic, neochlorogenic and cinnamic .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27459152>Intestinal cell damage and systemic immune activation in individuals reporting sensitivity to wheat in the absence of coeliac disease.</a></h1><p>Wheat gluten and related proteins can trigger an autoimmune enteropathy, known as coeliac disease, in people with genetic susceptibility. However, some individuals experience a range of symptoms in response to wheat ingestion, without the characteristic serological or histological evidence of coeliac disease. The aetiology and mechanism of these symptoms are unknown, and no biomarkers have been identified. We aimed to determine if sensitivity to wheat in the absence of coeliac disease is associated with systemic immune activation that may be linked to an enteropathy.Study participants included individuals who reported symptoms in response to wheat intake and in whom coeliac disease and wheat allergy were ruled out, patients with coeliac disease and healthy controls. Sera were analysed for markers of intestinal cell damage and systemic immune response to microbial components.Individuals with wheat sensitivity had significantly increased serum levels of soluble CD14 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein, as well as antibody reactivity to bacterial LPS and flagellin. Circulating levels of fatty -binding protein 2 (FABP2), a marker of intestinal epithelial cell damage, were significantly elevated in the affected individuals and correlated with the immune responses to microbial products. There was a significant change towards normalisation of the levels of FABP2 and immune activation markers in a subgroup of individuals with wheat sensitivity who observed a diet excluding wheat and related cereals.These findings reveal a state of systemic immune activation in conjunction with a compromised intestinal  affecting a subset of individuals who experience sensitivity to wheat in the absence of coeliac disease.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

In the case of Barrett's oesophagus, intestinal metaplasia occurs at the gastro-oesophageal junction, where stratified squamous  transitions into simple columnar cells. On the basis of a number of experimental models, several alternative cell types have been proposed as the source of this metaplasia but in all cases the evidence is inconclusive: no model completely mimics Barrett's oesophagus in terms of the presence of intestinal goblet cells. Here we describe a transitional columnar  with distinct basal progenitor cells (p63KRT5KRT7) at the squamous-columnar junction of the upper gastrointestinal tract in a mouse model. We use multiple models and lineage tracing strategies to show that this squamous-columnar junction basal cell population serves as a source of progenitors for the transitional . On ectopic expression of CDX2, these transitional basal progenitors differentiate into intestinal-like  (including goblet cells) and thereby reproduce Barrett's metaplasia. A similar transitional columnar  is present at the transitional zones of other mouse tissues (including the anorectal junction) as well as in the gastro-oesophageal junction in the human .  reflux-induced oesophagitis and the multilayered  (believed to be a precursor of Barrett's oesophagus) are both characterized by the expansion of the transitional basal progenitor cells. Our findings reveal a previously unidentified transitional zone in the  of the upper gastrointestinal tract and provide evidence that the p63KRT5KRT7 basal cells in this zone are the cells of origin for multi-layered  and Barrett's oesophagus.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25838985>Roles and regulation of the mucus barrier in the .</a></h1><p>The gastrointestinal tract is coated by a thick layer of mucus that forms the front line of innate host defense. Mucus consists of high molecular weight glycoproteins called mucins that are synthesized and secreted by goblet cells and functions primarily to lubricate the  and protect it from damage by noxious substances. Recent studies have also suggested the involvement of goblet cells and mucins in complex immune functions such as antigen presentation and tolerance. Under normal physiological conditions, goblet cells continually produce mucins to replenish and maintain the mucus barrier; however, goblet cell function can be disrupted by various factors that can affect the integrity of the mucus barrier. Some of these factors such as microbes, microbial toxins and cytokines can stimulate or inhibit mucin production and secretion, alter the chemical composition of mucins or degrade the mucus layer. This can lead to a compromised mucus barrier and subsequently to various pathological conditions like chronic inflammatory diseases.

Nur77 is crucial in regulating the T helper 1/regulatory T-cell balance, is expressed in macrophages and drives M2 macrophage polarization. In this study we aimed to define the function of Nur77 in inflammatory bowel disease. In wild-type and Nur77-/- mice, colitis development was studied in dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)- and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced models. To understand the underlying mechanism, Nur77 was overexpressed in macrophages and  epithelial cells. Nur77 protein is expressed in colon tissues from Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis patients and colons from colitic mice in inflammatory cells and . In both mouse colitis models inflammation was increased in Nur77-/- mice. A higher neutrophil influx and enhanced IL-6, MCP-1 and KC production was observed in Nur77-deficient colons after DSS-treatment. TNBS-induced influx of T-cells and inflammatory monocytes into the colon was higher in Nur77-/- mice, along with increased expression of MCP-1, TNFα and IL-6, and decreased Foxp3 RNA expression, compared to wild-type mice. Overexpression of Nur77 in lipopolysaccharide activated RAW macrophages resulted in up-regulated IL-10 and downregulated TNFα, MIF-1 and MCP-1 mRNA expression through NFκB repression. Nur77 also strongly decreased expression of MCP-1, CXCL1, IL-8, MIP-1α and TNFα in  epithelial Caco-2 cells. Nur77 overexpression suppresses the inflammatory status of both macrophages and  epithelial cells and together with the in vivo mouse data this supports that Nur77 has a protective function in experimental colitis. These findings may have implications for development of novel targeted treatment strategies regarding inflammatory bowel disease and other inflammatory diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29967615>The Microenvironment in Barrett's Esophagus Tissue Is Characterized by High  and  Levels.</a></h1><p>Metaplasia in Barrett's esophagus (BE) is characterized by the transition of squamous  into intestinal-type columnar . The immune response in BE shares many similarities with the response found in the , which is different from the response found in a normal-looking esophagus. Here, we investigated the role of the genes associated with the retinoic  (RA) pathway in BE, as RA is important not only in shaping the 's immune response but also in the induction of metaplasia . mRNA was isolated from esophageal and duodenal biopsies from BE ( = 14), reflux esophagitis patients ( = 9), and controls ( = 12). cDNA was made and qPCR was performed. The expression of RALDH1, CYP26A1, MAdCAM1 were similar for both the BE and duodenum, but different when compared to squamous esophageal . BE was characterized by a higher expression of RALDH2 and FOXP3, compared to the duodenum. In BE, RALDH2 correlated with expression of the myeloid dendritic cell-specific genes: CD11c and CD1c. Also, RALDH2 expression correlated with RAR-β and FOXP3. Hierarchical clustering on the expression of multiple relevant genes demonstrated that BE, duodenum, and SQ tissues are clustered as three different groups. The differential expression of RA-specific genes and dendritic cell (DC)-subsets indicates that BE resembles duodenal tissue. The higher expression of RALDH2 and FOXP3 in BE points at a mechanism associated with a possible anti-inflammatory microenvironment. This aberrant immune regulation might contribute to the altered tissue and immune responses found in BE.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27345325>Adrenomedullin regulates intestinal physiology and pathophysiology.</a></h1><p>Adrenomedullin (AM) and proadrenomedullin N-terminal 20 peptide (PAMP) are 2 biologically active peptides produced by the same gene, ADM, with ubiquitous distribution and many physiological functions. Adrenomedullin is composed of 52 amino , has an internal molecular ring composed by 6 amino  and a disulfide bond, and shares structural similarities with calcitonin gene-related peptide, amylin, and intermedin. The AM receptor consists of a 7-transmembrane domain protein called calcitonin receptor-like receptor in combination with a single transmembrane domain protein known as receptor activity-modifying protein. Using morphologic techniques, it has been shown that AM and PAMP are expressed throughout the gastrointestinal tract, being specially abundant in the neuroendocrine cells of the gastrointestinal mucosa; in the enterochromaffin-like and chief cells of the gastric fundus; and in the submucosa of the duodenum, ileum, and colon. This wide distribution in the gastrointestinal tract suggests that AM and PAMP may act as  hormones regulating many physiological and pathologic conditions. To date, it has been proven that AM and PAMP act as autocrine/paracrine growth factors in the gastrointestinal , play key roles in the protection of gastric mucosa from various kinds of injury, and accelerate healing in diseases such as gastric ulcer and inflammatory bowel diseases. In addition, both peptides are potent inhibitors of gastric  secretion and gastric emptying; they regulate the active transport of sugars in the intestine, regulate water and ion transport in the colon, modulate colonic bowel movements and small-intestine motility, improve endothelial barrier function, and stabilize circulatory function during gastrointestinal inflammation. Furthermore, AM and PAMP are antimicrobial peptides, and they contribute to the mucosal host defense system by regulating  microbiota. To get a formal demonstration of the effects that endogenous AM and PAMP may have in  microbiota, we developed an inducible knockout of the ADM gene. Using this model, we have shown, for the first time, that lack of AM/PAMP leads to changes in  microbiota composition in mice. Further studies are needed to investigate whether this lack of AM/PAMP may have an impact in the development and/or progression of intestinal diseases through their effect on microbiota composition.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Various species of Leishmania are the agents of the disease, which take different clinical manifestations. The parasite is transmitted by sandflies, predominantly from the Phlebotomus genus in the Old World and Lutzomyia in the New World. During development in the , Leishmania must survive various challenges, which include avoiding being expelled with blood remnants after digestion. It is believed that attachment to the   is a necessary step for vector infection, and molecules from parasites and sand flies have been implicated in this attachment. In previous work, monoclonal antibodies were produced against Leishmania. Among these an antibody was obtained against Leishmania braziliensis flagella, which blocked the attachment of Leishmania panamensis flagella to Phlebotomus papatasi guts. The protein recognized by this antibody was identified and named FLAG1, and the complete FLAG1 gene sequence was obtained. This protein was later independently identified as a small, myristoylated protein and called SMP1, so from now on it will be denominated FLAG1/SMP1. The FLAG1/SMP1 gene is expressed in all developmental stages of the parasite, but has higher expression in promastigotes. The anti-FLAG1/SMP1 antibody recognized the flagellum of all Leishmania species tested and generated the expected band by western blots. This antibody was used in attachment and infection blocking experiments. Using the New World vector Lutzomyia longipalpis and Leishmania infantum chagasi, no inhibition of attachment ex vivo or infection in vivo was seen. On the other hand, when the Old World vectors P. papatasi and Leishmania major were used, a significant decrease of both attachment and infection were seen in the presence of the antibody. We propose that FLAG1/SMP1 is involved in the attachment/infection of Leishmania in the strict vector P. papatasi and not the permissive vector L. longipalpis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28984048>Antibiotic pretreatment minimizes dietary effects on reconstructure of rumen fluid and mucosal microbiota in goats.</a></h1><p>We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to examine the posteffects of antibiotic treatment on the structure and metabolism of rumen microbiota. Twelve goats were randomly assigned into two groups, with one group receiving intramuscular streptomycin injection at 40 mg/kg bodyweight daily for 10 days. At 4 weeks after treatment with antibiotic, three goats were randomly selected from each group and switched to a 35% concentrate diet. The remaining six goats continued with the 10% concentrate diet. At 4 weeks after dietary shift, ruminal fluid and  were collected to analyze the microbiota composition and short-chain fatty  (SCFA) concentrations of the rumen. We found that antibiotic administration led to increases in the diversity and richness of recovered mucosal microbiota and to decreases in those of recovered fluid microbiota. When dietary modulation was performed after antibiotic intake, both communities showed little difference in structure from premodulated states. Additionally, antibiotic pretreatment reduced the basal lines of individual SCFAs but did not affect the increased percentages of SCFAs. Overall, our results indicate that antibiotic administration affects the structure of both rumen fluid and mucosal microbiota and reduces the functional redundancy of rumen microbiota.© 2017 The Authors.

However, information on anti-inflammatory role of GPR120 at the level of intestinal  is very limited. Current studies demonstrated differential levels of GPR120 mRNA and protein along the length of the human, mouse, and rat intestine and delineated distinct anti-inflammatory responses following GPR120 activation in model human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells, but not in model mouse intestinal epithelial endocrine cell line STC-1. In Caco-2 cells, GPR120 was internalized, bound to β-arrestin-2, and attenuated NF-κB activation in response to 30-min exposure to the agonists GW9508, TUG-891, or docosahexaenoic . These effects were abrogated in response to small interfering RNA silencing of β-arrestin-2. Treatment of STC-1 cells with these agonists did not induce receptor internalization and had no effects on NF-κB activation, although treatment with the agonists GW9508 or TUG-891 for 6 h augmented the synthesis and secretion of the  hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 in this cell line.

For the present study the effect of Eimeria on expression of components of amino  and sugar uptake mechanisms was determined. Broiler chicks were infected with Eimeria maxima, which infects the jejunum; Eimeria acervulina, which infects the duodenum; or Eimeria tenella, which infects the ceca. Sections of the jejunum, duodenum, and ceca (depending on species of Eimeria) were taken at several time points between d zero and 14 post infection (PI) for mRNA expression analysis. Genes examined included one digestive enzyme, 7 peptide and amino  transporters located on the brush border, 8 transporters located at the basolateral surface of the  , and 5 sugar transporters. All 3 Eimeria species examined caused decrease in expression of brush border transporters particularly at d 5 to 7 PI, which corresponds to the time when pathology is greatest. The same pattern was seen in expression of sugar transporters. However, the expression of basolateral transporters differed among species. Eimeria tenella infection resulted in decreased expression of all basolateral transporters, while E. maxima infection caused increased expression of 2 genes and slight decrease in expression of the remaining 5 genes. Infection with E. acervulina resulted in increased expression at the height of infection of all but one basolateral transporter. In conclusion, Eimeria infection causes a general decrease in gene expression of sugar transporter and brush border AATs at the height of infection. However the expression of basolateral transporters is increased in E. maxima and E. acervulina infected birds. It is possible that decreased expression of brush border transporters in combination with increased expression of basolateral transporters leads to decrease of nutrients available for the parasite, thus limiting parasite reproduction.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Poultry Science Association 2016.

This study aimed to determine regional distribution and frequency of endocrine cells secretory of serotonin (5-HT), somatostatin (SST) and gastrin (GAS) in the GIT of a small-bodied widespread characin Astyanax bimaculatus using histological, histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques. Fragments of the stomach and  fixed for 8h in Bouin liquid were subjected to histological processing and immunohistochemical routine. For the histological analyses, the technique of staining with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) was used, whereas for the histochemical analyses Gomori's trichrome, periodic +Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue pH 2.5 (AB) were used to further immunohistochemical processing. The stomach has a mucosa lined with a simple columnar  with mucus-secreting cells; the glandular region (proximal and distal portions) has folds and pits, whereas the non-glandular region has pits only. The intestinal  is simple with plain cylindrical grooved and goblet cells. The anterior region has thin folds with few goblet cells, and the posterior region with thick folds and many goblet cells. The regional distribution and frequency of endocrine cells varied across regions of the GIT with the stomach showing the highest amount of immunoreactive (IR) cells. Only the 5-HT was found in the stomach (epithelia and glands) and  regions, with comparatively higher frequency in the stomach. SST-IR cells were found in the stomach (epithelia and gastric glands) with higher frequency in the glandular region, whereas GAS-IR were found in the gastric glands only. The stomach was the only organ to have all the three types of endocrine cells, indicating that this organ is the main site of digestion of food in this species.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

A dysregulated ionic movement across the  can result in GI diseases that manifest as either watery diarrhea or constipation. Hirschsprung disease is an example of an ENS disorder characterized by absence of enteric ganglia in distal  resulting in obstructive phenotype. Receptor rearranged during transfection (RET) gene variants are the most commonly recognized genetic associations with Hirschsprung disease. In this issue of Neurogastroenterology and Motility, Russell et al demonstrate that RET mediates colonic ion transport through modulation of cholinergic nerves.

In addition to the intrinsic regulation of secretory processes, luminal mediators like bile , short-chain fatty , and proteases can affect both secretion and barrier function of the intestinal . Elevated levels of proteases have been identified in a wide range of GI diseases including irritable bowel syndrome. Proteases are known to cause visceral hypersensitivity and barrier disruption in vitro and in animal models. The goals of this review are to describe fundamental concepts related to intestinal epithelial secretion, the utility of Ussing chambers to measure ionic mechanisms and to discuss examples of novel signaling pathways; namely the RET signaling cascade in secretomotor neurons and effects of luminal proteases on barrier and ionic secretion.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31289141>A Cross-Sectional Study of Compositional and Functional Profiles of  Microbiota in Sardinian Centenarians.</a></h1><p>Sardinia, Italy, has a high prevalence of residents who live more than 100 years.

The  microbiota has been proposed as a promising determinant for human health. Centenarians as a model for extreme aging may help us understand the correlation of  microbiota with healthy aging and longevity. Here we confirmed that centenarians had microbiota elements usually associated with benefits to health. Our finding of a high capacity of glycolysis and related SCFA production represented a healthy microbiome and environment that is regarded as beneficial for host  . The low abundance of genes encoding components of pathways involved in carbohydrate degradation was also found in the  microbiota of Sardinian centenarians and is often associated with poor  health. Overall, our study here represents an expansion of previous research investigating the age-related changes in  microbiota. Furthermore, our study provides a new prospective for potential targets for  microbiota intervention directed at limiting  inflammation and pathology and enhancing a healthy  barrier.Copyright © 2019 Wu et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31427744>Hyaluronic -bilirubin nanomedicine for targeted modulation of dysregulated intestinal barrier, microbiome and immune responses in colitis.</a></h1><p>While conventional approaches for inflammatory bowel diseases mainly focus on suppressing hyperactive immune responses, it remains unclear how to address disrupted intestinal barriers, dysbiosis of the  commensal microbiota and dysregulated mucosal immune responses in inflammatory bowel diseases. Moreover, immunosuppressive agents can cause off-target systemic side effects and complications. Here, we report the development of hyaluronic -bilirubin nanomedicine (HABN) that accumulates in inflamed colonic  and restores the  barriers in a murine model of acute colitis. Surprisingly, HABN also modulates the  microbiota, increasing the overall richness and diversity and markedly augmenting the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and Clostridium XIVα, which are microorganisms with crucial roles in  homeostasis. Importantly, HABN associated with pro-inflammatory macrophages, regulated innate immune responses and exerted potent therapeutic efficacy against colitis.

Probiotics exert beneficial health effects, mainly by reinforcing the intestinal  and modulating the  microbiota. However, the mechanisms of action, and especially, the specific regulatory effects of modulated microbiota by probiotics on the intestinal  have not yet been elucidated. The present study aimed to decipher the protective effects of the probiotic  strain ZLP001 on the intestinal  and microbiota as well as the effects of modulated microbiota on epithelial function. Paracellular permeability was measured with fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FD-4). Gene and protein expression levels of tight junction (TJ) proteins, proinflammatory cytokines, and host defense peptides were determined by RT-qPCR, ELISA, and western blot analysis. Short-chain fatty  (SCFA) concentrations were measured by ion chromatography. Fecal microbiota composition was assessed by high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that pretreatment with 10 colony forming units (CFU) mL of  ZLP001 significantly counteracted the increase in  permeability to FD-4 induced by 10 CFU mL enterotoxigenic  (ETEC). In addition,  ZLP001 pretreatment alleviated the reduction in TJ proteins (claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1) and downregulated proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, and TNFα expression and secretion caused by ETEC.  ZLP001 also significantly increased the expression of the host defense peptides  and  and pBD2 secretion relative to the control. Furthermore,  ZLP001 treatment affected piglet fecal microbiota. The abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria  and  was significantly increased in  ZLP001-treated piglets, and showed a positive correlation with fecal butyric and acetic  concentrations. In addition, the cell density of  1, which may cause epithelial inflammation, was decreased after  ZLP001 administration, while the beneficial  was significantly increased. Our findings suggest that  ZLP001 fortifies the intestinal barrier by strengthening epithelial defense functions and modulating  microbiota.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30289852>Remote Intestinal Injury Early After Experimental Polytrauma and Hemorrhagic Shock.</a></h1><p>Dysfunction of the -blood barrier plays an important role in many diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, hemorrhagic shock (HS), or burn injury. However, little is known about  barrier dysfunction after hemodynamically instable polytrauma (PT). Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effects of PT and HS on remote intestinal damage and barrier dysfunction, especially regarding the role of zonula occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) as an important tight junction protein.Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to either PT (thorax trauma, closed head injury, soft tissue injury, and distal femoral fracture), 60 min of pressure-controlled HS (30 ± 5 mmHg), or PT+HS, or sham procedures.Animals of all trauma groups showed an increase in abdominal girth and dilation of the intestine during the experimental period, which was largest in the PT+HS group. Increased blood-tissue permeability to albumin (assessed by Evans blue dye) was found in the HS group. Experimental groups showed a slight increase in plasma concentration of intestinal fatty  binding protein and some intestinal damage was histologically detectable. Of note, PT+HS animals revealed significantly reduced expression of ZO-1 in intestinal epithelial cells. In an in-vitro model, stimulation of human colon epithelial cells with peptidoglycan, but not with lipopolysaccharide, resulted in elevated secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reflecting inflammatory activity of the intestinal .Taken together, PT and HS lead to increased permeability of the -blood barrier.

The hypothesis tested is whether dietary supplementation with currants attenuates atherosclerosis and affects plasma phenolics during prolonged hypercholesterolemia in rabbits. Thirty New Zealand White rabbits were fed one of four diets (normal and supplemented with 10% currants, with 0.5% cholesterol, and with 0.5% cholesterol plus 10% currants) for eight weeks. Plasma lipids, glucose and hepatic enzymes were determined. Individual phenolic compounds were identified and quantified in plasma during the dietary intervention. At the end of the study, histological examinations of aorta and liver were performed. The high-cholesterol diet resulted in hypercholesterolemia and oxidative stress, increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity and induced aortic and hepatic lesion formation. Corinthian currant supplementation attenuated atherosclerotic lesions, maintained AST within the normal range and reduced oxidative stress without affecting glucose concentrations. The p-OH-benzoic and p-OH-phenylacetic  predominated at high concentrations in plasma and remained almost constant during the study in the group that received the normal rabbit chow and the groups given food with added cholesterol either alone or supplemented with currants. Currant supplementation to the normal diet resulted in the reduced absorption of phenolic compounds, as revealed by the measurement of their plasma metabolites, suggesting a regulatory mechanism at the  level under normal conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28978412>Layilin is critical for mediating hyaluronan 35kDa-induced intestinal epithelial tight junction protein ZO-1 in vitro and in vivo.</a></h1><p>Tight junction proteins are critical in maintaining homeostatic intestinal permeability. Multiple intestinal inflammatory diseases are correlated with reduced expression of tight junction proteins. We have recently reported that oral treatment of mice with Hyaluronan 35kDa (HA35) increases colonic expression of tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Here, we investigate whether HA35 treatment enhances ZO-1 expression by direct interaction with intestinal  in vitro and have identified the HA receptor responsible for HA35-mediated ZO-1 induction in colonic  in vitro and in vivo. Our results reveal that HA35 treatment increases ZO-1 expression in mouse intestinal epithelial organoids, while large HA 2000kDa is not internalized into the cells. Our immunofluorescence data indicate that layilin, but neither toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) nor CD44, mediate the HA35-induced ZO-1 expression in colonic  in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, using layilin null mice we have determined that layilin mediates HA35 induction of ZO-1 in healthy mice and during dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Furthermore, we find that while ZO-1 expression levels are reduced, layilin expression levels are equivalent in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and non-IBD controls. Together, our data suggest that layilin is an important HA receptor, that mediates the effect of oral HA35 treatment on intestinal .

The hormone hepcidin may regulate retinal Fpn, as it triggers Fpn degradation in the . Immunofluorescence was used to label Fpn in retinas of mice with 4 different genotypes (wild type; Fpn C326S, a hepcidin-resistant Fpn; hepcidin knockout; and ceruloplasmin/hephaestin double knockout). No significant difference in Fpn levels was observed in these retinas. Fpn localized to the abluminal side of the outer plexiform vascular endothelial cells, Müller glia cells, and the basolateral side of the retinal pigment . Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-hepcidin was injected into the eyes of hepcidin knockout mice, while AAV-lacZ was injected into the contralateral eyes as a control. AAV-hepcidin injected eyes had increased ferritin immunolabeling in retinal vascular endothelial cells. Fpn C326S mice had systemic iron overload compared to wild type and had the fastest retinal iron accumulation of any hereditary model studied to date. The results suggest that physiologic hepcidin levels are insufficient to alter Fpn levels within the retinal pigment  and Müller cells, but may limit iron transport into the retina from vascular endothelial cells.© FASEB.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31260507>Schlafen 3 knockout mice display gender-specific differences in weight gain, food efficiency, and expression of markers of intestinal epithelial differentiation, metabolism, and immune cell function.</a></h1><p>Self-renewal and differentiation are essential for intestinal  absorptive functioning and adaptation to pathological states such as short  syndrome, ulcers, and inflammatory bowel disease. The rodent Slfn3 and its human analog Slfn12 are critical in regulating intestinal epithelial differentiation. We sought to characterize intestinal function in Slfn3 knockout (KO) mice. Male and female pair-fed Slfn3KO mice gained less weight with decreased food efficiency than wild type (WT) mice, with more pronounced effects in females. RNA sequencing performed on intestinal mucosa of Slfn3KO and WT mice showed gene ontology decreases in cell adhesion molecule signaling, tumor necrosis factor receptor binding, and adaptive immune cell proliferation/functioning genes in Slfn3KO mice, with greater effects in females. qPCR analysis of fatty  metabolism genes, Pla2g4c, Pla2g2f, and Cyp3c55 revealed an increase in Pla2g4c, and a decrease in Pla2g2f in Slfn3KO females. Additionally, adipogenesis genes, Fabp4 and Lpl were decreased and ketogenesis gene Hmgcs2 was increased in female Slfn3KO mice. Sequencing did not reveal significant changes in differentiation markers, so qPCR was utilized. Slfn3KO tended to have decreased expression of intestinal differentiation markers sucrase isomaltase, dipeptidyl peptidase 4, villin 1, and glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) vs. WT males, although these trends did not achieve statistical significance unless data from several markers was pooled. Differentiation markers, Glut2 and sodium-glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1), did show statistically significant sex-dependent differences. Glut2 mRNA was reduced in Slfn3KO females, while SGLT1 increased in Slfn3KO males. Notch2 and Cdx2 were only increased in female Slfn3KO mice. Although Slfn3KO mice gain less weight and decreased food efficiency, their biochemical phenotype is more subtle and suggests a complex interplay between gender effects, Slfn3, and another regulatory pathway yet to be identified that compensates for the chronic loss of Slfn3.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28271031>Enteroendocrine-derived glucagon-like peptide-2 controls intestinal amino  transport.</a></h1><p>Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is co-secreted with GLP-1 from  endocrine cells, and both peptides act as growth factors to expand the surface area of the mucosal . Notably, GLP-2 also enhances glucose and lipid transport in enterocytes; however, its actions on control of amino  (AA) transport remain unclear. Here we examined the mechanisms linking gain and loss of GLP-2 receptor (GLP-2R) signaling to control of intestinal amino  absorption in mice.Absorption, transport, and clearance of essential AAs, specifically lysine, were measured  by Liquid Chromatography triple quadrupole Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and  with Ussing chambers using intestinal preparations from r and  mice. Immunoblotting determined jejunal levels of protein components of signaling pathways (PI3K-AKT, and mTORC1-pS6-p4E-BP1) following administration of GLP-2, protein gavage, and rapamycin to fasted r and  mice. Expression of AA transporters from full thickness jejunum and 4F2hc from brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) was measured by real-time PCR and immunoblotting, respectively.Acute administration of GLP-2 increased basal AA absorption  and augmented basal lysine transport . GLP-2-stimulated lysine transport was attenuated by co-incubation with wortmannin, rapamycin, or tetrodotoxin . Phosphorylation of mTORC1 effector proteins S6 and 4E-BP1 was significantly increased in wild-type mice in response to GLP-2 alone, or when co-administered with protein gavage, and abolished following oral gavage of rapamycin. In contrast, activation of GLP-1R signaling did not enhance S6 phosphorylation. Disruption of GLP-2 action in  mice reduced lysine transport  and attenuated the phosphorylation of S6 and 4E-BP1 in response to oral protein. Moreover, the expression of cationic AA transporter  in response to refeeding, and the abundance of 4F2hc in BBMVs following protein gavage, was significantly attenuated in  mice.These findings reveal an important role for GLP-2R signaling in the physiological and pharmacological control of enteral amino  sensing and assimilation, defining an enteroendocrine cell-enterocyte axis for optimal energy absorption.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27840292>Chronic exposure to short-chain fatty  modulates transport and metabolism of microbiome-derived phenolics in human intestinal cells.</a></h1><p>Dietary fiber-derived short-chain fatty  (SCFA) and phenolics produced by the  microbiome have multiple effects on health. We have tested the hypothesis that long-term exposure to physiological concentrations of SCFA can affect the transport and metabolism of (poly)phenols by the intestinal  using the Caco-2 cell model. Metabolites and conjugates of hesperetin (HT) and ferulic  (FA), -derived from dietary hesperidin and chlorogenic , respectively, were quantified by LC-MS with authentic standards following transport across differentiated cell monolayers. Changes in metabolite levels were correlated with effects on mRNA and protein expression of key enzymes and transporters. Propionate and butyrate increased both FA transport and rate of appearance of FA glucuronide apically and basolaterally, linked to an induction of MCT1. Propionate was the only SCFA that augmented the rate of formation of basolateral FA sulfate conjugates, possibly via basolateral transporter up-regulation. In addition, propionate enhanced the formation of HT glucuronide conjugates and increased HT sulfate efflux toward the basolateral compartment. Acetate treatment amplified transepithelial transport of FA in the apical to basolateral direction, associated with lower levels of MCT1 protein expression. Metabolism and transport of both HT and FA were curtailed by the organic  lactate owing to a reduction of UGT1A1 protein levels. Our data indicate a direct interaction between microbiota-derived metabolites of (poly)phenols and SCFA through modulation of transporters and conjugating enzymes and increase our understanding of how dietary fiber, via the microbiome, may affect and enhance uptake of bioactive molecules.Copyright Â© 2016 The Authors.

However, the pathogenic mechanism of D-GPV remains undefined. Here, we first reported the  microbiome diversity of D-GPV infected Cherry Valley ducks. In the investigation for the influence of D-GPV infection on  microbiota through a period of infection, we found that D-GPV infection caused  microbiota dysbiosis by reducing the prevalence of the dominant genera and decreasing microbial diversity. Furthermore, exfoliation of the intestinal , proliferation of lymphocytes, up-regulated mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, and IL-22 and down-regulated mRNA expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and IL-4 occurred when D-GPV targeted in cecal . In addition, the content of short chain fatty  (SCFAs) in cecal contents was significantly reduced after D-GPV infection. Importantly, the disorder of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines was associated with the decrease of SCFAs-producing bacteria and the enrichment of opportunistic pathogens. Collectively, the decrease of SCFAs and the enrichment of pathogen-containing  communities promoted intestinal inflammatory injury.

Hydrogen sulfide (HS) has emerged as an important mediator of many physiological functions, including gastrointestinal mucosal defense and repair. Hydrogen sulfide is produced by gastrointestinal tract tissues and by bacteria residing within the  and can influence the function of a wide range of cells. The microbiota also appears to be an important target of hydrogen sulfide. HS donors can modify the  microbiota, and the gastrointestinal  is a major site of oxidation of microbial-derived HS. When administered together with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, HS can prevent some of the dysbiosis those drugs induce, possibly contributing to the observed prevention of gastrointestinal damage. Exogenous HS can also markedly reduce the severity of experimental colitis and plays important roles in modulating epithelial cell-mucus-bacterial interactions in the intestine, contributing to its ability to promote resolution of inflammation and repair of tissue injury. In this paper we review recent studies examining the roles of HS in mucosal defense, the possibility that HS can damage the gastrointestinal , and effects of HS on the  microbiota and on mucus and biofilm interactions in the context of intestinal inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27210061>Effect of the supplementation with a blend containing short and medium chain fatty  monoglycerides in milk replacer on rumen papillae development in weaning calves.</a></h1><p>Feeding of neonates with artificial milk formulas is a popular trend toward early weaning of newborn dairy calves. These milk replacers (MR) should accelerate the rumen development, determining early solid feed intake and leading to better performances in cattle. Previous research demonstrated that sodium butyrate supplementation in MR can affect both small intestine and rumen development. Also acetate and propionate showed similar properties, while only a few studies indicate some potential benefit of monoglycerides on  functions. The present study is aimed to determine the effect of the supplementation of a blend containing short and medium chain fatty  monoglycerides (SMCFA) in milk replacer on rumen papillae development and growth performances in weaning calves. Twenty bull calves (about 2 weeks old, weighing around 43kg) were randomly allocated into two groups: control (C) and treated (T). Besides MR and starter diet, the latter offered at libitum, T calves received 0.2% SMCFA in MR. Animals were slaughtered after 56 days from the beginning of the trial. No difference was found between groups either in growth performances or in mean number of papillae/cm(2) of mucosa, total surface of papillae (mm(2))/cm(2) of mucosa or papillary size. In both groups, the morphology of the rumen  was typical of parakeratosis. The cells of the stratum spinosum were directly transformed into swollen, ovoid, still nucleated keratinocytes, particularly at the papillary tip, probably as a result of unphysiological osmolarities caused by high concentrate intake. Degenerated squamous horn cells covered the "balloon like" cells forming several layers, particularly in the places of the rumen mucosa more protected from an abrasive action of solid feed. This was more evident in C animals. The squamous cells covering the papillary tip showed cytoplasmic protrusion, representing remains of the attachment sites of desmosomes, which increased the total absorptive surface and were more numerous and higher in T compared to C animals. It might be hypothesized that SMCFA supplementation in MR could better regulate epithelial cell proliferation and probably have an "emollient effect" leading to an easier "peeling" that might increase efficiency for nutrient transport across the .Copyright © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

The study aimed at determining the effect of non-essential amino  (NEAA) and threonine (Thr) levels on GC number and mucus layer thickness measured in different parts of the . A two-factorial experiment was conducted on 72 pigs (initial BW 12.5 kg) using as factors: Thr level (5.1, 5.7, 6.3 and 6.9 g standardized ileal digestible [SID] Thr/kg) and wheat gluten (WG) level used as a source of NEAA (20.4, 40.4 and 60.4 g WG protein in WG20, WG40 and WG60 diets respectively). All diets covered the requirement for essential AA, except for Thr, and they were fed to six pigs for 20 days. Thr level affected only the count of GC containing acidic mucins in the proximal colon, which was higher in pigs fed a diet with 5.1 g SID Thr/kg in comparison with diet containing 6.3 g SID Thr/kg. In the villi, WG40 and/or WG60 increased the GC number containing acidic mucins and lowered that with neutral mucins in the middle jejunum. In the crypts, higher WG levels decreased the GC number with acidic mucins in the duodenum, ileum and proximal colon and increased that with neutral and mixed mucins in the duodenum and ileum. The mucus layer was thicker in the proximal and middle jejunum in WG20 pigs, whereas in the proximal colon it was thicker in WG60 pigs. The lowest GC count was found in the middle jejunum and the highest in the duodenum and proximal colon. The mucus layer was the thinnest in the proximal and middle jejunum and the thickest in the ileum.

There is increasing evidence supporting the beneficial impact of dietary PACs in the prevention and nutritional management of non-communicable chronic diseases. It is considered that PACs with a degree of polymerization >3 remain unabsorbed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and accumulate in the colonic lumen. Accordingly, the GI tract may be considered as a key organ for the healthy-promoting effects of dietary PACs. PACs form non-specific complexes with salivary proteins in mouth, originating the sensation of astringency, and with dietary proteins, pancreatic enzymes, and nutrient transporters in the intestinal lumen, decreasing the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. They also exert antimicrobial activities, interfering with cariogenic or ulcerogenic pathogens in the mouth () and stomach (), respectively. Through their antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties, PACs decrease inflammatory processes in animal model of gastric and colonic inflammation. Interestingly, they exert prebiotic activities, stimulating the growth of  spp. and  spp. as well as some butyrate-producing bacteria in the colon. Finally, PACs are also metabolized by the  microbiota, producing metabolites, mainly aromatic  and valerolactones, which accumulate in the colon and/or are absorbed into the bloodstream. Accordingly, these compounds could display biological activities on the colonic  or in extra-intestinal tissues and, therefore, contribute to part of the beneficial effects of dietary PACs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29124968>Probiotic bacteria cell walls stimulate the activity of the intestinal epithelial cells and macrophage functionality.</a></h1><p>The effect of oral administration of probiotic bacteria cell walls (PBCWs) in the stimulation of the immune system in healthy BALB/c mice was evaluated. We focused our investigation mainly on intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) which are essential for coordinating an adequate mucosal immune response and on the functionality of macrophages. The probiotic bacteria and their cell walls were able to stimulate the IECs exhibiting an important activation and cytokine releases. Supplementation with PBCWs promoted macrophage activation from peritoneum and spleen, indicating that the PBCWs oral administration was able to improve the functionality of the macrophages. In addition, the PBCWs increased immunoglobulin A (IgA)-producing cells in the  lamina propria in a similar way to probiotic bacteria, but this supplementation did not have an effect on the population of goblet cells in the small intestine . These results indicate that the probiotic bacteria and their cell walls have an important immunoregulatory effect on the IECs without altering the homeostatic environment but with an increase in IgA+ producing cells and in the innate immune cells, mainly those distant from the  such as spleen and peritoneum.

Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is a bile  that may protect the intestinal barrier. We hypothesized that UDCA would protect the intestinal  in injury models. To test this hypothesis, we utilized an in vitro wound-healing assay and a mouse model of intestinal barrier injury. We found that UDCA stimulates intestinal epithelial cell migration in vitro, and this migration was blocked by inhibition of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), or ERK. Furthermore, UDCA stimulated both COX-2 induction and EGFR phosphorylation. In vivo UDCA protected the intestinal barrier from LPS-induced injury as measured by FITC dextran leakage into the serum. Using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine injections, we found that UDCA stimulated intestinal epithelial cell migration in these animals. These effects were blocked with either administration of Rofecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, or in EGFR-dominant negative Velvet mice, wherein UDCA had no effect on LPS-induced injury. Finally, we found increased COX-2 and phosphorylated ERK levels in LPS animals also treated with UDCA. Taken together, these data suggest that UDCA can stimulate intestinal epithelial cell migration and protect against acute intestinal injury via an EGFR- and COX-2-dependent mechanism. UDCA may be an effective treatment to prevent the early onset of -origin sepsis. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this study, we show that the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  stimulates intestinal epithelial cell migration after cellular injury and also protects the intestinal barrier in an acute rodent injury model, neither of which has been previously reported. These effects are dependent on epidermal growth factor receptor activation and downstream cyclooxygenase 2 upregulation in the small intestine.

We generated mice with intestinal epithelial tissue-specific overexpression of miR-222 to investigate the function of miR-222 in intestinal physiology and diseases . Transgenic expression of miR-222 inhibited mucosal growth and increased susceptibility to apoptosis in the small intestine, thus leading to mucosal atrophy. The miR-222-elevated intestinal  was vulnerable to pathological stress, since local overexpression of miR-222 not only delayed mucosal repair after ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury, but also exacerbated  barrier dysfunction induced by exposure to cecal ligation and puncture. miR-222 overexpression also decreased expression of the Wnt receptor Frizzled-7 (FZD7), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and tight junctions in the mucosal tissue. Mechanistically, we identified the  messenger ribonucleic  (mRNA) as a novel target of miR-222 and found that [miR-222/ mRNA] association repressed  mRNA translation. These results implicate miR-222 as a negative regulator of normal intestinal epithelial regeneration and protection by downregulating expression of multiple genes including the . Our findings also suggest a novel role of increased miR-222 in the pathogenesis of mucosal growth inhibition, delayed healing and barrier dysfunction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26555459>Two highly adhesive lactic  bacteria strains are protective in zebrafish infected with Aeromonas hydrophila by evocation of  mucosal immunity.</a></h1><p>To increase the knowledge of probiotic effects and potential mechanisms, we report on the use of the zebrafish model to investigate the in vivo colonization ability, as well as the protective effects associated with  mucosal immune barrier and responses against Aeromonas hydrophila infection of previously characterized probiotic lactic  bacteria (LAB) strains, Bacillus coagulans 09·712 and Lactobacillus plantarum 08·923, in comparison with that of three commercialized strains.The results indicated differential adhesion capabilities, and B. coagulans and Lact. plantarum strains exhibited a more robust adhesion capability based on fluorescence observation. Oral delivery of these two strains in zebrafish greatly improved   integrity, as well as reduced recruitment and degranulation of mast cells under Aer. hydrophila challenge. The percentage of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in probiotic fed groups was significantly higher than those in the control after challenge (P < 0·001). We also found that the abundance of IL-1β mRNA in B. coagulans- and Lact. plantarum-fed groups remarkably decreased as a function of time of post challenge, and that of TNF-α and IL-10 mRNA was high with the probiotic treatment.Our findings indicate highly adhesive strains of B. coagulans 09·712 and Lact. plantarum 08·923 have immunoregulatory and immunoprotective roles in effective stimulation of anti-inflammatory response and barrier regeneration within the mucosa to protect zebrafish against infection.Our work will further support zebrafish as a powerful model to better understand molecular definition of probiotic effects, as well as the probiotic potential of B. coagulans 09·712 and Lact. plantarum 08·923 of interest to the food industry.© 2015 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141995>Cecal Infusion of Sodium Propionate Promotes Intestinal Development and Jejunal Barrier Function in Growing Pigs.</a></h1><p>Short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) produced by microbial fermentation facilitate the differentiation and proliferation of intestinal epithelium. However, the role of individual SCFAs, such as propionate, on intestinal development is still unclear. In the present study, sixteen barrows fitted with a cecal fistula were randomly divided into two groups for cecal infusion of either saline (control group) or sodium propionate (propionate group). After 28 days, the length and the relative weight of intestinal segments were calculated, the intestinal morphology was assessed, and the expression of tight junction protein was measured using qPCR and Western blotting. Compared to the saline group, the length of the colon was significantly increased in the propionate group ( < 0.05). The jejunal villi length and villi/crypt ratio in the propionate group were significantly higher than in the saline group ( < 0.05). Furthermore, propionate infusion significantly upregulated the mRNA levels of  and the expression of Claudin-1, Claudin-4, and Occludin protein in the jejunal mucosa ( < 0.05).

Production of exopolysaccharides is an important feature of probiotic lactobacilli. It increases the chance of their survival in the gastrointestinal tract and promotes adhesion to the ; therefore, exopolysaccharides are important for the process of colonization. Two lactic  bacteria strains were used in this study: Lactobacillus rhamnosus KL 53A and Lactobacillus casei Fyos. Exopolysaccharides were isolated from bacterial cells and their monosaccharide composition was examined using liquid chromatography. The influence of exopolysaccharides on lactobacilli adhesion to enterocytes was studied after deglycosylation of the bacterial cells and incubation with the selected intestinal microbiota strains that metabolize polysaccharides - Faecalibacterium prausnitzii DSM 17677 and Blautia luti DSM 14534. Both deglycosylation and incubation with polysaccharide metabolizing strains influenced the ability of probiotic strains to adhere to enterocytes. Enzymatic deglycosylation decreased adhesion efficiency of L. rhamnosus KL 53A; however, co-incubation of both lactobacillus strains with F. prausnitzii DSM 17677 resulted in an increase of their adhesion efficiency. Exopolysaccharides are important adhesins of Lactobacillus spp. that influence their ability to colonize  . Other members of  microbiota can modify the adhesion property in situ ; therefore the composition and metabolic state of commensal bacteria may influence their probiotic action.© 2018 Corinna Konieczna et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28107445>Beta-Glucans Supplementation Associates with Reduction in P-Cresyl Sulfate Levels and Improved Endothelial Vascular Reactivity in Healthy Individuals.</a></h1><p>Oat and barley beta-glucans are prebiotic fibers known for their cholesterol-lowering activity, but their action on the human  microbiota metabolism is still under research. Although the induction of short-chain fatty  (SCFA) following their ingestion has previously been reported, no study has investigated their effects on proteolytic uremic toxins p-cresyl sulfate (pCS) and indoxyl sulfate (IS) levels, while others have failed to demonstrate an effect on the endothelial function measured through flow-mediated dilation (FMD).The aim of our study was to evaluate whether a nutritional intervention with a functional pasta enriched with beta-glucans could promote a saccharolytic shift on the  microbial metabolism and improve FMD.We carried out a pilot study on 26 healthy volunteers who underwent a 2-month dietary treatment including a daily administration of Granoro "Cuore Mio" pasta enriched with barley beta-glucans (3g/100g). Blood and urine routine parameters, serum pCS/IS and FMD were evaluated before and after the dietary treatment.The nutritional treatment significantly reduced LDL and total cholesterol, as expected. Moreover, following beta-glucans supplementation we observed a reduction of serum pCS levels and an increase of FMD, while IS serum levels remained unchanged.We demonstrated that a beta-glucans dietary intervention in healthy volunteers correlates with a saccharolytic shift on the  microbiota metabolism, as suggested by the decrease of pCS and the increase of SCFA, and associates with an improved endothelial reactivity. Our pilot study suggests, in addition to cholesterol, novel pCS-lowering properties of beta-glucans, worthy to be confirmed in large-scale trials and particularly in contexts where the reduction of the microbial-derived uremic toxin pCS is of critical importance, such as in chronic kidney disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25559083>Inferred metagenomic comparison of mucosal and fecal microbiota from individuals undergoing routine screening colonoscopy reveals similar differences observed during active inflammation.</a></h1><p>The mucosal microbiota lives in close proximity with the intestinal  and may interact more directly with the host immune system than the luminal/fecal bacteria.

The specific contribution of each bacterial species within a complex microbiota to the regulation of host lipid metabolism remains largely unknown.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of adult stem cell specification and differentiation. Here, we used intestinal stem cells (ISCs) as a model system to reveal the epigenetic changes coordinating gene expression programs during these processes. We found that two distinct epigenetic mechanisms participate in establishing the transcriptional program promoting ISC specification from embryonic progenitors. A large number of adult ISC signature genes are targets of repressive DNA methylation in embryonic intestinal epithelial progenitors. On the other hand, genes essential for embryonic development acquire H3K27me3 and are silenced during ISC specification. We also show that the repression of ISC signature genes as well as the activation of enterocyte specific genes is accompanied by a global loss of H2A.Z during ISCs differentiation. Our results reveal that, already during ISC specification, an extensive remodeling of chromatin both at promoters and distal regulatory elements organizes transcriptional landscapes operating in differentiated enterocytes, thus explaining similar chromatin modification patterns in the adult  .© The Author(s) 2017.

The goal of our study was to determine the effects of endogenous anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) on the permeability and inflammatory response of intestinal  under normal, inflammatory, and hypoxic conditions. Human intestinal mucosa was modeled using Caco-2 cells. Human tissue was collected from planned colorectal resections. Accumulation of AEA and 2-AG was achieved by inhibiting their metabolizing enzymes URB597 (a fatty  amide hydrolase inhibitor) and JZL184 (a monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor). Inflammation and ischemia were simulated with TNF-α and IFN-γ and oxygen deprivation. Permeability changes were measured by transepithelial electrical resistance. The role of the CB receptor was explored using CB-knockdown (CBKd) intestinal epithelial cells. Endocannabinoid levels were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Cytokine secretion was measured using multiplex and ELISA. URB597 and JZL184 caused a concentration-dependent increase in permeability  CB ( < 0.0001) and decreased cytokine production. Basolateral application of JZL184 decreased permeability  CB ( < 0.0001). URB597 and JZL184 increased the enhanced (worsened) permeability caused by inflammation and hypoxia ( < 0.0001 and  < 0.05). CBKd cells showed reduced permeability response to inflammation ( < 0.01) but not hypoxia. 2-AG levels were increased in response to inflammation and hypoxia in Caco-2 cells. In human mucosal tissue, inflammation increased the secretion of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, IL-12, -13, and -15, which was prevented with  treatment with URB597 and JZL184, and was inhibited by a CB antagonist.

Our objective was to determine the effects of supplemental Zn sources, in excess of minimal requirements, on markers of mammary epithelial integrity in blood and in milk as well as the heat stability of milk in mid-lactation cows. Twelve multiparous Holstein cows (132 ± 21 days in milk and 51 ± 3 kg/day milk) were blocked according to milk yield and enrolled in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square experiment. Experimental periods were 21 days, with 17 days allowed for diet adaptation and 4 days for sampling. Treatment sequences were randomly assigned to animals and treatments were as follows: (1) 0.97 g Zn/day provided as ZnSO (34.5 mg supplemental Zn/kg diet DM; 30-ZS), (2) 1.64 g Zn/day provided as ZnSO (56.5 mg supplemental Zn/kg diet DM; 60-ZS), and (3) 0.55 g Zn/day provided as ZnSO plus 1.13 g Zn/day provided as a zinc-methionine complex (58.2 mg supplemental Zn/kg diet DM; 60-ZM). Treatments were administered once daily as an oral bolus containing all supplemental trace minerals. Rumen-bypass methionine was also included in the 30-ZS and 60-ZS boluses to provide metabolizable methionine equivalent to that provided in 60-ZM rations. Milk samples were assessed for electrolytes, somatic cell transcript abundance of genes related to zinc metabolism, and heat coagulation time. Whole blood samples were analyzed for Na and K concentrations, and plasma samples were analyzed for lactose concentration. Cows fed 60-ZS or 60-ZM had greater zinc intake compared to 30-ZS. Dry matter intake and milk fat content tended to be greater in 60-ZS and 60-ZM cows compared to 30-ZS. Somatic cell linear score was similar among treatments. Treatments neither affected markers of mammary epithelial integrity in blood nor in milk of cows, including plasma concentration of lactose, milk concentrations of Na and K, and SLC30A2 and CLU transcript abundance. Treatments had no effect on milk N fractions or heat coagulation time.

Effects of prebiotic supplementation depend on site and age.</a></h1><p>Digestive disorders are common during the first few weeks of life of newborn calves. Prebiotics are nondigestible but fermentable oligosaccharides that modulate growth and activity of beneficial microbial populations, which can result in enhanced  health and function. Galactooligosaccharides (GOS) have demonstrated such prebiotic potential. In this study, the effect of GOS supplementation on intestinal bacterial community composition and fermentation profiles; intestinal health, development, and function; and growth was evaluated in dairy calves fed for high rates of growth. Eighty male Holstein calves were assigned either to a control treatment consisting of commercial milk replacer or to a GOS-rich (i.e., 3.4% of dry matter) milk replacer treatment. After 2 and 4wk, 8 calves per treatment were slaughtered at each age. Samples of intestinal digesta and tissue were collected for assessment of bacterial communities, short-chain fatty  concentrations, in vitro measurement of nutrient transport and permeability, histomorphology, and gastrointestinal organ size. The remaining 48 calves continued to wk 8 to measure body growth, nutrient intake, and fecal and respiratory scores. Calves fed GOS displayed greater Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium relative abundance and more developed intestinal epithelial structures, but also had greater fecal scores presumably related to greater colonic water secretion. Control calves showed slightly better growth and milk dry matter intake. Size of intestinal organs, intestinal nutrient transport, and  paracellular resistance were not affected by treatment. Excessive GOS supplementation had both prebiotic and laxative effects, which led to slightly lower growth performance while promoting commensal bacteria population and greater intestinal  growth.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

Therefore, the present study evaluated the effect of high-grain feeding persistence on the absorption kinetics of reticuloruminal SCFA, gene expression in the rumen , and the associated shifts in the epithelial bacteria in cows recovering from either a long-term continuous high-grain feeding model or a long-term transient high-grain feeding model. In a crossover study design, 8 nonlactating Holstein cows were fed 60% concentrate either continuously for 4 wk (continuous) or with a 1-wk break in the second week of the high-grain feeding (transient). After the high-grain feeding, all animals were fed a diet of 100% forage (recovery) for an additional 8 wk. Rumen papilla biopsies and SCFA absorption measurements were taken at the start of the trial (baseline), after the 4-wk high-grain feeding (49 d), after 2-wk recovery forage feeding (63 d), and after 8-wk recovery forage (105 d). Absorption of SCFA was determined in vivo using the washed and isolated reticulorumen technique. Rumen papillae biopsies were used for adherent bacterial DNA and host RNA extraction. The epithelial bacteria were determined using Illumina MiSeq (Microsynth AG, Balgach, Switzerland) sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. No significant effects of the high-grain feeding model were seen for bacterial diversity. However, bacterial diversity increased with time spent in the recovery forage feeding period regardless of feeding model. The relative abundance of Acidobacteria phyla and Acetivibrio spp. increased when animals were fed a transient high-grain feeding model. A trend toward increased CLDN4 expression was observed in the continuous model. Furthermore, there were interactions between feeding model and sampling day for gene targets CD14, DRA, NHE2, NHE3, and MCT2. When comparing length of recovery, in the continuous model increased relative absorption of SCFA was sustained at 63 d but dropped to baseline measurements at 105 d. A similar pattern was found with the transient model but it did not reach significance. The only gene target that was found to significantly correlate to relative absorption of SCFA was DRA (correlation coefficient ≤ -0.41). Whereas, genera Alkalibaculum, Anaerorhabdus, Coprococcus, and Dethiobacter all showed positive correlations to gene targets for pH regulation (NHE2 and NHE3) and SCFA uptake (MCT1) but negative correlations to SCFA absorption. We conclude that while the rumen absorption and epithelial bacteria were able to recover to baseline levels after 8 wk of forage feeding, the time needed for re-establishment of homeostasis in host gene expression is longer, especially when high-grain feeding is interrupted.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

TAG are the major fat components of infant formula, and their digestion requires pancreatic lipases, which may be naturally deficient in premature neonates. We hypothesise that NEC develops partly from the accumulation of incompletely digested long-chain TAG-containing unsaturated fatty  within the intestinal epithelial cells, leading to oxidative stress and enterocyte damage. We further hypothesise that the administration of a formula that contains reduced TAG ('pre-digested fat') that do not require lipase action may reduce NEC severity. To test these hypotheses, we induced NEC in neonatal mice using three different fat formulations, namely 'standard fat', 'pre-digested fat' or 'very low fat', and determined that mice fed 'standard fat' developed severe NEC, which was significantly reduced in mice fed 'pre-digested fat' or 'very low fat'. The expression level of the critical fat-digesting enzyme carboxyl ester lipase was significantly lower in the newborn compared with older pups, leading to impaired fat digestion. The accumulation of mal-digested fat resulted in the significant accumulation of fat droplets within the intestinal  of the distal ileum, resulting in the generation of reactive oxygen species and intestinal inflammation. Strikingly, these changes were prevented in pups fed 'pre-digested fat' or 'very low fat' formulas. These findings suggest that nutritional formula containing a pre-digested fat system may overcome the natural lipase deficiency of the premature , and serve as a novel approach to prevent NEC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31506421>Indole-3-propionic  inhibits  dysbiosis and endotoxin leakage to attenuate steatohepatitis in rats.</a></h1><p>Microbial metabolites have emerged as critical components that mediate the metabolic effects of the  microbiota.

IPA induces the expression of tight junction proteins, such as ZO-1 and Occludin, and maintains intestinal  homeostasis, leading to a reduction in plasma endotoxin levels. Interestingly, IPA inhibits NF-κB signaling and reduces the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6, in response to endotoxin in macrophages to repress hepatic inflammation and liver injury. Moreover, IPA is sufficient to inhibit the expression of fibrogenic and collagen genes and attenuate diet-induced NASH phenotypes. The beneficial effects of IPA on the liver are likely mediated through inhibiting the production of endotoxin in the . These findings suggest a protective role of IPA in the control of metabolism and uncover the  microbiome and liver cross-talk in regulating the intestinal microenvironment and liver pathology via a novel dietary nutrient metabolite.

This paper aims to review the relevant published materials on the influence of NFCs on the 's microbial population and composition in monogastrics, and points out the areas of the required research. Total bacteria count and Lactobacillus sp. were decreased with an increase in composition of dietary NFC intake, as well as accompanied by a decrease in the short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) levels. Consequently, some metabolites were affected by the accumulation of the bile , including molecules which control different gene expression levels, as regulators involved in glucose (FXR and TGR5) and fat metabolism (cholesterol). Cell proliferation rate of both gastrointestinal  and microbiome cells was negatively correlated with the dietary NFC levels in many species of monogastric animals. Low levels of NFC diet are negatively associated with digestibility, total  weight, and gastrointestinal secretions. High levels of dietary NFC have negative effects on the digestion and absorption of macronutrients, with an increase of the contact time of the carcinogens in the intestinal lumen. The data obtained from different animals' studies did not give the same results. In conclusion, dietary NFC should be adjusted to the optimal consumption levels as the human and the monogastric animals are anatomically and physiologically different. Digestion, metabolism, host wellbeing, and host behavior were negatively affected by the administration of high NFC levels. The relations between sulphate-reducing bacteria and some metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus and obesity need further exploration.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29689727>Vascular Cognitive Impairment and the  Microbiota.</a></h1><p>Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), the second most common cause of dementia in elderly people, is a term that refers to all forms of cognitive disorders that can be attributed to cerebrovascular disease such as manifestations of discrete infarctions, brain hemorrhages, and white matter lesions.

Among them, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in excess has been suspected to be detrimental for colonic  energy metabolism and DNA integrity. The first objective of this study was to evaluate in rats the epithelial response to an increased exposure to H2S. Experiments from colonocyte incubation and intra-colonic instillation indicate that low millimolar concentrations of the sulfide donor NaHS reversibly inhibited colonocyte mitochondrial oxygen consumption and increased gene expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (Hif-1α) together with inflammation-related genes namely inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNos) and interleukin-6 (Il-6). Additionally, rat colonocyte H2S detoxification capacity was severely impaired in the presence of nitric oxide. Based on the γH2AX ICW technique, NaHS did not induce DNA damage in colonocytes. Since H2S is notably produced by the  microbiota from sulfur containing amino , the second objective of the study was to investigate the effects of a high protein diet (HPD) on large intestine luminal sulfide content and on the expression of genes involved in H2S detoxification in colonocytes. We found that HPD markedly increased H2S content in the large intestine but the concomitant increase of the content mass maintained the luminal sulfide concentration. HPD also provoked an increase of sulfide quinone reductase (Sqr) gene expression in colonocytes, indicating an adaptive response to increased H2S bacterial production. In conclusion, low millimolar NaHS concentration severely affects colonocyte respiration in association with increased expression of genes associated with intestinal inflammation. Although HPD increases the sulfide content of the large intestine, the colonic adaptive responses to this modification limit the epithelial exposure to this deleterious bacterial metabolite.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This was further studied in human intestinal epithelial Caco-2/TC7 cells using the two main components of palm oil, i.e., palmitic and oleic . Saturated palmitic  impaired paracellular permeability and junctional protein localization, and induced inflammatory cytokine expression in the cells, but unsaturated oleic  did not. Inhibiting de novo ceramide synthesis prevented part of these effects. Altogether, our data show that short exposure to palm oil or palmitic  induces intestinal dysfunctions targeting barrier integrity and inflammation. Excessive palm oil consumption could be an early player in the  alterations observed in metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019.

There is emerging evidence that crosstalks between  epithelial cells and immune cells contribute to chronic infectious diseases. HIV-infected (HIV+) older adults show age-related co-morbidities at a younger age than their uninfected counterparts. Persistent inflammation related to the chronic viral infection and its sequelae is thought to contribute to this disparity. However, little is known about whether fish oil reduces intestinal inflammation in HIV + patients. We measure inflammation and  barrier function in HIV + older adults (median age = 52, N = 33), following 12 weeks of fish oil supplementation (a total daily dose of 1.6 g of omega-3 fatty ). We showed a reduction in inflammation and  permeability as measured by CD14, inflammatory cytokines, lipopolysaccharide, and lipopolysaccharide binding protein. The results indicate that older HIV + adults may benefit from a diet supplemented with the omega-3 fatty  found in fish oil.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26987580>Identification of a novel interaction between corticotropin releasing hormone (Crh) and macroautophagy.</a></h1><p>In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), compromised restitution of the epithelial barrier contributes to disease severity. Owing to the complexity in the pathogenesis of IBD, a variety of factors have been implicated in its progress. In this study, we report a functional interaction between macroautophagy and Corticotropin Releasing Hormone (Crh) in the . For this purpose we used DSS colitis model on Crh -/- or wild-type (wt) with pharmacological inhibition of autophagy. We uncovered sustained basal autophagy in the  of Crh -/- mice, which persisted over the course of DSS administration. Autophagy inhibition resulted in partial rescue of Crh -/- mice, while it increased the expression of Crh in the wt . Similarly, Crh deficiency was associated with sustained activation of base line autophagy. In vitro models of amino  deprivation- and LPS-induced autophagy confirmed the in vivo findings. Our results indicate a novel role for Crh in the intestinal  that involves regulation of autophagy, while suggesting the complementary action of the two pathways. These data suggest the intriguing possibility that targeting Crh stimulation in the intestine may provide a novel therapeutic approach to support the integrity of the epithelial barrier and to protect from chronic colitis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31024501>Beyond  Instinct: Metabolic Short-Chain Fatty  Moderate the Pathogenesis of Alphaherpesviruses.</a></h1><p>Short-chain fatty  (SCFA), such as sodium butyrate (SB), sodium propionate (SPr), and sodium acetate (SAc), are metabolic end-products of the fermentation of dietary fibers. They are linked with multiple beneficial effects on the general mammalian health, based on the sophisticated interplay with the host immune response. Equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV1) is a major pathogen, which primarily replicates in the respiratory , and disseminates through the body via a cell-associated viremia in leukocytes, even in the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Infected monocytic CD172a cells and T-lymphocytes transmit EHV1 to the endothelium of the endometrium or central nervous system (CNS), causing reproductive or neurological disorders. Here, we questioned whether SCFA have a potential role in shaping the pathogenesis of EHV1 during the primary replication in the URT, during the cell-associated viremia, or at the level of the endothelium of the pregnant uterus and/or CNS. First, we demonstrated the expression of SCFA receptors, FFA2 and FFA3, within the  of the equine respiratory tract, at the cell surface of immune cells, and equine endothelium. Subsequently, EHV1 replication was evaluated in the URT, in the presence or absence of SB, SPr, or SAc. In general, we demonstrated that SCFA do not affect the number of viral plaques or virus titer upon primary viral replication. Only SB and SPr were able to reduce the plaque latitudes. Similarly, pretreatment of monocytic CD172a cells and T-lymphocytes with different concentrations of SCFA did not alter the number of infected cells. When endothelial cells were treated with SB, SPr, or SAc, prior to the co-cultivation with EHV1-inoculated mononuclear cells, we observed a reduced number of adherent immune cells to the target endothelium. This was associated with a downregulation of endothelial adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in the presence of SCFA, which ultimately lead to a significant reduction of the EHV1 endothelial plaques. These results indicate that physiological concentrations of SCFA may affect the pathogenesis of EHV1, mainly at the target endothelium, in favor of the fitness of the horse. Our findings may have significant implications to develop innovative therapies, to prevent the devastating clinical outcome of EHV1 infections.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28275681>Gastrointestinal Organoids: Understanding the Molecular Basis of the Host-Microbe Interface.</a></h1><p>In recent years, increasing attention has been devoted to the concept that microorganisms play an integral role in human physiology and pathophysiology. Despite this, the molecular basis of host-pathogen and host-symbiont interactions in the human intestine remains poorly understood owing to the limited availability of human tissue, and the biological complexity of host-microbe interactions. Over the past decade, technological advances have enabled long-term culture of organotypic intestinal tissue derived from human subjects and from human pluripotent stem cells, and these in vitro culture systems already have shown the potential to inform our understanding significantly of host-microbe interactions. Gastrointestinal organoids represent a substantial advance in structural and functional complexity over traditional in vitro cell culture models of the human gastrointestinal  while retaining much of the genetic and molecular tractability that makes in vitro experimentation so appealing. The opportunity to model epithelial barrier dynamics, cellular differentiation, and proliferation more accurately in specific intestinal segments and in tissue containing a proportional representation of the diverse epithelial subtypes found in the native  greatly enhances the translational potential of organotypic gastrointestinal culture systems. By using these tools, researchers have uncovered novel aspects of host-pathogen and host-symbiont interactions with the intestinal . Application of these tools promises to reveal new insights into the pathogenesis of infectious disease, inflammation, cancer, and the role of microorganisms in intestinal development.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ileal bacteria in modulating local and systemic immune responses in AS.Ileal biopsies were obtained from 50 HLA-B27 patients with AS and 20 normal subjects. Silver stain was used to visualise bacteria. Ileal expression of tight and adherens junction proteins was investigated by TaqMan real-time (RT)-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Serum levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS-binding protein (LPS-BP), intestinal fatty -BP (iFABP) and zonulin were assayed by ELISA. Monocyte immunological functions were studied in in vitro experiments. In addition the effects of antibiotics on tight junctions in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 transgenic (TG) rats were assessed.Adherent and invasive bacteria were observed in the  of patients with AS with the bacterial scores significantly correlated with  inflammation. Impairment of the  vascular barrier (GVB) was also present in AS, accompanied by significant upregulation of zonulin, and associated with high serum levels of LPS, LPS-BP, iFABP and zonulin. In in vitro studies zonulin altered endothelial tight junctions while its epithelial release was modulated by isolated AS ileal bacteria. AS circulating monocytes displayed an anergic phenotype partially restored by ex vivo stimulation with LPS+sCD14 and their stimulation with recombinant zonulin induced a clear M2 phenotype. Antibiotics restored tight junction function in HLA-B27 TG rats.Bacterial ileitis, increased zonulin expression and damaged intestinal mucosal barrier and GVB, characterises the  of patients with AS and are associated with increased blood levels of zonulin, and bacterial products.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide and its etiology is strongly influenced by nutrition and high fat/high carbohydrate Western-style diet. Human epidemiological and animal studies have shown that colonic cancer risk is also related to faecal bile  concentration. Abnormally high levels of bile  (BA) trigger the colonic mucosa with a plethora of detrimental effects such as DNA oxidative damage, inflammation and hyperproliferation that highly promote CRC progression in post-initiation phase. The Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear receptor that transcriptionally mediates the signalling activity of BAs. FXR regulates BA metabolism mainly maintaining BA concentrations within a physiological range, thereby preventing BA-induced cytotoxicity. In fact, loss of FXR is associated with higher BA concentrations and with a pro-tumorigenic phenotype. Here we explore the liaison connecting nutrition, intestinal  renewal, BA and their nuclear receptor FXR in CRC. Moreover, we summarize evidence linking BA and CRC, as well as examine current understanding of the protumoral actions of BA and the bona fide antitumoral properties of FXR.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Sulforaphane (SFN), an isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables, has been proven to be highly effective in inhibiting cancer. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential roles of the  microbiota in the inhibition of BBN-induced bladder cancer by SFN.N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine is used to induce bladder cancer in male C57BL/6 mice, with or without SFN for 23 weeks. SFN ameliorates the histological changes characteristic of bladder cancer, resulting in fewer submucosal capillaries. SFN normalizes  microbiota dysbiosis in mice with BBN-induced bladder cancer with a significant increase in Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium cluster I. SFN also increases butyric  levels in the mouse colon, and repairs the injury to the mucosal  of the colon and cecum through the upregulation of the expression of tight junction proteins and GLP2. SFN greatly decreases the release of cytokines (IL-6) and secretory immunoglobulin A in the mice with bladder cancer.These results suggest that SFN protects against chemical-induced bladder cancer through normalizing the composition of  microbiota and repairing the physiological destruction of the  barrier, as well as decreasing inflammation and the immune response.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, its protein expression in human organs and significance in human diseases are unknown. The objective of this study was to analyze HHLA2 protein expression in normal human tissues and cancers, as well as its prognostic significance, to explore mechanisms regulating HHLA2 expression, and to identify candidate HHLA2 receptors.An immunohistochemistry protocol and a flow cytometry assay with newly generated monoclonal antibodies were developed to examine HHLA2 protein. HHLA2 gene copy-number variation was analyzed from cancer genomic data. The combination of bioinformatics analysis and immunologic approaches was established to explore HHLA2 receptors.HHLA2 protein was detected in trophoblastic cells of the placenta and the  of , kidney, gallbladder, and breast, but not in most other organs. In contrast, HHLA2 protein was widely expressed in human cancers from the breast, lung, thyroid, melanoma, pancreas, ovary, liver, bladder, colon, prostate, kidney, and esophagus. In a cohort of 50 patients with stage I-III triple-negative breast cancer, 56% of patients had aberrant expression of HHLA2 on their tumors, and high HHLA2 expression was significantly associated with regional lymph node metastasis and stage. The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that HHLA2 copy-number gains were present in 29% of basal breast cancers, providing a potential mechanism for increased HHLA2 protein expression in breast cancer. Finally, Transmembrane and Immunoglobulin Domain Containing 2 (TMIGD2) was identified as one of the receptors for HHLA2.Wide expression of HHLA2 in human malignancies, together with its association with poor prognostic factors and its T-cell coinhibitory capability, suggests that the HHLA2 pathway represents a novel immunosuppressive mechanism within the tumor microenvironment and an attractive target for human cancer therapy.©2014 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26769134>Caenorhabditis elegans susceptibility to  Enterococcus faecalis infection is associated with fat metabolism and epithelial junction integrity.</a></h1><p> bacteria-host interactions have been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous human diseases, but few mechanisms have been described. The genetically tractable nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans can be infected with pathogenic bacteria, such as the human  commensal Enterococcus faecalis, via feeding, making it a good model for studying these interactions.An RNAi screen of 17 worm candidate genes revealed that knockdown of the transcription factor nhr-49, a master regulator of fat metabolism, shortens worm lifespan upon infection with E. faecalis (and other potentially pathogenic bacteria) compared to Escherichia coli. The functional similarity of nhr-49 to the mammalian peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) suggests that this is mediated through a link between fatty  metabolism and innate immunity. In addition, knockdown of either dlg-1 or ajm-1, which encode physically interacting proteins in the C. elegans epithelial junction, also reduces worm lifespan upon E. faecalis challenge, demonstrating the importance of the intestinal  as an immune barrier.The protective roles identified for nhr-49, dlg-1, and ajm-1 suggest mechanistic interactions between the  microbiota, host fatty  metabolism, innate immunity, and epithelial junction integrity that are remarkably similar to those implicated in human metabolic and inflammatory diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29077918>The interactive effect of dietary n-6: n-3 fatty  ratio and vitamin E level on tissue lipid peroxidation, DNA damage in intestinal epithelial cells, and  morphology in chickens of different ages.</a></h1><p>Feeding chickens diets high in n-3 fatty  (FA) increases their incorporation into tissue lipids, but leads to oxidative stress in cells. This study investigated the effect of the dietary polyunsaturated FA ratio (PUFA n-6: n-3) and vitamin E (vE) level on DNA damage and morphological changes in the   of chickens. One-day-old female broiler chicks (n = 176) were divided into 4 groups fed for 43 d diets with a high (HR) or low (LR) PUFA n-6: n-3 ratio and supplemented with 50 or 300 mg vE kg-1. Performance was calculated for periods of d 1 to 9, d 9 to 16, d 9 to 35, and d 9 to 42, while organs were sampled at d 9, d 17, d 36, and d 43. At d 17 and d 43, DNA damage of epithelial cells in the duodenum and jejunum was measured and duodenal and jejunal morphology was analyzed. HR diets improved FCR for the periods of d 1 to 9, d 9 to 16 and d 9 to 42, whereas the increased vE level improved FCR for the period of d 9 to 16. In the jejunum DNA damage was greater in chickens fed LR than HR diets at d 17 (P < 0.001) and the increased vE level promoted DNA damage in both intestinal segments (P < 0.02) in younger birds. The morphology of the duodenum was marginally affected by the diets, whereas LR diets in the jejunum reduced villus surface area at d 17 (P = 0.022), and mucosa thickness (P = 0.029) and villus height (P = 0.035) at d 43. The results indicated that feeding birds LR diets and vE levels significantly exceeding the recommendation induced DNA damage in epithelial cells, but this effect varied depending on the intestinal segment and the age of birds.© The Author 2017.

Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3) recognizes double-stranded RNA, a virus-associated molecular pattern. Activation of TLR-3 with Poly(I:C), a synthetic agonist, modulates tissue repair and permeability in other epithelia; however, the effects of local luminal TLR-3 agonists on  barrier function are unknown. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate short-term effects of Poly(I:C) on rat ileal and colonic permeability ex vivo. We also studied the acute effects of intrarectal administration of Poly(I:C) on colonic barrier function. Ileum tissues displayed decreased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) 1h after incubation with 200μg/mL Poly(I:C); however, the mucosa-to-serosa transit of macromolecules (4.4 and 40kDa dextrans - TD4.4 and FD40, respectively) remained unchanged. Conversely, colon tissue preparations stimulated with 200μg/mL Poly(I:C) showed a decreased thinning of the mucosal layer after 2h and a decreased transit of FD40 after 3h, in comparison to controls. There was no change in colonic TEER after 3h of treatment. In addition, colon tissue taken from rats 6h after an intrarectal administration of 100μg Poly(I:C) also showed decreased permeability to FD40 in the everted  sac assay at 3h post-extraction. Tissue morphology remained unchanged. Our results suggest that an acute exposure to Poly(I:C) reduces colon permeability to macromolecules but increases ileum permeability to electrolytes/small molecules ex vivo. Although the mechanism associated to these effects needs further investigation, to our knowledge this is the first report of a direct effect of a TLR-3 ligand in intestinal barrier function and may be of significance to understand region-specific interactions between  mucosa and microbiota.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Screening of a panel of mouse tissues revealed that Clec2e transcripts are restricted to the gastrointestinal tract. Using Clr-a-specific mAb, we characterize Clr-a as a disulfide-linked homodimeric cell surface glycoprotein. Of note, a substantial fraction of Clr-a molecules are retained intracellularly, and analyses of Clr-a/Clr-f hybrids attribute intracellular retention to both the stalk region and parts of the cytoplasmic domain. Combining quantitative PCR analyses with immunofluorescence studies revealed exclusive expression of Clr-a by intestinal epithelial cells and crypt cells throughout the .

These effects have been speculated to occur via the  microbiome. In this study, we administered either berberine or metformin to db/db mice and investigated changes in body weight, food intake, and blood glucose levels. Fresh stool samples were analyzed using 16 s rDNA high-throughput sequencing to evaluate the  microbiome. Short-chain fatty  (SCFA) in the stool were quantified using gas chromatography. The expression of NF-κB signaling pathway and tight junction (ZO1 and occludin) proteins in the intestinal  was determined using qPCR and western blotting. The intestinal barrier structure was examined using transmission electron microscopy and serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was measured using a commercial kit. Both berberine and metformin reduced food intake, body weight, and blood glucose and HbA1c levels. Both treatments effectively restored the intestinal SCFA content, reduced the level of serum LPS, relieved intestinal inflammation, and repaired intestinal barrier structure. Intervention with metformin or berberine modified the  microbiome in db/db mice, increasing the number of SCFA-producing bacteria (e.g., Butyricimonas, Coprococcus, Ruminococcus) and reducing opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Prevotella, Proteus). An increased abundance of other probiotics including Lactobacillus and Akkermansia was also observed. Berberine and metformin can modulate the composition of the  microbiome and reduce body weight, blood glucose levels, and intestinal inflammation in db/db mice, which demonstrates their effectiveness in the reduction of diabetic complications in this model.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We aimed at profiling miRNAs in alcoholic hepatitis (AH) and identifying miRNAs potentially involved in liver injury.MiRNA profiling was performed in liver samples from patients with AH, alcohol liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, HCV disease and normal liver tissue. Expression of miRNAs was assessed in liver and serum from patients with AH and animal models. Mimic and decoy miR-182 were used in vitro and in vivo to evaluate miR-182's biological functions.MiRNA expression profile in liver was highly altered in AH and distinctive from alcohol-induced cirrhotic livers. Moreover, we identified a set of 18 miRNAs predominantly expressed in AH as compared with other chronic liver conditions. Integrative miRNA-mRNA functional analysis revealed the association of AH-altered miRNAs with nuclear receptors, IGF-1 signalling and cholestasis. Interestingly, miR-182 was the most highly expressed miRNA in AH, which correlated with degree of ductular reaction, disease severity and short-term mortality. MiR-182 mimic induced an upregulation of inflammatory mediators in biliary cells. At experimental level, miR-182 was increased in biliary cells in mice fed with 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet but not upregulated by alcohol intake or fibrosis. Inhibition of miR-182 in DDC-fed mice reduced liver damage, bile  accumulation and inflammatory response.AH is characterised by a deregulated miRNA profile, including miR-182, which is associated with disease severity and liver injury. These results highlight the potential of miRNAs as therapeutic targets and biomarkers in AH.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Most notable amongst the latter are the insulin-synthesizing β-cells, loss or dysfunction of which manifests in diabetes mellitus. All exocrine and endocrine cells derive from multipotent pancreatic progenitor cells arising from the primitive   via inductive interactions with adjacent mesodermal tissues. Research in the last two decades has revealed the identity of many of these extrinsic cues and they include signaling molecules used in many other developmental contexts such as retinoic , fibroblast growth factors, and members of the TGF-β superfamily. As important as these inductive cues is the absence of other signaling molecules such as hedgehog family members. Much has been learned about the interactions of extrinsic factors with fate regulators intrinsic to the pancreatic endoderm. This new knowledge has had tremendous impact on the development of directed differentiation protocols for converting pluripotent stem cells to β-cells in vitro.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in tissue fibrosis. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of soluble dietary fiber on radiation-induced intestinal EMT and fibrosis in a mouse model.Apple pectin (4% wt/wt in drinking water) was administered to wild-type and pVillin-Cre-EGFP transgenic mice with intestinal fibrosis induced by a single dose of abdominal irradiation of 10 Gy. The effects of pectin on intestinal EMT and fibrosis,  microbiota, and short-chain fatty  (SCFA) concentration were evaluated.Intestinal fibrosis in late radiation enteropathy showed increased submucosal thickness and subepithelial collagen deposition. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)/vimentin and EGFP/α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) coexpressing cells were most clearly observed at 2 weeks after irradiation and gradually decreased at 4 and 12 weeks. Pectin significantly attenuated the thickness of submucosa and collagen deposition at 12 weeks (24.3 vs 27.6 µm in the pectin + radiation-treated group compared with radiation-alone group, respectively, P < .05; 69.0% vs 57.1%, P < .001) and ameliorated EMT at 2 and 4 weeks. Pectin also modulated the intestinal microbiota composition and increased the luminal SCFA concentration.The soluble dietary fiber pectin protected the terminal ileum against radiation-induced fibrosis. This effect might be mediated by altered SCFA concentration in the intestinal lumen and reduced EMT in the ileal .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29290146>Multifunctional Role of 35 Kilodalton Hyaluronan in Promoting Defense of the Intestinal .</a></h1><p>Intestinal  plays a critical role in host defense against orally acquired pathogens. Dysregulation of this protective barrier is a primary driver of inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's and ulcerative colitis) and also infant gastrointestinal infections. Previously, our lab reported that hyaluronan (HA) isolated from human milk induces the expression of the antimicrobial peptide β-defensin in vivo and protects against Salmonella Typhimurium infection of epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, we demonstrated that commercially available 35 kDa size HA induces the expression of β-defensin, upregulates the expression of tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and attenuates murine Citrobacter rodentium infection in vivo. In this current study, we report that HA35 remains largely intact and biologically active during transit through the digestive tract where it directly induces β-defensin expression upon epithelial cell contact. We also demonstrate HA35 abrogation of murine Salmonella Typhimurium infection as well as downregulation of leaky tight junction protein claudin-2 expression. Taken together, we propose a dual role for HA in host innate immune defense at the epithelial cell surface, acting to induce antimicrobial peptide production and also block pathogen-induced leaky . HA35 is therefore a promising therapeutic in the defense against bacterially induced colitis in compromised adults and vulnerable newborns.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26457763>Automated Solution-Phase Synthesis of Insect Glycans to Probe the Binding Affinity of Pea Enation Mosaic Virus.</a></h1><p>Pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV)--a plant RNA virus transmitted exclusively by aphids--causes disease in multiple food crops. However, the aphid-virus interactions required for disease transmission are poorly understood. For virus transmission, PEMV binds to a heavily glycosylated receptor aminopeptidase N in the pea aphid  and is transcytosed across the   into the aphid body cavity prior to release in saliva as the aphid feeds. To investigate the role of glycans in PEMV-aphid interactions and explore the possibility of viral control through blocking a glycan interaction, we synthesized insect N-glycan terminal trimannosides by automated solution-phase synthesis. The route features a mannose building block with C-5 ester enforcing a β-linkage, which also provides a site for subsequent chain extension. The resulting insect N-glycan terminal trimannosides with fluorous tags were used in a fluorous microarray to analyze binding with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled PEMV; however, no specific binding between the insect glycan and PEMV was detected. To confirm these microarray results, we removed the fluorous tag from the trimannosides for isothermal titration calorimetry studies with unlabeled PEMV. The ITC studies confirmed the microarray results and suggested that this particular glycan-PEMV interaction is not involved in virus uptake and transport through the aphid.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26439723>Gastrointestinal stability of urolithins: an in vitro approach.</a></h1><p>Urolithins are bioactive ellagitannin-derived metabolites showing a wide phenotypic variation in their production by the  microbiota. This work represents a first in vitro step toward the development of new strategies focused on the oral supplementation of urolithins with the aim of overcoming their selective production and making their putative health benefits available for the whole population.In order to study their gastrointestinal stability, urolithin A, urolithin B, and urolithin B-glucuronide, as well as ellagic , were subjected to a simulated gastrointestinal digestion model consisting of oral, gastric, and pancreatic steps followed by a 24-h fecal fermentation. The effect of the entero-hepatic recirculation on urolithin B-glucuronide, a phase II metabolite, was also investigated.Urolithin B was the molecule able to resist to a greater extent the conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, while urolithin A and ellagic  were drastically unstable during the colonic step. Conjugation with glucuronic , ideally occurring in the liver, conferred to urolithin B an increased stability, which may be interesting in the framework of entero-hepatic recirculation.This set of experiments lets hypothesize that orally supplemented urolithins may come into contact with the colonic  and become accessible for uptake or exert local anti-inflammatory activity, overcoming the limitations of enterotypes unable to convert ellagitannins into these putatively beneficial metabolites.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29462405> barrier function: Effects of (antibiotic) growth promoters on key barrier components and associations with growth performance.</a></h1><p>The  barrier, comprising the microbiota and their products, mucus layers, host-derived antimicrobial compounds [e.g., host defense peptides (HDP), IgA], , and underlying immune tissues, performs the essential function of preventing the passage of harmful microorganisms and substances into the body, while enabling the acquisition of dietary nutrients. Antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) are widely accepted as the "gold standard" of performance-enhancing feed additives, which had become integral and valuable components of modern, efficient animal production, but are now being phased out in many parts of the world. This review, therefore, examines the reported effects of AGP on the key components of  barrier function, particularly where corresponding (positive) growth performance data were provided to indicate that any changes were beneficial, and some important trends do emerge. Certain bacterial families (e.g., Lachnospiraceae), genera (e.g., Faecalibacterium, Propionibacterium, and Ruminococcus), or species (e.g., F. prausnitzii, B. fragilis, and some Lactobacillus spp.) have been reported to increase with AGP use, are associated with improved growth performance, and show benefit across species, which may be related to their production of short-chain fatty  (SCFA). Various studies have investigated the effects of AGP on mucus-related parameters (e.g., goblet cell size, density, and mucin mRNA expression) but these do not always seem to correlate well with the actual physical characteristics of the mucus layer(s). Surprisingly, there are little data relating to HDP or IgA, even though they have recognized benefits. There are clear AGP benefits on epithelial structure and function (e.g., nutrient digestibility), and these may (currently) provide the most reliable indicators of the efficacy of growth promoters. Data investigating effects on  immune parameters (e.g., cell populations, cytokines, and chemokines), with corresponding growth performance, are limited and require further detailed interrogation. This review highlights both important observations related to the effects of AGP on key  barrier components, with associated growth performance, and areas that require further investigation, thus providing an informative basis for assessing the potential of AGP alternatives.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25613998>Cloning and characterization of a novel sigma-like glutathione S-transferase from the giant panda parasitic nematode, Baylisascaris schroederi.</a></h1><p>Baylisascaris schroederi, an intestinal nematode of the giant panda, is the cause of the often fatal disease, baylisascariasis. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are versatile enzymes that can affect parasite survival and parasite-host interactions and, are therefore, potential targets for the development of diagnostic tests and vaccines.In this study, we identified a full-length cDNA that encoded a novel, secretory sigma-like GST (Bsc-GSTσ) from a B. schroederi-omic dataset. Following cloning and sequencing, sequence and structural analyses and comparative modeling were performed using online-bioinformatics and proteomics tools. The recombinant Bsc-GSTσ (rBsc-GSTσ) protein was prokaryotically expressed and then used to detect antigenicity and reactivity using immunoblotting assays. In addition, the native protein in female adult B. schroederi was located via immunofluorescence techniques, while the preliminary ELISA-based serodiagnostic potential of rBsc-GSTσ was assessed in native and infected mouse sera.Bsc-GSTσ contained a 621-bp open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide of 206 amino  with two typical sigma GST domain profiles, including a GST_N_Sigma_like at the N-terminus and a GST_C_Sigma_like at the C-terminus. The presence of an N-terminal signal sequence indicated that Bsc-GSTσ was a secretory protein. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses showed that Bsc-GSTσ was a nematode-specific member of the Sigma class GSTs and shared the closest genetic distance with its homologue in Ascaris suum. Further comparative structure analyses indicated that Bsc-GSTσ possessed the essential structural motifs (e.g., βαβαββα) and the consensus secondary or tertiary structure that is typical for other characterized GSTσs. Immunolocalization revealed strong distributions of native Bsc-GSTσ in the body hypodermis, lateral chords,  ,  microvilli, oviduct , and ovaries of adult female worms, similar to its homologue in A. suum. Building on good immunogenic properties, rBsc-GSTσ-based ELISA exhibited a sensitivity of 79.1% and a specificity of 82.0% to detect anti-B. schroederi IgG antibodies in the sera of experimentally infected mice.This study presents a comprehensive demonstration of sequence and structural-based analysis of a new, secretory sigma-like GST from a nematode, and its good serodiagnostic performance suggests that rBsc-GSTσ has the potential to detect B. schroederi and, therefore, could be used to develop an ELISA-based serological test to diagnose baylisascariasis in giant pandas.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29653264>Helminth infection in mice improves insulin sensitivity via modulation of  microbiota and fatty  metabolism.</a></h1><p>Intestinal helminths are prevalent in individuals who live in rural areas of developing countries, where obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome are rare. In the present study, we analyzed the modulation of the  microbiota in mice infected with the helminth Strongyloides venezuelensis, and fed either a standard rodent chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD). To investigate the effects of the microbiota modulation on the metabolism, we analyzed the expression of tight-junction proteins present in the  , inflammatory markers in the serum and tissue and quantified glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and resistance. Additionally, the levels of lipids related to inflammation were evaluated in the feces and serum. Our results show that infection with Strongyloides venezuelensis results in a modification of the  microbiota, most notably by increasing Lactobacillus spp. These modifications in the microbiota alter the host metabolism by increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, switching macrophages from a M1 to M2 pattern in the adipose tissue, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins in the intestinal cells (thereby reducing the permeability) and decreasing LPS in the serum. Taken together, these changes correlate with improved insulin signaling and sensitivity, which could also be achieved with HFD mice treated with probiotics. Additionally, helminth infected mice produce higher levels of oleic , which participates in anti-inflammatory pathways. These results suggest that modulation of the microbiota by helminth infection or probiotic treatment causes a reduction in subclinical inflammation, which has a positive effect on the glucose metabolism of the host.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Although several defensive strategies are present in this organ, its organization and function may be disturbed by some insecticidal agents, including bioactive proteins like lectins and protease inhibitors (PIs) from plants. PIs interfere with digestion, leading to poor nutrient absorption and decreasing amino  bioavailability. Intake of PIs can delay development, cause deformities and reduce fertility. Ingestion of PIs may lead to changes in the set of proteases secreted in the insect , but this response is often insufficient and results in aggravation of the malnutrition status. Lectins are proteins that are able to interact with glycoconjugates, including those linked to cell surfaces. Their effects on the midgut include disruption of the peritrophic matrix, brush border and secretory cell layer; induction of apoptosis and oxidative stress; interference with nutrient absorption and transport proteins; and damaging effects on symbionts. In addition, lectins can cross the intestinal barrier and reach the hemolymph. The establishment of resistant insect populations due to selective pressure resulting from massive use of a bioactive protein is an actual possibility, but this can be minimized by the multiple mode-of-action of these proteins, mainly the lectins.© 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30315602>Effects of L-methionine on performance,  morphology and antioxidant status in  and liver of piglets in relation to DL-methionine.</a></h1><p>This study investigated the hypothesis that dietary supplementation of L-methionine (L-Met) in weaned piglets in relation to DL-methionine (DL-Met) results in a higher antioxidant status and lower need for antioxidant enzyme activation in intestinal  and body tissues, and improves  morphology and  barrier function as well as performance. A total of 99 early-weaned 21-day old piglets were allotted to six groups and fed a semi-synthetic wheat-barley-based basal diet supplemented with 0.067%, 0.107% and 0.147% of either DL-Met (MetAmino; Evonik, Hanau, Germany) or L-Met (L-Met100; CJ Europe, Schwalbach am Taunus, Germany) to reach dietary Met concentrations of 0.16%, 0.20% and 0.24%, of which the latter met the requirements for maintenance and growth based on a pre-experiment. Feed intake and body weights were recorded weekly, and samples of plasma, liver and duodenum and jejunum mucosa were collected after 3 weeks at slaughter. Plasma concentrations of L-Met were similar, and those of D-Met and total Met were higher in piglets fed DL-Met in relation to those fed L-Met. Feed intake, daily gains and feed:gain ratio, and the relative bio-efficacy based on gains and feed:gain ratio were similar for both groups. Likewise, villi length, crypt depth, the villi length:crypt depth ratio in duodenum and jejunum and gene expression of tight junction proteins in the jejunum did not differ. Concentrations of antioxidants like glutathione and tocopherol, the total antioxidant capacity, the mRNA abundance or activity of antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, concentrations of thiobarbituric  reactive substances, markers for oxidative damage of lipids and the expression of inflammatory genes were similar in liver and jejunum mucosa. These data indicate that the effects of L-Met and DL-Met supplementation are comparable considering both piglet performance and parameters of  health and function like  morphology and the intestinal antioxidant status.© 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27458380>The Extracellular Calcium-Sensing Receptor in the Intestine: Evidence for Regulation of Colonic Absorption, Secretion, Motility, and Immunity.</a></h1><p>Different from other epithelia, the intestinal  has the complex task of providing a barrier impeding the entry of toxins, food antigens, and microbes, while at the same time allowing for the transfer of nutrients, electrolytes, water, and microbial metabolites. These molecules/organisms are transported either transcellularly, crossing the apical and basolateral membranes of enterocytes, or paracellularly, passing through the space between enterocytes. Accordingly, the intestinal  can affect energy metabolism, fluid balance, as well as immune response and tolerance. To help accomplish these complex tasks, the intestinal  has evolved many sensing receptor mechanisms. Yet, their roles and functions are only now beginning to be elucidated. This article explores one such sensing receptor mechanism, carried out by the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). In addition to its established function as a nutrient sensor, coordinating food digestion, nutrient absorption, and regulating energy metabolism, we present evidence for the emerging role of CaSR in the control of intestinal fluid homeostasis and immune balance. An additional role in the modulation of the enteric nerve activity and motility is also discussed. Clearly, CaSR has profound effects on many aspects of intestinal function. Nevertheless, more work is needed to fully understand all functions of CaSR in the intestine, including detailed mechanisms of action and specific pathways involved. Considering the essential roles CaSR plays in gastrointestinal physiology and immunology, research may lead to a translational opportunity for the development of novel therapies that are based on CaSR's unique property of using simple nutrients such as calcium, polyamines, and certain amino /oligopeptides as activators. It is possible that, through targeting of intestinal CaSR with a combination of specific nutrients, oral solutions that are both inexpensive and practical may be developed to help in conditioning the  microenvironment and in maintaining digestive health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28212864>GPR43 activation enhances psoriasis-like inflammation through epidermal upregulation of IL-6 and dual oxidase 2 signaling in a murine model.</a></h1><p>The  is densely inhabited by commensal bacteria, which metabolize dietary fibers/undigested carbohydrates and produce short-chain fatty  such as acetate. GPR43 is one of the receptors to sense short-chain fatty , and expressed in various immune and non-immune cells. Acetate/GPR43 signaling has been shown to affect various inflammatory diseases through Th17 responses and NADPH oxidase (NOX)-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. However, no study has previously explored the effects of GPR43 activation during psoriasis-like inflammation. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of acetate/phenylacetamide (GPR43 agonists) on imiquimod induced skin inflammation in mice. Mice were administered phenylacetamide/acetate followed by assessment of skin inflammation, NOXs (NOX-2, NOX-4, dual oxidases), and Th17 related signaling. Our study showed induction of epidermal GPR43 after imiquimod treatment, i.e. psoriasis-like inflammation. Acetate administration in psoriatic mice led to further increase in skin inflammation (ear thickness/myeloperoxidase activity) with concurrent increase in Th17 immune responses and epidermal dual oxidase-2 signaling. Further, topical application of GPR43 agonist, phenylacetamide led to enhanced ear thickness with concomitant epidermal IL-6 signaling as well as dual oxidase-2 upregulation which may be responsible for increased psoriasis-like inflammation. Taken together, dual oxidase-2 and IL-6 play important roles in GPR43-mediated skin inflammation. The current study suggests that GPR43 activation in psoriatic patients may lead to aggravation of psoriatic inflammation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Seven pairs of newborn twin lambs were used. Within each pair, lambs were assigned to receive an oral infusion of SB at 0.36 g/kg body weight (BW) (SB, n = 7) or the same volume of saline (Con, n = 7). Treatments were administered from 10 to 49 d of age, when all lambs were slaughtered. Results showed that the average daily feed intake (ADFI) of starter, average daily gain (ADG), BW of lambs at ages of 5 and 6 wk in SB group were greater (P < 0.05) than those in Con group. Infusion of SB increased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of acetate, butyrate, and total VFA in the rumen fluid and elevated (P < 0.05) the levels of β-hydroxybutyrate  (BHBA), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and insulin in plasma. Infusion of SB promoted rumen papillae growth, depicted by higher emptied rumen weight, larger rumen papillae length, width, and surface area, and greater thickness of stratum corneum and total . Sodium butyrate infusion upregulated (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of cyclin A2, cyclin D1, and cyclin-dependent kinases 6 (CDK6), and downregulated (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of caspase-3 and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) in the rumen epithelia. Moreover, SB infusion also upregulated (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5 (IGFBP-5), and downregulated (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) in the rumen epithelia. Sodium butyrate infusion also enhanced (P < 0.05) gene expressions of monocarboxylate transporter isoform 1 (MCT1), downregulated in adenoma (DRA), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase isoform 2 (HMGCS2), and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (HMGCL), while depressed (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of sodium/proton exchanger isoform 2 (NHE2) in the rumen epithelia. Our results suggest that the SB infusion can improve animal performance, promote the ruminal papillae growth, and enhance expression of genes related to ruminal epithelial VFA uptake and metabolism in preweaning twin lambs. These findings provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of SB promoting rumen epithelial development and function in preweaning lambs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30890187>Species-specific enhancement of enterohemorrhagic E. coli pathogenesis mediated by microbiome metabolites.</a></h1><p>Species-specific differences in tolerance to infection are exemplified by the high susceptibility of humans to enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection, whereas mice are relatively resistant to this pathogen. This intrinsic species-specific difference in EHEC infection limits the translation of murine research to human. Furthermore, studying the mechanisms underlying this differential susceptibility is a difficult problem due to complex in vivo interactions between the host, pathogen, and disparate commensal microbial communities.We utilize organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) microfluidic culture technology to model damage of the human colonic  induced by EHEC infection, and show that epithelial injury is greater when exposed to metabolites derived from the human  microbiome compared to mouse. Using a multi-omics approach, we discovered four human microbiome metabolites-4-methyl benzoic , 3,4-dimethylbenzoic , hexanoic , and heptanoic -that are sufficient to mediate this effect. The active human microbiome metabolites preferentially induce expression of flagellin, a bacterial protein associated with motility of EHEC and increased epithelial injury. Thus, the decreased tolerance to infection observed in humans versus other species may be due in part to the presence of compounds produced by the human intestinal microbiome that actively promote bacterial pathogenicity.Organ-on-chip technology allowed the identification of specific human microbiome metabolites modulating EHEC pathogenesis. These identified metabolites are sufficient to increase susceptibility to EHEC in our human Colon Chip model and they contribute to species-specific tolerance. This work suggests that higher concentrations of these metabolites could be the reason for higher susceptibility to EHEC infection in certain human populations, such as children. Furthermore, this research lays the foundation for therapeutic-modulation of microbe products in order to prevent and treat human bacterial infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30602573>Elafibranor interrupts adipose dysfunction-mediated  and liver injury in mice with alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h1><p> Reversal of alcohol-induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α (PPARα) and PPARδ dysfunction has been reported to decrease the severity of alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH). Autophagy is essential for cell survival and tissue energy homeostasis. Emerging evidence indicates that alcohol-induced adipose tissue (AT) autophagy dysfunction contributes to injury in the intestine, liver, and AT of ASH.  The effects and mechanisms of dual PPARα/δ agonist elafibranor on autophagy stimulation were investigated using mice with ASH.  C57BL/6 mice on ethanol diet showed AT dysfunction, disrupted intestinal barrier, and ASH, which was accompanied by alcohol-mediated decrease in PPARα, PPARδ, and autophagy levels in intestine, liver, and AT. Chronic treatment with elafibranor attenuated AT apoptosis and inflammation by restoration of tissue PPARα, PPARδ, and autophagy levels. In ASH mice, alcohol-induced AT dysfunction along with increased fatty  (FA) uptake and decreased free FA (FFA) release from AT was inhibited by elafibranor. The improvement of AT autophagy dysfunction by elafibranor alleviated inflammation and apoptosis-mediated intestinal epithelial disruption in ASH mice. Acute elafibranor incubation inhibited ethanol-induced ASH-mice-sera-enhanced autophagy dysfunction, apoptosis, barrier disruption, and intracellular steatosis in Caco-2 cells and primary hepatocytes (PHs).  Altogether, these findings demonstrated that the PPARα/δ agonist, elafibranor, decreased the severity of liver injury by restoration of alcohol-suppressed AT autophagy function and by decreasing the release of apoptotic markers, inflammatory cytokines, and FFA, thereby reducing intestinal  disruption and liver inflammation/apoptosis/steatosis in ASH mice. These data suggest that dual PPAR agonists can serve as potential therapeutic agents for the management of ASH.© 2019 The Author(s).

This study investigated the ileal epithelial microbiota and its relationship with host epithelial function in goats fed a HG diet (concentrate/hay, 90:10) and a control diet (concentrate/hay, 55:45), aiming to elucidate the mechanisms involved in ileal adaptation to subacute acidosis. The HG challenge increased the ileal volatile fatty  concentration ( p = 0.030) and altered the ileal epithelial microbiota by increasing (FDR < 0.05) relative abundances of active carbohydrate and protein degraders Synergistetes, Prevotella, Fibrobacter, Clostridium, Treponema, and unclassified Ruminococcaceae by 20.1-, 6.3-, 16.8-, 8.5-, 19.9-, and 7.1-fold, respectively. However, the HG diet tended to reduce (FDR < 0.10) the relative abundance of Candidatus Arthromitus (38.8 ± 36.1 versus 2.1 ± 3.1). Microbial functional potentials inferred using PICRUSt indicated that the HG challenge elevated abundances of pathways associated with metabolism of amino , glycan, cofactors, and vitamins, whereras it decreased pathways associated with signal transduction, xenobiotic biodegradation, and metabolism. Additionally, in the ileal  of HG goats, transcriptome analysis identified the increment (FDR < 0.10) of candidate genes involved in metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, vitamins, and the proinflammatory cytokine pathway, while downregulating genes encoding antimicrobials and complements (FDR < 0.05). Collectively, the HG challenge shifted the structure and functional potentials of the ileal microbial community and affected the host responses in the ileum of goats toward increased metabolic activities of macro- and micronutrients, together with an increased risk of  inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31140746>Modulation of Intestinal Epithelial Glycocalyx Development by Human Milk Oligosaccharides and Non-Digestible Carbohydrates.</a></h1><p>The epithelial glycocalyx development is of great importance for microbial colonization. Human milk oligosaccharides (hMOs) and non-digestible carbohydrates (NDCs) may modulate glycocalyx development.The effects of hMOs and NDCs on human  epithelial cells (Caco2) are investigated by quantifying thickness and area coverage of adsorbed albumin, heparan sulfate (HS), and hyaluronic  (HA) in the glycocalyx. Effects of hMOs (2'-FL and 3-FL) and NDCs [inulins with degrees of polymerization (DP) (DP3-DP10, DP10-DP60, DP30-DP60) and pectins with degrees of methylation (DM) (DM7, DM55, DM69)] are tested using immunofluorescence staining at 1 and 5 days stimulation. HMOs show a significant enhancing effect on glycocalyx development but effects are structure-dependent. 3-FL induces a stronger albumin adsorption and increases HS and HA stronger than 2'-FL. The DP3-DP10, DP30-60 inulins also increase glycocalyx development in a structure-dependent manner as DP3-DP10 selectively increases HS, while DP30-DP60 specifically increases HA. Pectins have less effects, and only increase albumin adsorption.Here, it is shown that 2'-FL and 3-FL and inulins stimulate glycocalyx development in a structure-dependent fashion.

Butyrate, propionate and acetate, which are collectively called short-chain fatty  (SCFAs), are generated by fermentation of dietary fibers by  microbiota. Evidences indicate that SCFAs are key players in regulating beneficial effect of dietary fibers and  microbiota on our health. SCFAs interact with metabolite-sensing G protein-coupled receptors GPR41, GPR43 and GPR109A expressed in   and immune cells. These interactions induce mechanisms that play a key role in maintaining homeostasis in  and other organs. This review summarizes the protective roles of GPR41, GPR43 and GPR109A in dietary fibers-,  microbiota- and SCFAs-mediated suppression of inflammation and carcinogenesis in  and other organs.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In lyophilized plant cells, PDs are stable at ambient temperature for several years, maintaining their folding and efficacy. Upon oral delivery, PDs bioencapsulated in plant cells are protected in the stomach from  and enzymes but are subsequently released into the  lumen by microbes that digest the plant cell wall. The large mucosal area of the human intestine offers an ideal system for oral drug delivery. When tags (receptor-binding proteins or cell-penetrating peptides) are fused to PDs, they efficiently cross the intestinal  and are delivered to the circulatory or immune system. Unique tags to deliver PDs to human immune or nonimmune cells have been developed recently. After crossing the , ubiquitous proteases cleave off tags at engineered sites. PDs are also delivered to the brain or retina by crossing the blood-brain or retinal barriers. This review highlights recent advances in PD delivery to treat Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, hypertension, Gaucher's or ocular diseases, as well as the development of affordable drugs by eliminating prohibitively expensive purification, cold chain and sterile delivery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31079312>Targeting  microbiota as a possible therapy for mastitis.</a></h1><p>Mastitis, a disease that affects both dairy herds and humans, is recognized as the most common source of losses in the dairy industry. Antibiotics have been used for years as the primary treatment for mastitis. However, abuse of antibiotics has led to the emergence of resistant strains and the presence of drug residues and has increased the difficulty of curing this disease. In addition, antibiotics kill most of the microbes that are present in the digestive tract, leading to imbalances in the  microbiome and destruction of the ecosystem that is normally present in the .  microbiota play an important role in the host's health and could be considered the "second brain" of the body. In recent years, the  microbiota and their metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty  (SCFAs), have been shown to participate in the development of mastitis. LPS is the main component of the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria. Overproduction of rumen-derived LPS injures the rumen , resulting in the entry of LPS into the blood and damaged liver function; once in the blood, it circulates into the mammary gland, increasing blood-barrier permeability and leading to mammary gland inflammation. SCFAs, which are produced by  microbiota as fermentation products, have a protective effect on mammary gland inflammatory responses and help maintain the function of the blood-milk barrier. Recently, increasing attention has been focused on the use of probiotics as a promising alternative for the treatment of mastitis. This review summarizes the effects of the  microbiome and its metabolites on mastitis as well as the current of probiotics in mastitis. This work may provide a valuable theoretical foundation for the development of fresh ideas for the prevention and treatment of mastitis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663129>Microbiota-dependent and -independent effects of dietary fiber on human health.</a></h1><p>Dietary fiber, such as indigestible oligo- and polysaccharides, occurs in many foods and has gained considerable interest related to its beneficial effects on host health and specific diseases. Dietary fiber is neither digested nor absorbed in the small intestine and modulates the composition of the  microbiota. New evidence indicates that dietary fiber also directly interacts with the  and immune cells throughout the gastrointestinal tract by microbiota-independent effects. This review provides a focused overview of how dietary fiber improve human health and how these reported health benefits are connected to molecular pathways, in (1) a microbiota-independent manner, via interaction with specific surface receptors on epithelial and immune cells regulating intestinal barrier and immune function, (2) a microbiota-dependent manner via maintaining intestinal homeostasis by promoting beneficial microbes, including Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, limiting the growth, adhesion and cytotoxicity of pathogenic microbes, as well as stimulating fiber-derived microbial short-chain fatty  production.This article is protected by copyright.

The importance of lysophosphatidic  (LPA) and its receptors in the  has been progressively appreciated. LPA signaling modulates cell proliferation, invasion, adhesion, angiogenesis, and survival that can promote cancer growth and metastasis. These effects are equally important for the maintenance of the epithelial barrier in the , which forms the first line of defense against the milieu of potentially pathogenic stimuli. This review focuses on the LPA-mediated signaling that potentially contributes to inflammation and tumor formation in the gastrointestinal tract.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30565622>DHA-phospholipids (DHA-PL) and EPA-phospholipids (EPA-PL) prevent intestinal dysfunction induced by chronic stress.</a></h1><p>Stress exposure can increase the appearance of intestinal dysfunction. DHA and EPA have been shown to possess significant anti-inflammatory and immuno-enhancement bioactivities. The aim of the study was to investigate whether different forms of DHA or EPA would affect intestinal barriers (including intestinal  integrity and immunity responses,  microbiota and its metabolites) in mice under chronic stress, and might therefore prevent stress induced intestinal dysfunction. Chronic stress caused a series of anomalies in the intestine, including decreased faecal water content, increased pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6), reduced expression levels of ZO-1, occludin and E-cadherin, and aberrant microbiota composition (especially Roseburia spp., Prevotella spp., bifidobacteria and lactobacilli) and its metabolites, mainly LPS, acetic , propionic  and butyric . Our data indicated that both DHA-PL and EPA-PL counteracted these adverse effects effectively. In conclusion, DHA-PL and EPA-PL may effectively protect mice against intestinal dysfunction under chronic stress exposure as potential ingredients for functional food.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28386635>VASA expression suggests shared germ line dynamics in bivalve molluscs.</a></h1><p>Germ line segregation can occur during embryogenesis or after embryogenesis completion, with multipotent cells able to give rise to both germ and somatic cells in the developing juvenile or even in adulthood. These undifferentiated cells, in some animals, are self-renewing stem cells. In all these cell lineages, the same set of genes, among which vasa, appears to be expressed. We traced VASA expression during the peculiar gonad rebuilding of bivalves to verify its presence from undifferentiated germ cells to mature gametes in an animal taxon in which the mechanism of germ line establishment is still under investigation. We utilized antibodies produced against VASPH, VASA homolog of Ruditapes philippinarum (Subclass Heterodonta), to compare the known expression pattern of R. philippinarum to two species of the Subclass Pteriomorphia, Anadara kagoshimensis and Crassostrea gigas, and another species of the Subclass Heterodonta, Mya arenaria. The immunohistological data obtained support a conserved mechanism of proliferation of "primordial stem cells" among the simple columnar  of the , as well as in the connective tissue, contributing to the seasonal gonad reconstitution. Given the taxonomic separation of the analyzed species, we suggest that the process could be shared in bivalve molluscs. The presence of germ cell precursors in the   appears to be a feature in common with model organisms, such as mouse, fruit fly, and human. Thus, the comparative study of germ line establishment can add details on bivalve development, but can also help to clarify the role that VASA plays during germ cell specification.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29137145>Dietary Pea Fiber Supplementation Improves Glycemia and Induces Changes in the Composition of  Microbiota, Serum Short Chain Fatty  Profile and Expression of Mucins in Glucose Intolerant Rats.</a></h1><p>Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial impact of dried peas and their components on glucose tolerance; however, the role of  microbiota as a potential mediator is not fully examined. In this study, we investigated the effect of dietary supplementation with raw and cooked pea seed coats (PSC) on glucose tolerance, microbial composition of the , select markers of intestinal barrier function, and short chain fatty  profile in glucose intolerant rats. Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed high fat diet (HFD) for six weeks to induce glucose intolerance, followed by four weeks of feeding PSC-supplemented diets. Cooked PSC improved glucose tolerance by approximately 30% ( < 0.05), and raw and cooked PSC diets reduced insulin response by 53% and 56% respectively ( < 0.05 and  < 0.01), compared to HFD (containing cellulose as the source of dietary fiber). 16S rRNA gene sequencing on fecal samples showed a significant shift in the overall microbial composition of PSC groups when compared to HFD and low fat diet (LFD) controls. At the family level, PSC increased the abundance of  and  ( < 0.001), and decreased  ( < 0.01) compared with HFD. This was accompanied by increased mRNA expression of mucin genes Muc1, Muc2, and Muc4 in ileal  ( < 0.05). Serum levels of acetate and propionate increased with raw PSC diet ( < 0.01). These results indicate that supplementation of HFD with PSC fractions can improve glycemia and may have a protective role against HFD-induced alterations in  microbiota and mucus layer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28535698>Effect of urolithins on oxidative stress of colorectal adenocarcinomacells-Caco-2.</a></h1><p>Urolithins (UROs) are metabolites derived from ellagic  (EA) and ellagitannins (ETs) by  microbiota after consumption of different ETs. The health effects attributed to UROs are numerous and diverse, ranging from antimalarial properties to anticancer activities and regulation of gene expression. The aim of this work was at assessing the effect of URO-A; -B; -C; -D on the oxidative status of colon  using as a model colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco-2). No significant cytotoxic effects of UROs was noted, with the applied treatments. Supplementation of cell growth medium with a mixture of UROs decreased the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species both after short- and long-term exposure. UROs also affected the activity of antioxidative enzymes within the cell, especially catalase.At concentrations reached in the lumen of the , UROs can exert beneficial effects on the cells by decreasing oxidative stress thus preventing the damage caused by reactive oxygen species.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29462370>The effect of Eimeria maxima infection on the expression of amino  and sugar transporters aminopeptidase, as well as the di- and tri-peptide transporter PepT1, is not solely due to decreased feed intake.</a></h1><p>Coccidiosis caused by Eimeria in poultry is endemic to poultry operations and results in decreased feed intake, diarrhea, and decreased weight gain. The goal was to determine the effect of Eimeria maxima infection on the expression of genes that encode peptide and amino  transporters (AATs), and also to determine whether decreased feed intake contributes to the change in gene expression by including a pair-fed group of broilers. Three groups of male Ross broilers: 1) not infected, 2) infected, and 3) not infected pair-fed groups were used. Chicks were infected with 1,000 oocysts of E. maxima at 21 d of age. Feed consumption was obtained daily, and at d 0, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 post-infection (PI), 6 birds were euthanized, and a portion of the jejunum was removed for qRT-PCR. Infected birds had significantly decreased feed consumption between d 6 to 9 PI. At d 7 PI infected birds had a 45% reduction in weight gain, and pair-fed birds had a 32% reduction in weight gain. The feed conversion ratio at d 7 PI of infected birds was 2.2 while that of pair-fed birds was 1.7, compared to 1.5 in uninfected birds. Growth parameters were more affected in infected birds than in pair-fed birds. By measuring expression levels of nutrient uptake and processing genes via qRT-PCR, it was determined that genes encoding proteins located at the brush border of the   were affected by infection as well as change in feed intake. The expression of AATs B°AT, b°,+AT, EAAT3, and PepT1 in infected birds decreased sharply at the height of infection; however, in birds that were pair fed, an increase in expression of b°,+AT, and PepT1 was observed, and little change was seen in expression of B°AT and EAAT3. In summary, the changes in expression of digestive enzymes and nutrient transporters are distinct between coccidia-infected birds compared to healthy pair-fed birds.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30624759>Expression of amino  and sugar transporters, aminopeptidase, and the di- and tri-peptide transporter PepT1; differences between modern fast growing broilers and broilers not selected for rapid growth.</a></h1><p>Within the last 60 yr genetics of broilers have changed to produce rapid growing birds that achieve market weight in 6 wk or less. To investigate the differences in factors that play a role in nutrient processing and uptake between modern fast growing (Ross) and slow growing broilers not selected for growth (ACRBC), a study was carried comparing the expression of 13 genes that encode amino  transporters (ASCT1, ATBo,+, BoAT, bo, +AT, CAT1, CAT2, EAAT3, γ+LAT1, and LAT1) and sugar transporters (GLUT2 and GLUT5), as well as aminopeptidase (APN) and the di- and tri-peptide transporter PepT1. The growth rate of Ross birds was approximately 4 times greater than that of ACRBCs, and the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was greater in ACRBCs at all-time points measured. Gene expression in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum was measured at 1, 3, 5, 10, and 14 d post hatch (PH). The expression of genes that encode proteins (particularly ASCT1, ATBo, +, and BoAT) located at the brush border of the   was generally higher in ACRBCs especially at earlier time points. The expression of genes that encode proteins located at the basolateral surface of the   was less affected. The expression of GLUT2 and GLUT5 was significantly decreased in ACRBCs at most time points and  segments. Based on the present data we conclude that expression of brush border and sugar transporters in the small intestine can be correlated with growth. Presented increases the identification of the factors that influence growth and will assist future studies of the function of these molecules.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Poultry Science Association 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27364593>Paraoxonase 2 modulates a proapoptotic function in LS174T cells in response to quorum sensing molecule N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone.</a></h1><p>A mucus layer coats the gastrointestinal tract and serves as the first line of intestinal defense against infection. N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum-sensing molecules produced by gram-negative bacteria in the  can influence the homeostasis of intestinal . In this study, we investigated the effects of two representative long- and short-chain AHLs, N-3-(oxododecanoyl)-homoserine lactone (C12-HSL) and N-butyryl homoserine lactone (C4-HSL), on cell viability and mucus secretion in LS174T cells. C12-HSL but not C4-HSL significantly decreased cell viability by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and activating cell apoptosis which led to a decrease in mucin expression. Pretreatment with lipid raft disruptor (Methyl-β-cyclodextrin, MβCD) and oxidative stress inhibitor (N-acetyl-L-cysteine, NAC) slightly rescued the viability of cells damaged by C12-HSL exposure, while the paraoxonase 2 (PON2) inhibitor (Triazolo[4,3-a]quinolone, TQ416) significantly affected recovering cells viability and mucin secretion. When LS174T cells were treated with C12-HSL and TQ416 simultaneously, TQ416 showed the maximal positive effect on cells viability. However, if cells were first treated with C12-HSL for 40 mins, and then TQ46 was added, the TQ416 had no effect on cell viability. These results suggest that the C12-HSL- process acts at an early step to activate apoptosis as part of C12-HSL's effect on intestinal mucus barrier function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29803110>Effects of chronic dexamethasone exposure on bile  metabolism and cecal epithelia function in goats.</a></h1><p>Bile  (BAs) are synthesized in the liver via the oxidation of cholesterol and further metabolized by microbiota in the , where they simultaneously impact  function. In the present study, 10 goats were randomly divided into 2 groups; 1 group was injected with dexamethasone (Dex; 0.2 mg/kg), and the other group was injected with saline as the control (Con) for 21 d. Expression levels of key genes and proteins in the liver and  mucosa were analyzed and compared to investigate the impact of chronic stress on BA metabolism and related functions in ruminants. The results revealed that Dex decreased plasma total BAs (TBAs) concentration (P < 0.05) but increased TBA concentration in the cecal digesta (P < 0.05). Total cholesterol in the liver decreased moderately in response to Dex. The protein expression of cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 and cytochrome P450 family 27 subfamily A member 1, 2 enzymes that control BA synthesis in the liver, remained unchanged by Dex administration (P > 0.05). The expression of several genes in the cecal mucosa encoding epithelial tight junction proteins, including occludin (P < 0.05), tight junction protein 1 (P < 0.01), and claudin 1 (P < 0.05), increased significantly in response to Dex, and expression of defensin beta 1, which can strengthen the innate immune system, was also upregulated (P < 0.05). In addition, BAs increased the expression of the Solute Carrier family 9 member A 2 (P < 0.01) that encodes a sodium hydrogen exchanger. These results suggest that the Dex-induced disruption of BA homeostasis might be mediated through a liver-independent pathway in goats, and the Dex-induced accumulation of TBAs in the cecal digesta may improve volatile fatty  transportation and mucosal defense.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, the role of ECSIT in invertebrates remains largely unexplored. We performed comparative investigations of the expression, gene structure, and phylogeny of ECSIT, Toll-like receptor (TLR), and Smad4 in the cephalochordate Branchiostoma belcheri. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that, in amphioxus, ECSIT, TLR, and Smad4 form independent clusters at the base of Chordate   clusters. Interestingly, overall gene structures were comparable to those in vertebrate orthologs. Transcripts of AmphiECSIT were detectable at the mid-neural stage, and continued to be expressed in the  of the pharyngeal region at later stages. In adult animals, strong expression was observed in the nerve cord, endostyle, epithelial cells of the  and wheel organ, genital membrane of the testis, and coelom and lymphoid cavities, what is highly similar to AmphiTLR and AmphiSmad4 expression patterns during development and in adult organisms. Our data suggests that ECSIT is evolutionarily conserved. Its amphioxus ortholog functions during embryonic development and as part of the innate immune system and may be involved in TLR/BMP signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28721250>Arabinoxylans, inulin and  1063 repress the adherent-invasive  from mucus in a mucosa-comprising  model.</a></h1><p>The microbiota that colonises the intestinal mucus may particularly affect human health given its proximity to the . For instance, the presence of the adherent-invasive  (AIEC) in this mucosal microbiota has been correlated with Crohn's disease. Using short-term screening assays and a novel long-term dynamic  model, which comprises a simulated mucosal environment (M-SHIME), we investigated how (potential) pro- and prebiotics may repress colonisation of AIEC from mucus. Despite that during the short-term screening assays, some of the investigated  strains adhered strongly to mucins, none of them competed with AIEC for mucin-adhesion. In contrast, AIEC survival and growth during co-culture batch incubations was decreased by  GG and  1063, which correlated with (undissociated) lactic  and reuterin levels. Regarding the prebiotics, long-chain arabinoxylans (LC-AX) lowered the initial mucin-adhesion of AIEC, while both inulin (IN) and galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) limited AIEC survival and growth during batch incubations.  1063, LC-AX and IN were thus retained for a long-term study with the M-SHIME. All treatments repressed AIEC from mucus without affecting AIEC numbers in the luminal content. As a possible explanation,  1063 treatment increased lactobacilli levels in mucus, while LC-AX and IN additionally increased mucosal bifidobacteria levels, thus leading to antimicrobial effects against AIEC in mucus. Overall, this study shows that pro- and prebiotics can beneficially modulate the  mucosal microbiota, thus limiting occurrence of opportunistic pathogens among those mucosal microbes which may directly interact with the host given their proximity to the .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25751005>Metabolic phenotyping of an adoptive transfer mouse model of experimental colitis and impact of dietary fish oil intake.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases are acute and chronic disabling inflammatory disorders with multiple complex etiologies that are not well-defined. Chronic intestinal inflammation has been linked to an energy-deficient state of   with alterations in oxidative metabolism. Plasma-, urine-, stool-, and liver-specific metabonomic analyses are reported in a naïve T cell adoptive transfer (AT) experimental model of colitis, which evaluated the impact of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA)-enriched diet. Metabolic profiles of AT animals and their controls under chow diet or fish oil supplementation were compared to describe the (i) consequences of inflammatory processes and (ii) the differential impact of n-3 fatty . Inflammation was associated with higher glycoprotein levels (related to acute-phase response) and remodeling of PUFAs. Low triglyceride levels and enhanced PUFA levels in the liver suggest activation of lipolytic pathways that could lead to the observed increase of phospholipids in the liver (including plasmalogens and sphingomyelins). In parallel, the increase in stool excretion of most amino  may indicate a protein-losing enteropathy. Fecal content of glutamine was lower in AT mice, a feature exacerbated under fish oil intervention that may reflect a functional relationship between intestinal inflammatory status and glutamine metabolism. The decrease in Krebs cycle intermediates in urine (succinate, α-ketoglutarate) also suggests a reduction in the glutaminolytic pathway at a systemic level. Our data indicate that inflammatory status is related to this overall loss of energy homeostasis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26225425>All-Trans Retinoic  Induces TGF-β2 in Intestinal Epithelial Cells via RhoA- and p38α MAPK-Mediated Activation of the Transcription Factor ATF2.</a></h1><p>We have shown previously that preterm infants are at risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), an inflammatory bowel necrosis typically seen in infants born prior to 32 weeks' gestation, because of the developmental deficiency of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β2 in the intestine. The present study was designed to investigate all-trans retinoic  (atRA) as an inducer of TGF-β2 in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and to elucidate the involved signaling mechanisms.AtRA effects on intestinal  were investigated using IEC6 cells. TGF-β2 expression was measured using reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blots. Signaling pathways were investigated using Western blots, transiently-transfected/transduced cells, kinase arrays, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and selective small molecule inhibitors.AtRA-treatment of IEC6 cells selectively increased TGF-β2 mRNA and protein expression in a time- and dose-dependent fashion, and increased the activity of the TGF-β2 promoter. AtRA effects were mediated via RhoA GTPase, Rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1), p38α MAPK, and activating transcription factor (ATF)-2. AtRA increased phospho-ATF2 binding to the TGF-β2 promoter and increased histone H2B acetylation in the TGF-β2 nucleosome, which is typically associated with transcriptional activation.AtRA induces TGF-β2 expression in IECs via RhoA- and p38α MAPK-mediated activation of the transcription factor ATF2. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of atRA as a protective/therapeutic agent in  mucosal inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30670323>Comparative biocontrol ability of chitinases from bacteria and recombinant chitinases from the thermophilic fungus Thermomyces lanuginosus.</a></h1><p>Microbial chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) are known to hydrolyse the chitinous   of insects and cell walls of many fungi. In this study, seven chitinases from different bacteria and fungi were produced, characterized and their biocontrol abilities against graminaceous stem borers Eldana saccharina, Chilo partellus and Sesamia calamistis were assessed. All chitinases were stable over broad ranges of pH and temperature, however, recombinant fungal chitinases were more -stable than the bacterial counterparts. Chitinases from the thermophilic filamentous fungi Thermomyces lanuginosus SSBP (Chit1) and from Bacillus licheniformis (Chit lic) caused 70% and 80% mortality, respectively, in second instar larvae of E. saccharina. Six of the seven partially-purified microbial chitinases inhibited Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, A. alliaceus, A. ochraceus, Fusarium verticillioides and Mucor sp.

Leaf extract was obtained using 0.15 M NaCl and evaluated for phytochemical composition and lectin activity. Early L4 larvae were incubated with the extract (0.3-1.35%, w/v) for 8 days, in presence or absence of food. Polymeric proanthocyanidins, hydrolysable tannins, heterosid and aglycone flavonoids, cinnamic  derivatives, traces of steroids, and lectin activity were detected in the extract, which killed the larvae at an LC50 of 0.62% (unfed larvae) and 1.03% (fed larvae). Further, the larvae incubated with the extract reacted by eliminating the  content. No larvae reached the pupal stage in treatments at concentrations between 0.5% and 1.35%, while in the control (fed larvae), 61.7% of individuals emerged as adults. The extract (1.0%) promoted intense disorganization of larval midgut , including deformation and hypertrophy of cells, disruption of microvilli, and vacuolization of cytoplasms, affecting digestive, enteroendocrine, regenerative, and proliferating cells. In addition, cells with fragmented DNA were observed. Separation of extract components by solid phase extraction revealed that cinnamic  derivatives and flavonoids are involved in larvicidal effect of the extract, being the first most efficient in a short time after larvae treatment. The lectin present in the extract was isolated, but did not show deleterious effects on larvae. The extract and cinnamic  derivatives were toxic to A. salina nauplii, while the flavonoids showed low toxicity. S. terebinthifolius leaf extract caused damage to the midgut of A. aegypti larvae, interfering with survival and development. The larvicidal effect of the extract can be attributed to cinnamic  derivatives and flavonoids. The data obtained using A. salina indicates that caution should be used when employing this extract as a larvicidal agent.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31211831>Intestinal Inflammation Modulates the Epithelial Response to Butyrate in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h1><p>Butyrate-producing gut bacteria are reduced in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), supporting the hypothesis that butyrate supplementation may be beneficial in this setting. Nonetheless, earlier studies suggest that the oxidation of butyrate in IBD patients is altered. We propose that inflammation may decrease epithelial butyrate consumption.Non-IBD controls and IBD patients were recruited for the study. Stool samples were used for short-chain fatty  and bacterial butyryl CoA:acetate CoA-transferase quantification. Colonic biopsies and ex vivo differentiated epithelial organoids (d-EpOCs) treated with butyrate and/or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) were used for analyzing the expression of transporters MCT1 and ABCG2, metabolic enzyme ACADS, and butyrate receptor GPR43, and for butyrate metabolism and consumption assays.We observed that lower stool content of butyrate-producing bacteria in active IBD patients did not correlate with decreased butyrate concentrations. Indeed, the intestinal epithelial expression of MCT1, ABCG2, ACADS, and GPR43 was altered in active IBD patients. Nonetheless, d-EpOCs derived from IBD patients showed SLC16A1 (gene encoding for MCT1 protein), ABCG2, ACADS, and GPR43 expression levels comparable to controls. Moreover, IBD- and non-IBD-derived d-EpOCs responded similarly to butyrate, as assessed by transcriptional regulation. TNFα significantly altered SLC16A1, ABCG2, and GPR43 transcription in d-EpOCs, mimicking the expression profile observed in biopsies from active IBD patients and resulting in reduced butyrate consumption.We provide evidence that the response to butyrate is not intrinsically altered in IBD patients. However, TNFα renders the epithelium less responsive to this metabolite, defeating the purpose of butyrate supplementation during active inflammation.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

A large number of research data on Lactobacillus GG is the basis for the use of this probiotic for human health. In this review we have considered predominantly randomized controlled trials, meta-analysis, Cochrane Review, guide lines of Scientific Societies and anyway studies whose results were evaluated by means of relative risk, odds ratio, weighted mean difference 95% confidence interval.

Such interactions are concentrated at the colonic mucosa and provide energy for the host  through the production of the short-chain fatty  butyrate. We sought to determine the role of epithelial butyrate metabolism in establishing the austere oxygenation profile of the distal . Bacteria-derived butyrate affects epithelial O2 consumption and results in stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), a transcription factor coordinating barrier protection. Antibiotic-mediated depletion of the microbiota reduces colonic butyrate and HIF expression, both of which are restored by butyrate supplementation. Additionally, germ-free mice exhibit diminished retention of O2-sensitive dyes and decreased stabilized HIF. Furthermore, the influences of butyrate are lost in cells lacking HIF, thus linking butyrate metabolism to stabilized HIF and barrier function. This work highlights a mechanism where host-microbe interactions augment barrier function in the distal .Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, increasing evidences support the idea that defects in pro-resolving pathways might strongly contribute to IBD onset. The resolution of inflammation is now recognized as a dynamic event coordinated by specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (LMs), which dampen inflammation-sustaining events, such as angiogenesis, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, clearance of apoptotic cells, and microorganisms. Among these pro-resolving molecules, those derived from essential polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFAs) have been shown to induce favorable effects on a plethora of human inflammatory disorders, including IBD. Here, we offer a summary of mechanisms involving both cellular and molecular components of the immune response and underlying the anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving properties of PUFAs and their derivatives in the , focusing on both ω-3 and ω-6 LMs. These fatty  may influence IBD progression by: reducing neutrophil transmigration across the intestinal vasculature and the , preventing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the up-regulation of adhesion molecules, and finally by promoting the production of other pro-resolving molecules. We also discuss the numerous attempts in using pro-resolving PUFAs to ameliorate intestinal inflammation, both in patients with IBD and mouse models. Although their effects in reducing inflammation is incontestable, results from previous works describing the effects of PUFA administration to prevent or treat IBD are controversial. Therefore, more efforts are needed not only to identify and explain the physiological functions of PUFAs in the , but also to unveil novel biosynthetic pathways of these pro-resolving LMs that may be dysregulated in these -related disorders. We suppose that either PUFAs or new medications specifically promoting resolution-regulating mediators and pathways will be much better tolerated by patients with IBD, with the advantage of avoiding immune suppression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29111180>Effects of kestose on  mucosal immunity in an atopic dermatitis mouse model.</a></h1><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is recently increasing among populations, but the underlying mechanisms remain controversial. Interactions between the  microbiota and mucosal immunity are considered to be a crucial etiology. Fructooligosaccharide (FOS), prebiotics have been reported as activators of the  microbiota.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of kestose, the smallest FOS and FOS on atopic dermatitis in mice.An AD mouse model was developed by (ovalbumin) epidermal sensitization using BALB/c mice. Kestose (1%, 5%, and 10%) or FOS (5%, positive control) was orally administered throughout the study.In comparison with the values observed for the control AD mice, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), clinical score, and skin inflammation on histopathology were significantly decreased by the oral administration of kestose. Total IgE, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in skin, and IL-4 were also suppressed by this administration. In addition, the population of CD4Foxp3 cells in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and acetate concentrations in feces were significantly increased by kestose treatment.These findings suggest that kestose activates the  immune system to induce the tolerance against allergic skin inflammations in AD.Copyright © 2017 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

Reference genomes from the Human Microbiome Project and the KEGG Orthology database were used for metagenome analyses. Short-chain fatty  in fecal samples were compared by using gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analyses.We show that enrichment of a subspecies of the major  species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is strongly associated with AD. In addition, the AD microbiome was enriched in genes encoding the use of various nutrients that could be released from damaged  , reflecting a bloom of auxotrophic bacteria. Fecal samples from patients with AD showed decreased levels of butyrate and propionate, which have anti-inflammatory effects. This is likely a consequence of an intraspecies compositional change in F prausnitzii that reduces the number of high butyrate and propionate producers, including those related to the strain A2-165, a lack of which has been implicated in patients with Crohn disease.The data suggest that feedback interactions between dysbiosis in F prausnitzii and dysregulation of  epithelial inflammation might underlie the chronic progression of AD by resulting in impairment of the  epithelial barrier, which ultimately leads to aberrant TH2-type immune responses to allergens in the skin.Copyright © 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

In this study, we examined the role of pioglitazone, an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, in  barrier failure during experimental peritonitis in rats.Male rats were randomly divided into three groups as follows: sham, sepsis, and sepsis + pioglitazone. Sepsis was achieved by means of the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Pioglitazone was administered intraperitoneally (10 mg/kg/d) for 7 d before the experiment. Animals were killed at 24 h or followed 72 h for survival. The tissue level of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, and myeloperoxidase was measured. Intestinal mucosa injury was assessed histologically. The plasma fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran, D-lactic , and intestinal diamine oxidase were determined to evaluate the permeability and integrity of intestinal mucosal . Vena cava blood and tissue samples were used to monitor bacterial translocation.Intestinal inflammation, oxidize stress, neutrophil infiltration, morphology injury, and impaired permeability of the small intestine in the CLP group were found more severe than those in the sham group. Application of pioglitazone not only minimized all the indicators of intestinal injury and barrier failure but also improved the survival of septic rats induced by CLP.Our novel findings suggest that pioglitazone could protect against intestinal injury and maintain intestinal barrier integrity and might be a useful strategy to ameliorate intestinal failure in polymicrobial sepsis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Relevant elements of the microbiome within both niches include the importance of the early life window for microbiome establishment, the diversity of bacteria, richness of bacteria, and effect of those bacteria on the local  and immune system. Mechanisms of protection include direct anti-inflammatory action or induction of non-type 2 inflammation by certain bacterial colonies.

This chemotherapy-induced mucositis (CIM) is a serious side effect of cytotoxic drugs, and several animal models of CIM have been developed, mainly in rodents and piglets, to help understand the progression of CIM and how to prevent it. Animal models allow highly controlled experimental conditions, detailed organ (e.g., GIT) insights, standardized, clinically relevant treatment regimens, and discovery of new biomarkers. Still, surprisingly few results from animal models have been translated into clinical CIM management and treatments. The results obtained from specific animal models can be difficult to translate to the diverse range of CIM manifestations in patients, which vary according to the antineoplastic drugs, dose, underlying (cancer) disease, and patient characteristics (e.g., age, genetics, and body constitution). Another factor that hinders the direct use of results from animals is inadequate collaboration between basic science and clinical science in relation to CIM. Here, we briefly describe CIM pathophysiology, particularly the basic knowledge that has been obtained from CIM animal models. These model studies have indicated potential new preventive and ameliorating interventions, including supplementation with natural bioactive diets (e.g., milk fractions, colostrum, and plant extracts), nutrients (e.g., polyunsaturated fatty , short-chain fatty , and glutamine), and growth factor peptides (e.g., transforming growth factor and glucagon-like peptide-2), as well as manipulations of the  microbiota (e.g., prebiotics, probiotics, and antibiotics). Rodent CIM models allow well-controlled, in-depth studies of animals with or without tumors while pig models more easily make clinically relevant treatment regimens possible. In synergy, animal models of CIM provide the basic physiological understanding and the new ideas for treatment that are required to make competent decisions in clinical practice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30558589>Qualitative modelling of the interplay of inflammatory status and butyrate in the human : a hypotheses about robust bi-stability.</a></h1><p> microbiota interacts with the human  in multiple ways. Microbiota composition is altered in inflamed  conditions. Likewise, certain microbial fermentation products as well as the lipopolysaccharides of the outer membrane are examples of microbial products with opposing influences on   inflammation status. This system of intricate interactions is known to play a core role in human  inflammatory diseases. Here, we present and analyse a simplified model of bidirectional interaction between the microbiota and the host: in focus is butyrate as an example for a bacterial fermentation product with anti-inflammatory properties.We build a dynamical model based on an existing model of inflammatory regulation in  epithelial cells. Our model introduces both butyrate as a bacterial product which counteracts inflammation, as well as bacterial LPS as a pro-inflammatory bacterial product. Moreover, we propose an extension of this model that also includes a feedback interaction towards bacterial composition. The analysis of these dynamical models shows robust bi-stability driven by butyrate concentrations in the . The extended model hints towards a further possible enforcement of the observed bi-stability via alteration of  bacterial composition. A theoretical perspective on the stability of the described switch-like character is discussed.Interpreting the results of this qualitative model allows formulating hypotheses about the switch-like character of inflammatory regulation in the  , involving bacterial products as constitutive parts of the system. We also speculate about possible explanations for observed bimodal distributions in bacterial compositions in the human . The switch-like behaviour of the system proved to be mostly independent of parameter choices. Further implications of the qualitative character of our modeling approach for the robustness of the proposed hypotheses are discussed, as well as the pronounced role of butyrate compared to other inflammatory regulators, especially LPS, NF- κB and cytokines.</p></html>
