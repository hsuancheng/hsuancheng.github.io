Samplings were performed after 4 weeks (blood and liver). Bodyweight of T-2-fed group was lower after 4 weeks; the liver weight was increased dramatically (threefold of control). Liver total phospholipids (PLs) provided slight alterations in the fatty acid (FA) composition; all three toxin-treated groups showed a decrease in palmitoleic acid (:1 n7) proportion. In the liver mitochondrial PL FA composition, margaric acid (C17:0) proportion decreased in the separated toxin treatments compared to the combined setting. Oleic acid (C18:1 n9) proportion was increased and arachidonic acid (C20:4 n6) was decreased in the FB-treated group, while docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5 n3) was decreased in the separated treatments. The total monounsaturation was significantly higher in the FB group's mitochondrial PL FA profile. After 4 weeks, all toxin treatments decreased the blood plasma reduced glutathione and glutathione peroxidase activity, and FB increased the plasma /sphingosine ratio. Both mycotoxins seem to cross the hepatocellular and the hepatic mitochondrial membrane, without drastic membrane disruption, as assessed from the PL FA composition, but inducing detectable lipid peroxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29632826>Palmitoyl-ceramide accumulation with necrotic cell death in A549 cells, followed by a steep increase in  content.</a></h2><p>Ceramides (Cers) have recently been identified as key signaling molecules that mediate biological functions such as cell growth, differentiation, senescence, apoptosis, and autophagy. However, the functions of Cer accumulation in necrotic cell death remain unknown. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between Cer accumulation with inhibition of the conversion pathway of Cer and concomitant necrotic cell death. In order to minimize the effect of apoptosis against necrotic cell death, A549 cells having the inhibiting effect of caspase 9 by survivin were used in this study. Consequently, Cer accumulation in A549 cells would likely be associated with a pathway other than the mitochondrial caspase-dependent pathway of apoptosis. Here, we showed that the dual addition of a glucosyl-Cer synthase inhibitor and a ceramidase inhibitor to A549 cell culture induced palmitoyl-Cer accumulation with Cer synthase 5 expression and necrotic cell death with lysosomal rupture together with leakage of cathepsin B/alkalization after 2-3 h, although it is unknown in this study whether the necrotic cell death was caused by the lysosomal rupture. This Cer accumulation was followed by a steep increase in  base levels via the activation of serine palmitoyltransferase activity brought about by the increase in palmitoyl-coenzyme A concentration as a substrate after 5-6 h. The increase in palmitoyl-coenzyme A concentration was achieved by activation of the fatty acid synthetic pathway from acetyl coenzyme A.</p></html>
