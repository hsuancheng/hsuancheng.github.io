<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27007679>Medroxyprogesterone acetate and  increase genital mucosal permeability and enhance susceptibility to genital herpes simplex virus type 2 infection.</a></h2><p>Depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) is a hormonal contraceptive especially popular in areas with high prevalence of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI). Although observational studies identify DMPA as an important STI risk factor, mechanisms underlying this connection are undefined.  (LNG) is another progestin used for hormonal contraception, but its effect on STI susceptibility is much less explored. Using a mouse model of genital herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection, we herein found that DMPA and LNG similarly reduced genital expression of the desmosomal cadherin desmoglein-1α (DSG1α), enhanced access of inflammatory cells to genital tissue by increasing mucosal epithelial permeability, and increased susceptibility to viral infection. Additional studies with uninfected mice revealed that DMPA-mediated increases in mucosal permeability promoted tissue inflammation by facilitating endogenous vaginal  invasion. Conversely, concomitant treatment of mice with DMPA and intravaginal estrogen restored mucosal barrier function and prevented HSV-2 infection. Evaluating ectocervical biopsy tissue from women before and 1 month after initiating DMPA remarkably revealed that inflammation and barrier protection were altered by treatment identically to changes seen in progestin-treated mice. Together, our work reveals DMPA and LNG diminish the genital mucosal barrier; a first-line defense against all STI, but may offer foundation for new contraceptive strategies less compromising of barrier protection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26908839>Gonadotropin suppression in men leads to a reduction in claudin-11 at the Sertoli cell tight junction.</a></h2><p>Are Sertoli cell tight junctions (TJs) disrupted in men undergoing hormonal contraception?Localization of the key Sertoli cell TJ protein, claudin-11, was markedly disrupted by 8 weeks of gonadotropin suppression, the degree of which was related to the extent of adluminal germ cell suppression.Sertoli cell TJs are vital components of the blood-testis barrier (BTB) that sequester developing adluminal meiotic germ cells and spermatids from the vascular compartment. Claudin-11 knockout mice are infertile; additionally claudin-11 is spatially disrupted in chronically gonadotropin-suppressed rats coincident with a loss of BTB function, and claudin-11 is disorganized in various human testicular disorders. These data support the Sertoli cell TJ as a potential site of hormonal contraceptive action.BTB proteins were assessed by immunohistochemistry (n = 16 samples) and mRNA (n = 18 samples) expression levels in available archived testis tissue from a previous study of 22 men who had undergone 8 weeks of gonadotropin suppression and for whom meiotic and post-meiotic germ cell numbers were available. The gonadotropin suppression regimens were (i) testosterone enanthate (TE) plus the GnRH antagonist, acyline (A); (ii) TE + the progestin, , (LNG); (iii) TE + LNG + A or (iv) TE + LNG + the 5α-reductase inhibitor, dutasteride (D). A control group consisted of seven additional men, with three archived samples available for this study.Immunohistochemical localization of claudin-11 (TJ) and other junctional type markers [ZO-1 (cytoplasmic plaque), β-catenin (adherens junction), connexin-43 (gap junction), vinculin (ectoplasmic specialization) and β-actin (cytoskeleton)] and quantitative PCR was conducted using matched frozen testis tissue.Claudin-11 formed a continuous staining pattern at the BTB in control men. Regardless of gonadotropin suppression treatment, claudin-11 localization was markedly disrupted and was broadly associated with the extent of meiotic/post-meiotic germ cell suppression; claudin-11 staining was (i) punctate (i.e. 'spotty' appearance) at the basal aspect of tubules when the average numbers of adluminal germ cells were <15% of control, (ii) presented as short fragments with cytoplasmic extensions when numbers were 15-25% of control or (iii) remained continuous when numbers were >40% of control. Changes in localization of connexin-43 and vinculin were also observed (smaller effects than for claudin-11) but ZO-1, β-catenin and β-actin did not differ, compared with control.Claudin-11 was the only Sertoli cell TJ protein investigated, but it is considered to be the most pivotal of constituent proteins given its known implication in infertility and BTB function. We were limited to testis samples which had been gonadotropin-suppressed for 8 weeks, shorter than the 74-day spermatogenic wave, which may account for the heterogeneity in claudin-11 and germ cell response observed among the men. Longer suppression (12-24 weeks) is known to suppress germ cells further and claudin-11 disruption may be more uniform, although we could not access such samples.These findings are important for our understanding of the sites of action of male hormonal contraception, because they suggest that BTB function could be ablated following long-term hormone suppression treatment.National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia) Program Grants 241000 and 494802; Research Fellowship 1022327 (to R.I.M.) and the Victorian Government's Operational Infrastructure Support Program.

Nine women chose the -containing IUCD and eight chose a copper IUCD. A cervico-vaginal swab was collected for cytokine analysis pre-insertion and four weeks post-insertion. Significant increases were noted in levels of IL-1α (median 483.4 versus 316.6 pg/mL, p = 0.046), IL-1β (median 605.7 versus 147.3 pg/mL, p = 0.018), IL-6 (median 570.1 versus 157.3 pg/mL, p = 0.046), TNFα (median 1.19 versus 0.6 pg/mL, p = 0.029) and the chemokine MCP-1 (median 340.2 versus 135.2 pg/mL, p = 0.003). No significant changes were noted in the levels of GM-CSF, IL-8, MIG, MIP-3α, RANTES, IL-10, IL-17, IP-10, MIP-1β. Whether this increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels decreases epithelial  integrity and enhances susceptibility to STIs, including HIV, merits further study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26629725>Canadian Contraception Consensus (Part 2 of 4).</a></h2><p>To provide guidelines for health care providers on the use of contraceptive methods to prevent pregnancy and on the promotion of healthy sexuality.Guidance for Canadian practitioners on overall effectiveness, mechanism of action, indications, contraindications, non-contraceptive benefits, side effects and risks, and initiation of cited contraceptive methods; family planning in the context of sexual health and general well-being; contraceptive counselling methods; and access to, and availability of, cited contraceptive methods in Canada.Published literature was retrieved through searches of Medline and The Cochrane Database from January 1994 to January 2015 using appropriate controlled vocabulary (e.g., contraception, sexuality, sexual health) and key words (e.g., contraception, family planning, hormonal contraception, emergency contraception).

A copper intrauterine device can be used for emergency contraception up to 7 days after unprotected intercourse provided that pregnancy has been ruled out and there are no other contraindications to its insertion. (II-2) 14.  emergency contraception is effective up to 5 days (120 hours) after intercourse; its effectiveness decreases as the time between unprotected intercourse and ingestion increases.

Glycosylation of CVF proteins, such as mucins, IgG and S-IgA, plays a critical role in their immunological functions. Although multiple factors, such as hormones and microflora, may influence glycosylation of the CVF, few studies have examined their impact on this important immunological fluid. Herein we analyzed the glycosylation of cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples collected from 165 women under different hormonal conditions including: (1) no contraceptive, post-menopausal, (2) no contraceptive, days 1-14 of the menstrual cycle, (3) no contraceptive, days 15-28 of the menstrual cycle, (4) combined-oral contraceptive pills for at least 6 months, (5) depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) injections for at least 6 months, (6)  IUD for at least 1 month. Glycomic profiling was obtained using our lectin microarray system, a rapid method to analyze carbohydrate composition. Although some small effects were observed due to hormone levels, the major influence on the glycome was the presence of an altered bacterial cohort due to bacterial vaginosis (BV). Compared to normal women, samples from women with BV contained lower levels of sialic acid and high-mannose glycans in their CVL. The change in high mannose levels was unexpected and may be related to the increased risk of HIV-infection observed in women with BV, as high mannose receptors are a viral entry pathway. Changes in the glycome were also observed with hormonal contraceptive use, in a contraceptive-dependent manner. Overall, microflora had a greater impact on the glycome than hormonal levels, and both of these effects should be more closely examined in future studies given the importance of glycans in the innate immune system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30903201>Involvement of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors in lipid accumulation and depressed G6PD activity in the livers of rats treated with postpartum oral estrogen-progestin.</a></h2><p>Postpartum contraception is an important step for preventing closely spaced pregnancy. Combined oral contraceptive (COC) has been linked to cardiometabolic disturbances. We therefore hypothesized that postpartum oral estrogen-progestin use induces hepatic lipid accumulation that is associated with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation via adenosine deaminase (ADA)/xanthine oxidase (XO)/uric acid (UA)-dependent pathway. Female Wistar rats weighing 130-150 g were mated to achieve timed pregnancy and delivery. Twenty-four (24) dams were randomly assigned to receive vehicle (po), COC (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol and 5.0 μg ; po), COC with GR blockade (mifepristone; 80.0 mg/kg; po) and COC with MR blockade (spironolactone; 0.25 mg/kg; po) daily between 3rd and 11th week postpartum. Data showed that postpartum COC resulted in glucose dysregulation, increased visceral adiposity, liver weight, plasma corticosterone, aldosterone, circulating and hepatic free fatty acid (FFA), triglyceride (TG), adenosine deaminase (ADA), uric acid production, lactate production, and oxidative marker injury. On the other hand, G6PD-dependent antioxidant defenses were depressed by postpartum COC. However, these effects were attenuated by GR or MR blockade. Our data demonstrate that enhanced G6PD-dependent antioxidant defenses and suppressed ADA/XO/UA pathway in the liver by GR or MR blockade improves glucose dysregulation and hepatic TG accumulation induced by postpartum COC. This study implies a plausible involvement of GR and MR via defective G6PD-dependent antioxidant  and increased activity of ADA/XO/UA pathway in postpartum COC-induced hepatic lipid accumulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26330510>The Contribution of Cervicovaginal Infections to the Immunomodulatory Effects of Hormonal Contraception.</a></h2><p>Particular types of hormonal contraceptives (HCs) and genital tract infections have been independently associated with risk of HIV-1 acquisition. We examined whether immunity in women using injectable depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), combined oral contraceptives (COC), or no HCs differs by the presence of cervicovaginal infections. Immune mediators were quantified in cervical swabs from 832 HIV-uninfected reproductive-age Ugandans and Zimbabweans. Bacterial infections and HIV were diagnosed by PCR, genital herpes serostatus by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), altered microflora by Nugent score, and Trichomonas vaginalis and Candida albicans infection by wet mount. Generalized linear models utilizing Box-Cox-Power transformation examined associations between levels of mediators, infection status, and HCs. In no-HC users, T. vaginalis was associated with broadest spectrum of aberrant immunity (higher interleukin 1β [IL-1β], IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein 3α [MIP-3α], β-defensin 2 [BD2], and IL-1 receptor antigen [IL-1RA]). In women with a normal Nugent score and no genital infection, compared to the no-HC group, COC users showed higher levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1RA, while DMPA users showed higher levels of RANTES and lower levels of BD2, both associated with HIV seroconversion. These effects of COC were blunted in the presence of gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, candidiasis, and an abnormal Nugent score; however, RANTES was increased among COC users with herpes, chlamydia, and abnormal Nugent scores. The effect of DMPA was exacerbated by lower levels of IL-1RA in gonorrhea, chlamydia, or herpes, SLPI in gonorrhea, and IL-1β, MIP-3α, and IL-1RA/IL1β ratio in trichomoniasis. Thus, the effects of HC on cervical immunity depend on the genital tract microenvironment, and a weakened mucosal barrier against HIV may be a combined resultant of genital tract infections and HC use.In this article, we show that in young reproductive-age women most vulnerable to HIV, hormonal contraceptives are associated with altered cervical immunity in a manner dependent on the presence of genital tract infections. Through altered immunity, hormones may predispose women to bacterial and viral pathogens; conversely, a preexisting specific infection or disturbed vaginal  may suppress the immune activation by  or exacerbate the suppressed immunity by DMPA, thus increasing HIV risk by their cumulative action. Clinical studies assessing the effects of contraception on HIV susceptibility and mucosal immunity may generate disparate results in populations that differ by  background or prevalence of undiagnosed genital tract infections. A high prevalence of asymptomatic infections among HC users that remain undiagnosed and untreated raises even more concerns in light of their combined effects on biomarkers of HIV risk. The molecular mechanisms of the vaginal microbiome's simultaneous interactions with hormones and HIV remain to be elucidated.Copyright © 2015 Fichorova et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336054>Oral ethinylestradiol- normalizes fructose-induced hepatic lipid accumulation and glycogen depletion in female rats.</a></h2><p>The present study investigated the effects of oral ethinylestradiol- (EEL) on hepatic lipid and glycogen contents during high fructose (HF) intake, and determined whether pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK-4) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity were involved in HF and (or) EEL-induced hepatic dysmetabolism. Female Wistar rats weighing 140-160 g were divided into groups. The control, EEL, HF, and EEL+HF groups received water (vehicle, p.o.), 1.0 μg ethinylestradiol plus 5.0 μg  (p.o.), fructose (10% ), and EEL plus HF, respectively, on a daily basis for 8 weeks. Results revealed that treatment with EEL or HF led to insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, increased hepatic uric acid production and triglyceride content, reduced glycogen content, and reduced production of plasma or hepatic glutathione- and G6PD-dependent antioxidants. HF but not EEL also increased fasting glucose and hepatic PDK-4. Nonetheless, these alterations were attenuated by EEL in HF-treated rats. Our results demonstrate that hepatic lipid accumulation and glycogen depletion induced by HF is accompanied by increased PDK-4 and defective G6PD activity. The findings also suggest that EEL would attenuate hepatic lipid accumulation and glycogen depletion by suppression of PDK-4 and enhancement of a G6PD-dependent antioxidant .</p></html>
