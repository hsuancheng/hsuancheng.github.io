Now we report on the isolation and identification of three triterpenes: two tirucallane-type lanostanoids and one oleanane, which we have identified as  (1), masticadienolic acid (2), and morolic acid (3), respectively. All of them showed effectiveness on the mouse ear  induced by repeated applications of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate and on the phospholipase A2-induced foot paw edema. The pharmacological activity of the compounds was ratified by a histological study of the ear samples. In addition, they inhibited leukotriene B4 production in rat polymorphonuclear leukocytes stimulated with calcium ionophore A 23187.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10624869>Phytochemical study of cuachalalate (Amphiptherygium adstringens, Schiede ex Schlecht).</a></h2><p>Cuachalalate is an endemic plant of Mexico and belongs to the Julianiaceae family. It is a resinous and dioecious plant and is a medicinal plant commonly used in Mexico. Its curative properties are: cholesterol lowering, anti-inflammatory, antiulcerous agent. The collection site is in Barranca Honda, Morelos, Mexico. Three samplings were made during the research period. A decortication of four trees per sex was carried out. An additional collection of resin was made during the last sampling, in order to verify the presence of the compounds of interest. Masticadienonic, alpha-hydroxymasticadienonic and masticadienonic/isomasticadienonic acid mixtures were isolated and identified. Major accumulations of masticadienonic, alpha-hydroxymasticadienonic acids and masticadienonic/isomasticadienonic acid mixtures were related to female plants and a mixture of alpha-hydroxymasticadienonic acid and an unknown compound with male plants. Major accumulation of  occurred in February, and alpha-hydroxymasticadienonic was mainly found in November. An anti-inflammatory test with the alpha-hydroxymasticadienonic acid was made and strong inhibition of the  was observed in a preliminary test.</p></html>
