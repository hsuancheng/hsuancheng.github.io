Meanwhile, burns have become an affliction mainly affecting the less well-developed regions of the world. Early excision and skin grafting has led to major improvements in therapeutic outcomes.The purpose of this article is to survey the use of pharmacotherapy to treat different pathophysiological complications of burn injury. The author, herein, discusses the use of drug treatments for a number of systemic metabolic disturbances including hyperglycemia, elevated catabolism, and .Advancements in personalized and molecular medicine will make an impact on burn therapy. Similarities between severe burns and other critically ill patients will lead to cross-fertilization between different medical specialties. Furthermore, advances in stem cells and tissue regeneration will lead to improved healing and less lifelong disability. Indeed, research in new drug therapy for burns is actively progressing for many different complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28177684>Aegle marmelos impedes onset of insulin resistance syndrome in rats provided with drinking fructose from weaning to adulthood stages of development - a mechanistic study.</a></h2><p>In this study, we explored the effect of aqueous extract of leaves of Aegle marmelos (AM) on hepatic carbohydrate metabolism and insulin downstream signalling in rats given fructose (15%) in drinking water from weaning to adulthood. Wistar albino rats (4 weeks old) were randomly divided into normal control (NC), fructose control (FC), and treatment (AMT) groups and were fed for a period of 8 weeks the following diets: chow + water, chow + fructose (15%), and chow + fructose (15%) + AM (500 mg/kg per day, p.o.), respectively. Compared with the NC group, the FC group was found to have significantly (p < 0.05) raised levels of fasting blood glucose, lipid, visceral mass, plasma insulin and leptin, glycogen, and  enzyme but decreased glycolytic enzyme activity. Raised levels of glucose transporter 2 protein but decreased activity of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K/Akt) and Janus kinase - signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (JAK-STAT3) in hepatic tissue indicate a state of insulin and leptin resistance in the FC group. A significant (p < 0.05) lowering of physical and glycemic parameters, strengthening of the hepatic glycolytic pathway over the gluconeogenic pathway, and upregulation of the PI3K/Akt and JAK-STAT3 pathways was observed in the AMT group, as compared with the FC group. For the first time, the mechanism underlying the development of insulin resistance syndrome is delineated here, along with the potential of A. marmelos to impede it.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27605424>Quantitative deviating effects of maple syrup extract supplementation on the hepatic gene expression of mice fed a high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>Maple syrup contains various polyphenols and we investigated the effects of a polyphenol-rich maple syrup extract (MSXH) on the physiology of mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD).The mice fed a low-fat diet (LFD), an HFD, or an HFD supplemented with 0.02% (002MSXH) or 0.05% MSXH (005MSXH) for 4 weeks. Global gene expression analysis of the liver was performed, and the differentially expressed genes were classified into three expression patterns; pattern A (LFD < HFD > 002MSXH = 005MSXH, LFD > HFD < 002MSXH = 005MSXH), pattern  (LFD < HFD = 002MSXH > 005MSXH, LFD > HFD = 002MSXH < 005MSXH), and pattern C (LFD < HFD > 002MSXH < 005MSXH, LFD > HFD < 002MSXH > 005MSXH). Pattern A was enriched in glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, and folate metabolism. Pattern  was enriched in tricarboxylic acid cycle while pattern C was enriched in , cholesterol metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and endoplasmic reticulum stress-related event.Our study suggested that the effects of MSXH ingestion showed (i) dose-dependent pattern involved in energy metabolisms and (ii) reversely pattern involved in stress responses.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Three clinical types are recognized: Type A (infantile form), in which most affected children die in infancy or early childhood. Type  (severe neonatal form), in which affected infants have hepatomegaly, pyramidal tract signs, and abnormal movement and die within the first three months of life. Type C (intermittent/benign form), in which affected individuals have normal or mildly delayed neurologic development and episodic metabolic acidosis.The diagnosis of PC deficiency is established in a proband by identification of PC enzyme deficiency in fibroblasts or lymphoblasts. In individuals with PC deficiency, fibroblast PC enzyme activity is usually less than 5% of that observed in controls. The diagnosis of PC deficiency can also be established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in  on molecular genetic testing. Intravenous glucose-containing fluids, hydration, and correction of the metabolic acidosis are the mainstays of acute management. Correction of biochemical abnormalities and supplementation with citrate, aspartic acid, and biotin may improve somatic findings but not neurologic manifestations. Orthotopic liver transplantation may be indicated in some affected individuals. Anaplerotic therapies such as triheptanoin show some promise, especially regarding the neurologic manifestations, but need to be further evaluated.  Parental education regarding factors that elicit a crisis and early signs of decompensation; written information on the child's disorder and appropriate emergency treatment to be carried at all times; minimization of intercurrent infections and environmental stressors; high-carbohydrate and high-protein diet with frequent feedings to prevent dependence on .  Hospitalization for the management of fever, infection, dehydration, or trauma; intensive proactive medical support to prevent dehydration, hypotension, hypoglycemia, and increasing metabolic acidosis.  Regular monitoring of serum lactate concentrations. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Fasting; the ketogenic diet.PC deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.  somatic pathogenic variants have been reported. If both parents are carriers, sibs of an individual with PC deficiency have a 25% chance of inheriting both pathogenic variants and being affected, a 50% chance of inheriting one pathogenic variant and being carriers, and a 25% chance of inheriting both normal genes and not being carriers. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible by molecular genetic testing if both pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member.Copyright © 1993-2019, University of Washington, Seattle.

The aim of the present study was to screen prognosis‑associated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and construct a risk score system for the disease. The RNA‑sequencing data of patients with HCC (including 100 HCC samples and 26 normal samples) were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. In addition, GSE55092, GSE19665 and GSE10186 datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Combined with weighted gene co‑expression network analysis, the identification and functional annotation of stable modules was performed. Using the MetaDE package, the consensus differentially expressed RNAs (DE‑RNAs) were analyzed. To construct a risk score system, prognosis‑associated lncRNAs and the optimal lncRNA combination were separately analyzed by survival and penalized packages. Finally, pathway enrichment analysis for the nodes in an lncRNA‑mRNA network was conducted via Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. A total of four stable modules and 3,051 consensus DE‑RNAs were identified. The stable modules were significantly associated with the histological grades of HCC, tumor, node and metastasis stage, pathological stage, recurrence and exposure to radiation therapy. A 9‑lncRNA optimal combination [DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 9, glucosidase, β, acid 3 (GBA3), HLA complex group 4, N‑acetyltransferase 8B, neighbor of breast cancer 1 gene 2, prostate androgen‑regulated transcript 1, ret finger protein like 1 antisense RNA 1, solute carrier family 22 member 18 antisense and T‑cell leukemia/lymphoma 6] was selected from the 14 prognosis‑associated lncRNAs, and was further supported by the validation dataset, GSE10186. The lncRNA‑mRNA co‑expression network revealed lncRNA GBA3 as a positive regulator of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2, an important enzyme in the metabolic pathway of . A risk score system was established based on the optimal 9 lncRNAs, which may be valuable for predicting the prognosis of patients with HBV‑positive HCC and improving understanding of mechanisms associated with the pathogenesis of this disease. On the contrary, a larger, independent cohort of patients is required to further validate the risk‑score system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27208254>Transcriptomes of Eight Arabidopsis thaliana Accessions Reveal Core Conserved, Genotype- and Organ-Specific Responses to Flooding Stress.</a></h2><p>Climate change has increased the frequency and severity of flooding events, with significant negative impact on agricultural productivity. These events often submerge plant aerial organs and roots, limiting growth and survival due to a severe reduction in light reactions and gas exchange necessary for photosynthesis and respiration, respectively. To distinguish molecular responses to the compound stress imposed by submergence, we investigated transcriptomic adjustments to darkness in air and under submerged conditions using eight Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) accessions differing significantly in sensitivity to submergence. Evaluation of root and rosette transcriptomes revealed an early transcriptional and posttranscriptional response signature that was conserved primarily across genotypes, although flooding susceptibility-associated and genotype-specific responses also were uncovered. Posttranscriptional regulation encompassed darkness- and submergence-induced alternative splicing of transcripts from pathways involved in the alternative mobilization of energy reserves. The organ-specific transcriptome adjustments reflected the distinct physiological status of roots and shoots. Root-specific transcriptome changes included marked up-regulation of chloroplast-encoded photosynthesis and redox-related genes, whereas those of the rosette were related to the regulation of development and growth processes. We identified a novel set of tolerance genes, recognized mainly by quantitative differences. These included a transcriptome signature of more pronounced  in tolerant accessions, a response that included stress-induced alternative splicing. This study provides organ-specific molecular resolution of genetic variation in submergence responses involving interactions between darkness and low-oxygen constraints of flooding stress and demonstrates that early transcriptome plasticity, including alternative splicing, is associated with the ability to cope with a compound environmental stress.© 2016 American Society of Plant Biologists.

One of the major problems involving these diseases transmission is that A. aegypti embryos are resistant to desiccation at the end of embryogenesis, surviving and remaining viable for several months inside the egg. Therefore, a fine metabolism control is essential to support these organisms throughout this period of resistance. The carbohydrate metabolism has been shown to be of great importance during arthropod embryogenesis, changing dramatically in order to promote growth and differentiation and in periods of resistance. This study investigated fundamental aspects of glucose metabolism in three stages of A. aegypti egg development: pre-desiccated, desiccated, and rehydrated. The activities of regulatory enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism such as pyruvate kinase, hexokinase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase were evaluated. We show that these activities were reduced in A. aegypti desiccated eggs, suggesting a decreased activity of glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway. In contrast,  increased in desiccated eggs, which uses protein as substrate to synthesize glucose. Accordingly, protein amount decreased during this stage, while glucose levels increased. Glycogen content, a major carbohydrate reserve in mosquitoes, was evaluated and shown to be lower in desiccated and rehydrated eggs, indicating it was used to supply energy metabolism. We observed a reactivation of carbohydrate catabolism and an increased  after rehydration, suggesting that controlling glucose metabolism was essential not only to survive the period of desiccation, but also for subsequent larvae hatch. Taken together, these results contribute to a better understanding of metabolism regulation in A. aegypti eggs during desiccation periods. Such regulatory mechanisms enable higher survival rate and consequently promote virus transmission by these important disease vectors, making them interesting subjects in the search for novel control methods.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

It has been suggested that this might lead to hepatotoxicity, including the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. After entering hepatocytes via insulin-independent glucose transporter 2 transmembrane carrier proteins, fructose is phosphorylated to fructose-1-phosphate in a reaction catalysed by fructokinase (ketohexokinase). In turn, fructose-1-phosphate is hydrolysed by aldolase  to glyceraldehydes. Glyceraldehydes may enter  via fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and fructose-6-phosphate; glyceraldehydes may also enter glycogenolysis via pyruvate. The last pathway involves conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Alternatively, pyruvate may be converted, via the action of the hepatic lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme LDH-5, into lactate. In liver damage, the LDH-5 isoenzyme becomes elevated, predominantly in serum/plasma. We therefore hypothesised that if dietary fructose is associated with hepatotoxicity, there should be a positive correlation between erythrocyte fructose-6-phosphate and plasma LDH-5. This hypothesis was tested by assaying venous blood samples taken from 39 patients at rest, three hours after eating. Quantitative Fourier transform infrared spectrometry following gel electrophoresis was used to assay erythrocyte fructose-6-phosphate levels. Similarly, plasma LDH-5 concentrations were spectrophotometrically analysed, using the pyruvate-lactate reaction, following electrophoretic separation of the LDH isoenzymes. A significant positive correlation was found between the two variables (r = 0.44, p = 0.0047). This result, which supports our hypothesis, is evidence in favour of the possibility that dietary fructose is associated with hepatotoxicity. In addition to being a marker of hepatic damage, LDH-5 may play a more direct epigenetic role in causing liver damage; acute hepatic injury is associated with nuclear translocation of LDH, causing the production of lactate from pyruvate in the nucleus; in turn, the lactate inhibits histone deacetylase and is associated with upregulation of genes associated with the damage response, leading to cell death.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Ketotic hypoglycemia is the main symptom and can occur at any age, usually after long periods of fasting or during illness. The diagnosis may be achieved by measurement of the enzyme activity in a liver sample, but FBP1 analysis has become the most common approach.To characterize the genotype of Southern Brazilian FBPase-deficient patients.The FBP1 gene of six unrelated patients (one had consanguineous parents) with previous diagnoses of FBPase deficiency (enzymatic, pts A, , D, E; genetic through Next-Generation Sequencing-NGS, pt F; enzymatic and Sanger sequencing, pt C) was first analyzed through NGS. Pathogenic variants found in NGS were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The pathogenicity of novel missense variants was evaluated through in silico analysis.Five patients (pt A, , D, E, F) had their genotype identified by NGS, all of them being homozygous. In Pt C, NGS detected only one pathogenic variant. Among the 11 alleles analyzed, only three variants were found, two being novel: c.958G > A and c.986T > C. In silico analysis indicated the pathogenicity of both variants. Interestingly, the three variants seem to be linked to specific haplotypes, indicating that an endogamy effect may be acting on these alleles in the population of Southern Brazil.Our data suggest that NGS is a good tool for the diagnosis of FBPase deficiency. Variants c.958G > A and c.986T > C are the most prevalent variants in the country.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

This knowledge is prerequisite for a better understanding of seminal plasma variability, which is linked to semen quality. The objective of this study was to characterize the proteomes of seminal vesicle fluid and seminal plasma and to compare them to better understand the origin of seminal plasma proteins. We collected ejaculates and seminal vesicle fluid postmortem from 6 mature Holstein Friesian bulls. We performed the analysis and identification of proteins using 2-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. We identified 105 proteins in bull seminal vesicle fluid and 88 proteins in seminal plasma. For both seminal vesicles and seminal plasma proteins described in our study, top biological functions were cellular movement, cell death and survival, and cellular growth and proliferation. Additionally, seminal vesicle fluid proteins were involved in protein degradation and synthesis. Seminal plasma proteins were also involved in cellular assembly and organization and cell-to-cell signaling and interactions. Proteins of both fluids were involved in the following canonical pathways: glycolysis, , liver X receptor/farnesoid X receptor, and farnesoid X receptor/retinoid X receptor activation. Additionally, seminal vesicle fluid proteins appeared to be involved in oxidative stress response mediated by nuclear factor E2-related factor 2. Our results described the bull seminal vesicle fluid proteome for the first time and allowed for significant expansion of the current knowledge on the bull seminal plasma proteome. Moreover, analysis indicated that both bull seminal vesicle fluid and seminal plasma proteomes contained interconnected protein groups related to protective functions, glycolysis, and the morphology and physiology of the spermatozoa. These proteins and their interactions could be targeted in future research.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Malnutrition and muscle wasting (sarcopenia) is yet other complications that negatively impact survival, quality of life, and response to stressors, such as infection and surgery in patients with cirrhosis. Conventionally, these are not routinely looked for, because nutritional assessment can be a difficult especially if there is associated fluid retention and/or obesity. Patients with cirrhosis may have a combination of loss of skeletal muscle and gain of adipose tissue, culminating in the condition of "sarcopenic obesity." Sarcopenia in cirrhotic patients has been associated with increased mortality, sepsis complications, hyperammonemia, overt hepatic encephalopathy, and increased length of stay after liver transplantation. Assessment of muscles with cross-sectional imaging studies has become an attractive index of nutritional status evaluation in cirrhosis, as sarcopenia, the major component of malnutrition, is primarily responsible for the adverse clinical consequences seen in patients with liver disease. Cirrhosis is a state of accelerated starvation, with increased  that requires amino acid diversion from other metabolic functions. Protein homeostasis is disturbed in cirrhosis due to several factors such as hyperammonemia, hormonal, and cytokine abnormalities, physical inactivity and direct effects of ethanol and its metabolites. New approaches to manage sarcopenia are being evolved.

Cephalopods are sensitive to starvation because of high metabolic rates and growth rates related to their "live fast, die young" life history. We investigated how enzymatic capacities of key metabolic pathways are modulated during starvation in the common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) to gain insight into the metabolic organization of cephalopods and their strategies for coping with food limitation. In particular, lipids have traditionally been considered unimportant fuels in cephalopods, yet, puzzlingly, many species (including cuttlefish) mobilize the lipid stores in their digestive gland during starvation. Using a comprehensive multi-tissue assay of enzymatic capacities for energy metabolism, we show that, during long-term starvation (12 days), glycolytic capacity for glucose use is decreased in cuttlefish tissues, while capacities for use of lipid-based fuels (fatty acids and ketone bodies) and amino acid fuels are retained or increased. Specifically, the capacity to use the ketone body acetoacetate as fuel is widespread across tissues and gill has a previously unrecognized capacity for fatty acid catabolism, albeit at low rates. The capacity for de novo glucose synthesis (), important for glucose homeostasis, likely is restricted to the digestive gland, contrary to previous reports of widespread  among cephalopod tissues. Short-term starvation (3-5 days) had few effects on enzymatic capacities. Similar to vertebrates, lipid-based fuels, putatively mobilized from fat stores in the digestive gland, appear to be important energy sources for cephalopods, especially during starvation when glycolytic capacity is decreased perhaps to conserve available glucose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29480065>Potential hypoglycemic effect of acetophenones from the root bark of .</a></h2><p>Three new acetophenones, named cynwilforones A-C (-), together with cynandione A () were isolated from the root bark of  (Maxim.)

Despite this, the genetics and physiology of Hanseniaspora species remains poorly understood. The first genomic sequence of a H. guilliermondii strain (UTAD222) and the discussion of its potential significance are presented in this work. Metabolic reconstruction revealed that H. guilliermondii is not equipped with a functional  or glyoxylate cycle, nor does it harbours key enzymes for glycerol or galactose catabolism or for biosynthesis of biotin and thiamine. Also, no fructose-specific transporter could also be predicted from the analysis of H. guilliermondii genome leaving open the mechanisms underlying the fructophilic character of this yeast. Comparative analysis involving H. guilliermondii, H. uvarum, H. opuntiae and S. cerevisiae revealed 14 H. guilliermondii-specific genes (including five viral proteins and one β-glucosidase). Furthermore, 870 proteins were only found within the Hanseniaspora proteomes including several β-glucosidases and decarboxylases required for catabolism of biogenic amines. The release of H. guilliermondii genomic sequence and the comparative genomics/proteomics analyses performed, is expected to accelerate research focused on Hanseniaspora species and to broaden their application in the wine industry and in other bio-industries in which they could be explored as cell factories.© The Author(s) 2018.

Their adaptive success in such challenging environments is largely due to their gill symbiotic association with chemosynthetic bacteria. We examined the response of vent mussels as they adapt to sea-level environmental conditions, through an assessment of the relative abundance of host-symbiont related RNA transcripts to better understand how the gill microbiome may drive host-symbiont interactions in vent mussels during hypothetical venting inactivity.The metatranscriptome of  was sequenced from gill tissues sampled at different time-points during a five-week acclimatization experiment, using Next-Generation-Sequencing. After Illumina sequencing, a total of 181,985,262 paired-end reads of 150 bp were generated with an average of 16,544,115 read per sample. Metatranscriptome analysis confirmed that experimental acclimatization in aquaria accounted for global gill transcript variation. Additionally, the analysis of 16S and 18S rRNA sequences data allowed for a comprehensive characterization of host-symbiont interactions, which included the gradual loss of gill endosymbionts and signaling pathways, associated with stress responses and energy metabolism, under experimental acclimatization. Dominant active transcripts were assigned to the following KEGG categories: "Ribosome", "Oxidative phosphorylation" and "Chaperones and folding catalysts" suggesting specific metabolic responses to physiological adaptations in aquarium environment.Gill metagenomics analyses highlighted microbial diversity shifts and a clear pattern of varying mRNA transcript abundancies and expression during acclimatization to aquarium conditions which indicate change in bacterial community activity. This approach holds potential for the discovery of new host-symbiont associations, evidencing new functional transcripts and a clearer picture of methane metabolism during loss of endosymbionts. Towards the end of acclimatization, we observed trends in three major functional subsystems, as evidenced by an increment of transcripts related to genetic information processes; the decrease of chaperone and folding catalysts and oxidative phosphorylation transcripts; but no change in transcripts of  and co-factors-vitamins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31166954>Muscle fiber hypertrophy in response to 6 weeks of high-volume resistance training in trained young men is largely attributed to sarcoplasmic hypertrophy.</a></h2><p>Cellular adaptations that occur during skeletal muscle hypertrophy in response to high-volume resistance training are not well-characterized. Therefore, we sought to explore how actin, myosin, sarcoplasmic protein, mitochondrial, and glycogen concentrations were altered in individuals that exhibited mean skeletal muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA) hypertrophy following 6 weeks of high-volume resistance training. Thirty previously resistance-trained, college-aged males (mean ± standard deviation: 21±2 years, 5±3 training years) had vastus lateralis (VL) muscle biopsies obtained prior to training (PRE), at week 3 (W3), and at week 6 (W6). Muscle tissue from 15 subjects exhibiting PRE to W6 VL mean fCSA increases ranging from 320-1600 μm2 was further interrogated using various biochemical and histological assays as well as proteomic analysis. Seven of these individuals donated a VL biopsy after refraining from training 8 days following the last training session (W7) to determine how deloading affected biomarkers. The 15 fCSA hypertrophic responders experienced a +23% increase in mean fCSA from PRE to W6 (p<0.001) and, while muscle glycogen concentrations remained unaltered, citrate synthase activity levels decreased by 24% (p<0.001) suggesting mitochondrial volume decreased. Interestingly, repeated measures ANOVAs indicated that p-values approached statistical significance for both myosin and actin (p = 0.052 and p = 0.055, respectively), and forced post hoc tests indicated concentrations for both proteins decreased ~30% from PRE to W6 (p<0.05 for each target). Phalloidin-actin staining similarly revealed actin concentrations per fiber decreased from PRE to W6. Proteomic analysis of the sarcoplasmic fraction from PRE to W6 indicated 40 proteins were up-regulated (p<0.05), KEGG analysis indicated that the glycolysis/ pathway was upregulated (FDR sig. <0.001), and DAVID indicated that the following functionally-annotated pathways were upregulated (FDR value <0.05): a) glycolysis (8 proteins), ) acetylation (23 proteins), c)  (5 proteins) and d) cytoplasm (20 proteins). At W7, sarcoplasmic protein concentrations remained higher than PRE (+66%, p<0.05), and both actin and myosin concentrations remained lower than PRE (~-50%, p<0.05). These data suggest that short-term high-volume resistance training may: a) reduce muscle fiber actin and myosin protein concentrations in spite of increasing fCSA, and ) promote sarcoplasmic expansion coincident with a coordinated up-regulation of sarcoplasmic proteins involved in glycolysis and other metabolic processes related to ATP generation. Interestingly, these effects seem to persist up to 8 days following training.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27405060>Hepatic  cell leukemia-3 promotes hepatic steatosis and inflammation through insulin-sensitive metabolic transcription factors.</a></h2><p>The pathomechanisms underlying non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the involved molecular regulators are incompletely explored. The nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-κ)-cofactor gene  cell leukemia-3 (Bcl-3) plays a critical role in altering the transcriptional capacity of NF-κ - a key inducer of inflammation - but also of genes involved in cellular energy metabolism.To define the role of Bcl-3 in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), we developed a novel transgenic mouse model with hepatocyte-specific overexpression of Bcl-3 (Bcl-3) and employed a high-fat, high-carbohydrate dietary feeding model. To characterize the transgenic model, deep RNA sequencing was performed. The relevance of the findings was confirmed in human liver samples.Hepatocyte-specific overexpression of Bcl-3 led to pronounced metabolic derangement, characterized by enhanced hepatic steatosis from increased de novo lipogenesis and uptake, as well as decreased hydrolysis and export of fatty acids. Steatosis in Bcl-3 mice was accompanied by an augmented inflammatory milieu and liver cell injury. Moreover, Bcl-3 expression decreased insulin sensitivity and resulted in compensatory regulation of insulin-signaling pathways. Based on in vivo and in vitro studies we identified the transcription factors PPARα, PPARγ and PGC-1α as critical regulators of hepatic metabolism and inflammation downstream of Bcl-3. Metformin treatment improved the metabolic and inflammatory phenotype in Bcl-3 mice through modulation of PPARα and PGC-1α. Remarkably, these findings were recapitulated in human NASH, which exhibited increased expression and nuclear localization of Bcl-3.In summary, Bcl-3 emerges as a novel regulator of hepatic steatosis, insulin sensitivity and inflammation in NASH.Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered the most prevalent liver disease worldwide. Patients can develop end-stage liver disease resulting in liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma, but also develop complications unrelated to liver disease, e.g., cardiovascular disease. Still there is no full understanding of the mechanisms that cause NAFLD. In this study, genetically engineered mice were employed to examine the role of a specific protein in the liver that is involved in inflammation and the metabolism, namely Bcl-3. By this approach, a better understanding of the mechanisms contributing to disease progression was established. This can help to develop novel therapeutic and diagnostic options for patients with NAFLD.Copyright © 2016 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier .V.

Although there exists an incredible amount of social media hype and market advertising touting its efficacy for the improvement of hair quantity and quality, biotin's efficacy for hair remains largely unsubstantiated in scientific literature. We reviewed all pertinent scientific literature regarding the efficacy of biotin supplementation for hair growth and quality improvement, and we also investigated its popularity in society defined as a function of market analytics. To date, there have been no clinical trials conducted to investigate the efficacy of biotin supplementation for the treatment of alopecia of any kind, nor has there been any randomized controlled trial to study its effect on hair quality and quantity in human subjects. Because of the lack of clinical evidence, its use to improve hair quantity or quality is not routinely recommended. However, societal infatuation with biotin supplementation is not only propagated by its glamorization in popular media, its popularity is vastly disproportionate to the insufficient clinical evidence supporting it's efficacy in hair improvement. In other words, biotin supplements are quite "in vogue", without there being any real reason to be so.</p> <p><em>J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(5):496-500.</em></p>.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26593707>Betaine prevented fructose-induced NAFLD by regulating LXRα/PPARα pathway and alleviating ER stress in rats.</a></h2><p>Betaine has been proven effective in treating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in animal models, however, its molecular mechanisms remain elusive. The aims of this study were to explore the mechanisms mediating the anti-inflammatory and anti-lipogenic actions of betaine in fructose-fed rats. In this study, betaine improved insulin resistance, reduced body weight gain and serum lipid levels, and prevented hepatic lipid accumulation in fructose-fed rats. It up-regulated hepatic expression of liver X receptor-alpha (LXRα) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα), with the attenuation of the changes of their target genes, including hepatic carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) 1α, glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored high density lipoprotein binding protein 1, apolipoprotein , sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and adipocyte differentiation-related protein, involved in fatty acid oxidation and lipid storage in these model rats. Furthermore, betaine alleviated ER stress and inhibited acetyl-CoA carboxylase α, CPT II, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 and fatty acid synthase expression involved in fatty acid synthesis in the liver of fructose-fed rats. Betaine suppressed hepatic  in fructose-fed rats by moderating protein kinase  -forkhead box protein O1 pathway, as well as p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin activity. Moreover, betaine inhibited hepatic nuclear factor kappa  /nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing-3 inflammasome activation-mediated inflammation in this animal model. These results demonstrated that betaine ameliorated hepatic lipid accumulation, , and inflammation through restoring LXRα and PPARα expression and alleviating ER stress in fructose-fed rats.

In some cases, the glycosidic residue is needed for bioactivity; however, in other cases, glycosylation just improves some pharmacokinetic/dynamic parameters. The patterns of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and human monoamine oxidase A (hMAO-A) inhibition by rubrofusarin 6--β-d-glucopyranoside (), rubrofusarin 6--β-d-gentiobioside (), rubrofusarin triglucoside (), and cassiaside B2 () were compared with the aglycone, rubrofusarin, isolated from  seeds. Rubrofusarin showed potent inhibition against the PTP1B enzyme (IC; 16.95 ± 0.49 μM), and its glycosides reduced activity (IC; 87.36 ± 1.08 μM for  and >100 μM for -) than did the reference drug, ursolic acid (IC; 2.29 ± 0.04 μM). Similarly, in hMAO-A inhibition, rubrofusarin displayed the most potent activity with an IC value of 5.90 ± 0.99 μM, which was twice better than the reference drug, deprenyl HCl (IC; 10.23 ± 0.82 μM). An enzyme kinetic and molecular docking study revealed rubrofusarin to be a mixed-competitive inhibitor of both these enzymes. In a western blot analysis, rubrofusarin increased glucose uptake significantly and decreased the PTP1B expression in a dose-dependent manner in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, increased the expression of phosphorylated protein kinase  (p-Akt) and phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (p-IRS1) (Tyr 895), and decreased the expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), key enzymes of .

Yet there is no cure for patients with skeletal muscle disorders. The group of patients is heterozygous and this thesis is focused on patients with metabolic myopathies and low muscle mass due to severe muscle wasting. Disorders of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) are, along with myophosphorylase deficiency (McArdle disease), the most common inborn errors of metabolism leading to recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis in adults. Prolonged exercise, fasting, and fever are the main triggering factors for rhabdomyolysis in these conditions, and can be complicated by acute renal failure. Patients with low muscle mass are in risk of loosing their functional skills and depend on a wheel chair and respiratory support. We used nutritional interventions and metabolic studies with stable isotope technique and indirect calorimetry in patients with metabolic myopathies and patients with low muscle mass to get information of the metabolism of the investigated diseases, and to gain knowledge of the biochemical pathways of intermediary metabolism in human skeletal muscle. We have shown that patients with fat metabolism disorders in skeletal muscle affecting the transporting enzyme of fat into the mitochondria (carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency) and affecting the enzyme responsible for breakdown of the long-chain fatty acids (very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) have a normal fatty acid oxidation at rest, but enzyme activity is too low to increase fatty acid oxidation during exercise. Furthermore, these patients benefit from a carbohydrate rich diet. Oppositely is exercise capacity worsened by a fat-rich diet in these patients. The patients also benefit from IV glucose, however, when glucose is given orally just before exercise, exercise capacity is worsened, most likely due to the sympatho-adrenergt response, that increases heart rate and blocks . Substrate turnover studies in patients with McArdle disease and phosphorylase  kinase deficiency showed that palmitate lipolysis, utilization and plasma concentration was higher and total CHO lower in the patients during exercise vs. healthy subjects. In patients with low muscle mass glucose homeostasis is impaired, and our findings showed that these patients are prone to develop hypoglycaemia during prolonged fasting. The following studies emphasize the importance of skeletal muscle in production of energy, both when skeletal muscle lack important metabolic enzymes (metabolic myopathies), and when skeletal muscle mass is low.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30241074>Mechanism of YLTZ on glycolipid metabolism based on UPLC/TOF/MS metabolomics.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disease characterized by dysfunction of glycolipid metabolism. YLTZ is used to treat hyperlipidemia, yet its hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic mechanism on T2DM are unknown. Thus, UPLC/TOF/MS was applied in this study to identify the potential bio-markers, and deduce the possible metabolic pathways. According to bio-indexes, the increased blood lipid levels, including TC, TG, LDL and FA, and the decreased HDL, the elevated glucose, reduced insulin level and impaired OGTT were observed in diabetic rat model. While YLTZ can decrease the lipid levels and glucose content, as well as increased insulin standards and improve OGTT. After data from UPLC/TOF/MS processed, 17 metabolites were obtained, including phospholipids (LPCs, PCs and PGP (18:1)), beta-oxidation production (HAA, VAG and CNE) and precursors (THA), bile acid (CA, CDCA and IDCA), hydrolysate of TG (MG (22:4)), glycometabolism (G6P), cholesterol-driven synthetics (ADO) and production of arachidonate acid (THETA). As a result, YLTZ was able to reduce LPCs, PCs, PGP (18:1), HAA, VAG, CNE, CA, ADO and THETA, as well as enhance MG (22:4) and G6P. After analyzing results, several metabolic pathways were deduced, which containing, cholesterol synthesis and elimination, FA beta-oxidation, TG hydrolysis, phospholipids synthesis, glycolysis,  and inflammation. Consequently, YLTZ performed to prohibit the FA beta-oxidation, synthesis of cholesterol and phospholipids,  and inflammation level, as well as promote TG hydrolysis, glycolysis and blood circulation. Hence, applying metabonomics in TCM research can uncover its pharmacological edges, elucidating comprehensively that YLTZ has capacity of hypolipidemic, hypoglycemic and promoting blood circulation, matching the effect of removing blood stasis, eliminating phlegm and dampness.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier .V.

Cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE; also cystathionase), a principal hydrogen sulfide (HS)-synthesizing enzyme in the liver, is involved in glucose and lipid metabolism disorders. However, the roles and precise mechanisms of CSE/HS in obesity and its related insulin resistance remain obscure.

Further study elucidated that the inhibition of insulin and AMPK signaling pathways by CSE deficiency resulted in nuclear accumulation of Forkhead box protein O1 and subsequently promoted hepatic . These phenomena can be reversed by NaHS supplementation. However, in wild-type mice, NaHS treatment ameliorates high fat diet-induced obesity and metabolism disorders, indicating that maintaining an appropriate level of HS is critical for its mutual change of positive and negative effects of obesity-associated insulin resistance.

In eukaryotic cells biotin functions as a prosthetic group of enzymes, collectively known as biotin-dependent carboxylases that catalyze key reactions in gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis, and amino acid catabolism. Enzyme-bound biotin acts as a vector to transfer a carboxyl group between donor and acceptor molecules during carboxylation reactions. In recent years, evidence has mounted that biotin also regulates gene expression through a mechanism beyond its role as a prosthetic group of carboxylases. These activities may offer a mechanistic background to a developing literature on the action of biotin in neurological disorders. This review summarizes the role of biotin in activating carboxylases and proposed mechanisms associated with a role in gene expression and in ameliorating neurological disease.© 2019 SSIEM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254380>Glyceroneogenesis in the hepatopancreas of the crab Neohelice granulata: Diet, starvation and season effects.</a></h2><p>We determined the activity of glyceroneogenesis from [2-C]-pyruvate, the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity, [2-C]-pyruvate oxidation and total lipid levels in the hepatopancreas of the crab Neohelice granulata fed with a carbohydrate-rich (HC) diet or a high-protein (HP) diet and then subjected to 5weeks of starvation, in summer and winter, to determine whether the seasonal adjustments of lipid metabolism to food scarcity are modulated by the composition of the diet previously given to the crabs. The results demonstrated that glyceroneogenesis is an active pathway in N. granulata hepatopancreas, and is regulated by seasonal variations, diet composition and starvation. This study showed that in summer the increase in the hepatopancreas glyceroneogenesis activity is among the strategies used by N. granulata fed an HP diet, to maintain the triglyceride/fatty acid cycle during starvation, a normal condition in the biological cycle of this crab. However, the administration of an HC diet reduced the glyceroneogenesis capacity in response to starvation in summer. In winter, the decrease in the glyceroneogenesis capacity in both fed (HP and HC diets) and starved crabs seems to be a strategy to reduce energy consumption and/or requirement. In contrast to the summer results, the incorporation of [2-C]-pyruvate into CO was markedly higher in both diet (HC and HP) groups and in starved crabs during the winter. Four decades after the first study describing the glyceroneogenesis pathway in rat white adipose tissue, this pathway is evidenced for the first time in a crustacean.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We identified the expression of a G protein-coupled receptor, Gpr17, in the ARH and hypothesized that it contributes to the regulatory function of POMC neurons on metabolism.In order to test this hypothesis, we generated POMC neuron-specific Gpr17 knockout (PGKO) mice and determined their energy and glucose metabolic phenotypes on normal chow diet (NCD) and high-fat diet (HFD).Adult PGKO mice on NCD displayed comparable body composition and metabolic features measured by indirect calorimetry. By contrast, PGKO mice on HFD demonstrated a sexually dimorphic phenotype with female PGKO mice displaying better metabolic homeostasis. Notably, female PGKO mice gained significantly less body weight and adiposity (p < 0.01), which was associated with increased energy expenditure, locomotor activity, and respiratory quotient, while males did not have an overt change in energy homeostasis. Though PGKO mice of both sexes had comparable glucose and insulin tolerance, detailed analyses of liver gene expression and serum metabolites indicate that PGKO mice could have reduced  and increased lipid utilization on HFD. To elucidate the central-based mechanism(s) underlying the better-preserved energy and glucose homeostasis in PGKO mice on HFD, we examined the electrophysiological properties of POMC neurons and found Gpr17 deficiency led to increased spontaneous action potentials. Moreover, PGKO mice, especially female knockouts, had increased POMC-derived alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone and beta-endorphin despite a comparable level of prohormone POMC in their hypothalamic extracts.Gpr17 deficiency in POMC neurons protects metabolic homeostasis in a sex-dependent manner during dietary and aging challenges, suggesting that Gpr17 could be an effective anti-obesity target in specific populations with poor metabolic control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30172809>A study of Bos taurus muscle specific enolase; biochemical characterization, homology modelling and investigation of molecular interaction using molecular docking and dynamics simulations.</a></h2><p>Tropical theileriosis caused by Theileria annulata obligate parasite that infect ruminant animals, including Bos taurus.

Recently, metformin was reported to alter the gut microbiota community in humans, suggesting that the hyperglycemia-lowering action of the drug could be the result of modulating the population of gut microbiota. However, the critical microbial signaling metabolites and the host targets associated with the metabolic benefits of metformin remained elusive. Here, we performed metagenomic and metabolomic analysis of samples from individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) naively treated with metformin for 3 d, which revealed that Bacteroides fragilis was decreased and the bile acid glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) was increased in the gut. These changes were accompanied by inhibition of intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling. We further found that high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed mice colonized with . fragilis were predisposed to more severe glucose intolerance, and the metabolic benefits of metformin treatment on glucose intolerance were abrogated.

Promoting the induction of gluconeogenic genes and blocking that of insulin receptor substrate (Irs)2 in hepatocytes contributes to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. However, the molecular mechanism by which glucagon signalling regulates hepatocyte metabolism is not fully understood. We previously showed that a fasting-inducible signalling module consisting of general control non-repressed protein 5, co-regulator cAMP response element-binding protein binding protein/p300-interacting transactivator with Glu/Asp-rich carboxy-terminal domain 2, and protein kinase A is required for glucagon-induced transcription of gluconeogenic genes. The present study aimed to identify the downstream effectors of this module in hepatocytes by examining glucagon-induced potential target genes. One of these genes was prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD)3, which suppressed stress signalling through inhibition of the Iκ kinase-nuclear factor-κ pathway in a proline hydroxylase-independent manner to maintain insulin signalling. PHD3 was also required for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α-induced , which was dependent on proline hydroxylase activity, suggesting that PHD3 regulates metabolism in response to glucagon as well as insulin.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate protein glycation and antioxidant concentrations in serum samples from several birds of prey (bald eagle (BAEA), red-tailed hawk (RTHA), barred owl (BAOW), great horned owl (GHOW)) as protein glycation can accelerate oxidative stress and vice versa. Serum glucose was measured using a commercially available assay, native albumin glycation was measured by mass spectrometry and various antioxidants (uric acid, vitamin E, retinol and several carotenoids) were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Although glucose concentrations were not significantly different between species (p=0.340), albumin glycation was significantly higher (p=0.004) in BAEA (23.67±1.90%) and BAOW (24.28±1.43%) compared to RTHA (14.31±0.63%). Of the antioxidants examined, lutein was significantly higher in BAOW (p=0.008). BAEA had the highest beta-cryptoxanthin and beta-carotene concentrations (p<0.005). The high concentrations of antioxidants in these birds of prey relative to other birds likely helps protect from complications that may otherwise arise from having high glucose and protein glycation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

To date, limited studies have investigated the effect of extruded products of whole grains on the insulin signaling pathway in vivo. This study investigated the effects of oral consumption of whole grain extrudate, including 97% brown rice and 3% defatted rice bran (w/w, BRD), on glucose metabolism and the hepatic insulin signaling pathway in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice. BRD treatment induced a remarkable reduction in blood glucose. Moreover, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance were ameliorated in the BRD-treated group compared with those in the db/db control group. BRD also increased the hepatic glycogen content by reducing the expression and increasing the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). The activities of glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and their respective mRNA expression levels in the liver were simultaneously decreased in the BRD-treated group. BRD also significantly upregulated the expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and increased the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and protein kinase  (AKT). These results indicate that BRD exhibits antidiabetic potential by activating the IRS1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, further regulating the expression of the  gene and p-GSK3β protein, thus inhibiting hepatic , increasing hepatic glycogen storage, and improving insulin resistance. Therefore, BRD could be used as a functional ingredient to alleviate the symptoms of hyperglycemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27622707>Benzylglucosinolate Derived Isothiocyanate from Tropaeolum majus Reduces Gluconeogenic Gene and Protein Expression in Human Cells.</a></h2><p>Nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus L.) contains high concentrations of benzylglcosinolate. We found that a hydrolysis product of benzyl glucosinolate-the benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC)-modulates the intracellular localization of the transcription factor Forkhead box O 1 (FOXO1). FoxO transcription factors can antagonize insulin effects and trigger a variety of cellular processes involved in tumor suppression, longevity, development and metabolism. The current study evaluated the ability of BITC-extracted as intact glucosinolate from nasturtium and hydrolyzed with myrosinase-to modulate i) the insulin-signaling pathway, ii) the intracellular localization of FOXO1 and, iii) the expression of proteins involved in , antioxidant response and detoxification. Stably transfected human osteosarcoma cells (U-2 OS) with constitutive expression of FOXO1 protein labeled with GFP (green fluorescent protein) were used to evaluate the effect of BITC on FOXO1. Human hepatoma HepG2 cell cultures were selected to evaluate the effect on gluconeogenic, antioxidant and detoxification genes and protein expression. BITC reduced the phosphorylation of protein kinase  (AKT/PKB) and FOXO1; promoted FOXO1 translocation from cytoplasm into the nucleus antagonizing the insulin effect; was able to down-regulate the gene and protein expression of gluconeogenic enzymes; and induced the gene expression of antioxidant and detoxification enzymes. Knockdown analyses with specific siRNAs showed that the expression of gluconeogenic genes was dependent on nuclear factor (erythroid derived)-like2 (NRF2) and independent of FOXO1, AKT and NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1). The current study provides evidence that BITC might have a role in type 2 diabetes T2D by reducing hepatic glucose production and increasing antioxidant resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28973717>Tissue distribution and early developmental expression patterns of aldolase A, , and C in grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idellus.</a></h2><p>Aldolase is a key enzyme involved in glycolysis, , and the pentose phosphate pathway. To establish the expression patterns of all three aldolase isozyme genes in different tissues and during early embryogenesis in lower vertebrates, as well as to explore the functional differences between these three isozymes, the grass carp was selected as a model owing to its relatively high glucose-metabolizing capability. Based on the cDNA sequences of the aldolase A, , and C genes, the expression patterns of these three isozymes were analyzed in different tissues and during early embryogenesis using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Sequence analysis of cDNAs indicated that aldolase A, , and C (GenBank accession numbers: KM192250, KM192251, and KM192252) consist of 364, 364, and 363 amino acids, respectively. The qRT-PCR results showed that the expression levels of aldolase A, , and C were highest in the muscle, liver, and brain, respectively. Aldolase A and C exhibited similar expression patterns during embryogenesis, with high levels observed in unfertilized and fertilized eggs and at the blastocyst stage, followed by a decline and then increase after organogenesis. In contrast, aldolase  transcript was not detected during the unfertilized egg stage, and appeared only from gastrulation; the expression increased markedly during the feeding period (72 h after hatching), at which point the level was higher than those of aldolase A and C. These data suggest that the glucose content of grass carp starter feed should be adjusted according to the metabolic activity of aldolase .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30066289>Inhibition of NF-κ Reduces Renal Inflammation and Expression of PEPCK in Type 2 Diabetic Mice.</a></h2><p>Renal  is markedly promoted in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); however, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Renal  is found to be negatively regulated by insulin. T2DM is characterized by chronic and subacute inflammation; however, inflammation has been well recognized to induce insulin resistance. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether the enhanced renal  in T2DM was partially due to the renal inflammation-mediated insulin resistance. If so, whether inflammation inhibitor could partially reverse such change. Diabetic db/db mice and db/m mice were used in our study. Typically, diabetic db/db mice were intraperitoneally treated with 1 mg/kg NF-κ inhibitor parthenolide (PTN) or saline as control every other day. Twelve weeks after treatment, animal samples were collected for measurements. Our results suggested that the expression levels of the inflammatory factors and the gluconeogenic rate-limiting enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) were up-regulated in renal cortex of both db/db mice and T2DM patients. Moreover, reduced insulin signaling, as well as up-regulated expression of downstream genes FOXO1 and PGC-1ɑ, could be detected in renal cortex of db/db mice compared with that of db/m mice. Consistent with our hypothesis, PTN treatment could alleviate renal inflammation and insulin resistance in db/db mice. Moreover, it could also down-regulate the renal expression of PEPCK, indicating that inflammation could be one of the triggers of insulin resistance and the enhanced renal  in db/db mice. This study can shed light on the role of inflammation in the enhanced renal  in T2DM, which may yield a novel target for hyperglycemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29389630>Cagaita fruit (Eugenia dysenterica DC.) and obesity: Role of polyphenols on already established obesity.</a></h2><p>Polyphenol-rich cagaita (Eugenia dysenterica DC.) extracts (PCE) have previously shown to prevent body weight and adiposity induced by high-fat/high-sucrose (HFS) diet. Whether PCE also exerts protective effects in already developed obesity is unknown. In order to test this hypothesis, male C57BL/6J obese mice (previously feed with a HFS diet for six weeks) were treated with PCE at two doses, 7mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/kg body weight (PCE I group), and 14mg GAE/kg body weight (PCE II group) or water (HFS and Chow groups) by oral gavage for eight weeks. PCE did not affect body weight and adiposity of obese mice. However, PCE did protect against dyslipidemia, fasting hyperglycemia, and glucose intolerance, and attenuated both hepatic  and inflammation as observed by the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α and transcriptional factor NF-κ. These results indicate that PCE improves glucose homeostasis of obese mice by attenuating hepatic  and inflammation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Cortisol is the main circulating glucocorticoid in fish and its action is mediated through its cytosolic receptor, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and regulates the expression of genes involved in growth, metabolism and immune function. When taken together, the data suggests that cortisol may be playing a key role in the energy substrate re-partitioning in hepatocytes to cope with stress. The proposed model is that cortisol upregulates pathways involved in energy substrate mobilization, including , while downregulating energy demanding pathways, including growth and immune function. Recent work also points to a role for cortisol in mediating rapid action that is non-genomic and includes modulation of secondary signalling cascades; however, the physiological relevance of these studies remains to be determined. Altogether, studies carried out in hepatocytes are bringing to fore the complex nature of the cortisol signalling pathways in the organismal stress response. The mode of actions and their physiological implications for stress coping awaits further study.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Our objectives were to test the hypothesis that the proposed CREB/CRTC2 inhibitor salt inducible kinase 1 (SIK1) contributes to whole body glucose homeostasis in vivo by regulating hepatic transcription of gluconeogenic genes and also to identify novel SIK1 actions on glucose metabolism.We created conditional (floxed) SIK1-knockout mice and studied glucose metabolism in animals with global, liver, adipose or skeletal muscle Sik1 deletion. We examined cAMP-dependent regulation of SIK1 and the consequences of SIK1 depletion on primary mouse hepatocytes. We probed metabolic phenotypes in tissue-specific SIK1 knockout mice fed high fat diet through hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps and biochemical analysis of insulin signaling.SIK1 knockout mice are viable and largely normoglycemic on chow diet. On high fat diet, global SIK1 knockout animals are strikingly protected from glucose intolerance, with both increased plasma insulin and enhanced peripheral insulin sensitivity. Surprisingly, liver SIK1 is not required for regulation of CRTC2 and , despite contributions of SIK1 to hepatocyte CRTC2 and  regulation ex vivo. Sik1 mRNA accumulates in skeletal muscle of obese high fat diet-fed mice, and knockout of SIK1 in skeletal muscle, but not liver or adipose tissue, improves insulin sensitivity and muscle glucose uptake on high fat diet.SIK1 is dispensable for glycemic control on chow diet. SIK1 promotes insulin resistance on high fat diet by a cell-autonomous mechanism in skeletal muscle. Our study establishes SIK1 as a promising therapeutic target to improve skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity in obese individuals without deleterious effects on hepatic glucose production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28991180>Robust Regression Analysis of GCMS Data Reveals Differential Rewiring of Metabolic Networks in Hepatitis  and C Patients.</a></h2><p>About one in 15 of the world's population is chronically infected with either hepatitis virus  (HBV) or C (HCV), with enormous public health consequences. The metabolic alterations caused by these infections have never been directly compared and contrasted. We investigated groups of HBV-positive, HCV-positive, and uninfected healthy controls using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses of their plasma and urine. A robust regression analysis of the metabolite data was conducted to reveal correlations between metabolite pairs. Ten metabolite correlations appeared for HBV plasma and urine, with 18 for HCV plasma and urine, none of which were present in the controls. Metabolic perturbation networks were constructed, which permitted a differential view of the HBV- and HCV-infected liver. HBV hepatitis was consistent with enhanced glucose uptake, glycolysis, and pentose phosphate pathway metabolism, the latter using xylitol and producing threonic acid, which may also be imported by glucose transporters. HCV hepatitis was consistent with impaired glucose uptake, glycolysis, and pentose phosphate pathway metabolism, with the tricarboxylic acid pathway fueled by branched-chain amino acids feeding  and the hepatocellular loss of glucose, which most probably contributed to hyperglycemia. It is concluded that robust regression analyses can uncover metabolic rewiring in disease states.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26902586>Looking at the metabolic consequences of the colchicine-based in vivo autophagic flux assay.</a></h2><p>Monitoring autophagic flux in vivo or in organs remains limited and the ideal methods relative to the techniques possible with cell culture may not exist. Recently, a few papers have demonstrated the feasibility of measuring autophagic flux in vivo by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of pharmacological agents (chloroquine, leupeptin, vinblastine, and colchicine). However, the metabolic consequences of the administration of these drugs remain largely unknown. Here, we report that 0.8 mg/kg/day IP colchicine increased LC3-II protein levels in the liver of fasted trout, supporting the usefulness of this drug for studying autophagic flux in vivo in our model organism. This effect was accompanied by a decrease of plasma glucose concentration associated with a fall in the mRNA levels of -related genes. Concurrently, triglycerides and lipid droplets content in the liver increased. In contrast, transcript levels of β-oxidation-related gene Cpt1a dropped significantly. Together, these results match with the reported role of autophagy in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and intracellular lipid stores, and highlight the importance of considering these effects when using colchicine as an in vivo "autophagometer."</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31223033>Pterostilbene reverses palmitic acid mediated insulin resistance in HepG2 cells by reducing oxidative stress and triglyceride accumulation.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance (IR) is known to precede onset of type 2 diabetes and increased oxidative stress appears to be a deleterious factor leading to IR. In this study, we evaluated ability of pterostilbene (PTS), a methoxylated analogue of resveratrol and a known antioxidant, to reverse palmitic acid (PA)-mediated IR in HepG2 cells. PTS prevented reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and subsequent oxidative lipid damage by reducing the expression of NADPH oxidase 3 (NOX3) in PA treated HepG2 cells. Hepatic glucose production was used as a measure of IR and PTS reversed PA-mediated increase in hepatic glucose production by reducing expression of genes coding for gluconeogenic enzymes namely glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and pyruvate carboxylase (PC); and their transcription factors cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and fork head class Box O (FOXO1) along with its coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1 α (PGC1α). PTS reversed PA-mediated activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which in turn altered insulin signalling pathway by phosphorylating IRS-1 at Ser 307, leading to inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β. PTS also reduced PA-mediated lipid accumulation by reducing expression of transcription factors SREBP1c and PPARα. SREBP1c activates genes involved in fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis while PPARα activates CPT1, a rate limiting enzyme for controlling entry and oxidation of fatty acids into mitochondria. PTS, however, did not influence PA uptake confirmed by using BODIPY-labelled fluorescent C16 fatty acid analogue. Thus, our data provides a possible mechanistic explanation for reversal of PA-mediated IR in HepG2 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30321069>Metformin increases glucose uptake and acts renoprotectively by reducing SHIP2 activity.</a></h2><p>Metformin, the first-line drug to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D), inhibits mitochondrial glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase in the liver to suppress . However, the direct target and the underlying mechanisms by which metformin increases glucose uptake in peripheral tissues remain uncharacterized. Lipid phosphatase Src homology 2 domain-containing inositol-5-phosphatase 2 (SHIP2) is upregulated in diabetic rodent models and suppresses insulin signaling by reducing Akt activation, leading to insulin resistance and diminished glucose uptake. Here, we demonstrate that metformin directly binds to and reduces the catalytic activity of the recombinant SHIP2 phosphatase domain in vitro. Metformin inhibits SHIP2 in cultured cells and in skeletal muscle and kidney of db/db mice. In SHIP2-overexpressing myotubes, metformin ameliorates reduced glucose uptake by slowing down glucose transporter 4 endocytosis. SHIP2 overexpression reduces Akt activity and enhances podocyte apoptosis, and both are restored to normal levels by metformin. SHIP2 activity is elevated in glomeruli of patients with T2D receiving nonmetformin medication, but not in patients receiving metformin, compared with people without diabetes. Furthermore, podocyte loss in kidneys of metformin-treated T2D patients is reduced compared with patients receiving nonmetformin medication. Our data unravel a novel molecular mechanism by which metformin enhances glucose uptake and acts renoprotectively by reducing SHIP2 activity.-Polianskyte-Prause, Z., Tolvanen, T.

Inhibition of FBPase enzyme causing blockage of the  process represents a newer scheme in the progress of anti-diabetic drugs. The current research describes the development of hybrid optimal descriptors-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models intended for a set of 62 FBPase inhibitors with the Monte Carlo method. The molecular structures were expressed by the simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) notation. Three splits were prepared by random division of the molecules into training set, calibration set and validation set. Statistical parameters obtained from QSAR modelling were good for various designed splits. The best QSAR model showed the following parameters: the values of r for calibration set and validation set of the best model were 0.6837 and 0.8623 and of Q were 0.6114 and 0.8036, respectively. Based on the results obtained for correlation weights, different structural attributes were described as promoter of the endpoint. Further, these structural attributes were used in designing of new FBPase inhibitors and a molecular docking study was completed for the determination of interactions of the designed molecules with the enzyme.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116420>Health outcomes of a high fructose intake: the importance of physical activity.</a></h2><p>Fructose metabolism is generally held to occur essentially in cells of the small bowel, the liver, and the kidneys expressing fructolytic enzymes (fructokinase, aldolase  and a triokinase). In these cells, fructose uptake and fructolysis are unregulated processes, resulting in the generation of intracellular triose phosphates proportionate to fructose intake. Triose phosphates are then processed into lactate, glucose and fatty acids to serve as metabolic substrates in other cells of the body. With small oral loads, fructose is mainly metabolized in the small bowel, while with larger loads fructose reaches the portal circulation and is largely extracted by the liver. A small portion, however, escapes liver extraction and is metabolized either in the kidneys or in other tissues through yet unspecified pathways. In sedentary subjects, consumption of a fructose-rich diet for several days stimulates hepatic de novo lipogenesis, increases intrahepatic fat and blood triglyceride concentrations, and impairs insulin effects on hepatic glucose production. All these effects can be prevented when high fructose intake is associated with increased levels of physical activity. There is also evidence that, during exercise, fructose carbons are efficiently transferred to skeletal muscle as glucose and lactate to be used for energy production. Glucose and lactate formed from fructose can also contribute to the re-synthesis of muscle glycogen after exercise. We therefore propose that the deleterious health effects of fructose are tightly related to an imbalance between fructose energy intake on one hand, and whole-body energy output related to a low physical activity on the other hand.© 2019 The Authors.

Their small molecular weight coupled with high non-polar nature make them the most abundant components of essential oils which are often considered to have some general antioxidant and antimicrobial effects at fairly high concentrations. These compounds are however reported to have antidiabetic effects in recent years. Thanks to the ingenious biosynthetic machinery of nature, they also display a fair degree of structural complexity/diversity for further consideration in structure-activity studies. In the present communication, the merit of monoterpenes as antidiabetic agents is scrutinized by assessing recent in vitro and in vivo studies reported in the scientific literature.

The net effect is to reduce photorespiration while increasing water and nitrogen use efficiencies. Species that use C photosynthesis have evolved independently from their C ancestors on more than 60 occasions. Along with mimicry and the camera-like eye, the C pathway therefore represents a remarkable example of the repeated evolution of a highly complex trait. In this review, we provide evidence that the polyphyletic evolution of C photosynthesis is built upon pre-existing metabolic and genetic networks. For example, cells around veins of C species show similarities to those of the C bundle sheath in terms of C acid decarboxylase activity and also the photosynthetic electron transport chain. Enzymes of C photosynthesis function together in  during early seedling growth of C Furthermore, multiple C genes appear to be under control of both light and chloroplast signals in the ancestral C state. We, therefore, hypothesize that relatively minor rewiring of pre-existing genetic and metabolic networks has facilitated the recurrent evolution of this trait. Understanding how these changes are likely to have occurred could inform attempts to install C traits into C crops.This article is part of the themed issue 'Enhancing photosynthesis in crop plants: targets for improvement'.© 2017 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28512464>Insights into the Mechanism of Proliferation on the Special Microbes Mediated by Phenolic Acids in the  Rhizosphere under Continuous Monoculture Regimes.</a></h2><p>As potent allelochemicals, phenolic acids are believed to be associated with replanting disease and cause microflora shift and structural disorder in the rhizosphere soil of continuously monocultured .

Recent studies have reported its cardioprotective effect in glucocorticoid (GC)-induced hypertensive rats. Nevertheless, its beneficial role has not been investigated in the setting of GCs excess-induced insulin resistance. This study aimed to investigate the possible protective potential and the plausible mechanisms of pretreatment with PCA against GCs-induced insulin resistance, liver steatosis and vascular dysfunction. Insulin resistance was induced in male Wistar rats by a 7-day treatment with dexamethasone (DEX) (1 mg/kg/day, i.p.). PCA (50, 100 mg/kg/day, orally) was started 7 days before DEX administration and continued during the test period. PCA significantly and dose-dependently attenuated DEX-induced a) glucose intolerance (↓ AUC), ) hyperglycemia (↓ fasting blood glucose), c) impaired insulin sensitivity [↓fasting plasma insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index)] and d) dyslipidemia (↓total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and very low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol). PCA mitigated DEX-induced liver steatosis with associated reduction in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity. Moreover, PCA ameliorated DEX-induced vascular dysfunction and enhanced ACh-induced relaxation in aortic rings. The metabolic ameliorating effects of PCA might be attributed to the enhanced insulin signaling in soleus muscles (↑AKT phosphorylation) and mitigating  (↓ hepatic mRNA expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase).

PCA restored normal oxidative balance [↓ oxidant species, malondialdehyde (MDA) and (↑ antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD)]. The findings herein reveal for the first time that PCA may be taken as a supplement with GCs to limit their metabolic and vascular side effects through its hypoglycemic, insulin-sensitizing, hypolipidemic and antioxidant effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

The present study explored the ability and potential mechanism(s) by which SP induced glucose lowering impact in diabetic rat model. Forty rats were allocated into four groups: control; streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes (STZ, 45mg/kg .w., intraperitoneally); SP (500mg/kg .w., orally twice weekly for 2 months) and STZ-induced diabetes+SP group. In the STZ-induced diabetic rats, SP significantly decreased (P>0.05) serum glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and significantly increased (P>0.05) serum insulin, the activity of antioxidant enzymes and normalized their mRNA gene expression. Furthermore, SP attenuates STZ-induced upregulation of the gluconeogenic enzyme pyruvate carboxylase (PC), the pro-apoptotic Bax and caspase-3 (CASP-3), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) gene expression. The Western blot results revealed that, SP induced downregulation of mitogen activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK) protein expression in hepatic tissues of diabetic rats. Additionally, SP reestablished the typical histological structure of the liver and pancreas of diabetic rats. Acute toxicity study further shows that SP is relatively safe. This study demonstrates that SP is rich in antioxidant compounds and has powerful glucose lowering effect through the normalization of increased hepatic PC gene expression. Interestingly, SP induced recovery of damaged hepatocytes and pancreatic β-cells via its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties. The MAPK signaling cascade is a pivotal component of the proapoptotic signaling pathway induced by diabetes mellitus. MAPK activation may be dependent from ROS production, since SP which exhibited antioxidant activities did have a significant impact on MAPK activity.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Due to stimulated , insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was decreased in HepG2 cells. In our previous study, we found that PFOS disturbed autophagy in HepG2 cells. We proposed that PFOS could inhibit the activation of AKT through inhibiting mTORC2, a key regulator of autophagy. In this study, we found that the levels of triglyceride were increased in HepG2 cells. PFOS-induced accumulation of hepatic lipids also contributed to the inhibition of AKT.

The top five canonical pathways associated with BLE were Methylglyoxal Degradation III followed by VDR/RXR activation, TR/RXR activation, PXR/RXR activation and . The expression of genes that encode for enzymes involved in methylglyoxal degradation (ADH4, AKR1B10 and AKR1C2) and glycolytic process (ENO3, ALDOC and SLC2A1) was significantly regulated. Owing to the Warburg effect, aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells may increase the level of methylglyoxal, a cytotoxic compound.BLE has the potential to be developed into a novel chemopreventive agent provided that the cytotoxic effects related to methylglyoxal accumulation are minimized in normal cells that rely on aerobic glycolysis for energy supply.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30970232>Baicalein improves glucose metabolism in insulin resistant HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance (IR) is the primary pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, often used in the clinical treatment of T2DM. Baicalein which is considered to have anti-IR effects is one of its active ingredients. IR-induced HepG2 cells were used to investigate the effect of baicalein on glucose metabolism and insulin-signaling pathway, using metformin as a positive control. We found that the use of both baicalein and metformin increased the glucose consumption of IR cells, as well as increasing the pyruvate kinase (PK) and glucokinase (GCK) activity. Also increased was the expression levels of insulin receptor (InsR), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase  (AKT) pathway and glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2). Reduced expression levels were found in that of glucose 6 phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) mRNA. The results confirmed that baicalein (10 and 10 mol/L) promotes glucose uptake and glycolysis, inhibits  of hepatocytes to improve glucose metabolism, and may be as a result from regulation of InsR/IRS-1/PI3K/AKT pathway. Additionally, baicalein has large concentration range on inhibiting IR, and at lower concentrations has strong anti-IR hepatocyte activity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

The rats were treated accordingly for 4 wk. Glycaemic parameters, lipid profile, stress hormones, and adiponectin levels were measured after the treatment. Relative gene expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and γ, lipoprotein lipase as well as gluconeogenic enzymatic activities in different tissues were also determined.Consumption of high-fat, high-sucrose diet triggered hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia, which were effectively attenuated by supplementation with glycyrrhizic acid. Glycyrrhizic acid supplementation also effectively reduced circulating adrenaline, alleviated gluconeogenic enzymes overactivity, and promoted the upregulation of lipoprotein lipase expression in the cardiomyocytes and skeletal muscles. A high calorie diet also triggered hypoadiponectinaemia and suppression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ expression, which did not improve with glycyrrhizic acid treatment.Supplementation with glycyrrhizic acid could alleviate high calorie diet-induced glucose and lipid metabolic dysregulations by reducing circulatory stress hormones, normalizing gluconeogenic enzyme activities, and elevating muscular lipid uptake. The beneficial effects of these bioactivities outweighed the adverse effects caused by diet-induced repression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ expression, resulting in the maintenance of lipid and glucose homeostasis.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Previously, it has been revealed that antidepressant exposure significantly inhibits the growth and development of fish during their early developmental stages. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to identify and compare the underlying mechanisms of action of different antidepressants at the transcriptional level using zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. Through high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data analysis, 32, 34, and 130 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained from zebrafish larvae after 120h of embryonic exposure to sublethal concentrations of amitriptyline, fluoxetine, and mianserin, respectively. The expression profiles of the identified DEGs showed similar trends in response to the three antidepressant treatments, suggesting consistent toxic effects of low concentrations of these three drugs on the regulation of gene expression in fish. Several metabolic and signaling pathways, including glycolysis/ and the insulin pathway, were affected in the exposed fish larvae. The expression profiles of selected DEGs were then verified by the qRT-PCR method, which indicated significant positive correlations with the RNA-Seq results. Next, we determined the concentration-dependent expression patterns of 6 selected DEGs in fish larvae exposed to three antidepressants at a series of environmentally relevant concentrations. The results revealed a significant concentration-dependent reduction in the levels of dual-specificity phosphatase 5 (dusp5) mRNA, as well as a non-concentration-dependent gene expression inhibition of prostaglandin D2 synthase  (ptgdsb); the circadian rhythm-related genes, i.e. those encoding nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (nr1d1) and period 2 (per2); and genes encoding early growth response factors (egr1 and egr4), in the antidepressant-treated fish larvae. In summary, to our knowledge, our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that the three different categories of antidepressants have common effects on the gene expression involved in multiple biological processes and signaling pathways during the early development of fish and thus provide information for characterizing the adverse outcome pathways and on the ecological risk assessment of these pharmaceutical pollutants in the aquatic environment.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier .V.

Aestivating X. laevis reduce their metabolic rate, and rely on anaerobic glycolysis to meet reduced ATP demands. The present study investigated how severe dehydration affected the transcript levels, kinetic profile, and phosphorylation state of the key glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK) in the liver and skeletal muscle of X. laevis. Compared to control frogs, severely dehydrated frogs showed an increase in the transcript abundance of both liver and muscle isoforms of PK. While the kinetics of muscle PK did not differ between dehydrated and control frogs, PK from the liver of dehydrated frogs had a lower K for phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) (38%), a lower K for fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F1,6P) (32%), and a greater activation of PK via F1,6P (1.56-fold). PK from dehydrated frogs also had a lower phosphorylation-state (25%) in comparison to the enzyme from control frogs in the liver. Experimental manipulation of the phosphorylation-state of liver PK taken from control frogs by endogenous protein phosphatases resulted in decreased phosphorylation, and a similar kinetic profile as seen in dehydrated frogs. The physiological consequence of dehydration-induced PK modification appears to adjust PK function to remain active during a metabolically depressed state. This study provides evidence for the maintenance of PK activity through elevated mRNA levels and a dephosphorylation event which activates frog liver PK in the dehydrated state in order to facilitate the production of ATP via anaerobic glycolysis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We therefore investigated the effects of PM2.5 exposure on insulin resistance and the disorders of hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism via hypothalamic inflammation. KKAy mice, a genetically susceptible model of type II diabetes mellitus, were administered intra-cerebroventricularly with IKK2 inhibitor (IMD-0354) and were exposed to either concentrated PM2.5 or filtered air (FA) for 4 weeks simultaneously via a versatile aerosol concentration exposure system.

A metagenome analysis recovered the genome sequences of Candidatus Wolbachia bourtzisii wDacA (supergroup A) and Candidatus Wolbachia pipientis wDacB (supergroup ). Genome read coverage, as well as 16S rRNA clone sequencing, revealed that wDacB was more abundant than wDacA.

MicroRNAs (miRs) may be a potential candidate for treatment of GDM. Herein, we suggested that miR-351 could be an inhibitor in the progression of GDM via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase  (PI3K/AKT) pathway. Microarray analysis was used to identify differentially expressed genes and predict miRs regulating flotillin 2 (FLOT2). Target relationship between miR-351 and FLOT2 was verified. Gestational diabetes mellitus mice were treated with a series of mimic, inhibitor and small interfering RNA to explore the effect of miR-351 on insulin resistance (IR), cell apoptosis in pancreatic tissues and liver  through evaluating GDM-related biochemical indexes, as well as expression of miR-351, FLOT2, PI3K/AKT pathway-, IR- and liver -related genes. MiR-351 and FLOT2 were reported to be involved in GDM. FLOT2 was the target gene of miR-351. Gestational diabetes mellitus mice exhibited IR and liver , up-regulated FLOT2, activated PI3K/AKT pathway and down-regulated miR-351 in liver tissues. Additionally, miR-351 overexpression and FLOT2 silencing decreased the levels of FLOT2, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, glyeosylated haemoglobin and homeostasis model of assessment for IR index (HOMA-IR), extent of PI3K and AKT phosphorylation, yet increased the levels of HOMA for islet β-cell function, HOMA for insulin sensitivity index and glucose transporter 2 expression, indicating reduced cell apoptosis in pancreatic tissues and alleviated IR and liver .

However, when the external energy supply is interrupted, e.g., during fasting, carbohydrates preserved in the liver and glycogenic precursors derived from other organs are used to maintain blood glucose levels. Glycerol and glycogenic amino acids derived from adipocytes and skeletal muscles are utilized as glycogenic precursors. Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (GPD1), an NAD/NADH-dependent enzyme present in the cytosol, catalyzes the reversible conversion of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). Since G3P is one of the substrates utilized for  in the liver, the conversion of G3P to DHAP by GPD1 is essential for maintaining blood glucose levels during fasting. We focused on GPD1 and examined its roles in  during fasting.Using GPD1 null model BALB/cHeA mice (HeA mice), we measured  from glycerol and the change of blood glucose levels under fasting conditions. We also measured gene expression related to  in the liver and protein metabolism in skeletal muscle. BALB/cBy mice (By mice) were used as a control.The blood glucose levels in the HeA mice were lower than that in the By mice after glycerol administration. Although lack of GPD1 inhibited  from glycerol, blood glucose levels in the HeA mice after 1-4h of fasting were significantly higher than that in the By mice. Muscle protein synthesis in HeA mice was significantly lower than that in the By mice. Moreover, blood alanine levels and usage of alanine for  in the liver were significantly higher in the HeA mice than that in the By mice.Although these data indicate that a lack of GPD1 inhibits  from glycerol, chronic GPD1 deficiency may induce an adaptation that enhances  from glycogenic amino acids.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of the present study was to identify the global gene expression modifications that occur in skeletal muscle following a training regime to prepare for flat racing. Whole transcriptomes of muscle (gluteus medius) were compared between three time points of tissue collection: T (untrained horses), T (horses after intense gallop phase), and T (horses at the end of racing season), 23 samples in total. The numerous groups of exercise-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were related to muscle cell structure and signaling and included insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (), insulin receptor (), transforming growth factor beta receptors 1 and 2 (), vascular endothelial growth factor  (); epidermal growth factor (), hepatocyte growth factor (), and vascular endothelial growth factor D (). In Arabian horses, exercise modified the expression of genes belonging to the PPAR signaling pathway (e.g., , and ), calcium signaling pathway, and pathways associated with metabolic processes (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid metabolism, glycolysis/, and citrate cycle). According to detected gene expression modifications, our results suggested that in Arabian horses, exercise switches energy generation toward fatty acid utilization and enhances glycogen transport and calcium signaling. The use of the RNA-Seq approach in analyzing the skeletal muscle transcriptome allowed for the proposal of a panel of new candidate genes potentially related to body homeostasis maintenance and racing performance in Arabian horses.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29342911>Effects of Acanthopanax senticosus on Brain Injury Induced by Simulated Spatial Radiation in Mouse Model Based on Pharmacokinetics and Comparative Proteomics.</a></h2><p>The active compounds in  (AS) have different pharmacokinetic characteristics in mouse models. C and AUC of  (ASPS) were significantly reduced in radiation-injured mice, suggesting that the blood flow of mouse was blocked or slowed, due to the pathological state of ischemia and hypoxia, which are caused by radiation. In contrast, the ability of various metabolizing enzymes to inactivate, capacity of biofilm transport decrease, and lessening of renal blood flow accounts for radiation, resulting in the accumulation of syringin and eleutheroside E in the irradiated mouse. Therefore, there were higher pharmacokinetic parameters-AUC, MRT, and t of the two compounds in radiation-injured mouse, when compared with normal mouse. In order to investigate the intrinsic mechanism of AS on radiation injury, AS extract's protective effects on brain, the main part of mouse that suffered from radiation, were explored. The function of AS extract in repressing expression changes of radiation response proteins in prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mouse brain included tubulin protein family (α-, β-tubulin subunits), dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (CRMP2), γ-actin, 14-3-3 protein family (14-3-3ζ, ε), heat shock protein 90β (HSP90β), and enolase 2. The results demonstrated the AS extract had positive effects on nerve cells' structure, adhesion, locomotion, fission, and phagocytosis, through regulating various action pathways, such as Hippo, phagosome, PI3K/Akt (phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase ), Neurotrophin, Rap1 (Ras-related protein RAP-1A), gap junction glycolysis/, and HIF-1 (Hypoxia-inducible factor 1) signaling pathways to maintain normal mouse neurological activity.

In addition, this study determined, for the first time, the underlying molecular and pharmacological mechanisms of the extracts on hyperglycemia using long-term double high diet-fed and streptozotocin (STZ) induced type II diabetic mice. In the present study, leaf extract, phloridzin and trilobatin were assessed in vivo (gavage) and in vitro (non-invasive micro-test technique, NMT) in experimental T2DM mice. The biochemical parameters were measured including blood glucose and blood lipid level, liver biochemical indexes, and hepatic glycogen. The relative expression of glycometabolism-related genes was detected. The effect of leaf extracts on physiological glucose flux in liver tissue from control and T2DM mice was also investigated. Body weight of experimental T2DM mice increased significantly after the first week, but stabilized over the subsequent three weeks; body weight of all other groups did not change during the four weeks' study. After four weeks, all treatment groups decreased blood glucose, and treatment with leaf extract had numerous positive effects: a) promoted in glucose uptake in liver, ) increased synthesis of liver glycogen, c) reduced oxidative stress, d) up-regulation of glucokinase (GK), glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) expression in liver, e) down-regulation of glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-P) expression, and f) ameliorated blood lipid levels. Both treatment with trilobatin or phloridzin accelerated liver glycogen synthesis, decreased oxidative stress and increased expression of GK. IRS and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) were both up-regulated after treatment with trilobatin.

The insulin-signaling pathway requires insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and IRS2, which are found to be dysregulated in diabetes and obesity. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1A) is a fasting-induced transcriptional coactivator. In nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and in patients with type 2 diabetes, low hepatic PGC1A levels are associated with insulin resistance. However, how PGC1A activity impacts the hepatic insulin-signaling pathway is still unclear. We used gain- and loss-of-function models in mouse primary hepatocytes and measured hepatocyte insulin response by gene and protein expression and ex vivo glucose production. We found that the PGC1A level determines the relative ratio of IRS1 and IRS2 in hepatocytes, impacting insulin receptor signaling via protein kinase /AKT (AKT). PGC1A drove the expression of IRS2 downstream of glucagon signaling while simultaneously reducing IRS1 expression. We illustrate that glucagon- or PGC1A-induced IRS2 expression was dependent on cAMP Response Element Binding Protein activity and that this was essential for suppression of hepatocyte gluconeogenesis in response to insulin in vitro. We also show that increased hepatic PGC1A improves glucose homeostasis in vivo, revealing a counterregulatory role for PGC1A in repressing uncontrolled glucose production in response to insulin signaling. These data highlight a mechanism by which PGC1A plays dual roles in the control of gluconeogenesis during the fasting-to-fed transition through regulated balance between IRS1 and IRS2 expression.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Through activation of AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) pathway, metformin also mimics caloric restriction health benefits. Aging causes substantial molecular to morphological changes in brain, the brain cells being more susceptible toward oxidative stress mediated damages due to the presence of high lipid content and higher oxygen consumption. Wistar rats (naturally aged and d-galactose induced rat model) were supplemented with metformin (300 mg/kg .w. orally) for 6 weeks. The biomarkers of oxidative stress such as antioxidant capacity (ferric reducing antioxidant potential [FRAP]), malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), protein carbonyl (PCO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and nitric oxide (NO) were measured in brain tissues of control and experimental groups. The results indicate that metformin treatment augmented the levels of FRAP and GSH in naturally aged, and d-gal induced aging model groups compared to the respective controls. In contrast, metformin treated groups exhibited significant reduction in MDA, PCO, ROS, and NO levels and a significant increase in AChE activity in induced aging rats. The administration of d-galactose upregulated the expression of sirtuin-2, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and downregulated the expression of Beclin-1. Metformin supplementation downregulated the d-galactose induced expressions of sirtuin-2, IL-6, and TNF-α expression, whereas upregulated the Beclin-1 expression.

Glucagon-cAMP signaling is the main initiator of the gluconeogenic programs, including glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6pc) gene expression. Pterosin , an ingredient in Pteridium aquilinum, inhibits salt-inducible kinase 3 signaling that represses cAMP-response element-binding protein regulated transcription coactivator 2, an inducer of gluconeogenic programs. As the results, pterosin  promotes G6pc expression even in the absence of cAMP. In this work, however, we noticed that once cAMP signaling was initiated, pterosin  became a strong repressor of G6pc expression. The search for associated transcription factors for pterosin  actions revealed that retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor alpha-steroid receptor coactivator 2 (RORα-SRC2) complex on the G6pc promoter was the target. Meanwhile, pterosin  impaired the oxidation-reduction cycle of coenzyme Q in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS); and antimycin A, an inhibitor of coenzyme Q: cytochrome c-oxidoreductase (termed mitochondrial complex III), also mimicked pterosin  actions on RORα-SRC2 signaling. Although other respiratory toxins (rotenone and oligomycin) also suppressed G6pc expression accompanied by lowered ATP levels following the activation of AMP-activated kinase, minimal or no effect of these other toxins on RORα-SRC2 activity was observed. These results suggested that individual components in OXPHOS differentially linked to different transcriptional machineries for hepatic gluconeogenic programs, and the RORα-SRC2 complex acted as a sensor for oxidation-reduction cycle of coenzyme Q and regulated G6Pc expression.

We examined the effects of a single oral saturated fat load on insulin sensitivity, hepatic glucose metabolism, and lipid metabolism in humans. Similarly, initiating mechanisms were examined after an equivalent challenge in mice.Fourteen lean, healthy individuals randomly received either palm oil (PO) or vehicle (VCL). Hepatic metabolism was analyzed using in vivo 13C/31P/1H and ex vivo 2H magnetic resonance spectroscopy before and during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps with isotope dilution. Mice underwent identical clamp procedures and hepatic transcriptome analyses.PO administration decreased whole-body, hepatic, and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity by 25%, 15%, and 34%, respectively. Hepatic triglyceride and ATP content rose by 35% and 16%, respectively. Hepatic  increased by 70%, and net glycogenolysis declined by 20%. Mouse transcriptomics revealed that PO differentially regulates predicted upstream regulators and pathways, including LPS, members of the TLR and PPAR families, NF-κ, and TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK).Saturated fat ingestion rapidly increases hepatic lipid storage, energy metabolism, and insulin resistance.

We previously demonstrated that S256 in human FOXO1 (FOXO1-S256), equivalent to S253 in mouse FoxO1 (FoxO1-S253), is a key phosphorylation site mediating the effect of insulin as a target of protein kinase  on suppression of FOXO1 activity and expression of target genes responsible for . Here, we investigated the role of FoxO1-S253 phosphorylation in control of glucose homeostasis in vivo by generating global FoxO1-S253A/A knockin mice, in which FoxO1-S253 alleles were replaced with alanine (A substitution) blocking FoxO1-S253 phosphorylation. FoxO1-S253A/A mice displayed mild increases in feeding blood glucose and insulin levels but decreases in fasting blood glucose and glucagon concentrations, as well as a reduction in the ratio of pancreatic α-cells/β-cells per islet. FoxO1-S253A/A mice exhibited a slight increase in energy expenditure but barely altered food intake and glucose uptake among tissues. Further analyses revealed that FoxO1-S253A/A enhances FoxO1 nuclear localization and promotes the effect of glucagon on HGP. We conclude that dephosphorylation of S253 in FoxO1 may reflect a molecular basis of pancreatic plasticity during the development of insulin resistance.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632024>Dietary leucine affects glucose metabolism and lipogenesis involved in TOR/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway for juvenile blunt snout bream Megalobrama amblycephala.</a></h2><p>The present study evaluated the mechanisms governing insulin signaling, glucose metabolism, and lipogenesis in juvenile fish fed with different dietary leucine levels. Fish were fed six practical diets with graded leucine levels ranging from 0.90 to 2.94% of dry basis for 8 weeks. The trial results showed that, compared to the control group (0.90%), optimal dietary leucine level (1.72%) resulted in the up-regulation of mRNA expression related to insulin signaling pathway, including target of rapamycin (TOR), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and protein kinase  (Akt). However, an excessive leucine level (2.94%) led to protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) overexpression and inhibited TOR, IRS-1, PI3K, and Akt mRNA expressions. The protein level of TOR, S6K1, IRS-1, PI3K, and Akt showed a similar result with mRNA level of these genes. Optimal dietary leucine level (1.72%) significantly improved plasma insulin content, while high level of leucine showed an inhibiting phenomenon. Optimal dietary leucine level (1.72%) could reduce plasma glucose by enhancing the ability of glycometabolism including improving glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), glucokinase (GK) expressions and down-regulating phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) expression. While an excessive leucine level (2.94%) resulted in high plasma glucose by inhibiting the ability of glycometabolism including lowering GLUT2 and GK expressions, and improving glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and PEPCK expressions. The relative expressions of pyruvate kinase (PK) and glycogen synthase (GS) were not significantly affected by dietary leucine levels. Dietary leucine level of 1.33% could improve plasma triglyceride content (TG) by enhancing lipogenesis including improving sterol-response element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) expressions compared to the control group (0.90%). Total cholesterol (TC) was not significantly affected by dietary leucine levels. The present results indicate that optimal leucine level could improve  and fatty acid synthesis through improving insulin sensitivity in juvenile blunt snout bream. However, excessive dietary leucine level resulted in high plasma glucose, which led to insulin resistance by inhibiting the gene expressions of insulin signaling pathway and activating gluconeogenesis-related gene expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26758294>Biotechnology of riboflavin.</a></h2><p>Riboflavin (vitamin B2) production has shifted from chemical synthesis to exclusive biotechnological synthesis in less than 15 years. The underlying extraordinary achievement in metabolic engineering and bioprocess engineering is reviewed in this article with regard to the two most important industrial producers Bacillus subtilis and Ashbya gossypii. The respective biosynthetic routes and modifications are discussed, and also the regulation of riboflavin synthesis. As the terminal biosynthesis of riboflavin starts from the two precursors, ribulose 5-phosphate and guanosine triphosphate (GTP), both strains have been optimized for an improved flux through the pentose phosphate pathway as well as the purine biosynthetic pathway. Specific targets for improvement of A. gossypii were the increase of the glycine pool and the increase of carbon flow through the glyoxylic shunt. In . subtilis, research interest, amongst others, has focused on  and overexpression of the rib operon. In addition, insight into large-scale production of vitamin B2 is given, as well as future prospects and possible developments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934933>Comparative Analysis of the Liver Transcriptome among Cattle Breeds Using RNA-seq.</a></h2><p>Global gene expression in liver transcriptome varies among cattle breeds. The present investigation was aimed to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), metabolic gene networks and metabolic pathways in bovine liver transcriptome of young bulls. In this study, we comparatively analyzed the bovine liver transcriptome of dairy (Polish Holstein Friesian (HF);  = 6), beef (Hereford;  = 6), and dual purpose (Polish-Red;  = 6) cattle breeds. This study identified 895, 338, and 571 significant ( < 0.01) differentially expressed (DE) gene-transcripts represented as 745, 265, and 498 hepatic DE genes through the Polish-Red versus Hereford, Polish-HF versus Hereford, and Polish-HF versus Polish-Red breeds comparisons, respectively. By combining all breeds comparisons, 75 hepatic DE genes ( < 0.01) were identified as commonly shared among all the three breed comparisons; 70, 160, and 38 hepatic DE genes were commonly shared between the following comparisons: (i) Polish-Red versus Hereford and Polish-HF versus Hereford; (ii) Polish-Red versus Hereford and Polish-HF versus Polish-Red; and (iii) Polish-HF versus Hereford and Polish-HF versus Polish-Red, respectively. A total of 440, 82, and 225 hepatic DE genes were uniquely observed for the Polish-Red versus Hereford, Polish-HF versus Hereford, and Polish-Red versus Polish-HF comparisons, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) analysis identified top-ranked enriched GO terms ( < 0.01) including 17, 16, and 31 functional groups and 151, 61, and 140 gene functions that were DE in all three breed liver transcriptome comparisons. Gene network analysis identified several potential metabolic pathways involved in glutamine family amino-acid, triglyceride synthesis, , p38MAPK cascade regulation, cholesterol biosynthesis (Polish-Red versus Hereford); IGF-receptor signaling, catecholamine transport, lipoprotein lipase, tyrosine kinase binding receptor (Polish-HF versus Hereford), and PGF-receptor binding, (Polish-HF versus Polish-Red). Validation results showed that the relative expression values were consistent to those obtained by RNA-seq, and significantly correlated between the quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and RNA-seq (Pearson's r  > 0.90). Our results provide new insights on bovine liver gene expressions among dairy versus dual versus beef breeds by identifying the large numbers of DEGs markers submitted to NCBI gene expression omnibus (GEO) accession number GSE114233, which can serve as useful genetic tools to develop the gene assays for trait-associated studies as well as, to effectively implement in genomics selection (GS) cattle breeding programs in Poland.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30008136>Species-specific low plasma glucose in fish is associated with relatively high tissue glucose content and is inversely correlated with cardiac glycogen content.</a></h2><p>The relationship between plasma glucose concentration and intracellular glucose (liver, heart, brain, gill, gonad, intestine, kidney, spleen, white muscle) was determined in fish species with a range in plasma glucose (Atlantic cod, 5.06 mM; cunner, 3.8 mM; rainbow trout, 3.7 mM; lumpfish, 0.9 mM; short-horned sculpin, 0.6 mM; and winter flounder, 0.6 mM). The ratio of intracellular glucose/plasma glucose was always higher than one in liver for all species consistent with a diffusion gradient from the tissue to the plasma. In all other tissues in Atlantic cod, cunner, and rainbow trout the diffusion gradient was from the plasma to the intracellular space. In short-horned sculpin, the mean ratio in heart and white muscle exceeded one and in winter flounder the ratio was significantly greater than one at 5.97 and 2.92 for heart and muscle, respectively. The presence of an active glucose 6-phosphatase in white muscle could account for elevated amounts of free glucose. The white muscle of all species displayed phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and in winter flounder the activity was as high in white muscle as in liver suggesting that  may be associated with a relatively high-muscle glucose content. The glycogen content was highest in liver followed by heart with lower amounts in all other tissues. There was an inverse correlation between heart glycogen content and plasma glucose concentration when all species were included. It is contended that in species with low plasma glucose, heart glycogen is accumulated at a slow rate under normoxia, to be called upon under hypoxic conditions when the gradient for inward diffusion is unfavourable for high rates of glucose metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27686366>Metformin-related lactic acidosis: is it a myth or an underestimated reality?</a></h2><p>Metformin, belonging to a class of drugs called biguanides, is the recommended first-line treatment for overweight patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It has multiple mechanisms of action, such as reduction of , increases peripheral uptake of glucose, and decreases fatty acid oxidation. However, a potential serious complication, defined metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA), is related to increased plasma lactate levels, linked to an elevated plasma metformin concentrations and/or a coexistent condition altering lactate production or clearance. The mortality rate for MALA approaches 50% and metformin has been contraindicated in moderate and severe renal impairment, to minimize its potential toxic levels. Nevertheless, metformin prescription or administration, despite the presence of contraindications or precipitating factors for MALA, was a common topic highlighted in all reviewed papers. Routine assessment of metformin plasma concentration is not easily available in all laboratories, but plasma metformin concentrations measured in the emergency room could ensure the correct diagnosis, eliminating metformin as the cause of lactic acidosis if low plasma levels occurred. Renal replacement therapies have been successfully employed to achieve the correction of metabolic acidosis and rapidly remove metformin and lactate, but the optimal treatment modality for MALA is still controversial.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30041085>H NMR based pharmacometabolomics analysis of metabolic phenotype on predicting metabolism characteristics of losartan in healthy volunteers.</a></h2><p>Inter-individual variability in drug metabolism and disposition is common in both preclinical and clinical researches. Losartan and its active metabolite EXP3174 present a high degree of inter-individual differences in blood concentrations that affect drug efficacy and side effect. Pharmacometabolomics has been increasingly applied on predicting the drug responses by analyzing the differences in metabolic profile. A pre-dose metabolic phenotype was investigated to interpret inter-individual variations in the metabolism characteristics of losartan. H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-based metabolic profiles were performed on 36 healthy Chinese male volunteers by measuring their pre-dose plasma samples. After oral administration of losartan, the concentrations of losartan and its bioactive metabolite EXP3174 were monitored by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Orthogonal partial least-squares (O-PLS) model was conducted to select potential biomarkers that substantially contributed to the inter-individual variations in the metabolism features via analyzing the ratio of pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters of its metabolite to parent drug. Potential metabolites such as glycine, phosphorylcholine, choline, creatine, creatinine, lactate, citrate, α-glucose, and lipids showed strong correlations with metabolism features of losartan. In addition, the pathway analysis revealed that baseline lipid metabolism, the glycine, serine and threonine pathway, and glycolysis or  metabolism pathway were significantly associated with the ratio of PK parameters of EXP3174 to losartan. Step-wise multiple linear regression (MLR) was constructed to investigate the potential roles of the selected biomarkers in predicting individualized metabolism characteristics of losartan. These results showed that the pre-dose individual metabolic traits may be a useful approach for characterizing individual differences in losartan metabolism characteristics and therefore for expediting personalized dose-setting in further clinical studies.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier .V.

During Reye syndrome most important is deficiency of carnitine and hepatocyte damage. Decreased amount of carnitine impairs the energy function of mitochondria and  as well as production of urea. As a result develops toxic encephalopathy and liver insufficiency. The goal of the research was assessment of efficacy of L-Carnitine, Corvitin and their combination on functional state of liver in experimental model of Reye Syndrome in rats. The study was performed on mature white male Wistar rates with body mass 150-180g. 50 rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (10 rats in each group). The model of Reye syndrome was induced in accordance with A.Vengersky's method. Intraperitoneal administration of 4-pentenoic acid was performed once daily during seven days, the used dosage was 20mg/kg. The treatment of toxic hepatitis was carried with intraperitoneal administration of L-Carnitine 300mg/kg, Corvitine 100mg/kg and concurrent administration of these drugs. Monotherapy with Corvitin and L-Carnitin successfully improved liver function and equally decreased indicators of hepatocyte's cytolyses and increased levels of glucose and urea. The markers of cholestasis was slightly more improved during use of L-Carnitine. Simultaneous use of both drugs was effective in rats with Reye syndrome, indicators of liver damage normalized and herewith, no mortality outcome was observed. The most pronounced hepatoprotective effect of concurrent administration of L-Carnitine and Corvitin may be due to synergic action of these drugs and such regime can be recommended for correction of liver function during Reye syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27941340>Salvianolic Acid  Ameliorates Hyperglycemia and Dyslipidemia in db/db Mice through the AMPK Pathway.</a></h2><p>Salvianolic acid  (Sal ), a major polyphenolic compound of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, has been shown to possess potential antidiabetic activities. However, the action mechanism of SalB in type 2 diabetes has not been investigated extensively. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of Sal  on diabetes-related metabolic changes in a spontaneous model of type 2 diabetes, as well as its potential molecular mechanism.Male C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice were orally treated with Sal  (50 and 100 mg/kg) or metformin (positive drug, 300 mg/kg) for 6 weeks.Both doses of Sal  significantly decreased fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, triglyceride and free fatty acid levels, reduced hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression and improved insulin intolerance in db/db mice. High dose Sal  also significantly improved glucose intolerance, increased hepatic glycolytic gene expression and muscle glycogen content, and ameliorated histopathological alterations of pancreas, similar to metformin. Sal  treatment resulted in increased phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) protein expression in skeletal muscle and liver, increased glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and glycogen synthase protein expressions in skeletal muscle, and increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and phosphorylated acetyl CoA carboxylase (p-ACC) protein expressions in liver.Our data suggest that Sal  displays beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes at least in part via modulation of the AMPK pathway.© 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

In addition, AnxA6 acts as a scaffolding protein for negative regulators of growth factor receptors and their effector pathways in many different cell types. Here we investigated the role of AnxA6 in the regulation of whole body lipid metabolism and insulin-regulated glucose homeostasis. Therefore, wildtype (WT) and AnxA6-knockout (KO) mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 17 weeks. During the course of HFD feeding, AnxA6-KO mice gained less weight compared to controls, which correlated with reduced adiposity. Systemic triglyceride and cholesterol levels of HFD-fed control and AnxA6-KO mice were comparable, with slightly elevated high density lipoprotein (HDL) and reduced triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) levels in AnxA6-KO mice. AnxA6-KO mice displayed a trend towards improved insulin sensitivity in oral glucose and insulin tolerance tests (OGTT, ITT), which correlated with increased insulin-inducible phosphorylation of protein kinase  (Akt) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6) in liver extracts. However, HFD-fed AnxA6-KO mice failed to downregulate hepatic , despite similar insulin levels and insulin signaling activity, as well as expression profiles of insulin-sensitive transcription factors to controls. In addition, increased glycogen storage in livers of HFD- and chow-fed AnxA6-KO animals was observed. Together with an inability to reduce glucose production upon insulin exposure in AnxA6-depleted HuH7 hepatocytes, this implicates AnxA6 contributing to the fine-tuning of hepatic glucose metabolism with potential consequences for the systemic control of glucose in health and disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714432>Systemic oscillator-driven and nutrient-responsive hormonal regulation of daily expression rhythms for gluconeogenic enzyme genes in the mouse liver.</a></h2><p> is de novo glucose synthesis from substrates such as amino acids and is vital when glucose is lacking in the diurnal nutritional fluctuation. Accordingly, genes for hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes exhibit daily expression rhythms, whose detailed regulations under nutritional variations remain elusive. As a first step, we performed general systematic characterization of daily expression profiles of gluconeogenic enzyme genes for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), cytosolic form (Pck1), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), catalytic subunit (G6pc), and tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) (Tat) in the mouse liver. On a standard diet fed ad libitum, mRNA levels of these genes showed robust daily rhythms with a peak or an elevation phase during the late sleep-fasting period in the diurnal feeding/fasting (wake/sleep) cycle. The rhythmicity was preserved in constant darkness, modulated with prolonged fasting, attenuated by Clock mutation, and entrained to varied photoperiods and time-restricted feedings. These results are concordant with the notion that gluconeogenic enzyme genes are under the control of the intrinsic circadian oscillator, which is entrained by the light/dark cycle, and which in turn entrains the feeding/fasting cycle and also drives systemic signaling pathways such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. On the other hand, time-restricted feedings also showed that the ingestion schedule, when separated from the light/dark cycle, can serve as an independent entrainer to daily expression rhythms of gluconeogenic enzyme genes. Moreover, nutritional changes dramatically modified expression profiles of the genes. In addition to prolonged fasting, a high-fat diet and a high-carbohydrate (no-protein) diet caused modification of daily expression rhythms of the genes, with characteristic changes in profiles of glucoregulatory hormones such as corticosterone, glucagon, and insulin, as well as their modulators including ghrelin, leptin, resistin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Remarkably, high-protein (60% casein or soy-protein) diets activated the gluconeogenic enzyme genes atypically during the wake-feeding period, with paradoxical up-regulation of glucagon, which frequently formed correlation networks with other humoral factors. Based on these results, we propose that daily expression rhythms of gluconeogenic enzyme genes are under the control of systemic oscillator-driven and nutrient-responsive hormones.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28799789>Naphtho[1,2-]furan-4,5-dione is a potent anti-MRSA agent against planktonic, biofilm and intracellular bacteria.</a></h2><p>Naphtho[1,2-]furan-4,5-dione (N12D) and naphtho[2,3-]furan-4,9-dione (N23D) are furanonaphthoquinone derivatives from natural resources.

The cells were analyzed using mass spectrometry for proteomics/phosphoproteomics, AlamarBlue assay for mitochondrial activity, time-lapse video for cell migration, quantitative polymerase chain reaction for gene expression, and immunofluorescence for protein expression.Proteomic/phosphoproteomic analysis showed inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases/mammalian target of rapamycin and casein kinase 2 pathways, cell motility-related networks, and multiple metabolic processes, including carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acid, glycolysis/, and the pentose phosphate pathway. Functional analysis demonstrated inhibition of mitochondrial activities, cell migration, and mitosis. Expression of growth promoting insulin-like growth factor 1 and fibrosis-related genes, including transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) and collagen type 1 ɑ2 chain diminished. Protein expression of α-smooth muscle actin, an important regulator of myofibroblast functions, was also suppressed.Low-level blue light exerted suppressive effects on AMDFs, including suppression of mitochondrial activity, metabolism, cell motility, proliferation, TGFβ1 levels, and collagen I production.

In this study, female SD rats were orally treated with 0, 15, or 30 mg/kg·bw AA for 3 weeks. The levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), blood glucose after oral administration of glucose, plasma insulin and hepatic glycogen were measured. The histology of the pancreas was observed, and the transcription of key genes involved in glucose metabolism and insulin signaling in liver were determined. Compared with the control, exposure to 30 mg/kg·bw of AA significantly increased FBG level, reduced hepatic glycogen content and impaired glucose tolerance. Moreover, damaged islets were observed at 15 and 30 mg/kg·bw AA-exposed groups. In addition, AA exposure significantly promoted  and glycogenolysis (up-regulation of pc, g6p and gp) and decreased glycolysis (down-regulation of gck and pfk). Alternations in these processes may be associated with decreased plasma insulin levels and inhibited insulin-regulated IRS/PI3K/Akt/Foxo1 signaling transduction under AA exposure. Overall, our findings demonstrated that AA disrupted glucose homeostasis and elevated FBG level in female rats possibly by interfering with glucose metabolism and hampering the physiological effect of insulin.Copyright © 2019.

Insulin resistance has been identified as the key mechanism linking depression and diabetes. The present study established a rat model of depression complicated by insulin resistance using a 12-week exposure to chronic mild stress (CMS) and investigated the therapeutic effects of curcumin. Sucrose intake tests were used to evaluate depressive-like behaviors, and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance tests (IPITT) were performed to evaluate insulin sensitivity. Serum parameters were detected using commercial kits. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to examine mRNA expression. CMS rats exhibited reduced sucrose consumption, increased serum glucose, insulin, triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), glucagon, leptin, and corticosterone levels, as well as impaired insulin sensitivity. Curcumin upregulated the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and protein kinase  (Akt) in the liver, enhanced insulin sensitivity, and reversed the metabolic abnormalities and depressive-like behaviors mentioned above. Moreover, curcumin increased the hepatic glycogen content by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β and prevented  by inhibiting phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase). These results suggest that curcumin not only exerted antidepressant-like effects, but also reversed the insulin resistance and metabolic abnormalities induced by CMS.

Under these conditions, fuel selection of many peripheral organs is switched, for example, from carbohydrate to fat utilization to spare glucose for milk production and to ensure partitioning of tissue- and dietary-derived nutrients toward the mammary gland. For example, muscle tissue uses nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) but releases lactate and amino acids in a coordinated order, thereby providing precursors for milk synthesis or hepatic . Tissue metabolism and in concert, nutrient partitioning are controlled by the endocrine system involving a reduction in insulin secretion and systemic insulin sensitivity and orchestrated changes in plasma hormones such as insulin, adiponectin, insulin growth factor-I, growth hormone, glucagon, leptin, glucocorticoids, and catecholamines. However, the endocrine system is highly sensitive and responsive to an overload of fatty acids no matter if excessive NEFA supply originates from exogenous or endogenous sources. Feeding a diet containing rumen-protected fat from late lactation to calving and beyond exerts similar negative effects on energy intake, glucose and insulin concentrations as does a high extent of body fat mobilization around parturition in regard to the risk for ketosis and fatty liver development. High plasma NEFA concentrations are thought not to act directly at the brain level, but they increase the energy charge of the liver which is, signaled to the brain to diminish feed intake. Cows differing in fat mobilization during the transition phase differ in their hepatic energy charge, whole body fat oxidation, glucose metabolism, plasma ghrelin, and leptin concentrations and in feed intake several week before parturition. Hence, a high lipid load, no matter if stored, mobilized or fed, affects the endocrine system, metabolism, and feed intake, and increases the risk for metabolic disorders. Future research should focus on a timely parallel increase in feed intake and milk yield during early lactation to reduce the impact of body fat on feed intake, metabolic health, and negative energy balance.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Here we investigated the effects of troxerutin on the enhancement of hepatic  in high-fat diet (HFD)-treated mice and the mechanisms underlying these effects. Mice were divided into four groups: Control group, HFD group, HFD + Troxerutin group, and Troxerutin group. Troxerutin was treated by daily oral administration at doses of 150 mg/kg/day for 20 weeks. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) was used to inhibit endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). Our results showed that troxerutin effectively improved obesity and related metabolic parameters, and liver injuries in HFD-treated mouse. Furthermore, troxerutin significantly attenuated enhancement of hepatic  in HFD-fed mouse. Moreover, troxerutin notably suppressed nuclear factor-κ (NF-κ) p65 transcriptional activation and release of inflammatory cytokines in HFD-treated mouse livers. Mechanismly, troxerutin dramatically decreased Nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) expression, as well as interaction between NOD1/2 with interacting protein-2 (RIP2), by abating oxidative stress-induced ER stress in HFD-treated mouse livers, which was confirmed by TUDCA treatment. These improvement effects of troxerutin on hepatic glucose disorders might be mediated by its anti-obesity effect. In conclusion, troxerutin markedly diminished HFD-induced enhancement of hepatic  via its inhibitory effects on ER stress-mediated NOD activation and consequent inflammation, which might be mediated by its anti-obesity effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28500083>Hepatic thyroid signaling of heat-stressed late pregnant and early lactating cows.</a></h2><p>During the transition between late gestation and early lactation, dairy cows experience severe metabolic stress due to the high energy and nutrient requirements of the fetus and the mammary gland. Additional thermal stress that occurs with rising temperatures during the ongoing climate change has further adverse implications on energy intake, metabolism and welfare. The thyroid hormone (TH)-mediated cellular signaling has a pivotal role in regulation of body temperature, energy intake and metabolic adaptation to heat. To distinguish between energy intake and heat stress-related effects, Holstein cows were first kept at thermoneutrality at 15°C followed by exposure to heat stress (HS) at 28°C or pair-feeding (PF) at 15°C for 6 days, in late pregnancy and again in early lactation. Herein, we focused on hepatic metabolic changes associated with alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis in HS and PF animals. T and T levels dropped with HS or PF; however, in HS animals, this decline was more pronounced. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels remain unaffected, while plasma cholesterol concentrations were lower in HS than PF animals. Hepatic marker genes for TH action (,  and ) decreased after HS and were lower compared to PF cows but only post-partum. Proteomics data revealed reduced hepatic amino acid catabolism ante-partum and a shift toward activated beta-oxidation and  but declined oxidative stress defense post-partum. Thus, liver metabolism of HS and PF cows adapts differently to diminished energy intake both ante-partum and post-partum, and a different TH sensitivity is involved in the regulation of catabolic processes.© 2017 The authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27189362>Trehalose-6-phosphate synthesis controls yeast  downstream and independent of SNF1.</a></h2><p>Trehalose-6-P (T6P), an intermediate of trehalose biosynthesis, was identified as an important regulator of yeast sugar metabolism and signaling. tps1Δ mutants, deficient in T6P synthesis (TPS), are unable to grow on rapidly fermentable medium with uncontrolled influx in glycolysis, depletion of ATP and accumulation of sugar phosphates. However, the exact molecular mechanisms involved are not fully understood. We show that SNF1 deletion restores the tps1Δ growth defect on glucose, suggesting that lack of TPS hampers inactivation of SNF1 or SNF1-regulated processes. In addition to alternative, non-fermentable carbon metabolism, SNF1 controls two major processes: respiration and . The tps1Δ defect appears to be specifically associated with deficient inhibition of , indicating more downstream effects. Consistently, Snf1 dephosphorylation and inactivation on glucose medium are not affected, as confirmed with an in vivo Snf1 activity reporter. Detailed analysis shows that gluconeogenic Pck1 and Fbp1 expression, protein levels and activity are not repressed upon glucose addition to tps1Δ cells, suggesting a link between the metabolic defect and persistent .

In the current study, we determined if gossypol (GSP) reduces postprandial hyperglycemia or enhances glucose uptake; we also investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying those processes  and . GSP strongly and concentration dependently inhibited -glucosidase by functioning as a competitive inhibitor with IC value of 0.67 ± 0.44. GSP activated the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)/protein kinase  (Akt) signaling pathways and enhanced glucose uptake through the translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) into plasma membrane in C2C12 myotubes. Pretreatment with a specific inhibitor attenuated the  effects of GSP. We used a streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model to assess the antidiabetic potential of GSP. Consistent with the  study, a higher dose of GSP (2.5 mg/kg) dramatically decreased the postprandial blood glucose levels associated with the upregulated expressions of GLUT4 and the IRS-1/Akt-mediated signaling cascade in skeletal muscle. GSP treatment also significantly boosted antioxidant enzyme expression and mitigated  in the liver. Collectively, these data imply that GSP has the potential in managing and preventing diabetes by ameliorating glucose uptake and improving glucose homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29291777>Clear cell hepatocellular carcinoma: origin, metabolic traits and fate of glycogenotic clear and ground glass cells.</a></h2><p>Clear cell hepatocellular carcinoma (CCHCC) has hitherto been considered an uncommon, highly differentiated variant of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with a relatively favorable prognosis. CCHCC is composed of mixtures of clear and/or acidophilic ground glass hepatocytes with excessive glycogen and/or fat and shares histology, clinical features and etiology with common HCCs. Studies in animal models of chemical, hormonal and viral hepatocarcinogenesis and observations in patients with chronic liver diseases prone to develop HCC have shown that the majority of HCCs are preceded by, or associated with, focal or diffuse excessive storage of glycogen (glycogenosis) which later may be replaced by fat (lipidosis/steatosis). In ground glass cells, the glycogenosis is accompanied by proliferation of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, which is closely related to glycogen particles and frequently harbors the hepatitis  surface antigen (HBsAg). From the findings in animal models a sequence of changes has been established, commencing with preneoplastic glycogenotic liver lesions, often containing ground glass cells, and progressing to glycogen-poor neoplasms via various intermediate stages, including glycogenotic/lipidotic clear cell foci, clear cell hepatocellular adenomas (CCHCA) rich in glycogen and/or fat, and CCHCC. A similar process seems to take place in humans, with clear cells frequently persisting in CCHCC and steatohepatitic HCC, which presumably represent intermediate stages in the development rather than particular variants of HCC. During the progression of the preneoplastic lesions, the clear and ground glass cells transform into cells characteristic of common HCC. The sequential cellular changes are associated with metabolic aberrations, which start with an activation of the insulin signaling cascade resulting in pre-neoplastic hepatic glycogenosis. The molecular and metabolic changes underlying the glycogenosis/lipidosis are apparently responsible for the dramatic metabolic shift from  to the pentose phosphate pathway and Warburg-type glycolysis, which provide precursors and energy for an ever increasing cell proliferation during progression.Copyright © 2017 The Editorial Board of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Diseases International.

Over the years, important stages of its life cycle, such as the embryo, have been largely ignored by researchers. Tick embryogenesis has been typically described as an energy-consuming process, sustaining cell proliferation, differentiation, and growth. During the embryonic stage of arthropods, there is mobilization of metabolites of maternal origin for the development of organs and tissues of the embryo. Glycogen resynthesis in late embryogenesis is considered as an effective indicator of embryonic integrity. In the cattle tick R.(.

Despite recent advancements in research on tick energy metabolism at the molecular level, the dynamics of nutrient utilization during R. (.) microplus embryogenesis is still poorly understood. The present review aims to describe the regulatory mechanisms of carbohydrate metabolism during maternal-zygotic transition and identify possible new targets for the development of novel drugs and other control measures against R.

Liver tissues were collected from bulls (n = 10) and steers (n = 10) of Korean cattle, and hepatic gene expression levels were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We examined hepatic transcription levels of genes encoding enzymes for irreversible reactions in both  and glycolysis as well as genes encoding enzymes for the utilization of several glucogenic substrates. Correlations between hepatic gene expression and carcass characteristics were performed to understand their associations.Castration increased the mRNA (3.6 fold; p<0.01) and protein levels (1.4 fold; p< 0.05) of pyruvate carboxylase and mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase genes (1.7 fold; p<0.05). Hepatic mRNA levels of genes encoding the glycolysis enzymes were not changed by castration. Castration increased mRNA levels of both lactate dehydrogenase A (1.5 fold; p<0.05) and lactate dehydrogenase  (2.2 fold; p<0.01) genes for lactate utilization. Castration increased mRNA levels of glycerol kinase (2.7 fold; p<0.05) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (1.5 fold; p<0.05) genes for glycerol utilization. Castration also increased mRNA levels of propionyl-CoA carboxylase beta (mitochondrial) (3.5 fold; p<0.01) and acyl-CoA synthetase short chain family member 3 (1.3 fold; p = 0.06) genes for propionate incorporation.Castration increases transcription levels of critical genes coding for enzymes involved in irreversible  reactions from pyruvate to glucose and enzymes responsible for incorporation of glucogenic substrates including lactate, glycerol, and propionate.

Moreover, the levels of miR-27a/ increased in the serum of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our present results showed that inhibition of miR-27a/ expression led to increased hepatic protein levels of G6pase and PEPCK and enhanced hepatic  in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of miR-27a/ suppressed hepatic glucose production and alleviated hyperglycemia in diabetic mice. Further study revealed that FOXO1 was a downstream target of miR-27a/.

Uncovering the genetic architecture of these traits is necessary for improving wheat quality by marker-assisted selection (MAS). In the present study, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed on a collection of 166 bread wheat cultivars to better understand the genetic architecture of flour color-related traits using the wheat 90 and 660 K SNP arrays, and 10 allele-specific markers for known genes influencing these traits. Fifteen, 28, 25, and 32 marker-trait associations (MTAs) for L, a, , and YPC, respectively, were detected, explaining 6.5-20.9% phenotypic variation. Seventy-eight loci were consistent across all four environments. Compared with previous studies, , and the 1B•1R translocation controlling flour color-related traits were confirmed, and four loci were novel. Two and 11 loci explained much more phenotypic variation of a and YPC than phytoene synthase 1 gene (), respectively. Sixteen candidate genes were predicted based on biochemical information and bioinformatics analyses, mainly related to carotenoid biosynthesis and degradation, terpenoid backbone biosynthesis and glycolysis/. The results largely enrich our knowledge of the genetic basis of flour color-related traits in bread wheat and provide valuable markers for wheat quality improvement.

Methionine is an essential amino acid for rainbow trout, and works as a signalling factor in different metabolic pathways. The study investigated the effect of increasing dietary methionine intake on the intermediary metabolism in the liver of juvenile rainbow trout. For this purpose, five diets were formulated with increasing methionine levels from 0.60 to 1.29% dry matter. The diets were fed in excess for six weeks before three sampling campaigns carried out successively to elucidate (i) the hepatic expression of selected genes involved in lipid, glucose and amino acid metabolism; (ii) the postprandial ammonia excretion; and (iii) the postprandial plasma methionine concentrations. The transcript levels of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism (fatty acid synthase, glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 a),  (fructose-1,6-biphosphatase) and amino acid catabolism (alanine amino transferase and glutamate dehydrogenase) were significantly affected by the increase in dietary methionine. Changes in gene expression reflected to some extent the decrease in ammonia excretion (P=0.022) and in the hepatosomatic index (HSI; P<0.001) when dietary methionine increased. Postprandial plasma methionine concentrations correlated positively with the dietary level (P<0.001) at the different sampling points. The study shows that the expression of several genes related to the hepatic intermediary metabolism in rainbow trout responded in a dose-dependent manner to increasing levels of dietary methionine.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

To accomplish that, male Wistar rats were exposed to cold (4°C) for 7 days. Livers were then extracted and used for the determination of glucose and fatty acid oxidation, glycogen content, the expression and content of proteins involved in insulin signaling, as well as in the regulation of  and de novo lipid synthesis. Despite being hyperphagic, cold-acclimated rats displayed normoglycemia with reduced insulinemia, which suggests improved whole-body insulin sensitivity. However, liver protein kinase  (AKT) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) phosphorylations were markedly reduced along with the expressions of the insulin receptor (IR) and its substrates IRS1 and IRS2, whereas glycogen synthase (GS) phosphorylation increased. Thus, major signaling steps of the glycogen synthesis pathway in the liver were inhibited. Furthermore, glucagonemia and hepatic glucose and fatty acid oxidation were increased, whereas liver glycogen content was reduced by cold acclimation. This was accompanied by significantly elevated expressions of the gluconeogenic transcription regulators CRTC2, PGC-1α, and FoxO1, as well as of major gluconeogenic enzymes (G6Pase, FBP1, and PEPCK). Conversely, phosphorylation and contents of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) content were markedly downregulated in livers of cold-acclimated rats. In conclusion, cold acclimation suppressed hepatic glycogen synthesis and promoted profound metabolic changes in the liver so the organ could sustain its ability to regulate whole-body glucose and lipid metabolism under conditions of high-energy demand in thermogenic tissues.© 2018 The Authors.

The branched-chain essential amino acids (BCAAs), viz valine, leucine and isoleucine, have been proposed as biomarkers of an individual's health state, given their influence on protein synthesis and  inhibition.BCAA levels of 141 euthymic/subsyndromal individuals with BD and 141 matched healthy controls (HC) were analysed by high-pressure lipid chromatography and correlated with clinical psychiatric, anthropometric and metabolic parameters.BD and HC did not differ in valine and isoleucine, whereas leucine was significantly lower in BD. Furthermore, correlations were found between BCAAs and anthropometric and glucose metabolism data. All BCAAs correlated with lipid metabolism parameters in females. There were no associations between BCAAs and long-term clinical parameters of BD. A negative correlation was found between valine and Hamilton Depression-Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory II, in male individuals Conclusions: Our results indicate the utility of BCAAs as biomarkers for the current state of health, also in BD. As BD individuals have a high risk for overweight/obesity, in association with comorbid medical conditions (e.g. cardiovascular diseases or insulin resistance), health state markers are urgently required.

Here, we demonstrate that  plays an important role in the process and nutrient-starvation adaptation before the pathogen host invasion. Deletion of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene BcPCK1 in  in Botrytis cinerea, the causative agent of grey mould, resulted in the failure of the ΔBcpck1 mutant conidia to germinate on hard and hydrophobic surface and penetrate host cells in the absence of glucose, reduction in conidiation and slow conidium germination in a nutrient-rich medium. The wild-type and ΔBcpck1 conidia germinate similarly in the presence of glucose (higher concentration) as the sole carbon source. Conidial glucose-content should reach a threshold level to initiate germination and host penetration. Infection structure formation by the mutants displayed a glucose-dependent fashion, which corresponded to the mutant virulence reduction. Exogenous glucose or complementation of BcPCK1 completely rescued all the developmental and virulence defects of the mutants.

In previous work, administration of sodium salicylate (SS) for 7 d led to hypoglycemia in mature dairy cows in early lactation. The purpose of this study was to identify the mode of action underlying this response to SS. Twenty mature (parity 3) cows were assigned alternately at time of calving to either control or SS treatments; the control received a molasses placebo in drinking water, whereas SS received 2.3 g/L of SS with the molasses carrier in drinking water for 7 d after parturition. Blood samples were collected daily. A glucose turnover assay was performed on d 7, followed by liver, muscle, and adipose tissue biopsies. There were no treatment effects on intake of dry matter or water. Tumor necrosis factor α mRNA abundance tended to be decreased by SS in adipose tissue but not in muscle or liver, and plasma haptoglobin and adiponectin concentrations were not altered by treatment. Treatment did not significantly alter plasma glucose or insulin concentrations, but plasma glucagon concentration tended to be increased by SS and the insulin:glucagon molar ratio was significantly decreased. Cows on SS had a tendency for a 25% decrease in glucose turnover rate compared with control cows. However, there were no differences in transcript abundance of pyruvate carboxylase (PC) or glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) in liver or of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in any of the tissues. Finally, SS did not alter insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphorylation in muscle or adipose, but tended to increase phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase and decrease protein kinase  phosphorylation in adipose tissue. These findings may be explained by enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity leading to posttranscriptional suppression of  and adaptive responses to decreased glucose supply in the pancreas and adipose tissue.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

During entry into the so-called alkali phase, in which ammonia signaling is initiated, 2 prominent cell types are formed within the colonies: U cells in upper colony regions, which have a longevity phenotype and activate the expression of a large number of metabolic genes, and L cells in lower regions, which die more quickly and exhibit a starvation phenotype. Here, we performed a detailed analysis of the activities of enzymes of central carbon metabolism in lysates of both cell types and determined several fermentation end products, showing that previously reported expression differences are reflected in the different enzymatic capabilities of each cell type. Hence, U cells, despite being grown on respiratory medium, behave as fermenting cells, whereas L cells rely on respiratory metabolism and possess active . Using a spectrum of different inhibitors, we showed that glycolysis is essential for the formation, and particularly, the survival of U cells.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether pharmacologic activation of AMPK with AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboximide riboside) administration improves peripheral insulin sensitivity in preterm baboons. 11 baboons were delivered prematurely at 125±2 days (67%) gestation. 5 animals were randomized to receive 5 days of continuous AICAR infusion at a dose of 0.5 mg·g-1·day-1. 6 animals were in the placebo group. Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps were performed at 5±2 and 14±2 days of life. Key molecules potentially altered by AICAR (AMPK, GLUT4, ACC, PEPCK, G6PASE, FBP1, and FOXO1), and the insulin signaling molecules: insulin receptor (INSR), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), protein kinase  (AKT), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α) were measured using RT-PCR and western blotting. AICAR infusion did not improve whole body insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in preterm baboons (12.8±2.4 vs 12.4±2.0 mg/(kg·min), p = 0.8, placebo vs AICAR). One animal developed complications during treatment.

Four different smooth muscle tissues (aorta, muscular arteries, intestine, urinary bladder) with a 5-fold difference in maximal shortening velocity were obtained from mice and classified according to expression of the inserted myosin heavy chain (SMHC-). Western blotting and quantitative PCR analyses were used to determine 15 metabolic and 8 cell signaling key components in each tissue. The slow muscle type (aorta) with a 12 times lower SMHC- had 6-fold lower expression of the phosphatase subunit MYPT1, a 7-fold higher expression of Rhokinase 1, and a 3-fold higher expression of the PKC target CPI17, compared to the faster (urinary bladder) smooth muscle. The slow muscle had higher expression of components involved in glucose uptake and glycolysis (type 1 glucose transporter, 3 times; hexokinase, 13 times) and in  (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, 43 times), but lower expression of the metabolic sensing AMP-activated kinase, alpha 2 isoform (5 times). The slow type also had higher expression of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism (hormone-sensitive lipase, 10 times; lipoprotein lipase, 13 times; fatty acid synthase, 6 times; type 2 acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, 8 times). We present a refined division of smooth muscle into muscle types based on the analysis of contractile, metabolic, and signaling components.

Accumulating evidence has implicated important regulatory roles of epigenetic modifications in the occurrence and progression of HCC. In the present study, we analyzed 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) levels in the tumor tissues and paired adjacent peritumor tissues (APTs) from four individual HCC patients using a (hydroxy)methylated DNA immunoprecipitation approach combined with deep sequencing [(h)MeDIP-Seq]. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the 5-mC levels in the promoter regions of 2796 genes and the 5-hmC levels in 507 genes differed significantly between HCC tissues and APTs. These differential genes were grouped into various clusters and pathways and found to be particularly enriched in the 'metabolic pathways' that include 'Glycolysis/', 'Oxidative phosphorylation' and 'Citrate cycle (TCA cycle)', implicating a potential role of metabolic alterations in HCC. Furthermore, 144 genes had both 5-mC and 5-hmC changes in HCC patients, and 10 of them (PCNA, MDM2, STAG1, E2F4, FGF4, FGF19, RHOBTB2, UBE2QL1, DCN and HSP90AA1) were enriched and interconnected in five pathways including the 'Cell cycle', 'Pathway in cancer', 'Ubiquitin mediated proteolysis', 'Melanoma' and 'Prostate cancer' pathways. The genome-wide mapping of 5-mC and 5-hmC in HCC tissues and APTs indicated that both 5-mC and 5-hmC epigenetic modifications play important roles in the regulation of HCC, and there may be some interconnections between them.

Using 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing, it was found that the yak rumen harbored populations showing a higher bacterial diversity compared to Tibetan sheep. The rumen bacterial community in the three ruminant species differed from each other. PICRUSt analysis identified that the pathway involved in nitrogen metabolism was enriched in Tibetan sheep while that related to fatty acid biosynthesis was over-represented in the yak. The methane metabolism pathway was dominant in bacterial populations from the Small Tail Han sheep. Comparisons between freshly collected rumen fluid and populations subjected to consecutive 72 h batch cultures revealed substantial decreases in alpha diversity in populations cultured with NPA. Moreover, the relative abundances of some bacterial taxa changed significantly, with increased abundance of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. In addition, the overall community structure of the bacterial population in the freshly collected ruminal fluid was clearly different than that within populations observed in the 72 h batch cultures likely due to the impact of NPA treatments and the more restrictive growth conditions of the culture medium. In regard to PICRUSt analysis, the methane metabolism pathway became scarce in Tibetan and Small Tail Han sheep, whereas the energy and carbohydrate metabolic pathways such as nitrogen metabolism, ABC transporters and glycolysis/ were found to be maintained across all populations. Results from the present study provide new information on the bacterial and functional composition within ruminal populations adapted to three economically important grazing ruminant species prominent on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The results further reveal that effects of NPA treatment on community structure can have an impact not only the metabolism of NPA but on other digestive functions as well.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

These effects are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Because GR activation in liver and adipose has been implicated in metabolic syndrome (MS), we wanted to determine the role of GR in these tissues in the development of MS. Because GR knockout (KO) mice (whole-body KO) exhibit perinatal lethality due to respiratory failure, we generated tissue-specific (liver or adipose) GRKO mice using cre-lox technology. Real-time PCR analysis of liver mRNA from dexamethasone-treated wildtype (WT) and liver GRKO mice indicated that hepatic GR regulates the expression of key genes involved in  and glycogen metabolism. Interestingly, we have observed that liver-specific deletion of GR resulted in a significant increase in mRNA expression of key genes involved in  and glycogen metabolism in kidney tissue, indicating a compensatory mechanism to maintain glucose homeostasis. We have also observed that GR plays an important role in regulating the mRNA expression of key genes involved in lipid metabolism. Liver GRKO mice demonstrated decreased fat mass and liver glycogen content compared with WT mice administered dexamethasone for 2 weeks. Adipose-specific deletion of GR did not alter glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity of adipose GRKO mice compared with WT mice administrated dexamethasone. This indicates that liver GR might be more important in development of MS in dexamethasone-treated mice, whereas adipose GR plays a little role in these paradigms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29710658>Guava leaf inhibits hepatic  and increases glycogen synthesis via AMPK/ACC signaling pathways in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Psidium guajava (PG) is a short shrub or tree cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. The leaf extract of PG (guava leaf) has been used historically to cure many ailments. However, mechanisms of action of guava leaf in treating diabetes are not fully understood. Effects and underlying mechanisms of guava leaf on  and glycogenesis in hepatocytes, insulin signaling proteins, liver function markers, and lipid profile in streptozotocin (STZ) injected diabetic Wistar rats were investigated within the current study. PG was given orally at the dose of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg .w to diabetic rats for the period of 45 days. The results reveal that oral administration of PG (200 mg/kg .w) has considerably raised the levels of insulin, glycogen, hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphatase dehydrogenase and significant (p < 0.05) belittled hepatic markers, gluconeogenic enzymes, and OGTT fasting blood glucose levels. OGTT has shown least statistical significance between the group 5 (200 mg/kg .w) and group 6 and vital difference between group 5 and group 4 (400 mg/kg). PG has attenuated the triglycerides, total cholesterol, phospholipids, free fatty acid, and LDL levels and raised HDL levels. PG considerably (p < 0.05) activated IRS-1, IRS-2, Akt, p-Akt, PI3K, GLUT2, AMPK, p-AMPK, and p-ACC, which are the key effector molecules of the PI3K/Akt pathway in STZ rats. The results of our study specify that treatment with PG ameliorated glucose-metabolism and lipid profile in STZ evoked diabetic rats; the rationale ought to be the activation of PI3K/Akt, phosphorylation of AMPK pathway in liver and therefore has beneficial anti-diabetic activity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In patients with T2D, reduced blood Mg levels are associated with an increased decline in renal function, independent of glycemic control and hypertension. To study the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon, we investigated the renal effects of hypomagnesemia in high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed mice. In mice fed a low dietary Mg, the HFD resulted in severe hypomagnesemia within 4 wk. Renal or intestinal Mg wasting was not observed after 16 wk on the diets. Despite the absence of urinary or fecal Mg loss, the HFD induced a reduction in the mRNA expression transient receptor potential melastatin type 6 in both the kidney and colon. mRNA expression of distal convoluted tubule (DCT)-specific genes was down-regulated by the LowMg-HFD, indicating atrophy of the DCT. The low dietary Mg resulted in severe HFD-induced proximal tubule phospholipidosis, which was absent in mice on a NormalMg-HFD. This was accompanied by albuminuria, moderate renal damage, and alterations in renal energy metabolism, including enhanced  and cholesterol synthesis. In conclusion, this study shows that hypomagnesemia is a consequence of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Moreover, hypomagnesemia induces major structural changes in the diabetic kidney, including proximal tubular phospholipidosis, providing a novel mechanism for the increased renal decline in patients with hypomagnesemic T2D.-Kurstjens, S., Smeets, ., Overmars-Bos, C., Dijkman, H. ., den Braanker, D.

We propose that proteins that are no longer needed will be recognized and proteolyzed by Clp proteases and thereby recycled. To test this postulation, we analyzed the stability of the glycolytic enzyme GapA and the gluconeogenetic enzyme GapB in the presence and absence of glucose. It turned out that GapA remained rather stable under both glycolytic and gluconeogenetic conditions. In contrast, the gluconeogenetic enzyme GapB was degraded after a shift from malate to glucose (i.e., from  to glycolysis), displaying an estimated half-life of approximately 3 h. Comparative  pulse-chase labeling and immunoprecipitation experiments of the wild-type strain and isogenic mutants identified the ATP-dependent ClpCP protease as the enzyme responsible for the degradation of GapB. However, arginine protein phosphorylation, which was recently described as a general tagging mechanism for protein degradation, did not seem to play a role in GapB proteolysis, because GapB was also degraded in a  mutant, lacking arginine kinase, in the same manner as in the wild type. GapB, the NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphosphate dehydrogenase, is essential for  under gluconeogenetic conditions. However, after a shift to glycolytic conditions, GapB loses its physiological function within the cell and becomes susceptible to degradation, in contrast to GapA, the glycolytic NAD-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which remains stable under glycolytic and gluconeogenetic conditions. Subsequently, GapB is proteolyzed in a ClpCP-dependent manner. According to our data, the arginine kinase McsB is not involved as adaptor protein in this process. ClpCP appears to be in charge in the removal of inoperable enzymes in , which is a strictly regulated process in which the precise recognition mechanism(s) remains to be identified.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28111233>CtBP2 ameliorates palmitate-induced insulin resistance in HepG2 cells through ROS mediated JNK pathway.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress plays a significant role in the development of hepatic insulin resistance, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we discovered that C-terminal-binding protein 2 (CtBP2) level was decreased in insulin resistance. Taking into account the relationship between CtBP family protein (ANGUSTIFOLIA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, we conjectured CtBP2 was involved in insulin resistance through ROS induced stress. In order to verify this hypothesis, we over-expressed CtBP2 in palmitate (PA) treated HepG2 cells. Here, we found that over-expression of CtBP2 ameliorated insulin sensitivity by increasing phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and protein kinase  (AKT). These data suggest that CtBP2 plays a critical role in the development of insulin resistance. Moreover, CtBP2 reversed the effects of PA on ROS level, lipid accumulation, hepatic glucose uptake and . We also found that over-expression of CtBP2 could suppress PA induced c-jun NH2 terminal kinase (JNK) activation. Furthermore, JNK inhibitor SP600125 was shown to promote the effect of CtBP2 on insulin signaling. Thus, we demonstrated that CtBP2 ameliorated PA-induced insulin resistance via ROS-dependent JNK pathway.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

These represent a family of evolutionarily conserved NAD-dependent deacetylases that are well-known critical regulators of metabolism and aging and whose founding member is Sir2 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we investigated the effects of NAM supplementation in the context of yeast chronological aging, the established model for studying aging of postmitotic quiescent mammalian cells. Our data show that NAM supplementation at the diauxic shift results in a phenocopy of chronologically aging sir2Δ cells. In fact, NAM-supplemented cells display the same chronological lifespan extension both in expired medium and extreme Calorie Restriction. Furthermore, NAM allows the cells to push their metabolism toward the same outcomes of sir2Δ cells by elevating the level of the acetylated Pck1. Both these cells have the same metabolic changes that concern not only anabolic pathways such as an increased  but also respiratory activity in terms both of respiratory rate and state of respiration. In particular, they have a higher respiratory reserve capacity and a lower non-phosphorylating respiration that in concert with a low burden of superoxide anions can affect positively chronological aging.Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

Additionally, as largely described, the inhibition of mTOR has a major impact on cellular metabolism by stimulating synthesis of proteins and lipids, inhibiting catabolic processes, such as lysosome biogenesis and autophagy, and controlling cell survival, cytoskeleton organization, lipogenesis, and . All these biological functions are essential to guarantee body homeostasis and survival. Therefore, it is necessary for clinicians and researchers to better understand this complex pathway to ameliorate patients' treatment empathizing therapeutic effects to minimize/avoid toxicities and to propose new valuable research strategies.The aim of this article has been to underline the complexity of the mTOR pathway and to review the recent literature describing the consequences of its inhibition on several cellular functions including (a) protein synthesis, () cell cycle.(c) lipid metabolism, (d) energy metabolism, (e) autophagy, (f) angiogenesis, (g) glucose metabolism, (h) cytoskeleton remodeling, (i) epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and (j) immune cells development and function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27569705>Metabolomic determination of pathogenesis of late-onset preeclampsia.</a></h2><p>Our primary objective was to apply metabolomic pathway analysis of first trimester maternal serum to provide an insight into the pathogenesis of late-onset preeclampsia (late-PE) and thereby identify plausible therapeutic targets for PE.NMR-based metabolomics analysis was performed on 29 cases of late-PE and 55 unaffected controls. In order to achieve sufficient statistical power to perform the pathway analysis, these cases were combined with a group of previously analyzed specimens, 30 late-PE cases and 60 unaffected controls. Specimens from both groups of cases and controls were collected in the same clinical centers during the same time period. In addition, NMR analyses were performed in the same lab and using the same techniques.We identified abnormalities in branch chain amino acids (valine, leucine and isoleucine) and propanoate, glycolysis,  and ketone body metabolic pathways. The results suggest insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, mitochondrial dysfunction and disturbance of energy metabolism, oxidative stress and lipid dysfunction in the pathogenesis of late PE and suggest a potential role for agents that reduce insulin resistance in PE.Branched chain amino acids are known markers of insulin resistance and strongly predict future diabetes development. The analysis provides independent evidence linking insulin resistance and late-PE and suggests a potentially important therapeutic role for pharmacologic agents that reduce insulin resistance for late-PE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29570673>Protective Effects of Gomisin N against Hepatic Cannabinoid Type 1 Receptor-Induced Insulin Resistance and .</a></h2><p>Activation of the hepatic cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R) induces insulin resistance and  via endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, thereby contributing to hyperglycemia. Gomisin N (GN) is a phytochemical derived from . In the current study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of GN on hepatic CB1R-mediated insulin resistance and  in 2-arachidonoylglycerol (AG; an agonist of CB1R)-treated HepG2 cells and in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Treatment with 2-AG induced the expression of ER stress markers, serine/threonine phosphatase , , and ceramide synthesis genes, but reduced the expression of ceramide degradation genes in HepG2 cells. However, GN reversed 2-AG-mediated effects and improved the 2-AG-mediated impairment of insulin signaling. Furthermore, GN inhibited 2-AG-induced intracellular triglyceride accumulation and glucose production in HepG2 cells by downregulation of lipogenesis and  genes, respectively. In vivo, GN administration to HFD obese mice reduced the HFD-induced increase in fasting blood glucose and insulin levels, which was accompanied with downregulation of HFD-induced expression of CB1R, ER stress markers, ceramide synthesis gene, and  genes in the livers of HFD obese mice. These findings demonstrate that GN protects against hepatic CB1-mediated impairment of insulin signaling and , thereby contributing to the amelioration of hyperglycemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26547672>Gallic acid ameliorates hyperglycemia and improves hepatic carbohydrate metabolism in rats fed a high-fructose diet.</a></h2><p>Herein, we investigated the hypoglycemic effect of plant gallic acid (GA) on glucose uptake in an insulin-resistant cell culture model and on hepatic carbohydrate metabolism in rats with a high-fructose diet (HFD)-induced diabetes. Our hypothesis is that GA ameliorates hyperglycemia via alleviating hepatic insulin resistance by suppressing hepatic inflammation and improves abnormal hepatic carbohydrate metabolism by suppressing hepatic  and enhancing the hepatic glycogenesis and glycolysis pathways in HFD-induced diabetic rats. Gallic acid increased glucose uptake activity by 19.2% at a concentration of 6.25 μg/mL in insulin-resistant FL83B mouse hepatocytes. In HFD-induced diabetic rats, GA significantly alleviated hyperglycemia, reduced the values of the area under the curve for glucose in an oral glucose tolerance test, and reduced the scores of the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index. The levels of serum C-peptide and fructosamine and cardiovascular risk index scores were also significantly decreased in HFD rats treated with GA. Moreover, GA up-regulated the expression of hepatic insulin signal transduction-related proteins, including insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate 1, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, Akt/protein kinase , and glucose transporter 2, in HFD rats. Gallic acid also down-regulated the expression of hepatic -related proteins, such as fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, and up-regulated expression of hepatic glycogen synthase and glycolysis-related proteins, including hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and aldolase, in HFD rats.

Long-term GC treatment induces hepatic steatosis and weight gain. GC signaling is coordinated via the GC receptor (GR) GRα, as the GRβ isoform lacks a ligand-binding domain. The roles of the GR isoforms in the regulation of lipid accumulation is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether GRβ inhibits the actions of GCs in the liver, or enhances hepatic lipid accumulation. We show that GRβ expression is increased in adipose and liver tissues in obese high-fat fed mice. Adenovirus-mediated delivery of hepatic GRβ overexpression (GRβ-Ad) resulted in suppression of gluconeogenic genes and hyperglycemia in mice on a regular diet. Furthermore, GRβ-Ad mice had increased hepatic lipid accumulation and serum triglyceride levels possibly due to the activation of NF-κ signaling and increased tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression, indicative of enhanced M1 macrophages and the development of steatosis. Consequently, GRβ-Ad mice had increased glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) activity and reduced hepatic PPARα and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) expression and lower serum FGF21 levels, which are two proteins known to increase during fasting to enhance the burning of fat by activating the β-oxidation pathway. In conclusion, GRβ antagonizes the GC-induced signaling during fasting via GRα and the PPARα-FGF21 axis that reduces fat burning. Furthermore, hepatic GRβ increases inflammation, which leads to hepatic lipid accumulation.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30107223>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms are expressed and active during hypoxia in the white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei.</a></h2><p>Hypoxic zones in marine environments are spreading around the world affecting the survival of many organisms. Marine animals have several strategies to respond to hypoxia, including the regulation of . Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) is a key regulatory enzyme of . The objective of this work was to study two isoforms of PEPCK, one mitochondrial (PEPKC-M) and one cytosolic (PEPCK-C), from the white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei and the response to hypoxia. Both PEPCK isoforms are 72 kDa proteins and have 92% identity at the amino acid level. The mitochondrial isoform has a N-terminal signal peptide for mitochondrial import. Gene expression and enzymatic activity in subcellular fractions were detected in gills, hepatopancreas and muscle in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Expression of PEPCK-C was higher than PEPCK-M in all the tissues and induced in response to hypoxia at 48 h in hepatopancreas, while the enzymatic activity of PEPCK-M was higher than PEPCK-C in gills and hepatopancreas, but not in muscle and also increased in response to hypoxia in hepatopancreas but decreased in gills and muscle. During limiting oxygen conditions, shrimp tissues obtain energy by inducing anaerobic glycolysis, and although  implies energy investment, due to the need to maintain glucose homeostasis, these gluconeogenic enzymes are active with contrasting behaviors in the cytosol and mitochondrial cell compartments and appear to be up-regulated in hepatopancreas indicating this tissue pivotal role in  during the response to hypoxia.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Probiotics and/or prebiotics could be a promising approach to improve insulin sensitivity by favourably modifying the composition of the gut microbial community, reducing intestinal endotoxin concentrations and decreasing energy harvest. The aim of the present review was to investigate the effects of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics (a combination of probiotics and prebiotics) on insulin resistance in human clinical trials and to discuss the potential mechanisms whereby probiotics and prebiotics improve glucose metabolism. The anti-diabetic effects of probiotics include reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines via a NF-κ pathway, reduced intestinal permeability, and lowered oxidative stress. SCFA play a key role in glucose homeostasis through multiple potential mechanisms of action. Activation of G-protein-coupled receptors on L-cells by SCFA promotes the release of glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide YY resulting in increased insulin and decreased glucagon secretion, and suppressed appetite. SCFA can decrease intestinal permeability and decrease circulating endotoxins, lowering inflammation and oxidative stress. SCFA may also have anti-lipolytic activities in adipocytes and improve insulin sensitivity via GLUT4 through the up-regulation of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase signalling in muscle and liver tissues. Resistant starch and synbiotics appear to have favourable anti-diabetic effects. However, there are few human interventions. Further well-designed human clinical studies are required to develop recommendations for the prevention of type 2 diabetes with pro- and prebiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28273963>Benefits of Alcohol on Arsenic Toxicity in Rats.</a></h2><p>It has been demonstrated earlier that exposure to ethanol and/or arsenic compounds (such as sodium arsenite) produces toxic effects as shown by both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Chronic exposure of humans to arsenic through drinking water, pesticides or consumption of alcoholic beverages has produced major health problem and concern in recent years. Water being one of the main ingredients for alcohol formation (beer fermentation process) can lead to contamination with arsenic. Thus, people consuming such alcohol are getting continuously exposed to arsenic compounds as well along with alcohol.The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of alcohol co-administration on arsenic induced changes in carbohydrate metabolic status in adult male albino rats.Adult male albino rats of Wistar strain (weighing~100g) were divided into three groups (n=8 rats/group) including Control or vehicle treated (C), Arsenic treated (As) and Arsenic treated alcohol co-exposed (As+Alc). Treatment with Sodium-arsenite included intra-peritoneal injection consecutively for 14 days at a dose of 5.55 mg/kg (equivalent to 35% of LD50) per day. Absolute alcohol (15% v/v) was fed at a dose of 0.5 ml/100 g body weight per day for five consecutive days from start of the treatment schedule. Distilled water (D/W) was used as vehicle. Blood Glucose (BG) level, levels of glycogen, Pyruvic Acid (PA), Free Amino Acid Nitrogen (FAAN), total protein, Glutamate Oxalate transaminase (GOT) and Glutamate Pyruvate Transaminase (GPT) activity, and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) activity were measured in tissues including liver, kidney and muscle.Treatment with arsenic decreased the levels of BG, liver glycogen and PA, tissue protein and G6Pase activity, GOT activity in liver and muscle, and increased free amino acid content in kidney and muscle, GPT activity in liver and kidney. Alcohol administration to rats co-exposed to arsenic treatment reversed these changes.Thus, it is suggested that combined administration of alcohol with arsenic can result in the suppression of the down-regulating action of arsenic on glucose homeostasis as evidenced by its hypoglycaemic effect and increased  and transamination in liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30423827>Pyruvate Treatment Restores the Effectiveness of Chemotherapeutic Agents in Human Colon Adenocarcinoma and Pleural Mesothelioma Cells.</a></h2><p>Emerging evidence supports the idea that a dysfunction in cell metabolism could sustain a resistant phenotype in cancer cells. As the success of chemotherapeutic agents is often questioned by the occurrence of multidrug resistance (MDR), a multiple cross-resistance towards different anti-cancer drugs represent a major obstacle to cancer treatment. The present study has clarified the involvement of the carbon metabolites in a more aggressive tumor colon adenocarcinoma phenotype and in a chemoresistant mesothelioma, and the role of pyruvate treatment in the reversion of the potentially related resistance. For the first time, we have shown that human colon adenocarcinoma cells (HT29) and its chemoresistant counterpart (HT29-dx) displayed different carbon metabolism: HT29-dx cells had a higher glucose consumption compared to HT29 cells, whereas human malignant mesothelioma (HMM) cells showed a lower glucose consumption compared to HT29 cells, accompanied by a lower pyruvate production and, consequently, a higher production of lactate. When treated with pyruvate, both HT29-dx and HMM cells exhibited a re-established accumulation of doxorubicin and a lower survival ability, a decreased activity of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) and a restored mitochondrial respiratory chain function, improving the effectiveness of the chemotherapeutic agents in these resistant cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31040245>Protease-Mediated Growth of Staphylococcus aureus on Host Proteins Is  Dependent.</a></h2><p> has the ability to cause infections in multiple organ systems, suggesting an ability to rapidly adapt to changing carbon and nitrogen sources.

The mRNA and protein expressions of hepatic glucose transporter 2 (GLUT-2) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) were increased and that of glucokinase (GCK) were decreased in diabetic rats. However, 10% ABO treatment reduced the mRNA and protein expressions of GLUT-2 and PEPCK and elevated the expression of hepatic GCK in diabetic rats. Thus, ABO enhanced hepatic glucose metabolism to decrease blood glucose in diabetic rats. In addition, 10% ABO supplementation increased the expression of phosphorylated protein kinase  (Akt) relative to the total Akt levels in the muscles of diabetic rats, indicating enhanced insulin sensitivity.

In this study, the antidiabetic effect of fenugreek flavonoids was investigated by metabonomics based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). Fenugreek flavonoids were purified using polyamide resin and D101 macroporous adsorption resin, characterized by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, and administered to streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats for 28 days. Pharmacological study results indicated that fenugreek flavonoids exerted a strong antidiabetic effect characterized by significant reduction of fasting blood glucose (P < 0.01), increase in serum insulin level (P < 0.01) and liver glycogen content (P < 0.01), attenuation of weight loss, and improvement of pancreatic islet and kidney conditions. The antidiabetic effect of fenugreek flavonoids was further analyzed by metabonomics. Serum samples of health and diabetic rats treated or not with fenugreek flavonoids were evaluated by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, followed by principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The PCA model revealed significant differences among the animal groups, and OPLS-DA identified fenugreek flavonoids-induced changes of 11 potential biomarkers involved in lipid metabolism (docosahexaenoic acid, arachidonic acid, sphinganine, sphingosine‑1‑phosphate, and lysophosphatidylcholines 20:4, 18:2, 16:0, and 20:2), amino acid metabolism (hippuric acid and tryptophan), and kidney function-related metabolism (2‑phenylethanol glucuronide).

To elucidate the underlying mechanism by which DEHP or MEHP perturbs hepatic glucose homeostasis, we compared the effect of DEHP (0-200 μM) and MEHP (0-200 μM) on glucose metabolism in HepG2 cells. In this study, we found that MEHP can induce more severe impairments in glucose homeostasis than DEHP can; these include increased hepatic  via receptor substrate-1/protein kinase /fork-head box protein O1 (IRS-1/AKT/FOXO1)-mediated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) up-regulation, as well as decreased hepatic glycogen synthesis via glucokinase (GCK) inhibition and IRS-1/AKT/glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β)-mediated glycogen synthase (GYS) inactivation. Additionally, our results demonstrated that retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), an insulin resistance-inducing factor, plays a critical role in the MEHP-induced disorder of glucose homeostasis and the dysfunction of insulin signaling transduction, whereas the deletion of RBP4 by the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) significantly reversed these toxic effects. Although these should be interpreted with caution in view of limited in vivo evidence, the present study provides the first in vitro evidence for potential involvements of RBP4 in disturbance of glucose homeostasis in the MEHP-treated HepG2 cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

To fill this gap, we captured House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) from rural and urban environments and hypothesized that increased access to human refuse in urban areas may significantly alter the gut microbiome and nutritional physiology of Sparrows. While there were no significant differences in circulating triglycerides or free glycerol concentrations between populations, urban birds had significantly greater blood glucose concentrations, which suggests greater circulating glucagon concentrations, accessibility to carbohydrates, and/or higher rates of  in an urban setting. Rural birds had significantly more plasma uric acid, suggesting that they may metabolize more proteins or experience lower inflammation than urban birds. Rural birds also had significantly higher liver free glycerol concentrations, indicating that they metabolize more fat than urban birds. There were no significant differences in the relative abundance of gut microbial taxa at the phyla level between the two populations, but linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) showed that urban House Sparrows were more enriched with class- and order-level microbes from the phylum Proteobacteria, which are implicated in several mammalian intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases. These findings demonstrate that urbanization significantly alters the nutritional physiology and the composition of the gut microbiome of House Sparrows.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In a previous study, we demonstrated oligonol inhibits PTP1B and α-glucosidase related to T2DM. In this study, we examined the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-diabetic effects of oligonol in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells. Glucose uptake was assessed using a fluorescent glucose tracer, 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxyglucose, and the signaling pathway was investigated by western blotting. Oligonol significantly increased insulin-provoked glucose uptake and decreased PTP1B expression, followed by modulation of ERK phosphorylation. In addition, oligonol activated insulin receptor substrate 1 by reducing phosphorylation at serine 307 and increasing that at tyrosine 895, and enhanced the phosphorylations of Akt and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Interestingly, it also reduced the expression of two key enzymes of  (glucose 6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase), attenuated oxidative stress by scavenging/inhibiting peroxynitrite, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and augmented the expression of nuclear factor kappa . These findings suggest oligonol improved the insulin sensitivity of insulin-resistant HepG2 cells by attenuating the insulin signaling blockade and modulating glucose uptake and production. Furthermore, oligonol attenuated ROS-related inflammation and prevented oxidative damage in our in vitro model of type 2 diabetes. These result indicate oligonol has promising potential as a treatment for T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29207074>Establishment of a novel hepatic steatosis cell model by Cas9/sgRNA-mediated DGKθ gene knockout.</a></h2><p>To investigate the role of diacylglycerol kinase θ (DGKθ) in lipid metabolism and insulin resistance, the present study generated an in vitro hepatic steatosis cell model by knockout of the DGKθ gene in liver cancer cell line HepG2 using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The cell line was characterized by Oil Red O staining and shown to exhibit increased intracellular lipid accumulation, compared with that in wild‑type liver cancer cell line HepG2. The gene expression levels of signaling proteins in pathways involved in lipid metabolism, insulin resistance and  were also examined. The DGKθ‑knockout HepG2 cells showed increased mRNA and protein expression levels of lipid synthesis‑related genes, fatty acid synthase, peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor‑γ and sterol regulatory element‑binding protein‑1c, and decreased expression levels of the lipolysis‑related gene, carnitine palmitoyltransferase1A. These changes may account for the increased intracellular lipid content of this cell line. The DGKθ‑knockout HepG2 cells also exhibited an increased phosphorylation level of protein kinase Cε and decreased phosphorylation levels of insulin receptor substrate 1, mechanistic target of rapamycin and protein kinase  (also known as Akt). These changes have been reported to mediate insulin resistance. Taken together, an in vitro hepatic steatosis cell model was established in the present study, providing a valuable tool for understanding the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and associated insulin resistance, and for developing treatment strategies for this disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612672>Stress biomarkers and proteomics alteration to thermal stress in ruminants: A review.</a></h2><p>Heat stress may adversely affect physiochemical and immune responses of livestock and alter biological functions. The comfort or thermoneutral zone for livestock, which has long been a subject of research, mainly depends on species, breed, and health. Heat stress is associated with impaired livestock productivity due to reductions in feed intake, growth rates and immunity and changes in blood constituents and biological pathways. In ruminants, elevated temperatures have deleterious consequences on protein synthesis. Exposure of ruminant animals to elevated temperatures may induce release of heat shock proteins (HSPs); HSPs usually enter the blood circulation during tissue damage and causes cell necrosis or death. Additionally, hyperthermia is associated with augmented production of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause protein degradation and further decrease protein synthesis by preventing protein translation. Moreover, it has been suggested that high environmental temperatures lead to increased inflammatory signalling in tissues via activation of the nuclear factor kappa  (NF-κ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) pathways as well as via alteration of skin colour gene (melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) and premelanosome protein (PMEL)) expression. Previous proteomics analyses have suggested that heat stress can reduce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, alter  precursor supply, and induce lipid accumulation in the liver with subsequent disturbance of liver structure. This review focuses on the scientific evidence regarding the impact of heat stress on immune and inflammatory responses, antioxidant status, stress biomarkers, skin colour gene (PMEL and MC1R) expression and proteomic profiles in ruminants.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Extended fasting is associated with increased β-oxidation of fatty acids and reduced oxidation of glucose to minimize commitment of body protein to . However, the metabolic strategies used to sustain extended fasts simultaneous with high rates of energy expenditure are not well understood. Studies in fasting adult female and weanling northern elephant seals (NES) have revealed high rates of endogenous glucose production (EGP) under constraints of high nutrient demand for lactation or development but relatively low rates of metabolism. These studies revealed low rates of glucose oxidation and high rates of glucose recycling through the Cori cycle. We measured rates of glucose flux in fasting adult male NES to assess how significantly longer fasting durations, higher metabolic rates, and greater rates of muscular activity affect glucose kinetics. We measured glucose turnover in 18 adult males using the clearance of [6-H] glucose during breeding and molting. Adult male NES maintain high rates of EGP across extended fasts. EGP greatly exceeded estimated needs for glucose-dependent tissues, varied directly with plasma insulin and lactate concentrations, and was inversely related to plasma ketoacid concentrations. Together, these findings suggest that high rates of glucose production and recycling during breeding maintain high blood glucose levels to support glucose-dependent tissues while minimizing production of ketoacids and commitment of protein stores to glucose production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29390242>[Severe lactic acidosis requiring continuos haemodiafiltration in a young patient with unrecognized metabolic abnormality.

The pathogenesis of LA involves hypoxic causes (type A) and non-hypoxic (type ), often coexisting. Identification and removal of the trigger are mandatory in the therapeutic management of LA. The case: A 38 years-old male patient entered the Emergency Ward for dyspnea, fever, vomiting and hyporexia. An important respiratory distress with hyperventilation due to severe LA was found, together with severe hypoglicemia, without renal impairment. Past medical history unremarkable, except for reported episodic hypoglicemia in the childhood, with fructose "intolerance", without any other data. No evidence of intoxications, septic shock or significant cytolysis. No drugs causing LA. The patient underwent orotracheal intubation, glucose infusion, and continuous haemodiafiltration for 36-hrs. A rapid general improvement was obtained with stabilization of acid-base balance. A diagnosis of fructose-1,6-diphosphatase deficiency was made. It is an autosomical recessive  abnormality, with recurrent episodes of hypoglicemia and lactic acidosis after fasting, potentially lethal. The therapy is based on avoiding prolonged fasts, glucose infusion, and a specific diet, rich in glucose without fructose intake.The presence of not-otherwise-explained lactic acidosis in young patients has to place the suspect of an underlying and unknown metabolic derangement; in these cases, the involvement of the nephrologist appears to be pivotal for the differential diagnosis of the abnormalities of the acid-base balance, and for setting the best treatment.Copyright by Società Italiana di Nefrologia SIN, Rome, Italy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609623>Gymnemic Acid Ameliorate Hyperglycemia Through PI3K/AKT and AMPK Mediated Signaling Pathway in T2DM Rats.</a></h2><p>Gymnemic acid (GA) isolated from gymnema sylvestre (Retz.) Schult has been shown to display anti-diabetic activity, however the molecular mechanisms governing these effects are unclear. In this study, GA (40, 80 mg/kg/day) was evaluated by type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats to explore its hypoglycemic activity and underlying mechanisms of action. The results indicated that GA decreased fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentrations by 26.7 %, and lowered insulin concentrations by 16.1 % after oral administration of GA at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks in T2DM rats. Our data showed that RT-PCR and Western blot analysis indicated that GA up-regulated the expression of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and glycogen synthesis (GS), promoted the phosphorylation of protein kinase  (Akt), while down-regulated the expression of glycogen synthesis kinase-3β (GSK-3β) in T2DM rats. In addition, key proteins involved in AMPK-mediated  (such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy kinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase)) were down-regulated in GA-treated T2DM rats. In summary, the hypoglycemic mechanisms of GA may be related to promoting insulin signal transduction and activating PI3K/Akt and AMPK-mediated signaling pathway in T2DM rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27609066>The oncoprotein HBXIP suppresses  through modulating PCK1 to enhance the growth of hepatoma cells.</a></h2><p>Hepatitis  X-interacting protein (HBXIP) as an oncoprotein plays crucial roles in the development of cancer, involving glucose metabolism reprogramming. In this study, we are interested in whether the oncoprotein HBXIP is involved in the modulation of  in liver cancer. Here, we showed that the expression level of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1), a key enzyme of , was lower in clinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues than that in normal tissues. Mechanistically, HBXIP inhibited the expression of PCK1 through down-regulating transcription factor FOXO1 in hepatoma cells, and up-regulated miR-135a targeting the 3'UTR of FOXO1 mRNA in the cells. In addition, HBXIP increased the phosphorylation levels of FOXO1 protein by activating PI3K/Akt pathway, leading to the export of FOXO1 from nucleus to cytoplasm. Strikingly, over-expression of PCK1 could abolish the HBXIP-promoted growth of hepatoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we conclude that the oncoprotein HBXIP is able to depress the  through suppressing PCK1 to promote hepatocarcinogenesis, involving miR-135a/FOXO1 axis and PI3K/Akt/p-FOXO1 pathway.

Articles were initially screened according to their title and abstract; careful evaluation of the full manuscripts was then used to identify relevant articles.The higher satiety exerted by high-protein diets is generated through increments in anorexigenic, as well as decrements in orexigenic hormones. Improvements in muscle mass are achieved by activation of muscle protein synthesis acting through the mTOR pathway. High thermic effect of food is caused due to necessary deamination, , and urea synthesis caused by high-protein diets. Interestingly, high-protein diets in both hypo- and normocaloric conditions have shown to improve body composition, whereas in combination with hypercaloric conditions does not seem to increase fat mass, when the excess energy comes from protein.High protein diets effectively improve body composition by acting through different pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31329314>Ventromedial hypothalamus glucose-inhibited neurones: A role in glucose and energy homeostasis?</a></h2><p>The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) plays a complex role in glucose and energy homeostasis. The VMH is necessary for the counter-regulatory response to hypoglycaemia (CRR) that increases hepatic  to restore euglycaemia. On the other hand, the VMH also restrains hepatic glucose production during euglycaemia and stimulates peripheral glucose uptake. The VMH is also important for the ability of oestrogen to increase energy expenditure. This latter function is mediated by VMH modulation of the lateral/perifornical hypothalamic area (lateral/perifornical hypothalamus) orexin neurones. Activation of VMH AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is necessary for the CRR. By contrast, VMH AMPK inhibition favours decreased basal glucose levels and is required for oestrogen to increase energy expenditure. Specialised VMH glucose-sensing neurones confer the ability to sense and respond to changes in blood glucose levels. Glucose-excited (GE) neurones increase and glucose-inhibited (GI) neurones decrease their activity as glucose levels rise. VMH GI neurones, in particular, appear to be important in the CRR, although a role for GE neurones cannot be discounted. AMPK mediates glucose sensing in VMH GI neurones suggesting that, although activation of these neurones is important for the CRR, it is necessary to silence them to lower basal glucose levels and enable oestrogen to increase energy expenditure. In support of this, we found that oestrogen reduces activation of VMH GI neurones in low glucose by inhibiting AMPK. In this review, we present the evidence underlying the role of the VMH in glucose and energy homeostasis. We then discuss the role of VMH glucose-sensing neurones in mediating these effects, with a strong emphasis on oestrogenic regulation of glucose sensing and how this may affect glucose and energy homeostasis.© 2019 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31099309>Is air pollution a potential cause of neuronal injury?</a></h2><p>: Fine particle pollution, including diesel exhaust particles (DEP), is a well-recognized and significant threat to public health. Cerebrovascular disease has been shown to be among the pathologies produced by fine particle exposure, and is thought to arise in this context through oxidative and inflammatory mechanisms. The manner by which these mechanisms interface with normal cerebral metabolism in their promotion of cerebrovascular pathogenesis, however, remains to be elucidated. Recent evidence has emerged that implicates a new pathway in post-stroke oxidative injury: . Therefore, we investigated whether diesel exhaust particle (DEP)-mediated oxidative injury to brain cells was associated with upregulation of the gluconeogenic pathway. : Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in complete Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM)/F12 at 37°C.

The aim of this study was to determine the therapeutic effect of ethanolic extract (EE) from the green cocoon sericin layer of silkworm  on mice with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its hypoglycaemic mechanisms. The results showed that oral EE for 7 weeks had significant ameliorative effects on all the biochemical parameters studied . The levels of oral glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance were significantly improved. The hypoglycaemic rate in the 350 mg kg high dosage group was 39.38%. The levels of nuclear factor kappa  (NFκ), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in the high dosage EE-treated group were significantly reduced, while activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were obviously increased. The islet area and the number of insulin-positive beta cells increased significantly in the high dose group. Furthermore, expression levels of insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrate (IRS), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), p-Akt and phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (p-GSK3β) involved in insulin signalling were increased. Adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) also were activated to regulate glucose metabolism in EE-treated groups. The levels of glucose 6-phosphatase (G6pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) decreased, while the glucokinase (GK) level increased to promote glycolysis.

Our aim was to unravel these mechanisms using FL-N/35 transgenic mice expressing the full HCV ORF. We observed that these mice displayed glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. We also found that Glut-2 membrane expression was reduced in FL-N/35 mice and that hepatocyte glucose uptake was perturbed, partly accounting for the HCV-induced glucose intolerance in these mice. Early steps of the hepatic insulin signaling pathway, from IRS2 to PDK1 phosphorylation, were constitutively impaired in FL-N/35 primary hepatocytes via deregulation of TNFα/SOCS3. Higher hepatic glucose production was observed in the HCV mice, despite higher fasting insulinemia, concomitant with decreased expression of hepatic gluconeogenic genes. Akt kinase activity was higher in HCV mice than in WT mice, but Akt-dependent phosphorylation of the forkhead transcription factor FoxO1 at serine 256, which triggers its nuclear exclusion, was lower in HCV mouse livers. These findings indicate an uncoupling of the canonical Akt/FoxO1 pathway in HCV protein-expressing hepatocytes. Thus, the expression of HCV proteins in the liver is sufficient to induce insulin resistance by impairing insulin signaling and glucose uptake. In conclusion, we observed a complete set of events leading to a prediabetic state in HCV-transgenic mice, providing a valuable mechanistic explanation for HCV-induced diabetes in humans.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613531>Biotin Deficiency.</a></h2><p>Biotin (vitamin H or vitamin B7) is a -complex vitamin that acts as an essential coenzyme for five carboxylases: pyruvate carboxylase, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, propionyl-CoA carboxylase, and coenzyme for acetyl-CoA carboxylases 1 and 2.[1][2][3][4] These carboxylases help in several chemical processes in the cell, including , amino acid metabolism, and fatty acid synthesis.[1][3] The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine recommends a daily dietary intake of 30 mcg/day, for the maintenance of good health.

In obese diabetic mice, FAM3C expression was reduced in the liver, and hepatic FAM3C restoration improved insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and fatty liver. FAM3C overexpression increased the expression of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), calmodulin (CaM), and phosphorylated protein kinase  (Akt) and reduced that of gluconeogenic and lipogenic genes in diabetic mouse livers with the suppression of  and lipid deposition. In cultured hepatocytes, FAM3C overexpression upregulated HSF1 expression, which elevated CaM protein level by inducing CALM1 transcription to activate Akt in a Ca- and insulin-independent manner.

A metabolic pathway may switch to another pathway in accordance with the current state of parameters in both normal and cancer cells. Here, most of the parameter values are unknown to us. A fuzzy logic controller (FLC) has been developed here for the purpose of modeling metabolic networks by approximating the reasons for the behaviour of a system and applying expert knowledge to track switching between metabolic pathways. The simulation results can track the switching between glycolysis and , as well as glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways (PPP) in normal cells. Unlike normal cells, pyruvate kinase (M2 isoform) (PKM2) switches alternatively between its two oligomeric forms, i.e. an active tetramer and a relatively low activity dimer, in cancer cells. Besides, there is a coordination among PKM2 switching and enzymes catalyzing PPP. These phenomena help cancer cells to maintain their high energy demand and macromolecular synthesis. However, the reduction of initial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to a very low concentration, decreasing initial glucose uptake, destroying coordination between glycolysis and PPP, and replacement of PKM2 by its relatively inactive oligomeric form (dimer) or inhibition of the translation of PKM2 may destabilize the mutated control mechanism of the mammalian central carbon metabolic (CCM) pathway in cancer cells.

The best-characterized brucellae infect domestic livestock, behaving as stealthy facultative intracellular parasites. This stealthiness depends on envelope molecules with reduced pathogen-associated molecular patterns, as revealed by the low lethality and ability to persist in mice of these bacteria. Infected cells are often engorged with brucellae without signs of distress, suggesting that stealthiness could also reflect an adaptation of the parasite metabolism to use local nutrients without harming the cell. To investigate this, we compared key metabolic abilities of  2308 Wisconsin (2308W), a cattle biovar 1 virulent strain, and  513, the reference strain of the ancestral biovar 5 found in wild rodents.  513 used a larger number of C substrates and showed faster growth rates , two features similar to those of , a species phylogenomically close to  biovar 5 that infects voles.

Mutant analyses showed that  513 and  2308W were similar in that both depend on phosphoenolpyruvate synthesis for virulence but not on the classical gluconeogenic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatases Fbp-GlpX or on isocitrate lyase (AceA). However,  513 used pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PpdK) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PckA) for phosphoenolpyruvate synthesis  while  2308W used only PpdK. Moreover, whereas PpdK dysfunction causes attenuation of  2308W in mice, in , 513 attenuation occurred only in the double PckA-PpdK mutant. Also contrary to what occurs in  2308, a  513 malic enzyme (Mae) mutant was not attenuated, and this independence of Mae and the role of PpdK was confirmed by the lack of attenuation of a double Mae-PckA mutant. Altogether, these results decouple fast growth rates from enhanced mouse lethality in the brucellae and suggest that an Fbp-GlpX-independent gluconeogenic mechanism is ancestral in this group and show differences in central C metabolic steps that may reflect a progressive adaptation to intracellular growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27349515>In vitro studies on the pleotropic antidiabetic effects of zinc oxide nanoparticles.</a></h2><p>Our earlier study demonstrated antidiabetic activity of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZON) in diabetic rats.

However, the pathogenesis of RA is multi-factorial and to a large degree, remains unknown. Danggui Sini decoction (DSD), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, has been widely used as a remedy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in recent years. In our study, H-nuclear magnetic resonance (H NMR) based metabolomics analysis of 7 potential biomarkers, including taurine (1), urea (2), betaine (3), pyruvate (4), hippurate (5), succinate (6) and acetone (7) was performed to investigate the progression of RA and assess the efficacy of DSD in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats. According to pathway analysis using identified metabolites and correlation construction, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, gut microbiota metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, glycolysis/, the citrate cycle (TCA cycle) and lipid metabolism were recognized as being the most influenced metabolic pathways associated with RA. As a result, deviations of metabolites 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 in CIA rats were improved by DSD, which suggested that DSD mediated the abnormal metabolic pathways synergistically. In summary, the efficacy and its underlying therapeutic mechanisms of DSD on RA were systematically investigated and expect to provide a new insight in relevant studies of other TCM formulas.Copyright © 2017.

Three isonitrogenous (46% crude protein) and isolipidic (13% crude lipid) experimental diets were designed, with 100% fish oil (FO), 50% fish oil and 50% soybean oil (FS) and 100% soybean oil (SO), respectively. After a 12-week growth trial, the results showed that compared with FO group, contents n-6 PUFAs increased while the n-3 PUFAs decreased significantly both in liver and muscle in FS and SO groups. Concentrations of blood glucose, leptin, free fatty acid and total triglyceride reached the highest values in SO group, while blood insulin showed no significant difference among all groups. The gene expressions of insulin receptor substrate-2, glucose-6-phosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fatty acid synthetase, and lipoprotein lipase increased, and the insulin receptor substrate-1, phosphotidylinsositol-3-kinase (PI3K), hexokinase, glycogen synthetase and glucose transporter 2 in liver decreased significantly in SO group. Meanwhile, the phosphorylation of protein kinase  (AKT) also decreased significantly in this group. These results suggested that high level of dietary soybean oil depressed PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and then affected glucose and lipid metabolism by , gluconeogenesis, glucose transportation, glycogenesis and lipogenesis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The consideration of different omics levels allows elucidating the black box of phenotype expression. Metabolite and protein profiling was applied in Musculus longissimus dorsi samples of 97 Duroc × Pietrain pigs. In total, 126 and 35 annotated metabolites and proteins were quantified, respectively. In addition, all animals were genotyped with the porcine 60 k Illumina beadchip. An enrichment analysis resulted in 10 pathways, amongst others, sphingolipid metabolism and glycolysis/, with significant influence on drip loss. Drip loss and 22 metabolic components were analyzed as intermediate phenotypes within a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We detected significantly associated genetic markers and candidate genes for drip loss and for most of the metabolic components. On chromosome 18, a region with promising candidate genes was identified based on SNPs associated with drip loss, the protein "phosphoglycerate mutase 2" and the metabolite glycine. We hypothesize that association studies based on intermediate phenotypes are able to provide comprehensive insights in the genetic variation of genes directly involved in the metabolism of performance traits.

Herein, comparative metabolomics was adopted to analyze the variations in the hemolymph metabolites of different resistant silkworm strains following BmNPV inoculation using a H NMR method. Trehalose, as an instant source of energy, plays a crucial role in the response to pathogen infections in insects. The level of trehalose was persistently upregulated in the hemolymph of the resistant silkworm strain YeA following infection with BmNPV, compared to that of the susceptible strain YeB, indicating that trehalose metabolism plays a vital role in the response to BmNPV infection. The significant upregulation of TCA cycle relevant metabolites, including malate, fumarate, citrate, succinate, and α-ketoglutarate, was identified at 0 h, 12 h, 48 h, and 96 h post-infection in YeA hemolymph, whereas a significant upregulation in YeB hemolymph was only detected at an early stage of infection (0 h-24 h). The expression level of selected key metabolic enzymes, determined using RT-qPCR, validated the differences in trehalose and TCA cycle relevant metabolite levels. The variations in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) pathway relevant metabolites in resistant silkworm strains following BmNPV infection showed a regular undulation at different times after infection. A significant accumulation of phenylalanine and tyrosine was observed in YeA following BmNPV infection compared to YeB. The glycolysis and  pathways showed a relatively low activity in YeA following BmNPV infection. Moreover, the levels of other metabolites related to fat metabolism, transamination, energy metabolism, and glycometabolism, such as glycine, threonine, glutamine, and glutamate, were unstable in the two silkworm strains following BmNPV infection. Thus, our study provides an overview of the metabolic response of the silkworm in response to BmNPV infection, which lays the foundation for clarifying the mechanism of silkworm resistance to BmNPV infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, only a minor fraction of sRNAs is well characterized with respect to the spectra of their targets, conditional expression profiles and actual mechanisms they use to regulate gene expression to control particular biological pathways. To learn more about the specific contribution of sRNAs to the global regulatory network controlling the Escherichia coli central carbon metabolism (CCM), we employed microarray analysis and compared transcriptome profiles of E. coli cells grown on two alternative minimal media supplemented with either pyruvate or glucose, respectively. Microarray analysis revealed that utilization of these alternative carbon sources led to profound differences in gene expression affecting all major gene clusters associated with CCM as well as expression of several known (CyaR, RyhB, GcvB and RyeA) and putative (C0652) sRNAs. To assess the impact of transcriptional reprogramming of gene expression on E. coli protein abundance, we also employed two-dimensional protein gel electrophoresis. Our experimental data made it possible to determine the major pathways for pyruvate assimilation when it is used as a sole carbon source and reveal the impact of other key processes (i.e., energy production, molecular transport and cell resistance to stress) associated with the CCM in E. coli. Moreover, some of these processes were apparently controlled by GcvB, RyhB and CyaR at the post-transcriptional level, thus indicating the complexity and interconnection of the regulatory networks that control CCM in bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30385414>Cytological and iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analyses of hau CMS in Brassica napus L.</a></h2><p>Hau cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a new type of CMS that was originally identified in Brassica juncea and subsequently transferred to . napus and . rapa. To further elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying hau CMS in . napus, semithin section analysis and iTRAQ-based differential proteomic analysis were performed to compare the hau CMS and its maintainer line. Cytological analysis revealed that abnormal anther development in the hau CMS line was arrested during the differentiation of stamen archesporial cells. qRT-PCR analysis showed that the sterility gene orf288 was expressed at substantially higher levels in CMS anthers than in anthers with restored fertility. In comparison with the maintainer line, a total of 186 differentially abundant proteins were identified in the CMS line, 58 of which exhibited increased accumulation and 128 exhibited decreased accumulation. Bioinformatics analysis showed that proteins involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolism, such as those involved in oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis/ and pyruvate metabolism, exhibited decreased accumulation in the hau CMS line, whereas those involved in oxidative stress, antagonism of cell death and protein processing exhibited increased accumulation in the hau CMS line, indicating the potential roles of carbohydrate metabolism and energy supply in the regulation of hau anther abortion. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is one of the most efficient ways to produce hybrid seeds in crops. CMS is mainly caused by mitochondrial mutation and has been an important model for investigation of cytoplasmic and nuclear interactions in various plant species. Hau is a new type of CMS line in Brassica with completely abortive anthers. Although studies have been conducted to identify the key genes associated with CMS, the molecular mechanisms underlying hau CMS remain unclear. In this study, cytological, molecular, and proteomic approaches were used to reveal the mechanism underlying hau CMS in . napus. Based on a comparison of the protein expression profiles of the hau CMS line and its maintainer line to elucidate the mechanisms underlying hau CMS, a potential protein regulatory network is proposed herein.

We investigated whether nutritional recovery on a soybean flour diet alters hepatic  in the adult offspring of rats deprived of protein during pregnancy and lactation. Male rats from mothers that were fed either 17% (C) or 6% (L) protein during pregnancy and lactation were maintained on a 17% casein (CC, n = 16 and LC, n = 17), 17% soybean flour (CS, n = 10 and LS, n = 10), or 6% casein (LL, n = 10) diet after weaning.

Dietary methionine restriction (MR) improves insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis in individuals with normal birth weight (NBW). This study investigated the effects of MR on plasma glucose concentration and hepatic and muscle glucose metabolism in pigs with IUGR. Thirty female NBW and 60 same-sex spontaneous IUGR piglets (Landrace × Yorkshire) were selected. After weaning (day 21), the piglets were fed diets with adequate methionine (NBW-CON and IUGR-CON) or 30% less methionine (IUGR-MR) ( = 6). At day 180, 1 pig with a body weight near the mean of each replication was selected for biochemical analysis. The IUGR-CON group showed 41.6%, 68.6%, and 67.1% higher plasma glucose concentration, hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity, and glucose-6-phosphatase activity, respectively, than the NBW-CON group ( < 0.05). Muscle glycogen content and glycogen synthase activity were 36.9% and 38.8% lower, respectively, in the IUGR-CON than the NBW-CON group ( < 0.05), respectively, and there was decreased hepatic and muscle protein kinase  phosphorylation in the IUGR-CON group ( < 0.05). Compared with the IUGR-CON pigs, the IUGR-MR pigs had 28.7% lower plasma glucose concentrations ( < 0.05), which were similar to those of the NBW-CON pigs ( ≥ 0.05). The hepatic glycogen content and glycogen synthase activity of the IUGR-MR pigs were 62.9% and 50.8% higher than those of the IUGR-CON pigs ( < 0.05) and 53.5% and 84.3% higher than the NBW-CON pigs ( < 0.05), respectively. The IUGR-MR pigs' hepatic and muscle protein kinase  phosphorylation was higher than that of the IUGR-CON pigs ( < 0.05) and similar to that of the NBW-CON pigs ( ≥ 0.05).

Type 2 diabetes, which is the primary cause of hyperglycemia, results from an inability of insulin to signal glycolysis and . Our previous study showed that double knockout of insulin receptor a ( insra) and  ( insrb) caused β-cell hyperplasia and lethality from 5 to 16 days postfertilization (dpf) (Yang BY, Zhai G, Gong YL, Su JZ, Han D, Yin Z, Xie SQ. Sci Bull (Beijing) 62: 486-492, 2017). In this study, we characterized the physiological roles of Insra and Insrb, in somatic growth and fueling metabolism, respectively. A high-carbohydrate diet was provided for insulin receptor knockout zebrafish from 60 to 120 dpf to investigate phenotype inducement and amplification. We observed hyperglycemia in both insra-/- fish and insrb-/- fish. Impaired growth hormone signaling, increased visceral adiposity, and fatty liver were detected in insrb-/- fish, which are phenotypes similar to the lipodystrophy observed in mammals. More importantly, significantly diminished protein levels of P-PPARα, P-STAT5, and IGF-1 were also observed in insrb-/- fish. In insra-/- fish, we observed increased protein content and decreased lipid content of the whole body. Taken together, although Insra and Insrb show overlapping roles in mediating glucose metabolism through the insulin-signaling pathway, Insrb is more prone to promoting lipid catabolism and protein synthesis through activation of the growth hormone-signaling pathway, whereas Insra primarily acts to promote lipid synthesis via glucose utilization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28368310>Role of the Enterocyte in Fructose-Induced Hypertriglyceridaemia.</a></h2><p>Dietary fructose has been linked to an increased post-prandial triglyceride (TG) level; which is an established independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although much research has focused on the effects of fructose consumption on liver-derived very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL); emerging evidence also suggests that fructose may raise post-prandial TG levels by affecting the metabolism of enterocytes of the small intestine. Enterocytes have become well recognised for their ability to transiently store lipids following a meal and to thus control post-prandial TG levels according to the rate of chylomicron (CM) lipoprotein synthesis and secretion. The influence of fructose consumption on several aspects of enterocyte lipid metabolism are discussed; including de novo lipogenesis; apolipoprotein B48 and CM-TG production; based on the findings of animal and human isotopic tracer studies. Methodological issues affecting the interpretation of fructose studies conducted to date are highlighted; including the accurate separation of CM and VLDL.

To investigate this question, we transferred caecal microbiota from either obese or lean mice to antibiotic-free, conventional wild-type mice. We found that transferring obese-mouse gut microbiota to mice on normal chow (NC) acutely reduces markers of hepatic  with decreased hepatic PEPCK activity, compared to non-inoculated mice, a phenotypic trait blunted in conventional NOD2 KO mice. Furthermore, transferring of obese-mouse microbiota changes both the gut microbiota and the microbiome of recipient mice. We also found that transferring obese gut microbiota to NC-fed mice then fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) acutely impacts hepatic metabolism and prevents HFD-increased hepatic  compared to non-inoculated mice. Moreover, the recipient mice exhibit reduced hepatic PEPCK and G6Pase activity, fed glycaemia and adiposity. Conversely, transfer of lean-mouse microbiota does not affect markers of hepatic . Our findings provide a new perspective on gut microbiota dysbiosis, potentially useful to better understand the aetiology of metabolic diseases.© 2017 The Authors.

In order to understand the complex interplay between HBV and hepatic metabolism in greater depth, we systematically reviewed these alterations in different metabolic signaling pathways due to HBV infection. HBV infection interfered with most aspects of hepatic metabolic responses, including glucose, lipid, nucleic acid, bile acid and vitamin metabolism. Glucose and lipid metabolism is a particular focus due to the significant promotion of , glucose aerobic oxidation, the pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid synthesis or oxidation, phospholipid and cholesterol biosynthesis affected by HBV. These altered metabolic pathways are involved in the pathological process of not only hepatitis , but also metabolic disorders, increasing the occurrence of complications, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and liver steatosis.

Here we used the Yorkshire pig as a control to analyze the Tibetan pig-specific liver miRNAome, and for preliminary investigation of differentially expressed miRNAs participating in metabolism. A comprehensive analysis of Tibetan and Yorkshire pig liver miRNAomes by small RNA sequencing identified 362 unique miRNAs. Among these, 304 were co-expressed in both libraries, and 10 and 48 miRNAs were specifically expressed. Differential expression analysis of miRNAs, miRNA target prediction and KEGG analysis revealed that differentially expressed miRNAs were associated mainly with the metabolism of glucose, lipid and protein. Six differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-34a, miR-326, miR-1, miR-335, miR-185 and miR-378) participating in the metabolism of glucose and lipid were identified. Additionally, qPCR results revealed that a lower expression of miR-34a in Tibetan pig liver may promote  by increasing the expression of Sirtuin type 1 (Sirt1); a lower expression of miR-1 in Tibetan pig liver may promote the synthesis and accumulation of lipid by increasing the expression of Liver X receptor α (LXRα); and a lower expression of miR-185 in Tibetan pig liver may promote the uptake of cholesterol from blood and secretion of bile by increasing the expression of the scavenger receptor class  type I (SR-BI). Our results provide new information and understanding of porcine miRNA profiles, which may help explain the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in the metabolic functions of Tibetan pig liver, and provide new biomarkers to assist in the development of Tibetan pig breeding characteristics.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier .V.

We sought the molecular basis for this sensitivity by utilizing a panel of mice possessing specific deletions of GHR signaling pathways. Metabolic clamps and glucose homeostasis tests were undertaken in these obese adult C57BL/6 male mice, which indicated impaired hepatic . Insulin sensitivity and glucose disappearance rate were enhanced in muscle and adipose of mice lacking the ability to activate the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)5  the GHR (-391) as for GHR-null () mice. These changes were associated with a striking inhibition of hepatic glucose output associated with altered glycogen metabolism and elevated hepatic glycogen content during unfed state. The enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity was associated with increased insulin receptor β and insulin receptor substrate 1 activation along with activated downstream protein kinase  signaling cascades. Although phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ()- expression was unchanged, its inhibitory acetylation was elevated because of decreased sirtuin-2 expression, thereby promoting loss of PCK1. Loss of STAT5 signaling to defined chromatin immunoprecipitation targets would further increase lipogenesis, supporting hepatosteatosis while lowering glucose output.

However, its role in insulin resistance (IR) remains unclear. Our objective is to explore the role of Gomafu in hepatic IR and glucose intolerance. Gomafu expression was determined in livers of ob/ob mice and high-fat diet (HFD) mice. The binding activity of NF-κ on the Gomafu promoter was measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative real-time PCR assays. Increased Gomafu expression was observed in the livers of obese mice. Besides, the binding of NF-κ on the Gomafu promoter was also observed in hepatocytes from ob/ob mice. Further study showed that knockdown of NF-κ p65 alleviated the increase in hepatic Gomafu expression in vivo and in vitro. Knockdown of hepatic Gomafu inhibited hepatic glucose production (HGP) and improved insulin sensitivity in obese mice, whereas, overexpression of hepatic Gomafu resulted in an increase in random and fasting blood glucose levels in lean mice. In addition, we demonstrated that Gomafu functioned as miR-139 sponge and led to the de-repression of its target gene Foxo1, which played an important role in  and HGP in hepatocytes. Finally, silenced Foxo1 expression abolished the effect of Gomafu overexpression on  and glucose production in hepatocytes.

However, it is presently unknown whether BACE1 and the product of its activity, soluble APPβ (sAPPβ), contribute to lipid-induced inflammation and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle cells.Studies were conducted in mouse C2C12 myotubes, skeletal muscle from Bace1mice and mice treated with sAPPβ and adipose tissue and plasma from obese and type 2 diabetic patients.We show that BACE1 inhibition or knockdown attenuates palmitate-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, inflammation, and insulin resistance and prevents the reduction in Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor γ Co-activator 1α (PGC-1α) and fatty acid oxidation caused by palmitate in myotubes. The effects of palmitate on ER stress, inflammation, insulin resistance, PGC-1α down-regulation, and fatty acid oxidation were mimicked by soluble APPβ in vitro. BACE1 expression was increased in subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese and type 2 diabetic patients and this was accompanied by a decrease in PGC-1α mRNA levels and by an increase in sAPPβ plasma levels of obese type 2 diabetic patients compared to obese non-diabetic subjects. Acute sAPPβ administration to mice reduced PGC-1α levels and increased inflammation in skeletal muscle and decreased insulin sensitivity.Collectively, these findings indicate that the BACE1 product sAPPβ is a key determinant in ER stress, inflammation and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and  in liver.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Koenig: A review on its phytochemistry, pharmacological and nutritional properties.</a></h2><p>Ackee plant (Blighia sapida K. D. Koenig) (Sapindaceae) is used in Sub-Saharan Africa (where it has its origin) and in different parts of the world (The Caribbean, North and South America, Europe). Traditionally it is used to manage numerous ailments like backache, constipation, cancer, fever in young children, gonorrhea, dysentery, psychosis, hernia, stomach ache, malaria, rheumatism, typhoid etc. It is also used as a cosmetic and food source. The fruit aril is the main constituent of the Jamaican National Dish. This review summarizes its phytochemistry, nutritional properties, ethnobotany and pharmacology. The need to gather up to date information on this plant, to facilitate in vivo and in vitro investigations for verification of some of the local claims necessitated this review.A literature search was performed on Ackee using ethno botanical text books and scientific databases such as PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO, Science-direct, Google, Google Scholar and other web sources like records from PROTA, PROSEA, JSTOR and Botanical Dermatology Database.This review highlights the traditional uses of parts of the Ackee plant: the bark, the leaves, capsules, roots and seeds. They are used in the management of diverse disease conditions such as diarrhoea, conjunctivitis, fever, internal hemorrhage, dysentery, cutaneous skin infections, and bacterial infections amongst others. Only nineteen compounds have been reportedly isolated from the parts of . sapida; Alkaloids, quinines, polyphenols, and steroids, their glycosides, sesquiterpenes and triterpenes. Some of the plant extracts and its isolated compounds showed anticancer, antimicrobial, antidiarrheal, antioxidant and hypoglycemic activities both in vitro and in vivo. The seed/leaves have also been used as insect repellants and the leaves have been reported to have lethal effects on larvae of various mosquitoes' species. The oil contains a lot of nutrients and may be considered for edible consumption after safety has been confirmed. Hypoglycin A and the less malignant hypoglycin  are found in the unripe aril of Ackee and consumption results in hypoglycemia, vomiting,  disruption which can result in coma and death. The untapped economic potential of its fruits is glaring in West Africa countries.Though .sapida has been put to enormous traditional use, the pharmacological studies conducted are not sufficient, most studies are either in-vivo or in-vitro. More work is required (well-designed pharmacological tests, randomized clinical trials) to evaluate these medicinal claims. This review provides a basis for future research. The isolation of more compounds,detailed pharmacological investigations, exploration of food use and detoxification techniques are key areas to investigate.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Resveratrol can play a beneficial role in the prevention and in the progression of chronic diseases related to inflammation such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegeneration, and cancers among other conditions. Moreover, resveratrol regulates immunity by interfering with immune cell regulation, proinflammatory cytokines' synthesis, and gene expression. At the molecular level, it targets sirtuin, adenosine monophosphate kinase, nuclear factor-κ, inflammatory cytokines, anti-oxidant enzymes along with cellular processes such as , lipid metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Resveratrol can suppress the toll-like receptor (TLR) and pro-inflammatory genes' expression. The antioxidant activity of resveratrol and the ability to inhibit enzymes involved in the production of eicosanoids contribute to its anti-inflammation properties. The effects of this biologically active compound on the immune system are associated with widespread health benefits for different autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases. This review offers a systematic understanding of how resveratrol targets multiple inflammatory components and exerts immune-regulatory effects on immune cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30716658>Adiponectin deficiency has no effect in murine autoimmune myocarditis.</a></h2><p>Adiponectin is a hormone that together with its receptors modulates a number of metabolic processes including  and lipid catabolism. It belongs to the C1QTNF (complement C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein) family, which has a variety of members with high amino acid sequence homology and overlapping functions. Concentration of adiponectin in blood is inversely correlated with body fat percentage and cardiac risk factors like blood pressure and CRP (C-reactive protein) level. Studies have identified the existence of a cardiac adiponectin system. However, little is known about the role of this system in the pathogenesis of autoimmune myocarditis. Thus, we have studied the involvement of adiponectin in the development of this autoimmune disorder in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM).Adiponectin knockout (ko) and wild type (wt) mice were immunized with cardiac troponin I (cTnI) to induce an EAM. To determine the severity of myocardial damage, inflammation and fibrosis were scored after HE and Afog staining and high sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) level was measured. To detect if changes in specific inflammatory cell numbers could be observed between the genotypes, we performed immunohistochemical staining to detect T lymphocytes,  lymphocytes and macrophages. The level of the humoral immune response was determined through the measurement of cTnI-specific serum IgG autoantibodies. Relative mRNA expression of different cytokines, C1QTNF family members and adiponectin receptors in the heart tissue was analyzed with qPCR.Animals immunized with cTnI developed autoimmune myocarditis with a significant deterioration of cardiac parameters compared to the corresponding control group. The adiponectin ko group immunized with cTnI showed a tendency towards increased inflammation, fibrosis, heart-to-body-weight ratio, infiltration pattern of T lymphocytes,  lymphocytes and macrophages, hsTnT concentration, humoral immune response and mRNA expression of interleukin 6 in the heart tissue and decreased weight gain compared to the wt group immunized with cTnI. However, the difference to the wt group treated with cTnI was not significant. The analysis of cardiac mRNA expression of adiponectin receptors and four C1QTNF family members, most suitable for fulfilling the functions of adiponectin in adiponectin ko mice, did not show any significant differences between adiponectin ko and wt group at all.Our study reveals that the absence of adiponectin did not lead to a significantly increased impairment of cardiac function and was also unlikely to be compensated by its receptors or other C1QTNF family members in the murine model of EAM. Here, other synergistic or redundant effects might play a role and must be investigated in further studies to understand the role and function of adiponectin in autoimmune myocarditis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of the current study was to determine the molecular effects of intermittent hypoxia (IH) on hepatic insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis, and whether c-Jun NH2-terminal-kinase (JNK) contributed to metabolic responses to IH in liver cells.The human HepG2 cells and rat FAO cells were exposed to 10, 30, 120, 240 or 360 cycles of IH (1% O2 for 60 s followed by 21% O2 for 60s, 7.5 cycles per hour) or normoxia as a control. In a subgroup, we exposed cells to 360 cycles of IH with the JNK inhibitor SP600125. After IH exposure, cell glycogen content and glucose output were measured using colorimetric assay kits. Canonical insulin signaling and gluconeogenic genes were measured by western blot and quantitative polymerase chain reaction.IH decreased insulin-stimulated protein kinase  (AKT)/glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner, while inhibiting forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) expression and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) transcription independent of insulin signaling. JNK inhibitor SP600125 partially restored AKT/ GSK-3β phosphorylation and glycogen synthesis, but did not affect other IH-induced glucose metabolic changes.IH in vitro impaired insulin signal transduction in liver cells as assessed by inhibited AKT/GSK-3β phosphorylation via JNK activation. IH inhibited FOXO1 and  in an insulin-independent manner.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

The organismal impact of systemic inhibition of Vps34 kinase activity is not completely understood. Here we show that heterozygous Vps34 kinase-dead mice are healthy and display a robustly enhanced insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, phenotypes mimicked by a selective Vps34 inhibitor in wild-type mice. The underlying mechanism of insulin sensitization is multifactorial and not through the canonical insulin/Akt pathway. Vps34 inhibition alters cellular energy metabolism, activating the AMPK pathway in liver and muscle. In liver, Vps34 inactivation mildly dampens autophagy, limiting substrate availability for mitochondrial respiration and reducing . In muscle, Vps34 inactivation triggers a metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation towards glycolysis and enhanced glucose uptake. Our study identifies Vps34 as a new drug target for insulin resistance in Type-2 diabetes, in which the unmet therapeutic need remains substantial.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30481177>A metabolome-wide characterization of the diabetic phenotype in ZDF rats and its reversal by pioglitazone.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disease associated with alterations in glucose, lipid and protein metabolism. In order to characterize the biochemical phenotype of the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat, the most common animal model for the study of T2D, and the impact of the insulin sensitizer pioglitazone, a global, mass spectrometry-based analysis of the metabolome was conducted. Overall, 420 metabolites in serum, 443 in the liver and 603 in the intestine were identified at study end. In comparison to two control groups, obese diabetic ZDF rats showed characteristic metabolic signatures that included hyperglycemia, elevated β-oxidation, dyslipidemia-featured by an increase in saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and a decrease of medium chain and of polyunsaturated fatty acids in serum-and decreased amino acid levels, consistent with their utilization in hepatic . A 13-week treatment with the PPARγ agonist pioglitazone reversed most of these signatures: Pioglitazone improved glycemic control and the fatty acid profile, elevated amino acid levels in the liver, but decreased branched chain amino acids in serum. The hitherto most comprehensive metabolic profiling study identified a biochemical blueprint for the ZDF diabetic model and captured the impact of genetic, nutritional and pharmacological perturbations. The in-depth characterization on the molecular level deepens the understanding and further validates the ZDF rat as a suitable preclinical model of diabetes in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27130437>Investigation of salicylate hepatic responses in comparison with chemical analogues of the drug.</a></h2><p>Anti-hyperglycaemic effects of the hydroxybenzoic acid salicylate might stem from effects of the drug on mitochondrial uncoupling, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, and inhibition of NF-κ signalling. Here, we have gauged the contribution of these effects to control of hepatocyte glucose production, comparing salicylate with inactive hydroxybenzoic acid analogues of the drug. In rat H4IIE hepatoma cells, salicylate was the only drug tested that activated AMPK. Salicylate also reduced mTOR signalling, but this property was observed widely among the analogues. In a sub-panel of analogues, salicylate alone reduced promoter activity of the key gluconeogenic enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase and suppressed basal glucose production in mouse primary hepatocytes. Both salicylate and 2,6 dihydroxybenzoic acid suppressed TNFα-induced Iκ degradation, and in genetic knockout experiments, we found that the effect of salicylate on Iκ degradation was AMPK-independent. Previous data also identified AMPK-independent regulation of glucose but we found that direct inhibition of neither NF-κ nor mTOR signalling suppressed glucose production, suggesting that other factors besides these cell signalling pathways may need to be considered to account for this response to salicylate. We found, for example, that H4IIE cells were exquisitely sensitive to uncoupling with modest doses of salicylate, which occurred on a similar time course to another anti-hyperglycaemic uncoupling agent 2,4-dinitrophenol, while there was no discernible effect at all of two salicylate analogues which are not anti-hyperglycaemic. This finding supports much earlier literature suggesting that salicylates exert anti-hyperglycaemic effects at least in part through uncoupling.Copyright © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier .V.

Objective This study investigated the hepatic mechanisms of action of C. lanceolatum flowers ethanol extract (ClEtOH) related to its antihyperglycaemic effect in streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Materials and methods Male Wistar rats were divided into normal (N) and diabetic control (DC) rats treated with vehicle (water); diabetic rats treated with 500 mg/kg metformin (DMet) or 500 mg/kg ClEtOH (DT500). After 21 d of treatment, hepatic glucose and urea production were investigated through in situ perfused liver with l-glutamine. Changes in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) levels and in the activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and insulin-signalling intermediates were also investigated. Results Similar to DMet, DT500 rats showed a reduction in the rates of hepatic production of glucose (46%) and urea (22%) in comparison with DC. This reduction was accompanied by a reduction in the PEPCK levels in liver of DT500 (28%) and DMet (43%) when compared with DC. AMPK phosphorylation levels were higher in the liver of DT500 (17%) and DMet (16%) rats. The basal AKT phosphorylation levels were increased in liver of DT500 rats, without differences in the insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation and in the insulin receptor levels between DC and DT500 rats. Discussion and conclusion The antidiabetic activity of ClEtOH can be attributed, at least in part, to inhibition of hepatic , probably due to the activation of both AMPK and AKT effectors and reduction in the PEPCK levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28678523>Nutritional biomarkers: Current view and future perspectives.</a></h2><p>There is a poor relationship between nutrient intake and existing nutritional biomarkers due to variety of factors affecting their sensitivity and specificity. To explore the impact of nutrients at molecular level and devising a sensitive biomarker, proteomics is a central technology with sirtuins as one of the most promising nutritional biomarker. Sirtuins (seven mammalian sirtuins reported so far) have been reported to perform protein deacetylases and ADP-ribosyltransferases activity. It is distributed in different cellular compartments thereby controlling several metabolic processes. Sirtuins are oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dependent, which implicates a direct effect of the metabolic state of the cell on its activity. Calorie restriction upregulates the mammalian sirtuin protein levels in variety of tissues and organs where it acts upon both histone and nonhistone substrates. Sirtuin senses nutrient availability and impacts , glycolysis, and insulin sensitivity. It deacetylates and inhibits the nuclear receptor that activates fat synthesis and adipogenesis in the body, leading to fat loss and bringing favorable cellular and health changes. Sirtuins mediates intracellular response that promotes cell survival, DNA damage repair thereby increasing the cell longitivity. The activation of sirtuins brings a wide spectrum of other health benefits and its activity levels are indicative of nutritional status as well as disease progression in cancer, inflammation, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and viral infections. There are several foods that activate sirtuin activity and offer significant health benefits by their consumption.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26706021>Beneficial action of resveratrol: How and why?</a></h2><p>Flavonoid resveratrol modulates the transcription factor NF-κ; inhibits the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1 A1; suppresses the expression and activity of cyclooxygenase enzymes; and modulates Fas/Fas-ligand-mediated apoptosis, p53, mammalian target of rapamycin, and cyclins and various phosphodiesterases. This increases the cytosolic cAMP that activates Epac1/CaMKKβ/AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α pathway, which in turn facilitates increased oxidation of fatty acids, mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial respiration, and . Resveratrol triggers apoptosis of activated T cells and suppresses tumor necrosis factor-α, interluekin-17 (IL-17), and other proinflammatory molecules, and thus is of benefit in autoimmune diseases. In addition, resveratrol inhibits expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor, explaining its effective action against cancer. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) that is involved in the pathogenesis of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome is also altered in depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism. We noted that BDNF protects against cytotoxic actions of alloxan, streptozotocin, and benzo(a)pyrene. Resveratrol prevents bisphenol A-induced autism, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome, suggesting that it may augment BDNF synthesis and action. We also observed that BDNF levels are low in type 2 diabetes mellitus and that BDNF enhances production of antiinflammatory lipid, lipoxin A4, whose levels are low in diabetes mellitus. Thus, resveratrol may augment production of lipoxin A4. Resveratrol alters gut microbiota and influences stem cell proliferation and differentiation. These pleiotropic actions of resveratrol may explain the multitude of its actions and benefits.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, the physiological roles of zebrafish insulin receptor a and  in maintaining blood glucose homeostasis were characterized. We observed that, though blood glucose in insra-/- fish and insrb-/- fish were comparable with the control siblings at 0 h postprandium (hpp), the most evident hyperglycemia have been observed in insra-/- fish from 1 hpp to 3 hpp. A mild increase of blood glucose in insrb-/- fish has been seen only at 1.5 hpp. The down-regulated expressions of glycolytic enzymes were observed in insra-/- fish and insrb-/- fish liver and muscle, together with the significantly decreased activities or concentrations of glycolytic enzymes. These results suggest that both Insra and Insrb were critical in glycolysis. Intriguingly, the up-regulated expressions of gluconeogenic enzymes, pck1 and g6pca.1, along with the elevated enzyme activities, were observed in insra-/- fish liver at 1 hpp and 1.5 hpp. Compared with the control fish, the elevated plasma insulin and lowered phosphorylated AKT were observed in insra-/- fish and insrb-/- fish, suggesting that there is an insulin resistance in insra-/- fish and insrb-/- fish. The increased levels of both transcriptions of foxo1a and Foxo1a protein abundance in the insra-/- fish liver have been found. When insra-/- fish treated with the Foxo1 inhibitor, the postprandial blood glucose levels could be normalized, accompanied with the normalized expression levels and enzyme activities of both pck1 and g6pca.1. Therefore, Insra and Insrb demonstrate a similar role in promoting glycolysis, but Insra is involved in inhibiting  via down-regulating the expression of foxo1a. Our results indicate that Insra and Insrb exhibit diversified functions in maintaining glucose homeostasis in zebrafish.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

To understand the effect of pH on the structure, function, and stability of CAVA, we employed spectroscopic techniques such as circular dichroism, fluorescence, and absorbance measurements in wide range of pH (from pH 2.0 to pH 11.5). CAVA showed an aggregation at acidic pH range from pH 2.0 to pH 5.0. However, it remains stable and maintains its secondary structure in the pH range, pH 7.0-pH 11.5.

Only Gyk isoform  is present in whole cells, but its function in the nucleus remains elusive. Previous studies have shown that nuclear orphan receptor subfamily 4 group A member (NR4A)-1 is an important regulator of hepatic glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism in adipose tissue. We aimed to elucidate the functional interaction between nuclear Gyk and NR4A1 during hepatic  in the unfed state and diabetes. We identified nuclear Gyk as a novel corepressor of NR4A1 in the liver; moreover, this recruitment was dependent on the C-terminal ligand-binding domain instead of the N-terminal activation function 1 domain, which interacts with other NR4A1 coregulators. NR4A1 transcriptional activity was inhibited by Gyk  protein-protein interaction but not enzymatic activity. Moreover, Gyk overexpression suppressed NR4A1 ability to regulate the expression of target genes involved in hepatic   and  as well as blood glucose regulation, which was observed in both unfed and diabetic mice.

Of these, 11 rats were randomly selected as healthy controls and diabetes was induced in the remaining 36 rats by administering a high-fat and high-sugar diet for 6 weeks, followed by two intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin. The 36 rats were screened for diabetes and then randomly divided into three groups: Model, metformin and DMix groups. Following 12 weeks of treatment, the fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycosylated serum protein (GSP), serum insulin, blood lipids [total cholesterol (Tch) and triglycerides (TG)], alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) were assessed. In addition, hematoxylin and eosin staining was used for histomorphological examination of the liver tissues. The mRNA expression of insulin receptor (InsR), forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase) in the liver was measured with reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the protein expression of InsR, phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated (p)-PI3K, protein kinase  (Akt), p-Akt, FoxO1, PEPCK and G6Pase in the liver was measured by western blot analysis. The FBG, GSP, InsR, Tch, TG, ALT and AST levels were significantly lower in the DMix-treated group compared with the model group (P<0.05). In addition, DMix treatment notably improved liver histopathology and significantly increased the gene and protein expression of InsR, PI3K and Akt (P<0.05). DMix treatment also significantly reduced the gene and protein expression of FoxO1, PEPCK and G6Pase (P<0.05). DMix effectively reduced FBG and blood lipids and significantly improved liver function and insulin resistance in diabetic rats, possibly by regulating the gene and protein expression of molecules associated with the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26916239>Effects of roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery on postprandial fructose metabolism.</a></h2><p>Fructose is partly metabolized in small bowel enterocytes, where it can be converted into glucose or fatty acids.

The biodiesel-derived glycerol can be used as an attractive feedstock for γ-PGA production due to its availability and low price; however, insufficient production of γ-PGA from glycerol is limitation.The metabolic pathway of  WX-02 was rewired to improve the efficiency of glycerol assimilation and the supply of NADPH for γ-PGA synthesis. GlpK, GlpX, Zwf, and Tkt1 were found to be the key enzymes for γ-PGA synthesis using glycerol as a feedstock. Through combinational expression of these key enzymes, the γ-PGA titer increased to 19.20 ± 1.57 g/L, which was 1.50-fold of that of the wild-type strain. Then, we studied the flux distributions, gene expression, and intracellular metabolites in WX-02 and the recombinant strain BC4 (over-expression of the above quadruple enzymes). Our results indicated that over-expression of the quadruple enzymes redistributed metabolic flux to γ-PGA synthesis. Furthermore, using crude glycerol as carbon source, the BC4 strain showed a high productivity of 0.38 g/L/h, and produced 18.41 g/L γ-PGA, with a high yield of 0.46 g γ-PGA/g glycerol.The approach to rewiring of metabolic pathways enables  to efficiently synthesize γ-PGA from glycerol. The γ-PGA productivity reported in this work is the highest obtained in glutamate-free medium. The present study demonstrates that the recombinant  strain shows significant potential to produce valuable compounds from crude glycerol.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29733999>Discovery and structure-activity relationships study of thieno[2,3-]pyridine analogues as hepatic  inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic, complex and multifactorial metabolic disorder, and targeting  inhibition is a promising strategy for anti-diabetic drug discovery. This study discovered a new class of thieno[2,3-]pyridine derivatives as hepatic  inhibitors. First, a hit compound (DMT: IC = 33.8 μM) characterized by a thienopyridine core was identified in a cell-based screening of our privileged small molecule library. Structure activity relationships (SARs) study showed that replaced the CF in the thienopyridine core could improve the potency and led to the discovery of 8e (IC = 16.8 μM) and 9d (IC = 12.3 μM) with potent inhibition of hepatic glucose production and good drug-like properties. Furthermore, the mechanism of 8e for the inhibition of hepatic glucose production was also identified, which could be effective through the reductive expression of the mRNA transcription level of gluconeogenic genes, including glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Additionally, 8e could also reduce the fasting blood glucose and improve the oral glucose tolerance and pyruvate tolerance in db/db mice. The optimization of this class of derivatives had provided us a start point to develop new anti-hepatic  agents.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, little is known about their ecological role and functions in biogeochemical cycles. Penicillium decumbens, S. strictum, and F. fujikuroi were isolated from the coastal upwelling zone off south-central Chile. Their carbon profiles were characterized using Biolog FF MicroPlates. These species used a wide range of carbon sources, mainly carbohydrates, but also amino acids, suggesting the use of metabolic routes that include glycolysis/. Substrate richness revealed a great capacity for the utilization of nutritional sources, reflected by the following Shannon Indices of utilization of specific substrates: 4.02 for S. strictum, 4.01 for P. decumbes, and 3.91 for F. fujikuroi, which reveals a high physiological capacity for oxidizing different substrates. Significant differences were found between 18 substrates utilized by all three species. Results suggest that filamentous fungi should be considered an integral part of the marine microbial community and included in biogeochemical cycling models of upwelling ecosystems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28461341>PGLP-1, a novel long-acting dual-function GLP-1 analog, ameliorates streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia and inhibits body weight loss.</a></h2><p>It is well known that glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) has antidiabetic action. It has 2 distinct functions, an insulinotropic effect dependent on GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and an insulinomimetic effect independent of GLP-1R. However, use of GLP-1  is limited by its short half-life. Therefore, our lab designed PGLP-1, a novel 2-function candidate peptide as a potential substitute. Using a streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemic mouse model, we demonstrated  and  that PGLP-1 had insulinotropic actions dependent on GLP-1R and insulinomimetic functions independent of GLP-1R. PGLP-1 treatment increased islet β-cell mass, plasma insulin, and C-peptide levels and Ki-67-immunoreactive β-cell numbers, verifying that PGLP-1 can work as a short GLP-1R agonist, similar to commercially available exendin-4. Additionally, PGLP-1 improved insulin sensitivity, inhibited  by increasing expression of AMPK and receptor subfamily 0, group , member 2 (SHP), and inhibited body weight loss by inhibiting β-oxidation, suggesting that PGLP-1 had insulinomimetic action. Taken together, these data indicated that PGLP-1, as a dual-function peptide, improved glycemic control and inhibited body weight loss, suggesting it could be useful for type 1 diabetes mellitus patients as an adjunctive therapy to insulin.-Gao, H., Zhao, Q., Song, Z., Yang, Z., Wu, Y., Tang, S., Alahdal, M., Zhang, Y., Jin, L.

An abnormality of the main intestinal fructose transporter proteins has been proposed as a cause for fructose malabsorption. However the underlying molecular mechanism for this remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) plays a role in intestinal fructose absorption through the regulation of genes involved in fructose transport and metabolism and ion transport.Wild type (WT) and Chrebp knockout (KO) mice (6 or 8 weeks old) were fed a control diet (55% starch, 15% maltodextrin 10) or high-fructose diet (HFrD, 60% fructose, 10% starch) for 3-12 days. Body weight and food intake were measured, signs of fructose malabsorption were monitored, and the expression of genes involved in fructose transport/metabolism and ion transport was evaluated. Furthermore, transient transfection and chromatin immunoprecipitation were performed to show the direct interaction between ChREBP and carbohydrate response elements in the promoter of Slc2A5, which encodes the fructose transporter GLUT5.Chrebp KO mice fed the control diet maintained a constant body weight, whereas those fed a HFrD showed significant weight loss within 3-5 days. In addition, Chrebp KO mice fed the HFrD exhibited a markedly distended cecum and proximal colon containing both fluid and gas, suggesting incomplete fructose absorption. Fructose-induced increases of genes involved in fructose transport (GLUT5), fructose metabolism (fructokinase, aldolase , triokinase, and lactate dehydrogenase), and  (glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase) were observed in the intestine of WT but not of Chrebp KO mice. Moreover the Na/H exchanger NHE3, which is involved in Na and water absorption in the intestine, was significantly decreased in HFrD-fed Chrebp KO mice. Consistent with this finding, the high-fructose diet-fed Chrebp KO mice developed severe diarrhea. Results of chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed a direct interaction of ChREBP with the Glut5 promoter, but not the Nhe3 promoter, in the small intestine. Ectopic co-expression of ChREBP and its heterodimer partner Max-like protein X activated the Glut5 promoter in Caco-2BBE cells.ChREBP plays a key role in the dietary fructose transport as well as conversion into lactate and glucose through direct transcriptional control of genes involved in fructose transport, fructolysis, and . Moreover, ablation of Chrebp results in a severe diarrhea in mice fed a high-fructose diet, which is associated with the insufficient induction of GLUT5 in the intestine.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Discovered in the late 1940s but abandoned in the 1970s, polymyxins (i.e., polymyxin  and colistin) have been revived as the last-line therapy against Gram-negative "superbugs," including MDR A. baumannii. Worryingly, resistance to polymyxins in A. baumannii has been increasingly reported, urging the development of novel antimicrobial therapies to rescue this last-line class of antibiotics. In the present study, we integrated genome-scale metabolic modeling with multiomics data to elucidate the mechanisms of cellular responses to colistin treatment in A. baumannii. A genome-scale metabolic model, ATCC19606, was constructed for strain ATCC 19606 based on the literature and genome annotation, containing 897 genes, 1,270 reactions, and 1,180 metabolites. After extensive curation, prediction of growth on 190 carbon sources using ATCC19606 achieved an overall accuracy of 84.3% compared to Biolog experimental results. Prediction of gene essentiality reached a high accuracy of 86.1% and 82.7% compared to two transposon mutant libraries of AB5075 and ATCC 17978, respectively. Further integrative modeling with our correlative transcriptomics and metabolomics data deciphered the complex regulation on metabolic responses to colistin treatment, including (i) upregulated fluxes through gluconeogenesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis; (ii) downregulated TCA cycle and peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide biogenesis; and (iii) altered fluxes over respiratory chain. Our results elucidated the interplay of multiple metabolic pathways under colistin treatment in A. baumannii and provide key mechanistic insights into optimizing polymyxin combination therapy.  Combating antimicrobial resistance has been highlighted as a critical global health priority. Due to the drying drug discovery pipeline, polymyxins have been employed as the last-line therapy against Gram-negative "superbugs"; however, the detailed mechanisms of antibacterial killing remain largely unclear, hampering the improvement of polymyxin therapy. Our integrative modeling using the constructed genome-scale metabolic model ATCC19606 and the correlative multiomics data provide the fundamental understanding of the complex metabolic responses to polymyxin treatment in A. baumannii at the systems level. The model ATCC19606 may have a significant potential in antimicrobial systems pharmacology research in A. baumannii.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070245>Comparative proteomic analysis of plasma of children with congenital heart disease.</a></h2><p>Congenital heart disease is one of the largest class of birth defects. Eight subjects with ventricular septal defect (VSD, a kind of congenital heart disease) and 11 health children were enrolled in tandem mass tags label-based quantitative proteomic analysis to compare plasma proteins differentially abundance. A total of 66 proteins were significantly upregulated or downregulated in VSD patients compared with healthy children. These proteins were involved in pathways linked to platelet activation, fructose and mannose metabolism, complement and coagulation cascades, glycolysis/, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and carbon metabolism. The amount of ten proteins changed significantly (p < 0.05) in newly recruited 30 VSD compared with 15 control children, which were validated by ELISA. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of fructose-bisphosphate aldolase  (ALDOB) and thymosin beta-4 (Tβ4) were higher than those of other candidate proteins. ALDOB and Tβ4 might be potential biomarkers applied for identifying VSD in the further works.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Male Wistar rats were fed with or without OA supplementation for 30, 60, and 90 days. The NAFLD group showed increased liver lipid at 30, 60, and 90 days; glucose intolerance was noted at 60 and 90 days. Furthermore, partial liver proteins and gene expressions related to upstream signaling of insulin were decreased. However, the liver glycogen content was elevated, and  genes expressions were obviously decreased at 90 days. The occurrence of fatty liver preceded insulin resistance in OA-induced NAFLD without the interference of obesity and hyperlipidemia, and hepatic insulin resistance may not play a conclusive role in insulin resistance in this model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29304290>Effects of metformin on insulin resistance and metabolic disorders in tumor-bearing rats with advanced cachexia.</a></h2><p>Metformin (MET) is widely used in the correction of insulin (INS) resistance and metabolic abnormalities in type 2 diabetes. However, its effect on INS resistance and metabolic disorders associated with cancer cachexia is not established. We investigated the MET effects, isolated or associated with INS, on INS resistance and metabolic changes induced by Walker-256 tumor in rats with advanced cachexia. MET (500 mg·kg, oral) and MET + INS (1.0 IU·kg, s.c.) were administered for 12 days, starting on the day of tumor cell inoculation. Tumor-bearing rats showed adipose and muscle mass wasting, body mass loss, anorexia, decreased Akt phosphorylation in retroperitoneal and mesenteric adipose tissue, peripheral INS resistance, hypoinsulinemia, reduced INS content and secretion from pancreatic islets, and also inhibition of glycolysis, , and glycogenolysis in liver. MET and MET + INS treatments did not prevent these changes. It can be concluded that treatments with MET and MET + INS did not prevent the adipose and muscle mass wasting and body mass loss of tumor-bearing rats possibly by not improving INS resistance. Therefore, MET, used for the treatment of INS resistance in type 2 diabetes, is not effective in improving INS resistance in the advanced stage of cancer cachexia, evidencing that the drug does not have the same beneficial effect in these 2 diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29193752>The Proteomic Response of Bacillus pumilus Cells to Glucose Starvation.</a></h2><p>Since starvation for carbon sources is a common condition for bacteria in nature and it can also occur in industrial fermentation processes due to mixing zones, knowledge about the response of cells to carbon starvation is beneficial. The preferred carbon source for bacilli is glucose. The response of Bacillus pumilus cells to glucose starvation using metabolic labeling and quantitative proteomics was analyzed. Glucose starvation led to an extensive reprogramming of the protein expression pattern in . pumilus. The amounts of proteins of the central carbon metabolic pathways (glycolysis and TCC) remained stable in starving cells. Proteins for  were found in higher amounts during starvation. Furthermore, many proteins involved in acquisition and usage of alternative carbon sources were present in elevated amounts in starving cells. Enzymes for fatty acid degradation and proteases and peptidases were also found in higher abundance when cells entered stationary phase. Among the proteins found in lower amounts were many enzymes involved in amino acid and nucleotide synthesis and several NRPS and PKS proteins.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Another hypothesis for why we get fat has surfaced in the last decade which is the idea that the overconsumption of added sugars and refined carbohydrates induce insulin resistance and high insulin levels causing obesity. While insulin is a fat-storing hormone, this hypothesis does not explain visceral adiposity, or why certain people are found to have fat stored in and around their organs. We propose a new mechanism for body fattening, particular visceral adiposity. This hypothesis involves the overconsumption of fructose, which leads to inflammation in all cells that metabolize it rapidly. When fructose is metabolized in subcutaneous adipocytes, the subsequent inflammation leads to an increase in intracellular cortisol in order to help squelch the inflammation. Unfortunately, the increase in intracellular cortisol leads to an increased flux of fatty acids out of the subcutaneous adipocytes allowing more substrate for fat storage into visceral fat tissue. Moreover fructose-induced inflammation in the liver also leads to increased intracellular cortisol via an upregulation of 11- hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 causing increased fat storage in the liver (i.e., fatty liver). In essence, the fructose-induced inflammatory cortisol response causes "thin on the outside, fat on the inside" (TOFI). Furthermore, fructose in the brain, either from fructose uptake via the blood brain barrier or endogenous formation from glucose via the polyol pathway stimulates an increased release of cortisol causing hepatic  leading to overall insulin resistance and further body fattening. This review paper will discuss in detail the hypothesis that fructose-induced inflammation and cortisol activation causes visceral adiposity.Copyright © 2017 Anesthesia History Association.

However, we have recently shown that improved insulin action is associated with increased FMO expression in livers of protein kinase C-deficient mice. Here, we investigated whether FMO3 expression affected insulin signaling, glucose metabolism, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in hepatocytes. HepG2 and IHH hepatocytes were transfected with FMO3 cDNA for overexpression, or small interfering RNA for knockdown. Cells were treated with palmitate to induce insulin resistance and insulin signaling, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene expression and ER stress markers were examined by immunoblotting and RT-PCR. Glycogen synthesis was measured using [(14)C]glucose. Palmitate treatment reduced insulin signaling at the level of Akt phosphorylation and glycogen synthesis, which were little affected by FMO3 overexpression. However, the fatty acid also increased the levels of several ER stress markers and activation of caspase 3, which were counteracted by FMO3 overexpression and exacerbated by FMO3 knockdown. Although FMO3 expression did not reverse lipid effects on protein thiol redox in hepatocytes, it did prevent up-regulation of the gluconeogenic enzyme PEPCK by pharmacological ER stress inducers or by palmitate. ER stress and PEPCK levels were also reduced in livers of fat-fed protein kinase Cδ-deficient mice. Our data indicate that FMO3 can contribute to the regulation of glucose metabolism in the liver by reducing lipid-induced ER stress and the expression of PEPCK, independently of insulin signal transduction.</p></html>
