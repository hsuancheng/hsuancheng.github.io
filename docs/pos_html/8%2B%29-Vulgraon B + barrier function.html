(CuEC) exert a hypotensive effect via regulating vascular tone.</a></h2><p>As an effective medicine for jaundice in traditional Chinese medicine, Cucumis melo L. has been widely used in China. However, its effect on vascular  is still unclear. In this study, we extracted the compounds of Cucumis melo L., and the major ingredients were identified as cucurbitacins (CuEC, cucurbitacins extracted from Cucumis melo L.), especially cucurbitacin . We replicated the toxicity in mice by intraperitoneal injection of a high dose of CuEC (2 mg/kg) and demonstrated that the cause of death was CuEC-induced impairment of the endothelial  and, thus, increased vascular permeability via decreasing VE-cadherin conjunction. The administration of low doses of CuEC (1 mg/kg) led to a decline in systolic blood pressure (SBP) without causing toxicity in mice. More importantly, CuEC dramatically suppressed angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced SBP increase. Further studies demonstrated that CuEC facilitated acetylcholine-mediated vasodilation in mesenteric arteries of mice. In vitro studies showed that CuEC induced vasodilation in a dose-dependent manner in mesenteric arteries of both mice and rats. Pretreatment with CuEC inhibited phenylephrine-mediated vasoconstriction. In summary, a moderate dose of CuEC reduced SBP by improving blood vessel tension. Therefore, our study provides new experimental evidence for developing new antihypertensive drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31010378>Doxorubicin-induced neurotoxicity is associated with acute alterations in synaptic plasticity, apoptosis, and lipid peroxidation.</a></h2><p>Cognitive deficits are commonly reported by patients following treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. Anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimens are associated with cognitive impairment and reductions in neuronal connectivity in cancer survivors, and doxorubicin (Dox) is a commonly used anthracycline. Although it has been reported that Dox distribution to the central nervous system (CNS) is limited, considerable Dox concentrations are observed in the brain with co-administration of certain medications. Additionally, pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are overproduced in cancer or in response to chemotherapy, can reduce the integrity of the blood-brain  (BBB). Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the acute neurotoxic effects of Dox on hippocampal neurons. In this study, we utilized a hippocampal cell line (H19-7/IGF-IR) along with rodent hippocampal slices to evaluate the acute neurotoxic effects of Dox. Hippocampal slices were used to measure long-term potentiation (LTP), and expression of proteins was determined by immunoblotting. Cellular assays for mitochondrial complex activity and lipid peroxidation were also utilized. We observed reduction in LTP in hippocampal slices with Dox. In addition, lipid peroxidation was increased as measured by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances content indicating oxidative stress. Caspase-3 expression was increased indicating an increased propensity for cell death. Finally, the phosphorylation of signaling molecules which modulate LTP including extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Akt were increased. This data indicates that acute Dox exposure dose-dependently impairs synaptic processes associated with hippocampal neurotransmission, induces apoptosis, and increases lipid peroxidation leading to neurotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31119823>In situ molecular characterization of endoneurial microvessels that form the blood-nerve  in normal human adult peripheral nerves.</a></h2><p>The blood-nerve  (BNB) formed by tight junction-forming endoneurial microvessels located in the innermost compartment of peripheral nerves, and the perineurium serve to maintain the internal microenvironment required for normal signal transduction. The specific molecular components that define the normal adult human BNB are not fully known. Guided by data derived from the adult human BNB transcriptome, we evaluated the in situ expression of 25 junctional complex, transporter, cell membrane, and cytoskeletal proteins in four histologically normal adult sural nerves by indirect fluorescent immunohistochemistry to determine proteins specifically expressed by restrictive endoneurial microvascular endothelium. Using Ulex Europaeus Agglutinin-1 expression to detect endothelial cells, we ascertained that the selected proteins were uniformly expressed in ≥90% of endoneurial microvessels. P-glycoprotein (also known as adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily  member 1) and solute carrier family 1 member 1 demonstrated restricted expression by endoneurial endothelium only, with classic tight junction protein claudin-5 also expressed on fenestrated epineurial macrovessels, and vascular-specific adherens junction protein cadherin-5 also expressed by the perineurium. The expression profiles of the selected proteins provide significant insight into the molecular composition of normal adult peripheral nerves. Further work is required to elucidate the human adult BNB molecular signature in order to better understand its development and devise strategies to restore  in peripheral neuropathies.© 2019 Peripheral Nerve Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31434575>Streptococcus agalactiae disrupts P-glycoprotein  in brain endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>Bacterial meningitis is a serious life threatening infection of the CNS. To cause meningitis, blood-borne bacteria need to interact with and penetrate brain endothelial cells (BECs) that comprise the blood-brain . BECs help maintain brain homeostasis and they possess an array of efflux transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), that  to efflux potentially harmful compounds from the CNS back into the circulation. Oftentimes, efflux also serves to limit the brain uptake of therapeutic drugs, representing a major hurdle for CNS drug delivery. During meningitis, BEC  integrity is compromised; however, little is known about efflux transport perturbations during infection. Thus, understanding the impact of bacterial infection on P-gp  would be important for potential routes of therapeutic intervention. To this end, the meningeal bacterial pathogen, Streptococcus agalactiae, was found to inhibit P-gp activity in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived BECs, and live bacteria were required for the observed inhibition. This observation was correlated to decreased P-gp expression both in vitro and during infection in vivo using a mouse model of bacterial meningitis. Given the impact of bacterial interactions on P-gp , it will be important to incorporate these findings into analyses of drug delivery paradigms for bacterial infections of the CNS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31402170>Endothelin receptor-A mediates degradation of the glomerular endothelial surface layer via pathologic crosstalk between activated podocytes and glomerular endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>Emerging evidence of crosstalk between glomerular cells in pathological settings provides opportunities for novel therapeutic discovery. Here we investigated underlying mechanisms of early events leading to filtration  defects of podocyte and glomerular endothelial cell crosstalk in the mouse models of primary podocytopathy (podocyte specific transforming growth factor-β receptor 1 signaling activation) or Adriamycin nephropathy. We found that glomerular endothelial surface layer degradation and albuminuria preceded podocyte foot process effacement. These abnormalities were prevented by endothelin receptor-A antagonism and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species scavenging. Additional studies confirmed increased heparanase and hyaluronoglucosaminidase gene expression in glomerular endothelial cells in response to podocyte-released factors and to endothelin-1. Atomic force microscopy measurements showed a significant reduction in the endothelial surface layer by endothelin-1 and podocyte-released factors, which could be prevented by endothelin receptor-A but not endothelin receptor- antagonism. Thus, our studies provide evidence of early crosstalk between activated podocytes and glomerular endothelial cells resulting in loss of endothelial surface layer, glomerular endothelial cell injury and albuminuria. Hence, activation of endothelin-1-endothelin receptor-A and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species contribute to the pathogenesis of primary podocytopathies in experimental focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.Copyright © 2019 International Society of Nephrology.

This study sought to inhibit planktonic and biofilm MRSA using furanoquinone-derived compounds containing imine moiety. A total of 19 furanoquinone analogs were designed, synthesized, and assessed for anti-MRSA potency. Among 19 compounds, (Z)-4-(hydroxyimino)naphtho[1,2-]furan-5(4)-one (HNF) and (Z)-4-(acetoxyimino)naphtho[1,2-]furan-5(4)-one (ANF) showed antibacterial activity superior to the others based on an agar diffusion assay. HNF and ANF exerted a bactericidal effect with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 9.7 ∼ 19.5 and 2.4 ∼ 9.7 μg/ml, respectively. Both compounds were able to reduce the MRSA count by 1,000-fold in biofilm as compared to the control.  efficacy was evaluated using a mouse model of skin infection. Topical application of lead compounds significantly suppressed abscess occurrence and the MRSA burden, and also ameliorated the skin- . The biochemical assay indicated the compounds' inhibition of DNA polymerase and gyrase.  docking revealed a favorable interaction of the compounds with DNA polymerase and gyrase although the binding was not very strong. The total DNA analysis and proteomic data suggested a greater impairment of some proteins by HNF than ANF. In general, HNF and ANF were similarly potent in MRSA inhibition  and . The findings demonstrated that there was room for structural modification of furanoquinone compounds that could be used to identify anti-MRSA agent candidates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450805>Nanocarrier Lipid Composition Modulates the Impact of Pulmonary Surfactant Protein  (SP-) on Cellular Delivery of siRNA.</a></h2><p>Two decades since the discovery of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, we are now witnessing the approval of the first RNAi-based treatments with small interfering RNA (siRNA) drugs. Nevertheless, the widespread use of siRNA is limited by various extra- and intracellular barriers, requiring its encapsulation in a suitable (nanosized) delivery system. On the intracellular level, the endosomal membrane is a major  following endocytosis of siRNA-loaded nanoparticles in target cells and innovative materials to promote cytosolic siRNA delivery are highly sought after. We previously identified the endogenous lung surfactant protein  (SP-) as siRNA delivery enhancer when reconstituted in (proteo) lipid-coated nanogels. It is known that the surface-active  of SP- in the lung is influenced by the lipid composition of the lung surfactant. Here, we investigated the role of the lipid component on the siRNA delivery-promoting activity of SP- proteolipid-coated nanogels in more detail. Our results clearly indicate that SP- prefers fluid membranes with cholesterol not exceeding physiological levels. In addition, SP- retains its activity in the presence of different classes of anionic lipids. In contrast, comparable fractions of SP- did not promote the siRNA delivery potential of DOTAP:DOPE cationic liposomes. Finally, we demonstrate that the beneficial effect of lung surfactant on siRNA delivery is not limited to lung-related cell types, providing broader therapeutic opportunities in other tissues as well.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31233493>Selection and characterization of ultrahigh potency designed ankyrin repeat protein inhibitors of C. difficile toxin .</a></h2><p>Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major nosocomial disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The pathology of CDI stems primarily from the 2 C. difficile-secreted exotoxins-toxin A (TcdA) and toxin  (TcdB)-that disrupt the tight junctions between epithelial cells leading to the loss of colonic epithelial  . Here, we report the engineering of a series of monomeric and dimeric designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) for the neutralization of TcdB. The best dimeric DARPin, DLD-4, inhibited TcdB with a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 4 pM in vitro, representing an approximately 330-fold higher potency than the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anti-TcdB monoclonal antibody bezlotoxumab in the same assay. DLD-4 also protected mice from a toxin challenge in vivo. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies revealed that the 2 constituent DARPins of DLD-4-1.4E and U3-bind the central and C-terminal regions of the delivery domain of TcdB. Competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) studies showed that the DARPins 1.4E and U3 interfere with the interaction between TcdB and its receptors chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) and frizzled class receptor 2 (FZD2), respectively. Our cryo-EM studies revealed a new conformation of TcdB (both apo- and DARPin-bound at pH 7.4) in which the combined repetitive oligopeptides (CROPS) domain points away from the delivery domain. This conformation of the CROPS domain is in stark contrast to that seen in the negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) structure of TcdA and TcdB at the same pH, in which the CROPS domain bends toward and "kisses" the delivery domain. The ultrapotent anti-TcdB molecules from this study serve as candidate starting points for CDI drug development and provide new biological tools for studying the pathogenicity of C. difficile. The structural insights regarding both the "native" conformation of TcdB and the putative sites of TcdB interaction with the FZD2 receptor, in particular, should help accelerate the development of next-generation anti-C. difficile toxin therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607066>[New exploration of treatment target for proliferative diabetic retinopathy based on iTRAQ LC-MS/MS Proteomics].</a></h2><p> To identify differentially expressed proteins between the patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and vitreous floaters, and explore treatment target for PDR based on isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) LC-MS/MS Proteomics.  Vitreous samples were collected from 28 eyes of patients with PDR and 4 eyes with vitreous floaters, which served as controls. For quantitative proteomics, vitreous samples were combined and proteins extracted and labeled with iTRAQ peptide-tagging reagents. Samples were fractionated by liquid chromatography (LC), analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses performed on differentially expressed proteins identified in the PDR samples.  In the PDR vitreous, 26 proteins were identified that were differentially expressed when compared to the controls. Of these, 7 showed a significant increase (0.05) and 19 a significant decrease (0.05)in expression in PDR patients. These included some high abundance proteins including Retinoic acid receptor reactive protein 2 (PDR 1=85.0, PDR 2=83.0, Control 1=119.6, Control 2=120.2, FC=0.710, 0.001), Semaphorin-4B(PDR 1=64.4, PDR 2=68.8, Control 1=135.4, Control 2=146.0, FC=0.473, 0.023), Apolipoprotein  (PDR 1=104.4, PDR 2=106.6, Control 1=89.0, Control 2=85.3, FC=1.211, 0.024), and Heat shock protein 70 (PDR 1=69.3, PDR 2=75.0, Control 1=137.7, Control 2=138.3, FC=0.523, 0.026), which are closely related to the pathological mechanism of PDR. GO analysis clustered the differentially expressed genes into three major functional domains: Biological Processes, Molecular  and Cellular Component. Differential gene expression was found in the categories of cellular metabolism, organonitrogen compound and carbohydrate derivative metabolic processes, transferase activity and transmembrane signaling receptor activity. KEGG Pathway analysis indicate that Chemerin signaling through Akt, Sema4B signaling via PI3K, and HIF-1α signal pathways were all altered in the PDR samples.  In this study we identified variations in expression of genes extensively involved in key biological processes in the retina including neovascularization, cellular metabolism and transmembrane signaling, which provide new insights into the pathophysiology of PDR. Extracellular matrix was degraded and endothelial cell migration was induced by Chemerin, in addition, the destruction of blood-retinal  and neuronal apoptosis were induced by ApoB. Chemerin and ApoB accelerated the development of PDR. Sema 4B participated in vascular protection, HSP70 conducted anti-apoptosis. These two cytokines protected the retinal neurovascular in PDR patients. Therefore, Chemerin, Sema 4B, ApoB and HSP70 may be the treatment target for PDR. .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981282>Dysregulation of sonic hedgehog pathway and pericytes in the brain after lentiviral infection.</a></h2><p>Impairment of the blood-brain  (BBB) has been associated with cognitive decline in many CNS diseases, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Recent research suggests an important role for the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway in the maintenance of BBB integrity under both physiological and pathological conditions.In the present study, we sought to examine the expression of Shh and its downstream effectors in relation to brain pericytes and BBB integrity in HIV-infected humans and rhesus macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), an animal model of HIV infection and CNS disease. Cortical brain tissues from uninfected (n = 4) and SIV-infected macaques with (SIVE, n = 6) or without encephalitis (SIVnoE, n = 4) were examined using multi-label, semi-quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy of Shh, netrin-1, tight junction protein zona occludens 1 (ZO1), glial fibrillary acidic protein, CD163, platelet-derived growth factor receptor  (PDGFRB), glucose transporter 1, fibrinogen, and SIV Gag p28.While Shh presence in the brain persisted during HIV/SIV infection, both netrin-1 immunoreactivity and the size of PDGFRB+ pericytes, a cellular source of netrin-1, were increased around non-lesion-associated vessels in encephalitis compared to uninfected brain or brain without encephalitis, but were completely absent in encephalitic lesions. Hypertrophied pericytes were strongly localized in areas of fibrinogen extravasation and showed the presence of intracellular SIVp28 and HIVp24 by immunofluorescence in all SIV and HIV encephalitis cases examined, respectively.The lack of pericytes and netrin-1 in encephalitic lesions, in line with downregulation of ZO1 on the fenestrated endothelium, suggests that pericyte loss, despite the strong presence of Shh, contributes to HIV/SIV-induced BBB disruption and neuropathogenesis in HAND.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30905828>Hypercholesterolemia in young adult APOE mice alters epidermal lipid composition and impairs  .</a></h2><p>Long-term exposure to hypercholesterolemia induces the development of skin xanthoma's characterized by the accumulation of lipid-laden foam cells in humans and in mice.

No differences were observed on cholesterol content in the epidermis in LDLR mice nor in the more extremely hypercholesterolemic APOE mice. Interestingly, the free fatty acid profile in the APOE epidermis shifted towards shorter and unsaturated chains. Genes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids were downregulated in APOE skin suggesting a compensation for the higher influx of plasma lipids, most probably as cholesteryl esters. Importantly, in vivo transepidermal water loss and permeability studies with murine lipid model membranes revealed that the lipid composition of the APOE skin resulted in a reduced skin  .

Fiber-rich common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) promote intestinal health (microbiota and host epithelial  integrity) in lean mice. The objective was to assess the intestinal health promoting effects of navy bean supplementation during high-fat (HF)diet-induced obesity. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed either a high-fat (HF) diet (60% of kcal from fat) or an isocaloric HF diet supplemented with 15.7% (by weight) cooked navy bean powder (HF+) for 12 weeks. Compared to HF, the HF+ diet altered the fecal microbiota community structure (16S rRNA gene sequencing), most notably increasing abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila (+19-fold), whose abundance typically decreases in obese humans and rodents. Additionally, HF+ fecal abundance of carbohydrate fermenting, short chain fatty acid (SCFA) producing Prevotella (+332-fold) and S24-7 (+1.6-fold) and fecal SCFA levels were increased. HF+ improved intestinal health and epithelial  integrity versus HF, evidenced by reduced serum fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran concentration in an in vivo gut permeability test, and increased intestinal mRNA expression of tight junction components (ZO-1, occludin), anti-microbial defenses (Reg3γ, IgA, Defα5, Defβ2) and mucins (Muc2). Additionally, HF+ improved the systemic obese phenotype via reduced serum HOMA-IR and leptin:adiponectin ratio, and locally via attenuation of epididymal adipose tissue crown-like structure formation, adipocyte size, and inflammatory transcription factor (NFκBp65 and STAT3) activation. Therefore, navy bean supplementation improved obese intestinal health (microbiota and epithelial  integrity) and attenuated the severity of the obese phenotype.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, this protective  is the major hurdle for treating brain diseases such as brain tumors, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, etc. It was previously demonstrated that high pulsed electrical fields (PEFs) can disrupt the BBB by inducing electroporation (EP) which increases the permeability of the transcellular route. Our goal was to study the effects of low PEFs, well below the threshold of EP on the integrity and  of the BBB. Ten low voltage pulses (5-100 V) were applied to a human in vitro BBB model. Changes in permeability to small molecules (NaF) were studied as well as changes in impedance spectrum and trans-endothelial electric resistivity. Viability and EP were evaluated by Presto-Blue and endogenous Lactate dehydrogenase release assays. The effect on tight junction and adherent junction protein was also studied. The results of low voltage experiments were compared to high voltage experiments (200-1400 V). A significant increase in permeability was found at voltages as low as 10 V despite EP only occurring from 100 V. The changes in permeability as a  of applied voltage were fitted to an inverse-exponential , suggesting a plateau effect. Staining of VE-cadherin showed specific changes in protein expression.

DL-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects after ischemic injury. However, few studies have assessed the correlation between NBP and TJs. This study aimed to investigate the potential effect of NBP on the TJ proteins claudin-5, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and occludin during brain ischemia.A chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) Sprague-Dawley rat model was established, and NBP (20, 40, or 80 mg/kg, gavage, once a day) treatment was performed for 14 days. NBP (0.1 or 1.0 μmol/L) pre-treatment was applied to an in vitro hypoxia microvascular endothelial cell model (1% O2, 24 h). BBB permeability was assessed by performing the Evans blue assay.

The expression of P-gp and MRP2 was detected by qPCR and western blotting. The transport  of P-gp and MRP2 was measured by Rho123 and CDFDA cell uptake assay. 3. In CETAs, Hup-A at concentrations of 10 ng/mL or 2 µg/mL was transported by MDR1 and MRP2 from basolateral to apical sides of the cell monolayers. P-gp and MRP2 inhibitors completely blocked the efflux of Hup-A. There was no efflux of Hup-A in LLC-PK1 or MDCKII wild-type (WT) cells. 4. We demonstrate that Hup-A is a substrate of P-gp and MRP2. These results imply the efflux of Hup-A across the blood-brain  (BBB) , suggesting potential drug resistance of Hup-A.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31213556>Bifidobacterium dentium Fortifies the Intestinal Mucus Layer via Autophagy and Calcium Signaling Pathways.</a></h2><p>Much remains unknown about how the intestinal microbiome interfaces with the protective intestinal mucus layer.  species colonize the intestinal mucus layer and can modulate mucus production by goblet cells. However, select  strains can also degrade protective glycans on mucin proteins. We hypothesized that the human-derived species  would increase intestinal mucus synthesis and expulsion, without extensive degradation of mucin glycans.  data revealed that  lacked the enzymes necessary to extensively degrade mucin glycans.

Likewise, live -monoassociated colon had increased acidic mucin-filled goblet cells, as denoted by Periodic Acid-Schiff-Alcian Blue (PAS-AB) staining and MUC2 immunostaining. , -secreted products, including acetate, were able to increase MUC2 levels in T84 cells. We also identified that -secreted products, such as γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), stimulated autophagy-mediated calcium signaling and MUC2 release. This work illustrates that  is capable of enhancing the intestinal mucus layer and goblet cell  via upregulation of gene expression and autophagy signaling pathways, with a net increase in mucin production. Microbe-host interactions in the intestine occur along the mucus-covered epithelium. In the gastrointestinal tract, mucus is composed of glycan-covered proteins, or mucins, which are secreted by goblet cells to form a protective gel-like structure above the epithelium. Low levels of mucin or alterations in mucin glycans are associated with inflammation and colitis in mice and humans. Although current literature links microbes to the modulation of goblet cells and mucins, the molecular pathways involved are not yet fully understood. Using a combination of gnotobiotic mice and mucus-secreting cell lines, we have identified a human-derived microbe, , which adheres to intestinal mucus and secretes metabolites that upregulate the major mucin MUC2 and modulate goblet cell . Unlike other  species,  does not extensively degrade mucin glycans and cannot grow on mucin alone.

Undernutrition leads to growth stunting and/or wasting and is often associated with environmental enteric dysfunction (EED). EED mechanisms leading to growth failure include intestinal hyperpermeability, villus blunting, malabsorption and gut inflammation. As non-invasive methods for investigating gut  in undernourished children are limited, pre-clinical models are relevant to elucidating the pathophysiological processes involved in undernutrition and EED, and to identifying novel therapeutic strategies. In many published models, undernutrition was induced using protein or micronutrient deficient diets, but these experimental models were not associated with EED. Enteropathy models mainly used gastrointestinal injury triggers. These models are presented in this review. We found only a few studies investigating the combination of undernutrition and enteropathy. This highlights the need for further developments to establish an experimental model reproducing the impact of undernutrition and enteropathy on growth, intestinal hyperpermeability and inflammation, that could be suitable for preclinical evaluation of innovative therapeutic intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31278254>Small extracellular vesicles containing arginase-1 suppress T-cell responses and promote tumor growth in ovarian carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Tumor-driven immune suppression is a major  to successful immunotherapy in ovarian carcinomas (OvCa). Among various mechanisms responsible for immune suppression, arginase-1 (ARG1)-carrying small extracellular vesicles (EVs) emerge as important contributors to tumor growth and tumor escape from the host immune system. Here, we report that small EVs found in the ascites and plasma of OvCa patients contain ARG1. EVs suppress proliferation of CD4 and CD8 T-cells in vitro and in vivo in OvCa mouse models. In mice, ARG1-containing EVs are transported to draining lymph nodes, taken up by dendritic cells and inhibit antigen-specific T-cell proliferation. Increased expression of ARG1 in mouse OvCa cells is associated with accelerated tumor progression that can be blocked by an arginase inhibitor. Altogether, our studies show that tumor cells use EVs as vehicles to carry over long distances and deliver to immune cells a metabolic checkpoint molecule - ARG1, mitigating anti-tumor immune responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30891680>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens Ameliorates HO-Induced Oxidative Damage by Regulating Transporters, Tight Junctions, and Apoptosis Gene Expression in Cell Line IPEC-1.</a></h2><p>Probiotics have always been considered as a supplementary therapy for many diseases especially gut disorders. The absorption and   of the gut play a vital role in the maintenance of body homeostasis. This study was to investigate the protective effects of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SC06 (Ba) on HO-induced oxidative stress on intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-1) based on the level of gene expression. We demonstrated that Ba was a safe probiotic strain in the first place. Results showed that treatment with HO significantly increased the mRNA expression of absorptive transporters glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), Ala/Ser/Cys/Thr transporter 1 (ASCT1), and ASCT2 compared with the control group. Meanwhile, oxidative stress induced a significant improvement in the mRNA expression of occludin (OCLN) and caspase-3, and remarkably inhibited the expression of L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) or  cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), respectively. Pretreatment with Ba dramatically reversed the disturbance induced by oxidative stress on the mRNA expression of ASCT1, ASCT2, and OCLN, which also significantly prevented HO-inhibited LAT1 and Bcl-2 mRNA expression. However, Ba failed to exert any significant protective effect on GLUT2 and caspase-3 mRNA expression. We concluded that pretreatment with Ba could alleviate the damage caused by oxidative stress to a certain extent and conferred a protective effect to the intestine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297722>The effect of moderate-dose aflatoxin  and Salmonella Enteritidis infection on intestinal permeability in broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>The effect of dietary aflatoxin  (AFB) and Salmonella Enteritidis infection on intestinal permeability was investigated. Two hundred 1-day-old male Ross 308 broiler chickens were randomly divided into 4 treatments of 5 replicates each (10 birds per replicate), which were fed ad libitum for 3 weeks with the following treatments: control, chickens fed an AFB-free diet; AF, chickens fed an AFB-contaminated diet at 470 ng/g; SE, chickens fed an AFB-free diet and challenged with 10 cfu of S. Enteritidis per bird at 18 days old; AF + SE, chickens fed an AFB-contaminated diet and challenged with 10 cfu of S. Enteritidis per bird at 18 days old. At day 21 of age, chicks received an oral gavage dose of fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-dextran) to evaluate gastrointestinal leakage. Blood and intestinal samples were collected to evaluate serum biochemistry and total intestinal IgA secretion, respectively. Liver tissues were aseptically collected to assess bacterial invasiveness and for histomorphological studies. The results showed that chickens receiving AFB presented a significant increment (up to 2.4-fold) in serum FITC-dextran concentration (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, S. Enteritidis infection had no additional effect on gastrointestinal leakage. Furthermore, the ingestion of AFB had no impact on the invasive potential of S. Enteritidis. These results suggest that moderate-dose AFB adversely affects intestinal   resulting in increased gut permeability in broiler chickens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154909>Unravelled facets of milk derived opioid peptides: a focus on gut , fractures and obesity.</a></h2><p>Beyond being a source of key nutrients, bovine milk influences physiological functions by synthesising bioactive peptides during the process of digestion. Some of the claimed negative health outcomes associated with milk consumption, such as cardiovascular diseases and type 1 diabetes may be attributed to an opioid peptide, beta-casomorphin-7 (BCM-7), derived from A1 beta-casein. BCM-7 exerts its  by binding to the μ-opioid receptors in the body. It is hypothesised that activation of the μ-opioid receptors in the gut can alter gut microbial composition, impair gut  integrity and bile acid metabolism, in addition to increasing gastrointestinal transit time and gut inflammation. Further, it is hypothesised that BCM-7 may influence fractures and obesity via μ-opioid receptor pathways. In conclusion, it appears that BCM-7 might have multiple functions pertinent to human health; however, the evidence is limited and warrants further pre-clinical and clinical studies for hypothesis confirmation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31331442>Efficacy of nanoencapsulated pelargonidin in ameliorating pesticide toxicity in fish and L6 cells: Modulation of oxidative stress and signalling cascade.</a></h2><p>Removal of bio-accumulated pesticides in edible fish is a global problem. In this study, we tested protective capability of a phytochemical pelargonidin-loaded non-toxic, biodegradable poly-lactide-co-glycolide nano-particles (NPG) against toxicity induced by a pesticide cypermethrin (CM) in a fish model (Oreochromis mossambica) in vivo and also in L6 muscle cell line, in vitro. First we assessed potential sustainable release of nanoparticles following oral administration of NPG to fish, their ability to cross sub-cellular membranes in several tissues and efficacy to cross blood-brain-. Next, protective ability of NPG, if any, against CM in fish was evaluated deploying parameters like % cell viability, DNA damage in muscle cells and modulation of anti-oxidative-enzymes like superoxide dismutase, catalase and lipid peroxidase. Modulation of reactive oxygen species generation, nuclear condensation and alteration in stress related protein signalling cascade were assessed in L6 cells. Results revealed that NPG had nano-size range (~10-12 nm) and negative zeta potential (-17 mV). Bioavailability and distribution of NPG could be followed by spectrophotometric absorbance of pelargonidin at 293 nm from 6 h onward till 24 h in all important tissues including the brain. Thus, 0.5 mg/g .w. NPG could demonstrate protective ability in CM-intoxicated fish muscle cells in respect of % cell viability, DNA damage and stress related enzymes. Similar alterations could also be found in signalling protein cascade in L6 cells in response to treatment of 5 μg/ml NPG against CM-induced toxicity and depletion of overall ROS generation and nuclear condensation. Therefore, NPG could be used as a potential drug in management of pesticide toxicity in cultured edible fish.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Sequential Windowed Acquisition of All Theoretical Fragment Ion Mass Spectra (SWATH-MS) was applied to identify crucial proteins involved in HE infection. A total of 938 proteins were identified and used to generate a reference library for SWATH-MS analysis. In total, 523 proteins were reliably quantified, and 64 proteins were found to be differentially expressed, including 49 up-regulated and 15 down-regulated proteins between healthy and HE-affected intestinal mucosa. Functional analysis suggested that these proteins were involved in the following categories of cellular pathways and metabolisms: 1) energy pathways; 2) intestine lipid and amino acid metabolism; 3) oxidative stress; 4) intestinal immune response. Major findings of this study demonstrated that natural HE infection is related to the changes in abundance of several proteins involved in cell-intrinsic immune defense against viral invasion, systemic inflammation, modulation of excessive inflammation,  and T cell development and  and antigen presentation. mRNA quantitative expression demonstrated that most of the proteins involved in innate immunity that were found to be differentially abundant were produced by intestinal mucosa, suggesting its direct involvement in immune defences against HE infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Accordingly, site-specific drug delivery in the skin has been increasingly explored to facilitate the treatment of skin diseases and reduce the systemic toxicity. : An overview of the generally used sites for drug delivery in the skin is herein presented. Different strategies including particle-based carriers, physical technologies, and chemical approaches are discussed with regards to their potential application in site-specific drug delivery in the skin. : Particle-based carriers are of particular significance for the enhancement of drug delivery in the skin. Although no recommendation can be made regarding which type of carriers can provide better skin penetration, the lipid-based colloidal systems appear to be favored due to their compatibility. In addition, the physical technologies provide unique advantages in delivering hydrophilic macromolecules for the skin immunization. As a new class of permeation enhancers, skin penetrating peptides are gaining more attention in drug delivery to skin cells.

The use of probiotics in therapeutic skin applications is an attractive idea, as it could offer an alternative option for certain inflammatory skin disorders and dry or sensitive skin. Here, we investigated for the first time, a comparative study of live and the lysate products of probiotic strain Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 in skin topical applications using ex vivo skin models focusing on anti-inflammatory and skin   and in vitro assays for antimicrobial activity. Our results in ultraviolet  radiation (UVB-R)-induced inflammation model demonstrated that both live bacteria and the lysate of L. reuteri DSM 17938 reduced proinflammatory IL-6 and IL-8, illustrated in both reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) and native skin models. Live L reuteri DSM 17938 significantly increased aquaporin 3 (AQP3) gene expression, while the lysate enhanced laminin A/ levels in a healthy (unstimulated) state of RHE, suggesting a positive impact on skin .

They fulfill multiple functions across development and adulthood and under disease conditions. Current understanding revolves around microglia acquiring distinct phenotypes upon exposure to extrinsic cues in their environment. However, emerging evidence suggests that microglia display differences in their functions that are not exclusively driven by their milieu, rather by the unique properties these cells possess. This microglial intrinsic heterogeneity has been largely overlooked, favoring the prevailing view that microglia are a single-cell type endowed with spectacular plasticity, allowing them to acquire multiple phenotypes and thereby fulfill their numerous functions in health and disease. Here, we review the evidence that microglia might form a community of cells in which each member (or "subtype") displays intrinsic properties and performs unique functions. Distinctive features and functional implications of several microglial subtypes are considered, across contexts of health and disease. Finally, we suggest that microglial subtype categorization shall be based on  and we propose ways for studying them. Hence, we advocate that plasticity (reaction states) and diversity (subtypes) should both be considered when studying the multitasking microglia.© 2019 The Authors.

CVs, prepared from human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK-293), C57BL/6 mouse B16F10 skin melanoma cells (B16F10), and immortalized human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3) by liposome technology methods, were characterized for morphology, cytotoxicity, and cell uptake properties. CV brain-targeting potential was evaluated in vitro on the hCMEC/D3 blood-brain  (BBB) model, and in vivo/ex vivo. CV sizes were between 135 and 285 nm, and the -potential was negative. The dehydration-rehydration method conferred highest calcein loading and latency to CVs compared with other methods. The increased calcein leakage from CVs when compared with liposomes indicated their poor integrity, which was increased by pegylation. The in vivo results confirmed lower liver uptake by PEG-CVs (compared with nonpegylated) proving that the calcein integrity test is useful for prediction of CV biodistribution, as used for liposomes. The cell uptake of homologous origin CVs was not always higher compared with that of non-homologous. Nevertheless, CVs from hCMEC/D3 demonstrated the highest BBB permeability (in vitro) compared with OX-26 targeted liposomes, and brain localization (in vivo). CVs from hCMEC/D3 cells grown in different media demonstrated decreased interaction with brain cells and brain localization. Significant differences in proteome of the two latter CV types were identified by proteomics, suggesting a potential methodology for identification of organotropism-determining CV components.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30929532>The involvement of perivascular spaces or tissues in the facial intradermal brain-targeted delivery.</a></h2><p>Our previous work indicates the lymphatic network and perivascular spaces or tissues might be involved in the facial intradermal brain-targeted delivery of Evans blue (EB).

Whether microRNA-139 and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) are involved in the pharmacological activity of MF remain unclear. We aim to elucidate the potential  of MF in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and its possible mechanism.Twenty-four Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned into sham group, ICH group and MF group, with 8 rats in each group. Rats in ICH and MF group were subjected to ICH procedures. Rat brain tissues were harvested at 48 h after ICH procedures. Evans blue extravasation was performed to evaluate ICH-induced rat brain damage. Content of cerebral edema and neurological deficit were examined to reflect the neuronal pathological lesions. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) content in rat brain was examined by immunofluorescence. Activities of oxidative stress indexes in rat brain homogenate were detected using relative commercial kits. MicroRNA-139 expression in rat brain was quantified by quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Finally, protein levels of Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1 and nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-κ) in rat brain tissues were examined by Western blot.Compared with rats in sham group, neurological deficit scores of rats in ICH group were lower. Disruption of blood-brain  and brain tissue edema of rats were pronounced in ICH group. However, MF pretreatment markedly alleviated the above mentioned cerebral lesions. In addition, MF pretreatment increased activities of SOD, GSH and CAT, but decreased MDA and ROS contents in rat brain homogenate relative to those in ICH group (p<0.05). Western blot analysis found that expression levels of Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO-1 were markedly upregulated after MF pretreatment, while the expression level of NF-κ was downregulated. At the cellular level, we altered microRNA-139 expression in SH-SY5Y cells by transfection of microRNA-139 mimics or inhibitor. Overexpression of microRNA-139 remarkably increased Nrf2 expression and decreased NF-κ expression.

In addition to corneal transplantation, simple descemetorhexis has been proposed to treat centrally located disease with adequate peripheral cell reserve, but promoting the centripetal migration of CECs is pivotal to this strategy. Here, we show that targeting non-muscle myosin II (NMII) activity by Y27632, a ROCK inhibitor, or blebbistatin, a selective NMII inhibitor, promotes directional migration of CECs and accelerates in vitro wound healing. The lamellipodial protrusion persistence is increased, and actin retrograde flow is decreased after NMII inhibition. Counteracting lamellipodial protrusion by actin-related protein 2/3 (ARP2/3) inhibitor abolishes this migration-promoting effect. Although both Y27632 and blebbistatin accelerate wound healing, cell junctional integrity and   are better preserved after blebbistatin treatment, leading to more rapid corneal deturgescence in rabbit corneal endothelial wounding model. Our findings indicate that NMII is a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of CEC dysfunction. KEY MESSAGES: NMII inhibition promotes directional migration and wound healing of CECs in vitro. Lamellipodial protrusion persistence is increased after NMII inhibition. Selective NMII inhibitor preserves junctional integrity better than ROCK inhibitor.

They play important roles in cellular uptake of various organic compounds, and due to their expression in  tissues of major excretory and non-excretory organs are considered as crucial elements in absorption and distribution of a wide range of endobiotic and xenobiotic compounds. Based on our previous work and initial insights on SLC22 members in zebrafish (Danio rerio), in this study we aimed at in vitro characterization of Oat1 and Oat3 transporters and understanding of their interaction with potential physiological substrates. We first performed synteny analysis to describe in more detail orthological relationship of zebrafish oat1 and oat3 genes. We then developed stable cell lines overexpressing Oat1 and Oat3, and identified Lucifer yellow as Oat1 model fluorescent substrate (Km = 11.4 μM) and 6-carboxyfluorescein as Oat3 model substrate (Km = 5.8 μM). Initial identification performed using the developed assays revealed Kreb's cycle intermediates, bilirubin, bile salts and steroid hormones as the most potent of Oat1 and Oat3 interactors, with IC50 values in micromolar range. Finally, we showed that bilirubin, deoxycholic acid, α-ketoglutarate, pregnenolone, estrone-3-sulfate and corticosterone are in vitro substrates of zebrafish Oat1, and bilirubin and deoxycholic acid are Oat3 substrates. In conclusion, using the approach described, structural and functional similarities of both transporters to human and mammalian orthologs are revealed, their broad ligand selectivity confirmed, potent interactors among endobiotic compounds identified, and first indications of their potential physiological role(s) in zebrafish obtained.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Their incorporation into these products may enhance oral exposure in consumer, environmental and occupational settings. Undifferentiated and differentiated monocultures of Caco-2 cells are commonly used to assess NM toxicity to the intestine in vitro. However, the integration of other cell types into Caco-2 in vitro models increases their physiological relevance. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of CuO NMs and copper sulphate (CuSO) to intestinal microfold (M) cell (Caco-2/Raji ) and mucus secreting (Caco-2/HT29-MTX) co-culture in vitro models via assessment of their impact on  integrity, viability and interleukin (IL)-8 secretion. The translocation of CuO NMs and CuSO across the intestinal  was also investigated in vitro.CuO NMs and CuSO impaired the  of the intestinal  in the co-culture models [as indicated by a reduction in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and Zonular occludens (ZO-1) staining intensity]. Cu translocation was observed in both models but was greatest in the Caco-2/Raji  co-culture. CuO NMs and CuSO stimulated an increase in IL-8 secretion, which was greatest in the Caco-2/HT29-MTX co-culture model. CuO NMs and CuSO did not stimulate a loss of cell viability, when assessed using light microscopy, nuclei counts and scanning electron microscopy. CuO NMs demonstrated a relatively similar level of toxicity to CuO in both Caco-2/Raji  and Caco-2/HT29-MTX co- culture models.The Caco-2/Raji  co-culture model was more sensitive to CuO NM and CuSO toxicity than the Caco-2/HT29-MTX co-culture model. However, both co-culture models were less sensitive to CuO NM and CuSO toxicity than simple monocultures of undifferentiated and differentiated Caco-2 cells, which are more routinely used to investigate NM toxicity to the intestine. Obtained data can therefore feed into the design of future studies which assess the toxicity of substances (e.g. NMs) and pathogens to the intestine (e.g. by informing model and endpoint selection). However, more testing with a wider panel of NMs would be beneficial in order to help select which in vitro models and endpoints to prioritise when screening the safety of ingested NMs. Comparisons with in vivo findings will also be essential to identify the most suitable in vitro model to screen the safety of ingested NMs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670003>Injected laquinimod D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate polymeric micelles for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic relapsing disorders of the gastrointestinal tract characterized pathologically by intestinal inflammation and epithelial injury. Laquinimod (LAQ), a poorly water-soluble compound, was proved to be effective for colitis remission at low dose of 0.5 mg/kg in patients with Crohn's disease. Due to its extremely low solubility in water, it was difficult to develop an injectable liquid dosage form. Herein, D-α-Tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate (TPGS) polymeric micelles were developed as a delivery vehicle of LAQ for the management of inflammatory bowel disease. Using the LAQ/TPGS ratio of 1:100, LAQ-loaded micelles were successfully prepared by thin-film dispersion method. The solubility of LAQ in water was significantly increased from 10.5 μg/mL in pure water to 500 μg/mL in TPGS micelles. LAQ-loaded micelles of TPGS exhibited the fine particle size of 34.6 nm and Zeta potential of -0.67 mV. Moreover, the good stability of LAQ-loaded micelles in -mimicking medium was confirmed by detecting their particle size, zeta potential and leakage of the loading drug. Therapeutic effect of LAQ-loaded micelles on DSS-induced mice was proved by detecting DAI score, colon length and loss of body weight. Moreover, the morphology and colonic mucosal  of the injured colon of DSS-induced mice was largely recovered after treatment with LAQ-loaded micelles. Meanwhile, the inflammation of colitis colon was also obviously alleviated by LAQ-loaded micelles. Conclusively, polymeric micelles of TPGS may be a promising delivery vehicle of LAQ for the management of inflammatory bowel disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

The S-Sm junction with high interface transparency will then facilitate the observation of the induced hard superconducting gap, which is the key requirement to access the topological phases (TPs) and observation of exotic quasiparticles such as Majorana zero modes (MZM) in hybrid systems. A material platform that can support observation of TPs and allows the realization of complex and branched geometries is therefore highly demanding in quantum processing and computing science and technology. Here, we introduce a two-dimensional material system and study the proximity induced superconductivity in semiconducting two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) that is the basis of a hybrid quantum integrated circuit (QIC). The 2DEG is a 30 nm thick In0.75Ga0.25As quantum well that is buried between two In0.75Al0.25As barriers in a heterostructure. Niobium (Nb) films are used as the superconducting electrodes to form Nb- In0.75Ga0.25As -Nb Josephson junctions (JJs) that are symmetric, planar and ballistic. Two different approaches were used to form the JJs and QICs. The long junctions were fabricated photolithographically, but e-beam lithography was used for short junctions' fabrication. The coherent quantum transport measurements as a  of temperature in the presence/absence of magnetic field  are discussed. In both device fabrication approaches, the proximity induced superconducting properties were observed in the In0.75Ga0.25As 2DEG. It was found that e-beam lithographically patterned JJs of shorter lengths result in observation of induced superconducting gap at much higher temperature ranges. The results that are reproducible and clean suggesting that the hybrid 2D JJs and QICs based on In0.75Ga0.25As quantum wells could be a promising material platform to realize the real complex and scalable electronic and photonic quantum circuitry and devices.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569528>Syncytiotrophoblast of Placentae from Women with Zika Virus Infection Has Altered Tight Junction Protein Expression and Increased Paracellular Permeability.</a></h2><p>The cytotrophoblast of human placenta transitions into an outer multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast (STB) layer that covers chorionic villi which are in contact with maternal blood in the intervillous space. During pregnancy, the Zika virus (ZIKV) poses a serious prenatal threat. STB cells are resistant to ZIKV infections, yet placental cells within the mesenchyme of chorionic villi are targets of ZIKV infection. We seek to determine whether ZIKV can open the paracellular pathway of STB cells. This route is regulated by tight junctions (TJs) which are present in the uppermost portion of the lateral membranes of STB cells. We analyzed the paracellular permeability and expression of E-cadherin, occludin, JAMs - and -C, claudins -1, -3, -4, -5 and -7, and ZO-1, and ZO-2 in the STB of placentae from ZIKV-infected and non-infected women. In ZIKV-infected placentae, the pattern of expression of TJ proteins was preserved, but the amount of claudin-4 diminished. Placentae from ZIKV-infected women were permeable to ruthenium red, and had chorionic villi with a higher mean diameter and Hofbauer hyperplasia. Finally, ZIKV added to the basolateral surface of a trophoblast cell line reduced the transepithelial electrical resistance. These results suggest that ZIKV can open the paracellular pathway of STB cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31204548>Perspectives of patients and health-care professionals on physical activity of hospitalized patients.</a></h2><p>: A lack of physical activity during hospitalization can lead to adverse outcomes like complications and loss of physical .

To address these issues, we studied a micro-well plate-based screening method for permeability and retention that could enable the direct screening of large numbers of formulations simultaneously across human skin. Using freshly excised dermatomed human skin modified to reflect poor   and a model hydrophilic compound, Sulforhodamine  (SRB), FC permeation and retention quantification was compared to the 96-well high-throughput system (HTS). The skin was analyzed using 2-photon microscopy to determine the drug distribution within the skin. A screen of 15 different formulations in triplicate in a single piece of human skin, using full factorial design was then conducted. Permeability of SRB across the skin as well as the drug distribution profile of SRB retained in the skin were similar for the FC and HTS system. The influence of different excipients on drug retention was observed in the full factorial formulation screen. The HTS method is promising for the investigation of large numbers of formulations and the influence of formulations changes in skin retention of drug.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

We demonstrated that the Sertoli cell (SC)-specific coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CXADR) knockout (SC-CXADR), but not the GC-specific knockout, impaired spermatogenesis. An increase in GC apoptosis and premature loss of elongated spermatids were observed in SC-CXADR testes. The BTB  was compromised in SC-CXADR testes with dysregulation of oocludin and zonula occludens-1 expression at the basal compartment of the seminiferous epithelium. An integrated omics analyses confirmed that altered gene ontology terms identified in SC-CXADR testes are highly associated with spermatid development and differentiation, spermatogenesis, and sperm motility and are considered as unique testicular  terms. Leptin, Nasp, Tektin3, Larp 7, and acrosin, which are highly associated with male fertility, were found to be down-regulated in SC-CXADR testes. Based on the data from the omics analyses, we employed the CXADR-deficient SC model to further investigate the molecular mechanisms involved. We unraveled that SC-CXADRs are required for β-catenin inactivation and cell division cycle protein 42 (Cdc42) activation, resulting in maintaining the integrity and  of the BTB and apical ES as well as inhibiting gene transcription, such as the  gene, in the testes. We demonstrated for the first time that CXADR is an important mediator governing β-catenin and Cdc42 signaling that is essential for spermatogenesis.

Here, we describe the  of YW dyads in de novo designed 18-mer, β hairpins. In Peptide M, a YW dyad is formed between W14 and Y5. A UV hypochromic effect and an excitonic Cotton signal are observed, in addition to singlet, excited state (W*) and fluorescence emission spectral shifts. In a second Peptide, Peptide MW, a Y5-W13 dyad is formed diagonally across the strand and distorts the backbone. On a picosecond timescale, the W* excited-state decay kinetics are similar in all peptides but are accelerated relative to amino acids in solution. In Peptide MW, the W* spectrum is consistent with increased conformational flexibility. In Peptide M and MW, the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra obtained after UV photolysis are characteristic of tyrosine and tryptophan radicals at 160 K. Notably, at pH 9, the radical photolysis yield is decreased in Peptide M and MW, compared to that in a tyrosine and tryptophan mixture. This protective effect is not observed at pH 11 and is not observed in peptides containing a tryptophan-histidine dyad or tryptophan alone. The YW dyad protective effect is attributed to an increase in the radical recombination rate. This increase in rate can be facilitated by hydrogen-bonding interactions, which lower the  for the PCET reaction at pH 9. These results suggest that the YW dyad structural motif promotes radical quenching under conditions of reactive oxygen stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647965>ResTORing   in the skin.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31059055>Vorapaxar stabilizes permeability of the endothelial  under cholesterol stimulation via the AKT/JNK and NF‑κ signaling pathways.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis (AS) is an inflammatory disease that occurs in the arterial wall and is characterized by progressive lipid accumulation within the intima of large arteries, leading to the dysfunction of endothelial cells and further destruction of the endothelial  and vascular tone. Arterial intima injury accelerates the adhesion and activation of platelets at the injury site. The activation of platelets results in the secretion of growth factors, leading to the migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), promoting the formation of plaque, resulting in the formation of thrombus. The present study found that vorapaxar could alleviate the inflammatory response induced by a high concentration of cholesterol stimulation and increase the release of nitric oxide (NO) via the protein kinase  (AKT) signaling pathway and regulation of the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). We also found that vorapaxar could reduce the damage of DNA caused by cholesterol stimulation and regulate the cell cycle via the AKT/JNK signaling pathway and its downstream molecules glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK‑3β) and connexin 43, maintaining the integrity of the endothelial  and proliferation of endothelial cells, serving a protective role in endothelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939976>Lactobacillus fermentum species ameliorate dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis by regulating the immune response and altering gut microbiota.</a></h2><p>We evaluated immunometabolic functions of novel Lactobacillus fermentum strains (KBL374 and KBL375) isolated from feces of healthy Koreans.

OLFM4 null mice had a significant 7-d survival benefit and less intestinal  dysfunction compared with WT. Early after IR, WT mice had worse mucosal damage on histologic examination. Experiments involving adoptive transfer of bone marrow demonstrated that the mortality phenotype associated with OLFM4-positive neutrophils was transferrable to OLFM4 null mice. After IR injury, WT mice also had increased intestinal tissue activation of NFκ and expression of iNOS, 2 signaling pathways previously demonstrated to be involved in intestinal IR injury. In combination, these experiments show that OLFM4-positive neutrophils are centrally involved in the pathologic pathway leading to intestinal damage and mortality after IR injury.

In this study, the temporal and spatial expression of VEGF-D and VEGF receptors-2 and -3 (VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3, respectively) was determined at the mRNA and protein level in the rat cortical cold-injury model over a period of 0.5 to 6 days post-injury. In order to relate endothelial VEGF-D protein expression with BBB breakdown, dual labeling immunofluorescence was performed using antibodies to VEGF-D and to fibronectin, a marker of BBB breakdown. In control rats, VEGF-D signal was only observed in scattered perivascular macrophages in the cerebral cortex. The upregulation of VEGF-D mRNA expression was observed in the injury site between days 0.5 to 4, coinciding with the periods of BBB breakdown and angiogenesis. At the protein level, intracerebral vessels with BBB breakdown to fibronectin in the lesion on days 0.5 to 4 failed to show endothelial VEGF-D. Between days 0.5 to 6, increased VEGF-D immunoreactivity was noted in the endothelium of pial vessels overlying the lesion site, in neutrophils, macrophages, and free endothelial cells within the lesion. The upregulation of VEGFR-2 and -3 mRNA and protein expression was observed early post-injury on day 0.5.

Vitamin A and vitamin D deficiencies result in less diverse, dysbiotic microbial communities and increased susceptibility to infection or injury of the gastrointestinal tract. The vitamin A and vitamin D receptors are nuclear receptors expressed by the host, but not the microbiota. Vitamin A- and vitamin D-mediated regulation of the intestinal epithelium and mucosal immune cells underlies the effects of these nutrients on the microbiota.

Other shared functions of vitamin A and vitamin D include the support of innate lymphoid cells that produce IL-22, suppression of IFN-γ and IL-17 by T cells, and induction of regulatory T cells in the mucosal tissues. There are some unique functions of vitamin A and D; for example, vitamin A induces gut homing receptors on T cells, while vitamin D suppresses gut homing receptors on T cells.

Unfortunately, very few therapies can improve outcomes in patients with sepsis. Butyrate, which is the most potent histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor among short-chain fatty acids, exerts anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of inflammatory diseases. Butyrate might thus be valuable in the treatment of sepsis, in which inhibition of overwhelming cytokine release is vitally important. Sepsis was induced in 7- to 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) with a 21-g double-puncture technique. Rats received an intravenous injection of normal saline (vehicle) or sodium butyrate (200 mg/kg) after CLP and were sacrificed 12 h later. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to observe the intestinal mucosal morphology. RT-PCR and ELISA were used to determine the intestinal inflammatory response in vivo. Intestinal permeability was evaluated by measuring fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FD-4) absorption in vivo, and tight junction protein expression was examined by western blot. NF-κ p65 activities were assessed by western blot and immunohistochemistry. Sodium butyrate treatment improved the survival rate of CLP rats and alleviated sepsis-induced intestinal mucosal injury. Proinflammatory cytokine expression was lower in butyrate-treated rats than in the vehicle group. FD-4 leakage from the intestinal tract was reduced, and the expression levels of the tight junction proteins claudin-1 and ZO-1 were also restored in rats that received sodium butyrate treatment. These effects were associated with less NF-κ p65 nuclear translocation, whereas the expression of Iκ-α was not affected or even increased. Sodium butyrate mitigates the inflammatory response and maintains intestinal   in polymicrobial sepsis partly through inhibition of NF-κ activation and may serve as a novel therapy for sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31514994>Mechanical signaling in a pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell monolayer.</a></h2><p>The mechanical microenvironment of an endothelial cell includes a stable protein scaffold on the basal side, flowing blood on the apical side and contractile cells on the lateral sides. Interaction with the protein scaffold and flowing blood modulates the ability of endothelial cells to migrate, align and maintain  . Interaction with neighbors provides the endothelial monolayer unique "collective" properties. However, the nature of local mechanical signaling - i.e., the local functional consequence of a cell interacting with its contractile neighbors - remains unclear. Using an advancing sheet of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, here we examine the mechanical properties of an individual cell and its neighboring region. By combining Monolayer Stress Microscopy (MSM) with a novel analysis, we assessed several mechanical properties of an individual cell and its neighboring region. Across the monolayer, mechanical properties of the neighboring region defined multicellular "subdivisions" wherein constituent cells were exposed to a similar mechanical microenvironment. Adjacent subdivisions were separated by a narrow interface where adjoining cells were exposed to remarkably different mechanical microenvironments. Comparison of temporal fluctuations in mechanical properties of individual cells and those of their neighboring regions suggested three distinct intercellular mechanical signaling processes. These processes indicated that change in size, shape and speed of individual cells is associated with change in contractile forces in their neighboring regions. In summary, we present a novel approach to assess the mechanical interactions of individual cells with their contractile neighbors and identify potential functional consequences of such interactions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Total dependence on parenteral nutrition (PN) is associated with numerous adverse effects, including severe microbial dysbiosis and loss of important butyrate producers. We hypothesised that a lack of butyrate produced by the gut microbiota may be compensated by its supplementation in PN mixtures. We tested whether  butyrate administration would (a) positively modulate intestinal defence mechanisms and () counteract PN-induced dysbiosis. Male Wistar rats were randomised to chow, PN, and PN supplemented with 9 mM butyrate (PN+But) for 12 days. Antimicrobial peptides, mucins, tight junction proteins, and cytokine expression were assessed by RT-qPCR. T-cell subpopulations in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were analysed by flow cytometry. Microbiota composition was assessed in caecum content. Butyrate supplementation resulted in increased expression of tight junction proteins (), antimicrobial peptides (), and lysozyme in the ileal mucosa. Butyrate partially alleviated PN-induced intestinal  impairment and normalised IL-4, IL-10, and IgA mRNA expression. PN administration was associated with an increase in Tregs in MLN, which was normalised by butyrate. Butyrate increased the total number of CD4+ and decreased a relative amount of CD8+ memory T cells in MLN. Lack of enteral nutrition and PN administration led to a shift in caecal microbiota composition. Butyrate did not reverse the altered expression of most taxa but did influence the abundance of some potentially beneficial/pathogenic genera, which might contribute to its overall beneficial effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583949>Enteric bacteria induce IFNγ and Granzyme  from human colonic Group 1 Innate Lymphoid Cells.</a></h2><p>Group 1 Innate Lymphoid Cells (which include Natural Killer cells and ILC1s) aid in gut anti-bacterial defense through the production of IFNγ, which is critical for mobilizing protective responses against enteric pathogens. When intestinal epithelial  integrity is compromised, commensal bacteria are likely to translocate from the gut lumen into the lamina propria. Few studies have addressed the mechanisms by which commensal bacteria impact the  of gut Group 1 ILCs, especially ILC1s. Utilizing an  human colonic lamina propria mononuclear cell (LPMC) model, we evaluated Group 1 ILC cytokine and cytolytic protein production in response to a panel of enteric Gram-positive and Gram-negative commensal and pathogenic bacteria. IFNγ-production by NK cells and ILC1s was significantly increased after LPMC exposure to Gram-negative commensal or pathogenic bacteria, but not after exposure to the Gram-positive bacteria commensals tested. Stimulation of IFNγ production from Group 1 ILCs was not through direct recognition of bacteria by NK cells or ILC1s, but rather required accessory cells within the LPMC population. Myeloid dendritic cells generated IL-12p70, IL-18, and IL-1β upon exposure to enteric bacteria and these cytokines contributed to Group 1 ILC production of IFNγ. Furthermore, Gram-negative commensal or pathogenic bacteria induced significant expression of Granzyme  in NK cells and ILC1s. Overall, these data demonstrate that some enteric commensal bacteria indirectly induce inflammatory cytokine production and cytolytic protein expression from human colonic Group 1 ILCs, a process which could contribute to inflammation in the setting of microbial translocation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30951820>Pharmacological characterization of the 3D MucilAir™ nasal model.</a></h2><p>The preclinical evaluation of nasally administered drug candidates requires screening studies based on in vitro models of the nasal mucosa. The aim of this study was to evaluate the morpho-functional characteristics of the 3D MucilAir™ nasal model with a pharmacological focus on [ATP]-binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporters. We initially performed a phenotypic characterization of the MucilAir™ model and assessed its  properties by immunofluorescence (IF), protein mass spectrometry and examination of histological sections. We then focused on the functional expression of the ABC transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP)1, MRP2 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in bidirectional transport experiments. The MucilAir™ model comprises a tight, polarized, pseudo-stratified nasal epithelium composed of fully differentiated ciliated, goblet and basal cells. These ABC transporters were all expressed by the cell membranes. P-gp and BCRP were both functional and capable of actively effluxing substrates. The MucilAir™ model could consequently represent a potent tool for evaluating the interaction of nasally administered drugs with ABC transporters.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

This transporter uses energy of ATP hydrolysis to efflux from cells a variety of structurally dissimilar hydrophobic and amphipathic compounds, including anticancer drugs. In this regard, understanding the interaction with P-gp of drug entities in development is important and highly recommended in current US Food and Drug Administration guidelines. Here we tested the P-gp interaction of some A adenosine receptor agonists that are being developed for the treatment of chronic diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, chronic pain, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Biochemical assays of the ATPase activity of P-gp and by photolabeling P-gp with its transport substrate [I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin led to the identification of rigidified (N)-methanocarba nucleosides (i.e., compound  as a stimulator and compound  as a partial inhibitor of P-gp ATPase activity). Compound  significantly inhibited boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY)-verapamil transport mediated by human P-gp (IC 2.4 ± 0.6 M); however, the BODIPY-conjugated derivative of  (compound ) was not transported by P-gp. In silico docking of compounds  and  was performed using the recently solved atomic structure of paclitaxel (Taxol)-bound human P-gp. Molecular modeling studies revealed that both compounds  and  bind in the same region of the drug-binding pocket as Taxol. Thus, this study indicates that nucleoside derivatives can exhibit varied modulatory effects on P-gp activity, depending on structural functionalization. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Certain A adenosine receptor agonists are being developed for the treatment of chronic diseases. The goal of this study was to test the interaction of these agonists with the human multidrug resistance-linked transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). ATPase and photolabeling assays demonstrated that compounds with rigidified (N)-methanocarba nucleosides inhibit the activity of P-gp; however, a fluorescent derivative of one of the compounds was not transported by P-gp. Furthermore, molecular docking studies revealed that the binding site for these compounds overlaps with the site for paclitaxel in the drug-binding pocket.

Based on computational docking studies, transcriptional activation experiments and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein immunofluorescence localization assays in cultured cells, 16α-hydroxytrametenolic acid (HTA) was discovered as a novel GR agonist in this study. HTA ameliorates TNF-α-induced Caco-2 monolayer intestinal epithelial  damage and suppressed activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase  (Akt), which attenuated downstream Iκ and nuclear factor kappa- (NF-κ) phosphorylation through GR activation.

GCs are one of the main therapy choices for the exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease, but they are not useful to prolong remission, and development of tolerance with secondary treatment failure is frequent. Thus, GC actions at the intestinal epithelial level are of great importance, both physiologically and pharmacologically.

Binding of hsa-miR-375 to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was verified by the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Changes in the viability and apoptosis in Caco-2 cells influenced by hsa-miR-375 were examined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The regulatory effect of hsa-miR-375 on the intestinal epithelial  was examined by detecting transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and lucifer yellow flux. Relative levels of TLR4, nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-κ), zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin and inflammatory factors in Caco-2 cells were detected by qRT-PCR, Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Hsa-miR-375 was downregulated in intestinal mucosa tissues of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Knockdown of hsa-miR-375 decreased viability and TEER, but elevated apoptotic rate and lucifer yellow flux. Overexpression of hsa-miR-375 achieved the opposite trends. TLR4 was the direct downstream of hsa-miR-375, and its level was negatively mediated by hsa-miR-375. In addition, TLR4 level in Caco-2 cells was upregulated after LPS induction, while hsa-miR-375 level was unchangeable.

Here we showed that vitamin D/vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling regulates gut ILC3. VDR deletion or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D deficiency in mice led to a marked reduction in colonic ILC3 populations at steady state and impaired ILC3 responses following Citrobacter rodentium infection, resulting in substantial increases in intestinal bacterial growth and mouse mortality. VDR regulation of ILC3 was independent of T and  lymphocytes or gut microflora. Correction of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D deficiency rescued the ILC3 defects. Mechanistically, VDR deletion or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D deficiency markedly reduced colonic Ki67 ILC3 populations, and in vivo and in vitro studies confirmed that vitamin D hormone directly stimulated ILC3 proliferation. Therefore, vitamin D/VDR signaling is required for ILC3-mediated innate immunity through regulation of ILC3 proliferation.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

During a mean follow-up of 121.9 months, graft loss occurred in 6/36 (17%) of the sensitized and 15/251 (6%) of the non-sensitized recipients (P = 0.021). Five-year and 10-year death-censored graft survival rates were 85% and 81% compared to 95% and 92%, respectively, for the non-sensitized recipients. There was no difference in recipients' survival. Slightly more episodes of acute rejection occurred in the sensitized group but had not influence on graft survival. At the last follow-up, 28 recipients had functioning graft; seventeen (47%) did not have detectable DSA.

We report distinct classes of lUSVs that can be assigned to different emotional states; relaxation vs. frustration. Totally flat, 22-kHz calls (Class A), were observed during the relaxation state following ejaculation; characterized by immobilization or grooming during the PEI. On the other hand, two-three component lUSVs (Class ) that start at a higher frequency (45-kHz: flat, upward or short signal) and then shift to 35-23-kHz (mostly to 28-23-kHz), correspond as we assume, to arousal and frustration - active states associated with sniffing a hole or exploration during the NC test. We suggest that momentary, abrupt decreases of arousal during the frustration state correspond to Class  lUSVs. The detailed spectral analysis of the high-frequency component of two-component lUSVs is crucial for establishing the relationship between such lUSVs and the corresponding behavior and emotional states. Our studies indicate that while the two-component Class  22-kHz lUSVs may relate to the frustration state, a single component, flat, Class A lUSV relates to the relaxation state.

GSH-PEG liposomal MTX based on hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine (HSPC) or egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (EYPC) and their corresponding PEG control liposomes were prepared. The brain delivery of MTX after intravenously administering free MTX, four liposomal formulations or free MTX + empty GSH-PEG-HSPC liposomes was evaluated by performing microdialysis in brain interstitial fluid and blood. Compared to free MTX with a steady-state unbound brain-to-plasma concentration ratio (K) of 0.10, PEG-HSPC liposomes did not affect the brain uptake of MTX, while PEG-EYPC liposomes improved the uptake (K 1.5, p < 0.05). Compared to PEG control formulations, GSH-PEG-HSPC liposomes increased brain delivery of MTX by 4-fold (K 0.82, p < 0.05), while GSH-coating on PEG-EYPC liposomes did not result in a further enhancement in uptake. The co-administration of empty GSH-PEG-HSPC liposomes with free MTX did not influence the uptake of MTX into the brain. This work showed that the brain-targeting effect of GSH-PEG liposomal MTX is highly dependent on the liposomal formulation that is combined with GSH, providing insights on formulation optimization of this promising brain delivery platform.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

This catalytic cycle proceeds via cleavage of a Co-C bond which is formally heterolytic. This cleavage results in a structural change in the MeCbl cofactor bound to an enzyme. Unlike the native catalysis, upon photoexcitation, the Co-C bond in MeCbl-bound MetH generates the Co(ii)/CH3 radical pairs (RPs). Protein residues of the cap domain, particularly phenylalanine708 (F708) and leucine 715 (L715), which surrounds the upper face of the MeCbl cofactor, inhibit the photolysis of MeCbl by caging the CH3 radical and inducing the geminate recombination of the Co(ii)/CH3 RP. A molecular-level understanding of these effects requires a detailed investigation of the low-lying electronic states. Toward this, we have mutated the F708 residue with alanine (A708) and constructed the potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the low-lying S1 electronic state using a combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approach. The S1 PESs for the wild-type (WT) and mutant enzymes are the result of crossing of two electronic states, namely metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) and ligand field (LF) states, indicated by a seam. It is shown that the topologies of the S1 PESs are significantly modulated by introducing a mutation at the F708 position. Specifically, for the WT enzyme, the energy  of photoreaction and the energy difference between MLCT and LF minima are markedly higher than those of its mutant counterpart. Moreover, mutation influences the photoactivation of the Co-C bond in enzyme-bound MeCbl by decreasing the rate of geminate recombination and altering the rate of radical pair formation. This theoretical insight was also compared with transient absorption spectroscopic (TAS) studies which are in good agreement with the present findings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665283>Deficient Resident Memory T-Cell and Cd8 T-Cell Response to Commensals in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Aims: The intestinal microbiota is closely associated with resident memory lymphocytes in mucosal tissue. We sought to understand how acquired cellular and humoral immunity to the microbiota differ in health versus inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Resident memory T-cells (Trm) in colonic biopsies and local antibody responses to intraepithelial microbes were analyzed. Systemic antigen-specific immune T- and -cell memory to a panel of commensal microbes was assessed.Systemically, healthy blood showed CD4 and occasional CD8 memory T-cell responses to selected intestinal bacteria but few memory -cell responses. In IBD, CD8 memory T-cell responses decreased although -cell responses and circulating plasmablasts increased. Possibly secondary to loss of systemic CD8 T-cell responses in IBD, dramatically reduced numbers of mucosal CD8+ Trm and γδ T-cells were observed. IgA responses to intraepithelial bacteria were increased. Colonic Trm expressed CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases, characteristic of regulatory T-cells. Cytokines/factors required for Trm differentiation were identified, and in vitro-generated Trm expressed regulatory T-cell  via CD39. Cognate interaction between T-cells and dendritic cells induced T-bet expression in dendritic cells, a key mechanism in regulating cell-mediated mucosal responses.A previously unrecognized imbalance exists between cellular and humoral immunity to the microbiota in IBD, with loss of mucosal T-cell-mediated  immunity and uncontrolled antibody responses. Regulatory  of Trm may explain their association with intestinal health. Promoting Trm and their interaction with dendritic cells rather than immunosuppression may reinforce tissue immunity, improve   and prevent -cell dysfunction in microbiota-associated disease and IBD etiology.© European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585052>Soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) regulates calcium signaling in the vascular endothelium.</a></h2><p>The vascular endothelium acts as a selective  between the bloodstream and extravascular tissues. Intracellular [Ca] signaling is essential for vasoactive agonist-induced stimulation of endothelial cells (ECs), typically including Ca release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although it is known that interactions of Ca and cAMP as ubiquitous messengers are involved in this process, the individual contribution of cAMP-generating adenylyl cyclases (ACs), including the only soluble AC (sAC; ADCY10), remains less clear. Using life-cell microscopy and plate reader-based [Ca] measurements, we found that human immortalized ECs, primary aortic and cardiac microvascular ECs, and primary vascular smooth muscle cells treated with sAC-specific inhibitor KH7 or anti-sAC-small interfering RNA did not show endogenous or exogenous ATP-induced [Ca] elevation. Of note, a transmembrane AC (tmAC) inhibitor did not prevent ATP-induced [Ca] elevation in ECs. Moreover, l-phenylephrine-dependent constriction of  mouse aortic ring segments was also reduced by KH7. Analysis of the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP) pathway revealed reduced IP receptor phosphorylation after KH7 application, which also prevented [Ca] elevation induced by IP receptor agonist adenophostin A.

Consistently, Ochratoxin A (OTA) ingestion has been found to induce intestinal injuries, including inflammation and diarrhea. However, little is known whether OTA aggravates DON-induced toxicity. This study is designed to explore the effects of OTA on DON-induced intestinal   and involved mechanism. Our results showed either DON or OTA could disrupt intestinal   in a time- and dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by decreased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and increased paracellular permeability to 4 kDa dextran. However, to eliminate the involvement of cell death, nonlethal concentrations of DON and OTA were used in following experiments. The nontoxic concentration of OTA was observed to aggravate DON-induced intestinal  dysfunction, accompanied with tight junction disruption (Claudin-3 and Claudin-4). Moreover, nontoxic concentrations of OTA aggravated DON-induced up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines expression and activated nuclear factor-κ (NF-κ) in IPEC-J2 cells. Adding NF-κ inhibitor (PDTC) alleviated the aggravating effects of nontoxic concentrations of OTA on DON-induced intestinal  dysfunction and inflammation. These findings indicate that nontoxic concentrations of OTA promoted DON-induced  dysfunction via NF-κ signaling pathway. Our experiment suggests that exposure to nontoxic concentrations of toxins also poses potentially harmful effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Rapid clearance, mucosal coating, and tight epithelium create strong natural barriers that reduce the effectiveness of many pharmacological interventions in the bladder. Intravesical drug delivery (IDD) is the administration of therapeutic compounds or devices to the urinary bladder via a urethral catheter. Previous work in improving IDD for IC has focused on the sustained delivery of analgesics within the bladder and other small molecule drugs which do not address underlying inflammation and bladder damage. Therapeutic glycosaminoglycans (GAG)  by restoring the mucosal  within the bladder, promoting healing responses, and preventing irritating solutes from reaching the bladder wall. There is an unmet medical need for a therapy that provides both acute relief of symptoms while alleviating underlying physiological sources of inflammation and promoting healing within the urothelium. Semi-synthetic glycosaminoglycan ethers (SAGE) are an emerging class of therapeutic GAG with intrinsic anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. To reduce SAGE clearance and enhance its accumulation in the bladder, we developed a silk-elastinlike protein polymer (SELP) based system to enhance SAGE IDD. We evaluated in vitro release kinetics, rheological properties, impact on bladder , pain response, and bladder inflammation and compared their effectiveness to other temperature-responsive polymers including Poloxamer 407 and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol). SAGE delivered via SELP-enhanced intravesical delivery substantially improved SAGE accumulation in the urothelium, provided a sustained analgesic effect 24 h after administration, and reduced inflammation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Under homeostatic conditions, immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the major immunoglobulin isotype in the intestinal mucosa. Microbes stimulate the production of IgA, which controls bacterial translocation and neutralizes bacterial toxins at the intestinal mucosal surface. In the intestinal mucosa, dendritic cells (DCs), specialized antigen-presenting cells, regulate both T-cell-dependent (TD) and -independent (TI) immune responses. The intestinal DCs are a heterogeneous population that includes unique subsets that induce IgA synthesis in  cells. The characteristics of intestinal DCs are strongly influenced by the microenvironment, including the presence of commensal bacterial metabolites and epithelial cell-derived soluble factors. In this review, we summarize the ontogeny, classification, and  of intestinal DCs and how the intestinal microenvironment conditions DCs and their precursors to become the mucosal phenotype, in particular to regulate IgA production, after they arrive at the intestine. Understanding the mechanism of IgA synthesis could provide insights for designing effective mucosal vaccines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30999045>Post-irradiation recovery time strongly influences fractional laser-facilitated skin absorption.</a></h2><p>Fractional CO laser treatment has been used in some clinical trials to promote topical drug delivery. Currently, there is no standard for laser settings to achieve a feasible therapy. The cutaneous recovery following laser treatment and its influence on drug absorption have not been well explored. This study evaluated the kinetics of laser-treated skin- restoration and drug permeation in nude mice. The skin recovery and observation of the process were characterized by transdermal water loss (TEWL), erythema measurement, gross appearance, optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The skin absorption of a lipophilic small permeant (tretinoin), a hydrophilic small permeant (acyclovir), and a large molecule (fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran 4 kDa, FD4) was examined in vitro using Franz cell. TEWL suggested that the laser-treated skin restored its   at 16 h after irradiation. The fractional laser produced microchannels of about 150 μm in diameter and 25 μm in depth that were surrounded with thermal coagulation. The bright-field imaging indicated that the micropores were progressively closed during the recovery period but had not completely closed even after a 16-h recovery. The laser treatment led to a rapid tretinoin penetration across the skin immediately after irradiation, with a 5-fold enhancement compared to intact skin. This enhancement was gradually reduced following the increase of recovery time. Conversely, the acyclovir and FD4 permeation peaked at 1-2 h post-irradiation. The FD4 flux was even elevated as the recovery time increased. The reasons for this could have been the subsequent inflammation after laser exposure and the deficient tight junction (TJ) . The confocal imaging demonstrated the perpendicular diffusion of rhodamine  and FD4 through microchannels immediately after laser exposure. The lateral diffusion from the microchannels was observed at 2 h post-irradiation. Our results revealed a time-dependent recovery of skin permeation. The time frame for applying the drugs after laser irradiation was dependent upon the permeants and their various physicochemical properties.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Alterations in the composition of intestinal flora (dysbiosis) could be associated with an impaired intestinal epithelium  activity and an impaired mucosal immunity , significantly contributing to microbial translocation which is considered a major driver of chronic immune activation. : This article provides an overview on the novel trends in  therapy application. A particular emphasis is addressed to the importance of probiotics as a novel strategy to attenuate or prevent gastrointestinal involvement and to improve gut-mucosal immunity in HIV-infected subjects. Therefore, opportunities, limits and methodological criticalities of supplementation with probiotic therapy are considered and analyzed. : Use of  is  as a novel strategy to manage dysbiosis and gut-mucosal impairment, to reduce immune activation and to limit a number of non-AIDS-related disorders.

Consequently, both brain damage and neurodegenerative diseases often cause functional impairment for patients. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), one type of adult stem cells, can be isolated from various adult tissues. MSCs have been used in clinical trials to treat human diseases and the therapeutic potentials of the MSC-derived secretome and extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been under investigation. We found that blocking the prostaglandin E /prostaglandin E receptor 4 (PGE /EP ) signaling pathway in MSCs with EP antagonists increased EV release and promoted the sorting of specific proteins, including anti-inflammatory cytokines and factors that modify astrocyte , blood-brain  integrity, and microglial migration into the damaged hippocampus, into the EVs. Systemic administration of EP antagonist-elicited MSC EVs repaired deficiencies of cognition, learning and memory, inhibited reactive astrogliosis, attenuated extensive inflammation, reduced microglial infiltration into the damaged hippocampus, and increased blood-brain  integrity when administered to mice following hippocampal damage.

Approach and Results- Here, we create a new mouse model allowing spatiotemporal investigations of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by induced overexpression of Axin1, an inhibitor of β-catenin signaling, specifically in endothelial cells ( Axin1 - ). AOE (Axin1 overexpression) in Axin1 -  mice at stages following the initial vascular invasion of the CNS did not impair angiogenesis but led to premature vascular regression followed by progressive dilation and inhibition of vascular maturation resulting in forebrain-specific hemorrhage 4 days post-AOE. Analysis of the temporal Wnt/β-catenin driven CNS vascular development in zebrafish also suggested that Axin1 -  led to CNS vascular regression and impaired maturation but not inhibition of ongoing angiogenesis within the CNS. Transcriptomic profiling of isolated, β-catenin signaling-deficient endothelial cells during early blood-brain -development (E11.5) revealed ECM (extracellular matrix) proteins as one of the most severely deregulated clusters. Among the 20 genes constituting the forebrain endothelial cell-specific response signature, 8 ( Adamtsl2, Apod, Ctsw, Htra3, Pglyrp1, Spock2, Ttyh2, and Wfdc1) encoded bona fide ECM proteins. This specific β-catenin-responsive ECM signature was also repressed in Axin1 -  and endothelial cell-specific β-catenin-knockout mice ( Ctnnb1-KO) during initial blood-brain  maturation (E14.5), consistent with an important role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in orchestrating the development of the forebrain vascular ECM. Conclusions- These results suggest a novel mechanism of establishing a CNS endothelium-specific ECM signature downstream of Wnt-β-catenin that impact spatiotemporally on blood-brain  differentiation during forebrain vessel development.

In addition, it can increase insulin sensitivity, decrease blood glucose level and inhibit the apoptosis of endothelial cells. However, it remains unclear whether CTRP9 has beneficial effects on diabetic retinopathy (DR). An adenoviral vector expressing CTRP9 was intravenously injected into db/db mice, aged 12 weeks, at day 15 post injection, and the process was repeated. The transfection efficiency of CTRP9 was assessed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. We used RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and Western blot to determine proinflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules and tight-junction proteins. The breakdown of blood-retinal  (BRB) was evaluated using Evans blue and retinal staining. CTRP9 suppresses the expression of interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and adhesion molecules in the retina of db/db mice. CTRP9 can balance the expression of pigment epithelium-derived factor and vascular endothelial growth factor. CTRP9 can also inhibit the activation of nuclear factor Kappa  in the retina of db/db mouse. In addition, CTRP9 can prevent the breakdown of BRB and downregulation of tight-junction proteins in the retina of db/db mice. Evans blue assay revealed the breakdown of BRB and vascular leakage in the retinas of diabetic mice. CTRP9 can both qualitatively and quantitatively alleviate the vascular leakage in the early stage of diabetic retinas. CTRP9 can inhibit the inflammation of diabetic retinopathy and protect blood-retinal  via decreasing proinflammatory cytokines and preventing the downregulation of tight-junction proteins.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

In this study, SKOV3/T4, a metastatic subpopulation of ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells, was enriched to explore potential interventions against metastatic-associated drug resistance. Quantitative genomic and functional analyses were performed and found that slug was significantly increased in the SKOV3/T4 subpopulation and contributed to the high resistance of SKOV3/T4. Further studies showed that slug activated c-Met in a ligand-independent manner due to elevated levels of fibronectin and provoked integrin  V , which was confirmed by the significant correlation of slug and p-Met levels in 121 ovarian cancer patient samples. Intriguingly, c-Met inhibitor(s) exhibited greatly enhanced anti-cancer effects in slug-positive ovarian cancer models both  and . Additionally, IHC analyses revealed that slug levels were highly correlated with reduced survival of ovarian cancer patients.

Obviously, direct sampling from early embryos is damaging. Therefore, we detected changes in the concentrations of 30 signaling molecules in serum from the pregnant rats at the 14 time points, then the intercellular wireless communication network was established, to explore the regularity of signal communication between mother and fetus.We used liquid chip scanning technology to detect 30 signal molecules at 14 time points. Statistical analysis of the data yielded significant change signal molecules. According to the secretory cells and effector cells involved in signal molecules, the communication network of different stages were drawn by using Biograph software.The process could be divided into 4 periods including early, middle, late pregnancy, and postpartum. In early pregnancy, two immune transformations occur: (a) interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-13 (IL-13) increased at day 5, which promoted immunoglobin G (IgG) secretion, provided protection through the neonatal Fc receptor for IgG (FcγRn) crossing the placental  to reach the embryo, achieved T helper 1 (Th1) transformation into T helper 2 (Th2), reduced maternal innate and cellular immunity, and prevented fetal abortion; () the fetal heart was fully developed at day 7, with circulatory system established, which provided a platform for intercellular information exchange. The second transformation corresponded to the maternal immune system providing signaling molecules for the embryo to promote Th2 transformation into Th1, thus activating embryonic innate immune cells, and enabling antibody-mediated immune recognition, response and protection. Days 9-19 was a stable period. After 21 days of pregnancy, the maternal body prepared for delivery.

In the fabrication of AuNPs, Resveratrol acts as both stabilizing and reducing agent. The prepared AuNPs is tested on streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats for their amelioration consequence. The images of TEM displayed the development of spherical nanoparticles (NPs) with a median of 20 nm particle size. The STZ injected diabetic rats were administrated orally with calcium dobesilate (CD; 500 mg/kg/day) or AuNPs (200, 300 mg/kg/day) for a period of 3 months. The characteristics displayed by AuNPs were found to be similar with CD in decreasing permeability of blood-retinal  in STZ injected diabetic rats. The retinal vessels in the AuNPs administrated diabetic rats were observed to be decreased through the retinal histopathological examination. In the AuNPs administrated diabetic rats, the retinal expression of renal Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor (PEDF) was observed to be increased and the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF-1), which was increased in diabetic rats was declined on treating with AuNPs. On treating the STZ injected diabetic rats with AuNPs, all the retinal mRNA expressions of VEGF-1, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNFα), Monocyte Chemotactic Proteins-1 (MCP-1), Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β were observed to be reduced. Furthermore, AuNPs can reduce phosphorylation of Nuclear Factor Kappa  (NF-κ) p65 and Extracellular signal Regulated Kinase (ERK) 1/2 along with a growth in nuclear translocation of pNF-κ p65 produced by STZ. To conclude, the protective effect of AuNPs on STZ injected diabetic rats could help in redeveloping the balance among the inhibitors and stimulators of angiogenesis. Furthermore, on treating with AuNPs results in inhibiting the signaling pathway of ERK1/2 as well as with amelioration of retinal inflammation through trans repression of NF-κ.Copyright © 2019.

Therefore, the identification of an alternative donor with a lower risk of GVHD is important for patients lacking an HLA-identical sibling donor. To date, HLA studies of large cohorts of unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (UR-HSCT) have provided important and helpful information for donor selection. In UR-HSCT through Japan Marrow Donor Program, patient and donor HLA-A, -, and -C, and HLA-DRB1 and -DQB1 double mismatches are significant risk factors for severe GVHD and mortality. HLA-DPB1 mismatch does not affect survival; however, it reduces the chances of leukemia relapse. In the analysis of a specific allele effect on transplant outcomes, HLA-C14:02 was significantly associated with an increased risk of severe acute GVHD. The development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled full-length HLA allele typing. Evolutionary analysis of the entire HLA-DPB1 revealed that a highly conserved region from exon 3 to 3'UTR provoked acute GVHD that was different from a T-cell epitope mismatching algorithm, reflecting exon 2 polymorphisms. Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated the importance of full-length NGS HLA typing on UR-HSCT outcomes.

The deep capillary plexus OCTA images and the corresponding EnFace OCT images, both acquired with the same automatic segmentation, had been overlapped to compose RGB color images as red and green channels, respectively, using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Afterward, linear regions of interest were traced on the color images to obtain the profiles of OCTA and EnFace gray values. Number of pixels, mean gray value and standard deviation of the area traced in OCT-A, and EnFace image were analyzed and statistically correlated. Data were exported to Excel to create the plots.94 patients with DME and 27 patients with RVO showed intraretinal macular cystoid spaces with similar homogeneous, gray-looking content; 73 patients with DME and 113 patients with RVO showed macular cystoid spaces with homogeneous, black-looking content, as observed at SD-OCT, EnFace and OCTA scans. Interestingly, the limits of macular cystoid spaces were clearly detectable with OCTA. The analysis of red and green profiles demonstrated a clearly visible overlap between average OCTA and EnFace signal observed around cystoid spaces that could be attributed to a relationship between the dynamic vascularization and the structural density of the tissue.This is the first investigation that characterizes and correlates OCTA and EnFace signals on images of macular cystoid spaces in DR and RVO. The low intensity OCTA signals observed inside cystoid spaces raise a relevant question about their nature, as to whether they are due to the presence of corpusculated material pouring out from bloodocular- or they should be considered OCTA artifacts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31472180>The protective effect of lithocholic acid on the intestinal epithelial  is mediated by the vitamin D receptor via a SIRT1/Nrf2 and NF-κ dependent mechanism in Caco-2 cells.</a></h2><p>Lithocholic acid (LCA) is both a secondary bile acid and a vitamin D receptor (VDR) ligand. The VDR is activated by 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and plays an important role in maintaining integrity of the intestinal mucosal . LCA can also substitute for vitamin D to carry out the in vivo functions of vitamin D. However, it is unclear whether activation of the VDR by LCA affects mucosal  . In the present study, we researched the protective effect of LCA on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced intestinal epithelial  dysfunction in Caco-2 cells of the human epithelial intestinal adenocarcinoma cell line. Caco-2 cell monolayers were pretreated with LCA and then exposed to 100 ng/mL TNF-α. The results showed that LCA alleviated the decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and the increase in FITC-Dextran flux induced by TNF-α. LCA ameliorated the TNF-α-induced decrease in protein expression and distribution of ZO-1, E-cadherin, Occludin, and Claudin-1, which are tight junction markers. Additionally, the LCA treatment effectively counteracted TNF-α-mediated downregulation of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase-1, which are related to oxidative stress. Increases in NF-κ p-p65 and p-Iκ-α induced by TNF-α were significantly inhibited by LCA.

The aim of this study was to explore the effects of CIRBP on intestinal  during DHCA.Sprague-Dawley (wild type, n = 13) and knockout of Cirbp (Cirbp-/-, n = 8) rats were used in the model of DHCA. The histomorphology of the epithelial  was evaluated by haematoxylin-eosin, Chiu's scores, Gram's stain and Ki67. The  of the intestinal  was evaluated by serum intestinal fatty acid-binding protein, diamine oxidase and d-lactate. The structure of the epithelial , phosphocreatine-creatine kinase system and adenosine triphosphate were assessed in the intestine.The expression of CIRBP significantly increased in the intestine during DHCA. Cirbp-/- rats showed obvious destruction of intestinal  after DHCA. Chiu's scores, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein, diamine oxidase and d-lactate significantly increased in the Cirbp-/- group. Ki67 showed that cell proliferation decreased in the Cirbp-/- rats. In the Cirbp-/- group, zonula occludens-1, E-cadherin and occludin levels were significantly decreased, and these proteins either disappeared or redistributed in the monolayer. Besides, Cirbp-/- resulted in decreased levels of creatine kinase , glycine amidinotransferase, adenosine triphosphate and creatine contents in the intestine, affecting energy metabolism and balance, which is associated with the maintenance of epithelial  during acute injury.CIRBP is related to the maintenance of the intestinal epithelial  during DHCA, which is expected to be a new target for the prevention of intestinal injury.© The Author(s) 2019.

The precise understanding of protein dimerization is a prerequisite for manipulating protein aggregation, which is promising for elevating enzyme concentration to enhance their catalytic performance. Here, the dimerization of two industrially important enzymes of cytochrome P450 (P450) and organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH) is investigated using all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations, umbrella sampling, and protein-protein docking calculations.

The docking calculations on the OPH dimer evidence the uniqueness of the native orientation. The protein dimers form "mirror"-like orientations with some degree of rotation.

Using intravital microscopy, we measured the perfused boundary region (PBR), an inverse parameter of eGC dimensions in sublingual microvessels, in patients with sepsis and age-matched nonseptic subjects. Median PBR values were significantly higher in patients compared with controls and correlated with serum Angpt-2 levels. To transfer and further explore these findings in a cell culture system, we exposed endothelial cells (ECs) to serum (5%) from a subgroup of septic patients and nonseptic controls. Confocal and atomic force microscopy revealed that sepsis serum, but not control serum, induced thinning of the eGC on human ECs in vitro, which correlated with paired PBR values obtained in vivo ( = 0.96,  < 0.01). Inhibition of Angpt-2 or Tie2 activation completely abolished eGC damage. Mechanistically, sepsis-induced eGC breakdown required the loss of its main constituent heparan sulfate; a result of heparan sulfate-specific enzyme heparanase, which was suppressed by Tie2 activation. Finally, Tie2 activation, but not Angpt-2 inhibition, initiated after septic or enzymatic damage provoked rapid refurbishment of the eGC. Our data indicate that eGC breakdown in human sepsis is mediated via Tie2 deactivation by Angpt-2. Activation of Tie2 seems to accelerate recovery of the eGC and might hold promise as a therapeutic target in human sepsis.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30903201>Involvement of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors in lipid accumulation and depressed G6PD activity in the livers of rats treated with postpartum oral estrogen-progestin.</a></h2><p>Postpartum contraception is an important step for preventing closely spaced pregnancy. Combined oral contraceptive (COC) has been linked to cardiometabolic disturbances. We therefore hypothesized that postpartum oral estrogen-progestin use induces hepatic lipid accumulation that is associated with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation via adenosine deaminase (ADA)/xanthine oxidase (XO)/uric acid (UA)-dependent pathway. Female Wistar rats weighing 130-150 g were mated to achieve timed pregnancy and delivery. Twenty-four (24) dams were randomly assigned to receive vehicle (po), COC (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol and 5.0 μg levonorgestrel; po), COC with GR blockade (mifepristone; 80.0 mg/kg; po) and COC with MR blockade (spironolactone; 0.25 mg/kg; po) daily between 3rd and 11th week postpartum. Data showed that postpartum COC resulted in glucose dysregulation, increased visceral adiposity, liver weight, plasma corticosterone, aldosterone, circulating and hepatic free fatty acid (FFA), triglyceride (TG), adenosine deaminase (ADA), uric acid production, lactate production, and oxidative marker injury. On the other hand, G6PD-dependent antioxidant defenses were depressed by postpartum COC. However, these effects were attenuated by GR or MR blockade. Our data demonstrate that enhanced G6PD-dependent antioxidant defenses and suppressed ADA/XO/UA pathway in the liver by GR or MR blockade improves glucose dysregulation and hepatic TG accumulation induced by postpartum COC. This study implies a plausible involvement of GR and MR via defective G6PD-dependent antioxidant  and increased activity of ADA/XO/UA pathway in postpartum COC-induced hepatic lipid accumulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31370714>NOX4 inhibition protects enteric glial cells against  toxin  toxicity via attenuating oxidative and  stresses.</a></h2><p>Enteric glial cells (EGCs), one main cell population of the enteric nervous system (ENS), play a major role in regulating intestinal  .  toxin  (TcdB) is the major virulence factor produced by  and estimated to be toxic to EGCs by inducing cell death, cell cycle arrest, and inflammatory cytokine production; however, the detailed mechanism for such effect is still unclear. In this study, we further evaluated the toxic effect of TcdB on EGCs and the involvement of NADPH oxidases in such process using the rat-transformed EGCs (CRL-2690). The results showed that NOX4 was activated by TcdB in EGCs and functioned as the major factor causing cytotoxicity and cell apoptosis. Mechanically, NOX4-generated HO was the inducer of oxidative stress, Ca homeostasis disorder, and ER stress in EGCs upon TcdB treatment, and NOX4 inhibition protected EGCs against TcdB toxicity via attenuating these dysfunctions. These findings contribute to our understanding of the mechanism by which TcdB affects EGCs and suggest the potential value of NOX4 inhibition for treatment against  infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007068>Comparative in vitro transportation of pentamidine across the blood-brain  using polycaprolactone nanoparticles and phosphatidylcholine liposomes.</a></h2><p>Nanoparticles (NPs) have gained importance in addressing drug delivery challenges across biological barriers. Here, we reformulated pentamidine, a drug used to treat Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in polymer based nanoparticles and liposomes and compared their capability to enhance pentamidine penetration across blood brain  (BBB). Size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, morphology, pentamidine loading and drug release profiles were determined by various methods. Cytotoxicity was tested against the immortalized mouse brain endothelioma cells over 96 h. Moreover, cells monolayer integrity and transportation ability were examined for 24 h. Pentamidine-loaded polycaprolactone (PCL) nanoparticles had a mean size of 267.58, PDI of 0.25 and zeta potential of -28.1 mV and pentamidine-loaded liposomes had a mean size of 119.61 nm, PDI of 0.25 and zeta potential 11.78. Pentamidine loading was 0.16 µg/mg (w/w) and 0.17 µg/mg (w/w) in PCL NPs and liposomes respectively. PCL nanoparticles and liposomes released 12.13% and 22.21% of pentamidine respectively after 24 h. Liposomes transported 87% of the dose, PCL NPs 66% of the dose and free pentamidine penetration was 63% of the dose. These results suggest that liposomes are comparatively promising nanocarriers for transportation of pentamidine across BBB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31192265>The Postembryonic Development of the Immunological  in the Chicken Spleens.</a></h2><p>The avian immune system improves with the development of the lymphoid organs. The chickens' spleen serves as the largest peripheral lymphoid organ, but little immunological research has been conducted on that spleen during postembryonic development. We investigated the blood-spleen  (BSB) by developing morphological architecture, resistance to the corpuscular antigen, immunocyte distribution, gene expression levels of TLR2/4 and cytokines in the spleens of hatched chickens of differing ages. Results demonstrated that the resistance of exogenous carbon particles of the BSB improved with the morphological and structural development of the chicken spleens. The cuboidal endothelial cells which lined the sheathed capillaries were gradually visible, and the discontinuous basement membrane was thickened during postembryonic development. There was an increased number of T and  cells and antigen-presenting cells in the chicken spleen between hatching and adulthood. The mRNA expression levels of TLR2/4, IL-2, IFN-, and TNF- were higher two weeks after hatching, but these decreased and remain stable between 21 and 60 days. As the age increased, the BSB developed structurally and functionally.

Propensity score matching analysis was performed to improve comparability of the data from both entecavir group and the control group. Log-rank test was used to compare influence of various nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) for incidence of HCC. Independent risk factors were estimated by multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.The total cohort included 207 HBV-related cirrhotic patients, of which 83 patients were treated with entecavir initially. The present study found no statistical difference for the incidence of HCC between entecavir group and the control group in the total cohort (p=0.525). However, the difference became statistically significant (p=0.014) after propensity score matching.

On the other hand, neurons involved in pain processing ("nociceptors") can also provoke itching when the activation site is restricted to an isolated tiny spot within the epidermis. Individuals classified as having sensitive skin report increased itching and pain sensations upon weak external stimuli that are not painful or itchy in the control group. Numerous possible factors could contribute to sensitive skin along the pathway of transduction of the external stimuli into peripheral neuronal signals, followed by neuronal processing, finally resulting in the perception: (a) reduced local protective factors leading to impaired skin  , () increased production of excitatory skin mediators, (c) sensitized peripheral neurons, (d) facilitated spinal and central processing, and (e) reduced descending inhibition from the central nervous system. For all of those pathophysiological mechanisms there are clinical examples such as atopic dermatitis (a,,c), neuropathic itching (c,e), and restless leg syndrome (d,e). However, none of these factors have been directly linked to the occurrence of sensitive skin. Moreover, individuals reporting sensitive skin are heterogeneous and a subpopulation with defined pathophysiology has not yet been identified.

Scutellarin, an extract from Herba Erigerontis, is found to have oxygen-free radicals scavenging effects and antioxidant effects. In this study, we aimed to investigate the anti-AS effects of scutellarin is related to controlling the Hippo-FOXO3A and PI3K/AKT signal pathway. To establish an AS model, the rats in the scutellarin and model groups were intraperitoneally injected with vitamin D  and then fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks. In addition, in vitro angiotensin II-induced apoptosis of human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were used to establish models. Scutellarin significantly reduced blood lipid levels and increased antioxidase levels in both models. Additionally, scutellarin inhibited reactive oxygen species generation and apoptosis in HAECs. The impaired vascular   was restored by using scutellarin in AS rats and in HAECs cells characterized by inhibiting mammalian sterile-20-like kinases 1 (Mst1) phosphorylation, Yes-associated protein (YAP) phosphorylation, forkhead box O3A (FOXO3A) phosphorylation at serine 207, nuclear translocation of FOXO3A, and upregulating protein expression of AKT and FOXO3A phosphorylation at serine 253. Scutellarin significantly reduced Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death (Bim), caspase-3, APO-1, CD95 (Fas), and Bax: Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) levels and activated Bcl-2: -cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2). Scutellarin also significantly inhibited the expression of Mst1, YAP, FOXO3A at the messenger RNA level. When Mst1 was overexpressed or phosphoinositide 3-kinases suppressed, the effects of scutellarin were significantly blocked. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that scutellarin exerts protective effects against AS by inhibiting endothelial cell injury and apoptosis by regulating the Hippo-FOXO3A and PI3K/AKT signal pathways.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31067212>Erratum: Scalable Fabrication of Stretchable, Dual Channel, Microfluidic Organ Chips.</a></h2><p>An erratum was issued for: Scalable Fabrication of Stretchable, Dual Channel, Microfluidic Organ Chips.  The Representative Results, Discussion, and References sections have been updated.

This QA method allows for process troubleshooting, and we recommend keeping a record of process conditions to enable tracking fabrication problems that may occur during cell culture. During Organ Chip culture, inert tracer dyes are the simplest method of measuring   to troubleshoot the fabrication process and cell culture steps. Lucifer Yellow has been used historically due to its small molecular mass and innate fluorescence, but Cascade Blue offers similar properties with a narrower emission spectrum that is less likely to interfere with downstream assays.

The objective of this study was to establish whether endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) is present in human AT in obesity and to investigate the effect of such transition on endothelial  and the endothelial particulate secretome represented by extracellular vesicles (EV). Approach and Results: We identified EndoMT in obese human AT depots by immunohistochemical co-localization of CD31 or vWF and α-SMA (alpha-smooth muscle actin). We showed that AT EC exposed in vitro to TGF-β (tumor growth factor-β), TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α), and IFN-γ (interferon-γ) undergo EndoMT with progressive loss of endothelial markers. The phenotypic change results in failure to maintain a tight  in culture, increased migration, and reduced angiogenesis. EndoMT also reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and glycolytic capacity of EC. EVs produced by EC that underwent EndoMT dramatically reduced angiogenic capacity of the recipient naïve ECs without affecting their migration or proliferation. Proteomic analysis of EV produced by EC in the proinflammatory conditions showed presence of several pro-inflammatory and immune proteins along with an enrichment in angiogenic receptors.We demonstrated the presence of EndoMT in human AT in obesity. EndoMT in vitro resulted in production of EV that transferred some of the functional and metabolic features to recipient naïve EC. This result suggests that functional and molecular features of EC that underwent EndoMT in vivo can be disseminated in a paracrine or endocrine fashion and may induce endothelial dysfunction in distant vascular beds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161924>Occludin knockdown is not sufficient to induce transepithelial macromolecule passage.</a></h2><p>Occludin, a tight junction protein, has been reported to regulate   - particularly the leak pathway for larger solutes - in epithelia. Therefore, we aimed to precisely define its role in macromolecule passage at single cell-cell junctions. A combination of varying occludin expression by transient and stable knockdown including systematic seeding strategies was employed to achieve a broad and defined pattern of variance in occludin expression over epithelia. This variance model enabled us to examine occludin  in the leak pathway using global and local analysis, i.e. to analyze macromolecule flux across epithelia and macromolecule passage at single-cell level. Macromolecular flux was found not to correlate with occludin expression in intestinal epithelial cells. In fact, by spatially resolving macromolecular permeation sites using a recently developed method we uncovered leaky cell junctions at the edge of Transwells resulting in increased passage. This demonstrates that rare leaks can determine net flux of macromolecules across epithelia while the vast majority of cellular junctions do not contribute significantly. Hence, concomitant local analysis of macromolecule passage across epithelial barriers is indispensable for interpretation of global flux data. By combining this new approach with cell culture models of the leak pathway, we can present evidence that lack of occludin is not sufficient to stimulate the epithelial leak pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30936867> Coinfection Attenuates Murine -Induced Crohn's-Like Ileitis by Preserving the Epithelial  and Downregulating the Inflammatory Response.</a></h2><p> Mice orally infected with  develop Crohn's disease (CD)-like enteritis associated with severe mucosal damage and a systemic inflammatory response, resulting in high morbidity and mortality.

The IPEC-J2 cells were inoculated into 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 10 cells per well for 100% confluence. The cells were cultured in the presence of EB at concentrations of 0, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.20 mg/ml for 48 hr. Then, 0.10 mg/ml was selected as the suitable concentration for the estimation of transepithelial electric resistance (TEER) value, alkaline phosphatase activity, proinflammatory cytokines mRNA expression, tight junction mRNA and protein expression. The results of this study indicated that the supplementation of EB in IPEC-J2 cells decreased cellular membrane permeability and mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-γ (INF-γ), and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The supplementation of EB in IPEC-J2 cells increased tight junction protein expression and anti-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β).

This also affects knowledge concerning their geographic distribution. In Nigeria, using mitochondrial Cytochrome  gene sequences, we carried out a survey for shrews from the genus Crocidura across various ecological zones to determine taxa that are present and also to assess their phylogeographic structure. Our analyses include 183 specimens collected with Sherman traps from 19 localities around the country. We detected six taxa: Crocidura olivieri lineages II, III and IV, C. hildegardeae, C. jouvenetae, and C. foxi. Among these, C. hildegardeae and C. jouvenetae are reported in Nigeria for the first time. Phylogenetic comparison of our genetic sequences to those generated from other parts of Africa demonstrate that all species in our study, as currently defined, are in need of taxonomic revision. Geographically, Nigeria seems to represent the easternmost boundary for C. olivieri lineage II and C. jouvenetae, and the western distribution limit of C. olivieri lineage IV and C. hildegardeae.

However, some patients respond poorly to diuretic management. The PubMed database was searched to identify experimental studies on pulmonary edema in animals, experimental studies on surfactant , including patients with pulmonary edema, and clinical studies reporting  dysfunction and/or injury in patients with acute pulmonary edema. Studies with animal models demonstrate that high capillary pressures can cause  disruption in alveolar capillary units which increases permeability and the transfer of fluid and protein into lung parenchyma. Fluid in alveolar spaces alters surfactant  which increases fluid flux out of capillaries into the lung parenchyma secondary to larger transcapillary hydrostatic gradients. Patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema have increased levels of surfactant protein  in their plasma which reflect  disruption and increased levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha which reflect acute tissue injury. Increased surfactant protein  plasma levels are associated with abnormal gas exchange in patients with chronic heart failure. Patients with exercise-induced left ventricular dysfunction have increased levels of surfactant protein  after short periods of exercise. Pathology studies in patients with chronic heart failure have found increased connective tissue in alveolar capillary units and increased numbers of type II alveolar cells, and these changes represent an adaptive response in these patients. Clinicians need to consider the possibility of  dysfunction and disruption in patients with both acute and chronic pulmonary edema and understand that diuresis may have a limited effect on symptoms in some patients.2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

While clinical differences among them are well known, the underlying mechanisms are less explored. To gain an insight into the IBD pathogenesis and to find a specific biomarker pattern for each of them, we used protein array, ELISA and flow cytometry to analyze serum biomarkers and specific anti-microbial  and T cell responses to the gut commensals. We found that decrease in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and increase in MMP-14 are the strongest factors discriminating IBD patients from healthy subjects and that PSC-IBD patients have higher levels of Mannan-binding lectin, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1), CD14 and osteoprotegerin than patients with UC. Moreover, we found that low transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is associated with disease relapse and low osteoprotegerin with anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) therapy. Patients with CD have significantly decreased antibody and increased T cell response mainly to genera ,  and . These results stress the importance of the gut   and immune response to commensal bacteria and point at the specific differences in pathogenesis of PSC-IBD, UC and CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900870>Ultrasound Facilitates Naturally Equipped Exosomes Derived from Macrophages and Blood Serum for Orthotopic Glioma Treatment.</a></h2><p>Exosomes (Exos) are endogenous nanocarriers that have utility as novel delivery systems for the treatment of brain cancers. However, in general, natural Exos show limited BBB-crossing capacity and lack specific targeting. Further modifications including targeting peptides and genetic engineering approaches can circumvent these issues, but the process is time-consuming. Focused ultrasound (FUS) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases due to its noninvasive nature, reversibility, and instantaneous local opening of the BBB. In this study, we developed a natural and safe transportation system using FUS to increase the targeted delivery of Exos for glioma therapy. We also compared the advantages of macrophage-derived Exos (R-Exos) and blood serum-derived Exos (-Exos) to screen for an improved platform with scope for clinical transformation. In vitro, both R-Exos and -Exos were transported through BBB models and accumulated in glioma cells with the assistance of ultrasound exposure. R-Exos and -Exos displayed no obvious differences in physical characteristics, drug release, tumor targeting, and cytotoxicity when combined with FUS. In vivo animal imaging studies suggested that the fluorescence intensity of -Exos plus single FUS in brains was 4.45-fold higher than that of -Exos alone. Furthermore, -Exos plus twice FUS treatment efficiently suppressed glioma growth with no obvious side effects. We therefore demonstrate that the combination of FUS and naturally abundant -Exos is a potent strategy for brain cancer therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31335471>Protective effect of Saccharomyces boulardii on intestinal mucosal  of dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in mice.</a></h2><p>The effect and mechanism of Saccharomyces boulardii (Sb) in inflammatory bowel disease are unclear. The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of Sb on intestinal mucosal  and intestinal flora in a colitis mouse model.Forty C57BL/6J male mice were randomly assigned to five groups: normal control group (A), pathologic control group (), Sb treatment group (C), mesalazine treatment group (D), and Sb combined with mesalazine treatment group (E). Colitis was induced by the addition of 2.5% (wt/vol) dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in the drinking water ad libitum for 7 days. The general condition, weight change, stool property, and bloody stool level of mice were observed to evaluate the disease activity index. The expression of zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin in intestinal tissue were measured by immunohistochemistry. The level of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-8 in plasma was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Inter-cellular tight junctions were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The feces and intestinal contents were collected sterilely, and intestinal flora was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing.Compared with group , Sb reduced the disease activity index and histological score of group C (disease activity index: group  2.708 ± 0.628, group C 1.542 ± 0.616, PBC = 0.005; histological score: group  9.875 ± 3.271, group C 4.750 ± 1.832, PBC = 0.005) in DSS-induced colitis in mice.

Treatment with Sb preserved the tight junctions and ameliorated microvilli and inter-cellular space. Treatment with Sb also showed its own characteristics: a higher percentage of Bacteroidetes and a lower percentage of Firmicutes, with significant differences or a significant trend. The proportion of the S24-7 family was increased significantly in the Sb treatment group.Sb shows an anti-inflammatory effect and has a protective effect on the intestinal mucosal mechanical .

This randomized clinical trial enrolled 287 women in one South African site. The primary outcome of the study was the rate of female condom failure. Participants were asked to use five of each female condom type and to collect information on use in a condom log at home and were interviewed after use of each FC type.  Noninferiority was demonstrated for the WC2 with respect to the reference condom FC2 for all condom functions. The WC2 was found to be superior to the FC2 reference condom for clinical failure ( = .000), total female condom failure ( = .001), misdirection ( = .000) and slippage ( = .004).  The WC2 female condom performs as well as the FC2 female condom and offers good stability during use.

The missing consensus about CSF data interpretation prevents reliable conclusions. This can be overcome by a theory-based hyperbolic reference range in CSF/serum quotient diagrams.Mean Quotients for FLC-K, Q, and albumin, QAlb, of grouped, biochemically defined controls (N = 433) are fitted with the hyperbolic  Q(mean) = a/ (QAlb + ) - c by a generally applicable procedure excluding outliers.With Q(mean), the coefficient of variation CV (22.5%) and the reference range (Q(mean) ± 3 CV) we got the discrimination line Q(lim) = (3.27(QAlb + 33)-8.2) ×10 in a FLC-K Reibergram. Intrathecal FLC-K was found in 8% of another control group without OCB (N = 388) but was missed in 7% of patients with definite Multiple sclerosis (N = 95). In MS the mean intrathecal fraction was threefold larger for FLC-K (95%) compared to total IgG (36%). Similar mean quantities of intrathecal FLC-K contradict an immunological conversion between a Clinically isolated syndrome and MS.The hyperbolic reference range is superior to linear FLC-K Index (10 to 15% false negatives) and exponential curves (30% false positive interpretations for controls) in the analytical range of MS data, with excellent data fit for up to ten-fold larger QAlb values.

ZIKV can cross the placental  and infect foetal brains, resulting in microcephaly, but the pathogenesis of ZIKV is poorly understood. With recent findings reporting AXL as a type I interferon antagonist rather than an entry receptor, the exact entry mechanism remains unresolved. Here we report that cell surface sialic acid plays an important role in ZIKV infection. Removal of cell surface sialic acid by neuraminidase significantly abolished ZIKV infection in Vero cells and human induced-pluripotent stem cells-derived neural progenitor cells. Furthermore, knockout of the sialic acid biosynthesis gene encoding UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase resulted in significantly less ZIKV infection of both African and Asian lineages. Huh7 cells deficient in α2,3-linked sialic acid through knockout of ST3 β-galactoside-α2,3-sialyltransferase 4 had significantly reduced ZIKV infection. Removal of membrane-bound, un-internalized virus with pronase treatment revealed the role of sialic acid in ZIKV internalization but not attachment. Sialyllactose inhibition studies showed that there is no direct interaction between sialic acid and ZIKV, implying that sialic acid could be mediating ZIKV-receptor complex internalization. Identification of α2,3-linked sialic acid as an important host factor for ZIKV internalization provides new insight into ZIKV infection and pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560549>The Permeation of Acamprosate Is Predominantly Caused by Paracellular Diffusion across Caco-2 Cell Monolayers: A Paracellular Modeling Approach.</a></h2><p>In drug development, estimating fraction absorbed () in man for permeability-limited compounds is important but challenging. To model  of such compounds from apparent permeabilities () across filter-grown Caco-2 cell monolayers, it is central to elucidate the intestinal permeation mechanism(s) of the compound. The present study aims to refine a computational permeability model to investigate the relative contribution of paracellular and transcellular routes to the  across Caco-2 monolayers of the permeability-limited compound acamprosate having a bioavailability of ∼11%. The  values of acamprosate and of several paracellular marker molecules were measured. These  values were used to refine system-specific parameters of the Caco-2 monolayers, that is, paracellular pore radius, pore capacity, and potential drop. The refined parameters were subsequently used as an input in modeling the permeability () of the tested compounds using mathematical models collected from two published permeability models. The experimental data show that acamprosate  across Caco-2 monolayers is low and similar in both transport directions. The obtained acamprosate , 1.56 ± 0.28 × 10 cm·s, is similar to the  of molecular markers for paracellular permeability, namely, mannitol (2.72 ± 0.24 × 10 cm·s), lucifer yellow (1.80 ± 0.35 × 10 cm·s), and fluorescein (2.10 ± 0.28 × 10 cm·s), and lower than that of atenolol (7.32 ± 0.60 × 10 cm·s; mean ± SEM,  = 3-6), while the end-point amount of acamprosate internalized by the cell monolayer, , was lower than that of mannitol. Acamprosate did not influence the   of the monolayers since it altered neither the  of the three paracellular markers nor the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of the cell monolayer. The  for all the paracellular markers and acamprosate was dominated by the  component and matched the experimentally obtained . Furthermore, acamprosate did not inhibit the uptake of probe substrates for solute carriers PEPT1, TAUT, PAT1, EAAT1, AT/rBAT, OATP2B1, and ASBT expressed in Caco-2 cells. Thus, the  estimated well , and the paracellular route appears to be the predominant mechanism for acamprosate  across Caco-2 monolayers, while the alternative transcellular routes, mediated by passive diffusion or carriers, are suggested to only play insignificant roles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169980>Improving skin integration around long-term percutaneous devices using fibrous scaffolds in a reconstructed human skin equivalent model.</a></h2><p>The interface between synthetic percutaneous devices and skin is a common area for bacterial infection, which may ultimately result in failure of the device. Better integration of percutaneous devices with skin may help reduce infection rates due to the creation of a dermal seal. However, the mismatch in material and chemical properties of devices and skin presents a challenge for closing the dermal gap at the skin-device interface. Here, we have used a tissue engineering approach to tissue integration by creating a highly fibrous poly(ε-caprolactone) scaffold using melt electrowriting and seeding this with dermal fibroblasts, followed by maturation and insertion into a full-thickness defect made in an ex vivo skin model. The integration of seeded scaffolds was compared with controls including a non-seeded scaffold and a polymer tube with a smooth surface. Dermal fibroblast inclusion in the scaffold and epidermal upgrowth versus downgrowth/marsupialization around the device were used as measures of integration. Based on these measures, almost all pre-seeded scaffolds performed better than both the non-seeded scaffolds and smooth tubes. The hypothesis is that the fibroblasts act as a  to epithelial downward migration, and provide healthy tissue for nascent epidermal development.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591200>A small-molecule inhibitor of BamA impervious to efflux and the outer membrane permeability .</a></h2><p>The development of new antimicrobial drugs is a priority to combat the increasing spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria. This development is especially problematic in gram-negative bacteria due to the outer membrane (OM) permeability  and multidrug efflux pumps. Therefore, we screened for compounds that target essential, nonredundant, surface-exposed processes in gram-negative bacteria. We identified a compound, MRL-494, that inhibits assembly of OM proteins (OMPs) by the β-barrel assembly machine (BAM complex). The BAM complex contains one essential surface-exposed protein, BamA. We constructed a  mutagenesis library, screened for resistance to MRL-494, and identified the mutation   BamA restores OMP biogenesis in the presence of MRL-494. The mutant protein has both altered conformation and activity, suggesting it could either inhibit MRL-494 binding or allow BamA to  in the presence of MRL-494. By cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), we determined that MRL-494 stabilizes BamA and BamA from thermally induced aggregation, indicating direct or proximal binding to both BamA and BamA Thus, it is the altered activity of BamA responsible for resistance to MRL-494. Strikingly, MRL-494 possesses a second mechanism of action that kills gram-positive organisms. In microbes lacking an OM, MRL-494 lethally disrupts the cytoplasmic membrane. We suggest that the compound cannot disrupt the cytoplasmic membrane of gram-negative bacteria because it cannot penetrate the OM. Instead, MRL-494 inhibits OMP biogenesis from outside the OM by targeting BamA. The identification of a small molecule that inhibits OMP biogenesis at the cell surface represents a distinct class of antibacterial agents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31288522>Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Deposition of Hydrophilic/Phobic Patterns and Thin Film Laminates on Any Surface.</a></h2><p>Patterned and layered hydrophilic/phobic coatings were deposited on multiple surfaces using nonfluorinated precursors (AA, acrylic acid; PMA, propargyl methacrylate) with an atmospheric pressure dielectric  discharge operating in open air. Water contact angles of the resulting films could be tuned from <5° (superhydrophilic) to >135° (very hydrophobic) by adjusting the AA/PMA feed ratio and/or via postdeposition exposure of films to an Ar/O plasma treatment. Coatings could be applied to any surface and were seen to be water stable, due in large part to cross-linking induced from the reactivity of the PMA pendant groups. Hybrid hydrophilic/phobic patterns at submillimeter length scales, and philic/phobic/philic laminates were produced using a shadow mask and sequential deposition, respectively. Chemical heterogeneity of films was assessed using XPS, SIMS, and micro-IR imaging and suggest that localization of COOH and OH groups are primarily responsible for hydrophilicity.

However, acute or chronic exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) has several harmful effects on the skin structure and , especially in the case of the failing  of antioxidative enzymes, which may lead to substantial tissue damage due to the increased presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The aim of this work was to investigate the combined effect of ultraviolet  (UVB) irradiation and oxidative stress on the skin  integrity. For this, we employed electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to characterize changes of the electrical properties of excised pig skin membranes after various exposure conditions of UVB irradiation, oxidative stress, and the inhibition of antioxidative enzymatic processes. The oxidative stress was regulated by adding hydrogen peroxide (HO) as a source of ROS, while sodium azide (NaN) was used as an inhibitor of the antioxidative enzyme catalase, which is naturally present throughout the epidermis. By screening for the combined effect of UVB and oxidative stress on the skin membrane electrical properties, we developed a new protocol for evaluating these parameters in a simple in vitro setup. Strikingly, the results show that exposure to extreme UVB irradiation does not affect the skin membrane resistance, implying that the skin  remains macroscopically intact. Likewise, exposure to only oxidative stress conditions, without UVB irradiation, does not affect the skin membrane resistance. In contrast to these observations, the combination of UVB irradiation and oxidative stress conditions results in a drastic decrease of the skin membrane resistance, indicating that the integrity of the skin  is compromised. Further, the skin membrane effective capacitance remained more or less unaffected by UVB exposure, irrespective of simultaneous exposure of oxidative stress. The EIS results were concluded to be associated with clear signs of macroscopic tissue damage of the epidermis as visualized with microscopy after exposure to UVB irradiation under oxidative stress conditions. Finally, the novel methodology was tested by performing an assessment of cosmetic sunscreen formulations with varying sun protection factor (SPF), with an overall successful outcome, showing good correlation between SPF value and protection capacity in terms of skin resistance change. The results from this study allow for the development of new skin sensors based on EIS for the detection of skin tissue damage from exposure to UVB irradiation and oxidative stress and provide a new, more comprehensive methodology, taking into account both the influence of UVB irradiation and oxidative stress, for in vitro determination of SPF in cosmetic formulations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626364>Neurochemical regulation of the expression and  of glial fibrillary acidic protein in astrocytes.</a></h2><p>Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a type III intermediate filament, is a marker of mature astrocytes. The expression of GFAP gene is regulated by many transcription factors (TFs), mainly Janus kinase-2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 cascade and nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cell signaling. GFAP expression is also modulated by protein kinase and other signaling molecules that are elicited by neuronal activity and hormones. Abnormal expression of GFAP proteins occurs in neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, brain edema-eliciting diseases, traumatic brain injury, psychiatric disorders and others. GFAP, mainly in α-isoform, is the major component of cytoskeleton and the scaffold of astrocytes, which is essential for the maintenance of astrocytic structure and shape. GFAP also has highly morphological plasticity because of its quick changes in assembling and polymerizing states in response to environmental challenges. This plasticity and its corresponding cellular morphological changes endow astrocytes the functions of physical  between adjacent neurons and stabilizer of extracellular environment. Moreover, GFAP colocalizes and even molecularly associates with many functional molecules. This feature allows GFAP to  as a platform for direct interactions between different molecules. Last, GFAP involves transportation and localization of other functional proteins and thus serves as a protein transport guide in astrocytes. This guiding role of GFAP involves an elastic retraction and extension cytoskeletal network that couples with GFAP reassembling, transporting, and membrane protein recycling machinery.

The components in exosomes, such as DNA, RNA, protein, and lipids, change greatly and are closely related to disease progression. Circular RNA (circRNA) is stable in structure and has a long half-life in exosomes without degradation. Therefore, circRNA is considered an ideal biomarker and can be used to monitor a variety of central nervous system diseases. This study aimed to investigate the expression profiles of exosomal circRNA (exo-circRNA) in CSF from patients with immune-mediated demyelinating diseases to identify suitable biomarkers for the early diagnosis of immune-mediated demyelinating diseases. circRNA expression levels in exosomes obtained from five CSF samples from immune-mediated demyelinating disease patients and five paired CSF control samples were analyzed using a hybridization array. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that 5,095 exo-circRNAs were differentially expressed between patients with immune-mediated demyelinating diseases and paired control samples. Of these exo-circRNAs, 26 were identified as significantly differentially expressed in CSF exosomes from patients with immune-mediated demyelinating diseases (FC ≥1.5 and p ≤ 0.05). Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis indicated that the upregulation or activation of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type F (PTPRF) and RAD23 homolog , nucleotide excision repair protein (RAD23B) may be associated with the occurrence and development of immune-mediated demyelinating diseases. Then, a competing endogenous RNA network was constructed and centered on the most upregulated/downregulated exo-circRNAs to predict their  in immune-mediated demyelinating diseases. In addition, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction results stating that hsa_circ_0087862 and hsa_circ_0012077 were validated in an independent cohort of subjects. Canonical correlation analysis results indicated a potential connection between exosomal hsa_circ_0012077 expression level and immunoglobulin G levels in CSF. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that when hsa_circ_0087862 or hsa_circ_0012077 was employed alone for diagnosing immune-mediated demyelinating diseases, the diagnostic accuracy was 100%. In conclusion, based on this study, exosomal hsa_circ_0087862 and hsa_circ_0012077 in CSF could be used as suitable biomarkers for the diagnosis of immune-mediated demyelinating disease based on their expression levels.

High-performance liquid chromatography chromatograms illustrate successful fractionation of the blueberry powder into TPF, AEF, and PEF. AEF contained 21 anthocyanins, and PEF contained proanthocyanidin oligomers of (epi)catechin with primarily -type interflavan bonds.

We hypothesized that Plt-EVs would inhibit vascular EC permeability, similar to fresh Plts. To investigate this hypothesis, we used in vitro and in vivo models of vascular endothelial compromise and bleeding.In the vitro model, Plt-EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation and characterized for Plt markers and particle size distribution. Effects of Plts and Plt-EVs on endothelial   were assessed by transendothelial electrical resistance measurements and histological analysis of endothelial junction proteins. Hemostatic potential of Plt-EVs and Plts was assessed by multiple electrode Plt aggregometry. Using an in vivo model, the effects of Plts and Plt-EVs on vascular permeability and bleeding were assessed in non-obese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) mice by an established Miles assay of vascular permeability and a tail snip bleeding assay.In the in vitro model, Plt-EVs displayed exosomal size distribution and expressed Plt-specific surface markers. Platelets and Plt-EVs decreased EC permeability and restored EC junctions after thrombin challenge. Multiplate aggregometry revealed that Plt-EVs enhanced thrombin receptor-activating peptide-mediated aggregation of whole blood, whereas Plts enhanced thrombin receptor-activating peptide-, arachidonic acid-, collagen-, and adenosine diphosphate-mediated aggregation. In the in vivo model, Plt-EVs are equivalent to Plts in attenuating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A-induced vascular permeability and uncontrolled blood loss in a tail snip hemorrhage model.Our study is the first to report that Plt-EVs might provide a feasible product for transfusion in trauma patients to attenuate bleeding, inhibit vascular permeability, and mitigate the endotheliopathy of trauma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31379246>Opioid use potentiates the virulence of hospital-acquired infection, increases systemic bacterial dissemination and exacerbates gut dysbiosis in a murine model of  infection.</a></h2><p>Opioid analgesics are frequently prescribed in the United States and worldwide. However, serious side effects such as addiction, immunosuppression and gastrointestinal symptoms limit their use. It was recently demonstrated that morphine treatment results in a significant disruption in gut  , leading to an increased translocation of gut commensal bacteria.

The impact of dynamics on protein  is typically reported over a fraction of the full scope of motional timescales. If motional patterns vary significantly at different timescales, then only by monitoring motions broadly will we understand the impact of protein dynamics on engineering functional proteins. Using an integrative approach combining experimental and in silico methodologies, we elucidate protein dynamics over the entire span of fast to slow timescales (ps to ms) for a laboratory-engineered system composed of five interrelated β-lactamases: two natural homologs and three laboratory-recombined variants. Fast (ps-ns) and intermediate (ns-µs) dynamics were mostly conserved. However, slow motions (µs-ms) were few and conserved in the natural homologs yet were numerous and widely dispersed in their recombinants. Nonetheless, modified slow dynamics were functionally tolerated. Crystallographic -factors from high-resolution X-ray structures were partly predictive of the conserved motions but not of the new slow motions captured in our solution studies. Our inspection of protein dynamics over a continuous range of timescales vividly illustrates the complexity of dynamic impacts of protein engineering as well as the functional tolerance of an engineered enzyme system to new slow motions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029423>Aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation alleviates dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis through enhancing the differentiation of goblet cells.</a></h2><p>The intestinal inflammation induces disruption of the intestinal   and leads to bacteria invasion. Accumulating evidences revealed that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) plays a vital role in maintaining the intestinal  . However, the precise mechanism remains to be unclear.Adult C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into three groups: Sham, DSS and DSS + 6-formylindolo (3, 2-) carbazole (FICZ)group. The colons and epithelial cell were harvested for histological examination, pro-inflammatory cytokines detection, bacterial load analysis, immunohistochemistry and Muc2 protein analysis. Under physiological condition, AhRKO model and FICZ treatment were used to evaluate the roles of AhR in the differentiation of goblet cells and the expression of Muc2 in mice. In vitro, we used HT29 mol to research the signaling pathway.AhR activation by FICZ could increase the Muc2 expression and the number of goblet cells and reduce bacterial infiltration to ameliorate DSS-induced Colitis. Under physiological conditions, the treatment of FICZ promote the differentiation of goblet cell and the expression of Muc2 and inhibit the notch-signaling. Genetic deletion of AhR led to the loss of goblet cells and the decrease of Muc2 expression and enhance the notch-signaling. In HT29 cells, the differentiation of goblet cell meditated by AhR can be abolished by the inhibitor of AhR, pErk1/2 and knocking-down AhR.FICZ promoted the differentiation of goblet cell through AhR-pErk1/2 signaling pathway and ameliorate DSS-induced Colitis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Since it crosses placental  it can induce warfarin embryopathy (WE), a fetal mortality in neonates characterized by skeletal deformities in addition to brain hemorrhages. Although the effects of warfarin exposure in aquatic off target species were already described, the particular molecular toxicological mechanisms during early development are still unclear. Here, we used zebrafish (Danio rerio) to describe and compare the developmental effects of warfarin exposure (0, 15.13, 75.68 and 378.43 mM) on two distinct early developmental phases (embryos and eleuthero-embryos). Although exposure to both developmental phases induced fish mortality, only embryos exposed to the highest warfarin level exhibited features mimicking mammalian WE, e.g. high mortality, higher incidence of hemorrhages and altered skeletal development, among other effects. To gain insights into the toxic mechanisms underlying warfarin exposure, the transcriptome of embryos exposed to warfarin was explored through RNA-Seq and compared to that of control embryos. 766 differentially expressed (564 up- and 202 down-regulated) genes were identified. Gene Ontology analysis revealed particular cellular components (cytoplasm, extracellular matrix, lysosome and vacuole), biological processes (mainly amino acid and lipid metabolism and response to stimulus) and pathways (oxidative stress response and apoptosis signaling pathways) being significantly overrepresented in zebrafish embryos upon warfarin exposure. Protein-protein interaction further evidenced an altered redox system, blood coagulation and vasculogenesis, visual phototransduction and collagen formation upon warfarin exposure. The present study not only describes for the first time the WE in zebrafish, it provides new insights for a better risk assessment, and highlights the need for programming the rat eradication actions outside the fish spawning season to avoid an impact on off target fish community. The urge for the development of more species-specific anticoagulants for rodent pest control is also highlighted.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and residual protein on D-Squame discs were assessed over 14 days.Twenty-four subjects were included. For method A, the mean slope values of plots of 1/TEWL vs cumulative protein removed decreased over time for both treated and untreated areas, indicating improved SC  quality. There were no significant differences between treated and untreated areas, although a trend to a more negative slope was observed by Day 14 in the treated areas (P = 0.082), suggesting treatment improved  quality. For method , using pre- and post-stripping as covariates, no statistical differences/trends were observed between treated and untreated areas for change in TEWL from post-stripping to any evaluation from Days 3-14. TEWL values returned towards pre-stripping values for treated and untreated areas by the initial Day 3 evaluation.For method A, there were trends suggesting the moisturizing treatment improved SC  quality. For method , there were no significant differences/trends between treated and untreated areas.

Systemic chronic low-grade inflammation has been reported to be associated with MDD progression by affecting monoaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission. However, whether various proinflammatory cytokines are abnormally elevated before the first episode of depression is still largely unclear. Here, we evaluated 184 adolescent patients who were experiencing their first episode of depressive disorder, and the same number of healthy individuals was included as controls. We tested the serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IgE, 14 different types of food antigen-specific IgG, histamine, homocysteine, S100 calcium-binding protein , and diamine oxidase. We were not able to find any significant differences in the serum levels of hs-CRP or TNF-α between the two groups. However, the histamine level of the patients (12.35 μM) was significantly higher than that of the controls (9.73 μM, P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). Moreover, significantly higher serum food antigen-specific IgG positive rates were also found in the patient group. Furthermore, over 80% of patients exhibited prolonged food intolerance with elevated levels of serum histamine, leading to hyperpermeability of the blood-brain , which has previously been implicated in the pathogenesis of MDD. Hence, prolonged high levels of serum histamine could be a risk factor for depressive disorders, and antihistamine release might represent a novel therapeutic strategy for depression treatment.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

This study aimed to investigate if rutin hydrate (RH), a well-reported neuroprotective and an antioxidant flavonoid, can ameliorate cadmium chloride (CdCl2)-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting the resultant ER stress. Rats were divided into 4 groups (n = 16/group) of control, control + RH (100 mg/kg), CdCl (5 mg/kg), and CdCl + RH. All treatments were administered orally for 30 days, on daily basis. Brain homogenates from CdCl-treated rats showed increased oxidative stress and induced activation of ER stress characterized by increasing mRNA and protein levels of GRP78, ATF-6, CHOP and Xbp-1 and protein levels of p-elF2α, p-JNK1/2 and cleaved caspase-12. Also, CdCl significantly reduced Bcl-2, enhanced Bax translocation to the mitochondrial membrane, increased cytoplasmic levels of cytochrome-C and caspase-3, and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) (increased Vmax and reduced time to Vmax). In contrast, RH significantly enhanced levels GSH and activities of SOD, GSH-Px, decreased levels of MDA and inhibited mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mtPTP) in the brains of both control and CdCl-treated rats. Interestingly, in brain homogenates of CdCl-treated rats only, RH reduced all markers of ER stress, increased Bcl-2, reduced mitochondrial Bax translocation and improved mitochondrial coupling. It also reduced cytosolic levels of cytochrome-C, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-12. Overall, these findings support the efficiency of RH to inhibit ER stress in brains CdCl2-treated rats which is added to its existing mechanisms of neuroprotection. : ATF-6: activating transcription factor-6; Bax: Bcl-associated x; BBB: blood-brain ; Bcl-2: -cell lymphoma 2; BiP: immunoglobulin heavy-chain-binding protein; [Ca]i: intracellular free Ca concentration; Cd: cadmium; CdCl: cadmium chloride; CHOP: CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein; CMC: carboxymethyl cellulose; Δψm: mitochondrial membrane potential; elF2α: phospho-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD: ER-associated protein degradation; ERK1/2: extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2; GADD 153: growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 153; GRP78, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein; GSH: reduced glutathione; GSH: reduced glutathione; GSH-Px: glutathione peroxidase; GSSG: glutathione disulfide (oxidized glutathione); IRE-1: inositol-requiring enzyme-1; JNK: c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; MDA: malondialdehyde; mTOR: Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin; mtPTP: mitochondrial permeability transition pore; ONOO: peroxynitrite; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; PERK: protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase; p-JNK: phospho-JNK; qPCR: quantitative PCR; RCR: respiratory control ratio; RH: rutin hydrate; RHoGDI: Rho-GDP-dissociation inhibitor; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SOD: superoxide dismutase; UPR: unfolded protein response; VDAC: voltage-dependent anion channel; Vmax: maximal rate of pore opening; Xbp-1: X-box binding protein 1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31204906>Models for skin and brain penetration of major components from essential oils used in aromatherapy for dementia patients.</a></h2><p>Aromatherapy with essential oils (EOs) has been linked to improvement of cognitive  in patients with dementia. In order to act systemically, active EO components must be absorbed through the skin, enter the systemic circulation, and cross the blood brain  (BBB). Thus, the aim of this work was to develop quantitative structure activity relationships (QSARs), to predict skin and blood  penetrative abilities of 119 terpenoids from EOs used in aromatherapy. The first model was based on experimentally measured skin permeability for 162 molecules, and the second model on BBB permeability for 138 molecules. Each molecule was encoded with 63 calculated molecular descriptors and an artificial neural network was used to correlate molecular descriptors to permeabilities. Developed QSAR models confirm that EOs components penetrate through the skin and across the BBB. Some well-known descriptors, such as log P (lipophilicity), molecular size and shape, dominated the QSAR model for BBB permeability. Compounds with the highest predicted BBB penetration were hydrocarbon terpenes with the smallest molecular size and highest lipophilicity. Thus, molecular size is a limiting factor for penetration. Compounds with the highest skin permeability have slightly higher molecular size, high lipophilicity and low polarity. Our work shows that a major disadvantage of novel multitarget compounds developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease is the size of molecules, which cause problems in their delivery to the brain. Therefore, there is a need for smaller compounds, which possess more desirable physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetics, in addition to targeted biological effects.

Most researchers confirm the relationship between the severity of immunobiochemical changes and clinical outcome of acute ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke is accompanied by aseptic inflammation, which alters the brain tissue and exposes the co-stimulatory molecules of the immune system and the neuronal antigens. To date, BBB is not considered the border between the immune system and central nervous system, and the local immune subsystems are found within and behind the BBB. BBB disruption contributes to the leakage of brain autoantigens and induction of secondary autoimmune response to neuronal antigens and long-term inflammation. Glymphatic system  is altered and jeopardized both in hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke types. The receptors of innate immunity (toll-like receptor-2 and toll-like receptor-4) are also involved in acute ischemia-reperfusion injury. Immune response is related to the key processes of blood clotting and fibrinolysis. At the same time, the stroke-induced immune activation may promote reparation phenomena in the brain. Subsequent research on the reduction of the acute ischemic brain injury through the target regulation of the immune response is promising.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31054408>Bcells and their regulatory functions during Tuberculosis: Latency and active disease.</a></h2><p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a global epidemic with devastating consequences.

The homotrimeric inner membrane component acriflavine resistance  (AcrB) is the drug specificity and energy transduction center for the drug/proton antiport process. Drugs are bound and expelled via a cycle of mainly three consecutive states in every protomer, constituting a flexible alternating access channel system. This review recapitulates the molecular basis of drug and inhibitor binding, including mechanistic insights into drug efflux by AcrB. It also summarizes 17 years of mutational analysis of the gene acrB, reporting the effect of every substitution on the ability of E. coli to confer resistance toward antibiotics (http://goethe.link/AcrBsubstitutions). We emphasize the functional robustness of AcrB toward single-site substitutions and highlight regions that are more sensitive to perturbation.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, the aim was to investigate the effects of , a gut microbiota, on OSM and on intestinal  in colitis.  In the murine model of 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, we tested disease activity index (DAI), colon length, histological score and expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins (ZO-1, occludin and claudin-1), OSM, TNF-α and TLR5. In addition, a cellular model was used to examine the role of  during secretion of OSM by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) isolated from wild-type (WT) and TLR5 knockout (TLR5 KO) mice. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of OSM on expressions of TJ proteins by Caco-2 cells.   in DSS-induced colitis decreased DAI score ( < .001), colon length shortening (6.46 ± 0.36 cm  5.65 ± 0.47 cm,  = .022), histological score (2.667 ± 1.15  5.33 ± 1.14,  = .018) and increased expression of TJ proteins ( < .05). In addition,  reduced expression of OSM ( < .05) and TNF-α ( < .05), while increasing expression of TLR5 ( < .05). Furthermore,  reduced secretion of OSM ( < .05) by LPS-induced BMDMs isolated from WT and TLR5 KO mice. Moreover, OSM downregulated expression of TJ proteins ( < .05) by Caco-2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner.  These results indicate that  attenuates inflammation in IBD by decreasing secretion of OSM and by promoting intestinal  . Taken together, the data provide insight into the role of the gut microbiota in patients with IBD who are resistant to anti-TNF therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30929229>Antimicrobial effect and proposed action mechanism of cordycepin against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.</a></h2><p>The detailed antibacterial mechanism of cordycepin efficacy against food-borne germs remains ambiguous. In this study, the antibacterial activity and action mechanism of cordycepin were assessed. The results showed that cordycepin effectively inhibited the growth of seven bacterial pathogens including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens; the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were 2.5 and 1.25 mg/ml against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, respectively. Scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope examination confirmed that cordycepin caused obvious damages in the cytoplasmatic membranes of both E. coli and . subtilis. Outer membrane permeability assessment indicated the loss of   and the leakage of cytoplasmic contents. Propidium iodide and carboxyfluorescein diacetate double staining approach coupled with flow cytometry analysis indicated that the integrity of cell membrane was severely damaged during a short time, while the intracellular enzyme system still remained active. This clearly suggested that membrane damage was one of the reasons for cordycepin efficacy against bacteria. Additionally, results from circular dichroism and fluorescence analysis indicated cordycepin could insert to genome DNA base and double strand, which disordered the structure of genomic DNA. Basis on these results, the mode of bactericidal action of cordycepin against E. coli and . subtilis was found to be a dual mechanism, disrupting bacterial cell membranes and binding to bacterial genomic DNA to interfere in cellular functions, ultimately leading to cell death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572002>Impact of antiviral therapy with nucleos(t)ide analog on survival of patients with HBV-related small hepatocellular carcinomas.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading causes of cancer-related death. HCC is usually based on chronic liver disease, mainly including chronic hepatitis C virus infection or chronic hepatitis  virus (HBV) infection.The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of the nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) use on the prognosis of patients with HBV-related small hepatocellular carcinomas (HBV-SHCC).In this retrospective study, there were 134 patients who had been treated with long-term NA before SHCC diagnosis as NA-experienced group, 43 patients received NA-naïve treatment after SHCC diagnosis as NA-naïve group, and 15 patients who did not receive NA treatment as untreated group. Among these patients, some patients underwent surgical resection and others with local recurrence were treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), TACE-percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy or TACE alone. The Kaplan-Meier and Cox-proportional hazard model were used to calculate the survival analysis.The data showed that 1-year, 3-year, 5-year overall survival rate of HBV-SHCC patients in NA-experienced group were 90.27%, 90.69%, 65%, NA-naïve group were 70.81%, 73.95%, 47.39%, and untreated group were 54.96%, 40.44%, 47.39%, respectively (Log-rank, =0.031). The median survival time of HBV-SHCC patients treated with adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) or LAM+ADV has the longest survival time. Patients who have received rescue treatment after viral breakthrough or gotten maintained viral response had longer survival times than those who have not received rescue treatment after viral breakthrough or non-response. Compared with timely rescue treatment, viral breakthrough (hazard ratio=3.624, 95% CI, 1.035-12.687, =0.044) was an independent risk factor for HBV-SHCC patients with Cox-proportional hazard model. For these patients conforming to NA-treatment indications, commencement of NA treatment should be given even after HBV-SHCC diagnosis. Moreover, HBV-SHCC patients who were suffering from virus break through should be treated timely rescue therapy even if their liver  was normal.SHCC patients treated with low drug resistance  drugs may not change the treatment regimen if they have gotten virological response.© 2019 Wei et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31033295>Optimization of Patterned Surfaces for Improved Superhydrophobicity through Cost-Effective Large-Scale Computations.</a></h2><p>The pattern design of superhydrophobic surfaces can be significantly aided by computations that predict the Cassie-Baxter (CB) to Wenzel (W) transition, which is responsible for the break-down of superhydrophobic behavior. We present a computational framework for the optimization of patterned surfaces based on the energy barriers of the CB-W transitions which comprises the following elements: (a) design of structured surface patterns, for example, arrays of pillars, with parameterized geometric features such as size, pitch, slope, and roundness. () Computation of the wetting states with a modified Young-Laplace equation that facilitates the introduction of solid/liquid interactions for complex surface patterns and has significantly lower computational cost than other commonly used methods, such as the volume-of-fluid, phase-field, and so forth. (c) Incorporation of the modified Young-Laplace in the simplified string method, allowing the calculation of the minimum energy paths of wetting transitions which, apart from the energy barriers, also reveal the transition mechanisms (CB failure modes). (d) Accommodation of large-scale problems with good parallel performance and scalability on multicore-distributed memory systems using fast iterative solvers and the Message Passing Interface communication protocol. We demonstrate the computational framework with a shape optimization study of inverted conical frustum pillars. The optimization objective  is the resistance to the CB-W transition, which is quantified by the energy -a relatively large energy  suggests improved superhydrophobicity.

The physical properties of the AR formulations were analysed using measurement of water vapour transport rate (WVTR) and infrared spectroscopy. Clinical studies were performed between the months of December and April (2014-15) with efficacy assessed during the winter. Facial redness, irritation, sensitization potential, photo-irritation, and photo-sensitization were evaluated. Self-assessed adverse reactions were reported in diaries of use.Panthenol and PEA reduced prostaglandin E , interleukin-6, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin levels in vitro, while NAM induced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) levels and the keratinocyte differentiation markers: filaggrin (2-fold increase, p < 0.001), loricrin (2-fold increase, p <0.05), involucrin (2 fold increase, p < 0.001) & peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor-alpha (1.5 fold increase, p < 0.05). The two AR products exhibited low WVTR (include changes and stats) and displayed an ordered lipid structure. The day cream formulation protected against ultraviolet  radiation in vitro. A total of 382 participants were included in clinical studies which showed the AR formulations significantly improved facial redness associated with winter xerosis (include improvements and stats). No irritation, sensitization, photo-irritation, photo-sensitization or product-related adverse reactions were observed or reported in the clinical studies.The new products significantly improved skin redness associated with winter xerosis in participants with self-perceived sensitive skin.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounts for more than 90% of diabetic patients, mainly caused by environmental factors. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) exhibit several health benefits to the host including regulating glucose and lipid metabolism and improving oxidative stress and inflammatory response. However, the anti-diabetic mechanism of probiotics has not been elucidated clearly. In this study, the anti-diabetic effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus KLDS1.1003 and KLDS1.0901 on T2D mice were assessed. Oral administration of L. acidophilus KLDS1.1003 and KLDS1.0901 for 6 weeks significantly improved the epithelial  , which in turn lowered inflammation cytokines, including IL-8, TNF-α and IL-1β in liver and colon tissue, and prevented liver and colon tissue injuries to some extent. Additionally, L. acidophilus treatment regulated the expression genes that are related to glucose and lipid metabolism. The two tested strains down-regulated the expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), fatty acid synthase (FAS) and sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1c (SREBP-1c), and up-regulated the expression of protein kinase  (Akt). However, L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 is better for improving T2D than L. acidophilus KLDS1.1003. Further research showed that L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 supplementation could reshape gut microbiota, increasing short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria (Blautia, Roseburia and Anaerotruncus) and the level of SCFAs and decreasing the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria such as Desulfovibrio, Alistipes and Bacteroides. Notably, L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 treatment restored the structure of gut microbiota similar to the control group. These findings suggested that L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 might be used as a new type of antidiabetic drug candidate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966773>Aloin Reduces HMGB1-Mediated Septic Responses and Improves Survival in Septic Mice by Activation of the SIRT1 and PI3K/Nrf2/HO-1 Signaling Axis.</a></h2><p>High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is recognized as a late mediator of sepsis, and the inhibition of HMGB1 release and recovery of vascular  integrity have emerged as attractive therapeutic strategies for the management of sepsis. We tested the hypothesis that aloin induces sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and heme oxygenase (HO)-1, which inhibit HMGB1 release in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated cells, thereby inhibiting HMGB1-induced hyperpermeability and increasing the survival of septic mice. Aloin was administered after LPS or HMGB1 challenge, and the antiseptic activity of aloin was determined from measurements of permeability, activation of pro-inflammatory proteins and production of markers for tissue injury in HMGB1-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis mouse model. Aloin significantly reduced HMGB1 release in LPS-activated HUVECs via SIRT1-mediated HMGB1 deacetylation and the PI3K/Nrf2/heme oxygenase (HO)-1 signaling axis. Aloin also suppressed the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-  and interleukin (IL)-6, as well as the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-   and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) by HMGB1. Moreover, aloin restored HMGB1-mediated vascular disruption and inhibited vascular hyperpermeability in mice. In addition, treatment with aloin reduced the CLP-induced release of HMGB1, sepsis-related mortality and tissue injury . Our results suggest that aloin reduces HMGB1 release and sepsis-related mortality by activating SIRT1 and PI3K/Nrf2/HO-1 signals, indicating that aloin has potential for the treatment of sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384543>Menthol-modified casein nanoparticles loading 10-hydroxycamptothecin for glioma targeting therapy.</a></h2><p>Chemotherapy outcomes for the treatment of glioma remains unsatisfactory due to the inefficient drug transport across the blood-brain  (BBB) and insufficient drug accumulation in the tumor region. Although many approaches, including various nanosystems, have been developed to promote the distribution of chemotherapeutics in the brain tumor, the delivery efficiency and the possible damage to the normal brain  still greatly restrict the clinical application of the nanocarriers. Therefore, it is urgent and necessary to discover more safe and effective BBB penetration and glioma-targeting strategies. In the present study, menthol, one of the strongest BBB penetration enhancers screened from traditional Chinese medicine, was conjugated to casein, a natural food protein with brain targeting capability. Then the conjugate self-assembled into the nanoparticles to load anti-cancer drugs. The nanoparticles were characterized to have appropriate size, spheroid shape and high loading drug capacity. Tumor spheroid penetration experiments demonstrated that penetration ability of menthol-modified casein nanoparticles (M-CA-NP) into the tumor were much deeper than that of unmodified nanoparticles.  imaging further verified that M-CA-NPs exhibited higher brain tumor distribution than unmodified nanoparticles. The median survival time of glioma-bearing mice treated with HCPT-M-CA-NPs was significantly prolonged than those treated with free HCPT or HCPT-CA-NPs. HE staining of the organs indicated the safety of the nanoparticles. Therefore, the study combined the advantages of traditional Chinese medicine strategy with modern delivery technology for brain targeting, and provide a safe and effective approach for glioma therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30938196>GLP-1's role in neuroprotection: a systematic review.</a></h2><p>Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a target for treatment of diabetes; however, its  in the brain is not well studied.

While many of the infertility cases are due to known causes, idiopathic infertility is reported in 30% of the infertile couples. In such cases, 18% of the infertile males carry antisperm antibodies (ASAs). Such data are lacking in livestock, wherein 20-30% of the animals are being culled due to low fertility. In males, the blood-testis  (BTB) and biomolecules in the semen provide an immuno-tolerant microenvironment for spermatozoa as they traverse the immunologic milieu of both the male and female reproductive tracts. For example, insults from environmental contaminants, infections and inflammatory conditions are likely to impact the immune privilege state of the testis and fertility. The female mucosal immune system can recognize allogenic spermatozoa-specific proteins affecting sperm kinematics and sperm-zona binding leading to immune infertility. Elucidating the functions and pathways of the immune regulatory molecules associated with fertilization are prerequisites for understanding their impact on fertility. An insight into biomolecules associated with spermatozoal immune tolerance may generate inputs to develop diagnostic tools and modulate fertility. High-throughput sequencing technologies coupled with bioinformatics analyses provides a path forward to define the array of molecules influencing pregnancy outcome. This review discusses the seminal immune regulatory molecules from their origin in the testis until they traverse the uterine environment enabling fertilization and embryonic development. Well-designed experiments and the identification of biomarkers may provide a pathway to understand the finer details of reproductive immunology that will afford personalized therapies.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30937892>The interplay between glioblastoma and microglia cells leads to endothelial cell monolayer dysfunction via the interleukin-6-induced JAK2/STAT3 pathway.</a></h2><p>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, with an average life expectancy of 12-15 months. GBM is highly infiltrated by microglial cells (MG) promoting tumor growth and invasiveness. Moreover, microglia activation and subsequent neuroinflammation seem to be involved in blood-brain  (BBB) dysfunction commonly observed in several central nervous system diseases, including brain tumors. Nevertheless, how the crosstalk between microglia and tumor cells interferes with BBB  is far from being clarified. Herein, we evaluated the effects of reciprocal interactions between MG and GBM cells in the  properties of brain endothelial cells (ECs), using an in vitro approach. The exposure of ECs to the inflammatory microenvironment mediated by MG-GBM crosstalk induced a decrease in the transendothelial electric resistance and an increase in permeability across the ECs (macromolecular flux of 4 kDa-fluorescein isothiocyanate and 70 kDa-Rhodamine  isothiocyanate-Dextran). These effects were accompanied by a downregulation of the intercellular junction proteins, β-catenin and zonula occludens. Moreover, the dynamic interaction between microglia and tumor cells triggered the release of interleukin-6 (IL-6) by microglia and subsequent activation of the downstream Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. Interestingly, the depletion of IL-6 or the blockade of the JAK/STAT3 signaling with AG490 were able to prevent the EC hyperpermeability. Overall, we demonstrated that IL-6 released during MG-GBM crosstalk leads to  dysfunction through the activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway in ECs and downregulation of intercellular junction proteins. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the disruption of BBB permeability in GBM.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31373519>The association of depression stigma with barriers to seeking mental health care: a cross-sectional analysis.</a></h2><p> Stigma is one of several barriers to seeking mental health care. However, few studies have examined how stigma relates to other common barriers (e.g. attitudes about treatment, cost, time).  This study investigated whether depression stigma (internalized or perceived) was related to other treatment-seeking barriers (attitudinal, structural) and whether depression severity influenced the strength of the association.  We used multivariable-adjusted linear regression to model  outcomes as a  of internalized and perceived stigma in an undergraduate population (=2551). We evaluated potential effect modification by depression severity using likelihood-ratio tests.  Internalized stigma displayed a stronger association with overall barriers to care (including perceived need, negative treatment expectations, and structural barriers) than did perceived stigma. Higher internalized stigma predicted a stronger emphasis on each  to treatment measured. Sub-components of internalized stigma (e.g. alienation, stereotype endorsement) uniquely predicted a greater emphasis on distinct barriers.  Internalized stigma is strongly linked to greater perception of barriers to mental health care. It may be necessary to address stigma and barriers concurrently rather than independently.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31119977>Regulation of interferon signaling in response to gut microbes by autophagy.</a></h2><p>The cellular degradative pathway of autophagy prevents unrestrained inflammatory signaling by removing intracellular microbes, damaged organelles, and other factors that trigger immune reactions. Consistent with this , a common variant of the autophagy gene  is associated with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a disorder characterized by a chronic immune reaction directed against the gut microbiota. We recently contributed to our understanding of the link between autophagy and inflammatory signaling in the intestine by demonstrating that autophagy proteins including ATG16L1 are necessary in the epithelium to prevent a spontaneous type I interferon response to the gut microbiota. Enhanced innate immunity that occurs upon autophagy inhibition is protective in mouse models of infection by an enteric bacterial pathogen and acute epithelial injury. Although avoiding excess immune reactions towards the microbiota is necessary to prevent IBD, these observations indicate that autophagy hampers productive immunity at the intestinal epithelial  in certain contexts. Here, we discuss how this counterintuitive consequence of autophagy inhibition can be reconciled with the established beneficial role of the pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31414732>Effect of PI3K/PKB signal pathway inhibitor wortmannin pretreatment on intestinal   in severe acute pancreatitic rats.</a></h2><p>It is well-known that severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) due to infection is mainly caused by intestinal bacterial translocation. The intestinal  is tasked with preventing intestinal pathogenic bacteria and toxins from reaching the parenteral tissues through the intestinal wall. Therefore, maintaining intestinal   may be the key to preventing damage from acute pancreatitis (AP). The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase  pathway (PI3K/PKB) plays a role in AP. However, the exact effect of PI3K/PKB on injury associated with SAP has not yet been found.The present study was aimed at investigating the impact of wortmannin (WT), a PI3K/PKB inhibitor, on intestinal   in SAP rats.The rats were divided into 3 groups: 1) the Sham Surgery group (SS), whose duodenum and pancreas were flipped 3 times (n = 18); 2) the pancreatitis group (SAP), who were injected through retrograde pancreatic duct injection with 5% sodium taurocholate (n = 18); and 3) the WSAP intervention group (SAP+WT). Serum alpha-amylase levels, plasma endogenous endotoxin, hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, intestinal mucosa electron microscopy, intestinal permeability, and expression of p-PKB (phosphorylated protein kinase ) were measured.In our findings under an electron microscope, the SAP group presented cell edema and mitochondrial vacuolated degeneration, sparsely arranged microvilli, tight junction damage, and widening, while the WSAP group exhibited less change and lower pancreas scores (7.4 ±1.14, 10.2 ±1.48 and 12.0 ±1.58 for 3 h, 6 h and 12 h, respectively) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the plasma endogenous endotoxin levels and Evans blue content of the WSAP group was significantly lower at all timepoints than in the SAP group (p < 0.05). Western blotting showed that p-PKB expression was lower in the WSAP group than in the SAP group (p < 0.05). Our study suggests that WT relieves intestinal permeability changes in SAP rats and may be dose-dependent.The PI3K/PKB signal pathway may involve SAP-related intestinal injuries and WT may relieve SAP intestinal injuries through the PI3K/PKB pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901514>[The role of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in neurodegenerative processes and in the neuroregeneration mechanisms induced by increased physical activity].</a></h2><p>The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) belongs to the family of neurotrophins synthesized in the central and peripheral nervous system.

In plants,  vitamins have surprising emerging roles in development, stress tolerance and pathogen resistance. Hence, there is a paramount interest in understanding the regulation of vitamin biosynthesis as well as the consequences of vitamin deficiency in crop species. To facilitate genetic analysis of  vitamin biosynthesis and functions in maize, we have mined the UniformMu transposon resource to identify insertional mutations in vitamin pathway genes. A screen of 190 insertion lines for seed and seedling phenotypes identified mutations in biotin, pyridoxine and niacin biosynthetic pathways. Importantly, isolation of independent insertion alleles enabled genetic confirmation of genotype-to-phenotype associations. Because  vitamins are essential for survival, null mutations often have embryo lethal phenotypes that prevent elucidation of subtle, but physiologically important, metabolic consequences of sub-optimal (functional) vitamin status. To circumvent this , we demonstrate a strategy for refined genetic manipulation of vitamin status based on construction of heterozygotes that combine strong and hypomorphic mutant alleles. Dosage analysis of pdx2 alleles in endosperm revealed that endosperm supplies pyridoxine to the developing embryo. Similarly, a hypomorphic bio1 allele enabled analysis of transcriptome and metabolome responses to incipient biotin deficiency in seedling leaves. We show that systemic pipecolic acid accumulation is an early metabolic response to sub-optimal biotin status highlighting an intriguing connection between biotin, lysine metabolism and systemic disease resistance signaling.

Placenta from obese mothers showed blood vessel immaturity, hypoxia, increased transcript levels of inflammation, autophagy and altered levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers. These data suggest that maternal intestinal changes probably contribute to adverse placental adaptations and also impart an increased risk of obesity in the offspring via alterations in fetal gut development.Shifts in maternal intestinal microbiota have been implicated in metabolic adaptations to pregnancy. In the present study, we generated cohorts of female C57BL/6J mice fed a control (17% kcal fat, n = 10-14) or a high-fat diet (HFD 60% kcal from fat, n = 10-14; ad libitum) aiming to investigate the impact on the maternal gut microbiota, intestinal inflammation and gut  integrity, placental inflammation and fetal intestinal development at embryonic day 18.5. HFD was associated with decreased relative abundances of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producing genera during pregnancy. These diet-induced shifts paralleled decreased maternal intestinal mRNA levels of SCFA receptor Gpr41, modestly decreased cecal butyrate, and altered mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines and immune cell markers in the maternal intestine. Maternal HFD resulted in impaired gut  integrity, with corresponding increases in circulating maternal levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumour necrosis factor. Placentas from HFD dams demonstrated blood vessel immaturity and hypoxia; decreased free carnitine, acylcarnitine derivatives and trimethylamine-N-oxide; and altered mRNA levels of inflammation, autophagy, and ER stress markers. HFD exposed fetuses had increased activation of nuclear factor-kappa  and inhibition of the unfolded protein response in the developing intestine. Taken together, these data suggest that HFD intake prior to and during pregnancy shifts the composition of the maternal gut microbiota and impairs gut  integrity, resulting in increased maternal circulating LPS, which may ultimate contribute to changes in placental vascularization and fetal gut development.© 2019 The Authors.

After each group of cells were challenged with LPS, the cell activity was detected by the cell proliferation and toxicity kit (CCK-8); the cell migration ability was detected by cell scratch experiments; the abilities of cells migration were measured by scratch-wound-healing assay; the apoptosis of cells were evaluated using flow cytometry; the endothelial  of cells was assessed by Transwell and Evans blue; the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL-1β, IL-6) were detected by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); the expressions of nuclear factor-Κ (NF-Κ) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway were detected by Western Blot.Compared with blank control group, the cell viability in LPS group was significantly decreased, and the migration ability, number of apoptotic cells, and  permeability of endothelial cells was significantly increased, the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were significantly increased, and the expressions of phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK), phosphorylation of p38MAPK (p-p38MAPK), phosphorylation of transforming growth factor kinase 1 (p-TAK1) and phosphorylation of NF-ΚBp65 (p-NF-ΚBp65) were significantly increased. It indicated that LPS could stimulate the inflammatory response of vascular endothelial cells, and had a significant impact on cell activity, apoptosis and . There was no significant difference in above indexes between FXa+LPS group and LPS group, except for the level of IL-6 being higher in FXa+LPS group. Compared with FXa+LPS group, in FXa+RIV+LPS group, the cell activity was significantly increased (A value: 0.42±0.02 vs. 0.33±0.02), and migration ability was significantly decreased (folds: 1.78±0.17 vs. 2.24±0.20), the number of apoptotic cells was significantly decreased [(11.30±0.70)% vs. (21.03±0.19)%], and permeability of monolayers endothelial cells was significantly decreased [(149±12)% vs. (253±15)%], the levels of inflammatory cytokines were significantly decreased [IL-1β (ng/L): 163.2±20.7 vs. 477.8±20.2, IL-6 (ng/L): 69.3±0.5 vs. 238.0±24.1, TNF-α (ng/L): 117.0±13.1 vs. 196.2±4.5], the expressions of p-TAK1 and p-NF-ΚBp65 were significantly decreased (p-TAK1/TAK1: 0.74±0.09 vs. 1.85±0.15, p-NF-ΚBp65/NF-ΚBp65: 1.15±0.17 vs. 2.36±0.20), with statistically significant differences (all P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the p-JNK, p-p38MAPK expressions between FXa+RIV+LPS group and FXa+LPS group (p-JNK/JNK: 1.64±0.12 vs. 1.65±0.15, p-p38MAPK/p38MAPK: 2.31±0.32 vs. 2.35±0.20, both P > 0.05).Rivaroxaban can effectively relieve the inflammatory response of HUVEC stimulated by LPS, which may be related to the inhibition of NF-Κ signaling pathway activation rather than MAPK signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501263>Hepatitis C Virus Structure: Defined by What It Is Not.</a></h2><p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) represents an important and growing public health problem, chronically infecting an estimated 70 million people worldwide. This blood-borne pathogen is generating a new wave of infections in the United States, associated with increasing intravenous drug use over the last decade. In most cases, HCV establishes a chronic infection, sometimes causing cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although a curative therapy exists, it is extremely expensive and provides no  to reinfection; therefore, a vaccine is urgently needed. The virion is asymmetric and heterogeneous with the buoyancy and protein content similar to low-density lipoparticles. Core protein is unstructured, and of the two envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2, the  of E1 remains enigmatic. E2 is responsible for specifically binding host receptors CD81 and scavenger receptor class  type I (SR-BI). This review will focus on structural progress on HCV virion, core protein, envelope glycoproteins, and specific host receptors.Copyright © 2019 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636846>Alleviation of Ultraviolet -Induced Photoaging by 7-MEGA 500 in Hairless Mouse Skin.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of 7-MEGA™ 500 on the improvement of skin aging in an UVB-induced photo-aging model of hairless mice.

Nevertheless, the success rate of this type of therapy is often low due to intrinsic or acquired mechanisms of chemoresistance. Among them, drug extrusion from cancer cells through ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins plays an important role. ABC pumps are primary active transporters involved in the  and secretory functions of many healthy cells. : In this review, we have used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to explore the relationship between the expression of the major ABC proteins involved in cancer chemoresistance in the most common types of cancer, and the drugs used in the treatment of these tumors that are substrates of these pumps. : From unicellular organisms to humans, several ABC proteins play a major role in detoxification processes. Cancer cells exploit this ability to protect themselves from cytostatic drugs. Among the ABC pumps, MDR1, MRPs and BCRP are able to export many antitumor drugs and are expressed in several types of cancer, and further up-regulated during treatment. This event results in the enhanced ability of tumor cells to reduce intracellular drug concentrations and hence the pharmacological effect of chemotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31119381>Dissemination of non-typhoidal Salmonella during Plasmodium chabaudi infection affects anti-malarial immunity.</a></h2><p>Malaria-associated bacteremia accounts for up to one-third of deaths from severe malaria, and non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) has been reported as a major complication of severe malarial infection. Patients who develop NTS bacteremia during Plasmodium infection show higher mortality rates than individuals with malaria alone. Systemic bacteremia can be caused by a wound or translocation from epithelial or endothelial sites. NTS is an intestinal pathogen, however the contribution of bacterial translocation from the intestinal tract during Plasmodium infection is not well studied. Here, we investigated the integrity of the intestinal   of P. chabaudi-infected mice using large molecules and Salmonella infection. Intestinal histology and the adaptive immune response to malaria were also studied using light microscopy and flow cytometry. P. chabaudi infection compromised intestinal  , which led to increased intestinal cellular infiltration. In addition, we observed increased serum lipopolysaccharide binding protein and leakage of soluble molecules from the intestine into the blood in infected mice. Plasmodium infection also increased intestinal translocation and dissemination of NTS to the liver. The adaptive immune response to P. chabaudi infection was also significantly impacted by NTS translocation. Reduced  and T cell activation were observed in co-infected animals, suggesting interference in the malaria-specific immune responses by bacteremia. These studies demonstrate that P. chabaudi infection induces failure of the   of the intestinal wall and enhanced intestinal bacterial translocation, affecting anti-malarial immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31114672>Functional characterization of SLC26A3 c.392C>G (p.P131R) mutation in intestinal   using CRISPR/CAS9-created cell models.</a></h2><p>Congenital chloride diarrhea (CCD) in a newborn is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with life-threatening complications, requiring early diagnostics and treatment to prevent severe dehydration and infant mortality. SLC26A3 rs386833481 (c.392C>G; p.P131R) gene polymorphism is an important genetic determinant of CCD. Here, we report the influence of the non-synonymous SLC26A3 variant rs386833481 gene polymorphism on the  of the epithelial  and the potential mechanisms of these effects.We found that P131R-SLC26A3 increased dysfunction of the epithelial  compared with wild type SLC26A3 in human colonic Caco-2 and mouse colonic CMT-93 cells. When P131R-SLC26A3 was subsequently reverted to wild type, the epithelial   was restored similar to wild type cells. Further study demonstrated that variant P131R-SLC26A3 disrupts  of epithelial  through two distinct molecular mechanisms: (a) decreasing SLC26A3 expression through a ubiquitination pathway and () disrupting a key interaction with its partner ZO-1/CFTR, thereby increasing the epithelial permeability.Our study provides an important insight of SLC26A3 SNPs in the regulation of the epithelial permeability and indicates that SLC26A3 rs386833481 is likely a causative mutation in the dysfunction of epithelial  of CCD, and correction of this SNP or increasing SLC26A3  could be therapeutically beneficial for chronic diarrhea diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30935894>Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate improves visceral sensation and gut  in a rat model of irritable bowel syndrome.</a></h2><p>Stress-induced altered visceral sensation and impaired gut  play an important role in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). These responses were demonstrated to be peripheral corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) dependent and also mediated via proinflammatory cytokine in animal IBS model. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) is known to have anti-inflammatory properties by suppressing proinflammatory cytokine release. We hypothesized that DHEA-S improves stress-induced visceral changes and is beneficial for IBS treatment. We explored the effects of DHEA-S on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or repeated water avoidance stress (WAS)-induced visceral allodynia and increased colonic permeability (rat IBS models). The threshold of visceromotor response, i.e. abdominal muscle contractions induced by colonic balloon distention was electrophysiologically measured. Colonic permeability was estimated in vivo by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue in colonic tissue. DHEA-S abolished visceral allodynia and colonic hyperpermeability induced by LPS in a dose-dependent manner. It also blocked repeated WAS- or peripheral injection of CRF-induced visceral changes. These effects by DHEA-S in LPS model were reversed by bicuculline, a γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonist, N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a nitric oxide (NO) synthesis inhibitor, naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, or sulpiride, a dopamine D receptor antagonist. However, domperidone, a peripheral dopamine D receptor antagonist did not modify the effects. Peripheral injection of astressin-, a selective CRF receptor subtype 2 (CRF) antagonist also reversed these effects. In conclusion, DHEA-S blocked stress-induced visceral changes via GABA, NO, opioid, central dopamine D and peripheral CRF signaling. DHEA-S may be useful for IBS treating.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Reports show that seizures increase brain glutamate levels, leading to  dysfunction. One component of  dysfunction is overexpression of the drug efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Based on our previous studies, we hypothesized that glutamate released during seizures activates cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), resulting in P-gp and BCRP overexpression. We exposed isolated rat brain capillaries to glutamate  and used an - approach of isolating brain capillaries from rats after status epilepticus (SE) and in chronic epileptic (CE) rats. Glutamate increased cPLA2, P-gp, and BCRP protein and activity levels in isolated brain capillaries. We confirmed the role of cPLA2 in the signaling pathway in brain capillaries from male and female mice lacking cPLA2. We also demonstrated, , that cPLA2 inhibition prevents overexpression of P-gp and BCRP at the blood-brain  in rats after status epilepticus and in CE rats.

The plasma membrane is the first  that prevents direct translocation of chemic entities, and thus obstructs their efficient intracellular delivery. Generally, hydrophilic small molecule drugs are poor permeability that reduce bioavailability and thus limit the clinic application. The cellular uptake of macromolecules and drug carriers is very inefficient without external assistance. Therefore, it is desirable to develop potent delivery systems for achieving effective intracellular delivery of chemic entities. Apart from of the types of delivery strategies, the composition of the cell membrane is critical for delivery efficiency due to the fact that cellular uptake is affected by the interaction between the chemical entity and the plasma membrane. In this review, we aimed to develop a profound understanding of the interactions between delivery systems and components of the plasma membrane. For the purpose, we attempt to present a broad overview of what delivery systems can be used to enhance the intracellular delivery of poorly permeable chemic entities, and how various delivery strategies are applied according to the components of plasma membrane.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30892034>Oral Administration of Bovine Lactoferrin-Derived Lactoferricin (Lfcin)  Could Attenuate Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 Induced Intestinal Disease through Improving Intestinal   and Microbiota.</a></h2><p>Lactoferricin (Lfcin) , derived from lactoferrin in whey, has attracted considerable attention because of its multiple biological functions. Zoonotic enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 has adverse effects on intestinal epithelial  , leading to serious intestinal disease. In this study, the EHEC O157:H7-induced intestinal dysfunction model was developed to investigate the effects of Lfcin  on EHEC O157:H7-induced epithelial  disruption and microbiota dysbiosis. Results showed that the inflammatory infiltration indexes in the jejunum of Lfcin -treated animals were significantly decreased. Lfcin  administration also significantly improved ZO-1 and occludin expression following O157:H7-induced injury. Finally, microbiota analysis of the cecal samples revealed that Lfcin  inhibited the O157:H7-induced abnormal increase in Bacteroides. Therefore, Lfcin  efficiently attenuated O157:H7-induced epithelial  damage and dysregulation of inflammation status, while maintaining microbiota homeostasis in the intestine, indicating that it may be an excellent food source for prevention and therapy of EHEC O157:H7-related intestinal dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987439>Nanoparticle-based drug delivery in the inner ear: current challenges, limitations and opportunities.</a></h2><p>Hearing loss is the most common neurosensory impairment worldwide. While conductive hearing loss can be managed by surgery, the management of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), related to the damage of sensory cells of the inner ear is more challenging to manage medically. Many causes of SNHL such as sudden idiopathic SNHL, Meniere's disease, noise-induced hearing loss, autoimmune hearing loss or hearing loss from exposure to ototoxic substances can benefit from delivery of otoprotective drugs to the inner ear. However, systemic drug delivery through oral, intravenous and intramuscular methods leads to undesirable side effects due to the inner ear's limited blood supply and the relatively poor penetration of the blood-inner ear  (BLB). Therefore, there has been an increased interest for the targeted drug delivery to the inner ear using nanoparticles. Drug delivery through nanoparticles offers several advantages including drug stabilization for controlled release and surface modification for specific targeting. Understanding the biocompatibility of nanoparticles with cochlea and developing novel non-invasive delivery methods will promote the translation of nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery for auditory disorders from bench to bedside.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31026414>Neuroinflammation During RNA Viral Infections.</a></h2><p>Neurotropic RNA viruses continue to emerge and are increasingly linked to diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) despite viral clearance. Indeed, the overall mortality of viral encephalitis in immunocompetent individuals is low, suggesting efficient mechanisms of virologic control within the CNS. Both immune and neural cells participate in this process, which requires extensive innate immune signaling between resident and infiltrating cells, including microglia and monocytes, that regulate the effector functions of antiviral T and  cells as they gain access to CNS compartments. While these interactions promote viral clearance via mainly neuroprotective mechanisms, they may also promote neuropathology and, in some cases, induce persistent alterations in CNS  and  that manifest as neurologic and psychiatric diseases. This review discusses mechanisms of RNA virus clearance and neurotoxicity during viral encephalitis with a focus on the cytokines essential for immune and neural cell inflammatory responses and interactions. Understanding neuroimmune communications in the setting of viral infections is essential for the development of treatments that augment neuroprotective processes while limiting ongoing immunopathological processes that cause ongoing CNS disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451696>Unique transcriptional and protein-expression signature in human lung tissue-resident NK cells.</a></h2><p>Human lung tissue-resident NK cells (trNK cells) are likely to play an important role in host responses towards viral infections, inflammatory conditions and cancer. However, detailed insights into these cells are still largely lacking. Here we show, using RNA sequencing and flow cytometry-based analyses, that subsets of human lung CD69CD16 NK cells display hallmarks of tissue-residency, including high expression of CD49a, CD103, and ZNF683, and reduced expression of SELL, S1PR5, and KLF2/3. CD49aCD16 NK cells are functionally competent, and produce IFN-γ, TNF, MIP-1β, and GM-CSF. After stimulation with IL-15, they upregulate perforin, granzyme , and Ki67 to a similar degree as CD49aCD16 NK cells. Comparing datasets from trNK cells in human lung and bone marrow with tissue-resident memory CD8 T cells identifies core genes co-regulated either by tissue-residency, cell-type or location.

Accordingly, human but not avian IAVs efficiently escape the antiviral activity of MxA due to adaptive mutations in their viral nucleoprotein. Partial MxA resistance can be acquired in intermediate hosts such as swine, which possess an antivirally active Mx1 protein. Intriguingly, Mx1 of the bat Carollia perspicillata, a host of the recently discovered bat influenza A-like virus H18N11, is antivirally active against avian IAVs, thus raising the question whether H18N11 has undergone a preadaptation to human MxA. Here, by utilizing a chimeric bat influenza virus, PR8-H18N11, we demonstrate that MxA efficiently blocks viral replication in vitro as well as in MxA transgenic mice. Nevertheless, the H18N11 nucleoprotein exhibits partial MxA resistance in a polymerase reconstitution assay, suggesting that a certain degree of MxA preadaptation occurred. Together, our data indicate a currently reduced risk for H18N11 to overcome the human restriction factor MxA. Further adaptive mutations in NP are required to facilitate full MxA escape.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666521>Unique structure and  of viral rhodopsins.</a></h2><p>Recently, two groups of rhodopsin genes were identified in large double-stranded DNA viruses. The structure and  of viral rhodopsins are unknown. We present functional characterization and high-resolution structure of an Organic Lake Phycodnavirus rhodopsin II (OLPVRII) of group 2. It forms a pentamer, with a symmetrical, bottle-like central channel with the narrow vestibule in the cytoplasmic part covered by a ring of 5 arginines, whereas 5 phenylalanines form a hydrophobic  in its exit. The proton donor E42 is placed in the helix . The structure is unique among the known rhodopsins. Structural and functional data and molecular dynamics suggest that OLPVRII might be a light-gated pentameric ion channel analogous to pentameric ligand-gated ion channels, however, future patch clamp experiments should prove this directly.

Clearance rate depends on different factors such as light irradiation, skin oxygenation and drug penetration. The poor penetration of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) with topical application is limited and restrains the production of PpIX which could restrict PDT outcomes. This review will focus on techniques already used to enhance drug penetration in human skin, and will present their results, advantages, and drawbacks. Chemical and physical pretreatments will be discussed. Chemical pre-treatments comprise of drug formulation modification, use of agents that modify the heme cycle, enhance PpIX formation, and the combination of differentiation-promoting agent prior to PDT. On the other hand, physical pretreatments affect the skin  by creating holes in the skin or by removing stratum corneum. To promote drug penetration, iontophoresis and temperature modulation are interesting alternative methods. Cellular mechanisms enrolled during chemical or physical pretreatments have been investigated in order to understand how 5-ALA penetrates the skin, why it is preferentially metabolized in PpIX in tumour cells, and how it could be accumulated in deeper skin layers. The objective of this review is to compare clinical trials that use innovative technology to conventional PDT treatment.

Autophagy is vital for cell survival and cell death in central nervous system injury, but the role of autophagy in traumatic optic nerve injury remains uncertain. Optic nerve crush is a robust model of traumatic optic nerve injury. p62 siRNA and rapamycin are autophagy inducers and have different neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system. In this study, p62 and rapamycin induced autophagy, but only p62 siRNA treatment provided a favorable protective effect in visual  and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival. Moreover, the number of macrophages at the optic nerve lesion site was lower in the p62-siRNA-treated group than in the other groups. p62 siRNA induced more M2 macrophage polarization than rapamycin did. Rapamycin inhibited both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation, whereas p62 siRNA inhibited only mTORC1 activation and maintained mTORC2 and Akt activation. Inhibition of mTORC2-induced Akt activation resulted in blood-optic nerve  disruption. Combined treatment with rapamycin and the mTORC2 activator SC79 improved RGC survival. Overall, our findings suggest that mTORC2 activation after autophagy induction is necessary for the neuroprotection of RGCs in traumatic optic nerve injury and may lead to new clinical applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31139336>Providing carbon skeletons to sustain amide synthesis in roots underlines the suitability of  for the study of ammonium stress in cereals.</a></h2><p>Plants mainly acquire N from the soil in the form of nitrate (NO ) or ammonium (NH ). Ammonium-based nutrition is gaining interest because it helps to avoid the environmental pollution associated with nitrate fertilization. However, in general, plants prefer NO  and indeed, when growing only with NH  they can encounter so-called ammonium stress. Since  is a useful model species for the study of monocot  and genetics, we chose it to characterize performance under ammonium nutrition.  Bd21 plants were grown hydroponically in 1 or 2.5 mM NO  or NH . Nitrogen and carbon metabolism associated with NH  assimilation was evaluated in terms of tissue contents of NO , NH , K, Mg, Ca, amino acids and organic acids together with tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and NH -assimilating enzyme activities and RNA transcript levels. The roots behaved as a physiological  preventing NH  translocation to aerial parts, as indicated by a sizeable accumulation of NH , Asn and Gln in the roots. A continuing high NH  assimilation rate was made possible by a tuning of the TCA cycle and its associated anaplerotic pathways to match 2-oxoglutarate and oxaloacetate demand for Gln and Asn synthesis.

The aim of this study was to review the effects of the essential metals zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) on the central nervous system (CNS), as well as the mechanisms involved in their neurotoxicity. Low levels of Zn as well as high levels of Cu, Mn, and Fe participate in the activation of signaling pathways of the inflammatory, oxidative and nitrosative stress (IO&NS) response, including nuclear factor kappa  and activator protein-1. The imbalance of these metals impairs the structural, regulatory, and catalytic functions of different enzymes, proteins, receptors, and transporters. Neurodegeneration occurs via association of metals with proteins and subsequent induction of aggregate formation creating a vicious cycle by disrupting mitochondrial , which depletes adenosine triphosphate and induces IO&NS, cell death by apoptotic and/or necrotic mechanisms. In AD, at low levels, Zn suppresses β-amyloid-induced neurotoxicity by selectively precipitating aggregation intermediates; however, at high levels, the binding of Zn to β-amyloid may enhance formation of fibrillar β-amyloid aggregation, leading to neurodegeneration. High levels of Cu, Mn and Fe participate in the formation α-synuclein aggregates in intracellular inclusions, called Lewy Body, that result in synaptic dysfunction and interruption of axonal transport. In PD, there is focal accumulation of Fe in the substantia nigra, while in AD a diffuse accumulation of Fe occurs in various regions, such as cortex and hippocampus, with Fe marginally increased in the senile plaques. Zn deficiency induces an imbalance between T helper (Th)1 and Th2 cell functions and a failure of Th17 down-regulation, contributing to the pathogenesis of MS. In MS, elevated levels of Fe occur in certain brain regions, such as thalamus and striatum, which may be due to inflammatory processes disrupting the blood-brain  and attracting Fe-rich macrophages. Delineating the specific mechanisms by which metals alter redox homeostasis is essential to understand the pathophysiology of AD, PD, and MS and may provide possible new targets for their prevention and treatment of the patients affected by these NDDs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Naltrexone is one of the rare TLR4 antagonists with good blood-brain  permeability and showing no stereoselectivity for TLR4. By linking 2 naltrexone units through a rigid pyrrole spacer, the bivalent ligand norbinaltorphimine was formed. Interestingly, (+)-norbinaltorphimine [(+)-1] showed ∼25 times better TLR4 antagonist activity than naltrexone in microglial BV-2 cell line, whereas (-)-norbinaltorphimine [(-)-1] lost TLR4 activity. The enantioselectivity of norbinaltorphimine was further confirmed in primary microglia, astrocytes, and macrophages. The activities of meso isomer of norbinaltorphimine and the molecular dynamic simulation results demonstrate that the stereochemistry of (+)-1 is derived from the (+)-naltrexone pharmacophore.

Growing broilers were fed the basal diet or diets supplemented with 300 or 600 mg/kg PCA, or 200 mg/kg enramycin for 52 D. We found that addition of 300 mg/kg PCA significantly increased body weight, live weight, and carcass weight and decreased the feed to gain ratio of broilers; PCA improved meat quality through reducing shear force, and increasing a* (relative redness) and decreasing * (relative yellowness) at 24 h after slaughter. The activities of alkaline phosphatase and diamine oxidase in plasma were significantly decreased by administration of 300 mg/kg PCA; PCA also significantly increased total antioxidant capability and decreased malondialdehyde content and activity of xanthine oxidase in liver. Meanwhile, it enhanced activities of total superoxide dismutase, glutathione s-transferase, and glutathione peroxidase in the jejunal mucosa. Interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-β were significantly increased in jejunal mucosa and plasma of 300 mg/kg PCA diet group, whereas interluekin-2 and interferon-γ dropped dramatically. Moreover, relative expression of apoptosis-related genes decreased in liver, whereas that of intestinal -related and immunity-related genes increased in jejunum. Furthermore, 300 mg/kg PCA treatment significantly changed α-diversity and structure of the cecal microflora in broilers, with increasing relative abundance of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria while reducing Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. These results indicated that PCA improved the feed efficiency, growth performance, meat quality of broilers, and antioxidant capacity. It also enhanced intestinal immune  and improved the structure of intestinal flora to favor improved intestinal health in Chinese yellow-feathered broilers.© The Author(s) 2019.

This study aimed to investigate activation of the Tropomyosin-related kinase receptor  (TrkB) and its downstream signaling pathway on preserving BBB breakdown after experimental SAH. An endovascular perforation SAH model was applied. N-[2-(5-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl) ethyl]-2- oxopiperidine-3-carboxamide (HIOC), the derivative of N-acetyl serotonin (NAS), was intracerebroventricularly administered 3 h after SAH induction. The neurologic scores and brain water content were evaluated in an outcome study. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining were used to investigate the mechanism. The results indicated that HIOC activated the TrkB/Akt pathway, increased the tight junction expression, improved neurologic deficits, and ameliorated brain edema after SAH. Thus, we conclude that initiating the TrkB/Akt signaling cascade preserves BBB breakdown after experimental SAH in rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31237798>Roles of M receptor in the effect of penehyclidine hydrochloride upregulated beta-arrestin-1 expression in LPS-stimulated HPMVEC.</a></h2><p> This study is to investigate the roles of muscarinic receptor 3 (M receptor) in the effect of penehyclidine hydrochloride (PHC) upregulated beta-arrestin-1 expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (HPMVEC).  HPMVECs were transfected with a shRNA-containing plasmid that specifically targets M receptor mRNA. Cells were collected to measure F-actin contents, levels of intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), as well as changes of F-actin cytoskeleton arrangement by Laser scanning confocal. Beta-arrestin-1 protein expressions were determined by Western blot and beta-arrestin-1 mRNA expressions were measured by Real-time PCR.  Similar to normal cells, PHC could also increase F-actin contents and beta-arrestin-1 expressions, reduce ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expressions, and inhibit LPS-stimulated reorganization of F-actin and formation of stress fiber in M receptor shRNA group. Compared with normal cells, F-actin cytoskeleton was neat, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expressions were decreased, as well as F-actin contents were increased in M receptor shRNA group. However, there were no differences in beta-arrestin-1 expressions between normal cell groups and M receptor shRNA groups.  These results indicate that M receptor plays an important role in pulmonary microvascular endothelial  , and knock-out of M receptor could attenuate LPS-induced pulmonary microvascular endothelial injury. However, upregulative effect of PHC on beta-arrestin-1 expression is independent with presence of M receptor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496325>Oxymatrine protects against l-arginine-induced acute pancreatitis and intestine injury involving Th1/Th17 cytokines and MAPK/NF-κ signalling.</a></h2><p> Oxymatrine (OMT) has various pharmacological effects, including immune reaction regulation, anti-inflammation and anti-hypersensitive reaction.  This is the first report to investigate the molecular mechanism of OMT  in l-arginine (Arg)-induced acute pancreatitis (AP) involving intestinal injury.  Rat pancreatic AR42J and small intestinal IEC-6 cells were treated with Arg (200-800 µM) for 48 h plus OMT (4 mg/mL) treatment. Thirty adult Wistar rats were randomly assigned to control (saline), AP (i.p. of 250 mg/100 g body weight Arg) and OMT (i.p. injection of 50 mg/kg .w. OMT every 6 h following Arg). Both cells and rats were harvested at 48 h.  Arg-induced cell proliferation in both rats AR42J (EC 633.9 ± 31.4 µM) and IEC-6 cells (EC 571.3 ± 40.4 µM) in a dose-dependent manner, which was significantly inhibited by OMT (4 mg/mL). Meanwhile, Arg (600 µM) induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, NF-κ, IL-17A/IL-17F and IFN-γ) and activation of p-p38/p-ERK , which was reversed by OMT. , OMT (50 mg/kg) inhibited 250 mg/100 g of Arg-induced AP involving intestinal injury, including inhibiting Arg-induced inflammatory in pancreas and intestine, inhibiting Arg-induced increase of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, NF-κ and p-p38/p-ERK-MAPK signalling, and inhibiting Arg-induced increase of IL-17A/IL-17F, IFN-γ, ROR-γt and T-bet. Meanwhile, OMT inhibited Arg-induced expression of CD44 and CD55 in intestinal injury.  OMT protects against Arg-induced AP involving intestinal injury via regulating Th1/Th17 cytokines and MAPK/NF-κ signalling, which is a promising therapeutic agent in clinics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31043103>Platelet number in different anticoagulants as a diagnostic biomarker for increased intestinal permeability.</a></h2><p>The main pathological process associated to increased intestinal permeability is the translocation of toxic products, predominantly endotoxins/lipopolysaccharide (LPS), from the intestinal tract into the microcirculation. In blood, LPS binds to surface receptors on immune cells initiating an inflammatory response. LPS can also bind to platelets leading to preactivated platelets that have a lower threshold to be aggregated in presence heparin. The aim of this study was to validate a simple, fast and reliable test for screening LPS-loaded platelets. This test named PANDA (acronym for Platelet Number in Different Anticoagulants) consists in the measurement of the mean platelet number in blood samples collected into EDTA and heparin. We analyzed blood samples from 92 patients with gastrointestinal diseases and 23 healthy volunteers and found a markedly low number of platelets in heparinized blood compared to EDTA-anticoagulated blood in patients but not in healthy volunteers. Furthermore, ex vivo addition of endotoxin to blood samples induced a remarkable decrease in platelet count in heparinized blood of the volunteers but not in the patient's group, where platelets could be previously saturated by endotoxin circulating in blood. Platelet should be counted during the first hour after blood collection, in order to avoid false results due to a progressive platelet aggregation in heparinized blood in  of the time. Our results demonstrated that PANDA test can be used for screening LPS-loaded platelets as an indirect diagnostic biomarker for increased intestinal permeability and also for monitoring the gut   during the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31124371>Bioavailability and metabolism of selected cocoa bioactive compounds: A comprehensive review.</a></h2><p>Cocoa beans and their co-products are a rich source of beneficial compounds for health promotion, including polyphenols and methylxanthines. Knowledge of bioavailability and  bioactivity of these phytochemicals is crucial to understand their role and  in human health. Therefore, many studies concerning bioavailability and bioactivity of cocoa bioactive compound have been done in both  animal models and in humans. This critical review comprehensively summarizes the existing knowledge about the bioavailability and the major metabolic pathways of selected cocoa bioactive compounds (i.e. monomeric flavan-3-ols, procyanidins, anthocyanins, flavonols, phenolic acids, -phenylpropenoyl-L-amino acids, stilbenes, and methylxanthines). The compiled results indicated that many of these compounds undergo extensive metabolism prior to absorption. Different factors have been suggested to influence the bioavailability of polyphenols and methylxanthines among them the role of gut microbiota, structure of these compounds, food matrix and occurrence of other substances were the most often considered. Aforementioned factors decided about the site where these bioactive compounds are digested and absorbed from the alimentary tract, as well as the pathway by which they are metabolized. These factors also determine of the type of transport through the intestine  (passive, involving specific enzymes or mediated by specific transporters) and their metabolic path and profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31215114>Biomaterials and regenerative technologies used in bone regeneration in the craniomaxillofacial region: Consensus report of group 2 of the 15th European Workshop on Periodontology on Bone Regeneration.</a></h2><p>To review the regenerative technologies used in bone regeneration: bone grafts,  membranes, bioactive factors and cell therapies.Four background review publications served to elaborate this consensus report.Biomaterials used as bone grafts must meet specific requirements: biocompatibility, porosity, osteoconductivity, osteoinductivity, surface properties, biodegradability, mechanical properties, angiogenicity, handling and manufacturing processes. Currently used biomaterials have demonstrated advantages and limitations based on the fulfilment of these requirements. Similarly, membranes for guided bone regeneration (GBR) must fulfil specific properties and potential biological mechanisms to improve their clinical applicability. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have evaluated the added effect of bone morphogenetic proteins (mainly BMP-2) and autologous platelet concentrates (APCs) when used as bioactive agents to enhance bone regeneration. Three main approaches using cell therapies to enhance bone regeneration have been evaluated: (a) "minimally manipulated" whole tissue fractions; () ex vivo expanded "uncommitted" stem/progenitor cells; and (c) ex vivo expanded "committed" bone-/periosteum-derived cells. Based on the evidence from clinical trials, transplantation of cells, most commonly whole bone marrow aspirates (BMA) or bone marrow aspirate concentrations (BMAC), in combination with biomaterial scaffolds has demonstrated an additional effect in sinus augmentation and horizontal ridge augmentation, and comparable bone regeneration to autogenous bone in alveolar cleft repair.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Ultraviolet A radiation is the predominant component of sunlight causative of photoaging, while ultraviolet  light is considered a potentiator of photoaging. In addition, different chemicals contribute to skin aging upon penetration through skin  disruption or hair follicles, aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhR) being a major effector mechanism through which toxicity is exerted.  is a polyextremophile Gramineae capable of thriving under extreme environmental conditions. Its aqueous extract (EDA) exhibits anti- photoaging in human skin cells, such as inhibition of MMPs, directly associated with extrinsic aging. EDA prevents cellular damage, attenuating stress responses such as autophagy and reducing cellular death induced by UV. We demonstrate that EDA also protects from dioxin-induced nuclear translocation of AhR and increases the production of loricrin, a marker of homeostasis in differentiated keratinocytes. Thus, our observations suggest a potential use exploiting EDA's protective properties in skin health supplements.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009340>Blood-Brain  Leakage.</a></h2><p>Background and Purpose- The diagnosis of transient ischemic attack is challenging. Evidence of acute ischemia on MRI diffusion-weighted imaging is highly variable and confirmed in only about one-third of patients. This study investigated the significance of blood-brain  dysfunction (BBBD) mapping in patients with transient neurological deficits, as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker required for risk stratification and stroke prevention. Methods- We used dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to quantitatively map BBBD in a prospective cohort study of 57 patients diagnosed with transient ischemic attack/minor stroke and 50 healthy controls. Results- Brain volume with BBBD was significantly higher in patients compared with controls ( P=0.002). BBBD localization corresponded with the clinical presentation in 41 patients (72%) and was more extensive in patients with acute infarct on diffusion-weighted imaging ( P=0.05). Patients who developed new stroke during follow-up had a significantly greater BBBD at the initial presentation ( P=0.03) with a risk ratio of 5.35 for recurrent stroke. Conclusions- This is the first description of the extent and localization of BBBD in patients with transient ischemic attack/minor stroke. We propose BBBD mapping as a valuable tool for detection of subtle brain ischemia and a promising predictive biomarker required for risk stratification and stroke prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450968>Mumps virus infection disrupts blood-testis  through the induction of TNF-α in Sertoli cells.</a></h2><p>Mumps virus (MuV) has high tropism to the testis and may lead to male infertility. Sertoli cells are the major targets of MuV infection. However, the mechanisms by which MuV infection impairs male fertility and Sertoli cell  remain unclear. The present study elucidated the effect of MuV infection on the blood-testis  (BTB). The transepithelial electrical resistance of MuV-infected mouse Sertoli cells was monitored, and the expression of major proteins of the BTB was examined. We demonstrated that MuV infection disrupted the BTB by reducing the levels of occludin and zonula occludens 1. Sertoli cells derived from  and  mice were analyzed for mediating MuV-induced impairment. TLR2-mediated TNF-α production by Sertoli cells in response to MuV infection impaired BTB integrity. MuV-impaired BTB was not observed in  and  Sertoli cells. Moreover, an inhibitor of TNF-α, pomalidomide, prevents the disruption of BTB in response to MuV infection. FITC-labeled biotin tracing assay confirmed that BTB permeability and spermatogenesis were transiently impaired by MuV infection . These findings suggest that the disruption of the BTB could be one of the mechanisms underlying MuV-impaired male fertility, in which TNF-α could play a critical role.-Wu, H., Jiang, X., Gao, Y., Liu, W., Wang, F., Gong, M., Chen, R., Yu, X., Zhang, W., Gao, ., Song, C., Han, D.

Brain pericytes are important regulators of BBB integrity, permeability, and blood flow. Pericyte loss has been implicated in injury; however, how the crosstalk among pericytes, endothelial cells, and astrocytes ultimately leads to BBB dysfunction in traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of pericyte-endothelium interaction in maintaining the BBB . TBI causes the platelet-derived growth factor- (PDGF-)/PDGF receptor-β signaling impairment that results in loss of interaction with endothelium and leads to neurovascular dysfunction. Using in vivo mild (7 psi) and moderate (15 psi) fluid percussion injury (FPI) in mice, we demonstrate the expression of various pericyte markers including PDGFR-β, NG2 and CD13 that were significantly reduced with a subsequent reduction in the expression of various integrins; adherent junction protein, N-cadherin; gap junction protein, connexin-43; and tight junction proteins such as occludin, claudin-5, ZO-1, and JAM-a. Impairment of pericyte-endothelium interaction increases the BBB permeability to water that is marked by a significant increase in aquaporin4 expression in injured animals. Similarly, pericyte-endothelium integrity impairment in FPI animals greatly increases the permeability of small-molecular-weight sodium fluorescein and high-molecular-weight-tracer Evans blue across the BBB. In addition, the injury-inflicted animals show significantly higher levels of S100β and NSE in the blood samples compared with controls. In conclusion, our data provide an insight that brain trauma causes an early impairment of pericyte-endothelium integrity and results in BBB dysregulation that initiates pathological consequences associated with TBI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.
