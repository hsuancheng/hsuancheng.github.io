A range of countries have opted to completely ban the use of antibiotics in animal feed. The animal production industries are looking for alternative ways to effectively control pathogens while providing the performance benefits previously secured by antibiotics in feed. Here, we present evidence that oregano () could be a potential alternative for pathogen control in the poultry industry. Broiler diets were supplemented with oregano powder (0%, 0.5%, 1%, and 2%) for six weeks. The capacity for pathogen control was estimated by microbiota profiling of the jejunum, ileum, and caecum content, and in the faeces, by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The concentrations of short-chain  acids in the caecal content were also measured, as were villus/crypt parameters in the ileum. There were no differences among treatments in weight gain, feed intake, or the concentration of short-chain  acids. The height, width, and the surface area of villi in the ileum were not influenced by oregano addition. However, 1% and 2% of oregano produced a significant increase in the villus height to crypt depth ratio. There were no visible histopathological changes in the  in control and treated groups. Although oregano had no significant effect on overall microbial diversity and gross composition, some specific genera, like ,  and , which include known pathogens, were reduced in relative abundance by oregano treatment. , recognized as a beneficial and probiotic genus, was also suppressed by the oregano treatment.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630224>Risk profiling using metabolomic characteristics for susceptible individuals of drug-induced  injury caused by Polygonum multiflorum.</a></h2><p>Idiosyncratic drug-induced  injury (IDILI) is a rare but potentially severe adverse drug reaction. To date, identifying individuals at risk for IDILI remains challenging. This is a prospective study, where a nested case-control (1:5) design was adopted. For six patients who had abnormalities in  function test after Polygonum multiflorum Thunb. (PM) ingestion (susceptible group), 30 patients with normal  function were matched (tolerant group). Based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, metabolomics analysis was done on serum samples prior to PM ingestion, to screen the differential metabolites and characterize metabolomic profiles of patient serum in the two groups. Multivariate analysis showed that there were remarkable separations between susceptible and tolerant groups. A total of 25 major differential metabolites were screened out, involving glycerophospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism,  acid metabolism, histidine metabolism and aromatic amino acid metabolism. Wherein, the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curves of metabolites PE 22:6, crotonoyl-CoA, 2E-tetradecenoyl-CoA, phenyllactic acid, indole-5,6-quinone, phosphoribosyl-ATP were all greater than 0.9. The overall serum metabolic profile comprising of 25 metabolites could clearly distinguish susceptible and tolerant groups. This proof-of-concept study used metabolomics to characterize the metabolic profile of IDILI risk individuals before drug ingestion for the first time. The metabolome characteristics in patient serum before PM ingestion may predict the risk of  injury after PM ingestion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626136>Risk factors for the development of hyperuricemia: A STROBE-compliant cross-sectional and longitudinal study.</a></h2><p>Hyperuricemia has received increasing attention as a major public health problem. This study aims to investigate the risk factors for hyperuricemia and to explore the relationship between changes in biochemical variables and incident hyperuricemia.A cross-sectional and subsequently prospective study was performed among adults who took their health checkups at Zhejiang University Hospital. The participants who were free of hyperuricemia at baseline received annual follow-up examinations during a 6-year period. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were conducted to calculate the risks for incident hyperuricemia.Of the 9238 participants enrolled, 1704 (18.4%) were diagnosed as hyperuricemia. During 21,757 person-years of follow-up, 1492 incident hyperuricemia cases were identified. The incidence of hyperuricemia was 68.58 cases per 1000 person-year of follow-up in the overall participants. The prevalence and the incidence of hyperuricemia increased greatly in female older than 50 years. High levels of BMI, SBP, FPG, TG, LDL-C, ALT, BUN, and creatinine increased the risk of hyperuricemia. Suffering  also increased the risk of hyperuricemia. Subjects with increasing DBP, TG, BUN, creatinine, or decreasing HDL-C were more likely to incident hyperuricemia.This study revealed that the change of diastolic blood pressure (DBP), serum triglycerides (TG), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level were independently associated with incident hyperuricemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655133>β-Klotho gene variation is associated with  damage in children with NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic  disease in adults and children. Along with obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance, genetic factors strongly impact on NAFLD development and progression. Dysregulated bile acid metabolism and the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) pathway play a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis. However, it remains to be defined the mechanism through which the FGF19 receptor system is associated with  damage in NAFLD.We evaluated the impact of the rs17618244 G>A β-Klotho (KLB) variant on  damage in 249 pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and the association of this variant with the expression of hepatic and soluble KLB. In vitro models were established to investigate the role of KLB mutant.The KLB rs17618244 variant was associated with increased risk of ballooning and lobular inflammation. KLB plasma levels were lower in carriers of the rs17618244 minor A allele and were associated with lobular inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis. In HepG2 and Huh7 hepatoma cell lines, exposure to free  acids caused a severe reduction of intracellular and secreted KLB. Finally, KLB down-regulation obtained by the expression of KLB mutant in HepG2 and Huh7 cells induced intracellular lipid accumulation and up-regulation of p62, ACOX1, ACSL1, IL-1β and TNF-α gene expression.In conclusion, we showed an association between the rs17618244 KLB variant, which leads to reduced KLB expression, and the severity of NAFLD in pediatric patients. We can speculate that KLB protein may exert a protective role against lipotoxicity and inflammation in hepatocytes.Genetic and environmental factors strongly impact on NAFLD pathogenesis and progression. The FGF19/FGFR4/KLB pathway plays a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis, thus, it has been identified as a therapeutic target. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the impact of the KLB rs17618244 G>A genetic variant on  damage severity in pediatric patients with NAFLD, and the effect of KLB mutant on hepatocellular damage.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the .

Despite an increasing amount of people worldwide developing NAFLD and having it progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and potentially cirrhosis, there is still no approved therapy. Therefore, huge efforts are being made to find and develop a successful treatment. One of the special interests is understanding the -gut axis and especially the role of bile acids in the progression of NAFLD. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-agonists have been approved und used in other  diseases, such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and have shown signs of being able to decrease inflammation and potentially steatosis. This review will mainly focus on targets/ligands that play an important role in bile acid metabolism and give an overview of ongoing clinical as well as pre-clinical trials. With the complexity of the issue, we did not aim at giving a complete review, rather highlighting important targets and potential treatments that could be approved for NAFLD/NASH treatment within the next few years.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661889>Combined Exposure to Fructose and Bisphenol A Exacerbates Abnormal Lipid Metabolism in  of Developmental Male Rats.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether combined exposure to fructose and bisphenol A (BPA) has a synergistic effect on abnormal lipid metabolism in the  of developmental male rats and its possible mechanism. Fifty weaned male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: the control, 13% fructose, 20% fructose, 1 µg/mL BPA, and 13% fructose + 1 µg/mL BPA (combined exposure). Rats were exposed to fructose and/or BPA through drinking water for eight weeks. Genes or proteins regulating lipid metabolism include sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1),  acid synthase (FAS), zinc α 2 glycoprotein (ZAG) and estrogen receptor α (ERα), and the expression of proteins regulating inflammatory response, such as TLR4 and NF-κB, were determined. Serum total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), low, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, HDL-C), blood glucose, insulin, IL-17 and TNF-α levels were also measured.  tissue morphology was observed by H&E staining. The results showed that the levels of gene and protein catalyzing lipogenesis were increased (SREBP1, ACC1 and FAS), while those catalyzing lipolysis were decreased (ATGL, HSL and ZAG), accompanied by dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hepatic fat accumulation, and there were higher expression of TLR4 and NF-κB protein and lower expression of ERα protein in , and increased serum IL-17 and TNF-α levels in fructose and/or BPA exposed rats compared with controls. Moreover, the above indicators were more serious in combined exposure group than in single exposure group. Therefore, abnormal lipid metabolism in the  of developmental rats could be exacerbated by combined exposed to fructose and BPA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631714>Hepatocellular carcinoma in non-alcohol  disease - changing trends and specific challenges.</a></h2><p> Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary  cancer. The etiology of this disease is known in 90% of the patients, and it is viral in most of the cases. According to recent predictions, nearly half of the world population will be suffering from obesity by 2030. Consequently, non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) may play a growing role in HCC epidemiology. In this review we sought to explore the relationship between  steatosis and HCC.  A narrative review was conducted using the PubMed MeSH search. The eligible papers were identified using a standard PubMed search with relevant key terms and various synonyms.  According to the results, patients with NAFLD-HCC tended to be older than those with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-HCC, and they were more often obese and had concomitant diseases, such as diabetes. On the other hand, the synthetic  function was better preserved in NAFLD-HCC patients, who also obtained lower scores on the Model for End-stage  Disease (MELD) and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP). However, it has to be noted that HCC in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) may develop without underlying cirrhosis. Although NASH-HCC is usually smaller and well-differentiated compared to HCV-HCC, the prognosis is similar in both groups. Efficient HCC screening in NASH cirrhosis poses a challenge because it is difficult to perform ultrasound examination in obese patients and alfa-fetoprotein level is no longer considered reliable.  The constantly increasing prevalence of NAFLD in the general population can contribute to a growing role of NAFLD/NASH in HCC epidemiology. Moreover, some particular challenges specific for patients with  steatosis may impede proper HCC diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631098>Regulation of angiopoietin-like protein 8 expression under different nutritional and metabolic status.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease with increasing prevalence worldwide. Angiopoietin-like protein 8 (ANGPTL8), a member of the angiopoietin-like protein family, is involved in glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and energy homeostasis and believed to be associated with T2DM. Expression levels of ANGPTL8 are often significantly altered in metabolic diseases, such as non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and diabetes mellitus. Studies have shown that ANGPTL8, together with other members of this protein family, such as angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) and angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4), regulates the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), thereby participating in the regulation of triglyceride related lipoproteins (TRLs). In addition, members of the angiopoietin-like protein family are varyingly expressed among different tissues and respond differently under diverse nutritional and metabolic status. These findings may provide new options for the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes, metabolic syndromes and other diseases. In this review, the interaction between ANGPTL8 and ANGPTL3 or ANGPTL4, and the differential expression of ANGPTL8 responding to different nutritional and metabolic status during the regulation of LPL activity were reviewed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632963>Monitoring the Sphingolipid  Synthesis by Stable-Isotope Labeling and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Sphingolipids are a class of lipids that share a sphingoid base backbone. They exert various effects in eukaryotes, ranging from structural roles in plasma membranes to cellular signaling.  sphingolipid synthesis takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the condensation of the activated C  acid palmitoyl-CoA and the amino acid L-serine is catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). The product, 3-ketosphinganine, is then converted into more complex sphingolipids by additional ER-bound enzymes, resulting in the formation of ceramides. Since sphingolipid homeostasis is crucial to numerous cellular functions, improved assessment of sphingolipid metabolism will be key to better understanding several human diseases. To date, no assay exists capable of monitoring  synthesis sphingolipid in its entirety. Here, we have established a cell-free assay utilizing rat  microsomes containing all the enzymes necessary for bottom-up synthesis of ceramides. Following lipid extraction, we were able to track the different intermediates of the sphingolipid metabolism pathway, namely 3-ketosphinganine, sphinganine, dihydroceramide, and ceramide. This was achieved by chromatographic separation of sphingolipid metabolites followed by detection of their accurate mass and characteristic fragmentations through high-resolution mass spectrometry and tandem-mass spectrometry. We were able to distinguish, unequivocally, between  synthesized sphingolipids and intrinsic species, inevitably present in the microsome preparations, through the addition of stable isotope-labeled palmitate-d and L-serine-d. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a method monitoring the entirety of ER-associated sphingolipid biosynthesis. Proof-of-concept data was provided by modulating the levels of supplied cofactors (e.g., NADPH) or the addition of specific enzyme inhibitors (e.g., fumonisin B). The presented microsomal assay may serve as a useful tool for monitoring alterations in sphingolipid  synthesis in cells or tissues. Additionally, our methodology may be used for metabolism studies of atypical substrates - naturally occurring or chemically tailored - as well as novel inhibitors of enzymes involved in sphingolipid  synthesis.Copyright © 2019 Wigger, Gulbins, Kleuser and Schumacher.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665185>Correction: Nonalcoholic  disease is a risk factor for large-for-gestational-age birthweight.</a></h2><p>[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0221400.].</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659873>Muscle Insulin Resistance in Youth with Obesity and Normoglycemia is Associated with Altered Fat Metabolism.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to phenotype and compare adipose, hepatic, and muscle insulin sensitivity (IS) in a diet- and physical activity-controlled cohort of normoglycemic youth with obesity with that of participants without obesity (controls) to distinguish early metabolic abnormalities in pediatric obesity.Thirty-eight participants (17 in the control group [BMI < 85th percentile] and 21 youth with obesity [BMI ≥ 95th percentile]; age: 12-21 years; 76% female; Tanner stage 4-5; sedentary) were enrolled. Tissue-specific IS was measured using a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess suppression of endogenous glucose release and lipolysis by insulin. Intramyocellular lipid content was assessed by  H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hepatic fat fraction (HFF) and visceral fat were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with obesity had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral fat (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular lipid content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003). Mitochondria postexercise response was not different. In participants with obesity, muscle IS inversely correlated with HFF (r = 0.700, P = 0.002) and suppressed free  acid concentrations (r = -0.65, P = 0.003).Inactive normoglycemic youth with obesity had decreased muscle, adipose, and hepatic IS. Free  acids and  fat were inversely associated with muscle IS, which argues for lipid-targeted interventions.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675427>Effect of Metabolic Traits on the Risk of Cirrhosis and Hepatocellular Cancer in Non-alcoholic  Disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is now the most common  condition. Predicting its progression could help clinicians manage and potentially prevent complications. We evaluated the independent and joint effects of metabolic traits on the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients with NAFLD. We assembled a retrospective cohort of patients with NAFLD diagnosed at 130 facilities in the Veterans Administration between 1/1/2004 and 12/31/2008 with follow-up through 12/31/2015. We performed competing risk, adjusted cause-specific Cox models to evaluate the effects of metabolic traits (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity) as additive or combined indicators on time to develop cirrhosis or HCC or a composite endpoint of both. Of the 271,906 patients, 22,794 developed cirrhosis, and 253 developed HCC during a mean of 9 years follow up. At baseline, the mean BMI was 31.6 (SD, 5.6), 28.7% had diabetes, 70.3% hypertension, and 62.3% had dyslipidemia with substantial overlap among the these traits. The risk of progression was the lowest in patients with only one or no metabolic trait. There was a stepwise increase in risk with each additional metabolic trait. Compared to patients with no metabolic trait, patients with both hypertension and dyslipidemia had 1.8-fold higher risk of progression to cirrhosis/HCC (hazard ratio (HR) =1.8, 95% CI=1.59-2.06); the risk was 2.6-fold higher in patients with diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension (HR=2.6, 95% CI=2.3,2.9). These associations were stronger for HCC. Diabetes had the strongest association with HCC in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Each additional metabolic trait increased the risk of cirrhosis and HCC in patients with NAFLD. Diabetes conferred the highest risk of progression to HCC. Diabetic patients with co-existing hypertension and obesity may be important targets for secondary prevention.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of  Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641351>RAGE is a Potential Cause of Onset and Progression of Nonalcoholic  Disease.</a></h2><p> is a rising global health concern, significantly increasing the burden of health care cost. Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) has a correlation with metabolic syndrome and its complications.We reviewed the literature regarding the mechanisms of developing NAFLD through AGE-RAGE signaling.NAFLD, metabolic syndrome, and production of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) share many common risk factors and appear to be connected. AGE induces production of the receptor for AGE (RAGE). AGE-RAGE interaction contributes to fat accumulation in the  leading to inflammation, fibrosis, insulin resistance, and other complications of the  disease. The immune system, especially macrophages, has an important defense mechanism against RAGE pathway activities.Soluble form of RAGE (sRAGE) has the capability to reduce inflammation by blocking the interaction of AGE with RAGE. However, sRAGE has some limitations, and the best method of usage is probably autotransplantation of transfected stem cells or monocytes, as a precursor of macrophages and Kupffer cells, with a virus that carries sRAGE to alleviate the harmful effects of AGE-RAGE signaling in the settings of  disease.Copyright © 2019 Kamyar Asadipooya et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651803>Childhood Obesity: A Risk Factor for Non-alcoholic  Disease in Adolescence.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), defined as fat accumulation >5% in hepatocytes, may progress to fibrosis or cirrhosis later in life.

We investigated whether fibrosis identified by hepatic stiffness measurements based on magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) affects attenuation coefficient measurement using UGAP for the evaluation of hepatic steatosis.A total of 608 patients with chronic  disease were analyzed. Correlations between magnetic resonance imaging-determined proton density fat fraction (PDFF) or MRE value and attenuation coefficients were evaluated. In addition, the interaction between hepatic fibrosis and attenuation coefficient was analyzed.The correlation coefficient (r) between PDFF values and attenuation coefficient values was 0.724, indicating a strong relationship. Conversely, the r between MRE values and attenuation coefficient values was -0.187, indicating almost no relationship. In the multiple regression assessment of the effect of PDFF and MRE on attenuation coefficient based on UGAP, the p values for PDFF, MRE, and PDFF×MRE were <0.001, 0.277, and 0.903, respectively. In patients with non-alcoholic  disease (n=169), the r between PDFF values and attenuation coefficient values was 0.695, indicating a moderate relationship. Conversely, the r between MRE values and attenuation coefficient values was -0.068, indicating almost no relationship. In the multiple regression assessment of the effect of PDFF and MRE on attenuation coefficient based on UGAP, the p values for PDFF, MRE, and PDFF×MRE were <0.001, 0.948, and 0.706, respectively.UGAP-determined attenuation coefficient was weakly affected by  stiffness, an indicator of hepatic fibrosis.This article is protected by copyright.

Serum cathepsin D levels were measured using the CatD enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (USCN Life Science, Wuhan, China) using stored samples collected on the same day of the  biopsy procedure. The performance of cathepsin D in the diagnosis and monitoring of NASH was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic analysis.Data for 216  biopsies and 34 healthy controls were analyzed. The mean cathepsin D level was not significantly different between NAFLD patients and controls; between NASH and non-NASH patients; and across the different steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning grades. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of cathepsin D for the diagnosis of NAFLD and NASH was 0.62 and 0.52, respectively. The AUROC of cathepsin D for the diagnosis of the different steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning grades ranged from 0.51 to 0.58. Of the 216  biopsies, 152 were paired  biopsies from 76 patients who had a repeat  biopsy after 48 weeks. There was no significant change in the cathepsin D level at follow-up compared to baseline in patients who had histological improvement or worsening for steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning grades. Cathepsin D was poor for predicting improvement or worsening of steatosis and hepatocyte ballooning, with AUROC ranging from 0.47 to 0.54. It was fair for predicting worsening (AUROC 0.73) but poor for predicting improvement (AUROC 0.54) of lobular inflammation.Cathepsin D was a poor biomarker for the diagnosis and monitoring of NASH in our cohort of Asian patients, somewhat inconsistent with previous observations in Caucasian patients.

In this review, the beneficial effects of pterostilbene on diabetes,  steatosis and dyslipidemia are summarized. Pterostilbene is a useful bioactive compound in preventing type 1 diabetes, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in animal models. Concerning type 1 diabetes, the main mechanisms described to justify the positive effects of this phenolic compound are increased  glycogen content and hepatic glucokinase and phosphofructokinase activities, the recovery of pancreatic islet architecture, cytoprotection and a decrease in serum and pancreatic pro-inflammatory cytokines. As for type 2 diabetes, increased  glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase and decreased fructose-1,6-biphosphatase activities are reported. When insulin resistance is induced by diets, a greater activation of insulin signaling cascade has been reported, increased cardiotrophin-1 levels and  glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activities, and a decreased fructose-1,6-biphosphatase activity. Data concerning pterostilbene and  steatosis are scarce so far, but the reduction in oxidative stress induced by pterostilbene may be involved since oxidative stress is related to the progression of steatosis to steatohepatitis. Finally, pterostilbene effectivelly reduces total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels, while increases HDL-cholesterol in animal models of dyslipidemia.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653569>Comment on: impact of a preoperative low-calorie diet on  histology in patients with  disease undergoing bariatric surgery.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641780>Determination of the Polychlorinated Biphenyls Distribution in Different Fat Tissues of Cattle by Age and Gender.</a></h2><p>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which cause environmental pollution, are found in animal-based  foods. Due to their long half-life and lipophilic properties, they can accumulate in the fat tissues of cattle. The study was conducted to compare the PCB levels (PCB28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, and 180) in the different fat tissues (muscle, , kidney, spinal cord, lung, back fat, perihepatic fat, and perirenal fat) of cattle by age and gender. This information is also useful to evaluate the exposure risks for different bovine edible tissues. Therefore, 15 female and 15 male cattle under 24 months of age and 15 female and 15 male cattle over 24 months of age were used, and 480 samples were analyzed for target PCBs using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Of all the samples, two (50.2 µg/kg in perihepatic fat and 51.1 µg/kg in kidney) were found above the maximum residue limit; these samples were taken from the animals in the elderly female group (over 24 months). There were more PCBs in cattle older than 2 years. Muscle, kidney, and perihepatic fat presented higher PCB concentrations than other tissues, and perirenal fat presented lower PCB concentrations than other tissues. PCB101, PCB153, and PCB138 were found to have the highest contribution to the PCB concentration. Thus, it is concluded that perihepatic fat, muscle, or kidney should be sampled, particularly in routine residue monitoring, and specifically analyzed for PCB101, PCB153, and PCB138.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629366>Non-alcoholic  disease in adults: Current concepts in etiology, outcomes and management.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of disease, extending from simple steatosis, through to inflammation and fibrosis with a significant risk for the development of cirrhosis. It is highly prevalent and is associated with significant adverse outcomes both through -specific morbidity and mortality, but perhaps more importantly, through adverse cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes. It is tightly associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity and both of these conditions drive progressive disease towards the more advanced stages. The mechanisms that govern hepatic lipid accumulation and the predisposition to inflammation and fibrosis are still not fully understood, but reflect a complex interplay between metabolic target tissues including adipose and skeletal muscle, and immune and inflammatory cells.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress have been recognized as key mechanisms in non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis. Whether Orai1 facilitates ER stress by oxidative stress remains unknown. The rat model of NAFLD was constructed by feeding high-fat diet (HFD). BRL-3A cells were treated with NEFAs, Orai1inhibtor BTP2, NFκB inhibitor wogonin, or small interfering Orai (siOrai) 1, respectively. The content of intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA), indicating oxidative stress, was measured by a spectrophotometer. ER stress major proteins PERK, IRE1, ATF6, CHOP, and GRP78 were quantified using Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses. For the intracellular location of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Orai1 were measured by Western blot and immunofluorescence, and cytosolic Ca was measured by flow cytometry. As we expected, the  of rats with NAFLD showed lipid droplets in HE and Oil Red O. The decreased GSH and increased MDA were found in rats fed with HFD. ER stress major proteins PERK, IRE1, ATF6, GRP78, and CHOP were significantly increased in the HFD group. In BRL-3A cells, GSH content dramatically decreased from 1 h, MDA content dramatically increased from 3 h, and expression levels of ER stress significantly increased from 3 h by NEFA treatment. Furthermore, cytosolic Ca increased from 0.5 h by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells. It indicated that NEFAs increased cytosolic Ca to induce oxidative stress, thus ER stress. The content of oxidative stress and ER stress proteins showed the same trends by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells. These effects were reversed by the Orai1 inhibitor BTP2 and the NFκB inhibitor wogonin. Moreover, siOrai1 abrogated NEFAs' influence in BRL-3A cells. Last, ROS was found by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells, and NEFA treatment enhanced the nuclear localization of NF-κB p65 and ORAI1. It was considered that high NEFAs increased cytosolic Ca and enhanced NFκB-dependent SOCE and its moiety protein Orai1 to decrease GSH and thus induced oxidative stress at earlier stages and furthermore tempted ER stress in the pathologic progress of NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Li, Zou, Guo, Zhang, Xia, Zhang, Yang and Xu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628911>Association between the perturbation of bile acid homeostasis and valproic acid-induced hepatotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Valproic acid (VPA), a widely prescribed antiepileptic drug, is known to induce hepatotoxicity. However, the mechanisms underlying this toxicity are not well understood. In this study, we performed a nontargeted metabolomic analysis of children with epilepsy treated with VPA (n = 23). Metabolic pathway analysis showed that the  acid pathway, citrate cycle, urea cycle, amino acid metabolism, and bile acid pathway were altered in children with epilepsy exhibiting VPA hepatotoxicity. In particular, the VPA-induced perturbation of bile acid homeostasis has not been observed previously. Based on these findings, we performed a targeted metabolomic analysis to characterize bile acid profiles and further determined the effects of VPA on the synthesis, transport, and regulation of bile acids in mice. The bile acid metabolomic profiles of the livers of mice treated with VPA indicated an increase in most bile acids, especially chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and deoxycholic acid (DCA), as well as unconjugated bile acids. The upregulation of genes related to bile acid synthesis (CYP7A1 and CYP8B1) and the downregulation of genes related to conjugation (BAAT and BACS) and regulation (FXR and SHP) were detected in the , suggesting that hydrophobic bile acid production was increased and FXR signaling was impaired. Our results suggest that the perturbation of bile acid homeostasis and impaired FXR signaling are involved in VPA-induced hepatotoxicity, providing a novel insight into VPA hepatotoxicity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The genome of HCC exhibits diverse mutational signatures, resulting in recurrent mutations across more than 30 cancer genes. Stem cells from normal livers have a low mutational burden and limited diversity of signatures, which suggests that the complexity of HCC arises during the progression to chronic  disease and subsequent malignant transformation. Here, by sequencing whole genomes of 482 microdissections of 100-500 hepatocytes from 5 normal and 9 cirrhotic livers, we show that cirrhotic  has a higher mutational burden than normal . Although rare in normal hepatocytes, structural variants, including chromothripsis, were prominent in cirrhosis. Driver mutations, such as point mutations and structural variants, affected 1-5% of clones. Clonal expansions of millimetres in diameter occurred in cirrhosis, with clones sequestered by the bands of fibrosis that surround regenerative nodules. Some mutational signatures were universal and equally active in both non-malignant hepatocytes and HCCs; some were substantially more active in HCCs than chronic  disease; and others-arising from exogenous exposures-were present in a subset of patients. The activity of exogenous signatures between adjacent cirrhotic nodules varied by up to tenfold within each patient, as a result of clone-specific and microenvironmental forces. Synchronous HCCs exhibited the same mutational signatures as background cirrhotic , but with higher burden. Somatic mutations chronicle the exposures, toxicity, regeneration and clonal structure of  tissue as it progresses from health to disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634861>HIV and the .</a></h2><p>Among individuals with HIV infection,  disease remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality, even with the availability of agents that cure hepatitis C infection and suppress hepatitis B replication.

In 2013, a new  transplant program was established at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. Here, we describe our experience with the first 150 transplants over a 4.5-year period. This study is a review of 147 patients who underwent the first 150  transplants at the University of Mississippi Medical Center between March 5, 2013, and January 4, 2018. There were no exclusion criteria for this study. Donor, recipient, and outcome variables were analyzed. Recipients were 46% female and 74% white. Age at the time of transplant was 57 [IQR 49-63]. BMI at transplant was 30 [IQR 25-35]. Thirty per cent of transplants were for alcoholic cirrhosis, 25% non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, 24% hepatitis C, and 12% cholestatic. Mean model for end-stage  disease (MELD) at the time of transplant was 20 [95% confidence interval 19-21] and MELD-Na was 22 [95% confidence interval 20-23]. One-year patient- and graft survival were 89% and 87%, respectively, which were as expected based on Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient reports after risk adjustment.

Recent studies suggest that patients with HIV are at high risk for nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and progressive  fibrosis. Evidence for the prevalence, risk factors, and diagnostic methodologies of NAFLD in patients with HIV mono-infection is summarized here.Although limited, published studies suggest that the prevalence of NAFLD is higher (30-50%) and progresses at an increased rate in patients with HIV compared to the general population. Identifying those at risk for significant  fibrosis is critical, preferably with non-invasive screening tests. While there is a paucity of evidence in this population, transient elastography (TE) appears to provide a sensitive, non-invasive screening modality. Identifying NAFLD early will allow for dietary and lifestyle interventions, as well as future drug therapies to decrease the risk of progressive  fibrosis and cirrhosis in the high-risk HIV population.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the significance of miR-1296 as a non-invasive biomarker in nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD).Serum samples were collected from normal people and NAFLD patients for biochemical detection. Serum microRNAs were isolated by the NucleoZOL method, and the stem-loop method was used to reverse transcribe the DNA. The relative quantification of miR-1296 was performed by SYBR Green method. Spearman's method was used to analyze the correlation between miR-1296 and serum biochemical parameters.By using 2-∆∆CT method, we found that, compared with the normal control group, the expression of serum miR-1296 increased in patients with normal lipid NAFLD and those with hyperlipidemia NAFLD. At the same time, the expression of microRNA-1296 in the NAFLD hyperlipidemia group increased more significantly than that in the NFALD group with normal lipid. Spearman's correlation assay demonstrated that the correlation between the expression of miR-1296 and blood lipids, including TC, TG, HDL-c, and LDL-c, was TC (r = 0.4951, p = 0.0013), TG (r = 0.054, p = 0.6425), HDL-C (r = 0.3435, p = 0.07522), and LDL-C (r = 0.3307, p = 0.0699. The data showed that miR-1296 was positively correlated with serum TC level.In summary, serum microRNA-1296 is a more sensitive marker of NAFLD than blood lipids, which provides a new method for noninvasive early screening of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666474>The Effects of BCAAs on Insulin Resistance in Athletes.</a></h2><p>The toxic catabolic intermediates of branched chain amino acids can cause insulin resistance, and are involved in different mechanisms in different metabolic tissues. In skeletal muscle, 3-hydroxy-isobutyrate produced by valine promotes skeletal muscle  acid uptake, resulting in the accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipids in skeletal muscle, causing skeletal muscle insulin resistance. In the , branched-chain α-keto acids decompose in large amounts, promote hepatic gluconeogenesis, and lead to the accumulation of multiple acylcarnitines, which damages the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle, resulting in the accumulation of incomplete oxidation products, oxidative stress in mitochondria, and hepatic insulin resistance. In adipose tissue, the expression of branched-chain amino acid catabolic enzymes (branched-chain amino acid transaminase, branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase) is reduced, resulting in an increased level of plasma branched-chain amino acids, thereby causing massive decomposition of branched-chain amino acids in tissues such as skeletal muscle and , and inducing insulin resistance. However, branched-chain amino acids, as a common nutritional supplement for athletes, do not induce insulin resistance. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that exercise can enhance the mitochondrial oxidative potential of branched-chain amino acids, alleviate or even eliminate the accumulation of branched-chain amino acid catabolic intermediates, and promotes branched-chain amino acids catabolism into beta-aminoisobutyric acid, increasing plasma beta-aminoisobutyric acid concentration, improving insulin resistance. This article reveals the mechanism of BCAA-induced insulin resistance and the relationship between exercise and BCAAs metabolism, adds a guarantee for the use of BCAAs, and provides a new explanation for the occurrence of diabetes and how exercise improves diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673045>Hepatic Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 deficiency-mediated activation of mTORC1- PGC-1α axis regulates ER stress during high-carbohydrate feeding.</a></h2><p>Stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is a key enzyme in lipogenesis as it catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated  acids (MUFAs), mainly oleate (18:1n9) and palmitoleate (16:1n7) from saturated  acids (SFA), stearate (18:0) and palmitate (16:0), respectively. Studies on SCD1 deficiency in mouse models demonstrated beneficial metabolic phenotypes such as reduced adiposity and improved glucose tolerance. Even though, SCD1 represents a potential target to resolve obesity related metabolic diseases; SCD1 deficiency causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activates unfolded protein response (UPR). The induction of ER stress in response to SCD1 deficiency is governed by the cofactor, PGC-1α. However, the mechanism by which SCD1 deficiency increases PGC-1α and subsequently induces ER stress still remains elusive. The present study demonstrates that despite reduced lipogenesis,  specific SCD1 deficiency activates the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) along with induction of PGC-1α and ER stress. Further, mTORC1 inhibition attenuates SCD1 deficiency-mediated induction of both PGC-1α and ER stress. Similar observations were seen by restoring endogenously synthesized oleate, but not palmitoleate, suggesting a clear mTORC1-mediated regulation of ER stress during SCD1 deficiency. Overall, our results suggest a model whereby maintaining adequate levels of hepatic oleate is required to suppress mTORC1-mediated ER stress. In addition, the activation of mTORC1 by SCD1 deficiency reveals an important function of  acids in regulating different cellular processes through mTORC1 signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659451>Anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047 on high-fat and high-fructose diet mice base on inflammatory response alleviation and gut microbiota regulation.</a></h2><p>The objective of the study was to evaluate the anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047, and illustrate the potential functional mechanism about the alleviation of high fat and high fructose diet (HFFD) induced obesity and related metabolic abnormalities.C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a standard or HFFD with or without supplementation of L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 for 10 weeks. Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid,  function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in  and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain  acids (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658997>Inflammation triggers  X receptor-dependent lipogenesis.</a></h2><p>Immune cell function can be modulated by changes in lipid metabolism. Our studies indicate that cholesterol and  acid synthesis increases in macrophages between 12 and 18 hours after the activation of toll-like receptors with pro-inflammatory stimuli and that up-regulation of lipogenesis may contribute to the resolution of inflammation. The inflammation-dependent increase in lipogenesis requires induction of the  X receptors, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors, by type I interferons in response to inflammatory signals. Instead of the well-established role for  X receptors in stimulating cholesterol efflux, we demonstrate that  X receptors are necessary for the proper resumption of cholesterol synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Thus,  X receptors function as bidirectional regulators of cholesterol homeostasis driving efflux when cholesterol levels are high and facilitating synthesis in response to inflammatory signals.  X receptor activity is also required for the proper shutdown of a subset of type I interferon-stimulated genes as inflammation subsides, placing the receptors in a negative feedback loop that may contribute to resolution of the inflammatory response.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648561>KLF15-activating Twist2 ameliorated hepatic steatosis by inhibiting inflammation and improving mitochondrial dysfunction  NF-κB-FGF21 or SREBP1c-FGF21 pathway.</a></h2><p>Twist-related protein 2 (TWIST2) is identified as a basic helix-loop-helix (b-HLH) transcription repressor by dimerizing with other b-HLH proteins. The significance of TWIST2 has been emphasized in various tumors; however, few studies report its functions in metabolism and metabolic diseases. Here we aimed to explore the novel role and regulation mechanism of TWIST2 in hepatic steatosis. Our results showed that  knockdown caused mice obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis, which were accompanied with inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. , TWIST2 overexpression ameliorated hepatocellular steatosis, inhibited inflammation, and improved mitochondrial content and function with a fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21)-dependent pattern. NF-κB negatively regulated FGF21 transcription by directly binding to  promoter DNA, which was eliminated by TWIST2 overexpression by inhibiting NF-κB expression and translocation to nucleus. TWIST2 overexpression decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species level, increased mitochondrial DNA and biogenesis, and enhanced ATP production and antioxidation ability. Additionally, TWIST2 expression was repressed by insulin-targeting sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and forkhead box protein O1 and was enhanced by dexamethasone targeting Krüppel-like factor 15, which directly interacted with  promoter DNA.

It is mainly produced by recombinant microorganisms (Candida famata, Bacillus subtilis and Ashbya gossypii). The availability of genetically modified organism (GMO)-free riboflavin, obligatory in European organic agriculture, is a major issue. Besides, requirements for organic livestock might differ from conventional production because other genotypes and feed formulations are used. The effects of a fermentation suspension with a high native content of riboflavin produced with unmodified A. gossypii by fermentation were investigated at graded dosages as an alternative to conventional (GMO-based) riboflavin in slow-growing broilers on performance traits and health and welfare indicators. In 2 runs with 800 animals each, Ranger Gold™ broilers were fed with 4 dietary treatments. For starter diets (day 1 to 18), treatments included a basal diet (1) without any riboflavin supplementation (negative control, N-C), (2) with conventional riboflavin supplementation (Cuxavit B2 80% riboflavin) at 9.6 mg/kg (positive control, P-C), (3) with riboflavin supplementation from the alternative source at 3.5 mg/kg (A-low) and (4) with riboflavin supplementation from the alternative source at 9.6 mg/kg (A-high). For the finisher diet (day 29 until slaughtering), P-C and A-high were supplemented with 8.0 mg/kg and A-low with 3.5 mg/kg. Diets were formulated according to organic regulations. Animals were kept in floor pens with 20 chickens per pen. Weekly, BW, feed and water consumption were recorded. Every second week, animal-based health and welfare indicators (feather score and footpad dermatitis) were scored. Slaughter traits were assessed for five males and females per pen at 62/63 days of age. Final body weight of A-high differed from N-C and A-low, but not from P-C. From week 2 until six years of age, A-high had a higher daily weight gain when compared to all other groups. With 74.4%, dressing percentage was higher in A-high compared with all other groups (73.3%). Breast percentage of A-low was lower than that of both control groups but did not differ from A-high. The highest frequency of  scores indicating  syndrome was found in P-C, followed by N-C and A-low. Feather scores did not respond to treatment; the highest frequency of mild footpad dermatitis was observed in A-high, however at a low prevalence. In conclusion, the tested fermentation suspension with a high native content of riboflavin derived from fermentation of A. gossypii can be used at levels of commercial recommendations as alternative to riboflavin produced from GMO in broiler feeding. Further studies must verify whether riboflavin can be reduced without inducing riboflavin deficiency in slow-growing broilers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657737>Effect of the dietary linoleic/α-linolenic ratio (n6/n3) on histopathological alterations caused by suboptimal temperature in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus).</a></h2><p>Tilapias are produced worldwide, including subtropical areas. In turn, dietary  acids can enhance resistance under cold stress. The present study reports the nutritional effect on suboptimal temperature tolerance based on histopathological alterations in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Fish (initial weight: 34.02 ± 0.79) were exposed to two different temperatures (20 °C and 30 °C) for 30 days. Under both conditions, fish were fed two different diets based on the linoleic/α-linolenic ratio (n6/n3 = 12.02 and n6/n3 = 3.85). The most important alterations in  caused by temperature included high cellular hyperplasia in fish at 30 °C (P < 0.05). Suboptimal temperature also caused gills aneurysm, lamellar lifting and low hyperplasia (P < 0.05). Cytoplasmic vacuolization decreased and nuclear displacement increased in the fish fed n6/n3 = 3.85 (P < 0.05). Suboptimal temperature provided high gills aneurysm, epithelial lamellae lifting and low lamellar hyperplasia (P < 0.05). Conversely, the  acid content (n6/n3 = 3.85) in the diet provided low lamellar lifting and fusions (P < 0.05). Finally, tilapia showed an increased glycogen storage trend in gills and muscle at low temperature (P < 0.05). Our study suggests that when feeding tilapia a high dietary n3 content, this fish is able to respond to suboptimal temperature in subtropical aquaculture facilities.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, data regarding stroke risk are limited. We sought to investigate whether NAFLD-fibrosis is associated with stroke in addition to heart disease.We performed a cross-sectional study using data from the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005-2014). After excluding participants with competing causes of  disease, the Fibrosis-4 score (FIB-4) and NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) were calculated. First, we used a composite measure to classify participants: NAFLD-fibrosis was defined as having at least one score above its validated cut-off. Second, we also used the FIB-4 and NFS scores individually. The key outcome was prevalent stroke, and we also evaluated heart disease; both were self-reported. Multivariable logistic regression assessed the association between NAFLD-fibrosis and these outcomes while adjusting for demographic variables and cardiovascular risk factors.We identified 1653 participants with NAFLD-fibrosis from a sample of 27,040 participants. In total, 753 had prior stroke. An association between NAFLD-fibrosis and stroke was seen when using the FIB-4 score (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.00-3.50) but not the NFS (OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.92-1.87). NAFLD-fibrosis was associated with heart disease (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.06-2.01) using the composite measure and both scores individually.NAFLD-fibrosis may be associated with stroke in addition to heart disease, with differences depending on the measure used to define NAFLD-fibrosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we aimed to explore whether inhibition of ceramide signaling by myriocin is beneficial in animal model of NAFLD via regulating autophagy.Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: standard chow (n = 10), high-fat diet (HFD) (n = 10) or HFD combined with oral administration of myriocin (0.3 mg/kg on alternate days for 8 weeks) (n = 10).  histology and autophagy function were measured. HepG2 cells were incubated with  acid with or without myriocin treatment. Lipid accumulation and autophagy markers in the HepG2 cells were analyzed. Serum ceramide changes were studied in 104 subjects consisting healthy adults,  biopsy-proven patients with NAFLD and  biopsy-proven patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Myriocin reversed the elevated body weight and serum transaminases and alleviated dyslipidemia in HFD fed rats. Myriocin treatment significantly attenuated  pathology including steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning. By qPCR analysis, it was revealed that myriocin corrected the expression pattern of  acid metabolism associated genes including Fabp1, Pparα, Cpt-1α and Acox-2. Further, myriocin also restored the impaired hepatic autophagy function in rats with HFD-induced NASH, and this has been verified in HepG2 cells. Among the sphingolipid species that we screened in lipidomic profiles, significantly increased ceramide was observed in NASH patients as compared to the controls and non-NASH patients, regardless of whether or not they have active CHB.Ceramide may play an important regulatory role in the autophagy function in the pathogenesis of NASH. Hence, blockade of ceramide signaling by myriocin may be of therapeutically beneficial in NASH.Registration ID: ChiCTR-DDT-13003983 .

Silybin (Sil), a naturally occurring hepatoprotective agent, was widely used for treating NAFLD. Whether Sil effects gut microbiota during its actions in treating NAFLD, which is unknown. We aimed to examine the effect of Sil on intestinal flora dysbiosis induced by high-fat diet (HFD).After 10 weeks of feeding normal chow diet (NCD) or HFD, mice were given daily by gavage for 8 weeks. Cecal contents were harvested for study of short chain  acids (SCFAs), bile acids and gut microbiota alteration.Sil showed protective effects against dietary-induced obesity and  steatosis, accordingly gut microbiota composition changed. At phylum level, compared with HFD group, mice in the Sil-treated group had significant lower level of Firmicutes and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (P<0.05). At genus level, Sil-treated group have significant lower level of Lachnoclostridium, Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006 and Mollicutes_RF9, which were reported to be potentially related to diet-induced obesity, and increased levels of Blautia (P<0.05), Akkermansia (P<0.05), Bacteroides(P<0.05) which were known to have beneficial effect on improving NAFLD. Sil also showed inhibitory effect on well-known beneficial bacteria, such as Alloprevotella, Lactobacillus. Moreover, production of acetate, propionate and butyrate increased, while generation of formate and conversion of cytotoxic secondary metabolites (LCA, DCA) decreased in mice treated with Sil.Sil might have beneficial effects on ameliorating NAFLD and mediate HFD-induced change of gut microbiota composition, followed with major changes in secondary metabolites, such as SCFAs and BAs.This article is protected by copyright.

SCFAs are known to improve host metabolism but their underlying mechanism of action remains elusive. In this study, sixteen growing pigs were infused with saline or sodium propionate solution (25 mL, 2 mol/L), respectively through a cecal fistula twice a day during a 28 days experimental period. The results showed that the cecal infusion of the SCFA propionate decreased serum and  triglyceride levels, and increased serum PYY secretion in growing pigs. Hepatic metabolomics identified 12 metabolites that were significantly altered by propionate. These included decreased levels of lipid metabolism related stearic acid and glycerol-2-phosphate; increased levels of TCA cycle components including malic acid, fructose-6-phosphate, and succinic acid; and decreased levels of the amino acid metabolism products aspartic acid and serine. Hepatic transcriptomics demonstrated that propionate inhibited  acid synthesis and promoted lipid metabolic process. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that propionate accelerated gluconeogenesis and decreased glycolysis. Taken together, these data support a role of the SCFA propionate on host lipid and glucose metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652711>Ubiquinol Supplementation Alters Exercise Induced Fatigue by Increasing Lipid Utilization in Mice.</a></h2><p>Ubiquinol (QH), a reduced form of coenzyme Q10, is a lipid antioxidant that is hydro-soluble and is commonly formulated in commercial supplements. Ubiquinol has been increasingly reported to exert antioxidant functions, in addition to its role in the cell energy-producing system of mitochondria and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. The aim of this study was to assess the potential beneficial effects of QH on anti-fatigue and ergogenic functions following physiological challenge. Forty 8-week-old male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were divided into four groups ( = 10 for each group): Group 1 (vehicle control or oil only); Group 2 (1X QH dose or 102.5 mg/kg); Group 3 (2X QH dose or 205 mg/kg); Group 4 (6X QH dose or 615 mg/kg). Anti-fatigue activity and exercise performance were studied using the forelimb grip strength experiment and exhaustive weight-loaded swimming time, and levels of serum lactate, ammonia, glucose, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), creatine kinase (CK), and free  acids (FFA) after an acute exercise challenge. The forelimb grip strength and exhaustive weight-loaded swimming time of the QH-6X group were significantly higher than those of the other groups. QH supplementation dose-dependently reduced serum lactate, ammonia, and CK levels and increased the FFA concentration after acute exercise. In addition, QH increased the  and muscle glycogen content, an important energy source during exercise. Therefore, the results suggest that QH formulation is a safe dietary supplement for amelioration of fatigue and for promoting exercise performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656991>Adiponectin and PPAR: a setup for intricate crosstalk between obesity and non-alcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>Adiponectin, a soluble adipocytokine, plays an important role in the functioning of adipose tissue and in the regulation of inflammation, particularly hepatic inflammation.

The ultrasound  indicator (US-FLI) evaluates ultrasound (US) features to identify stages of  disease. We hypothesized that US features could be independent predictors of NASH and that the US-FLI differentiates steatosis from NASH in the average obese population.A retrospective analysis of 208 patients with normal (n = 14), steatotic (n = 89), and NASH (n = 105) livers was performed. /biliary disease and a history of alcohol intake were excluded. Ultrasound metrics included -kidney contrast, posterior attenuation, vessel blurring, difficulty visualizing the gallbladder wall, difficulty visualizing the diaphragm, and areas of focal  sparing. A statistical comparison of the 3 groups as well as fibrosis stage I and II/III NASH groups was performed. Logistic regression identified independent predictors of NASH.Gallbladder wall visualization and vessel blurring were different between the steatosis and NASH groups (P ≤ .01). Gallbladder wall visualization was specific for NASH (89%), and vessel blurring was sensitive for NASH (93%). A US-FLI score of 4 or lower suggested the absence of NASH (negative predictive value, 88%; sensitivity, 91%). Logistic regression revealed vessel blurring as the only US predictor of NASH (P ≤ .01). However, the area under the curve (0.649) showed poor performance in differentiating steatosis from NASH when the US-FLI score was 5 or higher.Our data suggest that the US-FLI may differentiate steatosis from NASH in the average obese population. Vessel blurring and poor gallbladder wall visualization were the most important metrics. Identification of NASH was enhanced by including the US-FLI score with vessel blurring.Published 2019.

NAFLD management is mainly focused on weight loss, but the optimal characteristics of the diet demand further investigation. This study aims to evaluate the effects of two personalized energy-restricted diets on the  status in overweight or obese subjects with NAFLD after a 6 months follow-up. Ninety-eight individuals from the  in Obesity (FLiO) study were randomized into two groups and followed different energy-restricted diets. Subjects were evaluated at baseline and after 6 months. Diet, anthropometry, body composition, and biochemical parameters were evaluated.  assessment included ultrasonography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, elastography, and determination of transaminases. Both dietary groups significantly improved their metabolic and hepatic markers after the intervention, with no significant differences between them. Multivariate regression models evidenced a relationship between weight loss, adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet), and a decrease in  fat content, predicting up to 40.9% of its variability after 6 months. Moreover, the antioxidant capacity of the diet was inversely associated with  fat content. Participants in the group with a higher adherence to the MedDiet showed a greater reduction in body weight, total fat mass, and hepatic fat. These results support the benefit of energy-restricted diets, high adherence to the MedDiet, and high antioxidant capacity of the diet for the management of NAFLD in individuals with overweight or obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639589>Early life high-fat diet exposure maintains glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity with a  and small brain size in the adult offspring.</a></h2><p>Diet during pregnancy has long lasting consequences on the offspring, warranting a study on the impact of early exposure to a high fat diet on the adult offspring. We hypothesized that a prenatal n-6 enriched diet will have adverse metabolic outcomes on the adult offspring that may be reversed with a postnatal n-3 enriched diet. To test this hypothesis, we examined the adult offspring from three groups: (1) n-6 group: during gestation and lactation, dams consumed an n-6 polyunsaturated  acid enriched diet, (2) n-3 group: gestational n-6 diet was followed by an n-3 enriched diet during lactation, and (3) a control (CD) group that received standard diet throughout gestation and lactation. Offspring from all groups weaned to a control diet ad libitum. Beginning at postnatal day 2 (P < .03) and persisting at 360 days in males (P < .04), an increase in hypothalamic AgRP expression occurred in the n-6 and n-3 groups, with an increase in food intake (P = .01), and the n-3 group displaying lower body (P < .03) and brain (P < .05) weights. At 360 days, the n-6 and n-3 groups remained glucose tolerant and insulin sensitive, with increased phosphorylated-AMP-activated protein kinase (P < .05). n-6 group developed hepatic steatosis with reduced hepatic reflected as higher plasma microRNA-122 (P < .04) that targets pAMPK. We conclude that early life exposure to n-6 and n-3 led to hypothalamic AgRP-related higher food intake, with n-6 culminating in a  partially mitigated by postnatal n-3. While both diets preserved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, postnatal n-3 displayed detrimental effects on the brain.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668088>Evaluation of sucrose-enriched diet consumption in the development of risk factors associated to type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis and non-alcoholic  disease in a murine model.</a></h2><p>Overconsumption of sucrose, the main contributor of the total added sugar intake in the world, has been associated with negative metabolic effects related to non-communicable diseases.

This class of drugs is used for the treatment of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Fenofibrate is one of the members of this class of synthetic PPARα receptor ligands. The oral administration of 0.3% fenofibrate caused a decrease in strength due to loss of body weight in laboratory animals when improving behavioural features. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of  cells showed a genotoxic effect of fenofibrate, due to accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which could be attributed to activation of peroxisomal β-oxidation processes, as well as to the lack of increase in the expression of genes encoding antioxidant defense proteins. Treatment with fenofibrate did not cause brain mtDNA damage. It has been shown that fenofibrate induced mitochondrial β-oxidation in the brain, as indicated by the increased expression of the Acadm and Cpt1a and Ppargc1a and Ppara.

There is an intriguing link between alopecia areata and gut dysbiosis. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been recommended to treat  (previously known as ) infection, and has also shown potentials in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and non-alcohol  disease.An 86-year-old man, with a history of sigmoid colon carcinoma, suffered from recurrent abdominal pain and distension, and diarrhea for six months, with inappetence. At admission, he was also diagnosed with depression. Upon physical examination, the patient presented with a 1.5 cm × 2.0 cm alopecia areata on his right occiput. Due to the negative results of laboratory testing, capsule endoscopy, and colonoscopy, the patient was diagnosed with noninfectious diarrhea, depressive disorder, and patchy alopecia areata. Considering that noninfectious diarrhea in the elderly patient was mainly caused by gut dysbiosis, he was given six rounds of FMT. His diarrhea improved remarkably one month after FMT, with improved appetite and disappearance of abdominal pain, distension, and depressive symptoms. Surprisingly, he reported new hair growth on the affected region of his scalp, with some of his white hair gradually turning to black, without taking any other therapies for alopecia areata before and after FMT.FMT might act as a potential therapy for patients who suffer from alopecia areata.

The pre-diabetic rats were then treated with OA (80 mg/kg) or metformin (500 mg/kg) in the presence and absence of dietary interventions for a period of 12 weeks. The effects of OA were evaluated on parameters including plasma triglycerides (TGs), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, bilirubin, AST, ALT, SREBP and antioxidant profile while the livers were collected for histological analysis.The findings of this study showed that the administration of OA to pre-diabetic rats ameliorated body/ weights ratio and significantly decreased plasma triglycerides (TGs) and VLDL. Furthermore, OA also ameliorated hepatic oxidative stress, lowered the SREBP expression and intrahepatic TGs. In addition, OA administration decreased plasma concentrations of bilirubin and  damage enzyme biomarkers.The findings of the study suggest that OA ameliorates the risk of developing pre-diabetes-related NAFLD through the prevention of intrahepatic fat accumulation while also lowering hepatic inflammation.© 2019 Gamede et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646850>Non alcoholic  disease: a survey of involvement of primary care physician.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are neglected in most patients' electrical medical report by their family physicians (FP).

Increased Nogo-B expression can be determined in the  of cirrhosis patients. However, the effect of PPARγ activation on hepatic Nogo-B expression remains unknown. In this study, we found PPARγ activation by rosiglitazone or dephosphorylation increased Nogo-B expression at mRNA and protein levels in HepG2 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes. Furthermore, we identified a PPARγ response element (PPRE) in Nogo-B promoter and found PPARγ enhanced Nogo-B transcription in a PPRE-dependent manner. ChIP assay further confirms rosiglitazone enhanced the binding of PPARγ to Nogo-B promoter. Using a  specific PPARγ deficient mice, we determined the critical role of PPARγ expression in regulating hepatic Nogo-B expression. Increased glucose and palmitate in culture medium activated Nogo-B and PPARγ expression in mouse primary hepatocytes, and corresponding, high-fat diet (HFD) induced  associated with increased hepatic Nogo-B and PPARγ expression in mice. Similarly, serum Nogo-B levels in patients with NAFLD were increased. However, rosiglitazone treatment reduced HFD-induced  and Nogo-B expression.

Using the fibrosis-4 score (< 1.45 for low risk of advanced fibrosis and > 3.25 for high risk of advanced fibrosis) in combination with the  stiffness measurement cutoffs revealed the best diagnostic performance (< 8.8 kPa for low risk of advanced fibrosis and > 10.9 kPa for high risk of advanced fibrosis). This paired combination had the positive predictive value of 0.735 at a sensitivity of 89% and the negative predictive value of 0.932 at a specificity of 82%.A paired combination of the fibrosis-4 score and  stiffness measurement (< 8.8 kPa for exclusion of advanced fibrosis and > 10.9 kPa for inclusion of advanced fibrosis) is able to diagnose the patients with advanced fibrosis with the highest diagnostic accuracy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628409>Accuracy of proton magnetic resonance for diagnosing non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: a meta-analysis.</a></h2><p> biopsy is the reference standard test to differentiate between non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and simple steatosis (SS) in non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), but noninvasive diagnostics are warranted. The diagnostic accuracy in NASH using MR imaging modality have not yet been clearly identified. This study was assessed the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method for diagnosing NASH. Data were extracted from research articles obtained after a literature search from multiple electronic databases. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to obtain overall effect size of the area under the receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curve, sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios(LR), diagnostic odds ratio(DOR) of MRI method in detecting histopathologically-proven SS(or non-NASH) and NASH. Seven studies were analyzed 485 patients, which included 207 SS and 278 NASH. The pooled sensitivity was 87.4% (95% CI, 76.4-95.3) and specificity was 74.3% (95% CI, 62.4-84.6). Pooled positive LR was 2.59 (95% CI, 1.96-3.42) and negative LR was 0.17 (95% CI, 0.07-0.38). DOR was 21.57 (95% CI, 7.27-63.99). The area under the curve of summary ROC was 0.89. Our meta-analysis shows that the MRI-based diagnostic methods are valuable additions in detecting NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635470> transplantation - changes in indications over last decade.</a></h2><p>To achieve satisfactory results of  transplantation, proper selection of transplant candidates is essential.

Patients with  damage most often reported to internal medicine specialists (59%) and gastroenterologists (27.5%). The diagnosis was based on abnormal aminotransferases (80.8%) and abdominal ultrasound examination (89.9%). Computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (50.2%) and  biopsy (22.4%) were used to assess fibrosis. Almost all respondents recommended reduction of body mass and lifestyle changes, and less than half (46.4%) recommended pharmacological treatment.NAFLD was the most common  disease that was the reason for medical consultations, but its incidence seems to be underestimated due to referral for further diagnostics only in patients with abnormal aminotransferases.

The regeneration process consists of a complex network of cells and organs, including  cells (parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells) and extrahepatic organs (thyroid, adrenal glands, pancreas, duodenum, spleen, and autonomic nervous system). The regeneration process of a normal, healthy  depends mainly on hepatocyte proliferation, growth, and programmed cell death. Cell proliferation and growth are regulated in a cooperative manner by interleukin (IL)-6/janus kinase (Jak)/signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 (STAT3), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K)/phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1)/Akt pathways. The IL-6/Jak/STAT3 pathway regulates hepatocyte proliferation and protects against cell death and oxidative stress. The PI3-K/PDK1/Akt pathway is primarily responsible for the regulation of cell size, sending mitotic signals in addition to pro-survival, antiapoptotic and antioxidative signals. Though programmed cell death may interfere with  regeneration in a pathological situation, it seems to play an important role during the termination phase, even in a normal, healthy  regeneration. However, further study is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms regulating the processes of  regeneration with regard to cell-to-cell and organ-to-organ networks at the molecular and cellular levels.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To address this knowledge gap, we aimed to develop a model for predicting non-completion of a specialist multidisciplinary service for clinically severe obesity, termed the Metabolic Rehabilitation Programme (MRP).Using a case-control study design in a public hospital setting, we extracted data from medical records for all eligible patients with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥35 kg/m with either type 2 diabetes or  disease referred to the MRP from 2010 through 2015. Non-completion status (case definition) was coded for patients whom started but dropped-out of the MRP within 12 months. Using multivariable logistic regression, we tested the following baseline predictors hypothesised in previous research: age, gender, BMI, waist circumference, residential distance from the clinic, blood pressure, obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), current continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, current depression/anxiety, diabetes status, and medications. We used receiver operating characteristics and area under the curve to test the performance of models.Out of the 219 eligible patient records, 78 (35.6%) non-completion cases were identified. Significant differences between non-completers versus completers were: age (47.1 versus 54.5 years, p < 0.001); residential distance from the clinic (21.8 versus 17.1 km, p = 0.018); obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) (42.9% versus 56.7%, p = 0.050) and CPAP therapy (11.7% versus 28.4%, p = 0.005). The probability of non-completion could be independently associated with age, residential distance, and either OSA or CPAP. There was no statistically significant difference in performance between the alternate models (69.5% versus 66.4%, p = 0.57).Non-completion of intensive specialist obesity management services is most common among younger patients, with fewer complex care needs, and those living further away from the clinic. Clinicians should be aware of these potential risk factors for dropping out early when managing outpatients with severe obesity, whereas policy makers might consider strategies for increasing access to specialist obesity management services.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665641>Maternal Lipid Metabolism Directs Fetal  Programming following Nutrient Stress.</a></h2><p>The extreme metabolic demands of pregnancy require coordinated metabolic adaptations between mother and fetus to balance fetal growth and maternal health with nutrient availability. To determine maternal and fetal contributions to metabolic flexibility during gestation, pregnant mice with genetic impairments in mitochondrial carbohydrate and/or lipid metabolism were subjected to nutrient deprivation. The maternal fasting response initiates a fetal  transcriptional program marked by upregulation of lipid- and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparα)-regulated genes. Impaired maternal lipid metabolism alters circulating lipid metabolite concentrations and enhances the fetal response to fasting, which is largely dependent on fetal Pparα. Maternal fasting also improves metabolic deficits in fetal carbohydrate metabolism by increasing the availability of alternative substrates. Impairment of both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in pregnant dams further exacerbates the fetal  transcriptional response to nutrient deprivation. Together, these data demonstrate a regulatory role for mitochondrial macronutrient metabolism in mediating maternal-fetal metabolic communication, particularly when nutrients are limited.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

High UA was defined as ≥ 75th percentile by sex in children and adolescents.The population was stratified in four categories: (1) normal eGFR and absence of NAFLD (ReGFR/NAFLD) (n = 1,236); (2) ReGFR and absence of NAFLD (ReGFR/NAFLD (n = 155); (3) normal eGFR and presence of NAFLD (ReGFR/NAFLD (n = 1019); (4) presence of both conditions (ReGFR/NAFLD) (n = 155). Proportions of youth with high UA across the four categories were 17%, 30%, 33% and 46%, respectively (P < 0.0001). Young people with high levels of UA had odds ratio (95% CI) of 2.11 (1.43-3.11) for ReGFR; 2.82 (2.26-3.45) for NAFLD; and 5.04 (3.45-7.39) for both conditions (P < 0.0001 for all), independently of major confounders.High levels of UA were independently associated with ReGFR, NAFLD and the combination of both conditions in young people with OW/OB.

Host-microbial interaction has gained attention as one of the risk factors for NASH. Recently, -gene positive  expressing cell surface collagen-binding protein, Cnm (-positive ), was shown to aggravate NASH in model mice.

NASH was diagnosed histologically or by clinical score. The prevalence of -positive , oral hygiene and blood tests, including  enzymes, adipocytokines and inflammatory and fibrosis markers, were assessed in biopsy-proven or clinically suspected NASH among NAFLD.Prevalence of -positive  was significantly higher in patients with NASH than patients without NASH (OR 3.8; 95% CI 1.02 to 15.5). The -positive  was related to decreased numbers of naturally remaining teeth and increased type IV collagen 7S level (median (IQR) 10.0 (5.0-17.5) vs 20.0 (5.0-25.0), p=0.06; 5.1 (4.0-7.9) vs 4.4 (3.7-5.3), p=0.13, respectively).Prevalence of -positive  in the oral cavity could be related to fibrosis of NASH among NAFLD.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

LT teams will be dealing with obesity in the coming years, and it is necessary for them to recognize some key aspects surrounding the LT in obese patients. Obesity by itself should not be considered a contraindication for LT, but it should make LT teams pay special attention to cardiovascular risk assessment, in order to properly select candidates for LT. Obese patients may be at increased risk of perioperative respiratory and infectious complications, and it is necessary to establish preventive strategies. Data on patient and graft survival after LT are controversial and scarce, especially for long-term outcomes, but morbid obesity may adversely affect these outcomes, particularly in NAFLD. The backbone of obesity treatment should be diet and exercise, whilst being careful not to precipitate or worsen frailty and sarcopenia. Bariatric surgery is an alternative for treatment of obesity, and the ideal timing regarding LT is still unknown. Sleeve gastrectomy is probably the procedure that has the best evidence in LT because it offers a good balance between safety and efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653319>The Importance of Amerindian Ancestry on Nonalcoholic  Disease in the Hispanic/Latino American Population.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628998>Decreased Physical Working Capacity in Adolescents With Non-Alcoholic  Disease Associates With Reduced Iron Availability: PWC in NAFLD Relates to Iron Bioavailability.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is common and related to obesity and insulin resistance. Iron metabolism is impaired in obese individuals and iron deficiency has been associated with physical inactivity. We investigated whether iron bioavailability is reduced in patients with NAFLD and contributes to reduced cardiorespiratory fitness.We collected information on weight-adjusted, submaximal physical work capacity (PWC), ultrasound-determined hepatic steatosis, iron indices, and hematologic and metabolic parameters from 390 female and 458 male participants of the Raine Study-a longitudinal study of disease development in 2868 children in Western Australia. X and linear regression analyses were used to compare characteristics of study participants according to NAFLD status at age 17 years.Fourteen percent of the cohort had NAFLD. PWC was significantly reduced in adolescents with NAFLD compared to adolescents without NAFLD (reduction of 0.17 W/kg, P=.0003, adjusted for sex and body mass index [BMI]). Iron bioavailability (assessed by mean corpuscular volume [MCV], mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH], transferrin saturation, and serum levels of iron) was inversely correlated with BMI in adolescents with NAFLD (P≤.01 for all, adjusted for sex) but not in adolescents without NAFLD (P>.30). MCV and MCH correlated with PWC (MCV, P=.002 for female and P=.0003 male participants; MCH, P=.004 for female and P=.01 for male participants), irrespective of NAFLD status. Reduced PWC was associated with lower transferrin saturation in adolescents with NAFLD (reduction of 0.012 W/kg per unit decrease in transferrin saturation, P=.007) but not in adolescents without NAFLD (reduction of 0.001 W/kg, P=.40), adjusted for sex. This association was independent of MCV or MCH.In a well-defined cohort of adolescents, we found NAFLD to be associated with decreased cardiorespiratory fitness, independent of BMI. The relationship between transferrin saturation and PWC in adolescents with NAFLD indicates that functional iron deficiency might contribute to reductions in cardiorespiratory fitness.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

In the LIVEHIV and LHivPa cohorts, NAFLD was diagnosed if the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) was ≥ 248 dB/m; in the MHMC cohort, it was diagnosed if the /spleen Hounsfield unit (HU) ratio on abdominal computerized tomography scan was < 1.1. Medium/high-risk fibrosis category was defined as fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) ≥ 1.30. Patients requiring specialist referral to hepatology were defined as either having NAFLD and being in the medium/high-risk fibrosis category or having elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT).A total of 1534 HIV-infected adults without significant alcohol intake or viral hepatitis coinfection were included in the study. Of these, 313 (20.4%) patients had the metabolic comorbidities (obesity and/or diabetes) required for entry in the diagnostic algorithm. Among these patients, 123 (39.3%) required specialist referral to hepatology, according to guidelines. A total of 1062 patients with extended metabolic comorbidities (any among obesity, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia) represented most of the cases of NAFLD (79%), elevated ALT (75.9%) and medium/high-risk fibrosis category (75.4%). When the algorithm was extended to these patients, it was found that 341 (32.1%) would require specialist referral to hepatology.According to current guidelines, one in five HIV-monoinfected patients should undergo detailed assessment for NAFLD and disease severity. Moreover, one in ten should be referred to hepatology.

It is well known that insulin resistance, especially hepatic insulin resistance, is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Current research has shown that hepatic  acid accumulation can cause hepatic insulin resistance through increased gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired insulin signal pathway. Mitochondria are the major sites of  acid β-oxidation, which is the major degradation mechanism of  acids. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic  acid-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged mitochondria to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial  acid oxidation to inhibit hepatic  acid accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and hepatic insulin resistance. Additionally, we also highlight the potential value of mitophagy in the treatment of hepatic insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 Su, Nie, Huang, Zhu, Feng, Tang and Zheng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652359>Impacts of sex and exposure duration on gene expression in zebrafish following perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure.</a></h2><p>Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a member of the anthropogenic class of per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs), and is one of the most frequently detected PFAS in water, humans, mammals, and fish around the world. The zebrafish (Danio rerio), is a small freshwater fish considered an appropriate vertebrate model for investigating the toxicity of compounds. Previous investigations showed tissue-specific bioaccumulation and alterations in the expression of  acid binding proteins (fabps) in male and female zebrafish, potentially due to interactions between PFAS and  acid transporters. In addition, a number of neurological impacts have been reported as a result of human and animal exposure to PFAS. Therefore, this comprehensive study was designed to investigate whether PFOS exposure affects the expression of genes associated with  acid metabolism (fabp1a, fabp2, and fabp10a) in zebrafish , intestine, heart, and ovary and genes involved in the nervous system (ChAT, ngf, bdnf, AChE, and hdac6) in brain and muscle. Results indicate alterations in expression of genes associated with  acid metabolism and neural function that vary with both exposure concentration and sex.

We previously used a preclinical mouse (low density lipoprotein receptor null mouse,  model to assess transcriptomic mechanisms linked to WD-induced NASH and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6, ω3)-mediated remission of NASH. This report used livers from the previous study to carry out ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with dynamic multi-reaction monitoring (HPLC-dMRM) to assess the impact of the WD and DHA on hepatic membrane lipid and oxylipin composition, respectively. Feeding mice the WD increased hepatic saturated and monounsaturated  acids and arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4, ω6) in membrane lipids and suppressed ω3 polyunsaturated  acids (PUFA) in membrane lipids and ω3 PUFA-derived anti-inflammatory oxylipins. Supplementing the WD with DHA lowered hepatic ARA in membrane lipids and ARA-derived oxylipins and significantly increased hepatic DHA and its metabolites in membrane lipids, as well as C ω3 PUFA-derived oxylipins. NASH markers of inflammation and fibrosis were inversely associated with hepatic C ω3 PUFA-derived Cyp2C- and Cyp2J-generated anti-inflammatory oxylipins (false discovery rate adjusted -value;  ≤ 0.026). Our findings suggest that dietary DHA promoted partial remission of WD-induced NASH, at least in part, by lowering hepatic pro-inflammatory oxylipins derived from ARA and increasing hepatic anti-inflammatory oxylipins derived from C ω3 PUFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657972>RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTORC1 and TP53 pathways and regulatory miRs as therapeutic targets in hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Introduction Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant problem globally because of viral infections and the increasing incidence of obesity and  disease. However, it is difficult to treat because its inherent genetic heterogeneity results in activation of numerous signaling pathways. Kinases have been targeted for decades with varying results, but the development of therapeutic resistance is a major challenge. Areas covered The key roles of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTORC1, TP53 microRNAs (miRs) as therapeutic targets are discussed and we suggests novel approaches for targeting miRs or their downstream targets to combat HCC. We performed literature searches using the Medline Database from 2000 to the present. Expert Opinion. The involvement of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTORC and TP53 pathways as drivers of the disease and drug resistance is a challenge. Moreover, miRs regulate the expression of key genes in these pathways. What we and others are proposing is the prospect of targeting miRs and their downstream targets to improve conventional approaches to treat HCC. Combination approaches are often promising because multiple signaling pathways are deregulated due to diverse mutations and events.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649231> in a two days old neonate.</a></h2><p>Neonatal death due to inborn error of metabolism (IEM) is rare in Malaysia.

Recently, a new score was developed to estimate body fat percentage (relative fat mass, RFM). We aimed to evaluate the value of RFM in predicting the presence and severity of NAFLD, compared with other anthropometric measurements.RFM, body mass index (BMI), and other anthropometric measurements were evaluated in two cohorts of subjects: a cohort from a Portuguese prospective epidemiological study (e_Cor) and morbidly obese patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. We evaluated if RFM and BMI were related with the presence and severity of  disease, which was assessed by noninvasive tools in the first cohort and by  histology in the morbidly obese cohort. The independence of relations found in univariate analysis was assessed with multivariable logistic regression analysis.In the general population cohort, 744 subjects (48% male) were enrolled. BMI-defined obesity was present in 23% and RFM-defined obesity in 86%. Insulin resistance (IR) related with BMI-defined obesity (OR 4.37 [2.16-8.84]) and weight (OR 1.05 [1.02-1.08]) in men, and waist circumference (WC) (OR 1.07 [1.03-1.11]) in women. Dyslipidemia and hypertension related with RFM-defined obesity in men (OR 2.96 [1.36-6.47] and OR 5.37 [1.31-22.06], respectively). Ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD in 33% related with weight in men (OR 1.03 [1.003-1.06] and WC in women (OR 1.06 [1.02-1.10]). In men, ALT elevation related with weight (OR 1.04 [1.02-1.07]). In women, advanced fibrosis (estimated by NAFLD Fibrosis Score) associated with BMI-defined obesity (OR 42.43 [3.61-498.13]). In the morbidly obese cohort, 152 subjects were enrolled, of whom 84% were female, 37% had steatohepatitis, and 9.4% had advanced fibrosis. Adiponectin associated inversely and leptin positively with RFM in men. The severity of steatosis increased linearly with BMI and WC in women. Higher BMI associated with steatohepatitis in women and advanced fibrosis in men.RFM-defined obesity better predicted dyslipidemia and hypertension (though not IR) and adipokine imbalance; however, it did not add value to BMI-defined obesity in predicting NAFLD or  injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643709>Thiazolidinediones.</a></h2><p>The thiazolidinediones are a relatively new family of agents for type 2 diabetes that act by increasing insulin sensitivity through a unique mechanism of engagement of the so-called peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, PPAR-γ. Attachment of ligand to the PPAR-γ receptor activates a series of genes that are involved in glucose and  acid metabolism, the overall effect being an increase in insulin effect. The thiazolidinediones reduce blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and act additively with other antidiabetic medications. Troglitazone was the first thiazolidinedione that received approval for use in the United States (January 1997). However, within a year of its approval, reports of severe  injury and deaths from acute  failure began to appear. Cautionary statements and recommendations for monitoring of ALT levels were made, but after more than two dozen reports of hepatic failure and the introduction of two new thiazolidinediones in 1999, troglitazone was withdrawn from use in 2000. The newer thiazolidinediones, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, have been associated with only rare instances of acute  injury. Both rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are linked to increased weight gain, heart failure and fracture risk and they are considered second-line agents for type 2 diabetes and recommended only after failure of metformin and lifestyle modifications. All references on hepatotoxicity of the thiazolidinediones are given together at the end of this Overview section (updated June 2018).

We compared real-life healthcare costs of patients with NAFLD to matched controls.We performed a retrospective study of 646 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD in Sweden from 1971 through 2009. Each patient was matched for age, sex, and county of residence with 10 persons from the general population (controls). We retrieved all healthcare contacts through Dec 31, 2014 from national registers. Unit costs were assigned to arrive at a total healthcare cost (in USD [$]) per study subject.During a mean follow-up of 19.9 years, we recorded a mean of 0.27 hospitalizations per year for patients with NAFLD vs 0.16 for controls (P<.001). This corresponded to an incremental cost of $635 per year for patients with NAFLD. Patients with NAFLD had a higher mean use of outpatient care visits: 1.46 contacts per year compared with 0.86 per year in controls, corresponding to $255 in additional costs (P<.001). Total costs incurred by patients with stage 3-4 fibrosis were higher than by patients with fibrosis stage 0-2 (mean annual costs, $4397 vs $629). Cumulative costs were higher for all stages of fibrosis compared to controls.Healthcare costs are nearly twice as high in patients with NAFLD than in matched controls. This is mostly attributable to higher costs for hospitalizations, but also to more outpatient visits. Patients with advanced fibrosis had the highest costs.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

The major risk factor for  cancer is cirrhosis with the underlying causes of cirrhosis being viral infection (hepatitis B or C), metabolic deregulation (Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) in the presence of obesity and diabetes), alcohol or cholestatic disorders. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid with numerous effects, most of them compatible with the hallmarks of cancer (proliferation, migration, invasion, survival, evasion of apoptosis, deregulated metabolism, neoangiogenesis, etc.). Autotaxin (ATX) is the enzyme responsible for the bulk of extracellular LPA production, and together with LPA signaling is involved in chronic inflammatory diseases, fibrosis and cancer. This review discusses the most important findings and the mechanisms related to ATX/LPA/LPAR involvement on metabolic, viral and cholestatic  disorders and their progression to  cancer in the context of human patients and mouse models. It focuses on the role of ATX/LPA in NAFLD development and its progression to  cancer as NAFLD has an increasing incidence which is associated with the increasing incidence of  cancer. Bearing in mind that adipose tissue accounts for the largest amount of LPA production, many studies have implicated LPA in adipose tissue metabolism and inflammation,  steatosis, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and lipogenesis. At the same time, LPA and ATX play crucial roles in fibrotic diseases. Given that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is usually developed on the background of  fibrosis, therapies that both delay the progression of fibrosis and prevent its development to malignancy would be very promising. Therefore, ATX/LPA signaling appears as an attractive therapeutic target as evidenced by the fact that it is involved in both  fibrosis progression and  cancer development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643245>Propofol.</a></h2><p>Propofol is the mostly commonly used parenteral anesthetic agent in the United States, extensively used for minor and outpatient surgical procedures because of its rapid onset and reversal of action, and in intensive care units (ICUs) for maintenance of coma.

Changes in the expression levels and activities of drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters have been reported in patients with NAFLD and relevant rodent models. Here, we evaluated whether the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolic acid (MPA), an immunosuppressant, would be altered in rats with NAFLD. NAFLD was induced by feeding a diet containing 1% (w/w) orotic acid for 20 days. The extent of hepatic glucuronidation of MPA to a major metabolite, mycophenolic acid-7-O-glucuronide (MPAG), did not differ between rats with NAFLD and controls. The expression levels of hepatic multidrug resistance-associated protein 2, responsible for biliary excretion of MPAG, were comparable in rats with NAFLD and controls; the biliary excretion of MPAG was also similar in the two groups. Compared with control rats, rats with NAFLD did not exhibit significant changes in the areas under the plasma concentration-time curves of MPA or MPAG after intravenous (5 mg/kg) or oral (10 mg/kg) administration of MPA. However, delayed oral absorption of MPA was observed in rats with NAFLD compared with controls; the MPA and MPAG peak plasma concentrations fell significantly and the times to achieve them were prolonged following oral administration of MPA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632457>Effect of orlistat on  fat content in patients with nonalcoholic  disease with obesity: assessment using magnetic resonance imaging-derived proton density fat fraction.</a></h2><p>The  effect of orlistat as a weight control treatment in patients with nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) with obesity remains undetermined. This study quantified  fat improvement by orlistat in a Chinese cohort with NAFLD accompanied by obesity, diagnosed by a lower body mass index threshold than that for White patients.We conducted a parallel-group, open-label, 24-week, randomized clinical trial registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-IPR-17012258). Obese participants with NAFLD were randomized 1:1.5 to the intervention group with orlistat or conventional care.  fat quantification was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging-based proton density fat fraction with Dixon sequence.Overall, 170 ( = 68, orlistat 120 mg three times/day and  = 102, conventional therapy) and 130 patients with NAFLD ( = 56, orlistat and  = 74, conventional therapy) were included for intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analysis, respectively. Orlistat reduced  fat content to a greater degree than conventional care [-5.45%  -1.96%,  < 0.001 (ITT analysis) and -6.66%  -2.68%,  < 0.001 (PP analysis)]. The 6-month rate of decrease in steatosis grades was higher in the orlistat group [45.6%  22.5% (ITT analysis), 57.4%  30.3% (PP analysis), both  < 0.001]. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified orlistat treatment [odds ratio (OR) = 2.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-5.6,  = 0.036] as an independent predictor of steatosis improvement. Among patients with orlistat therapy, weight loss (OR = 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.4,  = 0.040) and severe steatosis (OR = 6.7, 95% CI: 1.1-40.3,  = 0.03) remained predictive of steatosis improvement.Orlistat can effectively promote steatosis improvement and may serve as a treatment option for controlling NAFLD.ChiCTR-IPR-17012258.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668954>Prenatal exposure to diesel exhaust PM programmed non-alcoholic  disease differently in adult male offspring of mice fed normal chow and a high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>Air pollution is one of the leading preventable threats to public health. Emerging evidence indicates that exposure to environmental stressors is associated with abnormal foetal development. However, how prenatal exposure to diesel exhaust PM (DEP) predisposes adult offspring to the development of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) remains unclear. To examine this, C57BL/6J mice were exposed to DEP or a vehicle before conception and during pregnancy and fed normal chow or a high-fat diet. Then, the hepatic  accumulation in the adult male offspring and possible molecular mechanisms were assessed. Our data showed that prenatal exposure to DEP on normal chow led to hepatic steatosis in adult male offspring with normal  function. However, prenatal DEP exposure relieved the hepatic steatosis and  function in offspring of mice fed a high-fat diet. Furthermore, prenatal exposure to DEP on normal chow increased lipogenesis and worsened  acid oxidation. The counteractive effect of prenatal DEP exposure on high-fat-diet-induced hepatic steatosis was produced through upregulated adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase, and this improved lipogenesis and  acid oxidation. Collectively, prenatal exposure to DEP programmed the development of NAFLD differently in the adult male offspring of mice fed normal chow and a high-fat diet, showing the pleotrophic effects of exposure to adverse environmental factors in early life.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether epigenetics and environmental factors interact to promote progressive NAFLD during IR. We examined the miRNA signature in insulin receptor haploinsufficient (InsR+/-) and wild-type (wt) HSCs by RNAseq ( = 4 per group). Then, we evaluated their impact in an IR-NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) model (InsR+/- mice fed standard or methionine choline deficient (MCD) diet,  = 10 per group) and in vitro. InsR+/- HSCs displayed 36 differentially expressed miRNAs ( < 0.05 vs. wt), whose expression was then analyzed in the  of InsR+/- mice fed an MCD diet. We found that miR-101-3p negatively associated with both InsR+/- genotype and MCD ( < 0.05) and the histological spectrum of  damage ( < 0.01). miR-101-3p was reduced in InsR+/- hepatocytes and HSCs and even more in InsR+/- cells exposed to insulin (0.33 µM) and  acids (0.25 mM), resembling the IR-NASH model. Conversely, insulin induced miR-101-3p expression in wt cells but not in InsR+/- ones ( < 0.05).

After a mean follow-up period of 11.4±2.5 months, follow-up ultrasonography with ASQ and MRS were performed on 27 patients to evaluate whether hepatic steatosis had improved. The focal disturbance (FD) ratio, as calculated using ASQ, and the hepatic fat fraction (HFF), estimated by MRS, were obtained at both initial and follow-up examinations.

However, the currently used supplements do not appreciably enrich brain DHA, although they enrich most other tissues. We tested the hypothesis that the ability of the dietary carrier to augment brain DHA depends upon the generation of DHA-lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), the preferred carrier of DHA across the blood brain barrier. We compared the efficacy of DHA-triacylglycerol (TAG), di-DHA phosphatidylcholine (PC) and DHA-LPC to enrich brain DHA following their gavage to normal rats for 30 days, all at a dose of 10 mg DHA/day. The results show that DHA from TAG, which is released as free DHA or monoacylglycerol during digestion and is absorbed as TAG in chylomicrons, was incorporated preferentially into adipose tissue and heart but not into brain. In contrast, LPC-DHA increased brain DHA by up to 100% but had no effect on adipose tissue. Di-DHA PC, which generates both free DHA and LPC-DHA during the digestion, enriched DHA in brain, as well as in heart and . Brain-derived neurotrophic factor was increased by di-DHA PC and DHA-LPC, but not by TAG-DHA, showing that enrichment of brain DHA correlated with its functional effect. We conclude that dietary DHA from TAG or from natural PC (sn-2 position) is not suitable for brain enrichment, whereas DHA from LPC (at either sn-1 or sn-2 position) or from sn-1 position of PC efficiently enriches the brain and is functionally effective.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662869>Individualized risk prediction of significant fibrosis in non-alcoholic  disease using a novel nomogram.</a></h2><p>Fibrosis is deemed to be a pivotal determinant of the long-term prognosis in non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD).We aimed to develop a novel nomogram-based non-invasive model to accurately predict significant fibrosis in patients with NAFLD.We designed a prospective cohort study including 207 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. Detailed anthropometric and fibrosis-related laboratory parameters were collected. A nomogram was established based on variables that were independently associated with significant fibrosis identified by the logistic regression model. Then it was compared with aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), FIB-4 and BARD score.

The prevalence of non-alcoholic  diseases (NAFLD) has been observed prominently in obese and diabetic individuals, while alcoholic  disease is common in alcoholic persons.  disease, such as steatohepatitis, leads to fibrosis, cirrhosis and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) against high-fat diet (HFD) and ethanol (EtOH)-induced hepatotoxicity in rats.Male Wistar rats (150-200 g) were fed HFD (58% calories from fat) and EtOH (3-15% in drinking water) for 12 weeks. 7,8-DHF was administered intraperitoneally at the dose of 5 mg/kg/day for the last four weeks. After 12 weeks, biochemical, ELISA, RT-PCR, and histological studies have been carried out.Biochemical analyses revealed the involvement of oxidative stress and inflammation in the  of HFD and EtOH-fed rats. 7,8-DHF treatment significantly reduced HFD and EtOH-induced oxidative stress as evidenced by the reduction of lipid peroxidation and augmentation of reduced glutathione level. Moreover, IL-1β level was found significantly reduced in 7,8-DHF treated EtOH, HFD and EtOH+HFD groups. The semi-quantitative RT-PCR results indicated down-regulation of Nrf-2 and HO-1 and up-regulation of NF-κB and iNOS mRNA expression level in the  of HFD and EtOH-fed rats, which was ameliorated by 7,8-DHF treatment.The present study suggested that 7,8-DHF could be an effective pharmacological intervention in combating HFD and EtOH-induced hepatotoxicity.Copyright © 2019 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

For diagnosis of F ≥ 2, F ≥ 3, and F ≥ 3 plus NASH, respectively, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed superior diagnostic accuracy of ELF score (area under ROC curve (AUROC) 0.85, 0.90, 0.90), FibroMeter (AUROC 0.86, 0.88, 0.89), FibroMeter (AUROC 0.84, 0.88, 0.88), and LSM per protocol (AUROC 0.87, 0.95, 0.91) versus FIB-4 (AUROC 0.80, 0.82, 0.81) or NFS (AUROC 0.78, 0.80, 0.79).Proprietary fibrosis panels and VCTE show superior diagnostic accuracy for noninvasive diagnosis of fibrosis stage in NAFLD as compared to FIB-4 and NFS.© Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672448>Effects of newer antidiabetic drugs on nonalcoholic  and steatohepatitis: think out of the box!</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic  disease in Western societies and a major cause of hepatic disease worldwide. Its more severe type, namely nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), may result in the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD, and especially NASH, are also associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) predisposes to NAFLD development and progression via insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. It has also been reported that the majority of T2DM patients have NAFLD/NASH, thus potentially further increasing their cardiometabolic risk. Current guidelines recommend to screen for NAFLD in all T2DM patients and vice-versa. Lifestyle remains the first-line therapeutic option for NAFLD/NASH. Among antidiabetic drugs, pioglitazone was shown to improve histological features of NASH. More recently, there is an increasing interest regarding the effects of newer anti-diabetic drugs, such as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on NAFLD/NASH. The present narrative review considers the up-to-date data on the impact of DPP-4i, SGLT2i, and GLP-1 RAs on biochemical and/or histological markers of NAFLD/NASH. The potential clinical implications of these findings in daily practice are also discussed. Taking into consideration the global increasing prevalence of NAFLD/NASH, therapeutic options that can prevent or treat this disease will exert considerable benefits on human health.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we performed lipidomic analyses on mouse plasma and nine tissues, including the , kidney, brain, white adipose, heart, lung, small intestine, skeletal muscle, and spleen, with the dietary intake conditions of arachidonic acid (ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as the ethyl ester form. We incorporated targeted and untargeted approaches for profiling oxylipins and complex lipids such as glycerol (phospho) lipids, sphingolipids, and sterols, respectively, which led to the characterization of 1026 lipid molecules from the mouse tissues. The lipidomic analysis indicated that the intake of PUFAs strongly impacted the lipid profiles of metabolic organs such as the  and kidney, while causing less impact on the brain. Moreover, we revealed a unique lipid modulation in most tissues, where phospholipids containing linoleic acid were significantly decreased in mice on the ARA-supplemented diet, and bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) selectively incorporated DHA over ARA and EPA. We comprehensively studied the lipid profiles after dietary intake of PUFAs, which gives insight into lipid metabolism and nutrition research on PUFA supplementation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645151>From circadian clocks to non-alcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>: The circadian rhythm is an integral regulator of various endocrine processes in the body, including sleep-wake cycles, hormonal regulation, and metabolism. In addition to metabolic, genetic, and environmental factors, a dysregulated circadian rhythm resulting from lifestyle changes has been implicated in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD). An accumulating body of evidence also supports strong association between NAFLD and metabolic disorder, the pathogenesis of which is related to periodic fluctuations in hormonal homeostasis. It is clear that endocrine and circadian rhythms are tightly interconnected. Generally, the circadian rhythm regulates flux patterns of physiological functions. The present review will discuss the modulation of bodily processes by the circadian rhythm with specific attention to the regulation of NAFLD by leptin and related hormones.: PubMed/MEDLINE was searched for articles related to concomitant occurrence of NAFLD and T2DM between January 1995 and September 2019. Areas covered included epidemiological, physiology and pathophysiology aspects.: NAFLD and NASH are increasingly prevalent and may be largely mitigated with effective lifestyle modification and, potentially, circadian rhythm stabilization.

The only hope for curative treatment or significant increase in life expectancy is early detection. Once patients have progressed towards end-stage HCC, effective treatment options are extremely limited on the background of a very high degree of heterogeneity in clinical presentation and outcome. Experimental chronic  injury and cancer have been used extensively to mimic the human disease. In particular, mouse studies have advanced the field due to the ability to easily manipulate the mouse genome and transcriptome for mechanistic evaluations. In addition, they offer the opportunity to screen new therapeutic strategies cost-effectively and in quick high-throughput, large-scale formats. The most commonly used mouse models in HCC research can be categorized as chemotoxic, diet-induced, and genetically engineered models. It is important to note that no particular model mimics all features of a given HCC etiology or histological subtype, and each model poses advantages and disadvantages that need to be carefully considered.Copyright: The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658496>Dietary Fish Oil Alters DNA Methylation of Genes Involved in Polyunsaturated  Acid Biosynthesis in Muscle and  of Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar).</a></h2><p>Adequate dietary supply of eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) is required to maintain health and growth of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). However, salmon can also convert α-linolenic acid (18:3n-3) into eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) by sequential desaturation and elongation reactions, which can be modified by 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 intake. In mammals, dietary 20:5n-3 + 22:6n-3 intake can modify Fads2 expression (Δ6 desaturase) via altered DNA methylation of its promoter. Decreasing dietary fish oil (FO) has been shown to increase Δ5fad expression in salmon . However, it is not known whether this is associated with changes in the DNA methylation of genes involved in polyunsaturated  acid synthesis. To address this, we investigated whether changing the proportions of dietary FO and vegetable oil altered the DNA methylation of Δ6fad_b, Δ5fad, Elovl2, and Elovl5_b promoters in  and muscle from Atlantic salmon and whether any changes were associated with mRNA expression. Higher dietary FO content increased the proportions of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 and decreased Δ6fad_b mRNA expression in , but there was no effect on Δ5fad, Elovl2, and Elovl5_b expression. There were significant differences between  and skeletal muscle in the methylation of individual CpG loci in all four genes studied. Methylation of individual Δ6fad_b CpG loci was negatively related to its expression and to proportions of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 in the . These findings suggest variations in dietary FO can induce gene-, CpG locus-, and tissue-related changes in DNA methylation in salmon.© 2019 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655165>Disturbance of mitochondrial functions associated with permeability transition pore opening induced by cis-5-tetradecenoic and myristic acids in  of adolescent rats.</a></h2><p>Patients affected by very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency commonly present  dysfunction whose pathogenesis is poorly known.

Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) occurs when fat is deposited (steatosis) in the  due to causes other than excessive alcohol use and is associated with  fibrosis. In this study, we asked whether miR-29a could reduce experimental high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and  fibrosis in mice. We performed systematical expression analyses of miR-29a transgenic mice (miR-29aTg mice) and wild-type littermates subjected to HFD-induced NAFLD. The results demonstrated that increased miR-29a not only alleviated HFD-induced body weight gain but also subcutaneous, visceral, and intestinal fat accumulation and hepatocellular steatosis in mice. Furthermore, hepatic tissue in the miR-29aTg mice displayed a weak fibrotic matrix concomitant with low fibrotic collagen1α1 expression within the affected tissues compared to the wild-type (WT) mice fed the HFD diet. Increased miR-29a signaling also resulted in the downregulation of expression of the epithelial mesenchymal transition-executing transcription factor , mesenchymal markers , and such pro-inflammation markers as  and  within the  tissue. Meanwhile, miR-29aTg-HFD mice exhibited significantly lower levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), mitochondrial transcription factor A TFAM, and mitochondria DNA content in the  than the WT-HFD mice. An in vitro luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that miR-29a mimic transfection reduced  acid translocase CD36 expression in HepG2 cells.

This study aimed to investigate BA profile alterations in Chinese nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients.BA profiles in serum and  tissues were determined by ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry in patients from two different clinical centers.A total of 134 participants were enrolled in this study to serve as the training (n = 87) and validation (n = 47) cohorts. The ratio of circulating conjugated chenodeoxycholic acids to muricholic acids (P = 0.001) was elevated from healthy controls to non-NASH individuals to NASH individuals in a stepwise manner in the training cohort and was positively associated with the histological severity of NASH: steatosis (R  = 0.12), lobular inflammation (R  = 0.12), ballooning (R  = 0.11), and fibrosis stage (R  = 0.18). The ratio was elevated in the validation cohort of NASH patients (P < 0.001), and it was able to predict NASH (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 75%) and significant fibrosis (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 71%) in these two cohorts. Moreover, this elevated ratio and impaired farnesoid X receptor signaling were found in the NASH .Altered BA profile in NASH is closely associated with the severity of  lesions, and it has the potential for predicting NASH development.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654131>Accuracy of  stiffness measurement and controlled attenuation parameter using FibroScan M/XL probes to diagnose  fibrosis and steatosis in patients with nonalcoholic  disease: a multicenter prospective study.</a></h2><p>Few studies have evaluated both  fibrosis and steatosis in patients with nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) using both FibroScan M and XL probes.

The enzyme glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), the most important enzyme implicated in S-adenosylmethionine catabolism in the , is downregulated during NAFLD progression. We have studied the mechanism involved in GNMT downregulation by its repressor microRNA miR-873-5p and the metabolic pathways affected in NAFLD as well as the benefit of recovery GNMT expression.miR-873-5p and GNMT expression were evaluated in  biopsies of NAFLD/NASH patients. Different in vitro and in vivo NAFLD murine models were used to assess miR-873-5p/GNMT involvement in  progression through targeting of the miR-873-5p as NAFLD therapy.We describe a new function of GNMT as an essential regulator of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain in the mitochondria. In NAFLD, GNMT expression is controlled by miR-873-5p in the hepatocytes, leading to disruptions in mitochondrial functionality in a preclinical murine non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model. Upregulation of miR-873-5p is shown in the  of NAFLD/NASH patients, correlating with hepatic GNMT depletion. Importantly, NASH therapies based on anti-miR-873-5p resolve lipid accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis by enhancing  acid β-oxidation in the mitochondria. Therefore, miR-873-5p inhibitor emerges as a potential tool for NASH treatment.GNMT participates in the regulation of metabolic pathways and mitochondrial functionality through the regulation of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain. In NAFLD, GNMT is repressed by miR-873-5p and its targeting arises as a valuable therapeutic option for treatment.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

The earliest stage of NAFLD is simple steatosis, which is characterized by the accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes. Inhibition of steatosis is a potential treatment for NAFLD. Patchouli alcohol (PA) is an active component of  (Blanco) Benth. (Labiatae), which is a medicinal food in Asia countries and proved to possess hepatoprotective effect. This research aimed to investigate the effectiveness of PA against high fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis in rats. In this study, male Sprague Dawley rats were fed a HFD for 4 weeks to induce NAFLD. Oral administration with PA significantly reduced pathological severity of steatosis in HFD-fed rats. It was associated with suppressing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and regulating very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) metabolism. Our data showed that PA treatment effectively attenuated ER stress by inhibiting the activation of protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Moreover, PA decreased hepatic VLDL uptake by suppressing very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) expression. It also restored VLDL synthesis and export by increasing apolipoprotein B100 (apoB 100) secretion and microsomal triglyceride-transfer protein (MTP) activity. Taken together, PA exerted a protective effect on the treatment of NAFLD in HFD-fed rats and may be potential therapeutic agent acting on hepatic steatosis.Copyright © 2019 Wu, Xu, Li, Huang, Wu, Gan, Chen, Luo, Li, Huang, Su and Liu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675670>Ginsenoside Rg1 ameliorates palmitic acid-induced insulin resistance in HepG2 cells in association with modulating Akt and JNK activity.</a></h2><p>Hepatic insulin resistance can be induced by excess dietary intake of saturated fat. Ginsenoside Rg1 (GRg1), the major active ginsenoside enriched in tonic food ginseng, was reported to help alleviate  diseases. In the present study, GRg1 was evaluated for its impact on palmitic acid (PA)-induced hepatic insulin resistance model in vitro.Insulin resistance in HepG2 cells was induced by 0.5 mM PA exposure for 24 h and then the effect of GRg1 on cellular glucose consumption was measured. Expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphate (G6Pase) were analyzed by Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Activation of protein kinases and transcript factor was analyzed by measuring protein phosphorylation. The influence of GRg1 on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in HepG2 was also examined.GRg1 reversed PA-induced decrease in glucose consumption of HepG2 cells by downregulating gluconeogenesis genes G6pase and PEPCK. GRg1 increased Akt activation but inhibited JNK activation in PA-challenged HepG2 cells. Cellular ROS level was elevated in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells but was reduced by GRg1.Together these findings indicate that GRg1 protects against hepatic insulin resistance via preserving insulin signaling sensitivity and is a promising alternative medicine.Copyright © 2019.

Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) supplementation reduces fructose-induced non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study was to determine the role of FGF21 and underlying mechanisms in the protective effects of LGG.FGF21 knockout (KO) mice and C57BL/6 wild type (WT) mice were fed 30% fructose for 12 weeks. LGG was administered to the mice in the last 4 weeks during fructose feeding. FGF21-adiponectin (ADPN)-mediated hepatic lipogenesis and inflammation were investigated.FGF21 expression was robustly increased after 5-weeks of feeding and significantly decreased after 12-weeks of feeding in fructose-induced NAFLD mice. LGG administration reversed the depressed FGF21 expression, increased adipose production of ADPN, and reduced hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation in the WT mice but not in the KO mice. Hepatic nuclear carbohydrate responsive-element binding protein (ChREBP) was increased by fructose and reduced by LGG, resulting in a reduction in the expression of lipogenic genes. The methylated form of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) C, which dephosphorylates and activates ChREBP, was upregulated by fructose and normalized by LGG. Leucine carboxyl methyltransferase-1, which methylates PP2AC, was also increased by fructose and decreased by LGG. However, those beneficial effects of LGG were blunted in the KO mice. Hepatic dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate, which inhibits PP2A, was markedly increased by LGG in the WT mice but attenuated in the KO mice. LGG decreased adipose hypertrophy and increased serum levels of ADPN, which regulates sphingosine metabolism. This beneficial effect was decreased in the KO mice.LGG administration increases hepatic FGF21 expression and serum ADPN concentration, resulting in a reduced ChREBP activation through dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate-mediated PP2A deactivation, and subsequently reversed fructose-induced NAFLD. Thus, our data suggest that FGF21 is required for the beneficial effects of LGG in reversal of fructose-induced NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Combination antiretroviral therapy decrease mortality and morbidity in HIV patients, but lead to increase in insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, abnormalities of fat distribution and high risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, a metabolic clinic was established for individuals living with HIV in the Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. The clinic meets considerable demands by service users and hence has the potential to be popular. This review focuses on the importance of the development of a metabolic clinic for the purpose of audit, research, teaching and exchange of knowledge between HIV specialists and the metabolic team in the management of complex cases. Therefore, the metabolic clinic should be an integral part of HIV services especially as the cohort of the 'older' HIV population increases.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We analyzed data from 2239 hypertensive patients using descriptive statistics and supervised machine learning algorithms, including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and random forest classifier, to select the most relevant features of NASH.  The prevalence of NASH among our hypertensive patients was 11.3%. In univariate analyses, it was associated with metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Ferritin and serum insulin were the most relevant features in the final model, with a sensitivity of 70%, specificity of 79%, and area under the curve of 0.79.  Ferritin and insulin are significant predictors of NASH. Clinicians may use these to better assess cardiovascular risk and provide better management to hypertensive patients with NASH.

The primary end point was set as the change of  index (FLI) as a surrogate parameter of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). Six-hundred and ninety-seven subjects (38 with T2DM) were enrolled. A baseline FLI ≥ 60 (the threshold for ) was found in 264 subjects (37.9%). The mean duration of fasting was 8.5 ± 4.0 days (range 6-38). FLI decreased significantly (-14.02 ± 11.67;  < 0.0001), with a larger effect in individuals with T2DM (-19.15 ± 11.0;  < 0.0001;  = 0.002 compared to non-diabetic subjects). Body mass index (BMI) decreased by -1.51 ± 0.82 kg/m, and 49.9% of the subjects lost ≥5% body weight. After fasting, nearly half of the 264 subjects with FLI ≥ 60 (highest risk category) shifted to a lower category. The improvement of FLI correlated with the number of fasting days (r = -0.20,  < 0.0001) and with the magnitude of BMI reduction (r = 0.14,  = 0.0001). Periodic fasting with concomitant weight reduction leads to significant rapid improvement of FLI in subjects with and without T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659239>Uncarboxylated osteocalcin ameliorates hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in KKAy mice via activating insulin signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Osteocalcin, expressed in osteoblasts of the bone marrow, undergoes post-translational carboxylation and deposits in mineralized bone matrix. A portion of osteocalcin remains uncarboxylated (uncarboxylated osteocalcin, GluOC) that is released into blood where it functions as a hormone to regulate insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. As insulin resistance is closely associated with metabolic syndrome, this study is aimed to elucidate how GluOC regulates glucose and lipid metabolism in KKAy mice, an animal model displaying obese, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. GluOC (3, 30 ng/g per day, ig) was orally administered to female KKAy mice for 4 weeks. Whole-body insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia were examined using routine laboratory assays. We found that GluOC administration significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity in KKAy mice by activating hepatic IRβ/PI3K/Akt pathway and elevated the whole-body insulin sensitivity with decreased FPI and HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, GluOC administration alleviated hyperglycemia through suppressing gluconeogenesis and promoting glycogen synthesis in KKAy mice and in cultured hepatocytes in vitro. Moreover, GluOC administration dose-dependently ameliorated dyslipidemia and attenuated hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice by inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis and promoting -acid β-oxidation. These results demonstrate that GluOC effectively enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity, improves hyperglycemia and ameliorates hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice, suggesting that GluOC could be a promising drug candidate for treating metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638172>The A3 adenosine receptor agonist, namodenoson, ameliorates non‑alcoholic steatohepatitis in mice.</a></h2><p>The Wnt/β‑catenin pathway confers a chain of molecular events in livers affected by non‑alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Namodenoson, a selective agonist of the A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR), which is highly expressed in pathological  cells, induces a robust anti‑inflammatory effect in the , mediated via the de‑regulation of the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway. Namodenoson also acts as a  protective agent by inhibiting ischemia/reperfusion injury. Based on these unique characteristics, we investigated the anti‑NASH effect of Namodenoson in murine models of steatohepatitis and in the LX2 human hepatic stellate cell line (HSC). In the STAM model, Namodenoson significantly decreased the non‑alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) activity score, NAS, demonstrating anti‑inflammatory and anti‑steatotic effects. In the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) model, Namodenoson reversed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to normal values and significantly improved  inflammation and fibrosis, as well as the adiponectin and leptin levels. Namodenoson de‑regulated the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway in the  extracts of the CCl4 model mice and in the LX2 HSCs, manifested by a decrease in the expression of phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K), nuclear factor κ‑light‑chain‑enhancer of activated B cells (NF‑κB), β‑catenin, lymphoid enhancer‑binding factor 1 (Lef‑1) and cyclin D1, and an increase in the expression level of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK‑3β). The fibrosis marker, α‑smooth muscle actin (α‑SMA) was also de‑regulated, supporting the anti‑fibrotic effect of Namodenoson. On the whole, the findings of this study demonstrate that Namodenoson exerts an anti‑NASH effect mediated via the de‑regulation of the PI3K/NF‑κB/Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway.

Primary analyses were performed on the three cohorts and secondary analyses on subcohorts including patients with NAFLD diagnosis code (N = 6599). Case/outcome definitions were formulated with International Classification of Diseases/Read codes/laboratory results and classified using validated algorithms. Adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) were estimated with a Poisson regression model.When comparing the T2DM+HBV and T2DM cohorts, adjusted IRRs were 14.06 (95% confidence interval: 4.47-44.19) for cirrhosis and 2.83 (1.06-7.55) for HCC. When comparing the T2DM+HBV and HBV cohorts, adjusted IRRs were 0.68 (0.21-2.27) for cirrhosis and 1.39 (0.46-4.20) for HCC. No cirrhosis cases were identified in T2DM+NAFLD+HBV patients; IRs were 16.92/10 000 person-years (12.97-21.69) and 85.24/10 000 person-years (10.32-307.91) in the T2DM+NAFLD and NAFLD+HBV cohorts.HBV-infection increased significantly the risk for cirrhosis among T2DM patients, however, not beyond the expected incremental risk among infected non-T2DM subjects.

Currently, there are no reliable biomarkers or effective therapeutic options established for NAFLD. Nevertheless, there are several molecular targets in the pipeline, of which fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is one. FGF21 is secreted primarily from  and has a plethora of metabolic functions. Pre-clinical and epidemiological studies indicate a relationship between circulating FGF21 levels and hepatic fat content in both mice and humans. Moreover, animal studies have clearly shown that aberrant FGF21 signalling is a key pathological step in the development and progression of NAFLD. A recent Phase II clinical trial demonstrated that administration of an FGF21 analogue significantly reduced hepatic fat in subjects with NASH. As such, FGF21 provides a novel target for future biomarker and therapeutic studies. This review appraises preclinical data to outline the current understanding of FGF21 function in both normal hepatic function and NAFLD. Epidemiological evidence is explored to delineate the relationship between circulating FGF21 levels and NAFLD in humans.

It is usually associated with elevated  enzymes and ranges from simple steatosis to  cirrhosis. This study was conducted to compare the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) versus aerobic interval training (AIT) exercise and how they affect  functions in people suffering from nonalcoholic .  This study was carried out on 50 female patients suffering from NAFLD with age ranging from 30 to 55 years; they were randomly divided into two equal groups: group A received (EA) stimulation at points of  3 (LR3),  14 (LR14), gall bladder 34 (GB34), and stomach 36 (ST36), whereas group B received AIT exercise. All patients in both groups A and B received 3 sessions per week for 6 weeks (receiving noninterrupted 18 sessions) in addition to their standard medications. Evaluation of all patients in both groups A and B was carried out before and after the treatment program by measuring the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), triglycerides (TGs), and C-reactive protein (CRP).  There is a significant decrease ( < 0.05) of ALT, AST, TGs, and CRP within each group, A and B, after 6 weeks of treatment sessions. A significant difference post-treatment was found between both groups in ALT, AST, and TGs ( < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in CRP ( > 0.05) between both groups post-treatment.

We investigated whether Protease-Activated Receptor 2 (PAR2) plays a role in cholesterol and lipid homeostasis in NAFLD.Human  biopsies (n = 108) were quantified for PAR2 expression from NAFLD cases randomly selected and stratified by  fibrosis stage, the primary predictor for clinical outcomes, while controlling for age, gender, and BMI between fibrosis groups. Demographic data and laboratory studies on plasma samples were obtained within 6 months of  biopsy. Wild-type and PAR2-KO (C57BL/6 F2rl1) mice were fed either normal or high fat diet for 16 weeks and plasma and  assayed for lipids and soluble metabolites.Severity of NAFLD and plasma cholesterol levels significantly correlated with hepatocyte PAR2 expression in NAFLD patients. Conversely, PAR2 deficiency in mice resulted in reduced expression of key hepatic genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, a 50% drop in plasma and total  cholesterol, and induced a reverse cholesterol transport system that culminated in 25% higher fecal bile acid output. PAR2-deficient mice exhibited enhanced  acid β-oxidation with a ketogenic shift and an unexpected increase in  glycogenesis. Mechanistic studies identified G-Jnk1/2 as key downstream effectors of protease-activated PAR2 in the regulation of lipid and cholesterol homeostasis in .These data indicate that PAR2 may be a new target for the suppression of plasma cholesterol and hepatic fat accumulation in NAFLD and related metabolic conditions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

High fat/high sucrose (HFHS) diet-induced insulin resistance is implicated in multiple metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD), these metabolic diseases has become epidemic health issue worldwide. In this study, the effect of C. lanceolata polysaccharide (CLPS) on improving insulin sensitivity in chronic HFHS diet-fed mice was investigated. Our data indicates that CLPS significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting serum insulin (FINS) and insulin resistance index, in parallel with improved glucose and insulin tolerance impaired by HFHS diet. Impaired phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and hyperphosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser307 were observed in the mice fed with HFHS diet, and those defects were also rescued by CLPS administration. In addition, CLPS caused a significant decrease in the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), and an increase in reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidised glutathione (GSSG) ratio; concurrent with enhanced expression of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and activated Nrf2 signaling. In summary, these findings suggest that CLPS ameliorates HFHS diet-induced insulin resistance through activating anti-oxidative signaling pathway, providing new insights into the protective effects of C. lanceolata polysaccharide in metabolic disease.Copyright © 2019.

For this purpose, we established a NAFLD model by feeding C57BL/6J mice a methionine‑choline‑​deficient diet. Antagomir‑21 was then injected via the tail vein, and the expression levels of WNT/β‑catenin signaling pathway‑related proteins, such as LRP6, glycogen synthase kinase‑3β (GSK3β), p‑β‑catenin, β‑catenin and the downstream protein, peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor γ (PPAR‑γ), and lipid metabolism‑related genes, including sterol regulatory element‑binding transcription factor 1c (SREBP1c),  acid synthase (FAS), carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1α (CPT1α) and adenosine 5‑monophosphate (AMP)‑activated protein kinase α (AMPKα), were detected. The results revealed that in the NAFLD model, LRP6 expression was negatively associated with miR‑21 expression. After antagonizing the expression of miR‑21, the protein level of LRP6 was increased. In addition, the WNT/β‑catenin signaling pathway was activated, and lipid accumulation and inflammation were alleviated in the . However, the expression of PPAR‑γ was not inhibited following the upregulation of the WNT signaling pathway.

NAFL (non-alcoholic ) is now, with the prevalence of 40 %, the most common  disease in Western countries. Despite that NAFL has usually no symptoms and in most patients, it is diagnosed as an incidental finding by abdominal ultra-sound, every third of these patients develops NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), resulting in an individual progression of the sequence of fibrosis - cirrhosis - hepatocellular carcinoma. Due to the fact, that NASH is, along with the cardiovascular causes, involved in -related mortality of patients with the metabolic syndrome, from clinical view, it is fundamental to distinguish between benign NAFL and potentially progressive NASH. This appears even more serious realizing that patients with NASH are being often underdiagnosed because of limited indications of  biopsy, a common diagnostically gold standard. This work emphasizes the relationship between metabolic syndrome and  disease and presents the main diagnostic possibilities of NAFL/NASH, the most dealing with serum markers. It is based on a research, using the PubMed database and putting the key words as search terms. Considering the huge number of patients diagnosed with , a non-invasive, widely approachable method should be established, to make the diagnostic and staging of progression of NASH broadly possible.

Finally, we point out that earlier identification of patients with NAFLD should be pursued by increasing awareness of the association of these two phenotypes and collaboration between the involved physicians.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The inhibition of lipid accumulation is regarded as a potential treatment for NAFLD. In this study, we investigated the effects of γ-mangostin or α-mangostin on lipid accumulation in a cell model. Analysis of the inhibitory effects of γ-mangostin on lipid accumulation revealed that it downregulated NAFLD-related biochemical parameters and stimulated the SIRT1/LKB1/AMPK pathway. Consequently, it suppressed lipid synthesis and enhanced  acid oxidation. Moreover, we demonstrated that the blockage of AMPK by the pharmacological inhibitor Compound C abrogated the promoting effect of AMPK. Similar results were also observed for α-mangostin. The effects of α-mangostin on lipid accumulation were inferior to those of γ-mangostin. The differences in CPT1A activity might be originated from their different chemical structures. Our results suggested that γ-mangostin and α-mangostin can be exploited as a potential candidate for NAFLD treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652578>The SGLT2 Inhibitor Canagliflozin Prevents Carcinogenesis in a Mouse Model of Diabetes and Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis-Related Hepatocarcinogenesis: Association with SGLT2 Expression in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of canagliflozin, a selective sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, on non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and NASH-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a mouse model of diabetes and NASH-HCC. First, mice aged five weeks were divided into two groups (vehicle group and canagliflozin group) and were treated for three weeks. Then, mice aged five weeks were divided into three groups of nine animals each: the vehicle group, early canagliflozin group (treated from five to nine weeks), and continuous canagliflozin group (treated from five to 16 weeks). Canagliflozin was administered at a dose of 30 mg/kg in these experiments. In addition, the in vitro effects of canagliflozin were investigated using HepG2 cells, a human HCC cell line. At the age of eight or 16 weeks, the histological non-alcoholic  disease activity score was lower in the canagliflozin-treated mice than in vehicle-treated mice. There were significantly fewer hepatic tumors in the continuous canagliflozin group than in the vehicle group. Immunohistochemistry showed significantly fewer glutamine synthetase-positive nodules in the continuous canagliflozin group than in the vehicle group. Expression of α-fetoprotein mRNA, a marker of HCC, was downregulated in the continuous canagliflozin group when compared with the vehicle group. At 16 weeks, there was diffuse SGLT1 expression in the hepatic lobules and strong expression by hepatocytes in the vehicle group, while SGLT2 expression was stronger in  tumors than in the lobules. In the in vitro study, canagliflozin (10 μM) suppressed the proliferation of HepG2 cells. Flow cytometry showed that canagliflozin reduced the percentage of HepG2 cells in the G2/M phase due to arrest in the G1 phase along with decreased expression of cyclin D and Cdk4 proteins, while it increased the percentage of cells in the G0/1 phase. Canagliflozin also induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells via activation of caspase 3. In this mouse model of diabetes and NASH/HCC, canagliflozin showed anti-steatotic and anti-inflammatory effects that attenuated the development of NASH and prevented the progression of NASH to HCC, partly due to the induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis as well as the reduction of tumor growth through the direct inhibition of SGLT2 in tumor cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625900>[Dysfunctions of mitochondrial  acid β-oxidation in rare and common diseases].</a></h2><p>Dysfunctions of mitochondrial  acid ß-oxidation (ß-FAO) in various tissues represent a hallmark of many common disorders, and are acknowledged to play an essential role in the pathogenesis of diabetes, obesity, and cardiac diseases. Moreover, inborn defects in ß-FAO form a large family of rare diseases with variable phenotypes, ranging from fatal multi-organ failure in the newborn to isolated adult onset myopathy. These pathologies highlight the critical role of ß-FAO in many tissues with high-energy demand (heart, muscle, , kidney). Furthermore, and unexpectedly, very recent data unveiled the possible involvement of ß-FAO in instructing complex non energy-related functions, such as chromatin modification, control of neural stem cell activity, or survival and fate of cancer cells. Pharmacological targeting of ß-FAO by small molecules might therefore open new avenues for the treatment of various rare or common diseases.© 2019 médecine/sciences – Inserm.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647808>Causal relationships between obesity and the leading causes of death in women and men.</a></h2><p>Obesity traits are causally implicated with risk of cardiometabolic diseases. It remains unclear whether there are similar causal effects of obesity traits on other non-communicable diseases. Also, it is largely unexplored whether there are any sex-specific differences in the causal effects of obesity traits on cardiometabolic diseases and other leading causes of death. We constructed sex-specific genetic risk scores (GRS) for three obesity traits; body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and WHR adjusted for BMI, including 565, 324, and 337 genetic variants, respectively. These GRSs were then used as instrumental variables to assess associations between the obesity traits and leading causes of mortality in the UK Biobank using Mendelian randomization. We also investigated associations with potential mediators, including smoking, glycemic and blood pressure traits. Sex-differences were subsequently assessed by Cochran's Q-test (Phet). A Mendelian randomization analysis of 228,466 women and 195,041 men showed that obesity causes coronary artery disease, stroke (particularly ischemic), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, type 2 and 1 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic  disease, chronic  disease, and acute and chronic renal failure. Higher BMI led to higher risk of type 2 diabetes in women than in men (Phet = 1.4×10-5). Waist-hip-ratio led to a higher risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Phet = 3.7×10-6) and higher risk of chronic renal failure (Phet = 1.0×10-4) in men than women. Obesity traits have an etiological role in the majority of the leading global causes of death. Sex differences exist in the effects of obesity traits on risk of type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal failure, which may have downstream implications for public health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626206>[Evaluation of the effect of remaxol on hepatocytes in non-alcoholic  dystrophy modeling in laboratory C57BL/6 mice].</a></h2><p>To provide a morphological evaluation of the effectiveness of incorporating remaxol into a treatment regimen for non-alcoholic  disease.The investigation was conducted using 32 male C57BL/6 mice weighing 35-44 g, which were divided into 4 groups. In Group 1, eight mice were fed with a standard diet for 75 days; the animals from Groups 2 and 3 received a hypercaloric diet for the same period of time. The mice from Group 2 were euthanized immediately after the diet was stopped; and Group 3 was switched to the standard diet after 20 days of the recovery period. Group 4 included the mice that were, after a 75-day hypercaloric diet, were injected with remaxol at a dose of 25 ml/kg once daily every other day; the cycle consisted of 10 injections.  tissues were morphologically evaluated using Oil Red O-stained tissue specimens additionally stained with Mayer's hematoxylin on the cryostat sections applying a Zeiss Axio Imager. A2 microscope equipped with an Axiocam 506 color camera. The photographed images were processed using the ZEN 2.3 program ('Carl Zeiss', Germany).The morphological equivalent of  improvement in mice that were injected and were not injected with remaxol was found to be normalization of the lobular structure, preservation of the structure and intralobular orientation of the hepatic tubules, and restoration of the width of the sinusoidal lumen. The degree of infiltration was much lesser than that in the group of experimental animals that did not additionally receive the drug.These histological signs may suggest that remaxol is effective in treating non-alcoholic  disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640183>Water Extract of  L. Ameliorates Non-Alcoholic  Disease.</a></h2><p>Our aim was to investigate whether hot water extract (CLW) of  L. could prevent non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). HepG2 cells were treated with free  acid (FFA) mixture (oleic acid: palmitic acid, 2:1) for 24 h to stimulate in vitro . In addition, C57BL/6 mice were fed 60 kcal% high-fat (HF) diet for eight weeks to induce  in vivo. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) productions were increased by FFA and HF-diet, but supplementation with CLW significantly decreased these levels. CLW treatment ameliorated antioxidant activities that were suppressed by exposure to the FFA and HF-diet. Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and  acid transport proteins (FATP2 and FATP5) were increased in HF-diet groups, while CLW suppressed their expression levels. Moreover, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), and  acid synthase (FAS) expression levels were down-regulated in the CLW groups compared to HF-diet groups. On the other hand, 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1) expressions were up-regulated in the CLW groups. HF-diet fed mice showed high hepatic triglycerides (TG) content compared to the normal diet mice. However, the administration of CLW restored the hepatic TG level, indicating an inhibitory effect against lipid accumulation by CLW. These results suggest that CLW could be a potentially useful agent for the prevention of NAFLD through modulating  acid uptake.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656291>The Effect of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy on Obesity and Obesity-related Disease : the Results of 10 Initial Cases.</a></h2><p>Introduction : The number of patients who undergo laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has been increasing.

Results of a multicentric, double-blind, randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>To investigate the perioperative use of Omega-3 polyunsaturated  acids (Ω3-FA) to reduce post-operative complications after  surgery.In a variety of animal models, Ω3-FA disclosed strong protective effects in alleviating hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury and steatosis with enhancement of regeneration after major tissue loss. Given these benefits along with its safety profile, we hypothesized that perioperative administration of Ω3-FA in patients undergoing  surgery may ameliorate the post-operative course.A multi-centric, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was designed to test whether two single intravenous infusions of Omegaven (Ω3-FA) vs. placebo may decrease morbidity. The primary endpoints were postoperative complications by severity (Clavien-Dindo classification) integrated in the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI).Between July 2013 and July 2018, 261 patients (132 in the Omegaven and 129 in the placebo groups) were included in the trial from three centers. Most cases (87%, n=227) underwent open  surgery and 56% (n=105) were major resections (≥3 segments). In an intention-to-treat analysis including the drop out cases, the mortality rate was 4% and 2% in the OmegavenTM and placebo groups (P=0.447; OR: 95%CI: 0.04-2.51), respectively. Any complications and major complications (Clavien-Dindo ≥3b) occurred in 46% vs. 43% (P=0.709) and 12% vs. 10% (P=0.69) in the Omegaven and placebo groups, respectively. The mean CCI was 17 (±23) vs.14 (±20) (P=0.417). An analysis excluding the drop-outs provided similar figures.The routine perioperative use of two single doses of intravenous Ω3-FA (100ml Omegaven) cannot be recommended in patients undergoing  surgery (Grade A recommendation).This trial fails to detect an effect on the use of two single Omega-3  acid infusions before and during  surgery to reduce complications. Despite strong evidence of -directed anti-inflammatory and pro-regenerative action in various rodent models, this trial fails to confer  protection with single Omega-3  acid infusions and is therefore currently not recommended.Copyright © 2019.

NAFLD is associated with type 2 diabetes, obesity and genetic factors and includes a spectrum of potentially progressive  disease that comprises of simple steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), variable degree of fibrosis and, ultimately, cirrhosis. Simple steatosis has been considered a benign condition, while the progression to fibrosis and advanced  disease is related to NASH development. While steatosis is diagnosed by routine imaging methods, NASH could be diagnosed only by  biopsy. Life style modification and weight reduction is the method of choice in the treatment of NAFLD. Despite intensive effort, no pharmacological treatment of NAFLD has been approved; based on the results of clinical trials the use of vitamin E or pioglitazone could be considered in the treatment of bioptically proved NASH. New antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory agents for the treatment of NASH are under evaluation.

Similar study was done in the normal glucose tolerance and prediabetes groups separately. These parameters were then compared with those of 75 matched diabetic teetotallers with NAFLD. To analyse further the difference between normal glucose tolerance, prediabetic and overt diabetic groups, binary logistic regression of the factors was carried out taking prediabetes and diabetes as outcome variable.All the metabolic parameters were significantly higher in diabetics compared to non diabetics and in prediabetics compared to those with normal glucose tolerance except high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and BMI significantly predicted NFS in the overall (adjusted R2 68.7%, P=0.000) and normal glucose tolerance groups (adjusted R2 73.2%, P=0.000) whereas BMI, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and HbA1c did in prediabetics (adjusted R2 89%, P=0.000).

Electron microscopic images confirmed the synthesis of almost spherical shaped biogenic silver nanoparticles (bAgNPs). The zeta potentials of the nanoparticles were negative and were -22 and -26 mV for Aq-bAgNPs and Et-bAgNPs, respectively. The antibacterial activity of bAgNPs was investigated against seven pathogenic (i.e., enteropathogenic ) and three nonpathogenic (i.e.,  DH5α,  K12, and ) bacteria at different time points (i.e., 12, 16, 20, and 24 h) in a dose-dependent manner (i.e., 20, 40, and 60 μg) through broth dilution assay, disk diffusion assay, CellTox Green uptake assay, and trypan blue dye exclusion assay. The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration value for both the bAgNPs was 0.125 μg. Et-bAgNPs showed the highest antibacterial activity against  at 60 μg after 16 h and the diameter of inhibited zone was 28 mm. Lipid peroxidation assay using all the bacterial strains revealed the formation of malondialdehyde-thiobarbituric acid adduct due to the oxidation of cell membrane  acids by bAgNPs. The bAgNPs showed excellent hemocompatibility against human as well as rat red blood cells.

To describe MetS and its determinants among apparently healthy individuals residing in urban and rural communities in Egypt and to establish a model for MetS prediction.  A cross-sectional study was conducted with 270 adults from rural and urban districts in Alexandria, Egypt.

The risk of ischemic heart diseases (IHDs), DM and  were assessed using validated risk prediction charts. A multiple risk model for predicting MetS was developed, and its performance was compared.  In total, 57.8% of the study population met the criteria for MetS and were at high risk for developing IHD, DM, and . Silent CVD risk factors were identified in 20.4% of the participants. In our proposed multivariate logistic regression model, the predictors of MetS were obesity [OR (95% CI) = 16.3 (6.03-44.0)], morbid obesity [OR (95% CI) = 21.7 (5.3-88.0)], not working [OR (95% CI) = 2.05 (1.1-3.8)], and having a family history of chronic diseases [OR (95% CI) = 4.38 (2.23-8.61)].

In , genetic or acquired impairment of mtDNA homeostasis can reduce ATP output but also decrease  acid oxidation, thus leading to different hepatic lesions including massive necrosis and microvesicular steatosis. Hence, a severe impairment of mtDNA homeostasis can lead to  failure and death. An increasing number of investigations report that some drugs can induce mitochondrial dysfunction and drug-induced  injury (DILI) by altering mtDNA homeostasis. Some drugs such as ciprofloxacin, antiretroviral nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and tacrine can inhibit hepatic mtDNA replication, thus inducing mtDNA depletion. Drug-induced reduced mtDNA levels can also be the consequence of reactive oxygen species-mediated oxidative damage to mtDNA, which triggers its degradation by mitochondrial nucleases. Such mechanism is suspected for acetaminophen and troglitazone. Other pharmaceuticals such as linezolid and tetracyclines can impair mtDNA translation, thus selectively reducing the synthesis of the 13 mtDNA-encoded proteins. Lastly, some drugs might alter the mtDNA methylation status but the pathophysiological consequences of such alteration are still unclear. Drug-induced impairment of mtDNA homeostasis is probably under-recognized since preclinical and post-marketing safety studies do not classically investigate mtDNA levels, mitochondrial protein synthesis and mtDNA oxidative damage.Copyright © 2019.

Fibrates are derivatives of fibric acid. Therapy with fibrates in humans leads to a lowering of serum very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels leading to decreases in triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Several fibrates have also been found to decrease low density lipoprotein (LDL) and increase high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, but their effects are, in general, less than what can be achieved with the statins. The fibrates are currently used largely in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and are used in combination with statins to treat hypercholesterolemia. The mechanism by which the fibrates lower lipid levels is unknown, but they may act through interactions with the hepatic peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) which regulate gene transcription of enzymes involved in lipid synthesis and secretion.

Hepatic fat was measured by proton MRS, insulin sensitivity index (SI) calculated by minimal modeling from a frequently-sampled intravenous glucose test, RBC  acid profiles by gas chromatography were used to estimate SCD-1 indices. Hepatic fat, S, and SCD-1 were similar in black women and lower than in whites, regardless of menopausal status. Fasting and postprandial large, medium and small TRLPs, but not very small TRLPs, were lower in black women. Fasting large, medium and very small TRLPs negatively correlated with S and positively correlated with visceral and hepatic fat, and SCD-1 activity in both groups. In multivariate models, visceral fat and SCD-1 were associated with total fasting TRLP concentrations (adjR= 0.39, P=0.001). Black women had smaller postprandial changes in large (P=0.005) and medium TRLPs (P=0.007).  Lower visceral fat and SCD-1 activity may contribute to the paradoxical association of lower fasting and postprandial TRLP subfractions despite insulin resistance in black compared to white pre- and post-menopausal women. Similar concentrations of very small TRLPs are related to insulin resistance and could be important mediators of cardiometabolic disease risk in women.  .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668723>Dietary n-6 to n-3  acid ratio is related to  fat content independent of genetic effects: Evidence from the monozygotic co-twin control design.</a></h2><p>Lifestyle changes focusing on diet and exercise remain the cornerstone of the treatment of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD).

The ARBs in clinical use in the United States include eight agents of similar chemical structure and activity, but somewhat different pharmacokinetics: losartan (Cozaar: 1995), valsartan (Diovan: 1996), irbesartan (Avapro: 1997), eprosartan (Teveten: 1997), candesartan (Atacand: 1998), telmisartan (Micardis: 1998), olmesartan (Benicar: 2002) and azilsartan (Edarbi: 2011). All of these agents have been associated with a minimal rate of serum enzyme elevations during chronic therapy (0.2% to 2%) which are usually mild-to-moderate in severity, self limited, and rarely require dose modification or discontinuation. As a class, the ARBs have been associated with rare instances of acute  injury that is usually self limited in duration, but varies in clinical expression, being usually hepatocellular but occasional cholestatic in nature. The most common presentation of  injury due to these agents is a cholestatic hepatitis arising within 1 to 8 weeks of starting and resolving as rapidly with stopping. Rare instances of prolonged jaundice have been described but not acute  failure or autoimmune chronic hepatitis. Several Individual case reports of clinically apparent  injury have been published in the literature for losartan, valsartan, irbesartan olmesartan and candesartan, but not specifically for azilsartan, eprosartan, and telmisartan, probably because these three have been in use for a shorter period of time and in fewer subjects. Most ARBs and particularly olmesartan have been linked to rare instances of severe sprue-like enteropathy. The enteropathy typically presents with severe diarrhea and weight loss with variable degrees of fatigue, nausea and abdominal discomfort arising 6 months to many years after starting the ARB. Small intestinal histological findings resemble those of celiac disease with flattening of the duodenal villuous pattern and villous atrophy. However, anti-transglutaminase and endomysial antibodies (the serologic markers of celiac disease) are negative and there is little or no response to a gluten-free diet. Withdrawal of the ARB, however, results in prompt improvement in the diarrhea and gradual resolution of duodenal villous flattening. Some cases of this drug induced enteropathy have had accompanying serum aminotransferase elevations and  by imaging or  biopsy, which, along with the diarrhea, resolve rapidly with stopping the medication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672551>Fasting reveals largely intact systemic lipid mobilization mechanisms in respiratory chain complex III deficient mice.</a></h2><p>Mice homozygous for the human GRACILE syndrome mutation (Bcs1l) display decreased respiratory chain complex III activity,  dysfunction, hypoglycemia, rapid loss of white adipose tissue and early death. To assess the underlying mechanism of the lipodystrophy in homozygous mice (Bcs1l), these and wild-type control mice were subjected to a short 4-hour fast. The homozygotes had low baseline blood glucose values, but a similar decrease in response to fasting as in wild-type mice, resulting in hypoglycemia in the majority. Despite the already depleted glycogen and increased triacylglycerol content in the mutant livers, the mice responded to fasting by further depletion and increase, respectively. Increased plasma free  acids (FAs) upon fasting suggested normal capacity for mobilization of lipids from white adipose tissue into circulation. Strikingly, however, serum glycerol concentration was not increased concomitantly with free FAs, suggesting its rapid uptake into the  and utilization for fuel or gluconeogenesis in the mutants. The mutant hepatocyte mitochondria were capable of responding to fasting by appropriate morphological changes, as analyzed by electron microscopy, and by increasing respiration. Mutants showed increased hepatic gene expression of major metabolic controllers typically associated with fasting response (Ppargc1a, Fgf21, Cd36) already in the fed state, suggesting a chronic starvation-like metabolic condition. Despite this, the mutant mice responded largely normally to fasting by increasing hepatic respiration and switching to FA utilization, indicating that the mechanisms driving these adaptations are not compromised by the CIII dysfunction. SUMMARY STATEMENT: Bcs1l mutant mice with severe CIII deficiency, energy deprivation and post-weaning lipolysis respond to fasting similarly to wild-type mice, suggesting largely normal systemic lipid mobilization and utilization mechanisms.Copyright © 2019.

Thus, here, we aimed to perform a meta-analysis on NAFLD prevalence in the lean or nonobese population to give clarity.PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched to identify studies reporting NAFLD prevalence in the lean/nonobese population. Lean or nonobese was defined by body mass index cutoffs reported by authors in original studies. NAFLD prevalence based on community, population, or health checkups was combined with random-effect model after logit transformation. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were further performed to investigate the heterogenicity.A total of 45 studies were enrolled in the final analysis, with 55,936 lean/nonobese subjects included, among whom 7351 NAFLD patients were diagnosed. Overall, the pooled NAFLD prevalence of the lean or nonobese population was 10.2% (95% confidence interval: 7.6%-13.6%) and 15.7% (95% confidence interval: 12.5%-19.6%), respectively. Compared with western studies, the NAFLD prevalence in the lean or nonobese population was lower in eastern studies. In addition, the NAFLD prevalence in both the lean and nonobese population showed a general upward trend during recent years. The prevalence was similar in community-based and health checkup-based studies. Lean/nonobese NAFLD patients had significantly lower rates of hypertension, lower uric acid and fasting plasma glucose, and a higher level of high-density lipoprotein than nonlean/obese patients.The prevalence of NAFLD in the lean/nonobese population is not rare in either the western or eastern regions of the world. This meta-analysis of prevalence assessment and clinical characteristics should enable higher confidence in more specific interventions and health care standards for these patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630414>First-in-class  acid synthase inhibitor TVB-2640 reduces hepatic de novo lipogenesis in males with metabolic abnormalities.</a></h2><p>Elevated hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is a key distinguishing characteristic of nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In rodent models of NAFLD, treatment with a surrogate of TVB-2640, a pharmacological inhibitor of FAS (FASi), has been shown to reduce hepatic fat and other biomarkers of DNL. The purpose of this Phase I clinical study was to test the effect of the TVB-2640 in obese men with certain metabolic abnormalities that put them at risk for NAFLD. Twelve subjects (mean±SE, 42±2y, BMI 37.4±1.2 kg/m , glucose 103±2 mg/dL, TG 196±27 mg/dL, and elevated  enzymes) underwent 10 days of treatment with TVB-2640 at doses ranging from 50-150 mg/d. Food intake was controlled throughout the study. Hepatic DNL was measured before and after an oral fructose/glucose (F/G) bolus using isotopic labeling with 1- C -acetate IV infusion, followed by measurement of labeled VLDL-palmitate via GC/MS. Substrate oxidation was measured by indirect calorimetry. Across the range of doses, fasting DNL was reduced by up to 90% (P=0.003). Increasing plasma concentrations of TVB-2640 were associated with progressive reductions in the percent of fructose-stimulated peak fractional DNL (R = - 0.749, P=0.0003) and absolute DNL AUC 6h post F/G bolus (R = - 0.409, P=0.025). For all subjects combined, ALT was reduced by 15.8±8.4% (P=0.05). Substrate oxidation was unchanged and safety monitoring revealed that the drug was well tolerated, without an increase in plasma triglycerides. Alopecia occurred in two subjects (reversed after stopping the drug), but otherwise no changes were observed in fasting glucose, insulin, ketones, and renal function. These data support the therapeutic potential of FASi, TVB-2640 in particular, in patients with NAFLD and NASH.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of  Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625959>Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance closely related to lobular inflammation in nonalcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance (IR) has been established as a major risk factor for nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) where it exerts effects on plasma glucose homeostasis, cellular anabolism, and organ glucose uptake. Owing to paucity of studies focused on peripheral IR in relation to pathological outcome, we aim to investigate homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) by histological characteristics of NAFLD. biopsy of 588 patients was screened. After excluding etiologies other than NAFLD and factors contributing to IR, serum HOMA-IR was compared with patients' histologic features. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess their relationship. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) was calculated to assess the discriminatory ability of homeostatic model assessment of IR for advanced lobular inflammation (LI).We observed higher serum level of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and low-density lipoprotein as HOMA-IR increased. HOMA-IR is significantly associated with severity of LI (odds ratio = 1.222, 95% confidence interval = 1.135-1.315, P < 0.001), similar association remained after adjusting for age, BMI, hemoglobin A1c, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides (odds ratio = 1.205, 95% confidence interval = 1.102-1.317, P < 0.001). HOMA-IR is discriminant of LI with AUROC = 0.832 and cutoff = 2.995 (sensitivity = 0.938, specificity = 0.569).This study demonstrated a strong and independent association of HOMA-IR with the severity of  inflammation by histological evaluation in NAFLD patients without diabetes or metabolic syndrome, and its possible role in diagnosis of LI could be translated into clinical assessment of NAFLD patients with uncertainty of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646583>Key molecular pathways in the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) has become the most common chronic  disease worldwide and also become an emerging risk factor for -related complications, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The -related burden of NASH is likely to increase and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is probably to be the leading indication for  transplantation by 2020, as a consequence of increased disease prevalence and of the lack of an effective treatment. The first step in the NAFLD development is represented by fat accumulation in the , a condition that is commonly associated with features of the metabolic syndrome. Notably, it has been acknowledged that the step from nonalcoholic  (NAFL) to NASH is key step in the NASH formation, and the mechanisms behind this transition have been extensively studied. Emerging evidence indicates that innate immunity is a driving force in NAFLD progression because it directly regulates all key pathogenic features of the disease processes, including metabolic dysregulation, inflammation, and fibrosis. In this review, we summarize the currently available signaling pathways of NASH formation, including oxidative stress, NOD-like receptors (NLRs), mitochondria-associated pathways, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nuclear receptors, and other signal pathways, for the aim of a better understanding of this disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633652> Transplantation for Propionic Acidemia: A Multi-center Linked Database Analysis.</a></h2><p>Propionic Acidemia (PA) is a rare inborn error of metabolism resulting from deficiency in the enzyme necessary for catabolism of branched-chain amino acids, some odd chain  acids and cholesterol. Despite optimal medical management, PA often leads to acute and progressive neurological injury. Reports on  transplantation (LT) as a cellular therapy are limited and varied. The objective of this study was to examine the largest collection of patients who underwent LT for PA.Examining the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and the Pediatric Health Information System administrative billing databases, we performed a multicenter, retrospective analysis of LT over a 16-year period. During this period, 4849 pediatric LT were performed out of which 23 were done for PA at 10 different centers.The majority of recipients were 5 years of age or younger and had status 1b exception points at the time of transplant. The 1-, 3-, and 5- year graft survival for PA LT recipients was 84.6% and the 1-, 3, and 5- year patient survival was 89.5%. There was no significant difference in graft or patient survival between PA and non-PA LT recipients. Despite historical data to the contrary, we did not find an increased incidence of hepatic arterial thrombosis in patients undergoing LT for PA. Patients in the PA LT group, however, had a significantly higher post-operative rate of readmission compared to the non-PA LT group (90.5% vs. 72.8%, p = 0.021).LT for children with PA is a viable treatment option with acceptable outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637346>Nonalcoholic  Disease in Nonobese Subjects of African Origin Has Atypical Metabolic Characteristics.</a></h2><p>Nonobese nonalcoholic  disease is reported in several populations. However, because persons of African origin display unique fat accumulation, insulin resistance, and lipid profiles, we investigated  in nonobese persons of African origin.We recruited 78 urban Jamaican volunteers. CT was used to estimate  and abdominal fat and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to measure body composition. Fasting blood was collected for lipids, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), adiponectin, and fetuin-A. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), whole-body insulin sensitivity index (WBISI), insulinogenic index (IGI), and oral disposition index (oDI) were calculated after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test.Fifty-two percent of participants were male; mean (±SD) age was 28.5 ± 7.8 years, and body mass index was 22.4 ± 3.0 kg/m. Mean  attenuation (MLA) and /spleen (LS) ratio, both inversely correlated to  fat, were 62.8 ± 4.3 HU and 1.2 ± 0.1, respectively; 3.8% of participants had  fat >30% (LS ratio < 1). In age, sex, and BMI-adjusted correlations, MLA was negatively associated with weight ( = -0.30;  = 0.009) and height ( = -0.28;  = 0.017) and was associated with fasting glucose ( = 0.23;  = 0.05), fasting insulin ( = 0.42;  ≤ 0.001) and HOMA-IR ( = 0.35;  = 0.004). Serum lipids, ALT, adiponectin, fetuin-A, WBISI, IGI, and oDI were not associated with  fat.In nonobese Afro-Caribbean participants, greater  fat was associated with weight and height and lower fasting insulin and hyperinsulinemia appears to be influential in the reduction of NAFLD.

However, the hypolipidemic effects and mechanism of rosemary ethanol extract (RO) and their metabolites are less known. In this study, the hypolipidemic effects of RO and its active compounds were clarified. The results showed that RO, rosmarinic acid (RA) and carnosic acid (CA) significantly reduced the contents of  triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), free  acids (FFA) and improved cell hypertrophy, vacuolation, and cell necrosis in the  of orotic acid induced non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) model rats. The mechanism and related pathways of RO and its main metabolites against lipid disorder were related to the up-regulation of the phosphorylation of adenosine 5'-monophosphate(AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the inhibition of the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) cracking into the nucleus, following the down-regulation of  acid synthesis. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that RA and CA are active substances of RO, and provides scientific evidence to support functional food product development for improving NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645505>Temporal changes in urinary excretion of -type  acid binding protein (L-FABP) in acute kidney injury model of domestic cats: a preliminary study.</a></h2><p>-type  acid-binding protein (L-FABP) is a biomarker for the early detection of renal diseases in humans. It is secreted along with cytotoxic oxidation products from proximal tubular epithelial cells under conditions of ischemia and/or oxidative stress. This study examined urinary L-FABP excretion under renal ischemia in feline acute kidney injury (AKI) model. L-FABP excretion increased immediately after renal ischemia/reperfusion, despite the absence of obvious structural damage to the kidneys, in the two AKI model cats studied. L-FABP was detected in the renal tubular lumen immediately after renal ischemia/reperfusion in the two cats, but not in a sham surgery cat. These results suggested that high L-FABP excretion is a pathophysiological response associated with antioxidant defense in proximal tubules with renal ischemia and/or oxidative stress in a feline model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628070>The relative expression of hepatocellular and cholestatic  enzymes in adult patients with  disease.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular  injury is characterized by elevations in serum alanine (ALT) and aspartate (AST) aminotransferases while cholestasis is associated with elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels. When both sets of enzymes are elevated, distinguishing between the two patterns of  disease can be difficult. The aim of this study was to document the predicted ranges of serum ALP values in patients with hepatocellular  injury and ALT or AST values in patients with cholestasis. enzyme levels were documented in adult patients with various types and degrees of hepatocellular (non-alcoholic  disease, hepatitis B and C, alcohol and autoimmune hepatitis) and cholestatic (primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis) disease.In 5167 hepatocellular disease patients with ALT (or AST) values that were normal, 1-5×, 5-10× or >10× elevated, median (95% CI) serum ALP levels were 0.64 (0.62-0.66), 0.72 (0.71-0.73), 0.80 (0.77-0.82) and 1.15 (1.0-1.22) fold elevated respectively. In 252 cholestatic patients with ALP values that were normal, 1-5× or >5× elevated, serum ALT (or AST) values were 1.13 (0.93-1.63), 2.47 (2.13-2.70) and 4.57 (3.27-5.63) fold elevated respectively. In 56 patients with concurrent diseases, ALP levels were beyond predicted values for their hepatitis in 38 (68%) and ALT (or AST) values beyond predicted values for their cholestatic disorder in 24 (43%).These data provide health care providers with predicted ranges of  enzymes in patients with hepatocellular or cholestatic  disease and may thereby help to identify patients with concurrent forms of  disease.Copyright © 2019 Fundación Clínica Médica Sur, A.C.

The aim of this study was to explore the molecular mechanisms of its role in non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD).NAFLD mouse models were established by using eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD) or (and) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 18 weeks. From the beginning of HFD, HFD-induced mice were subjected to amlexanox or vehicle for 18 weeks. HFD+LPS-induced mice were treated with amlexanox or vehicle for the last 6 weeks. Blood biochemistry parameters were determined using automatic biochemistry analyzer. Histological changes of  tissue were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and Oil Red O staining. The expressions of IKKε and smooth muscle actin-α (α-SMA) were evaluated through immunohistochemistry. Serum inflammatory mediator was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Gene expressions involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin signaling pathway were examined using quantitative RT-PCR or Western blotting.This study demonstrated that amlexanox reversed glucose and lipid metabolic disturbance and hepatic steatosis in NAFLD mice model. IKKε was specific expressed in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) instead of hepatocytes. This study also found that amlexanox improved insulin signaling (Insulin-IRS-1-Akt) in hepatocytes through inhibiting inflammation (IKKε-NF-κB-TNF-α/IL-1α) in HSCs.The present study confirmed that IKKε was specific expressed in HSCs. Inhibition of activated HSCs was responsible for effects of amlexanox on NAFLD, with improving insulin signal pathway in hepatocytes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Using a model of prenatal maternal 70% food restriction diet (FR30) in rat, we previously showed that maternal undernutrition predisposes offspring to altered lipid metabolism in adipose tissue, especially under high-fat (HF) diet. Here, using microarray-based expression profiling combined with metabolic, endocrine, biochemical, histological and lipidomic approaches, we assessed whether FR30 procedure sensitizes adult male offspring to impaired lipid metabolism in the . No obvious differences were noted in the concentrations of triglycerides, cholesterol and bile acids in the  of 4-month-old FR30 rats whatever the post-weaning diet used. However, several clues suggest that offspring's lipid metabolism and steatosis are modified by maternal undernutrition. First, lipid composition was changed (i.e., higher total saturated  acids and lower elaidic acid) in the  whereas larger triglyceride droplets were observed in hepatocytes of undernourished rats. Second, FR30 offspring exhibited - impact on hepatic gene expression and lipid metabolism pathways under chow diet. Although the transcriptome profile was globally modified by maternal undernutrition, cholesterol and bile acids biosynthesis pathways appear as key targets indicating that FR30 animals were predisposed to impaired hepatic cholesterol metabolism. Third, FR30 procedure markedly modifies hepatic gene transcription profiles in undernourished offspring in response to post-weaning HF.

We built a Markov model with 1-year cycles and 20-year horizon to estimate the economic burden of NASH with T2DM in the U.S.Cohort size was determined by population size, prevalence of T2DM, and prevalence and incidence of NASH in 2017. The model includes 10 health states: NAFL, NASH-fibrosis stages 0-3, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, 1 year post- transplant, post- transplant, and -related, cardiovascular, and background mortality. Transition probabilities were calculated from meta-analyses and literature. Annual costs for NASH and T2DM were taken from literature and billing codes.We estimated that there were 18.2 million people in the U.S. living with T2DM and NAFLD, of which 6.4 million had NASH. Twenty-year costs for NAFLD in these patients were $55.8 billion. Over the next 20 years, NASH with T2DM will account for 65,000 transplants, 1.37 million cardiovascular-related deaths, and 812,000 -related deaths.This model predicts significant clinical and economic burden due to NASH with T2DM over the next 20 years. In fact, this burden may be greater since we assumed conservative inputs for our model and did not increase costs or the incidence of T2DM over time. It is highly likely that interventions reducing morbidity and mortality in NASH patients with T2DM could potentially reduce this projected clinical and economic burden.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673703>Glucagon-Receptor Signaling Reverses Hepatic Steatosis Independent of Leptin Receptor Expression.</a></h2><p>Glucagon (GCG) is an essential regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism that also promotes weight loss. We have shown that glucagon-receptor (GCGR) signaling increases  acid oxidation (FAOx) in primary hepatocytes and reduces  triglycerides in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice; however, the mechanisms underlying this aspect of GCG biology remains unclear. Investigation of hepatic GCGR targets elucidated a potent and previously unknown induction of leptin receptor (Lepr) expression.  leptin signaling is known to increase FAOx and decrease  triglycerides, similar to glucagon action. Therefore, we hypothesized that glucagon increases hepatic LEPR, which is necessary for glucagon-mediated reversal of hepatic steatosis. Eight week-old control and -specific, LEPR-deficient mice (LeprΔ) were placed on a high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks and then treated with a selective GCGR agonist (IUB288) for 14 days.  triglycerides and gene expression were assessed in  tissue homogenates. Administration of IUB288 in both lean and DIO mice increased hepatic Lepr isoforms a-e in acute (4h) and chronic (72h,16d) (p<0.05) settings. LeprΔ mice displayed increased hepatic triglycerides on a chow diet alone (p<0.05), which persisted in a DIO state (p<0.001), with no differences in body weight or composition. Surprisingly, chronic administration of IUB288 in DIO control and LeprΔ mice reduced  triglycerides regardless of genotype (p<0.05). Together these data suggest that GCGR activation induces hepatic Lepr expression and although hepatic glucagon and leptin signaling have similar  lipid targets, these appear to be two distinct pathways.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Vitamin E is recommended for treatment of NASH in the general population. However, its safety and efficacy among HIV-infected patients remain unknown.Single centre, phase IV, open-label, single arm clinical trial.HIV mono-infected patients without significant alcohol intake or viral hepatitis coinfection were included. The diagnosis of NASH was based on the co-existence of , diagnosed by controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) ≥ 248 dB/m, and significant hepatocyte apoptosis, defined by the serum biomarker cytokeratin 18 (CK-18) >130.5 U/L. Participants were treated with 800 IU daily of oral vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) for 24 weeks, and followed for an additional 24 weeks post-discontinuation. Generalized linear mixed effects models were used to evaluate changes in ALT, CAP and CK-18 at the completion of treatment and end of follow-up, controlling for pre-treatment trends.A total of 27 patients were included. Four (15%) had a pretreatment  biopsy, which confirmed the diagnosis of NASH in all cases. Compared to baseline, 24 weeks of vitamin E treatment improved ALT (-27 units/L; 95% confidence interval [CI] -37, --17), CAP scores (-22 dB/m; 95% CI -42, -1) and CK-18 (-123 units/L; 95% CI -201, -46). Conversely, there was no change in BMI. No serious adverse event was reported and no patient was lost to follow-up.In this first clinical trial, we showed that vitamin E is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for NASH in HIV-infected patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639597>A sensitive and efficient method for simultaneous profiling of bile acids and  acids by UPLC-MS/MS.</a></h2><p>The carboxyl group is the functional group in both bile acids (BAs) and  acids (FAs) (BAFAs). Considering the functional correlation and the structural similarity of these compounds, a sensitive and efficient method was developed here for the first time to simultaneously profile BAFAs based on ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Through optimization of the chromatographic conditions, all BAFAs can be efficiently separated and quantified in 19 min with excellent peak shape. For comprehensive profiling of endogenous FAs without standards, a strategy was established to predict the retention times (RTs) of all theoretically possible FAs on the basis of the good multiple linear regression relationship between RT and FA carbon chain length and double bond number. High-resolution mass spectrometry was employed for the final confirmation of these predicted FAs. Twenty-eight FAs in rat serum were newly identified using this strategy. Though the regulation of collision energies (CEs) for highly abundant compounds, the problems of their poor quantification linearity and accuracy caused by MS signal saturation were solved, facilitating the simultaneous quantification of both high- and low-abundance BAFAs with good linearity and accuracy. The established UPLC-MS/MS method was further used to quantify BAFAs in rat serum and to explore the disturbance of BAFA metabolism in the Tripterygium glycoside-induced  injury rat model. A total of 25 BAs and 55 FAs in rat serum were identified and quantified. Several BAFAs, including nordeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid and some unsaturated FAs, were found to differ significantly in the control and model groups. These BAFAs are very promising biomarkers for the evaluation of Tripterygium glycoside-induced  injury.Copyright © 2019.

We examined the effects of acute or chronic intraperitoneal treatment with PEA (20 μg·g body weight) on parameters related to food intake and its regulatory mechanisms, locomotor activity, glucose and lipid metabolism, and the possible involvement of transcription factors and clock genes on metabolic changes in the . Acute PEA treatment induced a decrease in food intake at 6 and 8 h post-injection, comparable to that observed in mammals. This PEA anorectic effect in goldfish could be mediated through interactions with leptin and NPY, as PEA increased hepatic expression of leptin aI and reduced hypothalamic expression of npy. The PEA chronic treatment reduced weight gain, growth rate, and locomotor activity. The rise in glycolytic potential together with the increased potential of glucose to be transported into  suggests an enhanced use of glucose in the  after PEA treatment. In addition, part of glucose may be exported to be used in other tissues. The activity of  acid synthase (FAS) increased after chronic PEA treatment, suggesting an increase in the hepatic lipogenic capacity, in contrast with the mammalian model. Such lipogenic increment could be linked with the PEA-induction of REV-ERBα and BMAL1 found after the chronic treatment. As a whole, the present study shows the actions of PEA in several compartments related to energy homeostasis and feeding behavior, supporting a regulatory role for this N-acylethanolamine in fish.Copyright © 2019.

Therefore, Elovl4 may be particularly important in Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABT; Thunnus thynnus) characterised by having high DHA to EPA ratios. The present study cloned and characterised both the function and expression of an elovl4 cDNA from ABT. The Elovl4 had an open reading frame of 915 base pairs encoding a putative protein of 304 amino acids. Alignment and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the Elovl4 isoform identified in the present study was an Elovl4b. Functional characterisation demonstrated that the Elovl4b enzyme had elongase activity towards all the polyunsaturated  acid (PUFA) substrates assayed. The ABT Elovl4b contributed to DHA biosynthesis by elongation of EPA and DPA to 24:5n-3, the latter being desaturated to 24:6n-3 by the action of fads2 (Δ6 desaturase). Additionally, the ABT Elovl4b has a role in the biosynthesis of very long-chain PUFA up to C, compounds of key structural roles in neural tissues such as eye and brain, which had high levels of elovl4b transcripts. Surprisingly, while the relative expression of fads2, required for the production of DHA from EPA, was increased in  of ABT fed a diet with reduced levels of EPA and DHA, expression of elovl4b was reduced. Results indicated that ABT has enzymes necessary for endogenous production of DHA from EPA and demonstrate that Elovl4b can effectively compensate for absence of Elovl2.Copyright © 2019.

It is characterized by accumulation of fat in the hepatocytes associated with lobular inflammation and balonization, which can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. Thus, a characterization and follow-up of a progression of the fibrosis level of these patients becomes important, being that the transient hepatic elastography is a reliable method for this evaluation with a measure of the kapa index.To evaluate the progression of hepatic fibrosis through elastography in patients with non-alcoholic  disease.Patients who had previously performed hepatic biopsy and noninvasive scores for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis were included in the study. These same subjects were then submitted to current clinical evaluation, laboratory and  elastography tests, defining the level of  fibrosis, about 10 years after the first evaluation.Data were analyzed for 66 patients previously submitted to  biopsy. Of these, 16 were not found, four could not participate because they were debilitated due to hepatic cirrhosis, two had died from an automobile accident and five from complications of cirrhosis of the . Therefore, of the 50 patients with a known history, 9 (18%) had died of cirrhosis or were unable to attend the examination because of their  disease. The remaining population was predominantly female (61.5%), mean age of 63 years, being overweight, dyslipidemia (76.9%), disorders of the glycemic profile (76.9%), and metabolic syndrome (82.1%). Of the 39 cases evaluated, 35% had the same degree of fibrosis at the initial evaluation (biopsy) and at the current evaluation (elastography), 33% had an increase in the degree of fibrosis and another 30% had a decrease in the degree of fibrosis. Twenty-eight patients had NASH at baseline. Regarding these patients, it was observed in the current evaluation, that 25% remained stable in the degree of fibrosis, 39% progressed, and 35% regressed.Despite some limitations of our study, such as the small number of patients, and the use of two different methods of evaluation (biopsy and elastography), the data obtained allow us to conclude that of the 39 evaluated cases, 33% (13) presented progression of fibrosis and the total group of 50 patients, 42% had cirrhosis or died due to  disease.

However, several studies have described populations susceptible to APAP-induced  damage, mainly in livers with steatosis. Thus, clinicians should consider the presence of obesity and other chronic  diseases like nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) when indicating treatment with APAP.  damage from this drug is generated through its metabolite N-acetyl-benzoquinone (NAPQI), which is detoxified with glutathione (GSH).

They are widely used in medical practice, but currently have restricted usefulness. Tetracyclines act by binding to bacterial ribosomes inhibiting protein synthesis. Bacterial resistance is common and is usually caused by plasmids that decrease the bacterial cell wall permeability. At least eight different tetracyclines are currently available in the United States: tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, tigecycline, sarecycline, omadacycline, eravacycline and demeclocycline. Several others tetracyclines have been used in the past in the United States or Europe, but have been withdrawn (chlortetracycline, aureomycin, triacetyloleandomycin, rolitetracycline, oxytetracycline). While all tetracyclines are capable of causing a distinctive form of acute  disease when given intravenously in high doses,  injury from oral forms tetracyclines vary greatly in frequency and clinical features. Minocycline is the most commonly implicated tetracycline in causing  injury and generally ranks within the 10 most common causes of drug induced  injury in developed nations. Minocycline hepatotoxicity generally presents with a long latency, hepatocellular enzyme elevations, prominent autoimmune features, apparent response to corticosteroid therapy and relatively bengn course. Doxycycline, in contrast, usually presents with a short latency (within 60 days), a cholestatic course, mild immunoallergic or autoimmune features and sometimes prolonged, but ultimately benign course. The other tetracyclines have had limited clinical use and are generally suspected but unproven potential causes of  injury.References updated: 10 April 2019</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633654>Evaluation of Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers for Early Phase Clinical Trials of Steatohepatitis in Adolescents.</a></h2><p>Early-phase pediatric nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) clinical trials are designed with non-invasive parameters to assess potential efficacy. Increasingly, these parameters include MRI-derived proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and MR elastography (MRE)-derived shear stiffness as biomarkers of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, respectively. Understanding fluctuations in these measures is essential for calculating trial sample sizes, interpreting results, and planning clinical drug trials in children with NAFLD. Lack of such data in children comprises a critical knowledge gap. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to assess whole- MRI-PDFF change in adolescents with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) over 12 weeks.Adolescents 12-19 years with biopsy-proven NASH undergoing standard-of-care treatment were enrolled. Baseline and week-12 assessments of anthropometrics, transaminases, MRI-PDFF, and MRE-stiffness were obtained.Fifteen adolescents were included (mean age 15.7 [SD 2.9] years). Hepatic MRI-PDFF was stable over 12 weeks (mean absolute change -0.8%, p = 0.24). Correlation between baseline and week-12 values of MRI-PDFF was high (ICC = 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 - 0.99). MRE-stiffness was stable (mean percentage change 2.7%, p = 0.44); correlation between baseline and week-12 values was moderate (ICC = 0.47; 95% CI: 0, 0.79). Changes in weight, BMI, and aminotransferases were not statistically significant.In adolescents with NASH, fluctuations in hepatic MRI-PDFF and MRE-stiffness over 12 weeks of standard-of-care were small. These data on the natural fluctuations in quantitative imaging biomarkers can serve as a reference for interventional trials in pediatric NASH and inform the interpretation and planning of clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637181>Effect of Weight Reduction on Histological Activity and Fibrosis of Lean Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Patient.</a></h2><p>Weight reduction has evidenced benefit on attenuation of histological activity and fibrosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but there is scarcity of data for lean NASH subgroup. We have designed this study to compare the effects of weight reduction on histological activity and fibrosis of lean and non-lean NASH.We have included 20 lean and 20 non-lean histologically proven NASH patients. BMI < 25 kg/m2 was defined as non-lean. Informed consent was taken from each subject. All methods were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Moderate exercise along with dietary restriction was advised for both groups for weight reduction. After 1 year, 16 non-lean and 15 lean had completed second  biopsy.Age, sex, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltrasferase (GGT), Homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL) was similar in both groups. Steatosis, ballooning, lobular inflammation, nonalcoholic  disease activity score (NAS) and fibrosis was similar in the two groups. In lean/non-lean group, any amount of weight reduction, ≥ 5% weight reduction and ≥ 7% weight reduction was found in respectively 8/11, 5/6 and 2/6 patients. In both lean and non-lean groups, weight reduction of any amount was associated with significant reduction of steatosis, ballooning and NAS, except lobular inflammation and fibrosis. In both groups, weight reduction of ≥ 5% was associated with significant reduction in NAS only. However, significant improvement in NAS was noted with ≥ 7% weight reduction in non-lean group only.Smaller amount of weight reduction had the good benefit of improvement in all the segments of histological activity in both lean and non-lean NASH.© 2019 Shahinul Alam, Mohammad Jahid Hasan, Md.

All patients underwent sonographic examination with adiposity measurements and the  biopsy.  fibrosis was evaluated semi-quantitatively according to the METAVIR scoring system and using non-invasive markers of hepatic fibrosis.  Waist circumference (WC) was predictive for increased risk of FP in NAFLD patients. Elevated fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, serum amylase and lipase levels were associated with presence of severe FP ( value = 0.052,  value = 0.007,  value = 0.014;  value = 0.024, respectively). Presence of increased amounts of mesenteric fat was associated with severe FP ( value = 0.013). The results of this study demonstrated highly significant association between NAFLD and presence of FP. The model for predicting the presence of FP was designed with probability value above 6.5.

We evaluated whether fermented black radish ( L. var. ; FBR) ameliorates lipid accumulation, inflammation, and hepatic fibrosis, which are characteristics of the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Fermented black radish treatment reduced lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which appeared to be associated with the downregulation of adipogenic transcription factors, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, and lipid accumulation-related genes including adipocyte protein-2 and  acid synthase. Administration of FBR to C57BL/6J mice challenged with methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet significantly attenuated the increased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and triglyceride. In addition, treatment with FBR interestingly repressed the hepatic inflammation induced with MCD diet, by lowering the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and suppressing the inactivation of macrophages and Kupffer cells in the . Fermented black radish was also shown to mitigate  fibrosis through the inhibition of alpha-smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor beta-1, and collagen type I alpha 1 chain. Our results indicate that FBR ameliorates NAFLD and its related metabolic disease by regulating multiple pathways, suggesting that FBR may be an effective dietary supplement for ameliorating NAFLD.© 2019 The Authors.
