<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30510703>Enzymatic catalysis for sustainable production of high omega-3 triglyceride oil using imidazolium-based ionic liquids.</a></h2><p>Two different fish oil preparations, namely triglycerides and  esters containing, respectively, 30.02% and 74.38% of omega-3 fatty acids, were employed as the substrates for transesterification. Catalyzed by immobilized lipase using imidazolium-based ionic liquid systems, the total content of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and   (DHA) in the resulting triglyceride reached 63.60% when 4% hydrophobic ionic liquid was used, which was 11.74% higher than that of the triglyceride produced in a solvent-free reaction system. The activation  of the product (triglyceride-type fish oil) was 173.64 KJ mol, which was not significantly different from that of the commercial  -type fish oil, so were the other thermal oxidative kinetic parameters. The kinetic parameters depicting the thermal and oxidative stability of the fish oil product provide the basis for industrial processing, storage, and applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30326602>Efficient Extraction of a   (DHA)-Rich Lipid Fraction from  sp. Using Ionic Liquids.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play a significant role in the modulation and prevention of various diseases, and hence are attracting increasing attention from the biotech industry. Thraustochytrids are marine heterokonts that exhibit robust growth rates, high PUFA content, and more specifically, a large percentage of omega-3 fatty acids like   (DHA). Recently, ionic liquids (ILs) have been shown to improve the efficiency of organic solvent extraction of oils from wet oleaginous yeast and microalgae under mild conditions. Two ILs, the imidazolium 1--3-methylimidazolium ethylsulfate [C₂mim][EtSO₄] IL and the phosphonium (tetrabutylphosphonium propanoate [P][Prop]) IL were assessed for their ability to facilitate extraction of PUFA-containing lipids from a  sp. (T18) through efficient cell wall disruption. The oil extracted after IL pretreatment was further characterized with respect to fatty  methyl  (FAME) composition, while the effects of process parameters, such as the ratio of ionic liquid to co-solvent, the mass ratio of microalgae to the mixture of ionic liquid, and type of co-solvent were also investigated for both ILs. The results indicate that these ILs can disrupt the cells of  sp. when mixed with a co-solvent (methanol), and facilitated the recovery of oils over a large degree of dewatered  biomass (0⁻77.2 wt% water) in a short period of time (60 min) at ambient temperature, hence demonstrating a water compatible, low-, lipid recovery method. The lipid recovery was not affected by repeated usage of recycled ILs (tested up to five times).</p></html>
