Epithelial and lamina propria mononuclear cells were isolated from surgical specimens from control, Crohn's , and ulcerative colitis patients. Platelet activating factor was extracted from highly purified cell preparations with 80% ethanol after stimulation with and without 0.2 uM calcium ionophore A23187 and was measured by platelet aggregation assay. Both cell types generated platelet activating factor activity and this was generally comparable for epithelial and lamina propria cells. Basal and stimulated platelet activating factor activity of epithelial and lamina propria cells from ulcerative colitis but not Crohn's  patients was appreciably higher than that of control. Stimulation with calcium ionophore increased appreciably platelet activating factor activity in lamina propria cells from all groups. In contrast, only epithelial cells from ulcerative colitis showed an appreciable increase after calcium ionophore induction. These results suggest that epithelial cells are important contributors to intestinal platelet activating factor generation under normal and  conditions and that epithelial cells actively play a part in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7657099>Experimental colitis alters myenteric nerve function at inflamed and noninflamed sites in the rat.</a></h2><p>Studies in  have shown extensive structural abnormalities in the enteric nervous system of inflamed and noninflamed gut; however, functional correlates are lacking. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of colitis on myenteric nerve function at inflamed and noninflamed sites in rat intestine.Tritiated noradrenaline release was measured from longitudinal muscle myenteric plexus preparations from the distal and transverse colon and terminal ileum of rats with colitis induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid or Trichinella spiralis larvae.As characterized by myeloperoxidase activity and histology, both models induced inflammation restricted to the distal colon. In distal colon in trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid colitis, KCl- or electrical field stimulation-evoked 3H release was suppressed by 56% and 60%, respectively; in T. spiralis-infected rats, the KCl-evoked release was suppressed by 58%. 3H release was also suppressed by similar magnitudes in noninflamed transverse colon and terminal ileum of each model.Experimental distal colitis alters myenteric nerve function in inflamed distal colon and noninflamed gut regions. These changes are independent of the manner in which colitis is induced and provide a basis for the extensive disruption of physiological function observed in .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19264956>Inhibition of sympathetic N-type voltage-gated Ca2+ current underlies the reduction in norepinephrine release during colitis.</a></h2><p> (IBD) are associated with altered neuronal regulation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and impairment of norepinephrine release from sympathetic varicosities. The sympathetic innervation of the GI tract modulates motility, blood flow, and secretion, and therefore defective norepinephrine release may contribute to symptom generation in IBD. Accordingly, our aim here was to utilize the mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS; 5% wt/vol) of IBD to determine how norepinephrine release is reduced during GI inflammation. We hypothesized that the inflammation-induced reduction in norepinephrine release was due to inhibition of voltage-gated Ca(2+) current (I(Ca)) in prevertebral sympathetic neurons. We compared [(3)H]norepinephrine release in the colon and jejunum and I(Ca) amplitude in superior mesenteric ganglion (SMG) neurons from control mice and mice with DSS-induced colitis. Changes to voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels were investigated by fura 2-AM Ca(2+) imaging, perforated patch-clamp electrophysiology, and real-time PCR. Depolarization-induced norepinephrine release from the inflamed colon and uninflamed jejunum was significantly impaired in mice treated with DSS, as was depolarization-induced Ca(2+) influx in SMG neurons. Colitis reduced I(Ca) in SMG neurons by inhibiting omega-conotoxin GVIA (300 nM)-sensitive N-type Ca(2+) channels. The omega-conotoxin GVIA-sensitive component of norepinephrine release was significantly smaller in the colon during colitis. The inhibition of I(Ca) was accompanied by a decrease in mRNA encoding the Ca(2+) channel alpha subunit (CaV 2.2) and a rightward shift in the voltage dependence of activation of I(Ca). These findings suggest that DSS-induced colitis attenuates norepinephrine release in the colon and jejunum due to inhibition of N-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels. This may contribute to functional alterations in both inflamed and uninflamed regions of the GI tract during inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1959469>Treatment of severe hemorrhage from a defunctionalized rectum with adrenaline chloride in ulcerative colitis.</a></h2><p>Three patients suffering from ulcerative colitis, who had previously undergone a colectomy and temporary Brooke ileostomy and who were under treatment with methylprednisolone and 5-aminosalicylic acid per the rectum, were readmitted to the hospital, presenting with profuse rectal hemorrhage with six to nine blood losses per day.

The scientific enthusiasm and number of research investigators, publications, and meetings recently devoted to PAF suggest that this mediator will be the subject of continued study in the foreseeable future. The potential for the presence and involvement of PAF in human  is easily concluded from the reports described in this review. Both the need for low concentrations for cellular response and the rapid biological clearance mechanisms have made the proof of the involvement of PAF in human  difficult. The discovery of PAF receptor antagonists and structure-activity relationships of such antagonists (159) will make this determination possible in the near future. The current PAF antagonists may be considered as first generation agents, since the most potent antagonist is still less than 1/100th as potent as PAF is as an agonist. The wide diversity of clinical applications from asthma to septic shock may also require antagonists with selective attributes such as delivery route (oral vs intravenous vs topical) or biological half-life (prolonged vs short). PAF may prove to be the key mediator of several poorly understood  syndromes such as hyperacute organ transplant rejection, ischemic  necrosis (160), and adult respiratory distress syndrome. We must wait for clinical results to draw further conclusions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819742>Evidence against a systemic arterial defect in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Despite increasing interest in local microvascular alterations associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the potential contribution of a primary systemic vascular defect in the etiology of IBD is unknown. We compared reactivity of large diameter mesenteric arteries from segments affected by Crohn disease (CD) or ulcerative  (UC) to an uninvolved vascular bed in both IBD and control patients.Mesenteric and omental arteries were obtained from UC, CD, and non-IBD patients. Isometric arterial contractions were recorded in response to extracellular potassium (K(+)) and cumulative additions of norepinephrine (NE). In addition, relaxation in response to pinacidil, an activator of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive K(+) channels was examined.Contraction to K(+) and sensitivity to NE were not significantly different in arteries from CD, UC, and controls. Relaxation to pinacidil was also similar between groups.Potassium-induced contractions and sensitivity to NE and pinacidil were not significantly different in large diameter mesenteric and omental arteries obtained from IBD patients. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the sensitivity to K(+), NE, and pinacidil between mesenteric and omental arteries of CD and UC patients and those from non-IBD patients. Our results suggest an underlying vascular defect systemic to CD or UC patients is unlikely to contribute to the etiology of IBD.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study, accordingly, was to investigate the role of phospholipid metabolism in the intestinal mucosa in  (IBD). Surgically resected specimens from patients with Crohn's  (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and colrectal cancer (non-cancerous tissue; as a control) were submitted to phospholipid analysis and a PLase A2 assay, which measures the degradation of endogenous mucosal phospholipids. A high percentage of plasmenylethanolamine (plas.E) was detected in the glycerophospholipid fraction of CD mucosa. The arachidonic acid content of the phosphatidylethanolamine plus plas.E subfraction was higher in inflamed than in intact mucosa in CD. PLaseA2 activity, resulting in lysophosphatidyl  production, was detected only in inflamed mucosa from CD and UC patients, but not in normal mucosa from controls. PLaseA2 activity was highest in moderately inflamed mucosa adjacent to a severely ulcerated area. The PLaseA2 that reacts with endogenous phosphatidylcholine (PC) to form lysoPC was found irrespective of the presence of inflammation. The PLaseA2 that reacts with -containing phospholipids is more closely related to inflammation than other PLaseA2 isoenzymes in IBD mucosa.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14512286>Platelet-activating factor-induced apoptosis is blocked by Bcl-2 in rat intestinal epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Plateletactivating factor (PAF) is a key mediator in pathogenesis of  (IBDs) but mechanisms of PAF-induced mucosal injury are poorly understood. To determine whether apoptosis and the Bcl-2-family of apoptosis regulatory gene products play a role in PAF-induced mucosal injury, we stably and conditionally overexpressed bcl-2 in rat small intestinal epithelial cells-6 under the control of a lactose-inducible promoter. Western blot analysis and immuno-histochemistry were used to verify inducible Bcl-2 and to analyze Bcl-2 and a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, Bax, subcellular distribution. DNA fragmentation was quantified by ELISA, caspase activity was measured by using fluorogenic peptide substrates, and mitochondrial membrane potential was assayed by 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) and fluorescence digital imaging. Bcl-2 expression was highly inducible by lactose analog isopropyl-beta-(d)-thiogalactoside (IPTG) and was localized predominantly to mitochondria. In the absence of bcl-2 overexpression and after treatment with PAF, Bax translocated to mitochondria, and mitochondrial membrane potential collapsed within 1 h, followed by caspase-3 activation, which peaked at 6 h with an ensuing DNA fragmentation maximizing at 18 h. After IPTG-induction of bcl-2 expression, PAF failed to induce DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation, Bax translocation, or a collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential. These data are the first to show that PAF can activate apoptotic machinery in enterocytes via a mechanism involving Bax translocation and collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and that both of these events are under control by bcl-2 expression levels. A better understanding of the role of PAF and Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulators in epithelial cell death might aid design of better therapeutic or preventive strategies for IBDs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5947176>[Lesions produced in animals with the use of epinephrine and sera from patients with non-specific chronic ulcerative colitis in the active phase].</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8488366>Tumor necrosis factor-alpha potentiates phospholipase A2-stimulated release and metabolism of arachidonic acid in cultured intestinal epithelial cells (INT 407).</a></h2><p>Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a known pro- cytokine, has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of  (IBD) by mediating damage to the intestinal epithelial cells. The present study demonstrates that TNF-alpha potentiates release and metabolism of 14C-labeled arachidonic acid (14C-AA) in cultured intestinal epithelial cells (INT 407). Although TNF-alpha on its own was but a weak stimulator of cellular 14C-AA turnover, it significantly potentiated the release of 14C-AA and 14C-labeled prostaglandin E2(14C-PGE2) after stimulation with three known phospholipase A2 activators: phospholipase. C from Clostridium perfringens, the calcium ionophore A23187, and the phorbol ester 4-beta-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). The phospholipase A2 inhibitor quinacrine significantly reduced both AA and PGE2 release after combined stimulation with phospholipase C and TNF-alpha. In contrast to its effect on the AA turnover, TNF-alpha did not affect the phospholipase C-stimulated production of platelet-activating factor (PAF-acether). Taken together, these findings indicate that a) TNF-alpha potentiates phospholipase A2-stimulated AA release from cultured intestinal epithelial cells; b) TNF-alpha may stimulate phospholipase A2-dependent AA release without affecting the formation of PAF-acether and c) pretreatment with TNF-alpha potentiates the formation of PGE2 after stimulation with phospholipase A2 activators. In summary, the present investigation points to the possibility that TNF-alpha may stimulate intestinal epithelial cells to produce biologically active AA metabolites and that this stimulation may be modulated by components of the intestinal luminal content, like bacterial toxins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8675086>Platelet activating factor: release from colonic mucosa in patients with ulcerative colitis and its effect on colonic secretion.</a></h2><p> mediators have been implicated in the pathophysiology of ulcerative colitis. They may stimulate intestinal secretion and contribute to the production of diarrhoea. Platelet activating factor (PAF) may be responsible for a high proportion of this secretory response. Biopsy specimens from inflamed and quiescent mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis and normal human colonic mucosa were cultured or co-cultured. The release of PAF, prostaglandin E2, and leukotriene D4 into the culture medium was measured and the ability of this culture medium, from inflamed and normal tissues, to influence secretion in rat colonic mucosa was assessed. PAF was liberated by inflamed tissue. Its release from quiescent but not normal tissue was stimulated by medium in which inflamed mucosal biopsy tissues had been cultured and by exogenous bradykinin and 5-hydroxytryptamine, but not by histamine. PAF stimulated eicosanoid production. The rise in short circuit current produced in vitro by inflamed tissue culture medium was inhibited by the PAF receptor antagonist (CV 6209) (46%) (32.4 (2.9) v 17.5 (1.19) muA.cm-2, p < 0.005) and further by combined cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibition (indomethacin plus ICI 207968) (58%) (32.4 (2.9) v 13.6 (1.9) muA.cm-2, p < 0.005). Mepacrine and hydrocortisone attenuated considerably the electrical response evoked by medium from inflamed mucosa to a similar extent (32.4 (2.9) v 6.3 (1.2) v 5.1 (0.9) muA.cm-2, p < 0.001). These data suggest that PAF accounted for 46% of the culture medium secretory effect. Thus, any attempt to block its release in patients with ulcerative colitis may have only a partial effect on their symptoms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4110746>[The P-phenomenon].</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8729129>Quantification of distinct molecular species of platelet activating factor in ulcerative colitis.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to characterize the synthesis and metabolism of platelet activating factor (PAF, 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) by colonic mucosa from patients with ulcerative colitis and healthy individuals. Tissue was obtained by endoscopic biopsy and by scraping the mucosa from surgical resections. Tissue was assayed for the various molecular species of PAF and its biologically inactive metabolite lyso-PAF using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Mucosa from surgical resections for ulcerative colitis contained C16:0 PAF (mean = 156 ng/g of mucosa), but not C18:0 PAF, PAF was not identified in mucosa from normal surgical resections or in endoscopic biopsies from either patients with ulcerative colitis or normal individuals. Both C16:0 lyso-PAF and C18:0 lyso-PAF were found in mucosa from normal and ulcerative colitis surgical resections and in endoscopic biopsies from ulcerative colitis and normal tissue. Levels of lyso-PAF were similar in ulcerative colitis and normal mucosa. Incubation of mucosa from areas of active inflammation in ulcerative colitis with the calcium ionophore A23187 increased the levels of C16:0 PAF by 2-3 fold and also increased the levels of C16:0 lyso-PAF. Addition of 3H-PAF to endoscopic biopsies from either normal individuals or patients with ulcerative colitis resulted in hydrolysis to 3H-lyso-PAF.

The enzyme may protect the intestinal mucosa from inflammation and tumorigenesis. PAF (platelet-activating factor) is a pro- phospholipid involved in pathogenesis of . We examined whether alk-SMase can hydrolyse and inactivate PAF. [3H]Octadecyl-labelled PAF was incubated with purified rat intestinal alk-SMase or recombinant human alk-SMase expressed in COS-7 cells. The hydrolytic products were assayed with TLC and MS. We found that alkSMase cleaved the phosphocholine head group from PAF and generated 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol. Differing from the activity against SM, the activity against PAF was optimal at pH 7.5, inhibited by EDTA and stimulated by 0.1-0.25 mM Zn2+. The activity was abolished by site mutation of the predicted metal-binding sites that are conserved in all NPP members. Similar to the activity against SM, the activity against PAF was dependent on bile salt, particularly taurocholate and taurochenodeoxycholate. The V(max) for PAF hydrolysis was 374 mumol x h(-1) x (mg of protein)(-1). The hydrolysis of PAF and SM could be inhibited by the presence of SM and PAF respectively, the inhibition of PAF hydrolysis by SM being stronger. The PAF-induced MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) activation and IL-8 (interleukin 8) release in HT-29 cells, and chemotaxis in leucocytes were abolished by alk-SMase treatment. In conclusion, alk-SMase hydrolyses and inactivates PAF by a phospholipase C activity. The finding reveals a novel function, by which alk-SMase may counteract the development of intestinal inflammation and colon cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9200313>Mediators of mucosal inflammation: implications for therapy.</a></h2><p>Treatment of  remains a challenge.

Our main objective in this investigation was to study the effect of an acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis on the expression and function of beta(3)-adrenoceptors in the rat colon. Inflammation was induced by administering acetic acid intrarectally into rats. Levels of myeloperoxidase activity and beta(3)-adrenoceptor mRNA were measured in colon samples taken following acetic acid administration. Relaxation responses to beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonists were also studied. Ulcerative colitis was associated with significantly elevated levels of myeloperoxidase activity in the colon segments. Levels of beta(3)-adrenoceptor mRNA as well as the relaxation responses to isoprenaline and BRL 37344 were however not significantly different between inflamed and control tissue. Acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis in rats was not associated with changes in the expression and/or function of beta(3)-adrenoceptors in the rat colon. Therefore, the dysfunctional motility that is characteristic of ulcerative colitis, is not likely to be due to changes in beta(3)-adrenergic mechanisms in this model.Copyright 2002 S.

Biopsies of colonic mucosa from patients with ulcerative colitis liberated more interleukin-1 beta, prostaglandin E2, leukotriene C4 and platelet-activating factor into the medium in which they were cultured than biopsies from patients with irritable  syndrome and histologically normal mucosa. 2. Addition of interleukin-1 stimulated release of greater quantities of all these  mediators, including interleukin-1 itself, from inflamed and normal mucosa. 3. Blockade of cyclo-oxygenase with indomethacin or of lipoxygenase with ICI 207968 or of phospholipase A2 with mepacrine inhibited release of prostaglandin E2 or leukotriene C4 or both of these plus platelet-activating factor, respectively. 4. Interleukin-1 stimulated the short-circuit current across isolated rat colonic mucosa mounted in flux chambers in a dose-dependent manner (Km 2 x 10(-11) mol/l). This stimulation was markedly inhibited by the removal of chloride from the bathing media. 5. Indomethacin or ICI 207968 inhibited the short-circuit current response to interleukin-1 and a combination of these antagonists produced a greater inhibition. Mepacrine caused an even greater inhibition whereas tetrodotoxin plus mepacrine inhibited the current completely. 6. These data indicate that interleukin-1, released in excess from inflamed colonic mucosa, stimulates the release of a range of  mediators as well as of more interleukin-1. It probably acts by stimulating phospholipase A2 in  cells, probably lymphocytes, and can do so in normal and inflamed mucosa. Since, in rat colonic mucosa it stimulated an electrical response in very low concentrations, it is feasible that it is involved in the chloride secretion, and hence the diarrhoea, which may occur in  reactions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30102254>Intestinal P-glycoprotein exports endocannabinoids to prevent inflammation and maintain homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Neutrophil influx into the intestinal lumen is a critical response to infectious agents, but is also associated with severe intestinal damage observed in idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease. The chemoattractant hepoxilin A3, an eicosanoid secreted from intestinal epithelial cells by the apically restricted efflux pump multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2), mediates this neutrophil influx. Information about a possible counterbalance pathway that could signal the lack of or resolution of an apical inflammatory signal, however, has yet to be described. We now report a system with such hallmarks. Specifically, we identify endocannabinoids as the first known endogenous substrates of the apically restricted multidrug resistance transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and reveal a mechanism, which we believe is novel, for endocannabinoid secretion into the intestinal lumen. Knockdown or inhibition of P-gp reduced luminal secretion levels of N-acyl -type endocannabinoids, which correlated with increased neutrophil transmigration in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, loss of CB2, the peripheral cannabinoid receptor, led to increased pathology and neutrophil influx in models of acute intestinal inflammation. These results define a key role for epithelial cells in balancing the constitutive secretion of antiinflammatory lipids with the stimulated secretion of proinflammatory lipids via surface efflux pumps in order to control neutrophil infiltration into the intestinal lumen and maintain homeostasis in the healthy intestine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7708808>Platelet-activating factor mediates trinitrobenzene induced colitis.</a></h2><p>Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is an endogenous phospholipid which may be an important mediator of shock and inflammation. Recent evidence suggests that PAF plays a role in the development of ischemic colitis and . Its effects are mediated by second messengers, including the arachidonic acid metabolites. Using an ex vivo isolated left colon rabbit perfusion model, our aims were to determine whether exogenously administered trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNB), which produces experimental colitis, stimulates both PAF and eicosanoid release in the colon, and if so, whether this effect can be blocked by a PAF antagonist. Colonic inflammation was induced by the intracolonic administration of 0.25 ml of 50% ethanol containing 30 mg of TNB. Tissue and perfusate concentrations of the eicosanoids, [prostaglandin E (PGE2), 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2), leukotriene B4 (LTB4)] and the autocoid PAF were measured by ELISA. During TNB infusion there was a significant increase in tissue levels of PAF compared to control colons. Additional studies performed pretreating the colons with the PAF receptor antagonist WEB-2170 prior to TNB infusion blocked PAF release. TNB stimulated release of luminal eicosanoids except LTB4 and suppressed release of tissue prostanoids. Pretreatment with WEB-2170 prior to TNB inhibited luminal eicosanoids, and inhibited PGE2 and prostacyclin, but not TX tissue suppression. Inhibition of TNB-stimulated PAF release by WEB-2170 suggests that PAF may play a role in TNB-induced colitis and this phenomenon may mediate tissue injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9552223>Mucin secretion in : comparison of a macrophage-derived mucin secretagogue (MMS-68) to conventional secretagogues.</a></h2><p>We have described a novel macrophage-derived mucin secretagogue (MMS-68) that mediates mucin secretion in colon cancer cell lines and explants of normal and  (IBD) mucosa. We compared MMS-68 induced mucin release with other known intestinal mucin secretagogues in normal colon explants and in the HT-29 colon cancer cell line, and to study the effects of MMS-68 on mucin release from inflamed and uninflamed ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's  (CD) mucosa. In normal colonic explants and HT-29 cells, each of the secretagogues including, MMS-68-induced mucin release two- to fivefold more than culture medium alone. In HT-29 cells, MMS-68 plus leukotriene C4 (LTC4) induced a 50% increase in mucin release over either secretagogue alone, and MMS-68 plus platelet-activating factor (PAF) markedly enhanced mucin release by eightfold over either secretagogue. In colonic explants from patients with UC and CD, the mucin release in response to MMS-68 was similar to that of normal colonic explants. Likewise, in isolated epithelial cells from CD and UC (whether involved or uninvolved), MMS-68-induced release was similar to that of epithelial cells isolated from normal colonic mucosa. The number of MMS-68-producing macrophages was lower in uninflamed UC mucosa compared with inflamed UC mucosa and CD mucosa. The mucin secretagogue activity of MMS-68 is comparable to that of other known secretagogues, and PAF can have a synergistic effect on this activity. Whole tissue explants and isolated colonic epithelial cells from patients with IBD respond at least as well as their normal counterparts to MMS-68. MMS-68 may play a role in mucin secretion in normal and inflamed colonic tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24818658>Palmitoylethanolamide normalizes intestinal motility in a model of post-inflammatory accelerated transit: involvement of CB₁ receptors and TRPV1 channels.</a></h2><p>Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), a naturally occurring acylethanolamide chemically related to the endocannabinoid anandamide, interacts with targets that have been identified in peripheral nerves controlling gastrointestinal motility, such as cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors, TRPV1 channels and PPARα. Here, we investigated the effect of PEA in a mouse model of functional accelerated transit which persists after the resolution of colonic inflammation (post-inflammatory irritable bowel syndrome).Intestinal inflammation was induced by intracolonic administration of oil of mustard (OM). Mice were tested for motility and biochemical and molecular biology changes 4 weeks later. PEA, oleoylethanolamide and endocannabinoid levels were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and receptor and enzyme mRNA expression by qRT-PCR.OM induced transient  and a functional post-inflammatory increase in upper gastrointestinal transit, associated with increased intestinal anandamide (but not 2-arachidonoylglycerol, PEA or oleoylethanolamide) levels and down-regulation of mRNA for TRPV1 channels. Exogenous PEA inhibited the OM-induced increase in transit and tended to increase anandamide levels. Palmitic acid had a weaker effect on transit. Inhibition of transit by PEA was blocked by rimonabant (CB1 receptor antagonist), further increased by 5'-iodoresiniferatoxin (TRPV1 antagonist) and not significantly modified by the PPARα antagonist GW6471.Intestinal endocannabinoids and TRPV1 channel were dysregulated in a functional model of accelerated transit exhibiting aspects of post-inflammatory irritable bowel syndrome. PEA counteracted the accelerated transit, the effect being mediated by CB1 receptors (possibly via increased anandamide levels) and modulated by TRPV1 channels.© 2014 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28431755>Fever induced by mesalazine.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15419177>The epinephrine test for cortico-adrenal reserve function and the excretions of corticosteroids and 17-ketosteroids in chronic ulcerative colitis.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5007666>Perimuscular excision of the rectum for Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis.

Multifactorial evidence suggests that a defect of innate immune response to microbial agents is involved in IBD. This editorial outlines the immunopathogenesis of IBD and their current and future therapy. We present IBD as a result of dysregulated mucosal response in the intestinal wall facilitated by defects in epithelial barrier function and the mucosal immune system with excessive production of cytokines growth factors, adhesion molecules, and reactive oxygen metabolites, resulting in tissue injury. Established and evolving therapies are discussed in the second part of this editorial and at the end of this section we review new therapies to modulate the immune system in patients with IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10952687>Intestinal anti- activity of UR-12746, a novel 5-ASA conjugate, on acute and chronic experimental colitis in the rat.</a></h2><p>The present study was undertaken to investigate the intestinal anti- effects of UR-12746 on the acute and chronic stages of a trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) experimental model of  (IBD) in the rat. UR-12746 is a novel, locally-acting compound which combines, through an azo bond, 5-aminosalicylic (5-ASA) and UR-12715, a potent platelet activating factor (PAF)-antagonist. UR-12746 oral pretreatment of colitic rats (50 and 100 mg kg(-1)) reduced acute colonic damage when evaluated 2 days after colonic insult. Postreatment for 4 weeks with UR-12746 (50 and 100 mg kg(-1)) resulted in a faster recovery of the damaged colonic mucosa, which was macroscopically significant from the third week. The intestinal anti- effect of UR-12746 was associated with a decrease in leukocyte infiltration in the colonic mucosa, which was evidenced both biochemically, by a reduction in myeloperoxidase activity, and histologically, by a lower leukocyte count after morphometric analysis. This effect was higher than that seen with sulphasalazine, when assayed at the same doses and in the same experimental conditions. Several mechanisms can be involved in the beneficial effects showed by UR-12746: inhibition of leukotriene B(4) synthesis in the inflamed colon, improvement of the altered colonic oxidative status, and reduction of colonic interleukin-1beta production. The results suggest that the intestinal anti- activity of UR-12746 can be attributed to the additive effects exerted by 5-ASA and UR-12715, the PAF antagonist compound, that are released in the colonic lumen after reduction of the azo bond by the intestinal bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21296867>Maternal methyl-donor supplementation induces prolonged murine offspring colitis susceptibility in association with mucosal epigenetic and microbiomic changes.</a></h2><p>Developmental epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, have been recognized as potential pathogenic factors in , the hallmark of which is an exaggerated immune response against luminal microbes. A methyl-donor (MD) diet can modify DNA methylation at select murine genomic loci during early development. The components of the MDs are routinely incorporated into prenatal human supplements. Therefore, we studied the effects of maternal MD supplementation on offspring colitis susceptibility and colonic mucosal DNA methylation and gene expression changes in mice as a model. Additionally, we investigated the offspring mucosal microbiomic response to the maternal dietary supplementation. Colitis was induced by dextran sulfate sodium. Colonic mucosa from offspring of MD-supplemented mothers following reversal to control diet at weaning was interrogated by methylation-specific microarrays and pyrosequencing at postnatal days 30 (P30) and P90. Transcriptomic changes were analyzed by microarray profiling and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The mucosal microbiome was studied by high throughput pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA. Maternal MD supplementation induced a striking susceptibility to colitis in offspring. This phenotype was associated with colonic mucosal DNA methylation and expression changes. Metagenomic analyses did not reveal consistent bacteriomic differences between P30 and P90, but showed a prolonged effect of the diet on the offspring mucosal microbiome. In conclusion, maternal MD supplementation increases offspring colitis susceptibility that associates with persistent epigenetic and prolonged microbiomic changes. These findings underscore that epigenomic reprogramming relevant to mammalian colitis can occur during early development in response to maternal dietary modifications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8781921>Concentrations of platelet activating factor in rectal mucosa in patients with ulcerative colitis.</a></h2><p>To find out if concentrations of platelet activating factor (PAF), which has been proposed as a mediator in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's , are increased in the rectal mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis.Open study.University hospital, Sweden.45 Patients with ulcerative colitis (19 with active  and 26 in remission), and 6 control patients and 11 healthy volunteers who acted as controls.Rectal biopsy.PAF content of rectal biopsy specimens.There were no differences between the PAF content of rectal mucosa in patients with active  (median 47 pmol/g wet weight), patients in remission (47 pmol/g), and controls (51 pmol/g). There was no correlation between PAF content and inflammation seen endoscopically or histologically. 13 Patients who had active  were investigated on a second occasion 9 weeks later (range 7-17), when in remission having received steroids but steroid-free at that time. There was a slight but not significant trend towards lower concentrations of PAF (median 33 pmol/g) compared with their previous results, possibly as a result of treatment. PAF concentrations were significantly lower than those of a group of patients in clinically stable remission of longer duration (p < 0.05).We did not find high concentrations of PAF in the rectal mucosa of patients with active ulcerative colitis compared with patients in remission or controls.

In CD, but not in UC, NE tissue levels in both the noninflamed and inflamed colonic mucosa were markedly lower than in control subjects (N = 16). In the inflamed mucosa of CD and in UC patients levels of L-DOPA were twice those in controls. DA levels in the inflamed mucosa of CD and UC patients were markedly lower than in controls. This resulted in significant reductions in DA/L-DOPA tissue ratios, a rough measure of L-amino acid decarboxylase activity. 5-HT levels in the inflamed mucosa of CD and UC patients were markedly lower than in controls.

PAF is known to activate NF-κB, however, the mechanisms of PAF-induced inflammation are not fully defined. We have recently described a novel PAF-triggered pathway of NF-κB activation and IL-8 production in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), requiring the pivotal role of the adaptor protein Bcl10 and its interactions with CARMA3 and MALT1. The current studies examined the potential role of the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus in reversing the PAF-induced, Bcl10-dependent NF-κB activation and IL-8 production in IECs. PAF treatment (5 µM×24 h) of NCM460 and Caco-2 cells significantly increased nuclear p65 NF-κB levels and IL-8 secretion (2-3-fold, P<0.05), compared to control, which were blocked by pretreatment of the cells for 6 h with L. acidophilus (LA) or its culture supernatant (CS), followed by continued treatments with PAF for 24 h. LA-CS also attenuated PAF-induced increase in Bcl10 mRNA and protein levels and Bcl10 promoter activity. LA-CS did not alter PAF-induced interaction of Bcl10 with CARMA3, but attenuated Bcl10 interaction with MALT1 and also PAF-induced ubiquitination of IKKγ. Efficacy of bacteria-free CS of LA in counteracting PAF-induced  cascade suggests that soluble factor(s) in the CS of LA mediate these effects.

In vitro studies indicate that it is also implicated in immune responses. Hyperleptinaemia has been reported in acute inflammation, especially during the early stages of intestinal inflammation in rats. The present study investigated the possible role of leptin in the pathogenesis of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in rats. Since no specific antagonist of leptin is available, a CCK-B antagonist (YM022) and a beta3 agonist (BRL37344) were used in this study to inhibit leptin secretion. Colitis was induced by intracolonic instillation of TNBS in rats. Five TNBS-groups were subcutaneously implanted with micropumps containing: placebo, YM022, BRL37344, BRL37344 and exogenous leptin simultaneously, or leptin alone. At sacrifices, colitis severity was assessed by macroscopic and histological scoring systems and by determination of tissue myeloperoxidase activity. The TNBS-induced hyperleptinaemia was significantly reduced by YM022 and BRL37344 (p<0.05). Inhibition of leptin secretion markedly reduced colonic inflammation, whatever the criteria considered (i.e. macroscopic, histological or biochemical). In contrast, administration of exogenous leptin completely abolished the beneficial effect of leptin-lowering drugs on colitis severity. These results provide the first direct evidence for an important deleterious role of leptin in the pathogenesis of experimental intestinal inflammation and suggest that a pro- activity is attributable to leptin in vivo. Further studies are required to determine if these results have clinical significance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8278326>[Fecal platelet-activating factor (PAF).

However, the presence and function of NAE-PPARα signaling system in the ulcerative colitis (UC) of humans remain unknown as well as its response to active anti- therapies such as 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and glucocorticoids. Expression of PPARα receptor and PPARα ligands-biosynthetic (NAPE-PLD) and -degrading (FAAH and NAAA) enzymes were analyzed in untreated active and 5-ASA/glucocorticoids/immunomodulators-treated quiescent UC patients compared to healthy human colonic tissue by RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses. PPARα, NAAA, NAPE-PLD and FAAH showed differential distributions in the colonic epithelium, lamina propria, smooth muscle and enteric plexus. Gene expression analysis indicated a decrease of PPARα, PPARγ and NAAA, and an increase of FAAH and iNOS in the active colitis mucosa. Immunohistochemical expression in active colitis epithelium confirmed a PPARα decrease, but showed a sharp NAAA increase and a NAPE-PLD decrease, which were partially restored to control levels after treatment. We also characterized the immune cells of the UC mucosa infiltrate. We detected a decreased number of NAAA-positive and an increased number of FAAH-positive immune cells in active UC, which were partially restored to control levels after treatment. NAE-PPARα signaling system is impaired during active UC and 5-ASA/glucocorticoids treatment restored its normal expression. Since 5-ASA actions may work through PPARα and glucocorticoids through NAE-producing/degrading enzymes, the use of PPARα agonists or FAAH/NAAA blockers that increases endogenous PPARα ligands may yield similar therapeutics advantages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19800336>Adrenergic stimulation mediates visceral hypersensitivity to colorectal distension following heterotypic chronic stress.</a></h2><p>Chronic stress exacerbates or causes relapse of symptoms such as abdominal pain and cramping in patients with irritable  syndrome. We investigated whether chronic stress increases plasma norepinephrine and sensitizes colon-specific dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons by increasing expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the colon wall.Heterotypic chronic stress (HeCS) was applied to male Wistar rats and neurologic and molecular responses were analyzed. Tissues were analyzed for NGF expression.HeCS significantly increased visceromoter response to colorectal distension; expression of NGF increased in colonic muscularis externa and mucosa/submucosa. Rheobase decreased, resting membrane potential was depolarized, and electrogenesis of action potentials increased in colon-specific thoracolumbar DRG neurons. Luminal administration of resiniferatoxin in distal colon, systemic administration of anti-NGF antibody, or inhibition of the NGF receptor trkA by k252a or antisense oligonucleotides in thoracolumbar DRG blocked the chronic stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity to colorectal distension. Blockade of alpha1/alpha2- and beta1/beta2-adrenergic receptors prevented the stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity and increased expression of NGF in the colon wall. HeCS did not induce any  response in the colon wall.The peripheral stress mediator norepinephrine induces visceral hypersensitivity to colorectal distension in response to HeCS by increasing the expression of NGF in the colon wall, which sensitizes primary afferents in the absence of an  response.Copyright 2010 AGA Institute.

This neurotrophin promotes macrophage recruitment in the mucosa, amplify colonic inflammation and interacts with toll-like receptors (TLR). Molecules inhibiting S100B-driven enteric activation might mitigate the course of ulcerative colitis (UC). This study aims to investigate the effects of palmitoylethanolammide (PEA), a drug able to counteract astroglial activation in the central nervous system, on intestinal inflammation, in humans and mice.Mouse models of dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced colitis, colonic biopsies deriving from UC patients and primary cultures of mouse and human enteric glial cells (EGC), have been used to assess the effects of PEA, alone or in the presence of specific PPARα or PPARγ antagonists, on: macroscopic signs of UC (DAI score, colon length, spleen weight, macrophages/neutrophils infiltration); the expression and release of proinflammatory markers typical of UC; TLR pathway in EGCs.PEA treatment improves all macroscopic signs of UC and decreases the expression and release of all the proinflammatory markers tested. PEA anti- effects are mediated by the selective targeting of the S100B/TLR4 axis on ECG, causing a downstream inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB)-dependent inflammation. Antagonists at PPARα, but not PPARγ, abolished PEA effects, in mice and in humans.Because of its lack of toxicity, its ability in reducing inflammation and its selective PPARα action, PEA might be an innovative molecule to broaden pharmacological strategies against UC.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

There was a significant rise in the noradrenaline (NA) content compared with the seven control patients (p smaller than 0.01). This may be a compensatory phenomenon to inhibit increased intestinal motility. The increased NA level may be due to the intense perivascular adrenergic plexus typical for ulcerative colitis.

RNA sequencing analysis of  isolated from monoassociated wild type and IL-10 mice identified 408 genes including 14 genes of the  utilization () locus that were significantly up-regulated in response to inflammation. Despite considerable up-regulation of  genes, deletion of  utilization (Δ) had no impact on  colitogenic activity in monoassociated IL-10 mice.

Transcriptional profiling revealed that the bacterial environment reprograms  gene expression in response to inflammation, with the majority of differentially expressed genes not being shared between monocolonized and SIHUMI conditions. While in  monoassociation a general bacterial stress response could be observed, expression of  genes in SIHUMI-colonized mice was characterized by up-regulation of genes involved in growth and replication. Interestingly, in mice colonized with SIHUMI lacking  enhanced inflammation was observed in comparison to SIHUMI-colonized mice, supporting the hypothesis that   metabolism protects against  in complex consortia.

Nerve stimulation (2-20 Hz) caused frequency-dependent vasoconstrictor responses that were abolished by tetrodotoxin (300 nm) and guanethidine (10 microm). The P2 receptor antagonist suramin (100 microm) or the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (100 nm) reduced the vasoconstriction and the combination of suramin and prazosin completely abolished responses. Nerve-evoked constrictions of submucosal arterioles from mice with TNBS colitis were inhibited by prazosin but not suramin. Superfusion of ATP (10 microm) resulted in large vasoconstrictions in control mice but had no effect in mice with colitis whereas constrictions to phenylephrine (3 microm) were unaffected.

PAF was not detected in normal mucosa, whereas A23187 and antihuman IgE stimulated its activity: mean +/- SE, 43.2 +/- 8.6 and 33.0 +/- 6.1 pg/10 mg wet weight, respectively. In active ulcerative colitis, A23187 and antihuman IgE induced significantly higher stimulation of PAF synthesis compared to their effects on normal mucosa. The enhanced stimulation of PAF induced by A23187 was dose-dependently inhibited by sulphasalazine, 5-aminosalicylic acid and prednisolone, but not by sulfapyridine. Colonic interleukin-1 content and release during 24 h of culture were significantly higher in patients with active ulcerative colitis and Crohn's  compared to normal subjects. Prednisolone significantly and dose-dependently inhibited interleukin-1 release. These results suggest that colonic generation of PAF and interleukin-1 are elevated in patients with  and, thus, may have a role in its pathogenesis.

The type of T cell responses DC induce is dependent on the local immunological environment where antigen has been taken up. In the gut, resident DC are phenotypically and functionally shaped by epithelial and stromal cell derived signals, the cytokine microenvironment, and neuronal products. These factors can control the activation state of DC thereby inducing tolerance for food and commensal organisms or immunity against pathogenic microbes. The enteric nervous system (ENS) is increasingly recognized as an important regulatory factor in intestinal immune cell control. Neurotransmitters and neuropeptides like acetylcholine (ACh), norepinephrine (NE) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) are released by neurons of the ENS and can affect the function of DC and subsequent immune responses. The critical balance between tolerance and protective immunity is disrupted in , which results in an exaggerated immune response against commensal bacteria. In this review we discuss the effects of ACh, VIP, and NE on DC function. DC express various receptors for these neuron derived products and can alter DC co-stimulatory molecule expression, cytokine release and subsequent T cell activation in an anti- fashion. Knowledge about these interactions will help find new drug targets and may facilitate the development of specific therapies for  like  (IBD).Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Ulcerative  (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD) represent paradigmatic examples of intestinal chronic inflammatory conditions in which the process of neovascularization correlates with the severity and progression of the diseases. Molecules able to target the angiogenesis have thus the potential to synergistically affect the disease course. Beyond its anti-inflammatory effect, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is able to reduce angiogenesis in several chronic inflammatory conditions, but no data about its anti-angiogenic activity in  have been produced, yet.The effects of PEA on inflammation-associated angiogenesis in mice with dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced  and in patients with UC were assessed. The release of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), the hemoglobin tissue content, the expression of CD31 and of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian-target-of-rapamycin (mTOR) signaling axis were all evaluated in the presence of different concentrations of PEA and concomitant administration of PPAR-α and -γ antagonists.Our results demonstrated that PEA, in a selective peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-α dependent mechanism, inhibits -associated angiogenesis, decreasing VEGF release and new vessels formation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the mTOR/Akt axis regulates, at least partly, the angiogenic process in IBD and that PEA directly affects this pathway.Our results suggest that PEA may improve inflammation-driven angiogenesis in colonic mucosa, thus reducing the mucosal damage and potentially affecting disease progression and the shift towards the carcinogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17072715>Adrenal incidentaloma: review of 197 patients and report of a drug-related false-positive urinary normetanephrine result.</a></h2><p>To determine the incidence and importance of functioning tumors among incidentally discovered adrenal masses in the era of laparoscopic surgery.We defined adrenal incidentaloma as a tumor detected during abdominal imaging for adrenal-unrelated reasons, and we reviewed 197 consecutive patients with adrenal incidentaloma diagnosed since we started laparoscopic adrenalectomy.Incidentaloma was discovered initially in 91 (46%) patients and pheochromocytoma was detected as an incidentaloma in 21 (39%) of 54 patients.

In this study, we investigate the mechanism of NF-kappaB activation and the role of the NF-kappaB p50 subunit in PAF-induced shock and acute  injury. NF-kappaB p50-deficient mice and wild-type mice were anesthetized and tracheotomized, and their carotid artery was cannulated for blood pressure monitoring, blood sampling, and PAF administration. For determination of  injury, shock, and survival, PAF (2.2 microg/kg, intra-arterially, i.a.) was injected. Two hours later, animals were euthanized, and their small intestines were removed for histological examination. For biochemical studies, PAF (1.5 microg/kg i.a.) was administered and the small intestine removed after 15-60 min. We found that PAF induced an increase in p105 processing within 30 min, but there were no changes in the levels of the NF-kappaB inhibitory proteins IkappaBalpha and beta. NF-kappaB p50-deficient mice were protected against PAF-induced mortality, shock, intestinal hypoperfusion, and injury compared with wild-type animals. We also found that p50-deficient mice had decreased gene expression of CXCL2 and TNF and a decrease in CXCL2 protein production compared with wild-type mice.

In inflammatory bowel disease, sympathetic innervation in intestinal mucosa is reduced. Our aim was to investigate the role of sympathetic innervation to the intestine on regulation of the innate immune responses.In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages, we evaluated the effect of adrenergic receptor activation on cytokine production and metabolic profile. In vivo, the effect of sympathetic denervation on mucosal innate immune responses using 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), or using surgical transection of the superior mesenteric nerve (sympathectomy) was tested in Rag1 mice that lack T- and B-lymphocytes.In murine macrophages, adrenergic β2 receptor activation elicited a dose-dependent reduction of LPS-induced cytokines, reduced LPS-induced glycolysis and increased maximum respiration. Sympathectomy led to a significantly decreased norepinephrine concentration in intestinal tissue. Within 14 days after sympathectomy, mice developed clinical signs of , colon oedema and excess colonic cytokine production. Both 6-OHDA and sympathectomy led to prominent goblet cell depletion and histological damage of colonic mucosa.We conclude that the sympathetic nervous system plays a regulatory role in constraining innate immune cell reactivity towards microbial challenges, likely via the adrenergic β2 receptor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27625036>Adelmidrol, a Palmitoylethanolamide Analogue, as a New Pharmacological Treatment for the Management of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Leukocyte infiltration, improved levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and oxidative stress in the colon are the principal factors in inflammatory bowel disease. The goal of the current study was to explore the effects of adelmidrol, an analog of the anti-inflammatory fatty acid amide signaling molecule palmitoylethanolamide, in mice subjected to experimental . Additionally, to clarify whether the protective action of adelmidrol is dependent on the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), we investigated the effects of a PPARγ antagonist, GW9662, on adelmidrol action. Adelmidrol (10 mg/kg daily, o.s.) was tested in a murine experimental model of  induced by intracolonic administration of dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. Nuclear factor-κB translocation, cyclooxygenase-2, and phosphoextracellular signal-regulated kinase, as well as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, were significantly increased in colon tissues after dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid administration. Immunohistochemical staining for ICAM-1, P-selectin, nitrotyrosine, and poly(ADP)ribose showed a positive staining in the inflamed colon. Treatment with adelmidrol decreased diarrhea, body weight loss, and myeloperoxidase activity. Adelmidrol treatment, moreover, reduced nuclear factor-κB translocation, cyclooxygenase-2, and phosphoextracellular signal-regulated kinase expression; proinflammatory cytokine release; and the incidence of nitrotyrosine and poly(ADP)ribose in the colon. It also decreased the upregulation of ICAM-1 and P-selectin. Adelmidrol treatment produced a reduction of Bax and an intensification of Bcl-2 expression.

The best-studied AEs are the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA), the anti- compound palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), and the potent anorexigenic molecule oleoylethanolamide (OEA). AEs are biosynthesized in the gastrointestinal tract, and their levels may change in response to noxious stimuli, food deprivation or diet-induced obesity. The biological actions of AEs within the gut are not limited to the modulation of food intake and energy balance. For example, AEs exert potential beneficial effects in the regulation of intestinal motility, secretion, inflammation and cellular proliferation. Molecular targets of AEs, which have been identified in the gastrointestinal tract, include cannabinoid CB(1) and CB(2) receptors (activated by AEA), transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1, activated by AEA and OEA), the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha, activated by OEA and, to a less extent, by PEA), and the orphan G-coupled receptors GPR119 (activated by OEA) and GPR55 (activated by PEA and, with lower potency, by AEA and OEA).

Therefore, the effects of in vivo treatment for three days with interleukins 1beta and 6 were investigated on rat isolated mesenteric vascular bed (MVB). 3. A significant concentration-dependent increase in vascular response to noradrenaline (NA) was found, with a significant difference in Emax between control (93.01 +/- 16.78 mmHg) and treated preparations (137.91 +/- 5.20 mmHg). Endothelin-1(ET-1) induced a significantly greater increase of perfusion pressure in treated rats in comparison with control rats at the highest concentration used (0.1 microm). 4. The concentration-dependent decrease of perfusion pressure induced by acetylcholine (ACh) in MVB precontracted with NA was significantly reduced in specimens from treated rats in comparison with control rats, with a significant difference in Emax between control and treated preparations. 5. Perivascular nerve stimulation (PNS) evoked contractions with no difference between treatments. Similarly, no difference in relaxant effect was found after PNS in specimens precontracted with NA, in the presence of guanethidine. 6. These findings indicate that the precocious inflammation acts only at postsynaptic level, facilitating vascular contraction.

The development of a stable and diverse gut microbiota is essential to various host physiologic functions such as immunoregulation, pathogen prevention, energy harvest, and metabolism. At the same time, a dysbiotic gut microbiota associated with disease is altered in structure and function, and often characterized by a decrease in species richness and proliferation of pathogenic bacterial taxa. As a shared substrate between the host and the gut microbiota, diet significantly impacts the health and disease states of the host both directly and through gut microbial metabolite production. This is demonstrated in the examples of short-chain fatty acid and trimethylamine production via bacterial metabolism of dietary complex carbohydrates and choline, respectively. In disorders related to mucosal immune dysregulation such as inflammatory bowel disease, the dysbiotic gut microbiota and diet contribute to its pathogenesis. Reversal of dysbiosis through fecal microbiota transplantation and dietary interventions may thus represent important strategies to modify the gut microbiota and its metabolite production for health maintenance as well as disease prevention and management.© 2017 Nestec Ltd., Vevey/S.

(11)C-choline PET and (18)F-FDG PET were performed within 2 wk of each other on each patient. The patients fasted for at least 5 h before the PET examinations, and PET was performed 5 min ((11)C-choline) and 60 min ((18)F-FDG) after injection of each tracer. PET images were corrected for the transmission data, and the reconstructed images were visually analyzed. Then, the standardized uptake value (SUV) was calculated for quantitative assessment of tumor uptake. PET results were compared with surgical histology or >6 mo of clinical observations.Of 18 untreated patients, (11)C-choline PET correctly detected primary tumors in 16 patients, whereas (18)F-FDG PET detected them in 14 patients. In 1 patient with small uterine cervical cancer and 1 diabetic patient with uterine corpus cancer, only (11)C-choline PET was true-positive. Both tracers were false-negative for atypical hyperplasia of the endometrium in 1 patient and were false-positive for pelvic   in 1 patient. For the diagnosis of recurrent ovarian cancer (n = 3), (11)C-choline PET and (18)F-FDG PET were true-positive in 1 patient, whereas neither tracer could detect cystic recurrent tumor and microscopic peritoneal  in the other 2 patients. In the 15 patients with true-positive results for both tracers, tumor SUVs were significantly higher for (18)F-FDG than for (11)C-choline (9.14 +/- 3.78 vs. 4.61 +/- 1.61, P < 0.0001). In 2 patients with uterine cervical cancer, parailiac lymph node metastases were clearly visible on (18)F-FDG PET but were obscured by physiologic  uptake on (11)C-choline PET.The use of (11)C-choline PET is feasible for imaging of gynecologic tumors.

The aim of this study was to determine whether the gene mutation was associated with the severity of ulcerative colitis.We studied 53 patients with ulcerative colitis and 108 control subjects. The plasma platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase genotype was determined as representative cases with three different genotypes (GG, GT, and TT) by an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction.There was no significant difference in genotypic frequency (GG, GT, and TT genotype frequencies were 68, 30, and 2 percent in controls and 55, 45, and 0 percent in ulcerative colitis patients). Platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase activity in plasma was also measured and did not differ significantly between ulcerative colitis patients and controls (1.50+/-0.12 vs. 1.81+/-0.34 nmol/min/50 microl, P = 0.60). However, according to the relationship between the platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase gene mutation and clinical characteristics of ulcerative colitis patients, the operative ratio cause of unresponsiveness to steroid therapy was significantly higher in patients with the GT genotype than in those with the GG genotype (66.7 vs. 27.6 percent, P = 0.019).We conclude that steroid-nonresponsive ulcerative colitis patients have a high frequency of the platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase gene mutation.

Although several predisposing factors have been identified, such as prematurity, enteral feeding, and infection, its pathogenesis remains elusive. In the past 20 years, we have established several animal models of NEC in rats and found several endogenous mediators, especially platelet-activating factor (PAF), which may play a pivotal role in NEC. Injection of PAF induces intestinal necrosis, and PAF antagonists prevent the  injury induced by bacterial endotoxin, hypoxia, or challenge with tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF) plus endotoxin in adult rats. The same is true for lesions induced by hypoxia and enteral feeding in neonatal animals. Human patients with NEC show high levels of PAF and decreased plasma PAF-acetylhydrolase, the enzyme degrading PAF. The initial event in our experimental models of NEC is probably polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) activation and adhesion to venules in the intestine, which initiates a local  reaction involving proinflammatory mediators including TNF, complement, prostaglandins, and leukotriene C4. Subsequent norepinephrine release and mesenteric vasoconstriction result in splanchnic ischemia and reperfusion. Bacterial products (e.g., endotoxin) enter the intestinal tissue during local mucosal barrier breakdown, and endotoxin synergizes with PAF to amplify the inflammation. Reactive oxygen species produced by the activated leukocytes and by intestinal epithelial xanthine oxidase may be the final pathway for tissue injury. Protective mechanisms include nitric oxide produced by the constitutive (mainly neuronal) nitric oxide synthase, and indigenous probiotics such as Bifidobacteria infantis. The former maintains intestinal perfusion and the integrity of the mucosal barrier, and the latter keep virulent bacteria in check. The development of tissue injury depends on the balance between injurious and protective mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1972295>Platelet-activating factor--a possible mediator in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis.</a></h2><p>Release of platelet-activating factor (PAF) by cultured colonic mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis and healthy controls was determined.

In vitro measurements included myeloperoxidase activity, plasma corticosterone levels, interleukin 1 beta messenger RNA expression, and [3H]noradrenaline release from the myenteric plexus.Six weeks after administration of TNBS, stress caused a significant increase in myeloperoxidase activity in TNBS-treated rats but not in stressed controls; plasma corticosterone responses were similar. Stress also caused an exaggerated and significant suppression of [3H]noradrenaline release in TNBS-treated stressed rats compared with stressed controls. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in interleukin 1 beta messenger RNA expression in the colon.Previous colitis rendered the colon more susceptible to effects of stress on enteric nerve function and also increased some parameters of inflammation in response to stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14671485>The intestinal anti- activity of UR-12746S on reactivated experimental colitis is mediated through downregulation of cytokine production.</a></h2><p>UR-12746S (dersalazine sodium) is cleaved by colonic bacteria delivering the PAF antagonist UR-12715 and 5-ASA. This study describes the anti- activity of UR-12746S in an experimental model of reactivated colitis and its effects on cytokine production.Rats were initially rendered colitic by a colonic instillation of 10 mg of trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS) dissolved in 0.25 ml of 50 % ethanol, and colitis was reactivated two weeks after by a second administration of the same dose of TNBS. Two groups of colitic rats received UR-12746S (25 and 50 mg/kg daily, p.o.) and colonic damage was evaluated every week for 4 weeks. Different biochemical markers of colonic inflammation were assayed: MPO activity and cytokine (IL-1beta and TNFalpha) levels. Also, the in vitro effects of UR-12715 and 5-ASA on cytokine production were assayed.UR-12746S showed anti- effect in reactivated colitis in rats, as evidenced by a significant reduction in MPO activity. Both doses of UR-12746S decreased IL-1beta production, while only the highest dose assayed inhibited TNFalpha production. In vitro studies revealed that UR-12715 or 5-ASA (from 10(-6) to 10(-4) M) inhibited IL-8 production (30-40%) in HT-29 cells when incubated with LPS. This inhibitory effect was enhanced when both compounds were administered simultaneously at 10(-4) M. In addition, UR-12715 inhibited IL-1beta or TNFalpha production in THP-1 or U937 cells, respectively, when these cells were stimulated by PMA and LPS; whereas 5-ASA only showed a weak effect in inhibiting IL-1beta production.UR-12746S was able to prevent relapse in experimental colitis and inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production participates in the intestinal anti- activity exerted by this compound.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17112600>Disturbed in vitro adrenergic modulation of cytokine production in  in remission.</a></h2><p>Psychological stress has been implicated in the pathophysiology of both  and functional gastrointestinal (GI) . The goal of this study was to address neuroendocrine modulation of cytokine production by peripheral blood cells in GI .We analyzed the in vitro effects of the beta-adrenergic agonist terbutaline and the glucocorticoid agonist dexamethasone on TNF-alpha and IL-10 production by LPS-stimulated monocytes in whole cell blood cultures in patients with  in remission (N=10), diarrhoea-predominant irritable  syndrome (IBS, N=12), patients with a recent gastroenteritis (post-infectious group, N=10), and healthy controls (N=15).In response to terbutaline, there was a significant increase in IL-10 production (concentration effect: p<0.05), which was diminished in IBD (group effect: p<0.01), comparable in IBS and controls, but enhanced in the post-infectious group (group x concentration effect: p<0.05). In contrast, terbutaline resulted in a concentration-dependent suppression of TNF-alpha production, which was comparable in all groups. Dexamethasone suppressed TNF-alpha production in a dose-dependent manner in all groups, but this effect was significantly more pronounced in post-infectious subjects (group effect: p<0.05).In IBD, disturbed adrenergic regulation of IL-10 could be part of the mechanism(s) underlying the modulation of  activity by psychological stress. Diarrhoea-predominant IBS was not associated with altered adrenergic or glucocorticoid regulation of cytokine production by peripheral blood cells, whereas a recent history of gastroenteritis was associated with disturbed neuroendocrine modulation of cytokine production, which may play role in the pathophysiology of post-infectious IBS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19714753>Platelet-activating factor-induced NF-kappaB activation and IL-8 production in intestinal epithelial cells are Bcl10-dependent.</a></h2><p>Platelet-activating factor (PAF), a potent proinflammatory phospholipid mediator, has been implicated in inducing intestinal inflammation in  such as  (IBD) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). However, its mechanisms of inducing  responses are not fully understood. Therefore, studies were designed to explore the mechanisms of PAF-induced  cascade in intestinal epithelial cells.Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation was measured by luciferase assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and interleukin 8 (IL-8) production was determined by ELISA. B-cell lymphoma 10 (Bcl10), caspase recruitment domain-containing membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein 3 (CARMA3), and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) mRNA and protein levels were assessed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. siRNA silencing of Bcl10 was used to examine its role in PAF-induced NF-kappaB activation and IL-8 production. The promoter region of the Bcl10 gene was cloned with the PCR method and promoter activity measured by luciferase assay.The adaptor protein Bcl10 appeared to play an important role in the PAF-induced  pathway in human intestinal epithelial cells. Bcl10 was required for PAF-induced I kappaB alpha phosphorylation, NF-kappaB activation, and IL-8 production in NCM460, a cell line derived from normal human colon, and Caco-2, a transformed human intestinal cell line. PAF also stimulated Bcl10 interactions with CARMA3 and MALT1, and upregulated Bcl10 expression in these cells via transcriptional regulation.These findings highlight a novel PAF-induced  pathway in intestinal epithelial cells, requiring Bcl10 as a critical mediator and involving CARMA3/Bcl10/MALT1 interactions. The proinflammatory effects of PAF play prominent roles in the pathogenesis of IBD and this pathway may present important targets for intervention in chronic   of the intestine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1665291> mediators in cotton-top tamarins (CTT) with acute and chronic colitis.</a></h2><p>Spontaneous colitis in CTT's presents cytological characteristics similar to chronic ulcerative colitis in humans, e.g.  cell infiltrate and crypt abscesses. To better characterize CTT colitis as a potential model for human  (IBD),  mediators identified in colonic tissue of human IBD patients and/or experimental colitis models were assayed.  mediator changes in plasma and colon from tamarins with acute (n = 10) and chronic (n = 10) colitis (by mucosal biopsy) were assayed by RIAs. Similar  mediators were found in the CTT's with acute colitis. In the plasma, PAF and PGE2 levels were lower in acute colitis CTT's, no LTB4 was detected, and histamine levels were not different from chronic colitic animals. In the colon, myeloperoxidase and interleukin-1 beta were significantly higher in acute colitis, PGE2 and LTB4 were higher but not significantly, and PAF was not different from chronic CTT's. These data suggest that a combination of events are occurring in the pathogenesis of tamarin colitis that involves some of the same mediators that are found in the human  and in other experimental models. The importance of these findings to human IBD remains for further investigation; however, the spontaneous primate model offers an exciting approximation of the  development and merits further investigation for understanding the pathogenesis of human IBD as well as to aid in development of targeted therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18346685>Management of lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding.</a></h2><p>Acute bleeding from the colon and rectum is less frequent and less dramatic than haemorrhage from the upper gastrointestinal tract. In most cases, bleeding from the colon and rectum is self-limiting and requires no specific therapy. Diverticula and angiectasias are the most frequent sources of bleeding. Malignancy, colitis (, non-steroidal anti- drugs, and infectious colitis), ischaemia, anorectal disorders, postpolypectomy bleeding, and HIV-related problems are less frequent causes. The recurrence rate, especially in diverticular bleeding, is high. Resuscitation and haemodynamic stabilisation of the patient is the first step in the management of colonic bleeding. Urgent colonoscopy is the method of choice for diagnosis and therapy. By analogy with peptic ulcer bleeding, risk stratification using stigmata of haemorrhage is gaining more importance. Modern endoscopic techniques such as injection therapy, thermocoagulation and mechanical devices seem to be effective in achieving haemostasis and avoiding precarious surgery. Angiography and nuclear scintigraphy are reserved for those patients in whom colonoscopy is not possible or has repeatedly failed to localise the bleeding site.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8381760>Octreotide effectively decreases mucosal damage in experimental colitis.</a></h2><p>The effect of octreotide, a synthetic analogue of somatostatin, on the modulation of the acetic acid model of experimental colitis was examined. Colitis was induced by intracolonic administration of 2 ml of 5% acetic acid. The  response elicited by the acetic acid resulted in increased colonic synthesis of platelet activating factor, leukotriene B4 and decreased mucosal somatostatin levels. Subcutaneous administration of octreotide (10 micrograms/rat) 1 hour before or immediately after damage induction, as well as 1 and 23 hours after acetic acid application, resulted in a significant reduction in mucosal damage. The protective effect was accompanied by a significant reduction in platelet activating factor activity, leukotriene B4, and vasoactive intestinal peptide concentrations. There were no significant changes in mucosal leukotriene C4 and calcitonin gene related peptide levels. This study shows that acetic acid induced colitis is pharmacologically manipulated by octreotide. The mechanism of action of octreotide has not yet been fully determined.

The discovery that a different microbial composition can influence behavior and cognition, and in turn the nervous system can indirectly influence enteric microbiota composition, has significantly contributed to establish the well-accepted concept of gut-brain axis. This hypothesis is supported by several evidence showing mutual mechanisms, which involve the vague nerve, the immune system, the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis modulation and the bacteria-derived metabolites. Many studies have focused on delineating a role for this axis in health and , ranging from stress-related disorders such as depression, anxiety and irritable  syndrome (IBS) to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, and to neurodegenerative , such as Parkinson , Alzheimer's  etc. Based on this background, and considering the relevance of alteration of the symbiotic state between host and microbiota, this review focuses on the role and the involvement of bioactive lipids, such as the N-acylethanolamine (NAE) family whose main members are N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA), palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoilethanolamide (OEA), and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, belonging to a large group of bioactive lipids able to modulate peripheral and central pathologic processes. Their effective role has been studied in inflammation, acute and chronic pain, obesity and central nervous system . A possible correlation has been shown between these lipids and gut microbiota through different mechanisms. Indeed, systemic administration of specific bacteria can reduce abdominal pain through the involvement of cannabinoid receptor 1 in the rat; on the other hand, PEA reduces inflammation markers in a murine model of  (IBD), and butyrate, producted by gut microbiota, is effective in reducing inflammation and pain in irritable  syndrome and IBD animal models. In this review, we underline the relationship among inflammation, pain, microbiota and the different lipids, focusing on a possible involvement of NAEs and SCFAs in the gut-brain axis and their role in the central nervous system .Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9431894>Specific mediator-directed therapy for gastrointestinal .</a></h2><p>A number of  mediators--such as proinflammatory cytokines, lipid derived eicosanoids and reactive oxygen metabolites--are elevated in chronic  inflammation.

The aim of this study was to determine mucosal gastric and colonic generation of vasoactive substances, because they may contribute to the altered mucosal function. Rats with partial vein ligation (n = 7), complete bile duct ligation (n = 6) and sham-operated rats (n = 10) were studied. Three weeks following surgery rats were anesthetized, splenic pulp pressure was measured, stomachs and colons were removed and mucosa was extracted for determination of prostaglandin E2, thromboxane B2, leukotriene B4, leukotriene C4 and endothelin-1 by radioimmunoassay (ng/g) and platelet activating factor activity (pg/10 mg) by platelet aggregation. Pulp pressure was > 13 mmHg in partial vein ligated rats and bile duct ligated rats and 6 mmHg in sham-operated rats. No macroscopic or microscopic lesions were seen any of the removed tissues. Gastric mucosal prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2 generation were decreased by 35% and 7%, respectively, in bile duct ligated rats (bile duct ligated versus sham-operated, p < 0.05 for prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2). Gastric leukotriene B4 and C4 generation, platelet activating factor activity and endothelin-1 content did not differ significantly among the three groups. A different pattern of changes was observed in the colon. Colonic leukotriene B4 generation and endothelin-1 content were increased in bile duct ligated rats by 105% and 210%, respectively (bile duct ligated versus sham-operated, p < 0.05 for leukotriene B4 and endothelin-1). The decreased gastric mucosal prostaglandin E2 generation of bile duct ligated rats may render the gut mucosa of these animals relatively ischemic and vulnerable to damage by noxious agents. The increased colonic leukotriene B4 generation and the increased endothelin-1 content of the colonic mucosa of bile duct ligated rats may promote  and ischemic changes in the colonic mucosa and may enable bacterial translocation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1347599>Paf-acether in stool as marker of intestinal inflammation.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21810260>Anti- effects of nicotine in obesity and ulcerative colitis.</a></h2><p>Cigarette smoke is a major risk factor for a number of  including lung cancer and respiratory infections. Paradoxically, it also contains nicotine, an anti- alkaloid. There is increasing evidence that smokers have a lower incidence of some  , including ulcerative colitis, and the protective effect involves the activation of a cholinergic anti- pathway that requires the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) on immune cells. Obesity is characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation, which contributes to insulin resistance. Nicotine significantly improves glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in genetically obese and diet-induced obese mice, which is associated with suppressed adipose tissue inflammation. Inflammation that results in disruption of the epithelial barrier is a hallmark of , and nicotine is protective in ulcerative colitis. This article summarizes current evidence for the anti- effects of nicotine in obesity and ulcerative colitis. Selective agonists for the α7nAChR could represent a promising pharmacological strategy for the treatment of inflammation in obesity and ulcerative colitis. Nevertheless, we should keep in mind that the anti- effects of nicotine could be mediated via the expression of several nAChRs on a particular target cell.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27609529>Faecal and Serum Metabolomics in Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is considered to result from the interplay between host and intestinal microbiota but its pathogenesis is incompletely understood. While IBD in adults has shown to be associated with marked changes in body fluid metabolomics, there are only few studies in children. Hence, this prospective study addressed the faecal and serum metabolomics in newly diagnosed paediatric IBD.Paediatric patients with IBD undergoing diagnostic endoscopies and controls also with endoscopy but no signs of inflammation provided blood and stool samples in a tertiary care hospital. Blood inflammatory markers and faecal calprotectin levels were determined. The serum and faecal metabolomics were determined using ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer.Serum and faecal metabolite profiles in newly diagnosed paediatric IBD patients were different from healthy controls and categorized Crohn's disease and ulcerative  [UC] patients into separate groups. In serum, amino acid metabolism, folate biosynthesis and signalling pathways were perturbed in Crohn's disease; in UC also sphingolipid metabolic pathways were perturbed when compared to controls. In faecal samples, there was an increased level of several metabolites in UC in contrast to low or intermediate levels in Crohn's disease. There was a clear correlation with the level of inflammation, i.e. faecal calprotectin levels and the profile of various biologically important metabolites [carnosine, ribose and, most significantly, choline].Characterization of inflammatory pattern using metabolomics analysis is a promising tool for better understanding disease pathogenesis of paediatric IBD.Copyright © 2016 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

It activates neutrophils that are needed to initiate the  response. Macrophage  protein-2 (MIP-2), a critical C-X-C chemokine secreted by macrophages and epithelial cells, is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils. Whereas MIP-2 has been previously shown to mediate the injury in various organs, its role in acute intestinal injury has never been assessed. In this study, we first investigated the effect of PAF on MIP-2 expression in the intestine. Anesthetized young adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intravenously with either PAF (1.5 microg/kg) or saline. Sixty minutes later, ileal MIP-2 gene expression was determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR, and plasma and ileal MIP-2 protein was determined by ELISA. In a second step, we assessed the role of MIP-2 in PAF-induced  injury. Rats were pretreated with rabbit anti-rat MIP-2 antibodies or control IgG for 90 min and then injected intravenously with PAF (2.5 microg/kg) for 90 min. We found that, in the rat intestine, 1) MIP-2 mRNA was only minimally expressed constitutively in sham-operated animals; 2) MIP-2 mRNA was significantly upregulated in response to PAF; 3) MIP-2 protein plasma levels and local production of MIP-2 in the ileum were markedly induced by PAF; 4) the administration of anti-rat MIP-2 IgG, but not control rabbit IgG, markedly reduced PAF-induced  injury (injury scores of 0.19 +/- 0.09 vs. 1.12 +/- 0.43, P < 0.05), hypotension, and leukopenia but did not reduce PAF-induced hemoconcentration. Thus we conclude that MIP-2 mediates PAF-induced intestinal injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21790535>The intestinal anti- effect of dersalazine sodium is related to a down-regulation in IL-17 production in experimental models of rodent colitis.</a></h2><p>Dersalazine sodium (DS) is a new chemical entity formed by combining, through an azo bond, a potent platelet activating factor (PAF) antagonist (UR-12715) with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA).

The aim of this study was to further characterize the anti- effects of DS.Effect of DS (10 or 30 mg·kg(-1) b.i.d.) on TNBS-induced colitis in rats was studied after 2 and 7 days with special focus on  mediators. Additionally, its anti- properties were analysed in two different models of dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced colitis, BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, the latter being dependent on IL-17.DS, when administered for 7 days, showed intestinal anti- effects in TNBS-induced colitis; these effects were observed both macroscopically and through the profile of  mediators (TNF, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-17). Although the 2 day treatment with DS did not induce intestinal anti- effects, it was sufficient to reduce the enhanced IL-17 expression. DS showed beneficial effects on DSS-induced colitis in C57BL/6 mice and reduced colonic pro- cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-17. In contrast, it did not exert intestinal anti- effects on DSS-induced colitis in BALB/c mice.DS exerts intestinal anti- activity in different rodent models of colitis through down-regulation of IL-17 expression.© 2011 The Authors.

Rats were treated with a specific PAF-acether antagonist, BN52021, during the first 4 days after induction of colitis, or during the period of 4-7 days after induction of colitis. The effects of treatment with BN52021 were compared to those of treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid. BN52021 and 5-aminosalicyclic acid were without significant effect on colonic damage score when administered intracolonically on days 1-4 after induction of colitis. However, when given on days 4-7 after induction of colitis, both drugs significantly accelerated the healing of ulcers and reduced the incidence of adhesions and diarrhea. Intraperitoneal administration of BN52021 also resulted in a significant reduction of colonic damage scores, while administration of 5-aminosalicyclic acid via this route was without significant effect. Using an in vitro superfusion system, the effects of PAF-acether on contractility of segments of ascending colon were assessed. Tissue segments from normal rats contracted to doses of PAF-acether as low as 0.5 pg. However, non-inflamed segments of ascending colon from rats in which colitis was induced 2 weeks earlier were relatively insensitive to PAF-acether. The results of the present study demonstrate that PAF-acether is unlikely to play an important role in the acute  response in this model, but may be important in the prolongation of inflammation and ulceration in this model. The studies on contractility of ascending colon suggest that changes in tissue sensitivity to PAF-acether may occur as a consequence of inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16498637>Glutathione-enhancing agents protect against steatohepatitis in a dietary model.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and steatohepatitis (NASH) may accompany obesity, diabetes, parenteral nutrition, jejeuno-ileal bypass, and chronic . Currently there is no FDA approved and effective therapy available. We investigated the potential efficacy of those agents that stimulate glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis on the development of experimental steatohepatitis. Rats fed (ad libitum) amino acid based methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet were further gavaged with (1) vehicle (MCD), (2) S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), or (3) 2(RS)-n-propylthiazolidine-4(R)-carboxylic acid (PTCA).MCD diet significantly reduced hematocrit, and this abnormality improved in the treated groups (p < 0.01). Serum transaminases were considerably elevated (AST: 5.8-fold; ALT: 3.22-fold) in MCD rats. However, administration of GSH-enhancing agents significantly suppressed these abnormal enzyme activities. MCD rats developed severe liver pathology manifested by fatty degeneration, inflammation, and necrosis, which significantly improved with therapy. Blood levels of GSH were significantly depleted in MCD rats but normalized in the treated groups. Finally, RT-PCR measurements showed a significant upregulation of genes involved in tissue remodeling and fibrosis (matrix metalloproteinases, collagen-alpha1), suppressor of cytokines signaling1, and the  cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and TGF-beta) in the livers of rats fed MCD.

However, several studies indicate that the immunosuppressive properties of FTY720 may alternatively be due to tolerogenic activities via modulation of dendritic cell differentiation or based on direct effects on CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Treg). As Treg play an important role for the cure of  colitis, we used the Th1-mediated 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis model to address the therapeutic potential of FTY720 in vivo. A rectal enema of TNBS was given to BALB/c mice. FTY720 was administered i.p. from days 0 to 3 or 3 to 5. FTY720 substantially reduced all clinical, histopathologic, macroscopic, and microscopic parameters of colitis analyzed. The therapeutic effects of FTY720 were associated with a down-regulation of IL-12p70 and subsequent Th1 cytokines. Importantly, FTY720 treatment resulted in a prominent up-regulation of FoxP3, IL-10, TGFbeta, and CTLA4. Supporting the hypothesis that FTY720 directly affects functional activity of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg, we measured a significant increase of CD25 and FoxP3 expression in isolated lamina propria CD4(+) T cells of FTY720-treated mice. The impact of FTY720 on Treg induction was further confirmed by concomitant in vivo blockade of CTLA4 or IL-10R which significantly abrogated its therapeutic activity. In conclusion, our data provide clear evidence that in addition to its well-established effects on migration FTY720 leads to a specific down-regulation of proinflammatory signals while simultaneously inducing functional activity of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg. Thus, FTY720 may offer a promising new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17876892>Exogenous sphingomyelinase causes impaired intestinal epithelial barrier function.</a></h2><p>To test the hypothesis that hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide changes the composition of tight junctions (TJs) with increasing permeability of the intestinal epithelium.Monolayers of Caco-2 cells were used as an in vitro model for the intestinal barrier. Permeability was determined by quantification of transepithelial flux and transepithelial resistance. Sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains were isolated by a discontinuous sucrose gradient and characterized by Western-blot. Lipid content of microdomains was analysed by tandem mass spectrometry. Ceramide was subcellularly localized by immunofluorescent staining.Exogenous sphingomyelinase increased transepithelial permeability and decreased transepithelial resistance at concentrations as low as 0.01 U/mL. Lipid analysis showed rapid accumulation of ceramide in the membrane fractions containing occludin and claudin-4, representing TJs. In these fractions we observed a concomitant decrease of sphingomyelin and cholesterol with increasing concentrations of ceramide. Immunofluorescent staining confirmed clustering of ceramide at the sites of cell-cell contacts. Neutralization of surface ceramide prevented the permeability-increase induced by platelet activating factor.Our findings indicate that changes in lipid composition of TJs impair epithelial barrier functions.

The in vitro beta-adrenergic stimulation of PBCs revealed reduced IL-10 response in UC.Psychosocial stress-induced activation of the neuroendocrine and sympatho-adrenal systems remain unaltered in UC, suggesting that the mechanism(s) mediating effects of psychological stress on  activity are likely operative downstream at the level of the intestine. However, UC patients show disturbances in basal endocrine and cytokine measures. Together with our in vitro evidence of disturbed adrenergic regulation of IL-10 production by stimulated PBCs in UC, these may indicate the existence of subtle disturbance of peripheral cellular neuroendocrine-immune interactions in UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5313428>Selective arterial infusions of vasoconstrictors in acute gastrointestinal bleeding.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8239981>Eicosanoids. Critical agents in the physiological process and cellular injury.</a></h2><p>Eicosanoids were discovered as "prostaglandins" in the mid-1930s. The discovery that eicosanoids were ubiquitous in mammalian cells and that nonsteroidal anti- drugs worked by inhibiting enzymes that synthesized these chemicals heralded their extensive investigation in all fields of biology. Precursor fatty acids (arachidonic acids) are stored in cell phospholipids, acted on by two enzymes (cyclooxygenase and lipooxygenase) that yield prostaglandins, thromboxane, prostacyclin, and leukotrienes. Knowledge of their biochemical processes continue to unfold, but it is now believed that eicosanoids are part of a larger group of agents termed phospholipid mediators. Eicosanoids are intimately involved with cardiovascular function as well as central and peripheral vascular  processes and ischemia. In the gastrointestinal tract, these potent lipids not only participate in many normal functions (eg, acid secretion and motility) but also in  states (eg,  and peptic ulcer ). In shocklike states of sepsis and/or endotoxemia, eicosanoids have assumed a major role in many events that occur. Recently, discoveries have demonstrated that platelet-activating and tumor necrosis factors exert their effects in part through eicosanoids. The future will demonstrate these compounds to be critical not only in intracellular (molecular) events but also in the effects they produce that are far from the source of origin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15590261>Treatment of refractory mesenteric traction syndrome without cyclooxygenase inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Mesenteric traction may be necessary for surgical exposure during colonic or aortic surgery. Traction on the mesentery releases prostacyclin, producing variable degrees of hypotension. Numerous cases of severe, life-threatening hypotension have been reported. The published literature suggests that treatment of severe hypotension from mesenteric traction with routine doses of vasoconstrictors may be ineffective, but inhibition of prostacyclin synthesis with cyclooxygenase inhibitors can successfully treat or prevent hypotension. This rationale, while highly beneficial, would place patients with allergies to cyclooxygenase inhibitors at a severe disadvantage, and would also leave no therapeutic options if intravenous cyclooxygenase inhibitors were not immediately available.

Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry demonstrated constitutive expression of alpha 4 beta 7 by eosinophils. Expression of alpha 4 beta 7 or alpha 4 beta 7 was not enhanced by eosinophil activation with platelet-activating factor (PAF). Expression of alpha 4 beta 7 was confirmed by immuno-precipitation of 125I-labeled lysates analysed by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE). Approximately 20% of unstimulated eosinophils were adherent to L1-2 cells transfected with vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) cDNA, while very few resting eosinophils adhered to mouse mucosal adressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) transfectants. Binding of unstimulated eosinophils to VCAM-1 transfectant was inhibited by HPI 2 (an antibody that blocks both alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 4 beta 7 functions), but not Act-1, and alpha 4 beta 1 monoclonal antibody (mAb). PAF stimulation resulted in increased binding of eosinophils to MAdCAM-1 transfectants, which was inhibited by both HPI 2 and Act-1. In contrast, PAF did not enhance binding to VCAM 1 transfectants, although binding of PAE-stimulated eosinophils to VCAM-1 could be partially inhibited by Act-1. Stimulation of eosinophils with the beta 7-activating mAb TS2 16 resulted in enhanced binding of eosinophils to both VCAM-1 and MAdCAM-1 transfectants. The increased binding was largely alpha 4 beta 7-dependent. Unstimulated eosinophils bound to soluble recombinant human (rh) VCAM-1 and fibronectin (Fn), coated on 96-well plates in dose-dependent manner. Binding was inhibited by HPI-2 and 4b4, an anti-beta 1 mAb, but not by Act-1. TS2 16 treatment increased adherent cell numbers and this enhanced binding was inhibited by Act-1. We have therefore confirmed that alpha 4 beta 7 is functionally active on unstimulated eosinophils. In contrast, PAF-induced enhancement of eosinophils binding to VCAM-1 or MAdCAM-1 was alpha 4 beta 7-dependent. In addition treatment with TS2 16 resulted in a alpha 4 beta 7-dependent enhancement of eosinophil binding to VCAM-1, MAdCAM-1 and Fn. We therefore hypothesize that alpha 4 beta 7 may have an important role in eosinophil localization in  such as asthma and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9713457>Bronchiectasis in association with coeliac .</a></h2><p>A 48 year old woman presented with a history of fatigue, regular sputum production, and wheeze.

Six weekly 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid enemas were given to establish colitis and temporal gene expression patterns were obtained at 6-, 8-, 10-, and 12-wk time points. The 6-wk point, TNBS-w6, was the active, chronic  stage of the model marked by macrophage, neutrophil, and CD3(+) and CD4(+) T cell infiltrates in the colon, consistent with the idea that this model is T cell immune response driven. Proinflammatory genes Cxcl1, Ccl2, Il1b, Lcn2, Pla2g2a, Saa3, S100a9, Nos2, Reg2, and Reg3g, and profibrogenic extracellular matrix genes Col1a1, Col1a2, Col3a1, and Lum (lumican), encoding a collagen-associated proteoglycan, were up-regulated at the active/chronic  stages. Rectal administration of the NF-kappaB p65 antisense oligonucleotide reduced but did not abrogate inflammation and fibrosis completely. The antisense oligonucleotide treatment reduced total NF-kappaB by 60% and down-regulated most proinflammatory genes. However, Ccl2, a proinflammatory chemokine known to promote fibrosis, was not down-regulated. Among extracellular matrix gene expressions Lum was suppressed while Col1a1 and Col3a1 were not.

Therefore, an in vitro organ bath technique was developed to investigate the simultaneous effects of inflammation on permeability and smooth muscle contractility in different segments of the colon.BALB/c mice were exposed to a 10% dextran sulphate sodium drinking water solution for 7 days to induce a mild colitis, while control mice received normal tap water. Intestinal segments were placed in an oxygenated organ bath containing Krebs buffer. Permeability was measured by the transport of the marker molecules 3H-mannitol and 14C-polyethyleneglycol 4000. Contractility was measured through a pressure sensor. Smooth muscle relaxation was obtained by salbutamol and l-phenylephrine, whereas contraction was achieved by carbachol and 1-(3-chlorophenyl)-biguanide.The intensity of mucosal inflammation increased throughout the colon. Also, regional differences were observed in intestinal permeability. In both normal and inflamed distal colon segments, permeability was diminished compared with proximal colon segments and the non-inflamed ileum. Permeability in inflamed distal colon segments was significantly decreased compared with normal distal segments. Pharmacologically induced relaxation of smooth muscles did not affect this diminished permeability, although an increased motility positively affected permeability in inflamed and non-inflamed distal colon.Inflammation and permeability is inversely related.

Platelet-activating factor induces severe pathological changes in various organs and, among numerous potent effects, causes  necrosis. Pouchitis is a poorly understood complication of ileoanal pouch anastomosis which occurs in patients who undergo surgery for ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to measure ileal or fecal platelet-activating factor and lyso platelet-activating factor contents in normal volunteers (n = 12), in patients with terminal ileostomy (n = 7), and in patients with ileoanal anastomosis (n = 15) (8 patients have pouchitis defined by the presence of ulcerations on the reservoir). Fecal samples were processed and assessed for platelet-activating factor by platelet aggregation assay. The aggregating material was further characterized as platelet-activating factor by the following: inhibition of the platelet aggregation it induced by specific platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist (BN 52021; IHB, Le Plessis Robinson, France); abolition of platelet aggregation after incubation with phospholipase A2 but not with lipase A1; and retention time on high-performance liquid chromatography. Stool platelet-activating factor content (in nanograms per gram of stool, mean +/- 1SD) was significantly increased in patients with pouchitis (22.2 +/- 16 ng/g) compared with patients with normal reservoir (1.59 +/- 0.63 ng/g, P less than 0.01), terminal ileostomy (0.59 +/- 0.43 ng/g, P less than 0.01), and healthy controls (0 +/- 0 ng/g of stool, P less than 0.001). Lyso platelet-activating factor (nanograms per gram of stool) was increased in patients with pouchitis (10,704 +/- 5499 ng/g) compared with patients with normal reservoir (4721 +/- 4549 ng/g of stool, P less than 0.05), terminal ileostomy (3042 +/- 4019 ng/g, P less than 0.02), and healthy volunteers (128 +/- 107 ng/g, P less than 0.001).

Recently we reported that one of the serotonin-fatty acid conjugates, docosahexaenoyl serotonin (DHA-5-HT), previously found in gut tissue of mouse and pig, attenuates the IL-23-IL-17 signaling axis in LPS-stimulated mice macrophages. However, its presence and effects in humans remained to be elucidated. Here, we report for the first time its identification in human intestinal (colon) tissue, along with a series of related N-acyl serotonins. Furthermore, we tested these fatty acid conjugates for their ability to inhibit the release of IL-17 and CCL-20 by stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Serotonin conjugates with palmitic acid (PA-5-HT), stearic acid (SA-5-HT) and oleic acid (OA-5-HT) were detected in higher levels than arachidonoyl serotonin (AA-5-HT) and DHA-5-HT, while eicosapentaenoyl serotonin (EPA-5-HT) could not be quantified. Among these, DHA-5-HT was the most potent in inhibiting IL-17 and CCL-20, typical Th17 pro-inflammatory mediators, by Concanavalin A (ConA)-stimulated human PBMCs. These results underline the idea that DHA-5-HT is a gut-specific endogenously produced mediator with the capacity to modulate the IL-17/Th17 signaling response.

In this study, we investigated whether this upregulation is a marker also of celiac -induced atrophy. The levels of the cannabinoid CB(1) receptor, of the endocannabinoids, anandamide, and 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG), and of the anti- mediator palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) were analyzed in bioptic samples from the duodenal mucosa of celiac patients at first diagnosis assessed by the determination of antiendomysial antibodies and histological examination. Samples were analyzed during the active phase of atrophy and after remission and compared to control samples from non-celiac patients. The levels of anandamide and PEA were significantly elevated (approx. 2- and 1.8-fold, respectively) in active celiac patients and so were those of CB(1) receptors. Anandamide levels returned to normal after remission with a gluten-free diet. We also analyzed endocannabinoid and PEA levels in the jejunum of rats 2, 3, and 7 days after treatment with methotrexate, which causes  features (assessed by histopathological analyses and myeloperoxidase activity) similar to those of celiac patients. In both muscle/serosa and mucosa layers, the levels of anandamide, 2-AG, and PEA peaked 3 days after treatment and returned to basal levels at remission, 7 days after treatment. Thus, intestinal endocannabinoid levels peak with atrophy and regress with remission in both celiac patients and methotrexate-treated rats.

AM (50 ng/kg/day) was administered i.p. daily, starting 24h after trinitrobenzensulfonic acid (TNBS, 30 mg) instillation. After 14 days, rats were sacrificed, colons were macroscopically analyzed and biochemical parameters (myeloperoxidase activity, cytokines, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression) were determined. Vascular function of small mesenteric arteries was assessed by addition of phenylephrine (10⁻⁸ to 10⁻⁴ mol/L) and participation of COX and NOS pathways was also evaluated by using different inhibitors: indomethacin, NS-398, L-NNA, and 1400 w. Chronic AM treatment significantly reduced colonic macroscopic damage and inflammation markers. TNBS instillation induced COX-2 and iNOS expressions in colon and small mesenteric arteries; AM treatment decreased COX-2 expression only in microvessels from rats with colitis. An attenuation of phenylephrine-induced contraction was detected in small mesenteric arteries from both TNBS and AM-treated rats. COX and NOS inhibitors altered the contractile ability of phenylephrine in small mesenteric arteries from TNBS rats, suggesting the involvement of COX-2 and iNOS derived factors in the deleterious effect of TNBS on vascular reactivity; AM administration was able to reduce such alteration. Finally, treatment with the peptide significantly reduced colonic nitric oxide (NO) levels, without affecting plasma concentration. In conclusion, AM showed beneficial effects in the restoration of vascular function through the regulation of vasoactive products derived from COX-2 and iNOS.Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We have previously shown that the platelet-activating factor (PAF)-induced intestinal injury is attenuated by peptido-leukotriene antagonists, suggesting a role of PLA2. The purpose of this study is to examine the regulation of intestinal PLA2-II by PAF and LPS. Using synthesized competitor RNA as competitor, we quantified PLA2-II transcripts by competitive reverse transcription-PCR. We found that PLA2-II gene is constitutively expressed in the rat ileum. PAF at a dose (1.5 micrograms/kg) below that causing intestinal injury rapidly up-regulated intestinal PLA2-II at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, almost tripling its transcripts and significantly increasing enzyme activity in 30 min. LPS (5 mg/kg) also up-regulated PLA2-II. This effect could not be blocked by PAF antagonist. Depletion of circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) abolished the effect of PAF on PLA2-II gene expression and enzyme activation. In contrast, PMN depletion prevented LPS-induced PLA2-II enzyme activity but enhanced the gene expression. We conclude that: 1) both PAF and LPS induce gene transcription and enzyme activation of PLA2-II in the small intestine; 2) PAF up-regulates PLA2-II via PMN activation; 3) LPS effect is independent of endogenous PAF formation; and 4) different pathways exist for PAF and LPS in the regulation of intestinal PLA2-II gene expression in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25207649>Relationship between vagal tone, cortisol, TNF-alpha, epinephrine and negative affects in Crohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome.</a></h2><p>Crohn's disease (CD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) involve brain-gut dysfunctions where vagus nerve is an important component. The aim of this work was to study the association between vagal tone and markers of stress and inflammation in patients with CD or IBS compared to healthy subjects (controls). The study was performed in 73 subjects (26 controls, 21 CD in remission and 26 IBS patients). The day prior to the experiment, salivary cortisol was measured at 8:00 AM and 10:00 PM. The day of the experiment, subjects completed questionnaires for anxiety (STAI) and depressive symptoms (CES-D). After 30 min of rest, ECG was recorded for heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. Plasma cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, TNF-alpha and IL-6 were measured in blood samples taken at the end of ECG recording. Compared with controls, CD and IBS patients had higher scores of state-anxiety and depressive symptomatology. A subgroup classification based on HRV-normalized high frequency band (HFnu) as a marker of vagal tone, showed that control subjects with high vagal tone had significantly lower evening salivary cortisol levels than subjects with low vagal tone. Such an effect was not observed in CD and IBS patients. Moreover, an inverse association (r =  -0.48; p<0.05) was observed between the vagal tone and TNF-alpha level in CD patients exclusively. In contrast, in IBS patients, vagal tone was inversely correlated with plasma epinephrine (r =  -0.39; p<0.05). No relationship was observed between vagal tone and IL-6, norepinephrine or negative affects (anxiety and depressive symptomatology) in any group. In conclusion, these data argue for an imbalance between the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and the vagal tone in CD and IBS patients. Furthermore, they highlight the specific homeostatic link between vagal tone and TNF-alpha in CD and epinephrine in IBS and argue for the relevance of vagus nerve reinforcement interventions in those diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18514649>Endoscopic injection therapy for a bleeding exposed vessel in Crohn's .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15910891>Involvement of the cannabimimetic compound, N-palmitoyl-, in  and neuropathic conditions: review of the available pre-clinical data, and first human studies.</a></h2><p>The endogenous cannabimimetic compound, and anandamide analogue, N-palmitoyl- (PEA), was shown to exert potent anti- and analgesic effects in experimental models of visceral, neuropathic and  pain by acting via several possible mechanisms.

Hence, levels of PGE2, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-23, all pivotal macrophage-produced mediators driving the activation of pathogenic Th17 cells in a concerted way, were found to be significantly suppressed by concentrations as low as 100-500nM DHA-5-HT. Furthermore, DHA-5-HT inhibited the ability of RAW264.7 cells to migrate and downregulated chemokines like MCP-1, CCL-20, and gene-expression of CCL-22 and of several metalloproteinases. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) suggested negative overlap with gene sets linked to  (IBD) and positive overlap with gene sets related to the Nrf2 pathway. The specific formation of DHA-5-HT in the gut, combined with increasing data underlining the importance of the IL-23-IL-17 signaling pathway in the etiology of many chronic   merits further investigation into its potential as therapeutic compound in e.g. IBD or intestinal tumorigenesis.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Enhanced production during active  and inhibition by sulfasalazine and prednisolone.</a></h2><p>Platelet-activating factor is released from  cells. It activates neutrophils, releases secondary messengers, and mediates mucosal ulceration and ischemia in the rat. We assessed its possible role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. Colonic biopsy specimens from patients with active ulcerative colitis and controls were incubated for 4 h in Tyrode's buffer in the presence or absence of 0.2 microM calcium ionophore (A23187) or 50 microliter of antihuman immunoglobulin E. Platelet-activating factor was determined in the tissue by aggregation assay after extraction with 80% ethanol and was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography and its inactivation by phospholipases. Platelet-activating factor was not detected in normal mucosa. Only A23187 and antihuman immunoglobulin E stimulated its activity: mean +/- SE, 43.2 +/- 8.6 and 33.0 +/- 6.1 pg/10 mg wet wt, respectively. In active ulcerative colitis basal platelet-activating factor activity was 8.9 +/- 3.5 pg/10 mg wet wt. A23187 and antihuman immunoglobulin E induced significantly higher stimulation of platelet-activating factor synthesis when compared with their effects on normal mucosa: 200 +/- 28 and 70 +/- 8.3 pg/10 mg wet wt, respectively. The enhanced stimulation induced by A23187 was dose-dependently inhibited by salazopyrine, 5-amino-salicylic acid, and prednisolone, but not by sulfapyridine. It is thus suggested that platelet-activating factor may be involved in the pathogenesis of the  response in ulcerative colitis and that its inhibition by steroids, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and salazopyrine may be an additional mechanism to explain their therapeutic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8133910>Effect of a new de-N-acetyl-lysoglycosphingolipid on chemically-induced : possible mechanism of action.</a></h2><p>A new, orally active de-N-acetylated lysoglycosphingolipid (WILD20) was evaluated as antiinflammatory agent using a model of chemically-induced  (IBD) in the rat to mimic human ulcerative colitis and Chron's . IBD was induced by hapten trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNB). WILD20, orally administered as preventive or curative, was demonstrated to be efficacious at daily dosages of 0.1-1 mg/kg for 4-5 days. Damage scores, body weight, spleen weight, colonic tissular levels of LTB4, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) are influenced and brought into parameters of normality. Histological observation demonstrated quicker healing, better repair, reduced inflammation, and poor eosinophil degranulation.

The GM2 activator protein reversibly binds and solubilizes individual GM2 ganglioside molecules, making them available as substrate. Although GM2 ganglioside is the strongest binding ligand for the activator protein, it can also bind and transport between membranes a series of other glycolipids, even at neutral pH. Biosynthetic studies have shown that a large portion of newly synthesized GM2 activator molecules are not targeted to the lysosome, but are secreted and can then be recaptured by other cells through a carbohydrate independent mechanism. Thus, the GM2 activator protein may have other in vivo functions. We found that the GM2 activator protein can inhibit, through specific binding, the ability of platelet activating factor (PAF) to stimulate the release of intracellular Ca2+ pools by human neutrophils. PAF is a biologically potent phosphoacylglycerol. Inhibitors for PAF's role in the pathogenesis of  and asthma have been sought as potential therapeutic agents. The inherent stability and protease resistance of the small, monomeric GM2 activator protein, coupled with the ability to produce large quantities of the functional protein in transformed bacteria, suggest it may serve as such an agent.Copyright 1999 Academic Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25384424>N-Acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase inhibition increases colon N-palmitoylethanolamine levels and counteracts murine .</a></h2><p>N-Palmitoylethanolamine or palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an anti-inflammatory compound that was recently shown to exert peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α-dependent beneficial effects on colon inflammation. The actions of PEA are terminated following hydrolysis by 2 enzymes: fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), and the less-studied N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase (NAAA). This study aims to investigate the effects of inhibiting the enzymes responsible for PEA hydrolysis in colon inflammation in order to propose a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Two murine models of IBD were used to assess the effects of NAAA inhibition, FAAH inhibition, and PEA on macroscopic signs of colon inflammation, macrophage/neutrophil infiltration, and the expression of proinflammatory mediators in the colon, as well as on the -related systemic inflammation. NAAA inhibition increases PEA levels in the colon and reduces colon inflammation and systemic inflammation, similarly to PEA. FAAH inhibition, however, does not increase PEA levels in the colon and does not affect the macroscopic signs of colon inflammation or immune cell infiltration. This is the first report of an anti-inflammatory effect of a systemically administered NAAA inhibitor. Because NAAA is the enzyme responsible for the control of PEA levels in the colon, we put forth this enzyme as a potential therapeutic target in chronic inflammation in general and IBD in particular.© FASEB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29210147>Drug exposure and the risk of multiple sclerosis: A systematic review.</a></h2><p>Several environmental and lifestyle factors have been associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) risk, including some pharmacological treatments. We systematically reviewed the literature on prescription drug exposure and MS risk.Six databases were searched for original observational studies reporting drug exposure and MS risk published before 2017.Thirteen articles fulfilled inclusion criteria. Exposure to neither amiloride nor valproic acid was associated with MS (adjusted hazard ratio (adj.HR = 1.34;95% CI:0.81-2.20; adj.HR = 1.30;95%CI:0.44-3.80, respectively). Four studies explored oral contraceptive exposure and reported no association with MS; while a single study found an increased risk (odds ratio [adj.OR] = 1.52;95%CI:1.21-1.91). While penicillin exposure was associated with reduced risk of developing MS (adj.OR = 0.5;95%CI:0.3-0.9), a later study observed an elevated risk for penicillin (adj.OR = 1.21;95%CI:1.10-1.27) and all antibiotics (adj.OR = 1.41;95%CI:1.29-1.53), which was potentially attributed to underlying infection. Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) was not associated with MS risk in persons with inflammatory bowel disease (standard morbidity ratio = 4.2;95%CI:0.1-23.0) and arthritis (standardized incidence ratio = 1.38;95%CI:0.69-2.77); however, men exposed to anti-TNFα who also had arthritis and individuals with ankylosing spondylitis were at an increased risk (standardized incidence ratios = 3.91;95%CI:1.47-10.42 and 3.48;95%CI:1.45-8.37, respectively). A reduced risk of MS was observed with exposure to the beta2-adrenergic agonist fenoterol (adj.OR = 0.58;95%CI:0.45-0.76), and the sedating histamine 1-receptor antagonists (adj.OR = 0.2;95%CI:0.1-0.8), but not the non-sedating equivalent (adj.OR = 0.8;95%CI:0.4-1.6).The suggestion that some drugs may prevent MS is intriguing and warrants further study.

On this basis, we aimed to investigate anandamide metabolism in celiac  by analyzing transcript levels (through quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction), protein concentration (through immunoblotting) and activity (through radioassays) of enzymes responsible for anandamide synthesis (N-acylphosphatidyl- specific phospholipase D, NAPE-PLD) and degradation (fatty acid amide hydrolase, FAAH) in the duodenal mucosa of untreated celiac patients, celiac patients on a gluten-free diet for at least 12 months and control subjects. Also, treated celiac biopsies cultured ex vivo with peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin were investigated. Our in vivo experiments showed that mucosal NAPE-PLD expression and activity are higher in untreated celiac patients than treated celiac patients and controls, with no significant difference between the latter two groups. In keeping with the in vivo data, the ex vivo activity of NAPE-PLD was significantly enhanced by incubation of peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin with treated celiac biopsies. On the contrary, in vivo mucosal FAAH expression and activity did not change in the three groups of patients, and accordingly, mucosal FAAH activity was not influenced by treatment with peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin. In conclusion, our findings provide a possible pathophysiological explanation for the increased anandamide concentration previously shown in active celiac mucosa.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We studied how leukocytapheresis mobilizes bone marrow cells into the peripheral circulation in patients with active UC. Leukocytapheresis transiently reduced peripheral leukocytes, followed by an overshoot increase with emergence of immature leukocytes. The numbers of colonies and CD34(+) cells were comparable between UC patients and normal controls. Shortly after leukocytapheresis, the numbers of both colonies and CD34(+) cells increased significantly in UC patients (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0372, respectively). This was not associated with changes in the concentration of circulating cytokines or epinephrine. These results indicate that leukocytapheresis mobilizes bone marrow cells into the circulation. This cell replacement may partly explain the therapeutic benefit in UC.

PAF can produce several pathological changes in various organs, especially in the colon. In animals PAF causes colonic ulceration and inflammation, which are similar to the anatomic lesions seen in human ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to measure in vivo colonic production of PAF in active ulcerative colitis using a modified colonic perfusion method. Ten patients with active ulcerative colitis and six control patients were investigated. A colonic segment was continuously perfused with a buffer and the liquid was recovered 20 cm distally, after a 45-min period of equilibration, at 20-min intervals. PAF, lysoPAF, and acetylhydrolase were measured in the colonic samples. PAF and lysoPAF outputs were significantly higher in patients with active ulcerative colitis compared to controls patients. There was a significant correlation between colonic PAF output and, respectively, macroscopic mucosal lesions and myeloperoxidase colonic output. We thus conclude: (1) the colonic perfusion method allows in vivo study of the metabolism of PAF during ulcerative colitis and could also be used to study the efficiency of PAF antagonists in UC; and (2) colonic production of PAF is increased during ulcerative colitis and correlated to local injury and inflammation. Whether or not PAF plays a role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis remains open for further investigations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15816997>Indomethacin-induced ileitis is associated with tensiometric, vascular and oxidative changes in the experimental rat model.</a></h2><p>Indomethacin-induced enteritis is a model of .To further characterize this model, rats received two injections of indomethacin (7.5 mg kg(-1)) 24 h apart and histological damage of intestinal mucosa, oxidative stress, alterations of intestinal motility and mesenteric vascular bed (MVB) reactivity were investigated after 5 days.The results show that indomethacin caused several histological and functional changes at the ileal level. In particular, response to carbachol as well as the nonadrenergic-noncholinergic inhibitory response to electrical field stimulation (EFS) was lower in the treated than control rats. Moreover, nitric oxide (NO)-component of the inhibitory response was higher in the treated than control rats. Mesenteric vessels preparations from the treated rats showed increased noradrenaline (NA)-induced perfusion pressure, whereas relaxant responses to acetylcholine, although not significantly reduced in the treated rats, had a higher nitrergic component. This finding suggests that vascular dysfunction may contribute to chronic inflammation. Indomethacin injection also determined acute and severe oxidative stress in ileum mucosa.In conclusion, our study contributes to further characterize the rat model of indomethacin-induced enteritis and suggests that it is suitable for drug screening in rats, as this model can be obtained in a very short period and is simple and reproducible.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18683010>Clinical features and management of postoperative pouch bleeding after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA).</a></h2><p>The clinical features of postoperative bleeding from the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis(IPAA) vary and its management can be difficult. There is no published literature regarding pouch bleeding and its treatment.Pouch bleeding was defined as the passage of blood or clots transanally or into the ileostomy bag with or without hypotension or a drop in hemoglobin within 30 days after surgery. Patients were identified from a prospectively maintained pouch database.Pouch bleeding developed in 47 (1.5%) patients out of 3,194 patients undergoing IPAA since 1983.

These effects were explored in acutely and chronically inflamed colon, using inflammatory bowel disease and appendicitis explants.Caco-2 cells and human colonic explants collected from elective bowel cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or acute appendicitis resections, and were treated with the following drug treatments: vehicle, an inflammatory protocol of interferon γ (IFNγ) and tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα; 10 ng/ml), inflammation and PEA (10 µM), inflammation and CBD (10 µM), and PEA or CBD alone, CBD or vehicle were added simultaneously with IFNγ. Nine intracellular signalling phosphoproteins were determined by multiplex. Inflammatory cytokine secretion was determined using ELISA. Receptor mechanisms were investigated using antagonists for CB, CB, PPARα, PPARγ, TRPV1 and GPR55.IFNγ and TNFα treatment increased phosphoprotein and cytokine levels in Caco-2 cultures and colonic explants. Phosphoprotein levels were significantly reduced by PEA or CBD in Caco-2 cultures and colonic explants. CBD and PEA prevented increases in cytokine production in explant colon, but not in Caco-2 cells. CBD effects were blocked by the CB antagonist AM630 and TRPV1 antagonist SB366791. PEA effects were blocked by the PPARα antagonist GW6471. PEA and CBD were anti-inflammatory in IBD and appendicitis explants.PEA and CBD are anti-inflammatory in the human colon. This effect is not seen in cultured epithelial cells. Appropriately sized clinical trials should assess their efficacy.© 2017 The Author(s).

Diets in omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids appear to have an antiinflammatory effect, which is thought to be due to decreased active prostaglandins and leukotrienes production after incorporation of these fatty acids into cell membrane phospholipids. We investigated the protective effect of fish oil (source of n-3 fatty acids) on hypoxia-induced model of NEC. Young mice were divided into three groups; group 1 mice were fed standard chow (n-3 fatty acids-free), group 2 was fed a chow supplemented by 10% fish oil for 4 weeks. Group 3 mice served as control. We examined the intestinal lesions by light microscopy and measured intestinal tissue PAF and LB4 levels in hypoxia-induced model of NEC. Significantly increased intestinal PAF and LTB4 levels were found in group 1 mice when compared to group 2 and group 3 mice. The histopathology of the intestinal lesions in group 1 animals was characteristic of ischemic injury. In the n-3 fatty acids-supplemented animals these lesions were milder. The present study shows that endogenously released PAF and LTB4 play an important role in mediating hypoxia-induced intestinal necrosis.

The role of oxidative stress as a remarkable upstream part is frequently reported in the signaling cascade of inflammation as well as chemo attractant production. Even though hydrogen peroxide can control cell signaling and stimulate cell proliferation at low levels, in higher concentrations it can initiate apoptosis and in very high levels may create necrosis. So far, the role of ROS in cellular damage and death is well documented with implicating in a broad range of degenerative alterations e.g. carcinogenesis, aging and other oxidative stress related  (OSRDs).

A selected compound UR-12715 (49c) showed an IC(50) of 8 nM in the in vitro PAF-induced aggregation assay, and an ID(50) of 29 microg/kg in the in vivo PAF-induced hypotension test in normotensive rats. Through attachment of 49c to the 5-ASA via azo functionality we obtained UR-12746 (70). Pharmacokinetics experiments with [14C]-70 allow us to reach the following conclusions, critical in the design of these new prodrugs of 5-ASA. Neither the whole molecule 70 nor the carrier 49c were absorbed after oral administration of [14C]-70 in rat as was demonstrated by the absence of plasma levels of radioactivity and the high recovery of it in feces. Effective cleavage of azo bond (84%) by microflora in the colon is achieved. These facts ensure high topical concentrations of 5-ASA and 49c in the colon.

Ten out of the 12 active CD patients were sensitive to all agonists, and 2 active CD patients were sensitive to epinephrine/collagen or epinephrine/ADP. Eight out of the 13 inactive CD patients were sensitive to two or all agonists. Even after remission, almost all of the UC and CD patients showed some increased sensitivity to the agonists. The platelet number and the plasma PDMP levels were significantly higher in the active IBD patients than in the control group.Platelet aggregation responses are enhanced in IBD, even in inactive-phase patients. This increased sensitivity of the platelets may play an important role in the pathophysiology of IBD.</p></html>
