We analyzed effects of body weight (BW) and gestational period on nutrient composition in fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs. Fetuses with the lowest BW (LBW), middle BW (MBW), and highest BW (HBW) were collected at days 45, 75, and 110 of gestation. Crude protein (CP), crude fat, amino acid (AA), and  acid (FA) concentrations were determined. The BW gain, carcass weight, fat percentage, and uterus weight of sows increased as gestation progressed, as did litter weight, average individual fetal weight, fetal body weight, and dry matter (DM). The concentrations of Ala, , crude fat, , Pro, Tyr, C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:1n9c, C18:2n6c, C18:3n3, C18:3n6, C20:0, C20:3n6, saturated FA (SFA), and monounsaturated FA (MUFA) increased significantly as gestation progressed. The percentage of skeleton, and the ratio of the , lung, and stomach to BW decreased as gestation progressed. There were also significant reductions in the concentrations of CP, Asp, Glu, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Phe, Ser, Thr, essential AA (EAA), acidic AA, C17:0, C20:4n6, C22:6n3, unsaturated FA (UFA), polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), n-3PUFA, n-6PUFA as gestation progressed, and reductions in EAA/total AA (TAA), PUFA/SFA, and n-3/n-6 PUFA. The LBW fetuses exhibited the lowest BW and crude fat, C14:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:2n6c, and MUFA concentrations at days 75 and 110 of gestation. They also exhibited lower Tyr concentration at day 45 of gestation and lower Glu concentration at day 75 of gestation than HBW fetuses. These findings suggest that LBW fetuses exhibit lower amounts of crude fat and several FAs during mid-gestation and late-gestation, which may in turn affect adaptability, growth, and development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27143603>Characterization and functional analysis of  acid binding protein from the carcinogenic  fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini.</a></h2><p>In the present study, the cDNA encoding FABP (Ov-FABP) was isolated from the adult stage of Opisthorchis viverrini and characterized. The Ov-FABP protein sequence (107 amino acids) was predicted to have a molecular mass of 12.26kDa and an isoelectric point (PI) of 6.82. This sequence had a high identity and similarity to Cs-FABP of the related opisthorchid Clonorchis sinensis. Multiple sequence alignment with FABPs from other parasitic flatworms and mammals showed a number of conserved amino acids including Phe, , Glu, Glu,Val, Iso, , Ile, Ser and . In addition, the structure of Ov-FABP was predicted to have eleven β-sheets and one α-helix based on the known structures for FABPs from human (hL-FABP), rat and a schistosome. Phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequence data revealed a close relationship of Ov-FABP with Cs-FABP and hL-FABP. Reverse transcription-PCR revealed that Ov-FABP was transcribed in the egg, metacercaria, juvenile and adult stages. The soluble form of recombinant Ov-FABP (rOv-FABP) was shown to specifically bind  acids, including oleic acid, palmitic acid and linoleic acid, as shown for other animals. Anti-serum against rOv-FABP (produced in mice) located the protein to parenchyma, egg, sucker musculature, testes and tegument of adult O. viverrini. Taken together, the findings suggest key functional roles for Ov-FABP in development, reproduction and/or host-parasite interactions.Copyright © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

To date, several studies have revealed that gene mutations of the transporters are likely to be associated with some diseases; however, there are no data concerning the genetic polymorphism of the hOSCP1 gene in Japanese patients with non-viral  carcinoma (LC). In the present study, we isolated genomic DNA from a normal portion of LC, and analyzed 41 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) chosen from a database of SNPs (dbSNPs). We found genotype frequencies for 2 non-synonymous SNPs [rs34409118 (Thr(131) → Ala) and rs1416840 (Ile(219) → Thr)] and 1 synonymous SNP [rs16822954 (Ser(193) → Ser)] to be statistically significant when compared with dbSNPs. No statistical significance was observed in rs2275477 ((307) → ) in the hOSCP1 gene. With respect to the allele frequency, we also observed rs34409118 to be statistically significant. Interestingly, we found that non-viral LC patients do not carry heterozygous mutations in rs1416840 (A/G) and rs16822954 (A/G), suggesting that a non-carrier of heterozygous mutations in these two SNPs might be a biomarker for susceptibility for non-viral LC in Japanese. Further analyses of patients with hOSCP1 variants may elucidate the relationship between the hOSCP1 gene and susceptibility of non-viral LC in Japanese patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076642>Complement C3 activation regulates the production of tRNA-derived fragments -tRFs and promotes alcohol-induced  injury and steatosis.</a></h2><p>Complement is known to play a role in alcoholic   disease (AFLD), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, thereby constraining the development of a rational approach for therapeutic intervention in the complement system. C3 deficiency has been shown to impart protective effects against ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Here we demonstrate a protection effect in wild-type mice by treatment with CR2-Crry, a specific inhibitor of C3 activation. The expression of glycine transfer (t) RNA-derived fragments (-tRFs) is upregulated in ethanol-fed mice and inhibition of -tRFs in vivo decreases chronic ethanol feeding-induced hepatosteatosis without affecting inflammation. The expression of -tRF was downregulated in C3-deficient or CR2-Crry-treated mice, but not in C5-deficient mice; -tRF expression was restored by the C3 activation products C3a or Asp (C3a-des-) via the regulation of CYP2E1. Transcriptome profiling of hepatic tissues showed that -tRF inhibitors upregulate the expression of sirtuin1 (Sirt1) and subsequently affect downstream lipogenesis and β-oxidation pathways. Mechanistically, -tRF interacts with AGO3 to downregulate Sirt1 expression via sequence complementarity in the 3' UTR. Notably, the expression levels of C3d, CYP2E1 and -tRF are upregulated, whereas Sirt1 is decreased in AFLD patients compared to healthy controls. Collectively, our findings suggest that C3 activation products contribute to hepatosteatosis by regulating the expression of -tRF. Complement inhibition at the C3 activation step and treatment with -tRF inhibitors may be potential and precise therapeutic approaches for AFLD.</p></html>
