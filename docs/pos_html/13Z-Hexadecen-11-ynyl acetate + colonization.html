Recent studies have shown that LH has anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, diuretic, and hyperglycemic properties. However, the effects of an ethanol extract of L. herba (ELH), at non-cytotoxic doses, on the metastatic and angiogenic abilities of malignant tumor cells have not been reported. We found that ELH significantly suppressed p38, JNK, and NF-κB activation and proteolytic activities under phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) stimulation, thus leading to a decrease in metastatic potential, including migration and invasion. In addition, ELH suppressed tumor-induced angiogenesis, including migration and tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and microvessel sprouting from aortic rings via decreasing the pro-angiogenic factors in tumors. Interestingly, in ovo xenografts ELH-treated HT1080 cells did not increase in volume and eventually disappeared, owing to a lack of angiogenesis. Daily oral administration of ELH at 50 and 100 mg/kg markedly inhibited metastatic  of B16F10 cells in the lungs of C57BL/6J mice and caused no apparent side effects. These data collectively indicate that ELH is safe and may be useful for managing metastasis and growth of malignant cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293552>Early Intervention With Cecal Fermentation Broth Regulates the  and Development of Gut Microbiota in Broiler Chickens.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of fermentation broth from broiler cecal content on the  and development of the gut microbiota in newly hatched broiler chicks. The fermentation broth was made by a chemostat system using the cecal content from a donor chicken as the source of inoculum. A total of 120 newly hatched broiler chicks were randomly divided into two groups. One group (F group) was orally inoculated with the fermentation broth, and the other (C group) was treated with an equal amount of sterile PBS solution. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to investigate the differences in the cecal microbiota of the broiler chickens between the two groups on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28. Moreover, the concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the cecal contents were analyzed by gas chromatography. The results showed that the abundances of genera  and  decreased sharply in the F group on days 1 and 3 by the early intervention with cecal fermentation broth. In contrast, the relative abundance of the genus  on days 1, 3, and 7, and the family Ruminococcaceae on days 1, 3, and 28 increased in the F group, respectively. In terms of SCFAs, the concentrations of  on day 28, propionic acid on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28, butyrate on day 1, and isovalerate on day 14 were significantly higher in the F group compared with the C group. Overall, these results suggest that early intervention with cecal fermentation broth could have beneficial effects on broilers gut health, which might be attributed to the alterations in the gut microbial composition and the increased concentrations of SCFAs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26282899>Irrigation with N,N-dichloro-2,2-dimethyltaurine (NVC-422) in a citrate buffer maintains urinary catheter patency in vitro and prevents encrustation by Proteus mirabilis.</a></h2><p>Long-term use of indwelling urinary catheters can lead to urinary tract infections and loss of catheter patency due to encrustation and blockage. Encrustation of urinary catheters is due to formation of crystalline biofilms by urease-producing microorganisms such as Proteus mirabilis. An in vitro catheter biofilm model (CBM) was used to evaluate current methods for maintaining urinary catheter patency. We compared antimicrobial-coated urinary Foley catheters, with both available catheter irrigation solutions and investigational solutions containing NVC-422 (N,N-dichloro-2,2-dimethyltaurine; a novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial). Inoculation of the CBM reactor with 10(8) colony-forming units of P. mirabilis resulted in crystalline biofilm formation in catheters by 48 h and blockage of catheters within 5 days. Silver hydrogel or nitrofurazone-coated catheters did not extend the duration of catheter patency. Catheters irrigated daily with commercially available solutions such as 0.25 % acetic acid and isotonic saline blocked at the same rate as untreated catheters. Daily irrigations of catheters with 0.2 % NVC-422 in 10 mM -buffered saline pH 4 or Renacidin maintained catheter patency throughout 10-day studies, but P. mirabilis  of the CBM remained. In contrast, 0.2 % NVC-422 in citrate buffer (6.6 % citric acid at pH 3.8) resulted in an irrigation solution that not only maintained catheter patency for 10 days but also completely eradicated the P. mirabilis biofilm within one treatment day. These data suggest that an irrigation solution containing the rapidly bactericidal antimicrobial NVC-422 in combination with citric acid to permeabilize crystalline biofilm may significantly enhance catheter patency versus other approved irrigation solutions and antimicrobial-coated catheters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30012242>Mast Cells Stimulated with Peptidoglycan from Staphylococcus aureus Augment the Development of Th1 Cells.</a></h2><p>The skin of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) is superficially colonized by Staphylococcus aureus. We have previously found that percutaneous permeation of peptidoglycan (PEG) from S. aureus increases the number of mast cells in the dermis, as seen in skin lesions of AD patients. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the influence of PEG on T helper type 1 (Th1)/ T helper type 2 (Th2) cell development mediated by mast cells.Mast cells were induced by long-term culture of murine spleen cells in medium supplemented with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- a. Ovalbumin (OVA) peptide-pulsed mast cells were incubated with naïve Th cells in the presence or absence of PEG. Five days later, Th cells in the culture were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) and ionomycin, and Th1/Th2 cytokine production was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.It was confirmed that the mast cells we obtained had surface expression of I-Ad, worked as antigen-presenting cells, and induced Th1 cell and Th2 cell development. The stimulation of mast cells with PEG enhanced the development of Th1 cells but not that of Th2 cells. The increase of Th1 cell development stimulated by PEG was associated with an increase in the expression of Notch ligand Delta 1 in the mast cells. Furthermore, treatment of mast cells with the macrolide antibiotic josamycin suppressed Th1 cell development and this was correlated with a reduction of both Delta 1 expression and interleukin (IL)-12 production in mast cells. of S. aureus on the lesioned skin of AD patients contributes to not only an increase in the number of mast cells but also Th1 cell development mediated by mast cells in the dermis and subsequent induction of chronic inflammation, which is characterized by up-regulation of the Th1 cytokine, interferon (IFN)- g. Therefore, application of josamycin to the lesional skin of AD patients may provide relief from chronic inflammation mediated by mast cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28257499>Deacetylation of sialic acid by esterases potentiates pneumococcal neuraminidase activity for mucin utilization,  and virulence.</a></h2><p>Pneumococcal neuraminidase is a key enzyme for sequential deglycosylation of host glycans, and plays an important role in host survival, , and pathogenesis of infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. One of the factors that can affect the activity of neuraminidase is the amount and position of acetylation present in its substrate sialic acid. We hypothesised that pneumococcal esterases potentiate neuraminidase activity by removing acetylation from sialic acid, and that will have a major effect on pneumococcal survival on mucin, , and virulence. These hypotheses were tested using isogenic mutants and recombinant esterases in microbiological, biochemical and in vivo assays. We found that pneumococcal esterase activity is encoded by at least four genes, SPD_0534 (EstA) was found to be responsible for the main esterase activity, and the pneumococcal esterases are specific for short acyl chains. Assay of esterase activity by using natural substrates showed that both the Axe and EstA esterases could use acetylated xylan and Bovine Sub-maxillary Mucin (BSM), a highly acetylated substrate, but only EstA was active against tributyrin (triglyceride). Incubation of BSM with either Axe or EstA led to the  release in a time and concentration dependent manner, and pre-treatment of BSM with either enzyme increased sialic acid release on subsequent exposure to neuraminidase A. qRT-PCR results showed that the expression level of estA and axe increased when exposed to BSM and in respiratory tissues. Mutation of estA alone or in combination with nanA (codes for neuraminidase A), or the replacement of its putative serine active site to alanine, reduced the pneumococcal ability to utilise BSM as a sole carbon source, sialic acid release, , and virulence in a mouse model of pneumococcal pneumonia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31222159>Antibiotic-induced decreases in the levels of microbial-derived short-chain fatty acids correlate with increased gastrointestinal  of Candida albicans.</a></h2><p>Candida albicans is the fourth most common cause of systemic nosocomial infections, posing a significant risk in immunocompromised individuals. As the majority of systemic C. albicans infections stem from endogenous gastrointestinal (GI) , understanding the mechanisms associated with GI  is essential in the development of novel methods to prevent C. albicans-related mortality. In this study, we investigated the role of microbial-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) including , butyrate, and propionate on growth, morphogenesis, and GI  of C. albicans. Our results indicate that cefoperazone-treated mice susceptible to C. albicans infection had significantly decreased levels of SCFAs in the cecal contents that correlate with a higher fungal load in the feces. Further, using in vivo concentration of SCFAs, we demonstrated that SCFAs inhibit the growth, germ tube, hyphae and biofilm development of C. albicans in vitro. Collectively, results from this study suggest that antibiotic-induced decreases in the levels of SCFAs in the cecum enhances the growth and GI  of C. albicans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29566905>Lifestyle alters GUT-bacteria function: Linking immune response and host.</a></h2><p>Microbiota in human is a "mixture society" of different species (i.e. bacteria, viruses, funguses) populations with a different way of relationship classification to Human. Human GUT serves as the host of the majority of different bacterial populations (GUT flora, more than 500 species), which are with us ("from the beginning") in an innate manner known as the commensal (no harm to each other) and symbiotic (mutual benefit) relationship. A homeostatic balance of host-bacteria relationship is very important and vital for a normal health process. However, this beneficial relationship and delicate homeostatic state can be disrupted by the imbalance of microbiome-composition of gut microbiota, expressing a pathogenic state. A strict homeostatic balance of microbiome-composition strongly depends on several factors; 1- lifestyle, 2- geography, 3- ethnicities, 4- "mom" as prime of the type of bacterial  in infant and 5- the disease. With such diversity in individuals combined with huge number of different bacterial species and their interactions, it is wise to perform an in-depth systems biology (e.g. genomics, proteomics, glycomics, and etcetera) analysis of personalized microbiome. Only in this way, we are able to generate a map of complete GUT microbiota and, in turn, to determine its interaction with host and intra-interaction with pathogenic bacteria. A specific microbiome analysis provides us the knowledge to decipher the nature of interactions between the GUT microbiota and the host and its response to the invading bacteria in a pathogenic state. The GUT-bacteria composition is independent of geography and ethnicity but lifestyle well affects GUT-bacteria composition and function. Microbiome knowledge obtained by systems biology also helps us to change the behavior of GUT microbiota in response to the pathogenic microbes as protection. Functional microbiome changes in response to environmental factors will be discussed in this review.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In recent studies, extract of raw or stir-baked GF was shown to have pharmacological activities for viral infection, thrombosis, hyperlipidemia, convulsion, inflammation, oxidative stress, and others. In addition, baked GF extract suppressed the proteolytic activities and altered the cellular morphology of tumor cells. However, the effects of ethanol extract of baked GF (EBGF) on the metastatic and angiogenic capacities of malignant tumor cells and its detailed mechanism of action have not been reported. In this study, we found that EBGF significantly inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA)-induced MMP-9 and -13 and uPA expression via suppression of PMA-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κBp65. Metastatic potential, including migration, invasion, and , was substantially reduced by EBGF with no cytotoxicity. In addition, EBGF attenuated tumor-induced angiogenesis, including microvessel sprouting, migration of endothelial cells (ECs), and tube formation of ECs, by inhibiting the release of pro-angiogenic factors from tumor cells. In C57BL/6 mice, we observed that daily administration of EBGF at 50 and 100 mg/kg suppressed metastatic  of B16F10 melanoma cells in the lungs. Furthermore, EBGF administration did not cause adverse effects, suggesting that EBGF is safe and may be a potential herbal medicine capable of controlling metastatic malignant cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31231319>The Not-so-Sterile Womb: Evidence That the Human Fetus Is Exposed to Bacteria Prior to Birth.</a></h2><p>The human microbiome includes trillions of bacteria, many of which play a vital role in host physiology. Numerous studies have now detected bacterial DNA in first-pass meconium and amniotic fluid samples, suggesting that the human microbiome may commence . However, these data have remained contentious due to underlying contamination issues. Here, we have used a previously described method for reducing contamination in microbiome workflows to determine if there is a fetal bacterial microbiome beyond the level of background contamination. We recruited 50 women undergoing non-emergency cesarean section deliveries with no evidence of intra-uterine infection and collected first-pass meconium and amniotic fluid samples. Full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed using PacBio SMRT cell technology, to allow high resolution profiling of the fetal gut and amniotic fluid bacterial microbiomes. Levels of inflammatory cytokines were measured in amniotic fluid, and levels of immunomodulatory short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were quantified in meconium. All meconium samples and most amniotic fluid samples (36/43) contained bacterial DNA. The meconium microbiome was dominated by reads that mapped to . Aside from this species, the meconium microbiome was remarkably heterogeneous between patients. The amniotic fluid microbiome was more diverse and contained mainly reads that mapped to typical skin commensals, including  and  spp. All meconium samples contained  and propionate, at ratios similar to those previously reported in infants.  reads were inversely correlated with meconium propionate levels. Amniotic fluid cytokine levels were associated with the amniotic fluid microbiome. Our results demonstrate that bacterial DNA and SCFAs are present , and have the potential to influence the developing fetal immune system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29874632>Microbial anodic consortia fed with fermentable substrates in microbial electrolysis cells: Significance of microbial structures.</a></h2><p>Microbial community structure of anodic biofilms plays a key role in bioelectrochemical systems (BESs). When ecosystems are used as inocula, many bacterial species having interconnected ecological interactions are present. The aim of the present study was to identify these interactions for the conversion of single substrates into electrical current. Dual-chamber reactors were inoculated with activated sludge and fed in batch mode with , lactate, butyrate and propionate at 80 mMe equivalents in quadruplicate. Analyses of biofilms and planktonic microbial communities showed that the anodic biofilms were mainly dominated by the Geobacter genus (62.4% of the total sequences). At the species level, Geobacter sulfurreducens was dominant in presence of lactate and , while Geobacter toluenoxydans and Geobacter pelophilus were dominant with butyrate and propionate as substrates. These results indicate for the first time a specificity within the Geobacter genus towards the electron donor, suggesting a competitive process for electrode  and the implementations of syntrophic interactions for complete oxidation of substrates such as propionate and butyrate. All together, these results provide a new insight into the ecological relationships within electroactive biofilms and suggest eco-engineering perspectives to improve the performances of BESs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Bifidobacteria are the major bacterial group in the feces of vaginally delivered and breast milk-fed infants. Among the bifidobacteria, only Bifidobacterium bifidum is able to degrade mucin and to release monosaccharides which can be used by other gut microbes colonizing the infant gut. Eubacterium hallii is an early occurring commensal that produces butyrate and propionate from fermentation metabolites but that cannot degrade complex oligo- and polysaccharides. We aimed to demonstrate that mucin cross-feeding initiated by B. bifidum enables growth and metabolite formation of E. hallii leading to short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) formation. Growth and metabolite formation of co-cultures of B. bifidum, of Bifidobacterium breve or Bifidobacterium infantis, which use mucin-derived hexoses and fucose, and of E. hallii were determined. Growth of E. hallii in the presence of lactose and mucin monosaccharides was tested. In co-culture fermentations, the presence of B. bifidum enabled growth of the other strains. B. bifidum/B. infantis co-cultures yielded , formate, and lactate while co-cultures of B. bifidum and E. hallii formed , formate, and butyrate. In three-strain co-cultures, B. bifidum, E. hallii, and B. breve or B. infantis produced up to 16 mM , 5 mM formate, and 4 mM butyrate. The formation of propionate (approximately 1 mM) indicated cross-feeding on fucose. Lactose, galactose, and GlcNAc were identified as substrates of E. hallii. This study shows that trophic interactions of bifidobacteria and E. hallii lead to the formation of , butyrate, propionate, and formate, potentially contributing to intestinal SCFA formation with potential benefits for the host and for microbial  of the infant gut. The ratios of SCFA formed differed depending on the microbial species involved in mucin cross-feeding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28214969>Attached and Suspended Denitrifier Communities in Pristine Limestone Aquifers Harbor High Fractions of Potential Autotrophs Oxidizing Reduced Iron and Sulfur Compounds.</a></h2><p>Oxygen and nitrate availability as well as the presence of suitable organic or inorganic electron donors are strong drivers of denitrification; however, the factors influencing denitrifier abundance and community composition in pristine aquifers are not well understood. We explored the denitrifier community structure of suspended and attached groundwater microorganisms in two superimposed limestone aquifer assemblages with contrasting oxygen regime in the Hainich Critical Zone Exploratory (Germany). Attached communities were retrieved from freshly crushed parent rock material which had been exposed for  in two groundwater wells (12.7 and 48 m depth). Quantitative PCR and amplicon pyrosequencing of nirK and nirS genes encoding copper-containing or cytochrome cd1 heme-type nitrite reductase, respectively, and of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes showed a numerical predominance of nirS-type denitrifiers in both attached and suspended groundwater communities and a dominance of nirS-type denitrifiers closely related to the autotrophic thiosulfate- and hydrogen-oxidizing Sulfuritalea hydrogenivorans and the iron- and sulfide-oxidizing Sideroxydans lithotrophicus ES-1. Potential rates of nitrate reduction in association with exposed crushed rock material were higher with an inorganic electron donor (thiosulfate) compared to an organic electron donor (fumarate/) in the upper aquifer assemblage but similar in the lower, oxic aquifer. Our results have clearly demonstrated that groundwater from pristine limestone aquifers harbors diverse denitrifier communities which appear to selectively attach to rock surfaces and harbor a high potential for nitrate reduction. Our findings suggest that the availability of suitable inorganic versus organic electron donors rather than oxygen availability shapes denitrifier communities and their potential activity in these limestone aquifers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27757749>Effects of alkaloid extracts of mesquite pod on the products of in vitro rumen fermentation.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of alkaloid extracts of Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) D.C. pods obtained by two extraction methods as compared with sodium monensin on the gas production kinetic, mitigation of methane, and rumen fermentation products using wheat bran or Tifton 85 hay as substrates, by the semi-automatic in vitro gas production technique. A completely randomized design was adopted, and two natural additives were tested made from mesquite pod (alkaloid extract I and alkaloid extract II) at three levels (3.9, 7.9, and 12 μg), sodium monensin 5 μM (positive control), and no inclusion of additives (negative control). The volume of gases produced by the degradation of the fibrous fraction of wheat bran was influenced by the concentration of the extract I added to the medium, and the amounts of 7.9 and 12 μg were equal to monensin at the lowest value. The degradation rate of the fibrous carbohydrates with additive extract I at 12 μg was lower in relation to monensin. When Tifton 85 hay was utilized, alkaloid extract I provided a shorter  time as compared with monensin at the added amounts of 7.9 and 12 μg and higher production of gases from the fibrous fraction but without interfering with the total volume of gases produced during 96 h of fermentation of carbohydrates. In the periods of 12 and 24 h of incubation, utilizing alkaloid extract I, the mean values of methane production with wheat bran and Tifton 85 hay were lower than monensin (p < 0.05) when the respective amounts of 7.9 and 12 μg were added.

The gut microbiome in established allergic disease and prior to disease onset has also been assessed in clinical trials. One study demonstrated a strong association between high abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and decreased levels of butyrate and propionate, and established eczema. Lower relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae appears to be implicated in food sensitization and to precede the development of atopic eczema. Decreased relative abundance of Lachnospira, Veillonella, Faecalibacterium, and Rothia in early infancy was reported to be associated with increased asthma risk. Inoculation of germ-free mice with these genera decreased airway inflammation in their offspring thereby proposing a causal role of bacteria in preventing allergic airways disease.Gut microbiome research is an actively developing field. Although candidate bacterial taxa have been reported it still remains unclear which bacteria (or other microbes), in which numbers and combinations, and when during the gut  process may prevent allergic diseases and asthma.

Further nano-rough surfaces (Ra 4.5nm) were patterned with arrays of micro-pillars 500μm high. All these electrodes were implemented in pure cultures of Geobacter sulfurreducens, under a constant potential of 0.1V/SCE and with a single addition of  10mM to check the early formation of microbial anodes. The flat smooth electrodes produced an average current density of 0.9A·m. The flat nano-rough electrodes reached 2.5A·m on average, but with a large experimental deviation of ±2.0A·m. This large deviation was due to the erratic  of the surface but, when settled on the surface, the cells displayed current density that was directly correlated to the biofilm coverage ratio. The micro-pillars considerably improved the experimental reproducibility by offering the cells a quieter environment, facilitating biofilm development. Current densities of up to 8.5A·m (per projected surface area) were thus reached, in spite of rate limitation due to the mass transport of the buffering species, as demonstrated by numerical modelling. Nano-roughness combined with micro-structuring increased current density by a factor close to 10 with respect to the smooth flat surface.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

As chemical signaling is a significant component in plant-insect interaction, the present study examined the involvement of rosemary essential oil volatiles in this differential  to elucidate the rosemary-whitefly ecological interaction. Thirty-two rosemary varieties with different chemical profiles were used. The average whitefly preference was 25.1% with a significant variation of 51.4%, partitioning the sampled varieties into five preference groups, hence suggesting rosemary as a non-preferred host for the insect. All relations between preference and the major volatiles 1,8-cineole, camphor, linalool, verbenone, bornyl  and borneol were significantly (P ≤ 0.05) or notably (0.05 < P ≤ 0.09) negative (r < 1). Therefore, revealing that whitefly preference for rosemary is based on a continuum of repellency rather than attraction. 'Choice' bioassays with a range of the major volatile concentrations and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) volatile blends (fractions) validated this observation. Principle component analysis of the entire chemical profile of two extreme varieties, representing high and low preferences, identified that approximately 43% of the volatiles in the essential oil were directly associated with repellency. Keeping in mind the remaining 57% of the compounds, this myriad of volatiles exhibit the ecological complexity of the rosemary-whitefly eco-system, explaining that whitefly preference to rosemary is repellency based.© The Author(s) 2018.

Previous studies have shown that the survival of the  pandemic El Tor biotype  strain N16961 requires production of acetoin in a glucose-rich environment. The production of acetoin, a neutral fermentation end-product, allows  to metabolize glucose without a pH drop, which is mediated by the production of organic acid. This finding suggests that inhibition of acetoin fermentation can result in  elimination by causing a pH imbalance under glucose-rich conditions. Here, we developed a simple high-throughput screening method and identified an inducer of medium acidification (iMAC). Of 8364 compounds screened, we identified one chemical, 5-(4-chloro-2-nitrobenzoyl)-6-hydroxy-1,3-dimethylpyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione, that successfully killed glucose-metabolizing N16961 by inducing acidic stress. When N16961 was grown with abundant glucose in the presence of iMAC, acetoin production was completely suppressed and concomitant accumulation of lactate and  was observed. Using a beta-galactosidase activity assay with a single-copy p reporter fusion, we show that that iMAC likely inhibits acetoin production at the transcriptional level. Thin-layer chromatography revealed that iMAC causes a significantly reduced accumulation of intracellular (p)ppGpp, a bacterial stringent response alarmone known to positively regulate acetoin production.  bacterial  and fluid accumulation were also markedly decreased after iMAC treatment.

However, metabolic enzymes and pathways of uncultured microorganisms and their ecological interactions with methanogenic consortia are unknown because of their resistance to isolation and limited genomic information.Genome-resolved metagenomics approaches were used to reconstruct and dissect 23 prokaryotic genomes from 37 and 20 °C methanogenic phenol-degrading reactors. Comparative genomic evidence suggests that temperature difference leads to the  of two distinct cooperative sub-communities that can respire sulfate/sulfite/sulfur or nitrate/nitrite compounds and compete for uptake of methanogenic substrates (e.g.,  and hydrogen). This competition may differentiate methanogenesis. The uncultured - G1, whose close relatives have broad ecological niches including the deep-sea vents, aquifers, sediment, limestone caves, spring, and anaerobic digesters, is implicated as a -like facultative anaerobic diazotroph with metabolic versatility and remarkable environmental adaptability. We provide first genomic evidence for butyrate, alcohol, and carbohydrate utilization by a  T78 clade bacterium, and phenol carboxylation and assimilatory sulfite reduction in a  bacterium.Genome-resolved metagenomics enriches our view on the differentiation of microbial community composition, metabolic pathways, and ecological interactions in temperature-differentiated methanogenic phenol-degrading bioreactors. These findings suggest optimization strategies for methanogenesis on phenol, such as temperature control, protection from light, feed desulfurization, and hydrogen sulfide removal from bioreactors. Moreover, decoding genome-borne properties (e.g., antibiotic, arsenic, and heavy metal resistance) of uncultured bacteria help to bring up alternative schemes to isolate them.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29541936>Fungal endophytes of turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) and their biocontrol potential against pathogens Pythium aphanidermatum and Rhizoctonia solani.</a></h2><p>Endophytic fungi have been isolated from the healthy turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) rhizomes from South India. Thirty-one endophytes were identified based on morphological and ITS-rDNA sequence analysis. The isolated endophytes were screened for antagonistic activity against Pythium aphanidermatum (Edson) Fitzp., and Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn., causing rhizome rot and leaf blight diseases in turmeric respectively. Results revealed that only six endophytes showed > 70% suppression of test pathogens in antagonistic dual culture assays. The endophyte T. harzianum TharDOB-31 showed significant in vitro mycelial growth inhibition of P. aphanidermatum (76.0%) and R. solani (76.9%) when tested by dual culture method. The SEM studies of interaction zone showed morphological abnormalities like parasitism, shriveling, breakage and lysis of hyphae of the pathogens by endophyte TharDOB-31. Selected endophytic isolates recorded multiple plant growth promoting traits in in vitro studies. The rhizome bacterization followed by soil application of endophyte TharDOB-31 showed lowest Percent Disease Incidence of rhizome rot and leaf blight, 13.8 and 11.6% respectively. The treatment of TharDOB-31 exhibited significant increase in plant height (85 cm) and fresh rhizome yield/plant (425 g) in comparison with untreated control under greenhouse condition. The confocal microscopy validates the  of the TharDOB-31 in turmeric rhizomes. The secondary metabolites in ethyl  extract of TharDOB-31 were found to contain higher number of antifungal compounds by high resolution liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer analysis. Thereby, endophyte T. harzianum isolate can be exploited as a potential biocontrol agent for suppressing rhizome rot and leaf blight diseases in turmeric.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27324468>Treatment with rhDNase in patients with cystic fibrosis alters in-vitro CHIT-1 activity of isolated leucocytes.</a></h2><p>Recent data suggest a possible relationship between cystic fibrosis (CF) pharmacotherapy, Aspergillus fumigatus  (AC) and/or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). The aim of this study was to determine if anti-fungal defence mechanisms are influenced by CF pharmacotherapy, i.e. if (1) neutrophils form CF and non-CF donors differ in their ability to produce chitotriosidase (CHIT-1); (2) if incubation of isolated neutrophils with azithromycin, salbutamol, prednisolone or rhDNase might influence the CHIT-1 activity; and (3) if NETosis and neutrophil killing efficiency is influenced by rhDNase. Neutrophils were isolated from the blood of CF patients (n = 19; mean age 26·8 years or healthy, non-CF donors (n = 20; 38·7 years) and stimulated with phorbol-12-myristate-13- (PMA), azithromycin, salbutamol, prednisolone or rhDNase. CHIT-1 enzyme activity was measured with a fluorescent substrate. NETosis was induced by PMA and neutrophil killing efficiency was assessed by a hyphae recovery assay. Neutrophil CHIT-1 activity was comparable in the presence or absence of PMA stimulation in both CF and non-CF donors. PMA stimulation and preincubation with rhDNase increased CHIT-1 activity in culture supernatants from non-CF and CF donors. However, this increase was significant in non-CF donors but not in CF patients (P < 0·05). RhDNase reduced the number of NETs in PMA-stimulated neutrophils and decreased the killing efficiency of leucocytes in our in-vitro model. Azithromycin, salbutamol or prednisolone had no effect on CHIT-1 activity. Stimulation of isolated leucocytes with PMA and treatment with rhDNase interfered with anti-fungal defence mechanisms. However, the impact of our findings for treatment in CF patients needs to be proved in a clinical cohort.© 2016 British Society for Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30911221>The Synergistic Role of Diet and Exercise in the Prevention, Pathogenesis, and Management of Ulcerative Colitis: An Underlying Metabolic Mechanism.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a biologically complex condition characterized by chronic, relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. The relative incidence of this debilitating condition is increasing and sociologically damaging outcomes are a continued reality. Several etiological theories for UC are currently under investigation, spanning between genetic and environmental determinants. From an environmental perspective, previous literature reviews have demonstrated the independent effectiveness of specific diet and exercise patterns in modifying UC immuno-pathophysiology. This article explores the  role of diet and aerobic exercise in the prevention, pathogenesis, and management of UC in the context of recent immunological research. Through a unifying mechanism-that is, microbial influence of colonic inflammation and immuno-pathophysiology-the simultaneous reduction of pro-inflammatory dietary sulfurous amino acid intake (ie methionine, cysteine, homocysteine, and taurine) and the upregulation of aerobic exercise frequency (which spurs the  of anti-inflammatory butyrate, , and propionate producing microbial taxa) demonstrate the clinical efficacy of incorporating both diet and exercise modifications for UC prevention and management through pathogenic alterations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26572402>Formulation and in vivo evaluation of probiotics-encapsulated pellets with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose  succinate (HPMCAS).</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to formulate probiotics-encapsulated pellets with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose  succinate (HPMCAS) using a dry powder coating technique to improve the storage stability, acid resistance, and intestinal adherence of viable bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacteria animalis ssp. Lactis). Dry coated pellet (DCP) loaded with probiotics was optimized with respect to the quantity of the HPMCAS, an enteric coating polymer (108 mg), and the kinds and amounts of plasticizer (triethyl citrate, 15.7 mg; acetylated monoglyceride, 6.8 mg), by evaluating the survival rate of the bacteria during preparation process and in an acidic medium. Dry coating process allows the whole survivals of living bacteria during preparation process. The DCP formulation exhibited markedly higher acid tolerability and storage stability compared to uncoated viable bacteria. In an in vivo mucosal adherence study in rats, a profound  of viable bacteria in the small and large intestine was observed in rats receiving DCP system (p<0.05) compared to rats receiving uncoated probiotics. Moreover, we found that the repeated DCP administration noticeably inhibited intestinal penetration of endotoxin, a potent inflammatory stimulant, from intestinal mucus. The novel DCP system may be an alternative approach for improving bacterial viability in the preparation process and in an acidic medium, and to promote mucosal  of probiotic bacteria in the human gut.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we characterized the Streptomyces spp. for their  ability, plant growth promotion and protection against fungal disease in three cereals. In vitro analysis by dual culture study showed inhibitory effect on the rice pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae B157 along with inhibition of the ubiquitous phytopathogen Rhizoctonia solani by the Streptomyces spp. used in this study. The active compounds responsible for phytopathogen inhibition were extracted with ethyl  and tested positive against the fungal pathogens. GC-MS based identification of the active compounds responsible for fungal pathogen inhibition showed them to be 2-(chloromethyl)-2-cyclopropyloxirane, 2, 4- ditert-butylphenol and 1-ethylthio-3-methyl-1, 3-butadiene in extracts of culture supernatants from the three different strains respectively. EGFP tagged Streptomyces strains showed profuse  in roots as well as aerial parts of cereal plants. Direct inhibitory action against M. oryzae B157 and R. solani correlated with the observation that upon fungal pathogen challenge, the bacterized rice, sorghum and wheat plants showed significantly good plant growth, particularly in aerial parts as compared to unbacterized controls. In addition, benefit was seen in inoculated healthy plants in terms of increase in wet weight of roots and shoots as compared to the uninoculated controls. The mechanism of biocontrol also involved induction of plant defense response as evidenced by the upregulation of PR10a, NPR1, PAL and LOX2 in Streptomyces colonized plants.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

Here, we investigated the effect of dietary fibres on the abundance, composition, and activity of butyrate-producing bacteria in suckling piglets. Piglets were fed a control diet or creep feeds containing alfalfa, wheat bran, or pure cellulose, respectively, from postnatal day 7 to 22. Large intestinal digesta and mucosa samples were collected for quantitative analysis of bacterial group-specific 16S ribosomal RNA- and butyrate production-related genes, and digesta samples for quantification of short-chain fatty acids. The alfalfa diet increased (P < 0.05) Clostridium cluster XIVa abundance, copies of genes encoding proteins involved in butyrate production (butyryl-CoA: CoA-transferase, butyrate kinase), and butyrate concentration compared to the wheat bran diet in the digesta of the proximal colon. In the distal colonic digesta, animals fed the alfalfa diet had the highest number of butyryl-CoA: CoA-transferase gene copies (P < 0.05) and numerically the highest butyrate concentration, albeit not significant (P > 0.05), compared to other groups. In the distal colonic mucosa, the cellulose diet increased (P < 0.05) the abundance of Clostridium cluster XIVa and copies of the butyryl-CoA: CoA-transferase gene compared to the alfalfa diet. These results indicated that dietary fibres modulate the abundance and activity of butyrate-producing bacteria in the large intestine of suckling piglets, and that a moderate supplementation of alfalfa and cellulose may benefit early-life gut health through the delivery of butyrate to the mucosa.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25642214>Activity of the response regulator CiaR in mutants of Streptococcus pneumoniae R6 altered in acetyl phosphate production.</a></h2><p>The two-component regulatory system (TCS) CiaRH of Streptococcus pneumoniae is implicated in competence, ß-lactam resistance, maintenance of cell integrity, bacteriocin production, host , and virulence. Depending on the growth conditions, CiaR can be highly active in the absence of its cognate kinase CiaH, although phosphorylation of CiaR is required for DNA binding and gene regulation. To test the possibility that acetyl phosphate (AcP) could be the alternative phosphodonor, genes involved in pyruvate metabolism were disrupted to alter cellular levels of acetyl phosphate. Inactivating the genes of pyruvate oxidase SpxB, phosphotransacetylase Pta, and  kinase AckA, resulted in very low AcP levels and in strongly reduced CiaR-mediated gene expression in CiaH-deficient strains. Therefore, alternative phosphorylation of CiaR appears to proceed via AcP. The AcP effect on CiaR is not detected in strains with CiaH. Attempts to obtain elevated AcP by preventing its degradation by  kinase AckA, were not successful in CiaH-deficient strains with a functional SpxB, the most important enzyme for AcP production in S. pneumoniae. The ciaH-spxB-ackA mutant producing intermediate amounts of AcP could be constructed and showed a promoter activation, which was much higher than expected. Since activation was dependent on AcP, it can apparently be used more efficiently for CiaR phosphorylation in the absence of AckA. Therefore, high AcP levels in the absence of CiaH and AckA may cause extreme overexpression of the CiaR regulon leading to synthetic lethality. AckA is also involved in a regulatory response, which is mediated by CiaH. Addition of  to the growth medium switch CiaH from kinase to phosphatase. This switch is lost in the absence of AckA indicating metabolism of  is required, which starts with the production of AcP by AckA. Therefore, AckA plays a special regulatory role in the control of the CiaRH TCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29472900>Spatial Heterogeneity and Co-occurrence of Mucosal and Luminal Microbiome across Swine Intestinal Tract.</a></h2><p>Pigs are one of the most important economic livestock. Gut microbiota is not only critical to the health but also the production efficiency of pigs. Manipulating gut microbiota relies on the full view of gut microbiome and the understanding of drive forces shaping microbial communities. 16s rDNA sequencing was used to profile microbiota along the longitudinal and radical axes to obtain the topographical map of microbiome in different intestinal compartments in young pigs. Alpha and beta-diversities revealed distinct differences in microbial compositions between the distal ileum and cecum and colon, as well as between the lumen and mucosa.  and  dominated in the ileum, constituting 95 and 80% of the luminal and mucosa-attached microbiome. Transitioning from the small intestine to the large intestine, luminal  increased from 1.69 to 45.98% in the cecum and 40.09% in the colon, while mucosal  raised from 9 to 35.36% and 27.96%. Concurrently, luminal  and  and mucosal-attached  remarkably decreased.

Strong co-exclusion was shown between  with -centered microbial groups in the lumen. Redundancy analysis found bile acids and short chain fatty acids explained 37.1 and 41% of variations in the luminal microbial composition, respectively. Primary bile acid, taurine- and glycine- conjugated bile acids were positively correlated with , whereas secondary bile acids, , propionate, butyrate, and valerate were positively correlated with . Functional analyses demonstrated that , and  were positively correlated with gene functions related to amino acids, energy, cofactors and vitamins metabolism, which are indispensable for the hosts.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), a highly effective treatment method for recurrent CDI, has been demonstrated to induce microbiota recovery. One of the proposed functions associated with restoration of  resistance against C. difficile has been recovery of bile acid metabolism. In this study, we aimed to assess recovery of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in addition to bile acids alongside microbial community structure in six patients with recurrent CDI following treatment with FMT over time. Using 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing, we observed marked similarity of the microbiota between recipients following FMT (n = 6, sampling up to 6 months post-FMT) and their respective donors. Sustained increases in the levels of the SCFAs butyrate, , and propionate were observed post-FMT, and variable recovery over time was observed in the secondary bile acids deoxycholate and lithocholate. To correlate these changes with specific microbial taxa at an individual level, we applied a generalized estimating equation approach to model metabolite concentrations with the presence of specific members of the microbiota. Metabolites that increased following FMT were associated with bacteria classified within the Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and unclassified Clostridiales families. In contrast, members of these taxa were inversely associated with primary bile acids. The longitudinal aspect of this study allowed us to characterize individualized patterns of recovery, revealing variability between and within patients following FMT.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

These compounds not only protect the host from pathogen  but also modulate the activity of mucosal immune cells, thereby playing an important role in inflammatory host responses. In this study, we demonstrated that exposure of anti-CD3/CD28 or phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA)/ionomycin-activated HuT-78 T lymphocyte cells to 10-20 mM d-lactate significantly increased IL-4 and IL-13 production. Interestingly, the d-lactate isomer, exclusively produced locally by gut or cervicovaginal microbiota, was found to be more potent than the l-isomer. Interestingly, neither of the strong histone deacetylase inhibitors [structurally similar butyrate and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA)] was as effective in the stimulation of IL-13 production as d-lactate. Lactate transport through monocarboxylate transporters was required for lactate-enhanced IL-13 production in a manner that was not hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1-dependent. Furthermore, lactate treatment increased the acetylation of GATA-3, a critical regulator of Th1/Th2 differentiation and resulted in H3 and H4 histone hyperacetylation state, which is a characteristic feature of transcriptionally active chromatin. Both lactate isomers also enhanced IL4 and IL13 promoter-driven activity of reporter constructs in murine and human cells.

Ethanol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH), catalase or cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) to acetaldehyde, which is then further oxidized to  by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Acetaldehyde has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a Group 1 carcinogen to humans. The acetaldehyde level in the stomach and colon is locally influenced by gastric  by  or colonic microbes, as well as polymorphisms in the genes encoding tissue alcohol metabolizing enzymes, especially ALDH2. Alcohol stimulates the uptake of carcinogens and their metabolism and also changes the composition of enteric microbes in a way to enhance the aldehyde level. Alcohol also undergoes chemical coupling to membrane phospholipids and disrupts organization of tight junctions, leading to nuclear translocation of β-catenin and ZONAB, which may contributes to regulation of genes involved in proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Alcohol also generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) by suppressing the expression of antioxidant and cytoprotective enzymes and inducing expression of CYP2E1 which contribute to the metabolic activation of chemical carcinogens. Besides exerting genotoxic effects by directly damaging DNA, ROS can activates signaling molecules involved in inflammation, metastasis and angiogenesis. In addition, alcohol consumption induces folate deficiency, which may result in aberrant DNA methylation profiles, thereby influencing cancer-related gene expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28611501>Influence of Diet Composition on Cattle Rumen Methanogenesis: A Comparative Metagenomic Analysis in Indian and Exotic Cattle.</a></h2><p>Comparative metagenomics approach has been used in this study to discriminate  of methanogenic population in different breeds of cattle.

The abundance of genes for methanogenesis in Holstein and Jersey cattle came from  order whereas, majority of the enzymes for methanogenesis in Gir and Kankrej cattle came from  order.

We investigated the distribution and function of candidate SCFA transporters in rat duodenum. The Na(+)-coupled monocarboxylate transporter-1 (SMCT1) was localized to the brush border, whereas the pH-dependent monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 1 and MCT4 were localized to the duodenocyte basolateral membrane. In Ussing chambered duodenal mucosa, luminal  dose-dependently increased short-circuit current (Isc) in the presence of serosal bumetanide and indomethacin by a luminal Na(+)-dependent, ouabain-sensitive mechanism. The Isc response was inhibited dose-dependently by the SMCT1 nonsubstrate inhibitor ibuprofen, consistent with net electrogenic absorption of  via SMCT1. Other SCFAs and lactate also increased Isc. Furthermore, duodenal loop perfusion of  increased portal venous  concentration, inhibited by coperfusion of ibuprofen or a MCT inhibitor. Luminal  perfusion increased duodenal HCO3 (-) secretion via capsaicin-sensitive afferent nerve activation and cyclooxygenase activity, consistent with absorption-mediated HCO3 (-) secretion. These results suggest that absorption of luminal SCFA via SMCT1 and MCTs increases duodenal HCO3 (-) secretion. In addition to SCFA sensing via free fatty acid receptors, the presence of rapid duodenal SCFA absorption may be important for the suppression of luminal bacterial  and implicated in the generation of functional dyspepsia due to bacterial overgrowth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28070562>Biological and Chemical Adaptation to Endogenous Hydrogen Peroxide Production in  D39.</a></h2><p>The catalase-negative, facultative anaerobe  D39 is naturally resistant to hydrogen peroxide (HO) produced endogenously by pyruvate oxidase (SpxB). Here, we investigate the adaptive response to endogenously produced HO. We show that lactate oxidase, which converts lactate to pyruvate, positively impacts pyruvate flux through SpxB and that  mutants produce significantly lower HO. In addition, both the SpxB pathway and a candidate pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) pathway contribute to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) production during aerobic growth, and the pyruvate format lyase (PFL) pathway is the major acetyl-CoA pathway during anaerobic growth. Microarray analysis of the D39 strain cultured under aerobic versus strict anaerobic conditions shows upregulation of , a gene encoding a rhodanese-like protein (locus tag ), , , , , and an Fe-S protein biogenesis operon under HO-producing conditions. Proteome profiling of HO-induced sulfenylation reveals that sulfenylation levels correlate with cellular HO production, with endogenous sulfenylation of ≈50 proteins. Deletion  increases cellular sulfenylation 5-fold and has an inhibitory effect on ATP generation. Two major targets of protein sulfenylation are glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GapA) and SpxB itself, but targets also include pyruvate kinase, LctO, AdhE, and  kinase (AckA). Sulfenylation of GapA is inhibitory, while the effect on SpxB activity is negligible. Strikingly, four enzymes of capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis are sulfenylated, as are enzymes associated with nucleotide biosynthesis via ribulose-5-phosphate. We propose that LctO/SpxB-generated HO functions as a signaling molecule to downregulate capsule production and drive altered flux through sugar utilization pathways.  Adaptation to endogenous oxidative stress is an integral aspect of   and virulence. In this work, we identify key transcriptomic and proteomic features of the pneumococcal endogenous oxidative stress response.

Based on the  frequency, the dominant genera were found to be Colletotrichum, Alternaria and Chaetomium with  frequency % of 8.66, 7.00 and 6.33, respectively. It was observed that the species diversity and richness was the highest in bark followed by leaf and stem regions of the plant. On screening the fungal ethyl  extracts for cytotoxicity against the HeLa cells, the Chaetomium nigricolor extract exhibited potent cytotoxic activity of 92.20% at 100 μg mL concentration. Comparison between the different organic extracts (ethyl , chloroform, dichloromethane and hexane) of Chaetomium nigricolor mycelial and culture filtrate, it was observed that the mycelial as well the culture filtrate ethyl  extracts and the culture filtrate hexane extract showed significant cytotoxic potential against the HeLa and MCF-7 cells, respectively. The apoptotic- and mitochondrial membrane depolarisation-induction potential of the Chaetomium nigricolor ethyl  extract has also been demonstrated in this study. Further the screening of antioxidant potential of the ethyl  fungal extracts using DPPH scavenging assay showed that Chaetomium nigricolor extract exhibited potential activity with a significant EC value of 22 μg mL. The ethyl  extract of Chaetomium nigricolor also exhibited superoxide radical scavenging potential.These results indicated that diverse endophytic fungal population inhabits Catharanthus roseus. One of the fungal isolate Chaetomium nigricolor exhibited significant cytotoxic, apoptotic and antioxidant potential.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30521551>Gut microbiota signatures in cystic fibrosis: Loss of host CFTR function drives the microbiota enterophenotype.</a></h2><p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disorder affecting the respiratory, digestive, reproductive systems and sweat glands. This lethal hereditary disease has known or suspected links to the dysbiosis gut microbiota. High-throughput meta-omics-based approaches may assist in unveiling this complex network of symbiosis modifications.The aim of this study was to provide a predictive and functional model of the gut microbiota enterophenotype of pediatric patients affected by CF under clinical stability.Thirty-one fecal samples were collected from CF patients and healthy children (HC) (age range, 1-6 years) and analysed using targeted-metagenomics and metabolomics to characterize the ecology and metabolism of CF-linked gut microbiota. The multidimensional data were low fused and processed by chemometric classification analysis.The fused metagenomics and metabolomics based gut microbiota profile was characterized by a high abundance of Propionibacterium, Staphylococcus and Clostridiaceae, including Clostridium difficile, and a low abundance of Eggerthella, Eubacterium, Ruminococcus, Dorea, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Lachnospiraceae, associated with overexpression of 4-aminobutyrate (GABA), choline, ethanol, propylbutyrate, and pyridine and low levels of sarcosine, 4-methylphenol, uracil, glucose, , phenol, benzaldehyde, and methylacetate. The CF gut microbiota pattern revealed an enterophenotype intrinsically linked to disease, regardless of age, and with dysbiosis uninduced by reduced pancreatic function and only partially related to oral antibiotic administration or lung /infection.All together, the results obtained suggest that the gut microbiota enterophenotypes of CF, together with endogenous and bacterial CF biomarkers, are direct expression of functional alterations at the intestinal level. Hence, it's possible to infer that CFTR impairment causes the gut ecosystem imbalance.This new understanding of CF host-gut microbiota interactions may be helpful to rationalize novel clinical interventions to improve the affected children's nutritional status and intestinal function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27743832>Start-up of an anaerobic fluidized bed reactor treating synthetic carbohydrate rich wastewater.</a></h2><p>The present work studied the start-up process of a mesophilic (37 ± 2 °C) anaerobic fluidized bed reactor (AFBR) operated at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 20 days using synthetic carbohydrate rich wastewater. Anox Kaldness-K1 carriers were used as biofilm carrier material. The reactor performance and biofilm formation were evaluated during the process. The start-up process at lower liquid recirculation flow rate enhanced the biofilm formation and reactor performance. The organic substrate composition had a major impact on early  of methanogenic archaea onto the surface of the Kaldness carriers during the start-up process. Specific organic substrates favouring the growth of methanogenic archaea, such as , are preferred in order to facilitate the subsequent biofilm formation and AFBR start-up. The supply of 'bio-available' nutrients and trace elements, in particular iron, had an important role on optimal methanogenic activity and speeding-up of the biofilm development on the Kaldness carriers. This paper provides possible strategies to optimize the various operational parameters that influence the initial biofilm formation and development in an AFBR and similar high rate anaerobic reactors, hence can be used to reduce the long time required for process start-up.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The fraction of inspired O (FO) and partial pressure of inspired O (PO) were 0.209 and 133.1 ± 0.3 mmHg for NBR and 0.141 ± 0.004 and 90.0 ± 0.4 mmHg for both hypoxic variants (HBR and HAmb; ~4,000 m simulated altitude), respectively. A number of parameters linked to intestinal transit spanning Bristol Stool Scale, defecation rates, zonulin, α-antitrypsin, eosinophil derived neurotoxin, bile acids, reducing sugars, short chain fatty acids, total soluble organic carbon, water content, diet composition, and food intake were measured (167 variables). The abundance, structure, and diversity of butyrate producing microbial community were assessed using the two primary bacterial butyrate synthesis pathways, butyryl-CoA:  CoA-transferase () and butyrate kinase () genes. Inactivity negatively affected fecal consistency and in combination with hypoxia aggravated the state of gut inflammation ( < 0.05). In contrast, gut permeability, various metabolic markers, the structure, diversity, and abundance of butyrate producing microbial community were not significantly affected. Rearrangements in the butyrate producing microbial community structure were explained by experimental setup (13.4%), experimentally structured metabolites (12.8%), and gut metabolite-immunological markers (11.9%), with 61.9% remaining unexplained. Many of the measured parameters were found to be correlated and were hence omitted from further analyses. The observed progressive increase in two immunological intestinal markers suggested that the transition from healthy physiological state toward the developed symptoms of low magnitude obesity-related syndromes was primarily driven by the onset of inactivity (lack of exercise in NBR) that were exacerbated by systemic hypoxia (HBR) and significantly alleviated by exercise, despite hypoxia (HAmb). Butyrate producing community in colon exhibited apparent resilience toward short-term modifications in host exercise or hypoxia. Progressive constipation (decreased intestinal motility) and increased local inflammation marker suggest that changes in microbial  and metabolism were taking place at the location of small intestine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26716685>Fibrolytic Bacteria Isolated from the Rumen of North American Moose (Alces alces) and Their Use as a Probiotic in Neonatal Lambs.</a></h2><p>Fibrolytic bacteria were isolated from the rumen of North American moose (Alces alces), which eat a high-fiber diet of woody browse. It was hypothesized that fibrolytic bacteria isolated from the moose rumen could be used as probiotics to improve fiber degradation and animal production. Thirty-one isolates (Bacillus, n = 26; Paenibacillus, n = 1; and Staphylococcus, n = 4) were cultured from moose rumen digesta samples collected in Vermont. Using Sanger sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, culturing techniques, and optical densities, isolates were identified and screened for biochemical properties important to plant carbohydrate degradation. Five isolates were selected as candidates for use as a probiotic, which was administered daily to neonate lambs for 9 weeks. It was hypothesized that regular administration of a probiotic to improve fibrolysis to neonate animals through weaning would increase the developing rumen bacterial diversity, increase animal production, and allow for long-term  of the probiotic species. Neither weight gain nor wool quality was improved in lambs given a probiotic, however, dietary efficiency was increased as evidenced by the reduced feed intake (and rearing costs) without a loss to weight gain. Experimental lambs had a lower  to propionate ratio than control lambs, which was previously shown to indicate increased dietary efficiency. Fibrolytic bacteria made up the majority of sequences, mainly Prevotella, Butyrivibrio, and Ruminococcus. While protozoal densities increased over time and were stable, methanogen densities varied greatly in the first six months of life for lambs. This is likely due to the changing diet and bacterial populations in the developing rumen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30325010>Th17 responses to pneumococcus in blood and adenoidal cells in children.</a></h2><p>Pneumococcal infections cause a large global health burden, and the search for serotype-independent vaccines continues. Existing conjugate vaccines reduce nasopharyngeal  by target serotypes. Such mucosal effects of novel antigens may similarly be important. CD4 Th17 cell-dependent, antibody-independent reductions in  and enhanced clearance have been described in mice. Here we describe the evaluation of T helper type 17 (Th17) cytokine responses to candidate pneumococcal protein vaccine antigens in human cell culture, using adenoidal and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Optimal detection of interleukin (IL)-17A was at day 7, and of IL-22 at day 11, in these primary cell cultures. Removal of CD45RO memory T cells abolished these responses. Age-associated increases in magnitude of responses were evident for IL-17A, but not IL-22, in adenoidal cells. There was a strong correlation between individual IL-17A and IL-22 responses after pneumococcal antigen stimulation (P < 0·015). Intracellular cytokine staining following phorbol myristate  (PMA)/ionomycin stimulation demonstrated that  > 30% CD4 T cells positive for IL-22 express the innate markers γδT cell receptor and/or CD56, with much lower proportions for IL-17A cells (P < 0·001). Responses to several vaccine candidate antigens were observed but were consistently absent, particularly in blood, to PhtD (P < 0·0001), an antigen recently shown not to impact  in a clinical trial of a PhtD-containing conjugate vaccine in infants. The data presented and approach discussed have the potential to assist in the identification of novel vaccine antigens aimed at reducing pneumococcal carriage and transmission, thus improving the design of empirical clinical trials.© 2018 British Society for Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27913230>Effects of combined oral contraceptives, depot medroxyprogesterone  and the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system on the vaginal microbiome.</a></h2><p>Prior studies suggest that the composition of the vaginal microbiome may positively or negatively affect susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and bacterial vaginosis (BV). Some female hormonal contraceptive methods also appear to positively or negatively influence STI transmission and BV. Therefore, changes in the vaginal microbiome that are associated with different contraceptive methods may explain, in part, effects on STI transmission and BV.We performed a retrospective study of 16S rRNA gene survey data of vaginal samples from a subset of participants from the Human Vaginal Microbiome Project at Virginia Commonwealth University. The subset included 682 women who reported using a single form of birth control that was condoms, combined oral contraceptives (COCs), depot medroxyprogesterone  (DMPA) or the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS).Women using COCs [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13-0.64] and DMPA (aOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13-0.89), but not LNG-IUS (aOR 1.55, 95% CI 0.72-3.35), were less likely to be colonized by BV-associated bacteria relative to women who used condoms. Women using COCs (aOR 1.94, 95% CI 1.25-3.02) were more likely to be colonized by beneficial HO-producing Lactobacillus species compared with women using condoms, while women using DMPA (aOR 1.09, 95% CI 0.63-1.86) and LNG-IUS (aOR 0.74, 95% CI 0.48-1.15) were not.Use of COCs is significantly associated with increased vaginal  by healthy lactobacilli and reduced BV-associated taxa.COC use may positively influence gynecologic health through an increase in healthy lactobacilli and a decrease in BV-associated bacterial taxa.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A total of 242 endophytic fungi were recovered from 602 sample segments of C. inerme; 66 were purified. The 66 fungi belonging to 16 taxa and 11 genera (Alternaria, Nigrospora, Bartalinia, Pestalotiopsis, Fusarium, Mycoleptodiscus, Trichoderma, Phomopsis, Diaporthe, Lasiodiplodia, and Curvularia) were identified by morphological characteristics and fungal internal transcribed spacer sequences. The most abundant genera were Alternaria and Lasiodiplodia. Some of the endophytes exhibited tissue specificity. The  frequencies of endophytes in the stems were evidently higher than those in the roots and leaves. The crude ethyl  extracts were tested against 6 endophytes isolated from C. inerme. Three of 10 (33.3%) endophytes, which were identified as Phomopsis sp, Curvularia sp, and Mycoleptodiscus sp, displayed distinct antifungal activity against ≥3 tested fungi.

Adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) is associated with CD, yet the adaptations facilitating AIEC gut  are unknown. AIEC isolates exhibit high genetic diversity, suggesting strains evolve independently across different gut environments. We tracked the adaptive evolution of AIEC in a murine model of chronic  across multiple hosts and transmission events. We detected evolved lineages that outcompeted the ancestral strain in the host through independent mechanisms. One lineage was hypermotile because of a mobile insertion sequence upstream of the master flagellar regulator, flhDC, which enhanced AIEC invasion and establishment of a mucosal niche. Another lineage outcompeted the ancestral strain through improved use of , a short-chain fatty acid in the gut. The presence of hypermotile and -consuming lineages discriminated E. coli isolated from CD patients from healthy controls, suggesting an evolutionary trajectory that distinguishes AIEC from commensal E. coli.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we identified that APEC acs-yjcH-actP operon, encoding  assimilation system, presented the host-induced transcription during its proliferation in macrophages. Our result showed that this  assimilation system acted as a novel intracellular survival factor to promote APEC replication within macrophages. Furthermore, deletion of acs-yjcH-actP operon in APEC decreased its cytotoxic level to macrophages. qRT-PCR results showed that the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12β, and TNF-α) and iNOS in FY26∆acs-yjcH-actP infected macrophages were obviously down-regulated compared to that in wild-type FY26 infected cells.

However, it is not clear if such immature gut microbiota (GM)  is induced by specific delivery, diet, environment, and/or host factors related to preterm birth. Using piglets as models for infants, we hypothesized that both shortened gestational age (GA) and start of enteral feeding affect GM composition after caesarean delivery and rearing in identical environments.Caesarean-delivered preterm and term pigs were reared in incubators and fed total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or gradually increasing early enteral feeding (EEF) for 5 days, followed by full enteral feeding with bovine milk until day 26. GM composition was determined by 16S rRNA gene-amplicon sequencing and luminal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by GC-MS.Both GA and EEF feeding affected GM composition on day 5, but only the GA effect persisted until day 26. On day 5, Enterobacteriaceae were dominant, with Lachnospiraceae members also being abundant.

The metabolic interactions of bifidobacterial species need investigation because they may offer insight into the  of the gut in early life.  ATCC 15696 hydrolyzes 2'--fucosyl-lactose (2FL; a major fucosylated human milk oligosaccharide) but does not use fucose released into the culture medium. However, fucose is a growth substrate for  24b, and both strains utilize lactose for growth. The provision of fucose and lactose by  (the donor) allowing the growth of  (the beneficiary) conforms to the concept of syntrophy, but both strains will compete for lactose to multiply. To determine the metabolic impact of this syntrophic/competitive relationship on the donor, the transcriptomes of  were determined and compared in steady-state monoculture and coculture using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).  genes upregulated in coculture included those encoding alpha-l-fucosidase and carbohydrate transporters and those involved in energy production and conversion.  abundance was the same in coculture as in monoculture, but  dominated the coculture numerically. Cocultures during steady-state growth in 2FL medium produced mostly  with little lactate (:lactate molar ratio, 8:1) compared to that in monobatch cultures containing lactose (2:1), which reflected the maintenance of steady-state cells in log-phase growth. Darwinian competition is an implicit feature of bacterial communities, but syntrophy is a phenomenon putatively based on cooperation. Our results suggest that the regulation of syntrophy, in addition to competition, may shape bacterial communities. This study addresses the microbiology and function of a natural ecosystem (the infant bowel) using  experimentation with bacterial cultures maintained under controlled growth and environmental conditions. We studied the growth of bifidobacteria whose nutrition centered on the hydrolysis of a human milk oligosaccharide. The results revealed responses relating to metabolism occurring in a  strain when it provided nutrients that allowed the growth of , and so discovered biochemical features of these bifidobacteria in relation to metabolic interaction in the shared environment.

This process of early microbiota establishment, known to be affected by several factors, constitutes an important determinant for later health.We studied the establishment of the microbiota in preterm and full-term infants and the impact of perinatal antibiotics upon this process in premature babies. To this end, 16S rRNA gene sequence-based microbiota assessment was performed at phylum level and functional inference analyses were conducted. Moreover, the levels of the main intestinal microbial metabolites, the short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) , propionate and butyrate, were measured by Gas-Chromatography Flame ionization/Mass spectrometry detection.Prematurity affects microbiota composition at phylum level, leading to increases of Proteobacteria and reduction of other intestinal microorganisms. Perinatal antibiotic use further affected the microbiota of the preterm infant. These changes involved a concomitant alteration in the levels of intestinal SCFA. Moreover, functional inference analyses allowed for identifying metabolic pathways potentially affected by prematurity and perinatal antibiotics use.A deficiency or delay in the establishment of normal microbiota function seems to be present in preterm infants.

Compared to the control treatment without biochar addition, treatments that included biochar particles 2-5 mm, 0.5-1 mm and 75-150 μm in size reduced the methanization lag phase by 23.9%, 23.8% and 5.9%, respectively, and increased the maximum methane production rate by 47.1%, 23.5% and 44.1%, respectively. These results confirmed that biochar accelerated the initiation of methanization during anaerobic digestion under double inhibition risk from both ammonium and acids. Furthermore, fine biochar significantly promoted the production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs). Comparative analysis on the archaeal and bacterial diversity at the early and later stages of digestion, and in the suspended, biochar loosely bound, and biochar tightly bound fractions suggested that, in suspended fractions, hydrogenotrophic Methanobacterium was actively resistant to ammonium. However, acetoclastic Methanosaeta can survive at VFAs concentrations up to 60-80 mmol-C/L by improved affinity to conductive biochar, resulting in the accelerated initiation of  degradation.

Contraception was initiated with an injectable (depot medroxyprogesterone  [n = 41], norethisterone enanthate [n = 44], or medroxyprogesterone  and ethinyl estradiol [n = 40]), implant (levonorgestrel [n = 45] or etonogestrel [n = 48]), or copper intrauterine device (n = 48) and repeat vaginal swabs were collected after 30, 90, and 180 days of continuous use. Self-reported condom use was similar across all arms at baseline. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect Lactobacillus crispatus, L jensenii, L gasseri/johnsonii group, L vaginalis, L iners, Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, and Megasphaera-like bacterium phylotype I from swabs. Modified Poisson regression and mixed effects linear models were used to compare marginal prevalence and mean difference in quantity (expressed as gene copies/swab) prior to and during contraceptive use.Bacterial vaginosis prevalence increased in women initiating copper intrauterine devices from 27% at baseline, 35% at 30 days, 40% at 90 days, and 49% at 180 days (P = .005 compared to marginal prevalence at enrollment). Women initiating hormonal methods had no change in bacterial vaginosis prevalence over 180 days. The mean increase in Nugent score was 1.2 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-2.0; P = .001) in women using copper intrauterine devices. Although the frequency and density of beneficial lactobacilli did not change among intrauterine device users over 6 months, there was an increase in the log concentration of G vaginalis (4.7, 5.2, 5.8, 5.9; P = .046) and A vaginae (3.0, 3.8, 4.6, 5.1; P = .002) between baseline and 30, 90, and 180 days after initiation. Among other contraceptive groups, women using depot medroxyprogesterone  had decreased L iners (mean decrease log concentration = 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-1.5; P = .004) and there were no significant changes in beneficial Lactobacillus species over 180 days regardless of contraceptive method used.Copper intrauterine device use may increase  by bacterial vaginosis-associated microbiota, resulting in increased prevalence of bacterial vaginosis.

Despite its prevalence, its mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood. Peptidoglycan (PG) is important for helical shape, , and host-pathogen interactions in C. jejuni Therefore, changes in PG greatly impact the physiology of this organism. O-acetylation of peptidoglycan (OAP) is a bacterial phenomenon proposed to be important for proper cell growth, characterized by acetylation of the C6 hydroxyl group of N-acetylmuramic acid in the PG glycan backbone. The OAP gene cluster consists of a PG O-acetyltransferase A (patA) for translocation of  into the periplasm, a PG O-acetyltransferase B (patB) for O-acetylation, and an O-acetylpeptidoglycan esterase (ape1) for de-O-acetylation. In this study, reduced OAP in ΔpatA and ΔpatB had minimal impact on C. jejuni growth and fitness under the conditions tested. However, accumulation of OAP in Δape1 resulted in marked differences in PG biochemistry, including O-acetylation, anhydromuropeptide levels, and changes not expected to result directly from Ape1 activity. This suggests that OAP may be a form of substrate level regulation in PG biosynthesis. Ape1 acetylesterase activity was confirmed in vitro using p-nitrophenyl  and O-acetylated PG as substrates. In addition, Δape1 exhibited defects in pathogenesis-associated phenotypes, including cell shape, motility, biofilm formation, cell surface hydrophobicity, and sodium deoxycholate sensitivity. Δape1 was also impaired for chick  and adhesion, invasion, intracellular survival, and induction of IL-8 production in INT407 cells in vitro The importance of Ape1 in C. jejuni biology makes it a good candidate as an antimicrobial target.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30143505>Reduced-Particle-Size Wheat Bran Is Efficiently Colonized by a Lactic Acid-Producing Community and Reduces Levels of Enterobacteriaceae in the Cecal Microbiota of Broilers.</a></h2><p>In the present study, we investigated whether reducing the particle size of wheat bran affects the colonizing microbial community using batch fermentations with cecal inocula from seven different chickens. We also investigated the effect of in-feed administration of regular wheat bran (WB; 1,690 μm) and wheat bran with reduced particle size (WB280; 280 μm) on the cecal microbial community composition of broilers.

The relative abundances of the  decreased in the particle-associated communities for both WB and WB280 compared to that of the control. In addition, the community attached to wheat bran was enriched in xylan-degrading bacteria.

Most EPEC and non-O157 EHEC strains express lymphostatin (also known as LifA), a chromosomally encoded 365-kDa protein. We previously demonstrated that lymphostatin is a putative glycosyltransferase that is important in intestinal  of cattle by EHEC serogroup O5, O111, and O26 strains. However, the nature and consequences of the interaction between lymphostatin and immune cells from the bovine host are ill defined. Using purified recombinant protein, we demonstrated that lymphostatin inhibits mitogen-activated proliferation of bovine T cells and, to a lesser extent, proliferation of cytokine-stimulated B cells, but not NK cells. It broadly affected the T cell compartment, inhibiting all cell subsets (CD4, CD8, WC-1, and γδ T cell receptor [γδ-TCR]) and cytokines examined (interleukin 2 [IL-2], IL-4, IL-10, IL-17A, and gamma interferon [IFN-γ]) and rendered T cells refractory to mitogen for a least 18 h after transient exposure. Lymphostatin was also able to inhibit proliferation of T cells stimulated by IL-2 and by antigen presentation using a Theileria-transformed cell line and autologous T cells from Theileria-infected cattle. We conclude that lymphostatin is likely to act early in T cell activation, as stimulation of T cells with concanavalin A, but not phorbol 12-myristate 13- combined with ionomycin, was inhibited. Finally, a homologue of lymphostatin from E. coli O157:H7 (ToxB; L7095) was also found to possess comparable inhibitory activity against T cells, indicating a potentially conserved strategy for interference in adaptive responses by attaching and effacing E. coli.Copyright © 2017 Cassady-Cain et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27991430>Bacteria in the airways of patients with cystic fibrosis are genetically capable of producing VOCs in breath.</a></h2><p>Breath contains hundreds of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the composition of which is altered in a wide variety of diseases. Bacteria are implicated in the formation of VOCs, but the biochemical mechanisms that lead to the formation of breath VOCs remain largely hypothetical. We hypothesized that bacterial DNA fragments in sputum of CF patients could be sequenced to identify whether the bacteria present were capable of producing VOCs found in the breath of these patients. Breath from seven patients with cystic fibrosis was sampled and analyzed by gas-chromatography and mass-spectrometry. Sputum samples were also collected and microbial DNA was isolated. Metagenomic sequencing was performed and the DNA fragments were compared to a reference database with genes that are linked to the metabolism of acetaldehyde, ethanol and methanol in the KEGG database. Bacteria in the genera Escherichia, Lactococcus, Pseudomonas, Rothia and Streptococcus were found to have the genetic potential to produce acetaldehyde and ethanol. Only DNA sequences from Lactococcus were implicated in the formation of acetaldehyde from  through aldehyde dehydrogenase family 9 member A1 (K00149). Escherichia was found to be genetically capable of producing ethanol in all patients, whilst there was considerable heterogeneity between patients for the other genera. The ethanol concentration in breath positively correlated with the amount of Escherichia found in sputum (Spearman rho  =  0.85,  P  =  0.015). Rothia showed the most versatile genetic potential for producing methanol. To conclude, bacterial DNA fragments in sputum of CF patients can be linked to enzymes implicated in the production of ethanol, acetaldehyde and methanol, which are VOCs that are predictive of respiratory tract  and/or infection. This supports that the lung microbiome can produce VOCs directly.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30575294>Probiotic research in neonates with congenital gastrointestinal surgical conditions - Now is the time.</a></h2><p>Neonates with congenital gastrointestinal surgical conditions (CGISC) receive parenteral nutrition, get exposed to multiple courses of antibiotics, undergo invasive procedures, and are nursed in intensive care units. They do not receive early enteral feeding and have limited opportunities for skin to skin contact with their mothers. Many of these infants receive gastric acid suppression therapies. All these factors increase the risk of gut dysbiosis in these infants. Gut dysbiosis is known to be associated with increased risk of infections and other morbidities in ICU patients. Experimental studies have shown that probiotics inhibit gut  with pathogenic bacteria, enhance gut barrier function, facilitate  with healthy commensals, protect from enteropathogenic infection through production of , reduce antimicrobial resistance, enhance innate immunity, and increase the maturation of the enteric nervous system and promote gut peristalsis. Through these mechanisms, probiotics have the potential to decrease the risk of sepsis and inflammation, improve feed tolerance and minimise cholestasis in neonates with CGISC. Among preterm non-surgical infants, evidence from more than 35 RCTs and multiple observational studies have shown probiotics to be safe and beneficial. A RCT in neonates (N=24) with gastroschisis found that probiotic supplementation partially attenuated gut dysbiosis. Two ongoing RCTs (total N=168) in neonates with gastrointestinal surgical conditions are expected to provide feasibility data to enable the conduct of large RCTs. Rigorous quality assurance of the probiotic product, ongoing microbial surveillance and clinical vigilance are warranted while conducting such RCTs.© 2018 The Authors.

As a result, many rivers and oceans are contaminated. It is urgent to control and administer treatments to these contaminated rivers and oceans. However, most mechanisms of bacterial  in contaminated rivers and oceans were unknown, especially in sewage outlets. We found  to be the primary bacteria in the terrestrial sewage wastewater outlets around Ningbo City, China. Therefore, in this study, we applied a combination of differential proteomics, metabolomics, and real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR techniques to identify bacteria intracellular metabolites. We found  had 12 different proteins differentially expressed in freshwater culture than when grown in wastewater, referring to the formation of biological membranes (Omp35, OmpW), energy metabolism (SOD, deoxyribose-phosphate pyrophosphokinase), fatty acid metabolism (beta-ketoacyl synthase), secondary metabolism, TCA cycle, lysine degradation (2-oxoglutarate reductase), and propionic acid metabolism (succinyl coenzyme A synthetase). The sequences of these 12 differentially expressed proteins were aligned with sequences downloaded from NCBI. There are also 27 differentially concentrated metabolites detected by NMR, including alcohols (ethanol, isopropanol), amines (dimethylamine, ethanolamine), amino acids (alanine, leucine), amine compounds (bilinerurine), nucleic acid compounds (nucleosides, inosines), and organic acids (formate, ). Formate and ethanolamine show significant difference between the two environments and are possibly involved in energy metabolism, glycerophospholipid and ether lipids metabolism to provide energy supply, and material basis for engraftment in sewage.

We aimed to prepare and characterize novel 7% boron-modified bioactive glass (7B-BG) containing bilayered membrane for this end. We hypothesized that presence of 7B-BG could promote structural and biological properties of guided bone regeneration (GBR) membrane. Cellulose  (CA) layer was prepared by solvent casting, and functionally graded layer of CA/gelatin/BG nanoparticles was prepared by electrospinning. 0B-BG, and 7B-BG were synthesized by quick alkali-mediated sol-gel method and were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier-transform Raman spectroscopy. Membranes were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde to preserve their stability. SEM analysis showed the asymmetric nature of membranes consisting of a smooth membrane layer and a rough surface composed of 0B-BG and 7B-BG containing nanofibres. 7B-BG addition increased surface wettability (from 110.5° ± 0.8 to 73.46° ± 7.6) and biodegradability of the membranes. Additionally, a significant increase in Ca-P layer formation was observed in 7B-BG containing group after 1-week incubation in stimulated body fluid. 7B-BG incorporation resulted in a decrease in tensile strength and Young's modulus values. Human dental pulp stem cells showed better attachment, spreading, and proliferation on 7B-BG containing bilayered membranes. Osteogenic differentiation analysis revealed higher alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzyme activity of cells (~1.5-fold), higher intracellular calcium deposition (approximately twofold), and higher calcium deposition revealed by Alizarin red staining on 7B-BG containing bilayered membranes. Overall, results suggested that functionally graded bilayered membranes hold potential for GBR applications in regenerative dentistry.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26302882>Effect of sodium  on the adhesion to porcine gastric mucin in a Lactococcus lactis strain grown on fructose.</a></h2><p>The association of lactic acid bacteria with mucosal surfaces plays important roles in the beneficial effects of these bacteria on human health, such as  of the gastrointestinal tract for pathogen antagonism. Previously, we found that the adhesion of Lactococcus lactis 7-1 to porcine gastric mucin was higher with fructose than with lactose, galactose or xylose as the carbon source. In this study, we examined the effect of growth conditions on the adhesion of strain 7-1 grown on fructose. Medium components affect the adhesion: the adhesion of strain 7-1 grown with sodium  was higher than that without it. The enhancement of adhesion by sodium  was not observed under aerobic conditions. Cellular properties grown with or without sodium  were characterized: strain 7-1 grown with sodium  had similar sugar contents, and different fatty acid composition to those grown without it. Strain 7-1 grown with sodium  showed significantly lower cell yield and significantly higher hydrophobicity than those grown without it, which is associated with higher adhesion.

To this end, we performed a pooled analysis on 2,387 metagenomic/transcriptomic samples from 15 publicly available data sets that originated from three continents and encompassed eight diseases as well as specific interventions. For analyses, a gene catalogue was constructed from gene-targeted assemblies of all genes from butyrate synthesis pathways of all samples and from an updated reference database derived from genome screenings. We demonstrate that butyrate producers establish themselves within the first year of life and display high abundances (>20% of total bacterial community) in adults regardless of origin. Various bacteria form this functional group, exhibiting a biochemical diversity including different pathways and terminal enzymes, where one carbohydrate-fueled pathway was dominant with butyryl coenzyme A (CoA): CoA transferase as the main terminal enzyme. Subjects displayed a high richness of butyrate producers, and 17 taxa, primarily members of the  and  along with some , were detected in >70% of individuals, encompassing ~85% of the total butyrate-producing potential. Most of these key taxa were also found to express genes for butyrate formation, indicating that butyrate producers occupy various niches in the gut ecosystem, concurrently synthesizing that compound. Furthermore, results from longitudinal analyses propose that diversity supports functional stability during ordinary life disturbances and during interventions such as antibiotic treatment. A reduction of the butyrate-producing potential along with community alterations was detected in various diseases, where patients suffering from cardiometabolic disorders were particularly affected.  Studies focusing on taxonomic compositions of the gut microbiota are plentiful, whereas its functional capabilities are still poorly understood. Specific key functions deserve detailed investigations, as they regulate microbiota-host interactions and promote host health and disease. The production of butyrate is among the top targets since depletion of this microbe-derived metabolite is linked to several emerging noncommunicable diseases and was shown to facilitate establishment of enteric pathogens by disrupting  resistance. In this study, we established a workflow to investigate in detail the composition of the polyphyletic butyrate-producing community from omics data extracting its biochemical and taxonomic diversity. By combining information from various publicly available data sets, we identified universal ecological key features of this functional group and shed light on its role in health and disease.

Previous studies have indicated that proton-translocating proteins utilizing oxygen as terminal electron acceptor do not appear to be of major importance in the gut of the newly hatched chicken and consequently they would be even less significant during intestinal  of more mature chickens where the complex gut microflora would trap most of the oxygen in the lumen. Consequently, alternative electron acceptors may be more significant or, in their absence, substrate-level phosphorylation may also be important to Salmonella serovars in this environment. To investigate this we constructed mutants of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium defective in various aspects of oxidative or substrate-level phosphorylation to assess their role in  of the chicken intestine, assessed through faecal shedding, and virulence. Mutations affecting use of oxygen or alternative electron acceptors did not eliminate faecal shedding. By contrast mutations in either pta (phosphotransacetylase) or ackA ( kinase) abolished shedding. The pta but not the ackA mutation also abolished systemic virulence for chickens. An additional ldhA (lactate dehydrogenase) mutant also showed poor colonizing ability.

We present a comprehensive multi-omics view of the effect of intestinal microbial  on hepatic lipid metabolism, integrating transcriptomic, proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and lipidomic analyses of liver and plasma samples from germfree and specific pathogen-free mice. Microbes induce monounsaturated fatty acid generation by stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 and polyunsaturated fatty acid elongation by fatty acid elongase 5, leading to significant alterations in glycerophospholipid acyl-chain profiles. A composite classification score calculated from the observed alterations in fatty acid profiles in germfree mice clearly differentiates antibiotic-treated mice from untreated controls with high sensitivity.

The lack of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in the seawater suggests that the N-demand of these meadows might be in part supported by microbial dinitrogen (N) fixation. However, currently there are no direct N fixation measurements available for this productive marine macrophyte. Here we investigated N fixation activity associated with P. oceanica leaf, rhizome and root pieces. In 15N incubations, the roots exhibited highest rates of N fixation. The rates varied considerably between replicates, presumably due to a patchy microbial  of the roots. Additions of organic carbon compounds (, glucose, sucrose or algal lysate) did not enhance the N fixation rates. Sulfate reduction rates measured alongside were also highest in root incubations. Correspondingly, sequences of the nifH gene (a marker gene for the iron protein of the N-fixing enzyme nitrogenase) related to known sulfate-reducing bacteria were retrieved from P. oceanica roots. Other nifH sequences clustered with known heterotrophic diazotrophs previously identified in other marine macrophytes. In particular, many sequences obtained from P. oceanica roots were similar (>94%) to a saltmarsh rhizosphere-associated heterotrophic diazotroph, indicating that heterotrophic lifestyle might be common among marine macrophyte-associated diazotrophs.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Increased diversity in the vaginal microbiota modulates genital inflammation and is associated with increased HIV-1 acquisition. However, the effect of MPA on diversity of the vaginal microbiota is relatively unknown. In a cohort of female Kenyan sex workers, negative for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), with Nugent scores <7 (=58 of 370 screened), MPA correlated with significantly increased diversity of the vaginal microbiota as assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. MPA was also significantly associated with decreased levels of estrogen in the plasma, and low vaginal glycogen and α-amylase, factors implicated in vaginal  by lactobacilli, bacteria that are believed to protect against STIs. In a humanized mouse model, MPA treatment was associated with low serum estrogen, low glycogen and enhanced HIV-1 susceptibility. The mechanism by which the MPA-mediated changes in the vaginal microbiota may contribute to HIV-1 susceptibility in humans appears to be independent of inflammatory cytokines and/or activated T cells. Altogether, these results suggest MPA-induced hypo-estrogenism may alter key metabolic components that are necessary for vaginal  by certain bacterial species including lactobacilli, and allow for greater bacterial diversity in the vaginal microbiota.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.© 2019.

Bacteria can diverge in sympatry when ecological opportunities allow, but the underlying genetic mechanisms are often unknown. Perhaps, the longest-lasting adaptive diversification seen in the laboratory occurred during the long-term evolution experiment, in which 12 populations of Escherichia coli have been evolving independently for more than 65,000 generations from a common ancestor. In one population, two lineages, S and L, emerged at ~6500 generations and have dynamically coexisted ever since by negative frequency-dependent interactions mediated, in part, by  secretion by L. Mutations in spoT, arcA, and gntR promoted the emergence of the S lineage, although they reproduced only partially its phenotypic traits. Here, we characterize the evolved mechanism of  consumption by the S lineage that enabled invasion and coexistence with the L lineage. We identified an additional mutation in acs that, together with the arcA mutation, drove an early restructuring of the transcriptional control of central metabolism in S, leading to improved  consumption. Pervasive epistatic interactions within the S genome contributed to the exploitation of this new ecological opportunity.

Moreover, retrospective analysis has suggested that corticosteroid use in humans is associated with an increased risk of keratitis in eyes with pre-existing disease. Thus, while corticosteroids are often used to reduce ocular inflammation in the absence of infection, the risk of opportunistic infection remains a concern. However, the effect of corticosteroids on the intrinsic barrier function of uninfected corneas is unknown. Here, we tested if short-term topical corticosteroid treatment of an uninfected murine cornea would increase susceptibility to P. aeruginosa  or infection after epithelial injury. Topical prednisolone  (1%) was administered to one eye of C57BL/6 mice three times a day for 3 days; control eyes were treated with sterile PBS. Prior to inoculation with a cytotoxic P. aeruginosa corneal isolate strain 6206, corneas were subject to superficial-injury by tissue paper blotting, or scratch-injured followed by 12 h of healing. Previously we have shown that blotting renders mouse corneas susceptible to P. aeruginosa adhesion, but not infection, while 12 h healing reduces susceptibility to infection after scratching. Corneas were evaluated at 48 h for bacterial  and microbial keratitis (MK). To monitor impact on wound healing, corneal integrity was examined by fluorescein staining immediately after scarification and after 12 h healing. For both the tissue paper blotting and scratch-injury models, there was no significant difference in P. aeruginosa  at 48 h between corticosteroid-pretreated eyes and controls. With the blotting model, one case of MK was observed in a control (PBS-pretreated) cornea; none in corticosteroid-pretreated corneas. With the 12 h healing model, MK occurred in 6 of 17 corticosteroid-pretreated eyes versus 2 of 17 controls, a difference not statistically significant. Corticosteroid-pretreated eyes showed greater fluorescein staining 12 h after scarification injury, but this did not coincide with increased  or MK. Together, these data show that short-term topical corticosteroid therapy on an uninfected murine cornea does not necessarily enhance its susceptibility to P. aeruginosa  or infection after injury, even when it induces fluorescein staining.Copyright © 2018.

CrbS/R governs expression of acetyl-CoA synthase (acsA), an enzyme that converts  to acetyl-CoA, a metabolite at the nexus of the cell's most important energy-harvesting and biosynthetic reactions. During infection, bacteria can utilize this system to hijack host  metabolism and alter the course of  and pathogenesis. In toxigenic strains of Vibrio cholerae, CrbS/R-dependent expression of acsA is required for virulence in an arthropod model. Here, we investigate the function of the CrbS/R system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas entomophila, and non-toxigenic V. cholerae strains. We demonstrate that its role in  metabolism is conserved; this system regulates expression of the acsA gene and is required for growth on  as a sole carbon source. As a first step towards describing the mechanism of signaling through this pathway, we identify residues and domains that may be critical for phosphotransfer. We further demonstrate that although CrbS, the putative hybrid sensor kinase, carries both a histidine kinase domain and a receiver domain, the latter is not required for acsA transcription. In order to determine whether our findings are relevant to pathogenesis, we tested our strains in a Drosophila model of oral infection previously employed for the study of -dependent virulence by V. cholerae. We show that non-toxigenic V. cholerae strains lacking CrbS or CrbR are significantly less virulent than are wild-type strains, while P. aeruginosa and P. entomophila lacking CrbS or CrbR are fully pathogenic. Together, the data suggest that the CrbS/R system plays a central role in  metabolism in V. cholerae, P. aeruginosa, and P. entomophila.

Here, we combined cultivation-independent 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metaproteomics to investigate the functional maturation of gut microbiota in faecal samples from full-term healthy infants collected at 6 and 18 months of age. Phylogenetic analysis of the metaproteomes showed that Bifidobacterium provided the highest number of distinct protein groups. Considerable divergences between taxa abundance and protein phylogeny were observed at all taxonomic ranks. Age had a profound effect on early microbiota where compositional and functional diversity of less dissimilar communities increased with time. Comparisons of the relative abundances of proteins revealed the transition of taxon-associated saccharolytic and fermentation strategies from milk and mucin-derived monosaccharide catabolism feeding /propanoate synthesis to complex food-derived hexoses fuelling butanoate production. Furthermore, co-occurrence network analysis uncovered two anti-correlated modules of functional taxa.

The butyrate-producing bacterium Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum (a clostridial cluster IV strain) is such a promising probiotic candidate for people suffering from inflammatory bowel disease. To exert its beneficial properties, it is crucial that B. pullicaecorum survives the harsh conditions of the upper gastrointestinal tract to arrive in the colon in a viable and metabolically active state. Before developing a stable formulation of B. pullicaecorum for oral administration, it is important to know its intrinsic acid and bile tolerance. We monitored the survival during and short chain fatty acid production after incubation in conditions simulating the stomach and small intestine using in vitro batch experiments. In case of acid conditions (pH 2 and pH 3), B. pullicaecorum was viable and active but not cultivable. Cultivability was restored during subsequent small intestine conditions. Importantly, bile and pancreatic juice had no lethal effect. Milk, as a suspension medium, only had a protective effect on the cultivability during the first hour at pH 2. B. pullicaecorum was still metabolically active after upper gastrointestinal conditions and produced short chain fatty acids, but a shift from butyrate to  production was observed.

Monophagous herbivore species are highly specialized, but even within their only host species the chemistry varies. The herbivore's choice is initially mainly guided by volatile plant compounds. Once on the plant, particularly for aphids the phloem quality affects their performance. However, little is known about the intraspecific and intra-individual variation in phloem sap and their influences on monophagous aphids. To determine potential mechanisms involved in aphid , we tested the effects of intraspecific chemical variation in Tanacetum vulgare, which produces different chemotypes, on the preference of two monophagous aphid species. Moreover, we measured the performance of the aphids on different plant parts (stem close to the inflorescence, young and old leaves) of these chemotypes and analyzed their phloem sap composition. Both species preferred the β-thujone (THU) over the trans-carvyl  (CAR) chemotype in dual-choice assays. Survival of Macrosiphoniella tanacetaria was neither affected by intraspecific nor intra-individual variation, whereas the reproduction was highest on stems. In contrast, Uroleucon tanaceti survived and reproduced best on old leaves of the preferred chemotype. The sugar, organic acid and amino acid composition pronouncedly differed between phloem exudates of different plant parts, but less between chemotypes. Unexpectedly, high concentrations of amino acids did not necessarily enhance aphid performance. These different performance optima may cause niche differentiation and, therefore, enable co-existence. In conclusion, the tremendous variation in plant chemistry even within one species can affect the distribution of highly specialized aphids at various scales aphid species-specifically.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30340996>De-O-Acetylation of mucin-derived sialic acids by recombinant NanS-p esterases of Escherichia coli O157:H7 strain EDL933.</a></h2><p>Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 strain EDL933 encodes the single chromosomal 9-O-acetylesterase NanS, and several copies of prophage-encoded 9-O-acetylesterases (NanS-p). These enzymes have recently been shown to cleave 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetyl neuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac) to yield de-O-acetylated Neu5Ac, the latter of which may serve as a carbon and/or nitrogen source. In the current study, we investigated the NanS- and NanS-p-mediated digestion of synthetic O-acetylated neuraminic acids and bovine submaxillary glands mucin (BSM)-derived O-acetylneuraminic acids by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) and nano electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nanoESI MS). Initial HPTLC analyses showed the expected activity of NanS and NanS-p variants for Neu5,9Ac. However, all tested enzymes were unable to de-O-acetylate 5-N-acetyl-4-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,4 Ac) in our test system. The nanoESI MS analysis of neuraminic acids after treatment of BSM with NanS-p gave evidence that NanS-p variants of EHEC O157:H7 strain EDL933 cleave off O-acetyl groups from mono-, di-, and tri-O-acetylated Neu5Ac and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), regardless of the carbon positions C7, C8 or C9 of the  esters. This enzyme activity leads to neuraminidase-accessible Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc on mucin glycans. Moreover, we could demonstrate by HPTLC analyses that recombinant Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron sialidase (BTSA-His) was able to cleave Neu5Ac and Neu5,9Ac from BSM and that the combination of BTSA-His with both NanS-His and NanS-p-His derivatives enhanced the release of de-O-acetylated core Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc from mammalian mucin O-glycans. Growth experiments with EHEC wildtype strain EDL933, its nanS and nanS/nanS-p1a-p7 mutant and exogenous BTSA-His in BSM demonstrated that the presence of BTSA-His enhanced growth of EDL933 and the nanS deletion mutant but not the nanS/nanS-p1a-p7 mutant. Thus, we hypothesize that the expression of sialic acid O-acetylesterases with a broad specificity could be an advantage in competition with the gut microbiota for nutrients and facilitate EHEC  in the human large intestine.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

Previous studies pointed to a functional link between immunomodulation, histamine production, and folate metabolism, the central 1-carbon pathway for the transfer of methyl groups. Using mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy, we analyzed folate metabolites of L. reuteri strain 6475 and discovered that the bacterium produces a 2-carbon-transporting folate in the form of 5,10-ethenyl-tetrahydrofolyl polyglutamate. Isotopic labeling permitted us to trace the source of the 2-carbon unit back to  of the culture medium. We show that the 2C folate cycle of L. reuteri is capable of transferring 2 carbon atoms to homocysteine to generate the unconventional amino acid ethionine, a known immunomodulator. When we treated monocytic THP-1 cells with ethionine, their transcription of TNF-α was inhibited and cell proliferation reduced. Mass spectrometry of THP-1 histones revealed incorporation of ethionine instead of methionine into proteins, a reduction of histone-methylation, and ethylation of histone lysine residues. Our findings suggest that the microbiome can expose the host to ethionine through a novel 2-carbon transporting variant of the folate cycle and modify human chromatin via ethylation.-Röth, D., Chiang, A.

This study sought to determine whether provision of an initial course of  subsp.  () would lead to persistent  of the probiotic organism in breastfed infants. Mothers intending to breastfeed were recruited and provided with lactation support. One group of mothers fed  EVC001 to their infants from day 7 to day 28 of life ( = 34), and the second group did not administer any probiotic ( = 32). Fecal samples were collected during the first 60 postnatal days in both groups. Fecal samples were assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, quantitative PCR, mass spectrometry, and endotoxin measurement. -fed infants had significantly higher populations of fecal , in particular , while EVC001 was fed, and this difference persisted more than 30 days after EVC001 supplementation ceased. Fecal milk oligosaccharides were significantly lower in  EVC001-fed infants, demonstrating higher consumption of human milk oligosaccharides by  EVC001. Concentrations of  and lactate were significantly higher and fecal pH was significantly lower in infants fed EVC001, demonstrating alterations in intestinal fermentation. Infants colonized by  at high levels had 4-fold-lower fecal endotoxin levels, consistent with observed lower levels of Gram-negative  and .  The gut microbiome in early life plays an important role for long-term health and is shaped in large part by diet. Probiotics may contribute to improvements in health, but they have not been shown to alter the community composition of the gut microbiome. Here, we found that breastfed infants could be stably colonized at high levels by provision of  EVC001, with significant changes to the overall microbiome composition persisting more than a month later, whether the infants were born vaginally or by caesarean section. This observation is consistent with previous studies demonstrating the capacity of this subspecies to utilize human milk glycans as a nutrient and underscores the importance of pairing a probiotic organism with a specific substrate.  by  EVC001 resulted in significant changes to fecal microbiome composition and was associated with improvements in fecal biochemistry. The combination of human milk and an infant-associated  sp. shows, for the first time, that durable changes to the human gut microbiome are possible and are associated with improved gut function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27257952>Campylobacter jejuni CsrA Regulates Metabolic and Virulence Associated Proteins and Is Necessary for Mouse .</a></h2><p>Campylobacter jejuni infection is a leading bacterial cause of gastroenteritis and a common antecedent leading to Gullian-Barré syndrome. Our previous data suggested that the RNA-binding protein CsrA plays an important role in regulating several important phenotypes including motility, biofilm formation, and oxidative stress resistance. In this study, we compared the proteomes of wild type, csrA mutant, and complemented csrA mutant C. jejuni strains in an effort to elucidate the mechanisms by which CsrA affects virulence phenotypes. The putative CsrA regulon was more pronounced at stationary phase (111 regulated proteins) than at mid-log phase (25 regulated proteins). Proteins displaying altered expression in the csrA mutant included diverse metabolic functions, with roles in amino acid metabolism, TCA cycle,  metabolism, and various other cell processes, as well as pathogenesis-associated characteristics such as motility, chemotaxis, oxidative stress resistance, and fibronectin binding. The csrA mutant strain also showed altered autoagglutination kinetics when compared to the wild type. CsrA specifically bound the 5' end of flaA mRNA, and we demonstrated that CsrA is a growth-phase dependent repressor of FlaA expression. Finally, the csrA mutant exhibited reduced ability to colonize in a mouse model when in competition with the wild type, further underscoring the role of CsrA in C. jejuni  and pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31316583>Amelioration of biomass and lipid in marine alga by an endophytic fungus .</a></h2><p>Many studies have been carried out on the growth-modulating efficiency of plants by the  of an endophytic fungus  However, studies involving the co-culture of alga with endophytic fungal strains for enhanced biodiesel production are rare. In this study, the interaction between  and -I, a marine algal strain, was assessed at metabolic level.In association with an endophytic fungus, the algal biomass enhanced from 471.6 to 704 mg/L, and the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profile of -I increased substantially. In case of FAME profile of co-cultured -I, two essential components of biodiesel, i.e. elaidic acid and oleic acid, increased by 1.4- and 1.8-fold, respectively. To ascertain changes in the metabolic profile of -I by  co-culture, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based untargeted metabolomics study was performed to identify the metabolites involved; and differential nature of the essential metabolites was also confirmed using HPLC and LC-MS. Significant modulation of the bioactive metabolites such as succinate, oxo-propanoate, l-alanine, glutamate,  and 1,2 propanediol, hydroxy butane was observed.The metabolites like glutamate and succinate that usually belong to the GABA shunt pathway were observed to be upregulated. The pathway links nitrogen metabolism and carbon metabolism, thus influencing the growth and lipid profile of the algae. These differential metabolites thus indicated the important commensal association between the endophytic fungus and autotrophic marine alga, and established that endophytic fungus can be handy for the sustainability of algal biofuel industries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28912861> abundant  in human gastrointestinal tract.</a></h2><p> can produce short-chain fatty acids, including  and propionate, and can be associated with the metabolic state and mood of the host.

Kurz (Crassulaceae) is a plant known for its antiulcer properties.This study evaluates the anti-Helicobacter pylori activity of Bryophyllum pinnutum methanol extract with a mouse model and its antioxidant properties.Dried leaves of Bryophyllum pinnutum were extracted with methanol and ethyl . Broth microdilution method was used to evaluate the anti-Helicobacter activity of extract samples in vitro. Swiss mice were inoculated with a suspension of Helicobacter pylori and divided into control group and four others that received 125, 250, 500 mg/kg of methanol extract or ciprofloxacin (500 mg/kg), respectively, for 7 days. Helicobacter pylori  and bacterial load of mouse stomach was assessed on day 1 and 7 post-treatment. The antioxidant activity of Bryophyllum pinnutum was evaluated through DPPH radical, hydroxyl radical and reducing power assay.Methanol extract showed a significant anti-Helicobacter activity with MIC and MBC values of 32 and 256 μg/mL, respectively. Bryophyllum pinnatum and ciprofloxacin reduced H. pylori  of gastric tissue from 100% to 17%. Bryophyllum pinnatum extract (85.91 ± 52.91 CFU) and standard (25.74 ± 16.15 CFU) also reduced significantly (p < 0.05) bacterial load of gastric mucosa as compared to untreated infected mice (11883 ± 1831 CFU). DPPH radical, hydroxyl radical and reducing power assays showed IC values of 25.31 ± 0.34, 55.94 ± 0.68 and 11.18 ± 0.74 μg/mL, respectively.The data suggest that the methanol extract of Bryophyllum pinnatum could inhibit Helicobacter pylori growth, and may also acts as an antioxidant to protect gastric mucosa against reactive oxygen species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30949192>Both  and  Infections Promote the Ripening of Apples and Release Specific Volatile Compounds.</a></h2><p>Blue mold and core rot caused by  and  are major diseases of apple fruit in China; however, their differential aggressiveness in apples and effect on fruit postharvest physiology are unclear.

The distinct microenvironmental conditions within the gut and possible interactions among the microorganisms make it essential to investigate how far the metabolic properties of pure cultures reflect their activities in their natural environment. We established the cockroach Shelfordella lateralis as a gnotobiotic model and inoculated germfree nymphs with two bacterial strains isolated from the guts of conventional cockroaches. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that both strains specifically colonized the germfree hindgut. In diassociated cockroaches, the facultatively anaerobic strain EbSL (a new species of Enterobacteriaceae) always outnumbered the obligately anaerobic strain FuSL (a close relative of Fusobacterium varium), irrespective of the sequence of inoculation, which showed that precolonization by facultatively anaerobic bacteria does not necessarily favor  by obligate anaerobes. Comparison of the fermentation products of the cultures formed in vitro with those accumulated in situ indicated that the gut environment strongly affected the metabolic activities of both strains. The pure cultures formed the typical products of mixed-acid or butyrate fermentation, whereas the guts of gnotobiotic cockroaches accumulated mostly lactate and . Similar shifts toward more-oxidized products were observed when the pure cultures were exposed to oxygen, which corroborated the strong effects of oxygen on the metabolic fluxes previously observed in termite guts. Oxygen microsensor profiles of the guts of germfree, gnotobiotic, and conventional cockroaches indicated that both gut tissue and microbiota contribute to oxygen consumption and suggest that the oxygen status influences the  success.Copyright © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Small intestine ILC2s constitutively express the IL-25 receptor, which is negatively regulated by A20 (Tnfaip3). A20 deficiency in ILC2s spontaneously triggers the circuit and, unexpectedly, promotes adaptive small-intestinal lengthening and remodeling. Circuit activation occurs upon weaning and is enabled by dietary polysaccharides that render mice permissive for Tritrichomonas , resulting in luminal accumulation of  and succinate, metabolites of the protist hydrogenosome. Tuft cells express GPR91, the succinate receptor, and dietary succinate, but not , activates ILC2s via a tuft-, TRPM5-, and IL-25-dependent pathway. Also induced by parasitic helminths, circuit activation and small intestinal remodeling impairs infestation by new helminths, consistent with the phenomenon of concomitant immunity. We describe a metabolic sensing circuit that may have evolved to facilitate mutualistic responses to luminal pathosymbionts.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p></html>
