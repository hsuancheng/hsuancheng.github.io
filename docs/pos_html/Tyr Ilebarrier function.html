Combination of 7 and NOP ligands (e.g., H-Arg---Arg--Lys-NH2) led to binding affinities in the low nanomolar domain. In vitro, the hybrids behaved as agonists at the opioid receptors and antagonists at the nociceptin receptor. Intravenous administration of hybrid 13a (H-Dmt-d-Arg-Aba-β-Ala-Arg---Arg--Lys-NH2) to mice resulted in potent and long lasting antinociception in the tail-flick test, indicating that 13a was able to permeate the BBB. This was further supported by a cell-based BBB model. All hybrids alleviated allodynia and hyperalgesia in neuropathic pain models. Especially with respect to hyperalgesia, they showed to be more effective than the parent compounds. Hybrid 13a did not result in significant respiratory depression, in contrast to an equipotent analgesic dose of morphine. These hybrids hence represent a promising avenue toward analgesics for the dual treatment of acute and neuropathic pain.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27624080>LAT1 activity of carboxylic acid bioisosteres: Evaluation of hydroxamic acids as substrates.</a></h1><p>Large neutral amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is a solute carrier protein located primarily in the blood-brain  (BBB) that offers the potential to deliver drugs to the brain. It is also up-regulated in cancer cells, as part of a tumor's increased metabolic demands. Previously, amino acid prodrugs have been shown to be transported by LAT1. Carboxylic acid bioisosteres may afford prodrugs with an altered physicochemical and pharmacokinetic profile than those derived from natural amino acids, allowing for higher brain or tumor levels of drug and/or lower toxicity. The effect of replacing phenylalanine's carboxylic acid with a tetrazole, acylsulfonamide and hydroxamic acid (HA) bioisostere was examined. Compounds were tested for their ability to be LAT1 substrates using both cis-inhibition and trans-stimulation cell assays. As HA-Phe demonstrated weak substrate activity, its structure-activity relationship (SAR) was further explored by synthesis and testing of HA derivatives of other LAT1 amino acid substrates (i.e., , Leu, , and Met). The potential for a false positive in the trans-stimulation assay caused by parent amino acid was evaluated by conducting compound stability experiments for both HA-Leu and the corresponding methyl ester derivative. We concluded that HA's are transported by LAT1. In addition, our results lend support to a recent account that amino acid esters are LAT1 substrates, and that hydrogen bonding may be as important as charge for interaction with the transporter binding site.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

There are an estimated 5 million diagnosed AD patients in the U.S. and 16 million worldwide with no adequate treatment presently available. New therapeutic approaches are needed to slow, and hopefully reverse, disease progression. This review summarizes available information regarding an overlooked therapeutic target that may offer a treatment to slow and hopefully halt AD, namely the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met receptor system. Activation of the c-Met receptor stimulates mitogenesis, motogenesis, morphogenesis, the ability to mediate stem cell differentiation and neurogenesis, and protects against tissue insults in a wide range of cells including neurons. This growth factor system has recently been shown to induce dendritic arborization and synaptogenesis when stimulated by a newly developed angiotensin-based analogue, N-hexanoic---(6) amino hexanoic amide (Dihexa). This small molecule was derived from the pre-prototype molecule Nle1-angiotensin IV and has shown promise in facilitating the formation of new functional synaptic connections and augmenting memory consolidation in animal models of AD. Dihexa is a first-in-class compound that is orally active, penetrates the blood-brain , and facilitates memory consolidation and retrieval. This angiotensin-based small molecule may be efficacious as a treatment for AD.</p></html>
