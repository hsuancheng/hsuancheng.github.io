Here we report that genetic ablation of the corpus allatum cells of the Drosophila ring gland (the JH source) resulted in JH deficiency, pupal lethality and precocious and enhanced programmed cell death (PCD) of the larval  body. In the  body of the JH-deficient animals, Dronc and Drice, two caspase genes that are crucial for PCD induced by the molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), were significantly upregulated. These results demonstrated that JH antagonizes 20E-induced PCD by restricting the mRNA levels of Dronc and Drice. The antagonizing effect of JH on 20E-induced PCD in the  body was further confirmed in the JH-deficient animals by 20E treatment and RNA interference of the 20E receptor EcR. Moreover, MET and GCE, the bHLH-PAS transcription factors involved in JH action, were shown to induce PCD by upregulating Dronc and Drice. In the Met- and gce-deficient animals, Dronc and Drice were downregulated, whereas in the Met-overexpression  body, Dronc and Drice were significantly upregulated leading to precocious and enhanced PCD, and this upregulation could be suppressed by application of the JH agonist . For the first time, we demonstrate that JH counteracts MET and GCE to prevent caspase-dependent PCD in controlling  body remodeling and larval-pupal metamorphosis in Drosophila.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25315858>Cytochrome P450s from the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda): responses to plant allelochemicals and pesticides.</a></h1><p>Spodoptera frugiperda is a polyphagous lepidopteran pest that encounters a wide range of toxic plant metabolites in its diet. The ability of this insect to adapt to its chemical environment might be explained by the action of major detoxification enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (or CYP). Forty-two sequences coding for P450s were identified and most of the transcripts were found to be expressed in the midgut, Malpighian tubules and fat body of S. frugiperda larvae. Relatively few P450s were expressed in the established cell line Sf9. In order to gain information on how these genes respond to different chemical compounds, larvae and Sf9 cells were exposed to plant secondary metabolites (indole, indole-3-carbinol, quercetin, 2-tridecanone and xanthotoxin), insecticides (deltamethrin, fipronil, , methoxyfenozide) or model inducers (clofibrate and phenobarbital). Several genes were induced by plant chemicals such as P450s from the 6B, 321A and 9A subfamilies. Only a few genes responded to insecticides, belonging principally to the CYP9A family. There was little overlap between the response in vivo measured in the midgut and the response in vitro in Sf9 cells. In addition, regulatory elements were detected in the promoter region of these genes. In conclusion, several P450s were identified that could potentially be involved in the adaptation of S. frugiperda to its chemical environment.© 2014 The Royal Entomological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23295246>Identification and characterization of two peptidoglycan recognition proteins with zinc-dependent antibacterial activity from the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera.</a></h1><p>Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) specifically bind to peptidoglycan and play an important role in the innate immune responses as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Here we identified and characterized two PGRPs (HaPGRP-B and HaPGRP-C) from the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera. The comparative analysis indicated that five amino acids which are required for T7 lysozyme Zn(2+) binding and amidase activity are conserved in HaPGRP-B and HaPGRP-C, suggesting that the two PGRPs are members of the amidase-type PGRPs. HaPGRP-B and HaPGRP-C mRNA increased in both the  bodies and the hemocytes after an injection of Gram-negative Escherichia coli or Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. Recombinant HaPGRP-B and HaPGRP-C could agglutinate E. coli and S. aureus in a zinc-dependent manner. More importantly, both rHaPGRP-B and rHaPGRP strongly inhibited the growth of E. coli and S. aureus in the presence of Zn(2+). Moreover, the HaPGRP-B mRNA showed up-regulation post hormones (20E and ) injection. Our results indicate that the two PGRPs of H. armigera may play an important role in defending against bacteria as amidase-type PGRPs and the hormones can function in regulating the expressions of PGRPs.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the role of Tai isoforms in transducing vitellogenic signal of JH has not been determined. In this study, we show that the migratory locust Locusta migratoria has two Tai isoforms, which differ in an INDEL-1 domain with the PRD-repeat motif rich in histidine and proline at the C-terminus. Tai-A with the INDEL-1 is expressed at levels about 50-fold higher than Tai-B without the INDEL-1 in the fat body of vitellogenic adult females. Knockdown of Tai-A but not Tai-B results in a substantial reduction of vitellogenin expression in the fat body accompanied by the arrest of ovarian development and oocyte maturation, similar to that caused by depletion of both Tai isoforms. Either Tai-A or Tai-B combined with Met can induce target gene transcription in response to JH, but Tai-A appears to mediate a significantly higher transactivation. Our data suggest that the INDEL-1 domain plays a critical role in Tai function during reproduction as Tai-A appears be more active than Tai-B in transducing the vitellogenic JH signal in L. migratoria.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In Locusta migratoria, the partially palindromic 15-nt sequence, GAGGTTCGAG(A)/(T)CCT(T)/(C), found upstream of a JH-induced gene, jhp21, was designated as a putative juvenile hormone response element (JHRE). When JH-deprived adult female locusts were treated with the active JH analog, , a  body nuclear factor that bound specifically to JHRE appeared after 24 h. Binding exhibited a preference for an inverted repeat with GAGGTTC in the left half-site, a single nucleotide spacer, and a right half-site in which some variation is acceptable. Binding to JHRE was abolished by phosphorylation catalyzed by a C-type protein kinase present in the nuclear extracts. The DNA-binding protein is thus believed to be a transcription factor, which is brought to an active state through the action of JH and then participates in the regulation of certain JH-dependent genes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19469806>The impacts of classical insect hormones on the expression profiles of a new digestive trypsin-like protease (TLP) from the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera.</a></h1><p>Trypsin proteinases perform important roles in the protein digestion of an insect midgut. A 1042 bp full-length cDNA was cloned from Helicoverpa armigera. The gene encoded a 32 kDa protein, with a predicted isoelectric point of 5.7. The amino acid sequence of the protein had a trypsin-like serine protease domain, and the gene was named Ha-TLP. The expression of the gene was tissue-specific and the transcript of Ha-TLP existed only in the midgut and was not found in the head-thorax, integument,  body and haemocytes from 5th instar larvae, with similar expression levels between those in feeding larvae and in molting larvae. In the midgut, the gene transcription level declined from 6th instar 72 h after the larvae entered the wandering stage, and disappeared from 6th instar at 96 h until the pupal stage. By immunohistochemistry, Ha-TLP was detected in the cytoplasm of the midgut epithelial cells of the 6th instar feeding stage worms. The expression of Ha-TLP could be up-regulated by a juvenile hormone (JH) analog  and down-regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). These facts indicate that Ha-TLP was involved in food digestion during larval growth and probably up-regulated by JH and suppressed by extra 20E in vivo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22143427>The steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone upregulated the protein phosphatase 6 for the programmed cell death in the insect midgut.</a></h1><p>Programmed cell death (PCD) plays an important role in insect midgut remodeling during metamorphosis. Insect midgut PCD is triggered by the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and it is mediated by a series of genes. However, the mechanism by which 20E triggers midgut PCD is still unclear. Here, we report a protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) from Helicoverpa armigera playing roles in midgut PCD. PP6 was expressed in the midgut during larval growth and it is significantly increased during metamorphosis. The increase was proven to be regulated by 20E. The juvenile hormone analog  has no effect on PP6 expression. RNA interference analysis suggests that 20E upregulated the PP6 transcript levels through the ecdysone receptor EcRB1. PP6 knockdown by larval feeding or PP6 dsRNA injection resulted in the repression of the midgut PCD during the metamorphic stage. The mechanism was demonstrated to be through the suppression of genes such as Broad (Br), E74a, E75b, HR3, E93, rpr, and caspase, which are involved in 20E signaling pathway or midgut PCD. These findings suggest that PP6 is involved in the 20E signal transduction pathway and participates in the PCD in midgut.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27979731>Nucleoporin Nup358 facilitates nuclear import of -tolerant (Met) in an importin β- and Hsp83-dependent manner.</a></h1><p>The bHLH-PAS transcription factor, -tolerant (Met), functions as a juvenile hormone (JH) receptor and transduces JH signals by directly binding to E-box like motifs in the regulatory regions of JH response genes. Nuclear localization of Met is crucial for its transcriptional activity. Our previous studies have shown that the chaperone protein Hsp83 facilitates JH-induced Met nuclear import in Drosophila melanogaster. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of Met nuclear transport are not fully elucidated. Using DNA affinity chromatography, we have previously detected binding of the nucleoporin Nup358, in the presence of JH, to the JH response region (JHRR) sequences isolated from the Krüppel-homolog 1 (Kr-h1) promoter. Here, we have demonstrated that Nup358 regulates JH-Hsp83-induced Met nuclear localization. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Nup358 expression in Drosophila fat body perturbs Met nuclear transport during the 3 h after initiation of wandering, when the JH titer is high. The accompanying reduced expression of the transport receptor importin β in Nup358 RNAi flies could be one of the reasons accounting for Met mislocalization. Furthermore, a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain at the N-terminal end of Nup358 interacts with Hsp83 and is indispensable for Met nuclear localization. Overexpression of the TPR domain in Drosophila fat body prevents Met nuclear localization resulting in a decrease in JHRR-driven reporter activity and Kr-h1 expression. These data show that Nup358 facilitates JH-induced Met nuclear transport in a manner dependent on importin β and Hsp83.Copyright © 2016.

Both proteins potentially mediate the effect of juvenile hormone (JH) as candidate JH receptors. Here we report that Met and Gce are partially redundant in transducing JH action. Both Met and gce null single mutants are fully viable, but the Met gce double mutant, Met(27) gce(2.5k), dies during the larval-pupal transition. Precocious and enhanced caspase-dependent programmed cell death (PCD) appears in  body cells of Met(27) gce(2.5k) during the early larval stages. Expression of Kr-h1, a JH response gene that inhibits 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E)-induced broad (br) expression, is abolished in Met(27) gce(2.5k) during larval molts. Consequently, expression of br occurs precociously in Met(27) gce(2.5k), which may cause precocious caspase-dependent PCD during the early larval stages. Defective phenotypes and gene expression changes in Met(27) gce(2.5k) double mutants are similar to those found in JH-deficient animals. Importantly, exogenous application of JH agonists rescued the JH-deficient animals but not the Met(27) gce(2.5k) mutants. Our data suggest a model in which Drosophila Met and Gce redundantly transduce JH action to prevent 20E-induced caspase-dependent PCD during larval molts by induction of Kr-h1 expression and inhibition of br expression.Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The cDNA for SP-2 (2572 bp) codes for a 747-residue protein with a predicted molecular mass of 88.5 kDa. The calculated isoelectric point is 7.6. Multiple alignment analysis of amino acid sequence revealed that SP-2 is most similar to BJHSP2 (74.3% identity). According to both the phylogenetic analyses and criteria for amino acid composition, SP-2 belongs to the subfamily of moderately methionine-rich storage proteins (3.2% methionine, 11.8% aromatic amino acid). Topical application of the JH analog, , after head ligation of larvae, suppressed transcription of the SP-2 gene, indicating hormonal effects at the transcriptional level. The SP-2 transcript was detected by Northern blot analysis in Malpighian tubules, in addition to the  body where it was most abundant. The local expression of SP-2 in Malpighian tubules suggests that it may have some function in that organ.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10600643>Both retinoic-acid-receptor- and retinoid-X-receptor-dependent signalling pathways mediate the induction of the brown-adipose-tissue-uncoupling-protein-1 gene by retinoids.</a></h1><p>The intracellular pathways and receptors mediating the effects of retinoic acid (RA) on the brown--uncoupling-protein-1 gene (ucp-1) have been analysed. RA activates transcription of ucp-1 and the RA receptor (RAR) is known to be involved in this effect. However, co-transfection of an expression vector for retinoid-X receptor (RXR) increases the action of 9-cis RA but not the effects of all-trans RA on the ucp-1 promoter in brown adipocytes. Either RAR-specific ¿p-[(E)-2-(5,6,7,8,-tetrahydro-5,5,8, 8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propenyl]benzoic acid¿ or RXR-specific [isopropyl-(E,E)-(R,S)-11-methoxy-3,7, 11-trimethyldodeca-2,4-dienoate, or ] synthetic compounds increase the expression of UCP-1 mRNA and the activity of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression vectors driven by the ucp-1 promoter. The RXR-mediated action of 9-cis RA requires the upstream enhancer region at -2469/-2318 in ucp-1. During brown-adipocyte differentiation RXRalpha and RXRgamma mRNA expression is induced in parallel with UCP-1 mRNA, whereas the mRNA for the three RAR subtypes, alpha, beta and gamma, decreases. Co-transfection of murine expression vectors for the different RAR and RXR subtypes indicates that RARalpha and RARbeta as well as RXRalpha are the major retinoid-receptor subtypes capable of mediating the responsiveness of ucp-1 to retinoids. It is concluded that the effects of retinoids on ucp-1 transcription involve both RAR- and RXR-dependent signalling pathways. The responsiveness of brown adipose tissue to retinoids in vivo relies on a complex combination of the capacity of RAR and RXR subtypes to mediate ucp-1 induction and their distinct expression in the differentiated brown adipocyte.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26728459>Juvenile Hormone Activates the Transcription of Cell-division-cycle 6 (Cdc6) for Polyploidy-dependent Insect Vitellogenesis and Oogenesis.</a></h1><p>Although juvenile hormone (JH) is known to prevent insect larval metamorphosis and stimulate adult reproduction, the molecular mechanisms of JH action in insect reproduction remain largely unknown. Earlier, we reported that the JH-receptor complex, composed of -tolerant and steroid receptor co-activator, acts on mini-chromosome maintenance (Mcm) genes Mcm4 and Mcm7 to promote DNA replication and polyploidy for the massive vitellogenin (Vg) synthesis required for egg production in the migratory locust (Guo, W., Wu, Z., Song, J., Jiang, F., Wang, Z., Deng, S., Walker, V. K., and Zhou, S. (2014) PLoS Genet. 10, e1004702). In this study we have investigated the involvement of cell-division-cycle 6 (Cdc6) in JH-dependent vitellogenesis and oogenesis, as Cdc6 is essential for the formation of prereplication complex. We demonstrate here that Cdc6 is expressed in response to JH and -tolerant, and Cdc6 transcription is directly regulated by the JH-receptor complex. Knockdown of Cdc6 inhibits polyploidization of fat body and follicle cells, resulting in the substantial reduction of Vg expression in the fat body as well as severely impaired oocyte maturation and ovarian growth. Our data indicate the involvement of Cdc6 in JH pathway and a pivotal role of Cdc6 in JH-mediated polyploidization, vitellogenesis, and oogenesis.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30789202>Dissecting the Role of Juvenile Hormone Binding Protein in Response to Hormone and Starvation in the Cotton Bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae).</a></h1><p>Juvenile hormone (JH) regulates many physiological processes in insect development, diapause, and reproduction. Juvenile hormone binding protein (JHBP), the carrier partner protein of JH, is essential for the balance of JH titer to regulate the metamorphosis and development of insect. In this study, two JHBP genes were identified from Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), namely HaJHBP1 and HaJHBP2. The tissue and temporal expression pattern revealed that both HaJHBP1 and HaJHBP2 were dominantly expressed in larval fat body, and their high transcription stages were detected in fourth and fifth instars. The ingestion of , a JH analogue, significantly induced the expression of HaJHBP1 and HaJHBP2. However, both HaJHBP1 and HaJHBP2 mRNA levels were significantly downregulated after treated with a JH antagonist, precocene. When subject to starvation, larvae showed a marked suppressive effect in the expression of HaJHBP1 and HaJHBP2. These results indicate that JHBP plays a part in the JH-regulated , growth, or development in reaction to different nutritional conditions.© The Author(s) 2019.

Aside from protecting rice plants from the disease, JGM leads to the unexpected action of stimulating brown planthopper (BPH; ; Hemiptera: Delphacidae) reproduction to the extent it can influence population sizes. The JGM-induced BPH population growth has potential for severe agricultural problems and we are working to understand and mitigate the mechanisms of the enhanced reproduction. UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are multifunctional detoxification enzymes responsible for biotransformation of diverse lipophilic compounds. The biological significance of this enzyme family in insect fecundity is not fully understood, however, upregulated  in JGM-treated BPH, may influence fecundity through  of developmental hormones. This idea prompted our hypothesis that  is a positive modulator of BPH reproductive biology. JGM treatment led to significant increases in accumulations of mRNA encoding UGT12, numbers of eggs laid, oviposition period, juvenile hormone III titers, and fat body, and ovarian protein contents. dsUGT12 treatment suppressed  expression and reversed JGM-enhanced effects, resulting in under-developed ovaries and reduced expression of juvenile hormone acid methyltransferase and the JH receptor,  tolerant. Application of the JH analog, , on dsUGT12 treated-females partially reversed the dsUTG12 influence on vitellogenin synthesis and on  expression.

No posttranslational modification could be detected. Precipitation of this protein leads to formation of a product of Mr about 240 000, which fails to dissociate under treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate and beta-mercaptoethanol. In adult female locusts, synthesis and secretion of protein by the  body increases three- to four-fold from emergence until day 7 of adult life, Lp representing 15-30% of the total. In the subsequent vitellogenic stage (days 7-14 or later), a further impressive increase in protein output up to five times the previtellogenic rate is observed, followed by a decrease to the previtellogenic level at the end of the cycle. This fluctuation is mainly due to production of the yolk precursor protein, vitellogenin (Vg), which makes up some 60% of the secreted protein at the peak of the cycle. Production of Lp does not follow these dramatic changes. Inactivation of the corpora allata, the source of juvenile hormone (JH), by treatment with precocene, prevents the synthesis of Vg in females, and diminishes the production of other proteins, including Lp, in both sexes. Normal secretion patterns can be restored by application of the JH analog, . It is concluded that, whereas the synthesis of Vg is dependent upon and intensely stimulated by JH, the synthesis of Lp is stimulated only to a minor extent, in common with other proteins.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30205150>Juvenile hormone promotes locust fat body cell polyploidization and vitellogenesis by activating the transcription of Cdk6 and E2f1.</a></h1><p>Juvenile hormone (JH) is known to promote cell polyploidization for insect vitellogenesis and egg production, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using the migratory locust Locusta migratoria as a model system, we report here that the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (Cdk6) and adenovirus E2 factor-1 (E2f1), the core mediators in cell cycle progression is regulated by JH and its receptor -tolerant (Met). JH acts through its receptor complex comprised of Met and Taiman to directly activate the transcription of Cdk6 and E2f1. Depletion of Cdk6 or E2f1 results in significantly decreased ploidy, precocious mitotic entry and increased cell numbers in the fat body, accompanied by substantial reduction of Vitellogenin gene expression, blocked ovarian growth and arrested oocyte maturation. These findings indicate a crucial role of Cdk6 and E2f1 in JH-regulated polyploidization and vitellogenesis as well as a novel regulatory machinery for endocycling in insects.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

To support a role for JH in mediating the response of ovarian follicles after a blood meal, we explored three main questions: (1) Do changes in nutrition during the previtellogenic resting stage lead to relevant biochemical and molecular changes in the previtellogenic ovary? (2) Do hormonal manipulations during the previtellogenic resting stage lead to the same biochemical and molecular changes? (3) Does nutrition and hormones during the previtellogenic resting stage affect vitellogenic resorption and reproductive output? We examined the accumulation of neutral lipids in the previtellogenic ovary as well as the previtellogenic expression of genes integral to endocytosis and oocyte development such as the: vitellogenin receptor (AaVgR), lipophorin receptor (AaLpRov), heavy-chain clathrin (AaCHC), and ribosomal protein L32 (rpL32) under various previtellogenic nutritional and hormonal conditions. mRNA abundance and neutral  content increased within the previtellogenic ovary as previtellogenic mosquitoes were offered increasing sucrose concentrations.  application mimicked the effect of offering the highest sucrose concentrations on mRNA abundance and  accumulation in the previtellogenic ovary. These same nutritional and hormonal manipulations altered the extent of vitellogenic resorption. Mosquitoes offered 20% sucrose during the previtellogenic resting stage had nearly 3 times less vitellogenic resorption than mosquitoes offered 3% sucrose despite taking smaller blood meals and developed ∼10% more eggs during the first gonotrophic cycle. Mosquitoes treated with JH III during the previtellogenic resting stage and then offered a blood meal had a ∼40% reduction in the amount of vitellogenic resorption and developed ∼12% more eggs. Taken together, these results suggest that previtellogenic nutrition alters the extent and pattern of resorption after a blood meal through the effect of JH on mRNA abundance and  accumulation in previtellogenic follicles.Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21930132>Influence of  and temperature on diapause termination in adult females of the over-wintering solitary bee, Osmia rufa L.</a></h1><p>Females of Osmia rufa, as most species in this genus, enter an obligatory diapause, overwintering as an imago inside a cocoon until the ensuing spring when after emergence - mating, egg development and oviposition occur. Diapause in this species is initiated in November, undergoes 2 months of a pre-wintering period that is terminated at the end of January, after 1 month of maintenance. In this study, factors that affect the termination of adult diapause in the female of this species were investigated. The experimental material consisted of bees that were brought from nests kept in natural conditions 1 month prior to natural termination of diapause. Three different experimental treatments were planned to evaluate the potential effect of  and temperature on diapause termination. During the 5 day experimental period the first group of females was kept at 4°C, the second group at 15°C and the last group of females was kept at 20°C. All groups of females were treated with  topically at a dose of 200 μg. After  application a significant increase (p<0.001) in the size of terminal oocytes was recorded in the three experimental groups. However, no changes in the size of terminal oocytes between acetone treated and untreated control groups were observed. The number of oocytes progressively increased following topical application of  compared to non-treated or acetone treated females. In successive applications of 200 μg  gradual changes in ovary and  body protein concentration were observed. As compared to controls, protein content in ovaries isolated from -treated females increased, whereas it decreased in  body. The least differences in oocyte size and protein concentration in ovary and  body between control groups and with  application occurred at 4°C. Differences increased and were higher in females kept at 20°C and increased rapidly after  application. Exposure to increasing temperature regimes accelerated the juvenile hormone (JH) induced termination of diapause. Taken together, our results indicate that temperature may play an important role in termination of diapause in O. rufa, but its role is secondary to that played by JH.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Trypsin fragments from each protein band were sequenced, used to design degenerate primers to amplify core cDNA fragments, which were extended by 5' and 3' RACE. All three cDNAs were closely related to insect hexamerins, had an N-terminal signal sequence, and their transcripts were found solely in the  body. Adult females fed an ad libitum diet had their highest hexamerin levels on day 18 when oocytes begin rapid growth. Hexamerin levels fell as oocytes reached their maximum length on day 30. Animals fed a restricted diet had their highest hexamerin levels on day 30 which then fell as oocytes reached their maximum length on day 36. Hexamerin mRNA levels were only modestly different for animals on the two diets, indicating that nutrition affected translation of the hexamerin mRNA. Allatectomized animals treated with juvenile hormone III (JH) or  caused the appearance of vitellogenin in the hemolymph, but had no effect on hexamerin levels.

The complete cDNA (2121bp) encodes a 706-amino acid protein with a molecular mass ~82kDa. Expression of RbHex 82 was predominant in fat body among larval tissues. Further, it is prominently expressed during the last instar larval development. Homology modeling and docking studies predicted riboflavin binding site of the hexamerin. Spectrofluorimetric analysis further confirmed riboflavin release from the hexamerin fraction. Quantitative RT-PCR studies demonstrated hormonal regulation of RbHex 82. 20-Hydroxyecdysone (20HE) had a stimulatory effect on its transcription whereas JH alone did not show any effect. However, JH in the presence of 20HE maintains the RbHex 82 expression which indicates the JH's role as a status quo factor.

The 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (Grp78) is a heat shock protein 70-kDa family member and one of the most abundant chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it helps fold newly synthesized peptides. Because of its prominent role in protein folding, and also ER stress, we hypothesized that  might be involved in fat body cell homeostasis and vitellogenesis and a regulatory target of JH. We report here that the migratory locust  possesses two  genes that are differentially regulated by JH. We found that  is regulated by JH through Mcm4/7-dependent DNA replication and polyploidization, whereas  expression is directly activated by the JH-receptor complex comprising -tolerant and Taiman proteins. Interestingly,  expression in the fat body is about 10-fold higher than that of  Knockdown of either  or  significantly reduced levels of vitellogenin (Vg) protein, accompanied by retarded maturation of oocytes. Depletion of both  and  resulted in ER stress and apoptosis in the fat body and in severely defective Vg synthesis and oocyte maturation. These results indicate a crucial role of Grp78 in JH-dependent vitellogenesis and egg production. The presence and differential regulation of two  genes in  likely help accelerate the production of this chaperone in the fat body to facilitate folding of massively synthesized Vg and other proteins.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6832479>Juvenile hormone-dependent vitellogenin synthesis in Locusta migratoria  body: inducibility related to sex and stage.</a></h1><p>Juvenile hormone (JH)-dependent vitellogenin (Vg) synthesis in the  body of Locusta migratoria is normally limited to sexually mature adult females. As a step toward examining the basis of this limitation, we have tested female and male locusts in a series of stages after the third larval molt for inducibility of Vg synthesis by the synthetic JH analog, . We find that in the fourth and fifth larval instars  body of both sexes can be induced to produce Vg, but in the adult stage females respond strongly while no more than trace amounts can be induced in males. Quantitative assays show relative responsiveness in the order: adult female greater than fifth instar female greater than fifth instar male much greater than adult male. During the fifth instar of both sexes, maximal vitellogenic response was obtained in midinstar. After the larval-adult ecdysis, female  body was unresponsive during the first 4 days, then responsiveness increased and by Day 8 after ecdysis  bodies were fully as competent to produce Vg as at Day 14, the usual maximum of the first vitellogenic cycle due to endogenous JH. Larval and adult female  bodies implanted into male larvae are competent for Vg synthesis after metamorphosis, so that the differences between adult male and female cannot be imposed by the male milieu intérieur during the larval-adult molt. In male and female precocious adults, produced by treatment of fourth instars with precocene,  body responded to  as in normal adults. We conclude that factors intrinsic to the  body cells, determined early in development, are responsible for differential gene programing in males and females, which is partially expressed by the fifth instar but fully manifest only after a molt in the absence of JH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14754907>Induction of lysosomal phospholipase A2 through the retinoid X receptor in THP-1 cells.</a></h1><p>An acidic phospholipase A(2) (LPLA(2)) was recently purified and cloned. THP-1 cells were used to characterize the gene induction of LPLA(2). THP-1 cells were stimulated with several differentiation agents. The LPLA(2) mRNA and activity increased in cells treated with phorbol ester but not with vitamin D3, interferon-gamma, or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. All-trans-retinoic acid enhanced mRNA expression and enzyme activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The natural 9-cis and 13-cis isomers of retinoic acid enhanced transcription and activity. Two classes of nuclear receptors, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and the retinoid X receptor (RXR), mediate retinoic acid signaling. Specific RAR and RXR agonists were used to identify the nuclear receptor responsible for LPLA(2) induction by retinoic acid. Treatment with the RAR agonist 4-[E-2-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetra-methyl-2-naphthalenyl]1-propenyl benzoic acid (TTNPB) resulted in a small and statistically significant increase of the mRNA expression and activity of LPLA(2). The RXR agonist  acid worked as well as all-trans-retinoic acid at increasing both mRNA and enzyme activity. The  acid and TTNPB effects were not synergistic. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) and troglitazone failed to induce LPLA(2) activity and mRNA. Thus, an RXR-dependent pathway controls LPLA(2) gene activation by retinoic acid in THP-1 cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24361539>Juvenile hormone signaling during reproduction and development of the linden bug, Pyrrhocoris apterus.</a></h1><p>Juvenile hormone (JH), a sesquiterpenoid produced by the insect corpus allatum gland (CA), prevents metamorphosis in larvae and stimulates vitellogenesis in adult females. Whether the same JH signaling pathway regulates both processes is presently unknown. Here, we employ the robust JH response during reproduction and development of the linden bug, Pyrrhocoris apterus, to compare the function of key JH-signaling genes encoding the JH receptor, -tolerant (Met), its binding partner Taiman (Tai), and a JH-inducible protein, Krüppel-homolog 1 (Kr-h1). RNA interference (RNAi) with Met or Tai, but not Kr-h1, blocked ovarian development and suppressed vitellogenin gene expression in the  body of females raised under reproduction-inducing conditions. Loss of Met and Tai matched the effects of CA ablation or the natural absence of JH during reproductive diapause. Stimulation of vitellogenesis by treatment of diapausing females with a JH mimic  also required both Met and Tai in the  body, whereas Kr-h1 RNAi had no effect. Therefore, the Met-Tai complex likely functions as a JH receptor during vitellogenesis. In contrast to Met and Kr-h1 that are both required for JH to prevent precocious metamorphosis in P. apterus larvae, removal of Tai disrupted larval ecdysis without causing premature adult development. Our results show that while Met operates during metamorphosis in larvae and reproduction in adult females, its partner Tai is only required for the latter. The diverse functions of JH thus likely rely on a common receptor whose actions are modulated by distinct components.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In turn, JH levels have been correlated with sex-specific differences in locomotor activity. Here, the involvement of the insulin signaling pathway in sex-specific differences in locomotor activity was investigated in Drosophila. Ablation of insulin-producing neurons in the adult pars-intercerebralis was found to increase trehalosemia and to abolish sexual dimorphism relevant to locomotion. Conversely, hyper-insulinemia induced by insulin injection or by over-expression of an insulin-like peptide decreases trehalosemia but does not affect locomotive behavior. Moreover, we also show that in the head of adult flies, the insulin receptor (InR) is expressed only in the  body surrounding the brain. While both male and female InR mutants are hyper-trehalosemic, they exhibit similar patterns of locomotor activity. Our results indicate that first, insulin controls trehalosemia in adults, and second, like JH, it controls sex-specific differences in the locomotor activity of adult Drosophila in a manner independent of its effect on trehalose .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302406>Effects of two juvenile hormone analogue insecticides, fenoxycarb and , on Neocaridina davidi.</a></h1><p>Juvenile hormone analogue (JHA) insecticides are endocrine disrupters that interfere with hormonal action in insects by mimicking their juvenile hormones (JH). As the structure and functions of methyl farnesoate in crustaceans are similar to those of JH in insects, exogenous JHA insecticides could have adverse effects on the development and reproduction of crustaceans. This study examined the toxic effects of two JHA insecticides, fenoxycarb and , on a freshwater shrimp model of cherry shrimp, Neocaridina davidi. Both insecticides had detrimental effects on cherry shrimp, but fenoxycarb was more toxic than . Chronic exposure to these insecticides reduced the shrimp's body length and molting frequency. Based on transcriptome annotations for N. davidi, we identified important gene homologues that were active in both insect JH biosynthetic and degradative  as well as JH and ecdysteroid signaling . Chronic treatments with JHAs had significant effects on these genes in N. davidi. Our transcriptomic analysis showed that genes involved in the  related to cuticle development, serine protease activity, and carbohydrate, peptide and lipid  processes were differentially expressed in shrimp exposed to JHAs. These results demonstrate the toxicity of fenoxycarb and  to freshwater crustaceans and indicate the need to monitor the use of JHA insecticides.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Previously we have demonstrated that larval growth period influences the effect of insulin on the accumulation of glycogen in the fat body of Bombyx larvae. In the present study we demonstrate that Bombyx larvae at the terminal growth period (TGP, after critical weight) had a significantly greater increase in the expression level of Akt in the fat body than at the active growth period (AGP, before critical weight). The larvae at TGP also showed an increase in the expression level of ecdysone receptors (EcRB1 and USP1) and ecdysone-induced early genes (E75A and broad). The treatment of bovine insulin and  to larvae at AGP induced the transcript levels of Akt, irrespective of the nutritional status of the larvae. However, in larvae at TGP, insulin repressed the transcript level of Akt. On contrary, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) induced the expression level of Akt in TGP larvae, but at feeding only. Insulin and 20E thus showed an antagonistic action on the Akt expression level in TGP larvae under feeding. The studies thus showed that larval growth period influences the expression level of Akt and ecdysone receptors in Bombyx. Further, the growth period and nutrition modulate the effect of exogenous hormones on Akt expression.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The corresponding cDNA has been cloned (lambda 21) and a 718-base pair sequence determined. It encodes a 196-amino acid polypeptide, including a signal peptide. An NH2-terminal sequence has 24 out of 28 amino acids identical with those of a previously described 19K locust hemolymph protein, but the remainder of the sequence shows no similarity. From adult female hemolymph, a 21-kDa protein, designated 21K protein, has been purified, with an NH2-terminal sequence exactly matching that deduced from clone lambda 21. This 21K protein is found only in the adult female, is dependent on induction by JH, and is assumed to represent the product of the lambda 21 gene. It shows no immunochemical cross-reaction with locust 19K protein, apolipophorin III, nor with vitellogenin (Vg). Its isoelectric point is pH 5.4; it contains some carbohydrate. 21K protein is synthesized in adult female  body, accumulates in hemolymph, and is taken up into the developing oocytes in parallel with Vg. In locusts deprived of JH with precocene, production of 21K protein and of lambda 21-hybridizing transcripts is induced by the JH analog, , in parallel with Vg and its mRNA. Because of its sex-, stage-, and JH-dependent regulation, coordinate with Vg, the 21K protein will be valuable for analysis of gene expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2105312>Evidence for a juvenile hormone receptor involved in protein synthesis in Drosophila melanogaster.</a></h1><p>The larval  body of newly eclosed adults of Drosophila melanogaster was found to contain a single major binding protein specific for juvenile hormone (JH). Binding to this protein was saturable, of high affinity, and specific for JH III. The protein has a subunit molecular weight (Mr) of 85,000, as determined by photoaffinity labeling. The same or similar JH-binding protein was found in larval  body and cuticle of third instar larvae and in male accessory glands and heads of newly eclosed adults. It was not found in several other tissues in adults. Male accessory gland cytosol from wild-type flies was found to contain a single binder with a dissociation constant (KD) of 6.7 nM for JH III; a binder in similar preparations from the -tolerant (Met) mutant had a KD value 6-fold higher. JH III stimulated protein synthesis in glands cultured in vitro, but this effect was reduced in Met flies as compared to wild-type flies, establishing a correlation between JH binding and biological activity of the hormone. In addition, glandular protein accumulation during the first 2 days of adult development was less in Met flies than in wild-type flies. These results strongly suggest that the binding protein we have identified mediates this JH effect in male accessory glands and thus is acting as a JH receptor.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23012454>bHLH-PAS heterodimer of -tolerant and Cycle mediates circadian expression of juvenile hormone-induced mosquito genes.</a></h1><p>Juvenile hormone (JH) governs a great diversity of processes in insect development and reproduction. It plays a critical role in controlling the gonadotrophic cycles of female mosquitoes by preparing tissues for blood digestion and egg development. Here, we show that in female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes JH III control of gene expression is mediated by a heterodimer of two bHLH-PAS proteins-the JH receptor -tolerant (MET) and Cycle (CYC, AAEL002049). We identified Aedes CYC as a MET-interacting protein using yeast two-hybrid screening. Binding of CYC and MET required the presence of JH III. In newly eclosed female mosquitoes, the expression of two JH-responsive genes, Kr-h1 and Hairy, was dependent on both the ratio of light to dark periods and JH III. Their expression was compromised by in vivo RNA interference (RNAi) depletions of CYC, MET, and the steroid receptor coactivator SRC/FISC. Moreover, JH III was not effective in induction of Kr-h1 and Hairy gene expression in vitro in  bodies of female mosquitoes with RNAi-depleted CYC, MET or SRC/FISC. A sequence containing an E-box-like motif from the Aedes Kr-h1 gene promoter specifically interacted with a protein complex, which included MET and CYC from the female mosquito  body nuclear extract. These results indicate that a MET/CYC heterodimer mediates JH III activation of Kr-h1 and Hairy genes in the context of light-dependent circadian regulation in female mosquitoes during posteclosion development. This study provides an important insight into the understanding of the molecular basis of JH action.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22940452>takeout-dependent longevity is associated with altered Juvenile Hormone signaling.</a></h1><p>In order to understand the molecular mechanisms of longevity regulation, we recently performed a screen designed to enrich for genes common to several longevity interventions. Using this approach, we identified the Drosophila melanogaster gene takeout. takeout is upregulated in a variety of long-lived flies, and extends life span when overexpressed. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of takeout-dependent longevity. takeout overexpression specifically in the  body is sufficient to increase fly longevity and is additive to the longevity effects of Dietary Restriction. takeout long-lived flies do not show phenotypes often associated with increased longevity, such as enhanced stress resistance or major metabolic abnormalities. However, males exhibit greatly diminished courtship behavior, leading to a reduction in fertility. Interestingly, takeout contains a binding domain for Juvenile Hormone, a fly hormone that plays a role in the regulation of developmental transitions. Importantly, the longevity and courtship phenotypes of takeout overexpressing flies are reversed by treatment with the Juvenile Hormone analog . These data suggest that takeout is a key player in the tradeoff-switch between fertility and longevity. takeout may control fertility via modulation of courtship behavior. This regulation may occur through Juvenile Hormone binding to takeout and a subsequent reduction in Juvenile Hormone signaling activity.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The objective of the present laboratory study was to investigate the effect of  application and diet supplementation with hydrolyzed yeast (protein) on the turnover of body lipids and protein to confirm the feasibility of their application in melon fly SIT mass-rearing programmes. While females had access to a diet that included hydrolyzed yeast (protein), males were exposed to one of the following treatments: (1) topical application of  and access to diet including protein (M+P+); (2) only diet including protein (M-P+); (3) only  (M+P-) and (4) untreated, only sugar-fed, control males (M-P-). Total body carbon (TBC) and total body nitrogen (TBN) of flies were measured at regular intervals from emergence to 35 days of age for each of the different treatments. Nitrogen assimilation and turnover in the flies were measured using stable isotope ((15)N) dilution techniques. Hydrolyzed yeast incorporation into the diet significantly increased male body weight, TBC and TBN as compared to sugar-fed males. Females had significantly higher body weight, TBC and TBN as compared to all males. TBC and TBN showed age-dependent changes, increasing until the age of sexual maturity and decreasing afterwards in both sexes.  treatment did not significantly affect TBC or TBN. The progressive increase with age of TBC suggests that lipogenesis occurs in adult male B. cucurbitae, as is the case in other tephritids. Stable isotope dilution was shown to be an effective method for determining N uptake in B. cucurbitae. This technique was used to show that sugar-fed males rely solely on larval N reserves and that the N uptake rate in males with access to diet including hydrolyzed yeast was higher shortly after emergence and then stabilized. The implications of the results for SIT applications are discussed.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we report that the takeout gene is an essential component of nutritional homeostasis in Drosophila. takeout encodes a putative juvenile hormone (JH) binding protein and has been described as a link between circadian rhythm and feeding behaviour. However, the physiological role of takeout and its putative link to JH remain unknown. In this study, we show that takeout (to(1)) flies failed to adapt their food intake according to food availability and that most defects could be genetically rescued. When food is abundant, to(1) are hyperphagic, yielding to hypertrophy of the  body. When food reappears after a starvation period, to(1) flies do not increase their food intake as much as wild-type flies. This defect in food intake regulation is partly based on the action of Takeout on taste neurons, because the sensitivity of to(1) gustatory neurons to sugars does not increase after starvation, as in wild-type neurons. This lack of regulation is also evident at the locomotor activity, which normally increases during starvation, a behaviour related to food foraging. In addition, to(1) flies lack sexual dimorphism of locomotor activity, which has previously been linked to the JH circulating level. Moreover, application of the JH analog  rescues the phenotype. These results suggest that takeout plays a central role as a feeding regulator and may act by modulating the circulating JH level.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26927076>Nutritional Signaling Regulates Vitellogenin Synthesis and Egg Development through Juvenile Hormone in Nilaparvata lugens (Stål).</a></h1><p>Insect female reproduction which comprises the synthesis of vitellogenein (Vg) in the fat body and its incorporation into developing oocytes, needs a large amount of  and food resources. Our previous studies found that juvenile hormone (JH) regulates vitellogenesis in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens. Here, we report on the role of JH in nutrient-regulated Vg synthesis and egg development. We first cloned the genes coding for juvenile hormone acid methyltransferase (JHAMT) which is involved in JH biosynthesis and -tolerant (Met) for JH action. Amino acids (AAs) induced the expression of jmtN, while showing no effects on the expression of met using an artificial diet culture system. Reduction in JH biosynthesis or its action by RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of jmtN or met led to a severe inhibition of AAs-induced Vg synthesis and oocyte maturation, together with lower fecundity. Furthermore, exogenous application of JH III partially restored Vg expression levels in jmtN RNAi females. However, JH III application did not rescue Vg synthesis in these met RNAi insects. Our results show that AAs induce Vg synthesis in the fat body and egg development in concert with JH biosynthesis in Nilaparvata lugens (Stål), rather than through JH action.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6207067>Regulation of hemoglobin synthesis by ecdysterone and juvenile hormone during development of Chironomus thummi (Diptera).</a></h1><p>Chironomus thummi contains nine soluble hemoglobins (Hbs) in the larval hemolymph which can be resolved by 12.7% acrylamide gel electrophoresis (pH 8.65). Hemoglobins 2 and 3 are stage specific for the 4th instar and are first detected by day 4 of this stage in vivo, being absent in the 3rd instar. -body cultures in the presence of 3H-delta-aminolevulinic acid and 14C-amino acids synthesize and secrete labelled Hbs, as was assayed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoprecipitation of Hbs recovered from the culture medium. During development from 3rd instar to pupa, Chironomus  body undergoes functional changes, being actively involved in Hb synthesis in intermolt periods and inactive with respect to Hb production during molting. The repression of Hb synthesis is reversed following the molt from the 3rd instar to the 4th instar. Metamorphosis is related to a gradual and irreversible loss of Hb synthesis and secretion by the  body. The treatment of  body in vitro with ecdysterone inhibits Hb synthesis in tissue from intermolt animals, even in the presence of excess , a potent juvenile hormone analogue. In contrast, immunoprecipitation of the translation products from a wheat-germ cell-free system, using mRNA from ecdysterone-treated 4th-instar  body as a template, shows significant synthesis of globins, suggesting that ecdysterone does not affect the amount or template activity of globin messages.  induces the precocious in vitro synthesis of Hbs 2 and 3 in day-2 4th-instar  body and enhances all Hb synthesis in the absence of ecdysterone. In vitro treatment with  activates newly molted  body to synthesize Hbs 2 and 3 in vitro. The process of Hb induction by this analogue is completely inhibited by actinomycin D or ecdysterone.  body from animals already exposed to high endogeneous ecdysterone titer are insensitive to treatment with this juvenile hormone analogue. Intermolt larvae normally possess stable Hb mRNA molecules, because actinomycin-D administration in vitro does not affect Hb synthesis for as long as 30 h, whereas it effectively inhibits all RNA synthesis in the  body. Immunoprecipitation of globin translated in vitro from mRNA from 2-day-old 4th-instar larvae treated in vivo with  shows enhanced synthesis of globins 2 and 3, as compared to controls with no treatment. It is suggested that both juvenile hormone and ecdysterone regulate Hb synthesis in Chironomus; juvenile hormone affecting the activity of Hb genes, and ecdysterone modulating the level of Hb gene expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15095245>Effect of a juvenile hormone analogue on  in a wing-polymorphic cricket: implications for the endocrine-biochemical bases of life-history trade-offs.</a></h1><p>The wing-polymorphic cricket, Gryllus firmus, has a flight-capable morph (LW[f]: long winged with functional flight muscles) and a flightless morph (SW: short winged with reduced nonfunctional flight muscles) that differ genetically in many aspects of .

During the diapause preparation phase (DPP), diapause-destined individuals generally store large amounts of fat by regulating nutrition distribution for the  requirement during diapause maintenance and postdiapause development. Although nutritional patterns during the DPP have been investigated at physiological and biochemical levels in many insects, it remains largely unknown how nutritional metabolism is regulated during the DPP at molecular levels. We used RNA sequencing to compare gene expression profiles of adult female cabbage beetles Colaphellus bowringi during the preoviposition phase (POP) and the DPP. Most differentially expressed genes were involved in specific metabolic pathways during the DPP. Genes related to lipid and carbohydrate metabolic pathways were clearly highly expressed during the DPP, whereas genes related to protein metabolic pathways were highly expressed during the POP. Hormone challenge and RNA interference experiments revealed that juvenile hormone via its nuclear receptor -tolerant mediated the expression of genes associated with nutritional metabolism during the DPP.

Protein synthesis was measured for in vitro  bodies from animals treated with combinations of a juvenile hormone analog (JHA = ) and corpora cardiaca (CC) extracts. Ovarian protein content began to increase on Day 5 of adult life and reached its maximum at Days 20-22. Synthesis of proteins secreted by the in vitro  body increased by 12-fold between emergence and its maximum on Day 18, then declined to nearly its original level by Day 33. Synthesis of nonsecreted,  body proteins increased by 4-fold between emergence and a maximum on Day 21, then declined. CC extracts and JHA were administered to decapitated females to determine their regulative effects on  body protein synthesis. The synthesis by the  body of nonsecreted proteins was increased by both JHA and CC extracts. In contrast, synthesis of secreted proteins increased only in the presence of JHA. CC extracts, alone, had no effects on the synthesis of secreted proteins, but administration of CC extracts in combination with JHA increased the synthesis of the secreted proteins by 55% above that observed with JHA alone. SDS-PAGE of proteins secreted into the medium by the in vitro  body demonstrated that JHA stimulated the synthesis of specific polypeptides, whereas CC extracts did not affect the synthesis of specific-secreted polypeptides. These results suggest that JH regulates specific protein synthesis by the  body of B. discoidalis; neurohormones elevate the general capacity of the  body for protein synthesis and amplify the specific effects of JH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26747981>Compounds altering fat storage in Daphnia magna.</a></h1><p>The analysis of lipid disruptive effects in invertebrates is limited by our poor knowledge of the lipid  . A recent study showed that tributyltin activated the ecdysteroid, juvenile hormone and retinoic X receptor signaling , and disrupted the dynamics of neutral lipids in the crustacean Daphnia magna impairing the transfer of triacylglycerols to eggs and hence promoting their accumulation in post-spawning females. Tributyltin disruptive effects correlated with lower fitness for offspring and adults. The present study aims to addresses effects of existing compounds on storage lipids in post-spawning females and their health effects. D. magna individuals were exposed 12 chemicals that included vertebrate obesogens (tributyltin, triphenyltin, bisphenol A, nonylphenol, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate), other contaminants known to affect arthropods (pyriproxyfen, fenarimol, , emamectin benzoate and fluoxetine), as well as the natural hormones methyl farnesoate and 20-hydroxyecdysone. Reproductive effects were also assessed. Quantitative changes in storage lipids accumulated in lipid droplets were studied using Nile red staining, which showed a close relationship with whole organism levels of triacylglycerols. Ten compounds altered storage lipids in a concentration related manner enhancing (tributyltin, bisphenol A, methyl farnesoate, pyriproxyfen and 20-hydroxyecdysone) or decreasing (nonylphenol, fenarimol, emamectin benzoate,  and fluoxetine) their levels in post-spawning females.

Microarray time-course analysis revealed dynamic changes in gene expression during posteclosion (PE) development in the  body of female Aedes aegypti. Hierarchical clustering identified three major gene clusters: 1,843 early-PE (EPE) genes maximally expressed at 6 h PE, 457 mid-PE (MPE) genes at 24 h PE, and 1,815 late-PE (LPE) genes at 66 h PE. The RNAi microarray screen for the JH receptor -tolerant (Met) showed that 27% of EPE and 40% of MPE genes were up-regulated whereas 36% of LPE genes were down-regulated in the absence of this receptor. Met repression of EPE and MPE and activation of LPE genes were validated by an in vitro -body culture experiment using Met RNAi. Sequence motif analysis revealed the consensus for a 9-mer Met-binding motif, CACG(C)/TG(A)/G(T)/AG. Met-binding motif variants were overrepresented within the first 300 bases of the promoters of Met RNAi-down-regulated (LPE) genes but not in Met RNAi-up-regulated (EPE) genes.

There was a striking temporal separation of expression profiles among major functional gene groups, with carbohydrate, , and xenobiotics  belonging to the EPE and MPE clusters and transcription and translation to the LPE cluster.

In some processes, JH plays a critical role in defining the action of the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). In  mosquitoes, JH prepares newly emerged female adults to become competent to synthesize vitellogenin in response to 20E after blood ingestion. The molecular basis of this competence is still not well understood. Here, we report that JH regulates pre-mRNA splicing of the  gene, which encodes a key transcriptional regulator required for both JH- and 20E-controlled gene expression. JH stimulated the production of the Taiman isoforms A/B, while reducing the levels of the isoforms C/D, in the fat body after adult eclosion. The appearance of the A/B isoforms in maturing mosquitoes was accompanied by acquisition of the competence to respond to 20E. Depletion of the A/B isoforms, by inhibiting the alternative splicing or by isoform-specific RNA interference, considerably diminished the 20E-induced gene expression after a blood meal and substantially impaired oocyte development. In accordance with this observation, further studies indicated that in the presence of 20E, the Taiman A/B isoforms showed much stronger interactions with the 20E receptor complex than the Taiman C/D isoforms. In contrast, all four isoforms displayed similar capabilities of forming active JH receptor complexes with the -tolerant protein (Met). This study suggested that JH confers the competence to newly emerged female mosquitoes by regulating mRNA splicing to generate the Taiman isoforms that are essential for the vitellogenic 20E response.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21181720>An epidermis-specific chitin synthase CDNA in Choristoneura fumiferana: cloning, characterization, developmental and hormonal-regulated expression.</a></h1><p>Chitin synthase catalyzes chitin synthesis in the exoskeleton, tracheal system and gut during insect development.

Starvation experiments indicate that the Aedes aegypti critical weight is achieved by 24 h after the last larval-larval molt. When grown at 24 degrees C with excess food, the time between the critical weight and maximum weight (interval to cessation of growth) is about 24 h and pupation occurs about 24 h after the maximum weight is achieved. Oil Red O staining of 3rd and early 4th instars indicates that the midgut is a neutral  storage organ during this period. Coincident with the attainment of the critical weight is the depletion of stored midgut neutral . Application of  to 24 h post-molt 4th instars results in renewed midgut storage of neutral  suggesting that midgut neutral  storage is a JH dependent process. Starvation of 4th instars during the 24 h post-molt period suspends development in a fraction of the larvae, and with the resumption of feeding, development resumes. A regimen of starvation and resumption of feeding of 4th instars suggests that JH concentration decreased over a 40 h period after the resumption of feeding and maximum weight is attained about 48 h after the resumption of feeding. We hypothesize that this results in a shortening of the interval to cessation of growth. Real-time PCR experiments indicate that shortening the interval to cessation of growth compresses the time period during which increases in AHR3, AaEcR-B and AaUSP-a expression occur.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28446607>Juvenile hormone and its receptor -tolerant promote ribosomal biogenesis and vitellogenesis in the  mosquito.</a></h1><p>Juvenile hormone (JH) controls many biological activities in insects, including development, metamorphosis, and reproduction. In the  mosquito, a vector of dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and zika viruses, the  tissue (the fat body, which is an analogue of the vertebrate liver) produces yolk proteins for developing oocytes. JH is important for the fat body to acquire competence for yolk protein production. However, the molecular mechanisms of how JH promotes mosquito reproduction are not completely understood. In this study we show that stimulation of the JH receptor -tolerant (Met) activates expression of genes encoding the regulator of ribosome synthesis 1 (RRS1) and six ribosomal proteins (two ribosomal large subunit proteins, two ribosomal small subunit proteins, and two mitochondrial ribosomal proteins). Moreover, RNAi-mediated depletion of  decreased biosynthesis of the ribosomal protein L32 (RpL32). Depletion of , , or  led to retardation of ovarian growth and reduced mosquito fecundity, which may at least in part have resulted from decreased vitellogenin protein production in the fat body. In summary, our results indicate that JH is critical for inducing the expression of ribosomal protein genes and demonstrate that RRS1 mediates the JH signal to enhance both ribosomal biogenesis and vitellogenesis.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16983666>Effect of juvenile hormone on vitellogenin gene expression in the  body of burying beetles, Nicrophorus orbicollis.</a></h1><p>In the burying beetles, Nicrophorus orbicollis, it is not clear the extent to which synthesis of Vitellogenin (Vg) is under hormonal control. Juvenile hormone (JH) and ovarian development increase rapidly upon discovery of a carcass, the necessary reproductive resource, but in its absence, treatment with JH does not accelerate ovarian development. Here we investigated the effect of manipulating JH titers on Vg gene expression in the  bodies of newly eclosed and sexually mature females. Topical applications of the JH analogue  at doses of 200, 300, and 400 microg of /g beetle to newly eclosed females resulted in up to a 5-fold increase in  body Vg mRNA levels compared to acetone-treated control females. However, none of these increases were statistically significant. We also measured hemolymph Vg in females subjected to prolonged treatment with an intermediate dose of 300 microg of /g beetle and found no statistically significant increase in hemolymph Vg following treatment. There was, however, a significantly positive correlation between Vg mRNA and hemolymph Vg. Conversely, although injecting sexually mature females with fluvastatin (an inhibitor of JH biosynthesis in the corpora allata) at a dose of 40 microg/ beetle resulted in significantly decreased JH titers in treated females compared to saline-injected controls, Vg transcription rates were not affected. We suggest that in burying beetles, JH alone is not sufficient to upregulate the expression of the Vg genes and that other factors may be involved in regulating their vitellogenic cycle as well.(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29885502>Comparisons of microsomal cytochrome P450 content and enzymatic activity towards selected model substrates and insecticides in different tissues from the migratory locust (Locusta migratoria).</a></h1><p>Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) are important enzymes for biotransformations of various endogenous and xenobiotic substances in various organisms. In this study, we examined microsomal P450 protein content and enzymatic activity in four major detoxification tissues dissected from fifth-instar nymphs of the migratory locust (Locusta migratoria). The highest microsomal P450 protein content was found in the gastric caeca (a part of the midgut), followed by the midgut, Malpighian tubules and fat bodies. Microsomal P450s showed the highest aromatic hydroxylation, O-dealkylation and O-dearylation activities towards six of the seven model substrates examined in the fat bodies. Although the gastric caeca showed the highest P450 protein content, the enzymatic activities towards six of the seven model substrates were the lowest in this tissue. Further, the midgut, gastric caeca and fat bodies showed significant  activities towards two pyrethroid insecticides (deltamethrin and fluvalinate), but no significant activities towards the other four insecticides (malathion, chlorpyrifos, carbaryl and ). These results support our conclusions: 1) total P450 protein content alone cannot be reliably used to predict its enzymatic activity, and 2) insect P450 enzymatic activity is both tissue and substrate dependent.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This activity reaches a peak at 24 h following eclosion, and then drops to lower levels by 48 h. This pattern is not observed in males, consistent with the hypothesis that polyamine synthesis is involved in ovarian maturation in Drosophila. Abdomens isolated within 2 h of adult eclosion do not display elevated ODC activity or ovarian maturation. However, a 250-ng dose of the juvenile hormone analog  (ZR-515) applied in acetone to these abdomens, recovers ovarian maturation and causes a 5-10 fold increase in enzyme activity over controls treated with acetone alone. The same dose of the inactive precursor methyl farnesoate caused no such increase, whereas a 500-ng dose of the newly discovered natural Drosophila JHB3 stimulated a four-fold response. The response to  was dose-dependent, showing stimulatory activity at a dose as low as 10 ng. This stimulation by JHA is rapid, occurring between 1 and 3 h following hormone treatment, reminiscent of JH induction of  body vitellogenin synthesis in Drosophila. Elevated ODC activity appeared to be localized in the adult  body. During embryogenesis, ODC activity remained undetectable until just prior to hatching, when a large increase was detected. We postulate that JH may, either directly or indirectly, regulate polyamine biosynthesis in vivo, and that this synthesis may be required for the production of macromolecules during Drosophila vitellogenesis or embryogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9537760>The biosynthesis and processing of vitellogenin in the  bodies of females and males of the cockroach Leucophaea maderae.</a></h1><p>The juvenile hormone analog (JHA)  was used to induce the synthesis of the yolk protein precursor vitellogenin (Vg) in adult females and males of the cockroach Leucophaea maderae. The female- and male-produced vitellogenin (VgF and VgM, respectively) contained polypeptides of 112, 95, 92, and 54 kDa. Also present in the secreted vitellogenins was a soffmall quantity of a short-lived transitional 155 kDa Vg polypeptide, and a variable amount of an 85 dDa species. Quantitatively, the VgF and VgM were significantly different in the Vg112 and Vg95 units (VgF > VgM), and in the Vg85 polypeptide (VgF < VgM). In the present study, the biosynthesis of Vg precursors in the  bodies of females and males was examined using a short radiopulse with 35S-methionine/cysteine and 32P-orthophosphate. The glycosylation of the Vg precursors was examined by digestion with endoglycosidase H and by the inhibition of N-linked glycosylation with tunicamycin. The data showed that in both females and males, the synthesis of the vitellogenin precursor occurred in a stepwise fashion: (1) the co-translational glycosylation of Vg203; (2) the post-translational phosphorylation of Vg203 to form Vg220; (3) the proteolytic processing of Vg220 to form the constituent Vg polypeptides. The 203 and 220 kDa Vg precursors of females and males appeared to be similarly glycosylated and phosphorylated. The additional processing of Vg112 to Vg85 was more pronounced in the  bodies of males than in females, and appears to account for the quantitative difference in the distribution of these polypeptides in VgF and VgM. Finally, the major oligosaccharides of VgF and VgM appear to be those of N-linked mannose residues. The treatment of females and males with tunicamycin indicated that the co-translational glycosylation of Vg precursors was required for the phosphorylation of the Vg precursor, as well as the secretion of Vg from the  body.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1270682>Environmental degradation of the insect growth regulator .

Diapause-destined insects store large amounts of fat when preparing for diapause. However, the extent to which these accumulated fat reserves influence diapause remains unclear. To address this question, we investigated the function of fatty acid synthase (FAS), which plays a central role in lipid synthesis, in stress tolerance, the duration of diapause preparation, and whether insects enter diapause or not. In diapause-destined adult female cabbage beetles, Colaphellus bowringi, FAS2 was more highly expressed than FAS1 at the peak stage of diapause preparation. FAS2 knockdown suppressed lipid accumulation and subsequently affected stress tolerance genes expression and water content. However, silencing FAS2 had no significant effects on the duration of diapause preparation or the incidence of diapause. FAS2 transcription was suppressed by juvenile hormone (JH) and the JH receptor -tolerant (Met). These results suggest that the absence of JH-Met induces FAS2 expression, thereby promoting lipid storage in diapause-destined female beetles. These results demonstrate that fat reserves regulate stress tolerance genes expression and water content, but have no significant effect on the duration of diapause preparation or the incidence of diapause.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26274815>Regulation of Gene Expression Patterns in Mosquito Reproduction.</a></h1><p>In multicellular organisms, development, growth and reproduction require coordinated expression of numerous functional and regulatory genes. Insects, in addition to being the most speciose animal group with enormous biological and economical significance, represent outstanding model organisms for studying regulation of synchronized gene expression due to their rapid development and reproduction. Disease-transmitting female mosquitoes have adapted uniquely for ingestion and utilization of the huge blood meal required for swift reproductive events to complete egg development within a 72-h period. We investigated the network of regulatory factors mediating sequential gene expression in the fat body, a multifunctional organ analogous to the vertebrate liver and adipose tissue, of the female Aedes aegypti mosquito. Transcriptomic and bioinformatics analyses revealed that ~7500 transcripts are differentially expressed in four sequential waves during the 72-h reproductive period. A combination of RNA-interference gene-silencing and in-vitro organ culture identified the major regulators for each of these waves. Amino acids (AAs) regulate the first wave of gene activation between 3 h and 12 h post-blood meal (PBM). During the second wave, between 12 h and 36 h, most genes are highly upregulated by a synergistic action of AAs, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and the Ecdysone-Receptor (EcR). Between 36 h and 48 h, the third wave of gene activation-regulated mainly by HR3-occurs. Juvenile Hormone (JH) and its receptor -Tolerant (Met) are major regulators for the final wave between 48 h and 72 h. Each of these key regulators also has repressive effects on one or more gene sets. Our study provides a better understanding of the complexity of the regulatory mechanisms related to temporal coordination of gene expression during reproduction. We have detected the novel function of 20E/EcR responsible for transcriptional repression. This study also reveals the previously unidentified large-scale effects of HR3 and JH/Met on transcriptional regulation during the termination of vitellogenesis and remodeling of the fat body.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7663387>Roles of juvenile hormone, a brain factor and adipokinetic hormone in regulation of vitellogenin biosynthesis in locusta migratoria.</a></h1><p>In maturing adult female migratory locusts, the rises in JH and Vg in the hemolymph are greatly accelerated by enriched feeding; hereafter the JH titer fluctuates with vitellogenic cycles, falling to a low level at the oviposition stage. In  bodies incubated in vitro, the JH analog, , and brain extract from well-fed locusts (but not starved locusts) stimulated Vg synthesis synergistically. Repeated washing of  bodies from oviposition stage locusts led to a rise in Vg synthesis after 4 h, which was prevented by addition of locust adipokinetic hormone (AKH).

Two ILPs (Spoli-ILP1 and Spoli-ILP2) were identified in the cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis, while the functions and developmental characters are not fully understood. In the present study, we identified the partial sequence of a putative S. littoralis insulin receptor (Spoli-InR) and investigated the stage (age)- and tissue-dependent expression profile of Spoli-InR in addition to Spoli-ILPs during the last larval development and larval-pupal metamorphosis. Spoli-ILP1 and Spoli-ILP2 were specifically expressed in the brain, and their gene expressions were gradually decreased in concert with larval-pupal development. On the other hand, Spoli-InR was expressed in all the selected tissues (brain, testis,  body, Malpighian tubules, prothoracic glands and midgut), though the gene expression pattern was different among the tissues. Interestingly, the transcript expression pattern of Spoli-InR in the  body seemed to relate with larval-pupal development. In a parallel experiment, the juvenile hormone mimetic  was able to prolong the larval period when applied before the commitment peak of ecdysteroids titer in the hemolymph, and in this case the expression of Spoli-ILPs and Spoli-InR was affected. These results demonstrated first a relationship between transcript expression of Spoli-ILPs and larval-pupal development, and second they suggested the effect of ILPs may be controlled by not only Spoli-ILPs expression but also Spoli-InR expression.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

An appropriate JH titer in hemolymph is essential for normal development in insects. Information concerning its carrier partner protein, juvenile hormone binding protein (JHBP), provides an alternative approach to understanding how JH regulates metamorphosis. In this study, we cloned and sequenced the Omphisa juvenile hormone binding protein (OfJHBP). The full-length OfJHBP cDNA sequence is comprised of 849 nucleotides with an open reading frame of 726bp encoding 242 amino acids. The molecular mass of the protein was estimated to be 26.94kDa. The deduced protein sequence of OfJHBP showed moderate homology with the lepidopteran, Heliothis virescens JHBP (52% amino acid identity) and lower homology with the Bombyx mori JHBP (45%) and the Manduca sexta JHBP (44%). The OfJHBP was expressed mainly in the  body. OfJHBP transcripts in the  body was moderately high during 3rd, 4th and 5th instars, then rapidly increased, reaching a peak during early diapause. The expression remained high in mid-diapause, then decreased in late-diapause until the pupal stage. Both juvenile hormone analog (JHA), , 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) exhibited a similar stimulatory pattern in OfJHBP expression of diapausing larvae. OfJHBP mRNA levels gradually increased and showed a peak of gene expression on the penultimate, then declined to low levels in the pupal stage. For in vitro gene expression, both of JHA and 20E induced OfJHBP mRNA expression in  body.  body maintenance in vitro in the presence of 0.1μg/50μl JHA induced OfJHBP mRNA expression to high levels within the first 30min whereas 0.1μg/50μl 20E induced gene expression at 120min. To study the synergistic effect of these two hormones,  body was incubated in vitro with 0.1μg/50μl JHA or 0.1μg/50μl 20E or a combination of both hormone for 30min. Induction of OfJHBP expression by JHA and 20E was significantly greater than that of either hormone alone.

Dual luciferase assay identified a 120-bp JH response region (JHRR) in the Kr-h1α promoter. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that Met and Gce transduce JH signals to induce Kr-h1 expression through the JHRR. DNA affinity purification identified chaperone protein Hsp83 as one of the proteins bound to the JHRR in the presence of JH. Interestingly, Hsp83 physically interacts with PAS-B and basic helix-loop-helix domains of Met, and JH induces Met-Hsp83 interaction. As determined by immunohistochemistry, Met is mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of  body cells of the larval when the JH titer is low and JH induces Met nuclear import. Hsp83 was accumulated in the cytoplasm area adjunct to the nucleus in the presence of JH and Met/Gce. Loss-of-function of Hsp83 attenuated JH binding and JH-induced nuclear import of Met, resulting in a decrease in the JHRR-driven reporter activity leading to reduction of Kr-h1 expression.

Its involvement in gene activation is known to be mediated by the transcription factor -tolerant (Met), which turns on JH-controlled genes by directly binding to E-box-like motifs in their regulatory regions. However, it remains unclear how JH represses genes. We used the Aedes aegypti female mosquito, in which JH is necessary for reproductive maturation, to show that a repressor, Hairy, is required for the gene-repressive action of JH and Met. The RNA interference (RNAi) screen for Met and Hairy in the Aedes female fat body revealed a large cohort of Met- and Hairy-corepressed genes. Analysis of selected genes from this cohort demonstrated that they are repressed by JH, but RNAi of either Met or Hairy renders JH ineffective in repressing these genes in an in vitro fat-body culture assay. Moreover, this JH action was prevented by the addition of the translational inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) to the culture, indicating the existence of an indirect regulatory hierarchy. The lack of Hairy protein in the CHX-treated tissue was verified using immunoblot analysis, and the upstream regions of Met/Hairy-corepressed genes were shown to contain common binding motifs that interact with Hairy. Groucho (gro) RNAi silencing phenocopied the effect of Hairy RNAi knockdown, indicating that it is involved in the JH/Met/Hairy hierarchy. Finally, the requirement of Hairy and Gro for gene repression was confirmed in a cell transfection assay.

Surgical extirpation of corpora allata, the source of a juvenile hormone (JH), causes rapid accumulation of 30K proteins in the hemolymph of fourth instar larvae. The 30K protein 6G1 (30K6G1) gene was repressed in primary cultured  body cells treated with a JH analog (JHA), . To identify the JH response element present in the promoter region of the 30K6G1 gene, we performed transfection analyses of the 5'-deletion mutants of the 30K6G1 gene using primary cultured  body cells, gel retardation assays and in vivo footprinting analysis. The results from those analyses revealed that a JH response element exists in the sequence between positions -147 and -140. When the promoter construct mutated at positions -143, -142, and -141 was transfected to  body primary cultured cells, the suppression effect on the reporter gene expression caused by JHA was reduced. Gel retardation assay using specific antibody revealed that a PBX protein binds to the JH response element.

The granular component of the nucleolus containing ribosomal precursors increases considerably as well. These signs of nucleolar activation correlate with the synthetic rate and accumulation of poly(A)- RNA (predominantly ribosomal RNA) in the  body cells. The amount of poly(A)- RNA in  body cells increases during the first 2 days after eclosion and then declines gradually. The rate of RNA synthesis exhibits similar kinetics, but both the rise and the decline are sharper than for the accumulation of RNA. All the characteristics of nucleolar activation, its enlargement, accumulation of poly(A)- RNA, and the increased rate of RNA synthesis, are blocked by removal of the corpora allata (CA) in newly eclosed adult females but could be restored by either implantation of CA or topical application of juvenile hormone III or its analog, 7-S-, to allatectomized females.

In contrast, little is known about how juvenile hormone affects adult Drosophila melanogaster. Previous work suggests that insulin signaling may modulate Drosophila aging in part through its impact on juvenile hormone titer, but no data yet address whether reduction of juvenile hormone is sufficient to control Drosophila life span. Here we adapt a genetic approach to knock out the corpora allata in adult Drosophila melanogaster and characterize adult life history phenotypes produced by reduction of juvenile hormone. With this system we test potential explanations for how juvenile hormone modulates aging.A tissue specific driver inducing an inhibitor of a protein phosphatase was used to ablate the corpora allata while permitting normal development of adult flies. Corpora allata knockout adults had greatly reduced fecundity, inhibited oogenesis, impaired adult  body development and extended lifespan. Treating these adults with the juvenile hormone analog  restored all traits toward wildtype. Knockout females remained relatively long-lived even when crossed into a genotype that blocked all egg production. Dietary restriction further extended the lifespan of knockout females. In an analysis of expression profiles of knockout females in fertile and sterile backgrounds, about 100 genes changed in response to loss of juvenile hormone independent of reproductive state.Reduced juvenile hormone alone is sufficient to extend the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster. Reduced juvenile hormone limits reproduction by inhibiting the production of yolked eggs, and this may arise because juvenile hormone is required for the post-eclosion development of the vitellogenin-producing adult  body. Our data do not support a mechanism for juvenile hormone control of longevity simply based on reducing the physiological costs of egg production. Nor does the longevity benefit appear to function through mechanisms by which dietary restriction extends longevity. We identify transcripts that change in response to juvenile hormone independent of reproductive state and suggest these represent somatically expressed genes that could modulate how juvenile hormone controls persistence and longevity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23523827>Nuclear receptors HR96 and ultraspiracle from the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda), developmental expression and induction by xenobiotics.</a></h1><p>The fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda is a major polyphagous pest in agriculture and little is known on how this insect can adapt to the diverse and potentially toxic plant allelochemicals that they ingest or to insecticides.

We also cloned ultraspiracle (USP), the ortholog of retinoid X receptor (RXR) that serves as partner of dimerization of PXR and CAR.

The expression of these receptors as well as the ecdysone receptor was studied during specific steps of development in different tissues. SfHR96 was constitutively expressed in larval midgut,  body and Malpighian tubules throughout the last two instars and pupal stage, as well as in Sf9 cells. EcR and SfUSP-2 showed peaks of expression before larval moults and during metamorphosis, whereas SfUSP-1 was mainly expressed in the pre-pupal stage. Receptor induction was followed after exposure of larvae or cells to 11 chemical compounds. SfHR96 was not inducible by the tested compounds. EcR was significantly induced by the 20-hydroxyecdysone agonist, methoxyfenozide, and SfUSP showed an increase expression when exposed to the juvenile hormone analog, . The cloning of these nuclear receptors is a first step in understanding the important capacities of adaptation of this insect pest.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Metabolism in female mosquitoes is tightly coupled with blood meal-mediated reproduction, which requires an extremely high level of  consumption. Functional analysis has shown that major genes encoding for enzymes involved in lipid metabolism (LM) in the mosquito fat bodies are down-regulated at the end of the juvenile hormone (JH)-controlled posteclosion (PE) phase but exhibit significant elevation in their transcript levels during the post-blood meal phase (PBM), which is regulated mainly by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). Reductions in the transcript levels of genes encoding triacylglycerol (TAG) catabolism and β-oxidation enzymes were observed to correlate with a dramatic accumulation of lipids in the PE phase; in contrast, these transcripts were elevated significantly and lipid stores were diminished during the PBM phase. The RNAi depletion of -tolerant (Met) and ecdysone receptor (EcR), receptors for JH and 20E, respectively, reversed the LM gene expression and the levels of lipid stores and metabolites, demonstrating the critical roles of these hormones in LM regulation. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) RNAi-silenced mosquitoes exhibited down-regulation of the gene transcripts encoding TAG catabolism and β-oxidation enzymes and an inability to use lipids effectively, as manifested by TAG accumulation. The luciferase reporter assay showed direct regulation of LM-related genes by HNF4. Moreover,  gene expression was down-regulated by Met and activated by EcR and Target of rapamycin, providing a link between nutritional and hormonal regulation of LM in female mosquitoes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7627204>The juvenile hormone receptor of the cockroach Leucophaea maderae.</a></h1><p>The juvenile hormone (JH) receptor has been isolated and purified from  bodies of females and males of Leucophaea maderae. The sequence of procedures that yielded an apparently pure compound involved ammonium sulfate precipitation (20-60% saturation cut), DEAE anion exchange column chromatography, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular size of the resulting high affinity JH-binding protein is about 64 kDa and is apparently composed of two equal subunits of 32 kDa. A polyclonal antibody has been produced against this molecule and used for the construction of an immunoaffinity column. A pure JH receptor molecule has been isolated from crude  body homogenates with this affinity column. The JH receptor is first identified in last instar nymphs and quantitatively increases as the instar progresses towards adult development. In penultimate nymphal instars this JH receptor could not be identified and this is correlated with a lack of competence to make vitellogenin (Vg) upon exposure to the JH analog . Thus, a correlation is seen between the presence of the JH receptor and the competence to synthesize Vg.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9753765>Nucleotide sequence of vitellogenin mRNA in the bean bug, Riptortus clavatus: analysis of processing in the  body and ovary.</a></h1><p>The bean bug, Riptortus clavatus, has immunologically distinct yolk proteins, vitellin (Vn)-1 and-2 and their precursors, vitellogenin (Vg)-1 and-2. We have cloned the full nucleotide sequence of Vg-1 cDNA. The deduced amino acid sequence has some similarities to other insect Vgs. It contains two polyserine regions, which are characteristic of other Vgs. Vg-1 mRNA appeared after treatment with the juvenile hormone analogue, , implying transcriptional regulation. We found four enzymatic cleavage sites in the Vg molecule. Two of them match the consensus for dibasic processing endoprotease, which is also conserved in processing sites for other insect Vgs. We showed that the processing at each site was incomplete, and this resulted in production of more than the five polypeptides which would be expected from four processing sites in the molecule. The physiological significance of multiple polypeptides in insect Vgs is still unclear.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6177387>Vitellogenin mRNA in locust  body: identification, isolation, and quantitative changes induced by juvenile hormone.</a></h1><p>Change in RNA during the juvenile hormone (JH) stimulated synthesis of vitellogenin (Vg) in the  body of adult female Locusta migratoria have been studied. Total RNA from mature females, but not that from males or prereproductive females, shows a 6300 nucleotide component, which has been isolated by binding to oligo(dT)-cellulose and sucrose gradient centrifugation, and identified as Vg mRNA by translation in Xenopus oocytes. It has been assayed quantitatively by photometric scanning after electrophoresis. During a gonotrophic cycle, Vg mRNA increased rapidly from 0 up to about 1% of the total  body RNA, or more than 10(6) copies per cell. After destruction of the corpora allata (the source of JH) by treatment with ethoxyprecocene, Vg synthesis was stimulated by injection of 150 micrograms of the JH analog, . In primary stimulation, Vg mRNA was first detected at 24 h and showed a marked lag in accumulation; in secondary stimulation by  after decay of the primary effect, Vg mRNA was detected after only 12 h and accumulation was much more rapid. Both in the natural cycle and in experimental stimulation, Vg mRNA did not disappear in correlation with declining Vg synthesis, which suggests conservation of mRNA in untranslated form. Total (chiefly ribosomal) RNA showed a different pattern, accumulating markedly during primary and only slightly during secondary stimulation. The data indicate that JH acts selectively (though not necessarily directly) on transcription of the Vg genes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10876128>Intracellular localization and tissue specificity of the -tolerant (Met) gene product in Drosophila melanogaster.</a></h1><p>The -tolerant (Met) gene product in Drosophila melanogaster facilitates the action of juvenile hormone (JH) and JH analog insecticides. Previous work resulted in the cloning and identification of the gene as a member of the bHLH-PAS family of transcriptional regulators. A Met(+) cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli, and polyclonal antibody was prepared against the purified protein. A single band on a Western blot at the expected size of 79kD was detected in extracts from Met(+) larvae but not from Met(27) null mutant larvae, demonstrating the antibody specificity. Antibody detected MET in all stages of D. melanogaster development and showed tissue specificity of its expression. MET is present in all cells of early embryos but dissipates during gastrulation. In larvae it is present in larval  body, certain imaginal cells, and immature salivary glands. In pupae it persists in  body cells and imaginal cells, including abdominal histoblast cells. In adult females MET is present in ovarian follicle cells and spermathecae; in adult males it is present in male accessory gland and ejaculatory duct cells. In all of these tissues MET is found exclusively in the nucleus. Some of these tissues are known JH target tissues but others are not, suggesting either the presence of novel JH target tissues or another function for MET.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23499946>Juvenile hormone and insulin suppress lipolysis between periods of lactation during tsetse fly pregnancy.</a></h1><p>Tsetse flies are viviparous insects that nurture a single intrauterine progeny per gonotrophic cycle. The developing larva is nourished by the -rich, milk-like secretions from a modified female accessory gland (milk gland). An essential feature of the lactation process involves  mobilization for incorporation into the milk. In this study, we examined roles for juvenile hormone (JH) and insulin/IGF-like (IIS) signaling pathways during tsetse pregnancy. In particular, we examined the roles for these pathways in regulating  homeostasis during transitions between non-lactating (dry) and lactating periods. The dry period occurs over the course of oogenesis and embryogenesis, while the lactation period spans intrauterine larvigenesis. Genes involved in the JH and IIS pathways were upregulated during dry periods, correlating with  accumulation between bouts of lactation. RNAi suppression of Forkhead Box Sub Group O (FOXO) expression impaired lipolysis during tsetse lactation and reduced fecundity. Similar reduction of the JH receptor  tolerant (Met), but not its paralog germ cell expressed (gce), reduced  accumulation during dry periods, indicating functional divergence between Met and gce during tsetse reproduction. Reduced  levels following Met knockdown led to impaired fecundity due to inadequate  reserves at the initiation of milk production. Both the application of the JH analog (JHA)  and injection of insulin into lactating females increased stored lipids by suppressing lipolysis and reduced transcripts of lactation-specific genes, leading to elevated rates of larval abortion. To our knowledge, this study is the first to address the molecular physiology of JH and IIS in a viviparous insect, and specifically to provide a role for JH signaling through Met in the regulation of  during insect lactation.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

At present it is unknown whether the signaling pathway involving the JH receptor gene  tolerant (Met) and its binding partner Taiman (Tai), regulates the synthesis of accessory gland proteins (ACPs) and hexamerin proteins or effects male survival. Knockdown of genes by injecting Met dsRNA or Tai dsRNA, reduced the amount of ACPs whilst enhancing the amount of hexamerin mRNA in the fat body and the release of hexamerin proteins into haemolymph, as occurs after the ablation of CA. Lifespan was enhanced by injecting Met but not Tai dsRNA. Diapause associated with the natural absence of JH had a stronger effect on all these parameters than the ablation of CA or the knockdown of genes. This indicates there is an additional regulating agent. Both Met and Tai dsRNA induced a several fold increase in JH (JH III skiped bisepoxide) but a concurrent loss of Met or Tai disabled its function. This supports the view that the Met/Tai complex functions as a JH receptor in the regulation of ACPs and hexamerins.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Topical supply of  to newly emerged adult female D. cingulatus caused notable disturbance and induced a dramatic reduction in the total haemolymph protein pattern and lipophorin production in tissues like  body, ovary and haemolymph. Total protein concentration in haemolymph also showed significant reduction in 1 day old insects but increased slightly as age advanced.

We studied changes in O(2) consumption in conjunction with cytochrome c oxidase activity and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1) gene expression. O(2) consumption changed within a day, showing a supradian rhythm with a ca.12-h cycle at 25 degrees C. During the first two-thirds of the diapause period, from October to March, O(2) consumption was constant until January and then increased by March. Topical application of , a juvenile hormone analog (JHA), to diapausing larvae terminated the diapause and was associated with an increase in O(2) consumption rate at diapause termination. In JHA-treated larvae, cytochrome c oxidase activity in  bodies was high at the beginning of the prepupal period and highest at pupation. cox1 expression in  bodies displayed a transient peak 8 days after JHA application and peaked in the prepupal period. Taken together, our results show that the break of diapause by JHA is associated with the activation of cox1, bringing about an increase in cytochrome c oxidase activity, followed by an increase in O(2) consumption rate.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27180724>Juvenile hormone facilitates the antagonism between adult reproduction and diapause through the -tolerant gene in the female Colaphellus bowringi.</a></h1><p>In insects, the process whereby juvenile hormone (JH) regulates short-day (SD)-induced reproductive diapause has been previously investigated. However, we still do not understand the mechanism by which JH regulates long-day (LD)-induced reproductive diapause. In this study, we use a cabbage beetle, Colaphellus bowringi, which is a serious pest of cruciferous vegetables in Asia capable of entering reproductive diapause under LD conditions, as a model to test whether JH regulates female reproductive diapause similar to the mechanism of SD-induced diapause. Our results showed that the JH analog (JHA)  significantly induced ovarian development but inhibited lipid accumulation of diapause-destined adults. Meanwhile, the transcripts of the vitellogenin (Vg) genes were upregulated, whereas the expression of the fat synthesis and stress tolerance genes were downregulated. RNA interference of the JH candidate receptor gene -tolerant (Met) blocked JH-induced ovarian development and Vg transcription, suggesting a positive regulatory function for JH-Met signaling in reproduction. Furthermore, under reproduction-inducing conditions, Met depletion promoted a diapause-like phenotype, including arrested ovarian development and increased lipid storage, and stimulated the expression of diapause-related genes involved in lipid synthesis and stress tolerance, suggesting JH-Met signaling plays an important role in the inhibition of diapause. Accordingly, our data indicate that JH acts through Met to facilitate development of the reproductive system by upregulating Vg expression while inhibiting diapause by suppressing lipid synthesis and stress tolerance in the cabbage beetle. Combined with previous studies in SD-induced reproductive diapause, we conclude that JH may regulate female reproductive diapause using a conserved Met-dependent pathway, regardless of the length of the photoperiod inducing diapause in insects.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The Drosophila melanogaster insulin-like receptor (InR) mutant showed extended life span due to reduced juvenile hormone (JH) levels. However, little is known about the mechanism of cross talk between IIS and JH in regulation of life span extension and resistance to starvation. In the current study, we investigated the role of IIS and JH signaling in regulation of resistance to starvation. Reduction in JH biosynthesis, JH action, or insulin-like peptide 2 (ILP2) syntheses by RNA interference (RNAi)-aided knockdown in the expression of genes coding for juvenile hormone acid methyltransferase (JHAMT), -tolerant (Met), or ILP2 respectively decreased  and carbohydrate  and extended the survival of starved beetles. Interestingly, the extension of life span could be restored by injection of bovine insulin into JHAMT RNAi beetles but not by application of JH III to ILP2 RNAi beetles. These data suggest that JH controls starvation resistance by regulating synthesis of ILP2. More importantly, JH regulates trehalose homeostasis, including trehalose transport and , and controls utilization of stored nutrients in starved adults.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25963043>Genomic and functional characterization of a -tolerant gene in the kissing-bug Rhodnius prolixus.</a></h1><p>Metamorphosis, which depends upon a fine balance between two groups of lipid-soluble hormones such as juvenile hormones (JHs) and ecdysteroids, is an important feature in insect evolution. While it is clear that the onset of metamorphosis depends on the decrease of JH levels, the way in which these hormones exert their activities is not fully understood in Triatominae species. The discovery of a Drosophila melanogaster mutant resistant to the treatment with the JH analog , led finally to the description of the -tolerant gene in Tribolium castaneum (TcMet) as a putative JH receptor. Here we present the genomic and functional characterization of an ortholog of the -tolerant gene in the hemimetabolous insect Rhodnius prolixus (RpMet). The analysis of the R. prolixus gene showed that the exonic structure is different from that described for holometabolous species, although all the critical protein motifs are well conserved. Expression analysis showed the presence of RpMet mRNA in all the tested tissues: ovary, testis, rectum, Malpighian tubules and salivary glands. When juvenile individuals were treated with RpMet specific double strand RNA (dsRNA), we observed abnormal molting events that resulted in individuals with morphological alterations (adultoids). Similarly, treatment of newly emerged fed females with dsRNA resulted in an abnormal development of the ovaries, with eggs revealing anomalies in size and accumulation of yolk, as well as a decrease in the amount of heme-binding protein. Altogether, our results validate that RpMet is involved in the transduction of JH signaling, controlling metamorphosis and reproduction in R. prolixus.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

To analyze the molecular mechanisms involved in diapause termination we explored the possibility that the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are involved in this response. Levels of phospho-ERK increased within 10 min after hexane application. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was also activated when pupae were transferred from 20 to 25 degrees C, thus suggesting that ERK activation is a likely component of the signal transduction pathway used to initiate development in response to diapause-terminating signals. 20-Hydroxyecdysone and cyclic GMP terminate diapause in this fly, and the juvenile hormone analog  shortens the diapause, but none of these agents activated ERK. ERK was readily activated in isolated abdomens treated with hexane, thus we conclude that ERK is directly activated by the hexane treatment. ERK activation was evident in the brain, epidermis, midgut and  body, but not in the ventral nerve mass or ring gland, thus suggesting that ERK does not act directly on the ring gland to promote ecdysteroid synthesis but exerts its effect through stimulation of the brain.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17438290>Vitellogenin, juvenile hormone, insulin signaling, and queen honey bee longevity.</a></h1><p>In most animals, longevity is achieved at the expense of fertility, but queen honey bees do not show this tradeoff. Queens are both long-lived and fertile, whereas workers, derived from the same genome, are both relatively short-lived and normally sterile. It has been suggested, on the basis of results from workers, that vitellogenin (Vg), best known as a yolk protein synthesized in the abdominal  body, acts as an antioxidant to promote longevity in queen bees. We explored this hypothesis, as well as related roles of insulin-IGF-1 signaling and juvenile hormone. Vg was expressed in thorax and head  body cells in an age-dependent manner, with old queens showing much higher expression than workers. In contrast, Vg expression in worker head was much lower. Queens also were more resistant to oxidative stress than workers. These results support the hypothesis that caste-specific differences in Vg expression are involved in queen longevity. Consistent with predictions from Drosophila, old queens had lower head expression of insulin-like peptide and its putative receptors than did old workers. Juvenile hormone affected the expression of Vg and insulin-IGF-1 signaling genes in opposite directions. These results suggest that conserved and species-specific mechanisms interact to regulate queen bee longevity without sacrificing fecundity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26216039>Endocrine remodelling of the adult intestine sustains reproduction in Drosophila.</a></h1><p>The production of offspring is energetically costly and relies on incompletely understood mechanisms that generate a positive  balance. In mothers of many species, changes in key -associated internal organs are common yet poorly characterised functionally and mechanistically. In this study, we show that, in adult Drosophila females, the midgut is dramatically remodelled to enhance reproductive output. In contrast to extant models, organ remodelling does not occur in response to increased nutrient intake and/or offspring demands, but rather precedes them. With spatially and temporally directed manipulations, we identify juvenile hormone (JH) as an anticipatory endocrine signal released after mating. Acting through intestinal bHLH-PAS domain proteins -tolerant (Met) and Germ cell-expressed (Gce), JH signals directly to intestinal progenitors to yield a larger organ, and adjusts gene expression and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) activity in enterocytes to support increased lipid metabolism. Our findings identify a metabolically significant paradigm of adult somatic organ remodelling linking hormonal signals, epithelial plasticity, and reproductive output.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25017142>Krüppel-homolog 1 mediates juvenile hormone action to promote vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation in the migratory locust.</a></h1><p>Juvenile hormone (JH) prevents insect larval metamorphosis and stimulates processes for adult reproduction. Krüppel-homolog 1 (Kr-h1), a zinc finger transcription factor, is shown to mediate the anti-metamorphic effect of JH in both holometabolous and hemimetabolous insects. However, the role of Kr-h1 in JH-mediated reproduction has not been determined. Using the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria, we showed here that Kr-h1 was expressed in response to JH in female adults, and Kr-h1 transcription was directly regulated by the JH-receptor complex comprised of -tolerant (Met) and steroid receptor co-activator. We demonstrated that Kr-h1 RNAi phenocopied Met RNAi and JH-deprived condition during post-eclosion development and vitellogenesis of female locusts. Knockdown of Kr-h1 resulted in substantial reduction of Vg expression in the  body and  accumulation in the primary oocytes, accompanied by blocked follicular epithelium development, oocyte maturation and ovarian growth. Our data therefore reveal a crucial role of Kr-h1 in insect vitellogenesis and egg production. This study suggests that JH-Met-Kr-h1 signaling pathway is also functional in insect reproduction.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The molecular mass of the protein was 490 kDa and it was composed of two 188-kDa subunits. Three internal amino acid sequences obtained by digestion of the protein with lysylendopeptidase showed high similarity to those of Bombyx mori Vg, supporting the purified blue protein to be vitellogenin. latroscan analyses demonstrated the presence of biliverdin in Vg that occupied 2.4% of total  components. Among the lipids of Vg (9.5 micrograms total lipids per 100 micrograms protein), diacylglycerol was the most predominant, followed by phospholipid, hydrocarbons, and then triacylglycerol, while in biliverdin-binding proteins (BPs) purified from larval hemolymph (3.1 micrograms total lipids per 100 micrograms protein), phospholipid was the most abundant  followed by diacylglycerol; hydrocarbons and triacylglycerol were minor components.
