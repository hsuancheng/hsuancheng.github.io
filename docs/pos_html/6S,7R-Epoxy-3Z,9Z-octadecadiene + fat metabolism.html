Carcinogenesis alters lipid  to facilitate cell growth and survival. For instance, metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are associated with increasing colon cell proliferation. Moreover, precancerous colon lesions (i.e. adenomas) increase the risk for colorectal cancer. In this study, we investigated associations between plasma PUFAs and the number of colon polyps and polyp type (i.e. hyperplastic and adenoma). Healthy male participants (n=126) of 48-65 years of age were recruited before a routine colonoscopy screening. Plasma phospholipid (PPL) PUFAs were isolated by means of solid phase extraction and methylated. Fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed using gas chromatography. Factor analysis was used to cluster PUFAs into groups, and then generated factors and individual PUFAs were analyzed using polytomous logistic regression. In our age-adjusted and smoking-adjusted polytomous logistic regression, for each unit increase in PPL docosatetraenoic acid (DTA), individuals were 1.43 (1.00-2.06) and 1.33 (0.99-1.80) times more likely to have hyperplastic polyps and adenomas rather than no polyps, respectively. In our factor analysis, high PPL ω-6 PUFA and trans-fatty acid loading scores were associated with increased odds of adenoma presence rather than no polyps. Increases in long-chain PPL ω-6 PUFAs are associated with an increased risk for adenomas. As relative levels of DTA increase in PPLs, individuals had increased odds of having hyperplastic polyps and adenomas. Elevated conversion of ω-6 PUFAs to longer-chain ω- such as DTA may indicate altered PUFA  at the tissue level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29753580>Acceleration of diabetic wound healing with adipose-derived stem cells, endothelial-differentiated stem cells, and topical conditioned medium therapy in a swine model.</a></h2><p>The purpose of our study was to investigate the effect of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), endothelial-differentiated ASCs (EC/ASCs), and various conditioned media (CM) on wound healing in a diabetic swine model. We hypothesized that ASC-based therapies would accelerate wound healing.Diabetes was induced in four Yorkshire swine through intravenous injection of streptozotocin. ASCs were harvested from flank  and cultured in either M199 or EGM-2 medium. A duplicate series of seven full-thickness dorsal wounds were surgically created on each swine. The wounds in the cellular treatment group underwent injection of low-dose or high-dose ASCs or EC/ASCs on day 0, with a repeat injection of one half of the initial dose on day 15. Wounds assigned to the topical CM therapy were covered with 2 mL of either serum-free M199 primed by ASCs or human umbilical vein endothelial cells every 3 days. Wounds were assessed at day 0, 10, 15, 20, and 28. The swine were sacrificed on day 28. ImageJ software was used to evaluate the percentage of wound healing. The wounded skin underwent histologic, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay examinations to evaluate markers of angiogenesis and inflammation.We found an increase in the percentage of wound closure rates in cell-based treatments and topical therapies at various points compared with the untreated control wounds (P < .05). The results from the histologic, messenger RNA, and protein analyses suggested the treated wounds displayed increased angiogenesis and a diminished inflammatory response.Cellular therapy with ASCs, EC/ASCs, and topical CM accelerated diabetic wound healing in the swine model. Enhanced angiogenesis and immunomodulation might be key contributors to this process.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The most important factors in the development of cardiovascular diseases are dyslipidemia and impaired renal function. The aim of the study was to investigate the  spectrum and renal function in liver recipients in real clinical practice and the correspondence of their correction to current clinical recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of dyslipidemia and chronic kidney disease (CKD).A retrospective analysis of  spectrum and renal function in patients who underwent OLT in Research Institute - Regional Clinical Hospital №1, Krasnodar was performed. The level of creatinine, GFR and  spectrum was studied before and 36 months after liver transplantation. The GFR was calculated using the formula CKD‑EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration). Statistical analysis of the study results was made using the program Statistica 10.Liver recipients have a significantly higher total cholesterol by 31.0% (p&lt;0.01) in comparison with the baseline before surgery. Total cholesterol was increased in 13.7% (p&lt;0.01), triglycerides in 12.3% (p&lt;0.01) before transplantation. Tree years after transplantation, the increasion in cholesterol was registered in 42.6% (p&lt;0.01) and triglycerides in 37.9% (p &lt;0.01), respectively. 3 years after transplantation reduction of GFR was observed in comparison with the baseline by 22.6% (p=0.00006). Verification of chronic kidney disease and statin administration in patients were carried out in some cases. The levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides had a reliable inverse correlation with GFR (r = ‑0.42; p&lt;0.01 and r = ‑0.36; p&lt;0.05).In the long‑term postoperative period there was an impaired  and decreased level of GFR. Dyslipidemia was closely related to the progression of renal dysfunction in liver recipients, an inverse correlation was established between the glomerular filtration rate and the increasion in cholesterol and triglyceride levels. It is necessary to increase the attention of physicians with regard to timely correction of  disorders and detection of initial manifestations of renal dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26076464>Effects of Acute Supramaximal Cycle Exercise on Plasma FFA Concentration in Obese Adolescent Boys.</a></h2><p>The aims of the present study are 1) to evaluate the free fatty acid (FFA) profile and 2) to determine the relative anaerobic and aerobic contributions to total energy consumption during repeated supramaximal cycling bouts (SCE) in adolescent boys with different body weight statuses.Normal-weight (NW), overweight (OW), and obese (OB) adolescent boys (n =15 per group) completed a SCE sessions consisted of 6 x  maximal sprints with 2 min of passive rest between each repetition. Plasma FFA levels were determined at rest, immediately after a 10 min warm-up, and immediately at the end of SCE. The anaerobic and aerobic contributions (%) were measured via repeated SCE bouts. Insulin resistance was calculated using the homoeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) index.The FFA concentrations measured immediately after SCE were higher in the OB group than in the OW and NW (p<0.01 and p<0.01, respectively) groups. Moreover, the anaerobic contributions to SCE were significantly lower in obese adolescents (p<0.01) and decreased significantly during the 2nd, 3rd and 4th repetitions. The FFA levels were significantly associated with the HOMA-IR index and aerobic contribution among adolescent boys (r=0.83 and r=0.91, respectively, p<0.01).In contrast to the NW and OW groups, there is an increase in lipid mobilization and sift to aerobic energy  during SCE in the OB group.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27101738>Knockdown of delta-5-desaturase promotes the anti-cancer activity of dihomo-γ-linolenic acid and enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy in colon cancer cells expressing COX-2.</a></h2><p>Cyclooxygenase (COX), commonly overexpressed in cancer cells, is a major lipid peroxidizing enzyme that metabolizes polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3s and ω-). The COX-catalyzed free radical peroxidation of arachidonic acid (ω-6) can produce deleterious metabolites (e.g. 2-series prostaglandins) that are implicated in cancer development. Thus, COX inhibition has been intensively investigated as a complementary therapeutic strategy for cancer. However, our previous study has demonstrated that a free radical-derived byproduct (8-hydroxyoctanoic acid) formed from COX-catalyzed peroxidation of dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA, the precursor of arachidonic acid) can inhibit colon cancer cell growth. We thus hypothesize that the commonly overexpressed COX in cancer (~90% of colon cancer patients) can be taken advantage to suppress cell growth by knocking down delta-5-desaturase (D5D, a key enzyme that converts DGLA to arachidonic acid). In addition, D5D knockdown along with DGLA supplement may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs. After knocking down D5D in HCA-7 colony 29 cells and HT-29 cells (human colon cancer cell lines with high and low COX levels, respectively), the antitumor activity of DGLA was significantly enhanced along with the formation of a threshold range (~0.5-1.0μM) of 8-hydroxyoctanoic acid. In contrast, DGLA treatment did not inhibit cell growth when D5D was not knocked down and only limited amount of 8-hydroxyoctanoic acid was formed. D5D knockdown along with DGLA treatment also enhanced the cytotoxicities of various chemotherapeutic drugs, including 5-fluorouracil, regorafenib, and irinotecan, potentially through the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins, e.g. p53 and caspase 9. For the first time, we have demonstrated that the overexpressed COX in cancer cells can be utilized in suppressing cancer cell growth. This finding may provide a new option besides COX inhibition to optimize cancer therapy. The outcome of this translational research will guide us to develop a novel ω-6-based diet-care strategy in combination with current chemotherapy for colon cancer prevention and treatment.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27984176>PARP inhibition protects against alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, and  reprograming are crucial contributors to hepatic injury and subsequent liver fibrosis. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) and their interactions with sirtuins play an important role in regulating intermediary  in this process. However, there is little research into whether PARP inhibition affects alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH/NASH).We investigated the effects of genetic deletion of PARP1 and pharmacological inhibition of PARP in models of early alcoholic steatohepatitis, as well as on Kupffer cell activation in vitro using biochemical assays, real-time PCR, and histological analyses. The effects of PARP inhibition were also evaluated in high fat or methionine and choline deficient diet-induced steatohepatitis models in mice.PARP activity was increased in livers due to excessive alcohol intake, which was associated with decreased NAD content and SIRT1 activity. Pharmacological inhibition of PARP restored the hepatic NAD content, attenuated the decrease in SIRT1 activation and beneficially affected the -, inflammatory-, and oxidative stress-related alterations due to alcohol feeding in the liver. PARP1 animals were protected against alcoholic steatohepatitis and pharmacological inhibition of PARP or genetic deletion of PARP1 also attenuated Kupffer cell activation in vitro. Furthermore, PARP inhibition decreased hepatic triglyceride accumulation,  dysregulation, or inflammation and/or fibrosis in models of NASH.Our results suggests that PARP inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy in steatohepatitis with high translational potential, considering the availability of PARP inhibitors for clinical treatment of cancer.Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) are the most abundant nuclear enzymes. The PARP inhibitor olaparib (Lynparza) is a recently FDA-approved therapy for cancer. This study shows that PARP is overactivated in livers of subjects with alcoholic liver disease and that pharmacological inhibition of this enzyme with 3 different PARP inhibitors, including olaparib, attenuates high fat or alcohol induced liver injury, abnormal  alteration, fat accumulation, inflammation and/or fibrosis in preclinical models of liver disease. These results suggest that PARP inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy in the treatment of alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver diseases.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25305414>Effect of hepatocyte-specific gadolinium-based contrast agents on hepatic fat-fraction and R2(⁎).</a></h2><p>The purpose of this work was to investigate the effect of a hepatocyte-specific gadolinium based contrast agent (GBCA) on quantitative hepatic fat-fraction (FF) and R2* measurements. Fifty patients were imaged at 1.5T, using chemical-shift encoded water-fat MRI with low (5°) and high (15°) flip angles (FA), both before and after administration of a hepatocyte-specific GBCA (gadoxetic acid). Low and high FA, pre- and post-contrast FF and R2* values were measured for each subject. Available serum laboratory studies related to liver disease were also recorded. Linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis were performed to compare measurements. Hepatic FF was unaffected by GBCA at low FA (slope=1.02±0.02, p=0.32). FF was overestimated at high FA pre-contrast (slope=1.33±0.03, p<10(-10)), but underestimated post-contrast (slope=0.81±0.02, p<10(-10)). Hepatic R2* was unaffected by FA (mean difference±95% CI pre-contrast:2.2±4.9s(-1), post-contrast:2.8±3.(-1)), but increased post-contrast in patients with total bilirubin <2.5mg/dL (ΔR2*=13.4±12.7s(-1)). Regression analysis of serum values demonstrated a correlation of post-contrast change in R2* with total bilirubin (p<0.01) and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (p≈0.01). In conclusion, GBCA has no effect on hepatic FF at low FA due to a lack of T1-weighting, potentially allowing flexibility for FF imaging with hepatobiliary imaging protocols. Hepatic R2* increased significantly after GBCA administration, particularly in the biliary tree. Therefore, R2* maps should be obtained prior to contrast administration.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The aims of this study were to assess the relative value of endothelial inflammatory markers for this application and to develop molecular ultrasound contrast agents for their imaging.Human CEA specimens were obtained prospectively from asymptomatic (30) and symptomatic (30) patients. Plaques were assessed by semiquantitative immunohistochemistry for vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1, P-selectin, and von Willebrand factor. Established small peptide ligands to each of these targets were then synthesized and covalently conjugated to the surface of -shelled microbubble ultrasound contrast agents, which were then evaluated in a flow chamber for binding kinetics to activated human aortic endothelial cells under variable shear conditions.Expression of VCAM-1 on the endothelium of CEA specimens from symptomatic patients was 2.4-fold greater than that from asymptomatic patients (P < .01). Expression was not significantly different between groups for P-selectin (P = .43), von Willebrand factor (P = .59), or lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (P = .99). Although most plaques from asymptomatic patients displayed low VCAM-1 expression, approximately one in five expressed high VCAM-1 similar to plaques from symptomatic patients. In vitro flow chamber experiments demonstrated that VCAM-1-targeted microbubbles bind cells that express VCAM-1, even under high-shear conditions that approximate those found in human carotid arteries, whereas binding efficiency was lower for the other agents.VCAM-1 displays significantly higher expression on high-risk (symptomatic) vs low-risk (asymptomatic) carotid plaques. Ultrasound contrast agents bearing ligands for VCAM-1 can sustain high-shear attachment and may be useful for identifying patients in whom more aggressive treatment is warranted.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Enhancement of autologous fat grafts with the addition of the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) has been reported to improve long-term volume retention. Stromal vascular fraction is most commonly isolated using enzymatic digestion, but it is unknown what effect the digestion process has on the adipocytes and SVF cells that comprise the graft. Some clinicians have reported use of enzymatically digested fat grafts to alter the physical properties of the tissue in specialized applications. We have previously reported that increasing collagenase digestion duration adversely affects the viability of adipocytes and SVF cells. Here, we aimed to determine if collagenase digestion of adipocytes before grafting is detrimental to long-term graft retention and if SVF supplementation can abrogate these potential deleterious effects.We used a published xenograft model in which human lipoaspirate was implanted into the scalp of immunocompromised mice to study the effects of collagenase digestion on in vivo graft survival after 12 weeks. We used 4 experimental groups: grafts composed of collagenase-digested and nondigested adipocytes (50-minute digestion) and grafts with and without SVF supplementation. We used microcomputed tomography to serially and noninvasively quantify graft volume, in conjunction with hematoxylin-eosin staining of histological cross-sections of implanted and excised grafts to assess overall tissue viability. We found that adipocytes that were collagenase-digested before implantation had significantly lower retention rates at 12 weeks and poorer tissue health, which was assessed by quantifying the number of intact adipocytes, the number of cystic formations, and by scoring the degree of inflammation and fibrosis. Further, we found that SVF supplementation of the digested grafts improved graft survival, but not to the level observed in undigested grafts.We conclude that collagenase digestion adversely affects the long-term volume retention of fat grafts, but that graft retention is improved by SVF supplementation. These experimental results can serve as an initial framework to further elucidate the reported efficacy and safety of using collagenase-digested fat grafts and SVF in the clinical setting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30470363>Resolvin D1 decreases abdominal aortic aneurysm formation by inhibiting NETosis in a mouse model.</a></h2><p>Resolvins have been shown to attenuate inflammation, whereas NETosis, the process of neutrophils releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), produces increased inflammation. It is hypothesized that treatment of animals with resolvin D1 (RvD1) would reduce abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation by inhibiting NETosis.Wild-type 8- to 12-week-old C57BL/6 male mice (n = 47) and apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE) mice (n = 20) were used in two models to demonstrate the effects of RvD1 on AAA growth. In the topical elastase AAA model, wild-type mice were divided into three groups: a deactivated elastase control group, in which sham surgery was performed using deactivated elastase and mice were intravenously injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) once a day until harvest; an elastase group, in which active elastase was used to induce AAA and mice were injected with PBS daily until harvest; and an RvD1-treated group, in which AAA was induced and mice were injected with RvD1 daily until harvest. In the angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced AAA model, ApoE mice were fed a high- diet and implanted with osmotic infusion pumps containing Ang II (1000 ng/kg/min). The Ang II model was divided into two groups: an Ang II control group, in which Ang II was delivered and mice were injected with PBS daily until harvest; and an RvD1-treated group, in which Ang II was delivered and mice were injected with RvD1 daily until harvest. On postoperative day 3, day 14, or day 28, aortic and blood samples were collected for Western blot, histology, cytokine array, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and gelatin zymography after aortic diameter measurement.The day 14 RvD1-treated group demonstrated 42% reduced AAA diameter compared with the elastase group (P < .001). On postoperative day 3, the RvD1-treated group showed decreased levels of NETosis markers citrullinated histone H3 (P = .04) and neutrophil elastase (P = .002) compared with the elastase group. Among important cytokines involved in AAA formation, interleukin (IL) 1β was downregulated (P = .02) whereas IL-10, a protective cytokine, was upregulated (P = .01) in the RvD1-treated group. Active matrix metalloproteinase 2 also decreased in the RvD1-treated group (P = .03). The RvD1-treated group in the Ang II AAA model, a second model, demonstrated reduced AAA diameter compared with the Ang II control group on day 28 (P < .046). The RvD1-treated group showed decreased levels of citrullinated histone H3 on day 3 (P = .002). Cytokines interferon γ, IL-1β, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) were all decreased on day 28 (P < .05).RvD1-mediated inhibition of NETosis may represent a future medical treatment for the attenuation of AAA growth.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.
