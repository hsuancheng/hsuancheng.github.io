The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of diets supplemented with cooked red lentils on the colonic microenvironment (microbiota composition and activity and epithelial  integrity and ). C57Bl/6 male mice were fed one of five diets: a control basal diet (BD), a BD-supplemented diet with , 10 or 20% cooked red lentils (by weight), or a BD-supplemented diet with 0.7% pectin (equivalent soluble fiber level as found in the 20% lentil diet). Red lentil supplementation resulted in increased: (1) fecal microbiota α-diversity; (2) abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria (e.g.,  and ); (3) concentrations of fecal SCFAs; (4) mRNA expression of SCFA receptors (G-protein-coupled receptors () and tight/adherens junction proteins (Zona Occulden-1 (), Claudin-2, E-cadherin). Overall, 20% lentil had the greatest impact on colon health outcomes, which were in part explained by a change in the soluble and insoluble fiber profile of the diet. These results support recent public health recommendations to increase consumption of plant-based protein foods for improved health, in particular intestinal health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461548>Cosmetic benefits of a novel biomimetic lamellar formulation containing niacinamide in healthy females with oily, blemish-prone skin in a randomised proof-of-concept study.</a></h2><p>A randomised study was designed to evaluate the potential cosmetic benefit of a biomimetic, niacinamide-containing moisturising cream in oily, blemish-prone skin.Healthy adult women with oily, blemish-prone skin were randomised to one of three treatment groups: test, control, or positive control. In the test group, subjects used the test product (containing 4% niacinamide), plus the standard cleanser (Simple® Kind to Skin Moisturizing Facial Wash). In the control group, subjects received no moisturiser but used the standard cleanser. In the positive control group, subjects used Vivatinell Acnecinamide® Gel Cream (containing 4% niacinamide) as a moisturiser and Neutrogena Visibly Clear® Spot Clearing Facial Wash (containing 2% salicylic acid) as a cleanser. The positive control regimen was included to provide a comparison for estimates of effect size. The primary objective was to evaluate skin moisturisation as a change from baseline in corneometer values at 8 hours for the test regimen versus the control regimen. Analysis of covariance was applied for the primary efficacy analysis.A total of 132 subjects were randomised with 44 included in each treatment group. A significant difference was observed in the primary endpoint for the test regimen compared with the control regimen (least squares mean difference [95% CI]: 3.12 [0.68, .56], p=0.0128). A trend was observed in favour of the positive control regimen compared with the control regimen. Secondary measurements of moisturisation supported the primary efficacy outcome. Assessment of blemishes showed a significant difference between the test regimen versus the control regimen for change from baseline in mean total blemish count at Week 8 (least squares mean difference [95% CI]: -1.80 [-3.41, -0.19], p=0.0290). No statistical comparisons between the positive control group and the test group were performed.This study provides proof-of-concept evidence that a novel lamellar lipid moisturiser containing niacinamide, in combination with a standard cleanser, can help moisturise the skin and provide an overall improvement in the complexion appearance of people with blemish-prone skin..This article is protected by copyright.

In this study, we tested whether cotransplantation of fetal membranes (FMs) and allogeneic donor cells would improve the retention and  of allografts in mice.Intact and enzyme-digested membranes obtained from E18-E19 pregnant mice were subcutaneously cotransplanted with 10F7MN hybridoma cells that are of BALB/cByJ (Balb) origin and secrete anti-human CD235a antibody. Cells were transplanted into C57BL/6J (B6, allogeneic), Balb (syngeneic), and FVB/NJ (third-party) mice. Serum was collected after 1 and 3 weeks of cell transplantation and tested using flow cytometry for the presence of anti-human CD235a antibody. Immunosuppressive functions of membranes were further investigated by analyzing the cytokine profile of supernatants collected from allo-reactive mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLRs) using a multiplex cytokine assay.B6 mice transplanted with 10F7MN cells along with membranes syngeneic to the host had significantly higher levels of CD235a antibody when compared to B6 mice that received cells without membranes, allogenic membranes, or third-party membranes. Syngeneic membranes significantly inhibited T-cell proliferation in the presence of allogeneic stimuli and suppressed the release of Th1-cytokines such as IFNγ, TNFα, and IL-2 in MLRs. Additionally, increases in the levels of Th2-cytokines were found in MLRs containing membrane-derived cells.Our study highlights the potential use of syngeneic FMs to act as potent cell-carriers that could improve graft retention as well as graft-specific immunoprotection during allograft transplantation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659669>"It Sometimes Doesn't Even Work": Patient Opioid Assessments as Clues to Therapeutic Flexibility in Primary Care.</a></h2><p>Physicians' fear of difficult patient interactions is an important  to discontinuing long-term opioid therapy.To identify patient statements about opioids that indicate potential openness to tapering opioids or trying non-opioid pain treatments DESIGN: This is an observational study of regularly scheduled primary care visits involving discussion of chronic pain management. A coding system to characterize patient assessments about opioids, physician responses to assessments, and patient-endorsed opioid side effects was developed and applied to transcripts of video-recorded visits. All visits were independently coded by 2 authors.Eighty-six established adult patients taking opioids for chronic pain; 49 physicians in 2 academic primary care clinics MAIN MEASURES: Frequency and topic of patients' opioid assessments; proportion of opioid assessments classified as clues (assessments indicating potential willingness to consider non-opioid pain treatments or lower opioid doses); physician responses to patient clues; frequency and type of patient-endorsed side effects KEY RESULTS: Patients made a mean of 3.2 opioid assessments (median 2) per visit. The most common assessment topics were pain relief (51%), effect on  (21%), and opioid safety (14%). Forty-seven percent of opioid assessments (mean 1. per visit) were classified as clues. Fifty-three percent of visits included ≥ 1 clue; 21% of visits contained ≥ 3 clues. Physicians responded to patient clues with no/minimal response 43% of the time, sympathetic/empathetic statements 14% of the time, and further explored clues 43% of the time. Fifty-eight percent of patients endorsed ≥ 1 opioid-related side effect; 10% endorsed ≥ 3 side effects. The most commonly endorsed side effects were constipation (15% of patients), sedation (15%), withdrawal symptoms (13%), and nausea (12%).Patient statements suggesting openness to non-opioid pain treatments or lower opioid doses are common during routine primary care visits. Listening for and exploring these clues may be a patient-centered strategy for broaching difficult topics with patients on long-term opioid therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536969>Biomanufacturing of a novel <i>in vitro</i> biomimetic blood-brain  model.</a></h2><p>Glioma is a malignant tumor that severely threatens human health. However, it is difficult for most therapeutic agents to penetrate through the blood-brain  (BBB) and exhibit their antineoplastic activity in the brain. In this manuscript, a biomimetic in vitro BBB model was created by a composite process, this model can provide a significant foundation for the research of drug transport, tumor treatment, tumor microenvironment and other fields. A series of tests and comparative experiments were performed to evaluate this model. The tests showed that the model enabled preliminary simulation of the structure and  of the BBB. Experimental results demonstrated: 1) the new technology enabled controlled release of growth factors and successfully induced endothelial progenitor cells into endothelial cells. Compared with the traditional gold standard, the Transwell model, the expression of four specific proteins that are related to the BBB characteristics was significantly increased (alkaline phosphatase(ALP) by 89.82%, γ-GT by 88.86%, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) by 57.40%, and Claudin- by 102.32%) in this model; 2) Astrocytes had a promoting effect on the microvascular endothelial cells to form tight junction (ZO-1 increased by 249.35%, Claudin- increased by 184.99%), and there was a great difference between whether these two types of cells were contact cultured or not; 3) The gelatinous cell U118 had a destructive effect on the tight junction of BBB (ZO-1 decreased by 55.86%, Claudin- decreased by 37.84%).© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630422>NLRP Inflammasomes and Induced Skin Inflammation,  Recovery and Extended Skin Hydration.</a></h2><p>In vitro assays were designed to examine the release of active Caspase-1 (ACasp-1) from NLRP inflammasome-activated Normal Human Epidermal Keratinocytes (NHEK) employing a bioluminescent assay specific for measuring inflammasome-induced ACasp-1 expression.Four anticipated exogenous activators of the NLRP inflammasome including: UVB, ATP, Nigericin and Urban Dust were examined. Follow-up studies examined the influence of extracellular application of three different natural blends of known anti-inflammatories, one a polysaccharide blend, and the other two antioxidant blends, one oil-soluble the other water-soluble, to examine ACasp-1 inhibition. Clinical work using the same blend of polysaccharides employed at 3% in a moisturizing formulation was examined for skin  recovery, measured with TEWL over a 60 hour time frame after tape stripping on 10 individuals, and extended moisturization, measured using corneometer conductance after a single product application out through a 48-hour regression on 10 individuals.In vitro results indicated that two exogenous activators, 60 mJ/cm UVB and  mM ATP, worked to upregulate expression of ACasp-1 within a 20 hour timeframe. Additional studies were conducted to examine the influence of three xtracellularly applied active ingredient blends. A blend of polysaccharides demonstrated potential to inhibit ACasp-1 expression in both UVB- and ATP-activated skin cells. Oil-soluble and water-soluble antioxidant blends inhibited ACasp-1 expression in UVB-activated keratinocytes but not ATP-activated keratinocytes.  disruption studies indicated that 3% of the polysaccharide blend accelerated  recovery in a 60 hour time frame as measured by TEWL. Skin hydration studies showed an ability for the polysaccharide blend to show significant improvements in skin hydration out to 48 hours after a single application versus a moisturizing placebo.The role of the skin's innate immune response, controlled by NLRP inflammasomes, is beginning to be linked to numerous skin conditions including inflammaging. In this work it was found that: 1) an in vitro assay could activate NHEKs to express NLRP inflammasome-induced ACasp-1 expression, 2) Ingredient blends inhibited UVB and ATP-induced NLRP inflammasome-induced ACasp-1 expression, and 3) skin  disruption improvements and extended skin hydration could be achieved with 3% of the polysaccharide blend.© 2019 Society of Cosmetic Scientists and the Société Française de Cosmétologie.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664714>Protein Expression and Functional Relevance of Efflux and Uptake Drug Transporters at the Blood-Brain  of Human Brain and Glioblastoma.</a></h2><p>The knowledge of transporter protein expression and  at the human blood-brain  (BBB) is critical to prediction of drug BBB penetration and design of strategies for improving drug brain/brain tumor delivery. This study determined absolute transporter protein abundances in isolated microvessels of human normal brain (N=30), glioblastoma (N=47), rat (N=10) and mouse brain (N=10), and cell membranes of MDCKII cell lines, using targeted proteomics. In glioblastoma microvessels, ABCB1, ABCG2, MCT1, GLUT1, Na/K ATPase, and Claudin- protein levels were significantly reduced, while LAT1 was increased and GLU1 remained the same, as compared to human normal brain microvessels. ABCC4, OATP1A2, OATP2B1, and OAT3 were undetectable in microvessels of both human brain and glioblastoma. Species difference in BBB transporter abundances was noted. Cellular permeability experiments and modeling simulations suggested that not a single apical uptake transporter, but a vectorial transport system consisting of an apical uptake transporter and basolateral efflux mechanism was required for efficient delivery of poor transmembrane permeability drugs from the blood to brain.© 2019 The Authors Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics © 2019 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31358965>Dynamic polyhedral actomyosin lattices remodel micron-scale curved membranes during exocytosis in live mice.</a></h2><p>Actomyosin networks, the cell's major force production machineries, remodel cellular membranes during myriad dynamic processes by assembling into various architectures with distinct force generation properties. While linear and branched actomyosin architectures are well characterized in cell-culture and cell-free systems, it is not known how actin and myosin networks form and  to remodel membranes in complex three-dimensional mammalian tissues. Here, we use four-dimensional spinning-disc confocal microscopy with image deconvolution to acquire macromolecular-scale detail of dynamic actomyosin networks in exocrine glands of live mice. We address how actin and myosin organize around large membrane-bound secretory vesicles and generate the forces required to complete exocytosis. We find that actin and non-muscle myosin II (NMII) assemble into previously undescribed polyhedral-like lattices around the vesicle membrane. The NMII lattice comprises bipolar minifilaments as well as non-canonical three-legged configurations. Using photobleaching and pharmacological perturbations in vivo, we show that actomyosin contractility and actin polymerization together push on the underlying vesicle membrane to overcome the energy  and complete exocytosis. Our imaging approach thus unveils a force-generating actomyosin lattice that regulates secretion in the exocrine organs of live animals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609077>Efficacy of anti-inflammatory moisturizer vs hydrophilic cream in elderly patients with moderate to severe xerosis: A split site, triple-blinded, randomized, controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Xerosis is a common problem among the elderly, characterized by dry-scaling erythema, fissuring, or pruritus, which could be treated by anti-inflammatory moisturizers without side effects of steroids.We aimed to investigate the efficacy of anti-inflammatory moisturizer (MAS062D lotion) vs hydrophilic cream for the improvement of dry and   skin in xerosis patients.A split site, triple-blinded, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in the elderly with moderate to severe xerosis, who received the 28-day twice daily application of MAS062D lotion and hydrophilic cream on the assigned shins. The evaluations on day 0, 14, and 28 were performed using clinical assessment, skin hydration by corneometer, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and biometric assessment.There were 24 Thai elderly patients, of whom 87.% were female (mean age = 58.04 years and mean xerosis severity scale (XSS) = 4.83). Both treatments revealed similar statistically significant improvement in XSS (P < .001). Interestingly, MAS062D lotion-treated side remarkably showed improvement of skin hydration compared with hydrophilic-treated side for 26.86 ± 7.94 vs 25.84 ± .1, 41.24 ± 6.92 vs 20.96 ± 6.8, 50.49 ± 8.2 vs 21.75 ± 8.29 at baseline, day 14, and 28, respectively (P-value < .001). Moreover, MAS062D lotion significantly yielded greater decrease in TEWL measurement and more erythema improvement than hydrophilic cream (P-value < .001). No serious adverse effects were observed with either treatment.The MAS062D lotion could potentially be an efficacious treatment for improvement of xerosis in the elderly, which is also safe and refrains from steroid side effects.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559607>Pharmacogenetics of Atremorine-Induced Neuroprotection and Dopamine Response in Parkinson's Disease.</a></h2><p>Atremorine is a novel bioproduct with neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic neurons and a natural L-DOPA donor in Parkinson's disease (PD). In the present study, we show the effects of a single dose of Atremorine ( g, p. o.) on plasma dopamine (DA) response and brain  in PD (n = 183) and the influence that pathogenic (), metabolic (), transporter (), pleiotropic (), and detoxifying genes () involved in the pharmacogenetic network exerts on Atremorine-induced DA response. Over 90% of PD patients at diagnosis show plasma DA levels below 20 pg/mL. Atremorine induces DA synthesis causing a significant increase in plasma DA levels 1 h after administration in practically 100% of patients. Females tend to show lower basal DA levels than males and the response of DA to Atremorine is stronger in males than in females. Atremorine-induced DA response is pharmacogenotype-specific and lasts from 6 - 12 h depending upon the pharmacogenetic profile of each patient. Genetic variants in pathogenic genes, metabolic genes, and genes involved in the detoxification processes affect the response of DA to Atremorine in a genotype-specific manner.

Administration of probiotics and prebiotics has been proposed as a convenient and effective treatment. Our study aims to evaluate the therapeutic benefits of  N1115 (N1115) and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) by examining the histopathogenesis and underlying molecular events of NAFLD.An NAFLD mouse model was established by feeding C57BL/6 mice with a high-fat diet (HFD). N1115, FOS and synbiotics were administered for 16 weeks.N1115, FOS and synbiotics alleviated HFD-induced hepatic steato-sis and release of tumor necrosis factor-α, and slowed the progression of cirrhosis. Compared to the HFD group, these dietary supplements reduced serum total triglyceride and cholesterol, and appeared to decrease the fasting blood glucose and insulin. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and real-time PCR showed that the regimens could overcome insulin resistance. These findings were associated with the transcriptional repression of inflammatory factors such as lipopolysaccharides, Toll-like receptor 4 and nuclear factor-κB. Lastly, N1115, FOS, and synbiotics improved the intestinal  functions and histologic integrity. This was accompanied by the restoration of the p38 MAPK pathway and in-creased expression of the tight junction components occludin-1 and claudin-1.N1115, FOS and synbiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.

Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) preserves Sdc1 and reduces permeability following HS, although the key mediators remain unknown. Antithrombin III (ATIII) is a plasma protein with potent anti-inflammatory and endothelial protective activity. We hypothesized that the protective effects of FFP on endothelial Sdc1 and permeability are mediated, in part, through ATIII.ATIII and Sdc1 were measured in severely injured patients upon admission (N = 125) and hospital day 3 (N = 90) for correlation analysis. In vitro effects of ATIII on human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs) were determined by pre-treating cells with vehicle, FFP, ATIII-deficient FFP, or purified ATIII followed by TNFα stimulation. Sdc1 expression was measured by immunostaining and permeability by electrical impedance. To determine the role of ATIII in vivo, male mice were subjected to a fixed pressure exsanguination model of HS, followed by resuscitation with FFP, ATIII-deficient FFP, or ATIII-deficient FFP with ATIII repletion. Lung Sdc1 expression was assessed by immunostaining.Pearson correlation analysis showed a significant negative correlation between plasma levels of Sdc1 and ATIII (R = -0.62; p < 0.0001) in injured patients on hospital day 3. Also, in vitro, FFP and ATIII prevented TNFα-induced permeability (p < 0.05 vs TNFα) in HLMVECs. ATIII-deficient FFP had no effect; however, ATIII restoration reestablished its protective effects in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, FFP and ATIII prevented TNFα-induced Sdc1 shedding in HLMVECs, however ATIII-deficient FFP did not. In mice, Sdc1 expression was increased following FFP resuscitation (1.7 ± 0., p < 0.01) vs. HS alone (1.0 ± 0.3), however, no improvement was seen following ATIII-deficient FFP treatment (1.3 ± 0.4, p = 0.3). ATIII restoration improved Sdc1 expression (1. ± 0.9, p < 0.05) similar to that of FFP resuscitation.ATIII plays a role in FFP-mediated protection of endothelial Sdc1 expression and  , making it a potential therapeutic target to mitigate HS-induced endothelial dysfunction.

However, effective therapeutic options for severe, acute radiation-induced skin reactions are limited. Although platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is known to improve cutaneous wound healing, its effects in the context of high-dose irradiation are still poorly understood.We investigated the regenerative functions of PRP by subjecting the dorsal skin of mice to local irradiation (40 Gy) and exposing HaCaT cells to gamma rays ( Gy). The cutaneous benefits of PRP were gauged by wound size, histologic features, immunostains, western blot, and transepithelial water loss (TEWL). To assess the molecular effects of PRP on keratinocytes of healing radiation-induced wounds, we evaluated AKT signaling.Heightened expression of keratin 14 (K14) was documented in irradiated HaCaT cells and skin tissue, although the healing capacity of injured HaCaT cells declined. By applying PRP, this capacity was restored via augmented AKT signaling. In our mouse model, PRP use achieved the following: (1) healing of desquamated skin, acutely injured by radiation; (2) activated AKT signaling, improving migration and proliferation of K14 cells; (3) greater expression of involucrin in keratin 10 cells and sebaceous glands; and (4) reduced TEWL, strengthening the cutaneous  .Our findings indicate that PRP enhances the functions of K14 cells via AKT signaling, accelerating the regeneration of irradiated skin.

However, their sphere-like geometry prevents access to the apical side of the epithelium, making them unsuitable for standard functional assays designed for flat cell monolayers. Here, we describe a simple method for the formation of epithelial monolayers that recapitulates the in vivo-like cell type composition and organization and that is suitable for functional tissue  assays. In our approach, epithelial monolayer spreading is driven by the substrate stiffness, while tissue   is achieved by the basolateral delivery of medium enriched with stem cell niche and myofibroblast-derived factors. These monolayers contain major intestinal epithelial cell types organized into proliferating crypt-like domains and differentiated villus-like regions, closely resembling the in vivo cell distribution. As a unique characteristic, these epithelial monolayers form functional epithelial barriers with an accessible apical surface and physiologically relevant transepithelial electrical resistance values.

In previous work we observed an effect of micronutrients on villus height (VH).We aimed to determine, in a randomized controlled trial, if amino acid (AA) or multiple micronutrient (MM) supplementation can improve intestinal structure or  dysfunction in Zambian adults with EE.AA (tryptophan, leucine, and glutamine) and/or MM supplements were given for 16 wk in a 2 × 2 factorial comparison against placebo. Primary outcomes were changes in VH, in vivo small intestinal  dysfunction assessed by confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE), and mechanistic (or mammalian) target of rapamycin complex 1 (MTORC1) nutrient responsiveness in lamina propria CD4+ lymphocytes.Over 16 wk AA, but not MM, supplementation increased VH by 16% (34. μm) compared with placebo (P = 0.04). Fluorescein leak, measured by CLE, improved only in those allocated to both AA and MM supplementation. No effect was seen on MTORC1 activation, but posttreatment MTORC1 and VH were correlated (ρ = 0.51; P = 0.001), and change in MTORC1 was correlated with change in VH in the placebo group (ρ = 0.63; P = 0.03). In secondary analyses no effect was observed on biomarkers of microbial translocation. Metabolomic analyses suggest alterations in a number of microbial- and host-derived metabolites including the leucine metabolite β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate, which was increased by AA supplementation and correlated with VH.In this phase 2 trial, AA supplementation protected against a decline in VH over the supplementation period, and improved   when combined with micronutrients.

Participants had healthy skin of the buttocks, perineal, and perigenital areas and were not incontinent of urine or stool. The study was conducted at a contracted clinical research facility in Southeastern United States.Four hundred milliliters of synthetic urine was distributed across the width of a premium incontinence pad with wicking technology containing a superabsorbent polymer core. Participants laid supine for a total of 4 hours, with the wet pad under the buttocks. Skin assessments were conducted at baseline prior to contact with the wet pad, at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1, 2, and 4 hours after exposure to the synthetic urine. Outcome measures were skin moisture content, cutaneous pH, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), mean coefficient of friction values (static and dynamic), and tolerability evaluations (expert clinical grader-assessed erythema and participant-assessed discomfort).Mean moisture content of the skin increased from 46.19 ± 22.1 to 1845.28 ± 542.7 micro-Siemens (μS) after just 15 minutes of exposure and was significantly increased at all time points compared to baseline (P < .001). Cutaneous pH increased from .67 ± 0. to 6.25 ± 0.1 after 15 minutes; pH was higher at all time points compared to baseline (P < .001). Passive transfer of water through the stratum corneum (TEWL) showed an increase from 9.02 ± 2.2 g/m/h at baseline to 16.83 ± .2 g/m/h at 4 hours (P < .001). There was a significant increase from baseline to 4 hours in mean coefficient of static friction (0.32 ± 0.01 vs 0.47 ± 0.03; P < .00001) as well as mean coefficient of dynamic friction (0.29 ± 0.01 vs 0.42 ± 0.02; P < .00001). There was a significant increase in erythema and an increase in participant-assessed discomfort at all time points (P < .005).Our findings suggest that impairment of the skin's epithelial-moisture   associated with inflammation and development of incontinence-associated dermatitis begins rapidly after an incontinence event, even with the use of a premium pad with wicking technology.

State-of-the-art therapeutic approaches focus on alleviating the symptoms of this disease by non-invasive and simple-to-use methods. Nasal irrigation is one of the most accepted approaches to ease nasal congestion which, if left untreated, has a negative impact on the quality of life of patients.In this study, the safety and efficacy of a novel hypertonic seawater solution for nasal lavage enriched with hyaluronic acids, eucalyptus oil, copper, and manganese salts (Stérimar Stop & Protect Cold and Flu; SSPCF) have been investigated in vitro.An in vitro 3D reconstituted human nasal epithelium tissue model, MucilAir™, has been used in this study to investigate the safety of SSPCF on nasal epithelium by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion. The efficacy of SSPCF was measured by mucociliary clearance (MCC), ATP release, Alcian blue and aquaporin (AQP3) stainings.SSPCF treatment respected nasal epithelium tissue integrity and enhanced   without inducing a cytotoxic response. Secreted LDH and IL-8 levels were similar to untreated controls. MCC rate was increased 2.-fold and ATP release decreased 87% upon SSPCF treatment, indicating improved decongestion activity. SSPCF treatment after hypotonic stress helped recover cellular organization, as shown by Alcian blue and AQP3 staining assays.SSPCF appears as a safe and effective nasal irrigation formula that may alleviate the symptoms associated with common cold such as nasal congestion.© 2019 Huang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593118>Age-specific reference values for cerebrospinal fluid protein concentrations in children in southern China.</a></h2><p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein values decline over the first few months of life as the infant's blood-CSF  matures. However, published studies have not reported CSF protein reference values of Chinese infants and differ in the reported rate, timing, and magnitude of this decline. The objective of this study was to determine reference intervals for CSF protein using available data of children in southern China. This retrospective study included infants who had a lumbar puncture (LP) performed in the Department of Pediatrics of Southern Medical University Affiliated Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Foshan of an urban tertiary care children's hospital between January 1, 2008 and May 31, 2018. Infants with conditions suspected or known to cause elevated CSF protein concentrations were excluded. Of 3712 infants undergoing LP, 1043 (28.1%) met inclusion criteria. Results showed that there is an age-related decline in CSF protein concentration. The median CSF protein value was 62 mg/dL [interquartile range (IQR): 47-81 mg/dL] in infants aged 0 to 56 days (group 1). The 95th percentile values were 116 mg/dL for infants 0 to 28 days and 80 mg/dL for infants 29 to 56 days. The 95th percentile values by age category were as follows: ages 0 to 14 days, 117 mg/dL; ages 15 to 28 days, 107 mg/dL; ages 29 to 42 days, 96 mg/dL; and ages 43 to 56 days, 74 mg/dL. The median CSF protein value was 21 mg/dL (IQR: 16-31 mg/dL) in infants aged 2 months to <3 years (group 2). The 95th percentile values were 57 mg/dL for infants 2 to <6 months and 34 mg/dL for infants 6 to ≤24 months. The 95th percentile values by age category were as follows: ages 2 to <3 months, 66 mg/dL; ages 3 to <4 months, 52 mg/dL; ages 4 to < months, 53 mg/dL; and ages  to <6 months, 42 mg/dL. We quantify the age-related decline in CSF protein concentrations among infants 2 years of age and younger and provide age-specific reference values. The values reported here can be used to interpret the results of LP in infants ≤2 years of age.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520476>Paneth cell dysfunction mediates alcoholic steatohepatitis through promoting bacterial translocation in mice: role of zinc deficiency.</a></h2><p>Microbial dysbiosis is associated with alcoholic hepatitis (AH) with the mechanisms yet to be elucidated. The present study aimed to determine the effects of alcohol and zinc deficiency on Paneth cell (PC) antimicrobial peptides - α-defensins, and to define the link between PC dysfunction and AH. Translocation of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) was determined in patients with severe AH and in a mouse model of alcoholic liver disease. Microbial composition and PC  were examined in mice. The link between α-defensin dysfunction and AH was investigated in α-defensin deficient mice. Synthetic human α-defensin  (HD5) was orally given to the alcohol-fed mice to test the therapeutic potential. The role of zinc deficiency in α-defensin was evaluated in acute and chronic mouse models of zinc deprivation. Hepatic inflammation was associated with PAMP translocation, and lipocalin-2 (LCN2) and CXCL1 elevation in AH patients. Antibiotic treatment, lipopolysaccharide injection to mice, and in vitro experiments showed that PAMPs, but not alcohol, directly induced LCN2 and CXCL1. Chronic alcohol feeding caused systemic dysbiosis and PC α-defensin reduction in mice. Knockout of functional α-defensins synergistically affected alcohol-perturbed bacterial composition and gut , and exaggerated PAMP translocation and liver damage. Administration of HD5 effectively altered cecal microbial composition, especially increased Akkermansia muciniphila, and reversed alcohol-induced deleterious effects. Zinc regulated PC homeostasis and α-defensins  at multiple levels, and dietary zinc deficiency exaggerated the deleterious effect of alcohol on PC bactericidal activity CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the study suggests that alcohol-induced PC α-defensin dysfunction is mediated by zinc deficiency and involved in the pathogenesis of AH. HD5 administration may represent a novel and promising therapeutic approach for treating AH.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589828>The Roles of Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 13 in Spinal Cord Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in Rats.</a></h2><p>Spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury (SCII) remains an unresolved complication and its underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we studied the role of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 13 (CXCL13) in a rat model of SCII. We examined the time course and cellular distribution of CXCL13 protein in rats after SCII. The effects of siRNA targeting CXCL13 or C-X-C chemokine receptor type  (CXCR5) in SCII were also investigated. Neurological , histological assessment, and disruption of the blood-spinal cord  (BSCB) were evaluated. The expression levels of CXCL13, CXCR5, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), caspase-3, interleukin 6 (IL-6), TNF-α, and IL-1β were determined. We found that SCII resulted in impaired hind limb  and increased the expression of CXCL13. In addition, CXCL13 expression demonstrated the most pronounced effect at 24 h after SCII. We reveal that CXCL13 protein was co-expressed with the mature neuron marker NeuN and the microglial marker IBA-1 in spinal cord tissues of model rats. SCII also increased the expression of CXCR5, p-ERK, caspase-3, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β at 24 h after SCII. Pre-treatment with CXCL13 siRNA protected the rats against SCII and decreased the expression of signalling pathway proteins and proinflammatory cytokines mentioned above. CXCR5 siRNA also showed similar protective effects. These findings indicate that CXCL13 is involved in SCII. The CXCL13/CXCR5 axis promotes the development of SCII, possibly via ERK-mediated pathways. Targeting the mechanism of CXCL13 involved in the development of SCII might be a potential approach for the treatment of this condition.Copyright © 2019.

While each has been implicated in mediating sepsis mortality, the relationship between these two processes is unclear. We hypothesized that preventing intestinal apoptosis would prevent gut  dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, transgenic mice that overexpress the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in the gut epithelium (Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice) and wild type (WT) mice were subjected to sham laparotomy or cecal ligation and puncture and orally gavaged with fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated-dextran (FD-4) five hours before sacrifice. Serum FD-4 concentration was assayed to measure intestinal permeability, and jejunal tight junctions were assayed for mRNA and protein expression. Baseline FD-4 concentration was similar between WT and Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice. Intestinal permeability increased 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours following sepsis in WT mice; however, FD-4 concentration was significantly lower at each timepoint in Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice. In addition, there were no statistically significant changes in permeability between septic and sham transgenic mice. Intestinal mRNA expression of claudin 3, claudin  and occludin were lower in septic Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice while claudin 4 mRNA levels were higher in Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice. In contrast, no differences were detected in claudins 2, 7, 15, JAM-A or ZO-1. Protein levels followed the same trend for all tight junction mediators different between WT and Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice except occludin was significantly higher in transgenic mice. Together these results demonstrate that decreasing intestinal epithelial apoptosis prevents hyperpermeability following sepsis via tight junction alterations which may be at least partially responsible for improved survival conferred by Bcl-2 overexpression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31379610>Pinocembrin Protects Against Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Rats Colitis by Ameliorating Inflammation, Improving   and Modulating Gut Microbiota.</a></h2><p>Pinocembrin (PIN) is a natural flavonoid widely found in bee propolis with potent gastrointestinal protective effects. In consequence, PIN has great potential in preventing inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) while scant information is available. In this study, a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced rats ulcerative colitis model (3.% DSS in drinking water for 7 days) was applied to explore the protective effects of PIN on macroscopic colitis symptoms, inflammation, intestinal epithelial  , and gut microbiota homeostasis. While DSS-treated rats showed severe colitis clinical symptoms and histological changes (colonic pathological damages and intestinal goblet cells loss), pre-administration of PIN ( and 10 mg/kg, ) for a week alleviated these symptoms. Pre-administration of PIN also suppressed the pro-inflammatory gene expressions and improved tight junction functions of colonic epithelial cells. Additionally, PIN administration reversed DSS-induced short chain fatty acid loss, and improved the gut microbial diversity assessed by 16S rRNA phylogenetic sequencing. Overall, our results suggest a wide spectrum of protective effects of PIN in preventing IBDs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31527523>Animal Models of Undernutrition and Enteropathy as Tools for Assessment of Nutritional Intervention.</a></h2><p> Undernutrition is a major public health problem leading to 1 in  of all deaths in children under  years. Undernutrition leads to growth stunting and/or wasting and is often associated with environmental enteric dysfunction (EED). EED mechanisms leading to growth failure include intestinal hyperpermeability, villus blunting, malabsorption and gut inflammation. As non-invasive methods for investigating gut  in undernourished children are limited, pre-clinical models are relevant to elucidating the pathophysiological processes involved in undernutrition and EED, and to identifying novel therapeutic strategies. In many published models, undernutrition was induced using protein or micronutrient deficient diets, but these experimental models were not associated with EED. Enteropathy models mainly used gastrointestinal injury triggers. These models are presented in this review. We found only a few studies investigating the combination of undernutrition and enteropathy. This highlights the need for further developments to establish an experimental model reproducing the impact of undernutrition and enteropathy on growth, intestinal hyperpermeability and inflammation, that could be suitable for preclinical evaluation of innovative therapeutic intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31405972>Upregulation of reduced folate carrier by vitamin D enhances brain folate uptake in mice lacking folate receptor alpha.</a></h2><p>Folates are critical for central nervous system . Folate transport is mediated by 3 major pathways, reduced folate carrier (RFC), proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT), and folate receptor alpha (FRα/Folr1), known to be regulated by ligand-activated nuclear receptors. Cerebral folate delivery primarily occurs at the choroid plexus through FRα and PCFT; inactivation of these transport systems can result in very low folate levels in the cerebrospinal fluid causing childhood neurodegenerative disorders. These disorders have devastating effects in young children, and current therapeutic approaches are not sufficiently effective. Our group has previously reported in vitro that functional expression of RFC at the blood-brain  (BBB) and its upregulation by the vitamin D nuclear receptor (VDR) could provide an alternative route for brain folate uptake. In this study, we further demonstrated in vivo, using Folr1 knockout (KO) mice, that loss of FRα led to a substantial decrease of folate delivery to the brain and that pretreatment of Folr1 KO mice with the VDR activating ligand, calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D), resulted in over a 6-fold increase in [C]--formyltetrahydrofolate ([C]--formylTHF) concentration in brain tissues, with levels comparable to wild-type animals. Brain-to-plasma concentration ratio of [C]--formylTHF was also significantly higher in calcitriol-treated Folr1 KO mice (15-fold), indicating a remarkable enhancement in brain folate delivery. These findings demonstrate that augmenting RFC functional expression at the BBB could effectively compensate for the loss of Folr1-mediated folate uptake at the choroid plexus, providing a therapeutic approach for neurometabolic disorders caused by defective brain folate transport.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31282475>LAT1 (SLC7A5) and CD98hc (SLC3A2) complex dynamics revealed by single-particle cryo-EM.</a></h2><p>Solute carriers are a large class of transporters that play key roles in normal and disease . Among the solute carriers, heteromeric amino-acid transporters (HATs) are unique in their quaternary structure. LAT1-CD98hc, a HAT, transports essential amino acids and drugs across the blood-brain  and into cancer cells. It is therefore an important target both biologically and therapeutically. During the course of this work, cryo-EM structures of LAT1-CD98hc in the inward-facing conformation and in either the substrate-bound or apo states were reported to 3.3-3. Å resolution [Yan et al.

Here, these structures are analyzed together with our lower resolution cryo-EM structure, and multibody 3D auto-refinement against single-particle cryo-EM data was used to characterize the dynamics of the interaction of CD98hc and LAT1. It is shown that the CD98hc ectodomain and the LAT1 extracellular surface share no substantial interface. This allows the CD98hc ectodomain to have a high degree of movement within the extracellular space. The functional implications of these aspects are discussed together with the structure determination.open access.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297722>The effect of moderate-dose aflatoxin B and Salmonella Enteritidis infection on intestinal permeability in broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>The effect of dietary aflatoxin B (AFB) and Salmonella Enteritidis infection on intestinal permeability was investigated.

Enteritidis per bird at 18 days old; AF + SE, chickens fed an AFB-contaminated diet and challenged with 10 cfu of S. Enteritidis per bird at 18 days old. At day 21 of age, chicks received an oral gavage dose of fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-dextran) to evaluate gastrointestinal leakage. Blood and intestinal samples were collected to evaluate serum biochemistry and total intestinal IgA secretion, respectively. Liver tissues were aseptically collected to assess bacterial invasiveness and for histomorphological studies. The results showed that chickens receiving AFB presented a significant increment (up to 2.4-fold) in serum FITC-dextran concentration (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, S. Enteritidis infection had no additional effect on gastrointestinal leakage. Furthermore, the ingestion of AFB had no impact on the invasive potential of S. Enteritidis.

The traced ISF from the caudate nucleus drained to the ipsilateral cortex along myelin fiber tracts, while in the opposite direction, its movement to the adjacent thalamus was completely impeded by a  structure, which was identified as the converged, compact myelin fascicle. The regulating and the  effects of myelin were unchanged in AQP4-knockout rats but were impaired as the integrity of boundary structure of drainage system was destroyed in a demyelinated rat model. We thus proposed that the brain homeostasis was maintained within each ISF drainage division locally, rather than across the brain as a whole. A new brain division system and a new pathogenic mechanism of demyelination are therefore proposed.Copyright: © 2019 Wang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31273117>Proton uptake mechanism in bacteriorhodopsin captured by serial synchrotron crystallography.</a></h2><p>Conformational dynamics are essential for proteins to .

From 10 to 15 milliseconds onwards, we observe large additional structural rearrangements up to 9 angstroms on the cytoplasmic side.

Herein, we reported that the SnO quantum dots (QDs) supported on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) could efficiently and stably catalyze NRR at ambient conditions. The NRR performance of resulting SnO/RGO was studied by both experimental techniques and density functional theory calculations. It was found that the ultrasmall SnO QDs (2 nm) grown on RGO could provide abundant sites for efficient N adsorption. Significantly, the strongly electronically coupled SnO QDs and RGO brought about the enhanced conductivity and the decreased work , which led to a considerably lowered energy  of *N → *NH that was the rate-determining step of the NRR process. Meanwhile, the SnO/RGO exhibited inferior hydrogen evolution reaction activity. As a result, the SnO/RGO delivered a high NH yield of 25.6 μg h mg (.1 μg cmh) and an FE of 7.1% in 0.1 M NaSO at -0.

Broncho-Vaxom (BV), as a probiotic, has been applied to patients suffering from respiratory tract infections, but its potential effectiveness in allergic rhinitis (AR) has not been evaluated in human. This study aimed to investigate the clinical efficacy of BV in patients with persistent AR and to elucidate the underlying cellular mechanisms.Sixty patients with AR were enrolled to this study and were randomly assigned to the BV group (n=30) and the placebo group (n=30). Changes of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters of allergic inflammation were measured at baseline visit, immediately after BV treatment, four weeks, and eight weeks after the BV treatment.After BV treatment, medication score in the BV group was significantly decreased compared with placebo group, along with a significant drop of the total nasal symptom score and the individual nasal symptom scores (itching score: 23.72±.32%; nasal rhinorrhea score: 18.59±4.83%; sneezing score: 23.08±4.98%). The levels of IL-4 and IL-13 in nasal lavage were diminished remarkably while the level of INF-γ was markedly increased in the BV group. This rendered a significant reduction of the ratio of IL-4/INF-γ. Moreover, a decrease of eosinophils in nasal smear was observed after BV treatment. The BV-induced favorable changes sustained for at least four to eight weeks post BV treatment.Oral administration of BV offers remarkable and sustained efficacy in alleviating AR symptoms and may be considered as an alternative therapeutic strategy for patients with persistent AR.

The MCC (membrane compartment of Can1) is an evolutionarily conserved ergosterol-rich plasma membrane domain. It is stabilized on its cytosolic face by the eisosome, a hemitubular protein complex composed of  (BAR) domain-containing Pil1 and Lsp1. These two proteins bind directly to phosphatidylinositol 4,-bisphosphate and promote the typical furrow-like shape of the microdomain, with highly curved edges and bottom. While some proteins display stable localization in the MCC/eisosome, others enter or leave it under particular conditions, such as misbalance in membrane lipid composition, changes in membrane tension, or availability of specific nutrients. These findings reveal that the MCC/eisosome, a plasma membrane microdomain with distinct morphology and lipid composition, acts as a multifaceted regulator of various cellular processes including metabolic pathways, cellular morphogenesis, signalling cascades, and mRNA decay. In this minireview, we focus on the MCC/eisosome's proposed role in the regulation of lipid metabolism.

This work tried to elucidate whether GLP-1, GLP-2 and EGF can affect the EB of the rumen. Ovine ruminal epithelia were incubated in Ussing chambers for 7 hr with 25 or 250 nM of either GLP-1 or GLP-2 on the serosal side, with 2. nM of EGF on the serosal side or with 0.25 or 2. nM EGF on the mucosal side. No treatment affected tissue conductance. Short-circuit current (I ) was affected by time and treatment and their interactions. Only 250 nM of either GLP-1 or GLP-2 decreased I in certain periods compared with 25 nM GLP-1 or 0.25 nM mucosally applied EGF; however, not when compared to control epithelia. Fluorescein flux rates (J ) of ruminal epithelia were affected by treatment, time and time × treatment interaction. The time × treatment interaction was based on an increase in J between the first and last hour in epithelia incubated with 25 nM GLP-1 or GLP-2 and in epithelia incubated with EGF. After 7 hr incubation, claudin-7 mRNA expression was downregulated in all treatments. Claudin-1 mRNA was upregulated after incubation with 2. nM EGF on the serosal side, claudin-4 mRNA was downregulated by 2. nM EGF on the mucosal side, and occludin mRNA was increased after incubation with 250 nM GLP-2. The protein abundance of all tested TJ proteins was not influenced by treatment. We conclude that GLP-1, GLP-2, and EGF have no obvious acute effects on the EB of ruminal epithelia under simulated physiological conditions ex vivo. However, by decreasing the mRNA expression of claudin-7 and partly affecting other TJ proteins, they may modulate EB in the longer term or under certain conditions.© 2019 The Authors.

The Kaplan-Meier curves for survival time were produced and compared with the Log-rank test and Wilcoxon (Gehan) χ. Differential mRNA-seq combined with network pharmacology was used to disclose the network effect mechanism of LTP on AICH, and the obtained differential genes were mapped into the predictive empirical compound-target network model (ECT network model) and the empirical compound-target-pathogenesis (disease) network model (ECTP network model).The median survival time of four different doses of LTP-treated groups (0.00 g/kg, .78 g/kg, 11.55 g/kg, 23.10 g/kg) for adult AICH rats by 0.18 U collagenase was 14 h, 37 h, 150 h, and 51 h respectively, and the 7-day survival rates were 33.3%, 41.7%, 50.0%, and 38.%, of which the medium-dose group (MD) had a longer survival time and higher survival rate.

The present study not only provides a new explanation for the 'multi-component, multi-target, multi-pathway' effects of the LTP on AICH but also screened out some major compounds of LTP and their potential targets which will facilitate the development of new drugs for AICH.Copyright © 2019.

We postulate that the tight junction protein claudin-19 is expressed in IMCD and that it takes part in epithelial adaptation to changing osmolality at different functional states. Presence of claudin-19 in rat IMCD was investigated by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Primary cell culture of rat IMCD cells on permeable filter supports was performed under different osmotic culture conditions and after stimulation by antidiuretic hormone (AVP). Electrogenic transepithelial transport properties were measured in Ussing chambers. IMCD cells cultivated at 300 mosm/kg showed high transepithelial resistance, a cation selective paracellular pathway and claudin-19 was mainly located in the tight junction. Treatment by AVP increased cation selectivity but did not alter transepithelial resistance or claudin-19 subcellular localization. In contrast, IMCD cells cultivated at 900 mosm/kg had low transepithelial resistance, anion selectivity, and claudin-19 was relocated from the tight junctions to intracellular vesicles.

Next-generation sequencing was used for analyzing the composition of microbiota in caecum. Concentration of short chain fatty acids were determined by GC-MS. The  reinforcing tight junction proteins zonula occludens-2 (ZO-2), claudin-1 and NOD like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation were determined by Western blot. The proportion of CD25Foxp3CD4 regulatory T cell (Foxp3 Treg) in the pancreas, pancreatic and mesenteric lymph nodes was analyzed by flow cytometry. We found that LMP supplementation ameliorated T1D development in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, as evidenced by decreasing diabetes incidence and fasting glucose levels in LMP fed NOD mice. Further microbiota analysis revealed that LMP supplementation prevented T1D-associated caecal dysbiosis and selectively enriched caecal bacterial species to produce more SCFAs. The LMP-mediated microbial balance further enhanced caecal   and shaped gut-pancreatic immune environment, as characterized by higher expression of tight junction proteins claudin-1, ZO-2 in caecum, increased Foxp3 Treg population and decreased NLRP3 inflammasome activation in both caecum and pancreas. The microbiota-dependent beneficial effect of LMP on T1D was further proven by the fact that aberration of caecal microbiota by ABX treatment worsened T1D autoimmunity and could be restored with transfer of feces of LMP-fed NOD mice. These data demonstrate that this novel LMP limits T1D development by inducing caecal homeostasis to shape pancreatic immune environment. This finding opens a realistic option for gut microbiota manipulation and prevention of T1D in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31330229>Methylmercury exposure induces ROS/Akt inactivation-triggered endoplasmic reticulum stress-regulated neuronal cell apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological studies have positively linked mercury exposure and neurodegenerative diseases (ND). Methylmercury (MeHg), an organic form of mercury, is a ubiquitous and potent environmental neurotoxicant that easily crosses the blood-brain  and causes irreversible injury to the central nervous system (CNS). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying MeHg-induced neurotoxicity remain unclear. Here, the present study found that Neuro-2a cells underwent apoptosis in response to MeHg (1- μM), which was accompanied by increased phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure on the outer cellular membrane leaflets, caspase-3 activity, and the activation of caspase cascades and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Exposure of Neuro-2a cells to MeHg also triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which was identified via several key molecules (including: glucose-regulated protein (GRP)78, GRP94, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) X-box binding protein(XBP)-1, protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK), eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), inositol-requiring enzyme(IRE)-1, activation transcription factor(AFT)4, and ATF6. Transfection with GRP78-, GRP94-, CHOP-, and XBP-1-specific small interfering (si)RNA significantly suppressed the expression of these proteins, and attenuated cytotoxicity and caspase-12, -7, and -3 activation in MeHg-exposed cells. Furthermore, MeHg dramatically decreased Akt phosphorylation, and the overexpression of activation of Akt1 (myr-Akt1) could significantly prevent MeHg-induced Akt inactivation, as well as apoptotic and ER stress-related signals. Pretreatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) effectively prevented MeHg-induced neuronal cell reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, apoptotic and ER stress-related signals, and Akt inactivation. Collectively, these results indicate that MeHg exerts its cytotoxicity in neurons by inducing ROS-mediated Akt inactivation up-regulated ER stress, which induces apoptosis and ultimately leads to cell death.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The gut microbiome is a crucial modulator of visceral pain, whereas recent evidence suggests that gut microbiota may also play a critical role in many other types of chronic pain, including inflammatory pain, headache, neuropathic pain, and opioid tolerance. We present a narrative review of the current understanding on the role of gut microbiota in pain regulation and discuss the possibility of targeting gut microbiota for the management of chronic pain. Numerous signalling molecules derived from gut microbiota, such as by-products of microbiota, metabolites, neurotransmitters, and neuromodulators, act on their receptors and remarkably regulate the peripheral and central sensitisation, which in turn mediate the development of chronic pain. Gut microbiota-derived mediators serve as critical modulators for the induction of peripheral sensitisation, directly or indirectly regulating the excitability of primary nociceptive neurones. In the central nervous system, gut microbiota-derived mediators may regulate neuroinflammation, which involves the activation of cells in the blood-brain , microglia, and infiltrating immune cells, to modulate induction and maintenance of central sensitisation. Thus, we propose that gut microbiota regulates pain in the peripheral and central nervous system, and targeting gut microbiota by diet and pharmabiotic intervention may represent a new therapeutic strategy for the management of chronic pain.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

However, number of tape strips varies between studies, and literature considering advancement into stratum corneum/epidermis in relation to number of tape strips is scarce. The aim of this pilot study was to assess the advancement through epidermis using tape stripping technique in healthy volunteers. A total of ten healthy volunteers were included. From all volunteers 0, , 15 and 35 consecutive tape strips (D-squame) were taken from four adjacent skin areas on the middle volar forearm, followed by Reflectance Confocal Microscopy (RCM) of the four areas to assess epidermal thickness. Squame Scan was used to determine amount of protein removed. Stratum corneum was completely removed in all volunteers after 35 tape strips. Advancement into epidermis was predominantly achieved by the first 15 tape strips, removing 25% of the total epidermis, whereas 35 tape strips removed 33% of epidermis. Protein removal per tape decreased with increasing depth. Information on advancement into the epidermis according to number of tape strips taken, is a significant step forward. The possibility to obtain samples from different layers of epidermis may lead to an improved understanding of skin  properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31346356>A Protective Role of the NRF2-Keap1 Pathway in Maintaining Intestinal  .</a></h2><p>Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) is a master regulator of cellular oxidative levels against environmental stresses.

This study investigated the role of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), a cytokine known to induce expression of the proprotein convertase Furin, in hypoxia-mediated  compromise. We show that exposure of brain endothelial cells (ECs) to hypoxia (1% O) rapidly stimulates their migration. Additional exogenous TGFβ (0.4 nM) exposure potentiated this effect and increased Furin expression in a TGFβ type I receptor activin-like kinase  (ALK5) - dependent manner (prevented by 10 μM SB431542). Furin inhibition prevented hypoxia-induced EC migration and blocked TGFβ-induced potentiation suggesting existence of a feedback loop. TGFβ and Furin were also critical for hypoxia-induced BBB dysfunction. TGFβ treatment aggravated hypoxia-induced BBB permeability but ALK5 or Furin blockade reversed injury-induced permeability changes. Thus during insult Furin compromises endothelial integrity by mediating the effects of TGFβ. Targeting the Furin or ALK5 pathway may offer novel therapeutic strategies for improving BBB stability and CNS  during disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, severe side effects, including abnormal mental functions, behavioral disturbances and intolerance are associated with this treatment. -HTP-induced elevation of plasma and brain serotonin levels may affect blood-brain  (BBB) breakdown, edema formation and regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) disturbances. Breakdown of BBB to serum proteins leads to vasogenic brain edema formation and cellular injuries. However, -HTP-neurotoxicity is still not well known. In this investigations -HTP induced elevation of endogenous plasma and brain serotonin levels and its effect on BBB breakdown, edema formation neuronal injuries was examined in a rat model. Furthermore, potential role of oxidative stress and nitric oxide (NO) was evaluated. In addition, several neurochemical agents such as p-CPA (-HT synthesis inhibitor) indomethacin (prostaglandin synthase inhibitor), diazepam (ant stress drug), cyproheptadine, ketanserin (-HT2 receptor antagonists) and vinblastine (inhibitor of microtubule ) were examined on -HT neurotoxicity. Our observations suggest that 4h after -HTP administrations, the endogenous serotonin levels increased by fourfold (150mg/kg) in the plasma and brain associated with profound hyperthermia (+3.86±0.24°C, oxidative stress and NO upregulation. Breakdown of the BBB to Evans blue albumin (EBA) in 8 brain regions and to Iodine in 14 brain regions was observed. The CBF exhibited marked reduction in all the brain regions examined. Brain edema and cellular injuries are present in the areas associated with BBB disruption. Drug treatments reduced the BBB breakdown, edema formation NO production and brain pathology. These observations are the first to point out that -HTP-neurotoxicity caused by BBB breakdown, edema formation and NO production is instrumental in causing adverse mental and behavioral abnormalities, not reported earlier.© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Laquinimod (LAQ), a poorly water-soluble compound, was proved to be effective for colitis remission at low dose of 0. mg/kg in patients with Crohn's disease. Due to its extremely low solubility in water, it was difficult to develop an injectable liquid dosage form. Herein, D-α-Tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate (TPGS) polymeric micelles were developed as a delivery vehicle of LAQ for the management of inflammatory bowel disease. Using the LAQ/TPGS ratio of 1:100, LAQ-loaded micelles were successfully prepared by thin-film dispersion method. The solubility of LAQ in water was significantly increased from 10. μg/mL in pure water to 500 μg/mL in TPGS micelles. LAQ-loaded micelles of TPGS exhibited the fine particle size of 34.6 nm and Zeta potential of -0.67 mV. Moreover, the good stability of LAQ-loaded micelles in -mimicking medium was confirmed by detecting their particle size, zeta potential and leakage of the loading drug. Therapeutic effect of LAQ-loaded micelles on DSS-induced mice was proved by detecting DAI score, colon length and loss of body weight. Moreover, the morphology and colonic mucosal  of the injured colon of DSS-induced mice was largely recovered after treatment with LAQ-loaded micelles. Meanwhile, the inflammation of colitis colon was also obviously alleviated by LAQ-loaded micelles. Conclusively, polymeric micelles of TPGS may be a promising delivery vehicle of LAQ for the management of inflammatory bowel disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ALCAM and its receptor CD6 are co-stimulatory molecules in the immunological synapse; their interaction is required for T cell activation. While atopic dermatitis (AD) is recognized as a T helper 2 (Th2)-mediated allergic disease, the role of ALCAM in its pathogenesis is unclear.ALCAM levels were measured in the serum of AD patients and AD-induced murine model by ovalbumin treatment. We next investigated transepidermal water loss, clinical score, Th2-immune responses, skin  gene expression and T-cell activation using wild-type (WT) and ALCAM deficiency mice. An oxazolone-induced AD-like model was also established and analyzed using WT- and ALCAM-deficient mice.We found that serum ALCAM levels were elevated in pediatric AD patients as well as WT AD mice, whereas Th2-type cytokine production and AD symptoms were suppressed in ALCAM-deficient mice. In addition, CD4⁺ effector T-cell counts in murine skin and skin-draining lymph nodes were lower in ALCAM-deficient mice than in their WT counterparts.

As a natural bioflavonoid, quercetin may exert protective effects on BBB dysfunction. This study aimed to investigate effects of quercetin in a rat model of global cerebral ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury and explore the potential mechanism. Male rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham group, I/R group, quercetin-treated group (25 μmol/kg twice daily for 3 consecutive days before I/R), and quercetin/DKK-1-treated group. Global cerebral I/R was induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion combined with hypotension for 20 min and reperfusion for 24 h. Neurological  was scored, and then rats were sacrificed. The brain was harvested for HE staining, NeuN staining, and detection of brain water content. The BBB structure and permeability were examined by transmission electron microscopy and Evans blue extravasation, respectively. The protein expression of MMP-9, ZO-1, Claudin-, β-catenin, and GSK-3β, and the mRNA expression of Axin and LEF1 were detected in either the absence or presence of Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor DKK-1. Results showed that quercetin reduced brain edema and BBB leakage, and improved BBB dysfunction. Quercetin could increase the expression of ZO-1, Claudin-, β-catenin, and LEF1, and decrease the expression of MMP-9, GSK-3β and Axin. And all these protective effects of quercetin could be reversed by DKK-1. Thus, quercetin can alleviate BBB dysfunction after global cerebral I/R in rats and the mechanism may be related to the activation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569528>Syncytiotrophoblast of Placentae from Women with Zika Virus Infection Has Altered Tight Junction Protein Expression and Increased Paracellular Permeability.</a></h2><p>The cytotrophoblast of human placenta transitions into an outer multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast (STB) layer that covers chorionic villi which are in contact with maternal blood in the intervillous space. During pregnancy, the Zika virus (ZIKV) poses a serious prenatal threat. STB cells are resistant to ZIKV infections, yet placental cells within the mesenchyme of chorionic villi are targets of ZIKV infection. We seek to determine whether ZIKV can open the paracellular pathway of STB cells. This route is regulated by tight junctions (TJs) which are present in the uppermost portion of the lateral membranes of STB cells. We analyzed the paracellular permeability and expression of E-cadherin, occludin, JAMs -B and -C, claudins -1, -3, -4, - and -7, and ZO-1, and ZO-2 in the STB of placentae from ZIKV-infected and non-infected women. In ZIKV-infected placentae, the pattern of expression of TJ proteins was preserved, but the amount of claudin-4 diminished. Placentae from ZIKV-infected women were permeable to ruthenium red, and had chorionic villi with a higher mean diameter and Hofbauer hyperplasia. Finally, ZIKV added to the basolateral surface of a trophoblast cell line reduced the transepithelial electrical resistance.

The glucocorticoid Dexamethasone is an important pharmaceutical for the treatment of colitis and other inflammatory bowel diseases. While suppressive effects of glucocorticoids on activated immune cells is significant, their effects upon epithelial cells are less well studied. Previous research shows that the effects of Dexamethasone treatment on polarized Caco-2 cell layer permeability is delayed for >10 treatment days (as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance).  intestinal epithelial cells turn over every 3- days; we therefore hypothesized that culture age may produce marked effects on gene expression, potentially acting as a confounding variable. To investigate this issue, we cultured polarized Caco-2 monolayers during a 30-day timecourse with ~15 days of continuous Dexamethasone exposure. We collected samples during the timecourse and tested differential expression using a 250-plex gene expression panel and Nanostring nCounter® system. Our custom panel was selectively enriched for KEGG annotations for tight-junction, actin cytoskeleton regulation, and colorectal cancer-associated genes, allowing for focused gene ontology-based pathway enrichment analyses. To test for confounding effects of time and Dexamethasone variables, we used the Nanostring nSolver differential expression data model which includes a mixturenegative binomial modelwith optimization. We identified a time-associated "EMT-like" signature with differential expression seen in important actomyosin cytoskeleton, tight junction, integrin, and cell cycle pathway genes.

However, an increasing number of studies have recently authenticated its biotoxicological effects. In this study, for evaluating the gut toxicity of F-53B in mammals, both female and male mice were orally exposed to 0, 1, 3, or 10 μg/L F-53B for 10 weeks. Our results showed that F-53B significantly accumulated in the colon, ileum and serum when exposed to 10 μg/L F-53B for 10 weeks. F-53B exposure not only increased the transcriptional levels of ion transport-related genes but could also interact with the CFTR protein directly. Interestingly, subchronic F-53B exposure also increased the transcription of mucus secretion-related genes, but the protein level of Muc2 decreased after F-53B exposure, indicating that there was a compensatory phenomenon after mucus  injury. Furthermore, F-53B exposure also induced colonic inflammation associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis in the colon. Taken together, our results indicated that the potential gut toxicity of F-53B and almost all of the changed parameters were significantly affected in both female and male mice, suggesting that F-53B could disturb the gut  without sex dependence in mice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The method was applied to compare three groups: tears (T) of non-wearers, tears (T) of regular wearers of etafilcon A CLs, and tears (T) of regular wearers of omafilcon A CLs. Zeta potential (ζ) as a  of pH was measured by a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern Instruments) on 40%-diluted samples, obtained by mixing 57 μL of tears of different subjects of the same group with 85 μL of HCl aqueous solution. IEP was deduced as the pH at which ζ is zero, i.e. the net electric charge on tear constituents being neutralized.Within an error of about 0.05, IEPs were found to be 2.90 (T), 2.80 (T), and 3.16 (T). On average, a lower H concentration is needed to neutralize the surface charge of the tear components of etafilcon A wearers, compared to both T and T.IEP measurements on tear samples of wearers of different types of CLs are proposed in order to enhance the knowledge on the modifications of the profile of charged species in tears. The T results, compared to those of the other groups, are compatible with an increase, due to the wear of etafilcon A CLs, of the relative concentration of high-IEP proteins.Copyright © 2019.

To achieve this objective, overlapping actions of complex cellular processes, such as migration, proliferation, and differentiation, are required. These events are longitudinally and tightly controlled by numerous factors including a wide range of distinct regulatory proteins. However, the sequence of events associated with colon mucosal repair after colitis and the evolution of the luminal content characteristics during this process have been little studied.To document the evolution of colon mucosal characteristics during mucosal healing using a mouse model with chemically-induced colitis.C57BL/6 male mice were given 3.% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water for  d. They were euthanized 2 (day 7),  (day 10), 8 (day 13), and 23 (day 28) d after DSS removal. The colonic luminal environment and epithelial repair processes during the inflammatory flare and colitis resolution were analyzed with reference to a non-DSS treated control group, euthanized at day 0. Epithelial repair events were assessed histo-morphologically in combination with functional permeability tests, expression of key inflammatory and repairing factors, and evaluation of colon mucosa-adherent microbiota composition by 16S rRNA sequencing.The maximal intensity of colitis was concomitant with maximal alterations of intestinal   and histological damage associated with goblet cell depletion in colon mucosa. It was recorded 2 d after termination of the DSS-treatment, followed by a progressive return to values similar to those of control mice. Although signs of colitis were severe (inflammatory cell infiltrate, crypt disarray, increased permeability) and associated with colonic luminal alterations (hyperosmolarity, dysbiosis, decrease in short-chain fatty acid content), epithelial healing processes were launched early during the inflammatory flare with increased gene expression of certain key epithelial repair modulators, including transforming growth factor-β, interleukin (Il)-15, Il-22, Il-33, and serum amyloid A. Whereas signs of inflammation progressively diminished, luminal colonic environment alterations and microscopic abnormalities of colon mucosa persisted long after colitis induction.This study shows that colon repair can be initiated in the context of inflamed mucosa associated with alterations of the luminal environment and highlights the longitudinal involvement of key modulators.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31421906>Improving CNS Delivery to Brain Metastases by Blood-Tumor  Disruption.</a></h2><p>Brain metastases encompass nearly 80% of all intracranial tumors. A late stage diagnosis confers a poor prognosis, with patients typically surviving less than 2 years. Poor survival can be equated to limited effective treatment modalities. One reason for the failure rates is the presence of the blood-brain  (BBB) and blood-tumor  (BTB) that limit the access of potentially effective chemotherapeutics to metastatic lesions. Strategies to overcome these barriers include new small molecule entities capable of crossing into the brain parenchyma, novel formulations of existing chemotherapies, and disruptive techniques. Here, we review BBB  and BTB pathophysiology. Additionally, we review the limitations of routinely practiced therapies and three current methods being explored for BBB/BTB disruption for improved delivery of chemotherapy to brain tumors.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Experiments were conducted in broiler chickens to evaluate supplementation of L-glutamine, glycine, and L-arginine in a reduced protein (RP) diet. Experiment 1 examined the growth performance of broilers fed  dietary treatments: 1) a standard diet; 2) an RP diet (193.9 g/kg CP in grower and 176.9 g/kg CP in finisher); 3) RP diet supplemented with 10 g/kg L-Gln; 4) RP diet supplemented with 10 g/kg Gly; ) RP diet supplemented with  g/kg L-Arg. Each experimental diet was replicated 6 times with 10 birds per replicate. In a subset of 96 birds, experiment 2 tested the 4 RP diets with and without dexamethasone (DEX) to induce leaky gut. Each diet was replicated 24 times. Fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d) was used to test intestinal permeability (IP). Gene expression of selected tight junction proteins in ileal and jejunal tissues was assayed by quantitative PCR. From day 7 to 35, the RP diet increased feed intake (FI) (P < 0.05) and body weight gain (BWG) compared with the standard diet while Gln reduced FI and BWG (P < 0.05) compared with RP. Gly had no effect on BWG or FCR. Supplementation of Arg improved FCR from day 21 to 35 and day 7 to 35. In experiment 2, Arg tended to lower FITC-d (P = 0.086). DEX increased passage of FITC-d into the serum (P < 0.001). The villi surface area was increased in birds fed higher Arg (P < 0.05). DEX and diet interacted (P < 0.01) for jejunal claudin-3 mRNA level where DEX upregulated claudin-3 for all diets except the Arg diet. In summary, with a moderate reduction of protein, satisfactory performance can be obtained. Although Gln and Gly had no demonstrable positive effect on IP and performance of broilers, increasing the dietary Arg by approximately 140% improved FCR and showed indications of improved intestinal   of birds fed an RP diet under a stress model.© The Author(s) 2019.

Processes that contribute to the resulting  loss include endocytic occludin removal from the tight junction and reduced occludin expression. Nevertheless, the relatively-normal basal phenotype of occludin knockout (KO) mice has been taken as evidence that occludin does not contribute to gastrointestinal  . We asked whether stress could unmask occludin functions within intestinal epithelia.Wildtype (WT), universal and intestinal epithelial-specific occludin KO, and villin-EGFP-occludin transgenic mice as well as WT and occludin knockdown (KD) Caco-2 cell monolayers were challenged with DSS, TNBS, staurosporine, -FU, or TNF. Occludin and caspase-3 expression were assessed in patient biopsies.Intestinal epithelial occludin loss limited severity of DSS- and TNBS-induced colitis due to epithelial resistance to apoptosis; activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways was blocked in occludin KO epithelia. Promoter analysis revealed that occludin enhances CASP3 transcription and, conversely, that occludin downregulation reduces caspase-3 expression. Analysis of biopsies from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients and normal controls demonstrated that disease-associated occludin downregulation was accompanied by and correlated with reduced caspase-3 expression. In vitro, cytokine-induced occludin downregulation resulted in reduced caspase-3 expression and resistance to intrinsic and extrinsic pathway apoptosis, demonstrating an overall protective effect of inflammation-induced occludin loss.The tight junction protein occludin regulates apoptosis by enhancing caspase-3 transcription. These data suggest that reduced epithelial caspase-3 expression downstream of occludin downregulation is a previously-unappreciated anti-apoptotic process that contributes to mucosal homeostasis in inflammatory conditions.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is an inflammatory cytokine that is over-expressed in the keratinocytes of patients with AD. IL-33 transgenic mice, which express IL-33 specifically in keratinocytes, spontaneously develop AD-like eczema, suggesting that IL-33 is sufficient for the development of AD. IL-33 stimulates various cells, including group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), to produce type 2 cytokines, such as IL- and IL-13, and IL-33-stimulated basophils activate ILC2s via IL-4. ILC2s are enriched in human AD skin lesions, and ILC2 isolated from AD lesions, are activated by IL-33, not by thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). IL-33 induces IL-31, thereby promoting pruritus and scratching behavior. Conversely, scratching the skin promotes IL-33 release from keratinocytes. IL-33 reduces the expression of filaggrin and claudin-1; it also reduces the skin  . However,  destruction causes percutaneous exposure to allergens or IL-33 release. Thus, IL-33 is a common point of entry into the itch-scratch cycle of AD.

Based on the current literature, there are some molecular differences related to blood brain  (BBB) homeostasis disruption, inflammation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated injury between the immature and mature brain after an ischemic event. In particular, astrocytes, the main glial cells in brain, play a different role in neonatal and adult brain after stroke, as time course of glial activation is strongly age dependent.

However, the role of CDCA in regulating intestinal   remains largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effects of CDCA on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-impaired intestinal epithelial   and explore the underlying mechanisms. In IPEC-J2 cells, CDCA reversed the LPS-induced increase in transepithelial electrical resistance and decrease in tight junction protein expression. In addition, we found that farnesoid X receptor (FXR) but not Takeda G-protein receptor  was responsible for the CDCA-improved epithelial   impaired by LPS. Furthermore, CDCA blocked LPS-induced activation of the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) pathway in a FXR-dependent manner and elicited similar effects to MLCK inhibition. In mice, CDCA supplementation restored LPS-induced elevation of intestinal permeability and MLCK expression and reduction of tight junction protein expression, thus alleviating LPS-induced intestinal  impairment.

Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF-α) therapy alters the gut microbiota in many diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. However, little is known about the effect of TNF-α blocker treatment on the gut microbiota in ankylosing spondylitis. Herein, the effect of a TNF-α blocker on the gut microbiota in proteoglycan-induced arthritis was investigated. Proteoglycan-induced mice were treated with an rhTNFR:Fc solution of etanercept ( µg/g) for 4 weeks. rhTNFR:Fc treatment attenuated the arthritis incidence and severity of arthritis in the proteoglycan-induced mice and decreased inflammation in the ankle joints and ameliorated ileal tissue destruction. Moreover, high gut permeability occurred, and zonula occludens-1 and occludin protein levels were reduced in proteoglycan-induced mice. These levels were significantly restored by the administration of rhTNFR:Fc. The serum TNF-α and IL-17 levels were also decreased. In addition, flora analysis via 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing revealed that rhTNFR:Fc treatment restored the gut microbiota composition to a composition similar to that in control mice. In conclusion, anti-TNF-α therapy attenuated proteoglycan-induced arthritis progression and modulated the gut microbiota and intestinal  .

The present study was performed to investigate whether protective effects of hAMSC-CM against focal cerebral ischemia/ reperfusion (I/R) injury is associated with modulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. A rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was created and the animals were divided into three groups including sham, MCAO and MCAO + hAMSC-CM. Drug was administrated immediately after cerebral reperfusion (i.v). The expressions of mTOR, p-mTOR and LC3 were measured using Western blotting and real time-PCR, respectively. Apoptosis and neuronal loss were determined using TUNEL and Nissl staining, respectively. Infarct volume and the blood-brain  (BBB) damage were evaluated using 2,3,-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and Evans Blue (EB) uptake, respectively. Compared with sham, significant infarct volume, apoptotic cell death, and neuronal loss were found in MCAO rats that reversed by hAMSC-CM (P < 0.05). Likewise, MCAO rats exhibited increased mRNA level of light-chain 3 (LC3) and the LC3II/LC3I ratio as well as decreased expression level of p-mTOR that reversed by hAMSC-CM (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the expression of total mTOR among the experimental groups. In summary, our results demonstrate that hAMSC-CM gives rise to neuroprotection following ischemic stroke by restoring mTOR activity and inhibiting autophagy.Copyright © 2019.

The kinase RIPK4 and the transcription factor IRF6 are mutated in severe developmental syndromes in humans, and mice lacking these genes display epidermal hyperproliferation and soft-tissue fusions that result in neonatal lethality. Our understanding of how these genes control epidermal differentiation is incomplete. Here we show that the role of RIPK4 in mouse development requires its kinase activity; that RIPK4 and IRF6 expressed in the epidermis regulate the same biological processes; and that the phosphorylation of IRF6 at Ser413 and Ser424 primes IRF6 for activation. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), histone chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) of skin in wild-type and IRF6-deficient mouse embryos, we define the transcriptional programs that are regulated by IRF6 during epidermal differentiation. IRF6 was enriched at bivalent promoters, and IRF6 deficiency caused defective expression of genes that are involved in the metabolism of lipids and the formation of tight junctions. Accordingly, the lipid composition of the stratum corneum of Irf6 skin was abnormal, culminating in a severe defect in the  of the epidermal .

Research so far has shown that starch digestibility kinetics depends on the molecular structure of starch but also on the properties of the complex matrix in which starch granules are embedded in most feedstuffs. However, the manner in which genotype differences in the same plant affect starch digestibility kinetics has not yet been addressed. The present study explored the extent to which the starch digestibility rate in commercial high-yielding maize hybrids depended on amylose / amylopectin content, starch granule size and shape, and zein in total starch (TS) content.Hybrids differed in all the traits examined, giving the following ranges: amylose content, 165-207 g kg DM; zein in TS content, 70-89 g kg DM; starch granule equivalent diameter, 11.-12.3 μm, and in vitro starch digestion rate, 1.22-1.44 h . The starch digestion rate correlated negatively with zein in TS content (r = -0.36) and positively with equivalent diameter (r = 0.45). The negative correlation between starch digestion rate and zein in TS suggests that some zein remained after grinding and pepsin incubation and acted as a  to amylolytic enzymes.When starch granules are embedded in a complex protein matrix, zein limits their accessibility to enzymes and affects the starch digestibility rate. Surprisingly, our results suggest that when enzymes reach starch granules, they digest a greater proportion of the starch when the granules are larger. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31441407>[Effect of unfractionated heparin on high mobility group box 1-mediated expression of vascular endothelial cadherin].</a></h2><p>To observe the damage of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC)  permeability and the protective effect of unfractionated heparin (UFH), and to explore the down-regulated protection effect mechanism of UFH on HMGB1-mediated vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) expression.The trypsin-digested HUVEC were subcultured in culture flasks. When the cells were grown to 80%, they were randomly divided into four groups: phosphate buffer (PBS) control group (200 μL PBS), recombinant human high mobility group box 1 (rhHMGB1) treatment group (100 μg/L rhHMGB1), UFH control group (10 kU/L UFH), and UFH pretreatment group (10 kU/L UFH+100 μg/L rhHMGB1). The cells in each group were challenged with different reagent for 24 hours, and the activity of endothelial cells was determined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) colorimetric assay. The permeability of endothelial cells was measured by Transwell method, and the expression and distribution of VE-cadherin was observed by immunofluorescence. The protein expressions of VE-cadherin and phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-p38MAPK) were determined by Western Blot.After treatment with 100 μg/L rhHMGB1 for 24 hours, the activity of endothelial cells was not significantly different from that of the PBS control group (A value: 0.230±0.004 vs. 0.255±0.006, P > 0.05), but the permeability was significantly increased (glucan FD40 fluorescence intensity: 11.05±0.12 vs. 6.34±0.39, P < 0.05). Compared with PBS control group, the fluorescence microscopy showed that the VE-cadherin membrane localization was reduced, the distribution was loose, and there were obvious fissures between cells in rhHMGB1 treatment group, and quantitative analysis showed the protein expression of VE-cadherin was decreased significantly (VE-cadherin/β-actin: 0.16±0.04 vs. 0.31±0.03, P < 0.05), and the expression of p-p38MAPK protein was significantly increased (p-p38MAPK/β-actin: 0.79±0.03 vs. 0.26±0.05, P < 0.05). UFH pretreatment could protect HMGB1-mediated endothelial cell injury, cell permeability was significantly reduced (glucan FD40 fluorescence intensity: 9.11±0.23 vs. 11.05±0.12), fluorescence expression of VE-cadherin was enhanced, membrane localization was significantly increased, quantitative analysis showed that VE-cadherin protein expression was significantly up-regulated (VE-cadherin/β-actin: 0.24±0.02 vs. 0.16±0.04), and p38MAPK phosphorylation level was significantly decreased (p-p38MAPK/β-actin: 0.54±0.05 vs. 0.79±0.03), the difference was statistically significant as compared with rhHMGB1 treatment group (all P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in all parameters between PBS control group and UFH control group.UFH can protect the endothelial cell  from the HMGB1 by regulating the expression and distribution of VE-cadherin.

Blood, urine, and fecal samples, for evaluation of potential biomarkers, will be collected at various time points from all participants (longitudinal analyses). Participants will receive appropriate educational and nutritional interventions; non-responders will undergo further evaluation to determine eligibility for further workup, including upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Histopathological changes in duodenal biopsies will be compared with duodenal biopsies obtained from USA controls who have celiac disease, Crohn's disease, or who were found to have normal histopathology.

PNNs, whose structure is still not known in detail, surround cell bodies and dendrites, which leaves free space for synapses to come into contact. A reduction in the expression of many neuronal ECM components adversely affects processes that are associated with synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. At the same time, increased ECM activity, e.g., as a result of astrogliosis following brain damage or in neuroinflammation, can also have harmful consequences. The therapeutic use of enzymes to attenuate elevated neuronal ECM expression after injury or in Alzheimer's disease has proven to be beneficial by promoting axon growth and increasing synaptic plasticity. Yet, severe impairment of ECM  can also lead to neurodegeneration. Thus, it appears that to ensure healthy neuronal  a delicate balance of ECM components must be maintained. In this paper we review the structure of PNNs and their components, such as hyaluronan, proteoglycans, core proteins, chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans, tenascins, and Hapln proteins. We also characterize the role of ECM in the functioning of the blood-brain , neuronal communication, as well as the participation of PNNs in synaptic plasticity and some clinical aspects of perineuronal net impairment.

First, amino acid residues of the binding sites of degrading enzymes for the target fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin (CIP), norfloxacin (NOR) and ofloxacin (OFL) were analysed by the molecular docking method. The hydrophobic amino acid residues within  Å of the target fluoroquinolone molecules were selected as the modification sites. The hydrophobic amino acid residues at the modified sites were replaced by the hydrophilic amino acid residues, and 150 amino acid sequence modification schemes of the degrading enzymes were designed. Subsequently, a reconstruction scheme of the degrading enzyme amino acid sequence reconstruction scheme was submitted to the SWISS-MODEL server and a selected homology modelling method was used to build a new structure of the degrading enzyme. At the same time, the binding affinities between the novel degrading enzymes and the target fluoroquinolones (represented by the docking scoring ) were evaluated by the molecular docking method. It was found that the novel enzymes can simultaneously improve the binding affinities for the three target fluoroquinolones, and the degradation ability of the six modification schemes was increased by more than 50% at the same time. Among the novel enzymes, the affinity effect of the novel anaerobic enzyme (6-1) with CIP, NOR and OFL was significantly increased, with increases of 129.24%, 165.06% and 169.59%, respectively, followed by the facultative enzyme and aerobic enzyme. In addition, the designed degrading enzymes had certain selectivity for the degradation of the target quinolone. Among the novel enzymes, the binding affinities of the novel anaerobic enzyme (6-3) and CIP, the novel aerobic enzyme (3-6) and NOR, and the novel facultative enzyme (13-6) and OFL were increased by 149.71%, 178.57% and 297.12% respectively. Calculations using the Gaussian09 software revealed that the degradation reaction  of the novel degrading enzyme (7-1) and CIP NOR and OFL decreased by 37.65 kcal·mol, 6.28 kcal·mol and 6.28 kcal·mol, respectively, which would result in efficient degradation of the target fluoroquinolone molecules. By analysing the binding affinity of the degrading enzymes before and after the modification with methanol, it was further speculated that the degradation effect of the modified aerobic degrading enzymes on organic matter was lower than that before the modification, and the increase or decrease in the degradation effect was less than 10%. The mechanism analysis found that the interaction between the modified amino acid residues of the degrading enzymes and the fluoroquinolone molecules increased. The average distance between the amino acid residues and the fluoroquinolone molecules represented a comprehensive affinity effect, and its value was positively correlated with the degradation effect of the novel degrading enzymes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31405131>Influence of Atopic Dermatitis on Cow's Milk Allergy in Children.</a></h2><p>: Cow's milk protein allergy (CMA) is the most common allergy in children. The natural history of CMA is generally favorable and the majority of children reach tolerance during childhood, even if studies show variable results. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a complex disease from an immunological point of view. It is characterized by an impaired skin   and is often the first clinical manifestation of the so-called "atopic march". The aim of our study is to evaluate, in a cohort of children with CMA, if the presence of AD in the first months of life can influence the atopic status of patients, the tolerance acquisition to cow's milk, the level of specific IgE (sIgE), and the sensitization towards food and/or inhalant allergens. : We enrolled 100 children with a diagnosis of CMA referred to our Pediatric Allergology Unit, aged 1-24 months at the time of the first visit. : 71 children had AD and 29 did not. The mean follow-up was .28 years. The CMA manifestations were mainly cutaneous, especially in children with AD (91.6% vs. 51.7%;  < 0.001). Patients with AD showed higher rates of polysensitization to foods and higher levels of both total IgE and sIgE for milk, casein, wheat, peanuts, and cat dander at different ages when compared to patients without AD. We analyzed the presence of IgE sensitization for the main foods and inhalants at various ages in the two groups of patients: a statistically significant difference emerged in the two groups of patients for milk, yolk and egg white, hazelnut, peanuts, soybean, grass pollen and cat dander. Meanwhile, we did not find significant differences in terms of tolerance acquisition toward cow's milk, which was nonetheless reached around  years of age in 61% of patients. The level of cow's milk sIgE at the age of  years was significantly higher in the group of patients who did not acquire tolerance (38.38 vs. .22 kU/L;  < 0.0001). : An early  deficiency appears to promote the development of allergic sensitization, but does not seem to influence the acquisition of tolerance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31381296>Influence of the Aliphatic Side Chain on the Near Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Polymerization of 2-Alkyl-2-oxazolines for Biomedical Applications.</a></h2><p>Plasma polymerization is gaining popularity as a technique for coating surfaces due to the low cost, ease of operation, and substrate-independent nature. Recently, the plasma polymerization (or deposition) of 2-oxazoline monomers was reported resulting in coatings that have potential applications in regenerative medicine. Despite the structural versatility of 2-oxazolines, only a few monomers have been subjected to plasma polymerization. Within this study, however, we explore the near atmospheric pressure plasma polymerization of a range of 2-oxazoline monomers, focusing on the influence of the aliphatic side-chain length (methyl to butyl) on the plasma polymerization process conditions as well as the properties of the obtained coatings. While side-chain length had only a minor influence on the chemical composition, clear effects on the plasma polymerization conditions were observed, thus gaining valuable insights in the plasma polymerization process as a  of monomer structure. Additionally, cytocompatibility and cell attachment on the coatings obtained by 2-oxazoline plasma polymerization was assessed. The coatings displayed strong cell interactive properties, whereby cytocompatibility increased with increasing aliphatic side-chain length of the monomer, reaching up to 93% cell viability after 1 day of cell culture compared to tissue culture plates. As this is in stark contrast to the antifouling behavior of the parent polymers, we compared the properties and composition of the plasma-polymerized coatings to the parent polymers revealing that a significantly different coating structure was obtained by plasma polymerization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31408825>Reepithelialization in focus: Non-invasive monitoring of epidermal wound healing in vitro.</a></h2><p>Up to today, in vivo studies are the gold standard for testing of new therapeutics for cutaneous wound healing. Alternative in vitro studies are mostly limited to two-dimensional cell cultures and thus only poorly reflect the complex physiological wound situation.

We assessed the skin  quantitatively and qualitatively by calculating the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), by fitting an equivalent circuit and by analyzing the single characteristic frequency. Upon wounding using a 2 mm biopsy punch, the impedance dropped significantly to 3.% of the initial value. Impedance spectroscopy thereby proved to be a sensitive tool to distinguish between wounds of different sizes.

We observed that intraperitoneally injected thorium (6.3 mg/kg body weight) crossed the blood-brain  and was localized in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and hypothalamus of the rats in the given order. Thorium administration significantly decreased the GSH level and increased MDA, NO, and Fe levels. Furthermore, thorium administration decreased NE and DA levels and induced fluctuations in -HT level. Thorium administration also increased serum TSH level, which in turn increased T4 and T3 levels. Together, these results indicate that thorium administration stimulates TSH secretion, which significantly increases T4 and T3 secretion from the thyroid gland. Moreover, these results indicate that thorium administration exerts hazardous effects on the neuroendocrine axis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415109>Food-grade titanium dioxide (E171) by solid or liquid matrix administration induces inflammation, germ cells sloughing in seminiferous tubules and blood-testis  disruption in mice.</a></h2><p>Food-grade titanium dioxide labeled as E171 has been approved for human consumption by the Food and Drug Administration (USA) and by the European Union for five decades. However, titanium dioxide has been classified as a possible carcinogen for humans by the International Agency of Research in Cancer raising concerns of its oral intake and the translocation to bloodstream, which could disturb barriers such as the blood-testis . There is evidence that titanium dioxide by intragastric/intraperitoneal/intravenous administration induced alterations on testosterone levels, testicular  and architecture, but studies of the E171 effects on the testicle structure and blood-testis  are limited. E171 is contained not only in foods in liquid matrix but also in solid ones, which can exert different biological effects. We aimed to compare the effects of E171 consumption in a solid matrix (0.1%, 0.% and 1% in pellets) and liquid suspension ( mg/kg body weight) on testis structure, inflammation infiltrate and blood-testis  disruption of male BALB/c mice. Results showed that none of the administration routes had influence on body weight but an increase in germ cell sloughing and the infiltrate of inflammatory cells in seminiferous tubules, together with disruption of the blood-testis  were similar in testis of both groups even if the dose received in mice in liquid matrix was 136 or 260 times lower than the dose reached by oral intake in solid E171 pellets in 0.% E171 and 1% E171, respectively. This study highlights the attention on matrix food containing E171 and possible adverse effects on testis when E171 is consumed in a liquid matrix.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31400921>Modeling of Drug Diffusion Based on Concentration Profiles in Healthy and Damaged Human Skin.</a></h2><p>Based on experimental drug concentration profiles in healthy as well as tape-stripped ex vivo human skin, we model the penetration of the antiinflammatory drug dexamethasone into the skin layers by the one-dimensional generalized diffusion equation. We estimate the position-dependent free-energy and diffusivity profiles by solving the conjugated minimization problem, in which the only inputs are concentration profiles of dexamethasone in skin at three consecutive penetration times. The resulting free-energy profiles for damaged and healthy skin show only minor differences. In contrast, the drug diffusivity in the first 10 μm of the upper skin layer of damaged skin is 200-fold increased compared to healthy skin, which reflects the corrupted   of tape-stripped skin. For the case of healthy skin, we examine the robustness of our method by analyzing the behavior of the extracted skin parameters when the number of input and output parameters are reduced. We also discuss techniques for the regularization of our parameter extraction method.Copyright © 2019 Biophysical Society. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Vanillin (Van), a natural phenolic compound with neuroprotective properties, exerts neuroprotection on a gerbil model of global ischemia by inhibiting oxidative damage. This study aimed to explore the potential neuroprotective roles of Van in neonatal rats suffering from hypoxic-ischemic (HI). An HI model of 7-day-old SD rats was induced by left carotid artery ligation followed by exposure to 8% oxygen (balanced with nitrogen) for 2. h at 37 °C. At 48 h after intraperitoneal injection with Van (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg) or saline, neurobehavioral , cerebral infract volume, brain water content, and histomorphological changes were performed to evaluate brain injury. Transmission electron microscopy and immunoglobulin G (IgG) staining were conducted to evaluate the integrity of the blood-brain  (BBB). The levels of oxidative stress and tight junction proteins, as well as the activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), were also determined in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Results showed that Van post-treatment significantly ameliorated early neurobehavioral deficits, decreased infarct volume and brain edema, as well as attenuated histopathologic injury and IgG extravasation. Furthermore, Van markedly increased the activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes and decreased malondialdehyde content. Meanwhile, the activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 induced by HI was partially blocked by Van. Finally, Van obviously increased the expression of ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin- compared with the HI group. Collectively, Van can provide neuroprotective effects against neonatal HIBD possibly by attenuating oxidative damage and preserving BBB integrity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Here, we characterized the functional role of circular RNA USP1 (circ-USP1) in the regulation of the blood-tumour  (BTB) permeability and the potential mechanisms. In the current study, the circ-USP1 expressing level was up-regulated in glioma cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (GECs) of the BTB model in vitro. Knockdown of circ-USP1 disrupted the  integrity, increased its permeability as well as reduced tight junction-related protein claudin-, occludin and ZO-1 expressions in GECs. Bioinformatic prediction and luciferase assay indicated that circ-USP1 bound to miR-194-5p and suppressed its activity. MiR-194-5p contributed to circ-USP1 knockdown-induced increase of BTB permeability via targeting and down-regulating transcription factor FLI1. Furthermore, FLI1 regulated the expressions of claudin-, occludin and ZO-1 in GECs through binding to their promoter regions. Single or combined treatment of circ-USP1 and miR-194-5p effectively promoted anti-tumour drug doxorubicin across BTB to induce apoptosis of glioma cells. Overall, this present study identified the crucial regulation of circ-USP1 on BTB permeability via miR-194-5p/FLI1 axis-mediated regulation of tight junction proteins, which might facilitate the development of therapeutics against human gliomas.© 2019 The Authors.

Throughout the sprints, velocity was measured using a laser velocity guard (LAVEG) to estimate maximal velocity (v) and power (P). The t was calculated as the time when power decreased by 3.% (t) and interpolated based on the sprint time (t and t). Reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), typical error (TE) and smallest worthwhile change (SWC).After initial familiarisation, t, t, v, P and V˙La attained excellent reliability (ICC≥0.90), whereas t attained moderate reliability (ICC=0.518). The reliability of V˙La was higher when t or t were used (ICC=0.960) compared to using t (ICC=0.928). At T1, V˙La was significantly higher when stop-watch measurements were used. There was no difference between t and the interpolated time intervals and the associated V˙La-estimates.In running, V˙La and sprint performance parameters can easily and high-reliably be measured using this sport-specific field test. Interpolating t results in similar and more reliable values of V˙La. To improve the reliability and accuracy of the stop-watch estimate, a familiarisation should be performed.Copyright © 2019 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Sixty patients treated and scheduled to undergo radical resection of colorectal cancer in The Second Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University from March 2017 to December 2017 were selected and randomly divided into the glucose solution group (n=30) and combined probiotics group (n=30). Patients in both groups took orally 12.% glucose solution before surgery, and those in the combined probiotics group received bifidus-triple viable preparation every day for 7 consecutive days. Changes in endotoxin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) concentration, white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), D-lactic acid and urinary lactulose/mannitol (L/M) were detected before surgery and at 1, 3 and 7 days after surgery. The general condition was observed and changes in intestinal florae were compared between the two groups. The body temperature was measured every 4 h with an electronic thermometer, and the duration of fever was recorded (from the first day after operation to the time with normal body temperature after operation, axillary temperature <37.4°C), and the average heart rate was recorded by the ECG monitor. In addition, the time of the first anal exsufflation (the time from the beginning of the operation to the first anal exsufflation) was recorded. In the combined probiotics group, the plasma endotoxin, IGF-I concentration, D-lactic acid and urinary L/M levels were significantly lower than those in the glucose solution group (P<0.05). Moreover, the duration of postoperative fever, average heart rate at 7 days after surgery as well as WBC and CRP clinical indexes were obviously shorter and lower in the combined probiotics group than those in the glucose solution group (P<0.05). Therefore, the combined application of probiotics after surgery can effectively improve the imbalance of intestinal flora. In conclusion, preoperative oral administration of glucose solution combined with postoperative probiotics can improve the intestinal   after colorectal cancer surgery, and benefit the recovery of early inflammatory response after surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31357203>Skin Metabolism: Relevance of Skin Enzymes for Rational Drug Design.</a></h2><p>Transdermal therapeutic systems (TTS) have numerous pharmacological benefits. Drug release, for example, is independent of whether a patient is in a fed or a fasted state, and lower doses can be given as gastrointestinal and hepatic first-pass metabolism is avoided. In addition, inter- and intrapatient variability is minimized as the release of the drug is mainly controlled by the system. This makes TTS interesting as alternative systems to the most common dosage form of oral tablets. The difficulty with the dermal administration route is transporting the drug through the skin, since the skin is an efficient  against foreign bodies. Various strategies have been reported in the literature of how drug penetration can be improved. Most of them, however, focus on overcoming the stratum corneum as the first (mechanical) skin . However, penetration is much more complex, and the skin's   does not only depend on the stratum corneum; what has been underestimated is the second (biological) skin  formed of enzymes. Compared to the stratum corneum, very little is known about these enzymes, e.g., which enzymes are present in the skin and where exactly they are localized. Hence, very few strategies can be found for how to bypass or even use the skin enzyme  for TTS development. This review article provides an overview of the skin enzymes considered to be relevant for the biotransformation of dermally applied drugs. Also, we discuss the use of dermal prodrugs and soft drugs and give the stereoselectivity of skin metabolism careful consideration. Finally, we provide suggestions on how to make use of the current knowledge about skin enzymes for rational TTS design.© 2019 S.

P-glycoprotein  at the BBB was reduced at 2 weeks. In the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, neurofilament, which is important for neuronal , was decreased in HFD mice at 2 weeks, but recovered at 10 weeks.Our results suggest that changes in the status of insulin resistance influence expression of BBB transporters, which in turn may alter the expression of cognitive -related proteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625112>An Open-Label, Intra-Individual Study to Evaluate a Regimen of Three Cosmetic Products Combined with Medical Treatment of Rosacea: Cutaneous Tolerability and Effect on Hydration.</a></h2><p>Although rosacea management includes general skincare, previous studies have not evaluated comprehensive skincare regimens as adjuvants to other treatments.The primary objective of this open-label, intra-individual study of subjects with rosacea was to evaluate the cutaneous tolerability of a regimen consisting of Cetaphil PRO Redness Control Day Moisturizing Cream (once daily in the morning), Cetaphil PRO Redness Control Night Repair Cream (once daily in the evening) and Cetaphil PRO Redness Control Facial Wash (foam once in the morning and once in the evening). Secondary objectives were to evaluate the effect on transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and cutaneous hydration and to determine the subjects' evaluation of efficacy, tolerability and future use. A dermatologist examined subjects and measured TEWL and cutaneous hydration on day (D) 0, D7 and D21, when subjects ranked symptoms. Subjects completed a questionnaire on D21.The per-protocol population consisted of 42 subjects receiving treatment for rosacea. Eleven subjects developed adverse events, none of which were considered to be related to the skincare products. Five subjects showed signs or symptoms that were potentially associated with the skincare products that might suggest poor cutaneous tolerability; these were generally mild. TEWL decreased significantly by a mean of 17% on D7 and a mean of 28% on D21 compared with baseline (both P < 0.001). Skin hydration increased significantly by a mean of % on D7 (P = 0.008) and a mean of 10% on D21 (P < 0.001) compared with baseline. Subjects reported that the regimen was pleasant (98%) and effective (95%) and that it offered various benefits; 90% of subjects reported that they would like to continue to use the regimen and would buy the products.The skincare regimen improved skin hydration and skin   in subjects receiving medical treatment for rosacea and was well tolerated.Galderma S.A.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31358450>Outcome of Desensitization Therapy in Immunologically High-Risk Kidney Transplantation: Single-Center Experience.</a></h2><p>Sensitization to HLA antigens creates an immunologic , linked to an increased risk of antibody-mediated rejection and poorer graft survival, that remains a persistent and often impenetrable deterrent to transplantation. Desensitization can improve transplantation rates in broadly sensitized kidney transplant recipients. We aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of immunologic high-risk kidney recipients who had desensitization treatment with the outcomes of those who did not.We retrospectively evaluated patients who underwent desensitization protocol due to immunologic risk between 2010 and 2018. Living-donor transplantation patients with panel reactive antibody positivity, retransplantation, donor specific antibody, and/or single antigen bead positivity were included in the study. We excluded deceased-donor transplantation recipients. Demographic data (age, sex, etiology of end-stage renal disease, blood transfusions, pregnancy, etc), immunologic status (HLA-mismatch [HLA-MM], panel reactive antibody, donor specific antibody, etc), induction and maintenance of immunosuppressive medications, and complications (all-cause hospitalizations, episodes of acute rejections, etc) were noted. We compared data and clinical outcomes of patients who had desensitization (Group 1) with data and clinical outcomes of patients who had not had desensitization (Group 2).There were 124 living-kidney donors (49 female, mean age 43.7 ± 12.2 years, mean body mass index [BMI] 25.8 ± .8 kg/m, mean follow-up time 20.9 ± 14.6 months). Thirty-four of these patients (25 female, mean age 43.7 ± 12. years, mean follow-up time 26.1 ± 17.7 months, mean BMI 27 ± 6. kg/m) had desensitization treatment (rituximab+plasmapheresis for 19 patients, rituximab for 11 patients, rituximab+plasmapheresis+intravenous immunoglobulin for 4 patients). Ninety patients (24 female, mean age 43.7 ± 12.2 years, mean follow-up time 18.9 ± 12.9 months, mean BMI 25.3 ± .4 kg/m) had not had desensitization. There was no statistical difference between groups for age, sex, hepatitis serology, history of blood transfusion, history of pregnancy, or history of dialysis (P < .05 for all parameters). While scores for HLA-MM and HLA-relative intensity scale (RIS) were 2.7 ± 1.6 and 7.86 ± 6.2, respectively, in Group 1, in Group 2 the same scores were 2.1 ± 1.1 and 3.6 ± 2., respectively (P: .053 and .03). Delayed graft , acute rejection episodes, and hospitalizations were similar between groups (P: .47, .29, and .34, respectively). Follow-up time and length of hospitalization were longer in Group 1 (P: .013 and .001, respectively). Total doses of ATG were higher in Group 1 patients (P: .007).Despite the higher HLA-MM and RIS scores, clinical outcomes in desensitized patients were found to be similar to those in nondesensitized patients for acute rejection episodes and hospitalizations. Desensitization with rituximab in patients with high HLA-RIS scores can prevent acute rejection and hospitalization.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Microbial gut dysbiosis is associated with both AN and SIBO, and therefore gut microbiome changes by serial fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a possible therapeutic modality. This study assessed the effects of FMT on gut  , microbiota composition, and the levels of bacterial metabolic products. The patient treatment with FMT led to the improvement of gut  , which was altered prior to FMT. Very low bacterial alpha diversity, a lack of beneficial bacteria, together with a great abundance of fungal species were observed in the patient stool sample before FMT. After FMT, both bacterial species richness and gut microbiome evenness increased in the patient, while the fungal alpha diversity decreased. The total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) levels (molecules presenting an important source of energy for epithelial gut cells) gradually increased after FMT. Contrarily, one of the most abundant intestinal neurotransmitters, serotonin, tended to decrease throughout the observation period. Overall, gut microbial dysbiosis improvement after FMT was considered. However, there were no signs of patient clinical improvement.

The specific plasma proteins and the impact of storage conditions are uncertain. Utilizing a microfluidic device system, we studied the effect of various types of plasma on the endothelial   following T/HS.Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured in microfluidic plates. The microfluidic plates were subjected to control or shock conditions (hypoxia/reoxygenation + epinephrine, 10 μM). Fresh plasma, 1 day thawed plasma, -day thawed plasma and lyophilized plasma were then added. Supplementation of sphingosine-1 phosphate (S-1P) was done in a subset of experiments. Effect on the endothelial glycocalyx was indexed by shedding of syndecan-1 and hyaluronic acid. Endothelial injury/activation was indexed by soluble thrombomodulin, tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Vascular permeability determined by the ratio of angiopoietin-2 to angiopoietin-1. Concentration of S-1P and adiponectin in the different plasma groups was measured.Human umbilical vein endothelial cells exposed to shock conditions increased shedding of syndecan-1 and hyaluronic acid. Administration of the various types of plasma decreased shedding, except for -day thawed plasma. Shocked HUVEC cells demonstrated a profibrinolytic phenotype, this normalized with all plasma types except for -day thawed plasma. The concentration of S-1P was significantly less in the -day thawed plasma compared with the other plasma types. Addition of S-1P to -day thawed plasma returned the benefits lost with storage.A biomimetic model of the microcirculation following T/HS demonstrated endothelial glycocalyx and endothelial cellular injury/activation as well as a profibrinolytic phenotype. These effects were abrogated by all plasma products except the -day thawed plasma. Plasma thawed longer than  days had diminished S1-P concentrations.

This catalytic cycle proceeds via cleavage of a Co-C bond which is formally heterolytic. This cleavage results in a structural change in the MeCbl cofactor bound to an enzyme. Unlike the native catalysis, upon photoexcitation, the Co-C bond in MeCbl-bound MetH generates the Co(ii)/CH3 radical pairs (RPs). Protein residues of the cap domain, particularly phenylalanine708 (F708) and leucine 715 (L715), which surrounds the upper face of the MeCbl cofactor, inhibit the photolysis of MeCbl by caging the CH3 radical and inducing the geminate recombination of the Co(ii)/CH3 RP. A molecular-level understanding of these effects requires a detailed investigation of the low-lying electronic states. Toward this, we have mutated the F708 residue with alanine (A708) and constructed the potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the low-lying S1 electronic state using a combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approach. The S1 PESs for the wild-type (WT) and mutant enzymes are the result of crossing of two electronic states, namely metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) and ligand field (LF) states, indicated by a seam. It is shown that the topologies of the S1 PESs are significantly modulated by introducing a mutation at the F708 position. Specifically, for the WT enzyme, the energy  of photoreaction and the energy difference between MLCT and LF minima are markedly higher than those of its mutant counterpart. Moreover, mutation influences the photoactivation of the Co-C bond in enzyme-bound MeCbl by decreasing the rate of geminate recombination and altering the rate of radical pair formation. This theoretical insight was also compared with transient absorption spectroscopic (TAS) studies which are in good agreement with the present findings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31457074>A common neural signature of brain injury in concussion and subconcussion.</a></h2><p>The midbrain is biomechanically susceptible to force loading from repetitive subconcussive head impacts (RSHI), is a site of tauopathy in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and regulates functions (e.g., eye movements) often disrupted in concussion. In a prospective longitudinal design, we demonstrate there are reductions in midbrain white matter integrity due to a single season of collegiate football, and that the amount of reduction in midbrain white matter integrity is related to the amount of rotational acceleration to which players' brains are exposed. We then replicate the observation of reduced midbrain white matter integrity in a retrospective cohort of individuals with frank concussion, and further show that variance in white matter integrity is correlated with levels of serum-based tau, a marker of blood-brain  disruption.

Complex and continuous tight junctions (TJs) between brain endothelial cells block uncontrolled paracellular diffusion of molecules across the BBB, with claudin- being its dominant TJs protein. However, claudin- deficient mice still display ultrastructurally normal TJs, suggesting the contribution of other claudins or tight-junction associated proteins in establishing BBB junctional complexes. Expression of claudin-12 at the BBB has been reported, however the exact  and subcellular localization of this atypical claudin remains unknown.We created claudin-12-lacZ-knock-in C57BL/6J mice to explore expression of claudin-12 and its role in establishing BBB TJs  during health and neuroinflammation. We furthermore performed a broad standardized phenotypic check-up of the mouse mutant.Making use of the lacZ reporter allele, we found claudin-12 to be broadly expressed in numerous organs. In the CNS, expression of claudin-12 was detected in many cell types with very low expression in brain endothelium. Claudin-12 C57BL/6J mice lacking claudin-12 expression displayed an intact BBB and did not show any signs of BBB dysfunction or aggravated neuroinflammation in an animal model for multiple sclerosis. Determining the precise localization of claudin-12 at the BBB was prohibited by the fact that available anti-claudin-12 antibodies showed comparable detection and staining patterns in tissues from wild-type and claudin-12 C57BL/6J mice.Our present study thus shows that claudin-12 is not essential in establishing or maintaining BBB TJs integrity. Claudin-12 is rather expressed in cells that typically lack TJs suggesting that claudin-12 plays a role other than forming classical TJs. At the same time, in depth phenotypic screening of clinically relevant organ functions of claudin-12 C57BL/6J mice suggested the involvement of claudin-12 in some neurological but, more prominently, in cardiovascular functions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31406213>Neurotoxic potential of reactive astrocytes in canine distemper demyelinating leukoencephalitis.</a></h2><p>Canine distemper virus (CDV) causes a fatal demyelinating leukoencephalitis in young dogs resembling human multiple sclerosis. Astrocytes are the main cellular target of CDV and undergo reactive changes already in pre-demyelinating brain lesions. Based on their broad range of beneficial and detrimental effects in the injured brain reactive astrogliosis is in need of intensive investigation. The aim of the study was to characterize astrocyte plasticity during the course of CDV-induced demyelinating leukoencephalitis by the aid of immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and gene expression analysis. Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of reactive glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) astrocytes with increased survivin and reduced aquaporin 4, and glutamine synthetase protein levels, indicating disturbed blood brain  , glutamate homeostasis and astrocyte maladaptation, respectively. Gene expression analysis revealed 81 differentially expressed astrocyte-related genes with a dominance of genes associated with neurotoxic A1-polarized astrocytes. Accordingly, acyl-coA synthetase long-chain family member /GFAP, and serglycin/GFAP cells, characteristic of A1-astrocytes, were found in demyelinating lesions by immunofluorescence. In addition, gene expression revealed a dysregulation of astrocytic  including disturbed glutamate homeostasis and altered immune .

In neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE), autoimmune responses against neural self-antigens find expression in neurological and cognitive alterations. SLE autoantibodies often target nucleic acids, including RNAs and specifically RNA domains with higher-order structural content. We report that autoantibodies directed against neuronal regulatory brain cytoplasmic (BC) RNAs were generated in a subset of SLE patients. By contrast, anti-BC RNA autoantibodies (anti-BC abs) were not detected in sera from patients with autoimmune diseases other than SLE (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis) or in sera from healthy subjects with no evidence of disease. SLE anti-BC abs belong to the IgG class of immunoglobulins and target both primate BC200 RNA and rodent BC1 RNA. They are specifically directed at architectural motifs in BC RNA ' stem-loop domains that serve as dendritic targeting elements (DTEs). SLE anti-BC abs effectively compete with RNA transport factor heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2 (hnRNP A2) for DTE access and significantly diminish BC RNA delivery to synapto-dendritic sites of .  experiments with male BALB/c mice indicate that, upon lipopolysaccharide-induced opening of the blood-brain , SLE anti-BC abs are taken up by CNS neurons where they significantly impede localization of endogenous BC1 RNA to synapto-dendritic domains. Lack of BC1 RNA causes phenotypic abnormalities including epileptogenic responses and cognitive dysfunction. The combined data indicate a role for anti-BC RNA autoimmunity in SLE and its neuropsychiatric manifestations. Although clinical manifestations of neuropsychiatric lupus are well recognized, the underlying molecular-cellular alterations have been difficult to determine. We report that sera of a subset of lupus patients contain autoantibodies directed at regulatory brain cytoplasmic (BC) RNAs. These antibodies, which we call anti-BC abs, target the BC RNA ' domain noncanonical motif structures that specify dendritic delivery. Lupus anti-BC abs effectively compete with RNA transport factor heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2 (hnRNP A2) for access to BC RNAs.

Intracellular [Ca] signaling is essential for vasoactive agonist-induced stimulation of endothelial cells (ECs), typically including Ca release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although it is known that interactions of Ca and cAMP as ubiquitous messengers are involved in this process, the individual contribution of cAMP-generating adenylyl cyclases (ACs), including the only soluble AC (sAC; ADCY10), remains less clear. Using life-cell microscopy and plate reader-based [Ca] measurements, we found that human immortalized ECs, primary aortic and cardiac microvascular ECs, and primary vascular smooth muscle cells treated with sAC-specific inhibitor KH7 or anti-sAC-small interfering RNA did not show endogenous or exogenous ATP-induced [Ca] elevation. Of note, a transmembrane AC (tmAC) inhibitor did not prevent ATP-induced [Ca] elevation in ECs. Moreover, l-phenylephrine-dependent constriction of  mouse aortic ring segments was also reduced by KH7. Analysis of the inositol-1,4,-trisphosphate (IP) pathway revealed reduced IP receptor phosphorylation after KH7 application, which also prevented [Ca] elevation induced by IP receptor agonist adenophostin A. Our results suggest that sAC rather than tmAC controls the agonist-induced ER-dependent Ca response in ECs and may represent a treatment target in arterial hypertension and heart failure.-Mewes, M., Lenders, M., Stappers, F., Scharnetzki, D., Nedele, J., Fels, J., Wedlich-Söldner, R., Brand, S.-M., Schmitz, B., Brand, E.

We have executed new, comprehensive research on this vexing molecule via focal point analyses (FPA) to approach the ab initio limit of optimized geometric structures, relative energies, complete quartic force fields, and the entire reaction path for cis-trans isomerization. High-order coupled cluster theory was applied through the CCSDT(Q) and even CCSDTQ(P) levels, and CBS extrapolations were performed using cc-pVXZ (X = 2-6) basis sets. The cis isomer proves to be higher than trans by 0.52 kcal mol, but this energetic ordering is achieved only after the CCSDT(Q) milestone is reached; the  for cis → trans isomerization is a minute 0.27 kcal mol. The FPA central r(O-O) bond length of trans-HO is astonishingly long (1.670 Å), consistent with the semiexperimental r distance we extracted from microwave rotational constants of 10 isotopologues using FPA vibration-rotation interaction constants (α). The D(HO-O) dissociation energy converges to a mere 2.80 ± 0.25 kcal mol. Contrary to expectation for such a weakly bound system, vibrational perturbation theory performs remarkably well with the FPA anharmonic force fields, even for the torsional fundamental near 130 cm. Exact numerical procedures are applied to the potential energy  for the torsional reaction path to obtain energy levels, tunneling rates, and radiative lifetimes. The cis → trans isomerization occurs via tunneling with an inherent half-life of 1.4 × 10 s and 8.6 × 10 s for HO and DO, respectively, thus resolving the mystery of why the cis species has not been observed in previous experiments executed in dissipative environments that allow collisional cooling of the trans-HO product. In contrast, the pure ground eigenstate of the cis species in a vacuum is predicted to have a spontaneous radiative lifetime of about 1 h and  days for HO and DO, respectively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415870>The role of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors on retinal pigment epithelial cells   and angiogenic effects.</a></h2><p>Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a lysophospholipid mediator, promoting angiogenesis and inflammation via interactions with its receptors (S1P1-), but the receptors and signaling pathways responsible for the progression of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) remain unknown. We investigated the roles of S1P/S1P receptors in RPE cells. ARPE-19 cells were treated with S1P dissolved in carrier proteins of albumin or apolipoprotein M (ApoM). The mRNA expression levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8), C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The protein level of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α was assessed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HIF transcriptional activity was evaluated with a dual-reporter luciferase assay. Cellular  integrity was evaluated using transepithelial electrical resistance and the FITC-dextran permeability assay. The suppressive effect of an S1P antagonist on CNV progression was investigated with a laser-induced CNV model in mice. The increase in expression of IL-8, CCL2, and VEGF due to albumin-bound S1P was significantly mitigated by an S1P2 antagonist. The expression of HIF-1α significantly decreased with inhibition of S1P2 and S1P3. In addition, albumin-bound S1P disrupted the  integrity of retinal pigment epithelial cells via S1P2, whereas integrity was strengthened by ApoM-bound S1P. CNV lesions were significantly reduced in the mouse model with intravitreal injection of S1P2 antagonist. This study demonstrated that S1P significantly promotes angiogenesis, inflammation, and  integrity, which was attenuated by inhibition of S1P2 or S1P3, suggesting that regulation of S1P2 and S1P3 is a novel therapeutic target for CNV.Copyright © 2019.

Increasing evidence indicates that long-term use of irritant laxatives causes serious side effects. Meanwhile, more than 50% of patients are dissatisfied with sense of use of non-prescriptional laxatives. -glucans are natural polysaccharides widely found in yeast, fungus, and plants, which have been reported to exhibit various pharmacological effects. The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of -glucans extracted from the bread yeast cell wall on loperamide-induced constipation mice. Forty mice were fed with loperamide (10 mg/kg) to make the constipation model and a diet supplemented with 2., , and 10 mg/kg -glucan. We assessed the defecation frequency, intestinal transit  of mice, as well as used high-throughput sequencing to analyze the intestinal microbiota composition and functional biological profiles data. Meanwhile, we detected expression of neurotransmitters including acetylcholinesterase, substance P, and serotonin (-HT) and expression of tight junction protein (TJP) including zonula occludens-1 and mucin-2 in distal colon to characterize the possible molecular mechanisms. -glucans significantly enhanced intestinal motility and provided a possibility to regulate the expression of neurotransmitters and TJP in mice. The intestinal microecological portion of the treatment group partially recovered and was closer to the normal group. This study showed that -glucans can influence the intestinal microbiota and restore microecological balance to regulate the express of neurotransmitters and TJP to recover intestinal epithelial mechanical . We suggested that -glucans could be used as an active nutritional supplement to protect the damaged intestinal  and help patients who have constipation complications and dysbiosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605562>Long-Term Outcomes in Patients with Obesity and Renal Disease after Sleeve Gastrectomy.</a></h2><p>Morbid obesity is a  to kidney transplantation (KT) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is an increasingly considered intervention, but the safety and long-term outcomes are uncertain. We reviewed prospectively collected data on patients with ESRD and chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing SG from 2011 to 2018. 198 patients with ESRD and 45 patients with CKD (stages 1-4) met NIH guidelines for bariatric surgery and underwent SG. 72% and 48% achieved a BMI ≤40 and ≤35, respectively. The mean percentages of total weight loss and excess weight loss were 18.9±10.8% and 38.2±20.3%, respectively. SG reduced hypertension (HTN) (85.8% vs. 52.1%), decreased anti-hypertensive medications (1.6 vs. 1.0) (p<0.01 each), and reduced diabetes (59.6% vs. 32.%, p<0.01). 45 of the 71 patients with ESRD that achieved a BMI ≤40 were waitlisted and received KT, while ten remain on the waitlist. Mortality rate after SG was 1.8 per 100 patient-years, compared to 7.3 for non-SG. Patients with stage 3a or 3b CKD exhibited improved GFR (43. vs. 58.4 ml/min, p=0.01). In conclusion, SG safely improves transplant candidacy while providing significant, sustainable effects on weight loss, reducing medical comorbidities and possibly improving renal  in Stage 3 patients.© 2019 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415078>COMP-Ang1 Stabilizes Hyperglycemic Disruption of Blood-Retinal  Phenotype in Human Retinal Microvascular Endothelial Cells.</a></h2><p>Current treatments for diabetic retinopathy (DR) have considerable limitations, underpinning the need for new therapeutic options. In this article, the ability of an engineered angiopoietin-1 variant (COMP-Ang1) to ameliorate the injurious effects of hyperglycemia on  integrity in a human retinal microvascular endothelial cell (HRMvEC) model is comprehensively investigated.Confluent HRMvECs were treated (0-72 hours) with d-glucose ( or 30 mM) in the absence and presence of COMP-Ang1 (10-200 ng/mL). l-glucose (30 mM) was used as osmotic control. Posttreatment, intact cell monolayers were monitored for permeability to FITC-dextran 40 kDa. Cells were also harvested for analysis of interendothelial junction targets by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. The impact of receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 gene silencing on COMP-Ang1 efficacy was also evaluated.Treatment with 30 mM d-glucose (but not l-glucose) demonstrated a time-dependent elevation in the mean rate of FITC-dextran diffusion across intact HRMvEC monolayers, in parallel with significant reductions in mRNA/protein levels of occludin, claudin-, ZO-1, and VE-Cadherin. These effects were all attenuated by COMP-Ang1 in a concentration-dependent fashion, with 200 ng/mL recovering   by ∼88%, and recovering reduced interendothelial junction protein levels by more than 50%. Finally, Tie2 knockdown by small interfering RNA silencing blocked the ability of COMP-Ang1 to mitigate against hyperglycemia-induced permeabilization of HRMvECs and depletion of junctional expression levels.In summary, this article presents a reproducible in vitro cell study that quantifies the concentration-dependent efficacy of COMP-Ang1 to mitigate the injurious effects of hyperglycemic challenge on HRMvEC  properties via Tie2-mediated signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313888>Development of a new eczema-like reconstructed skin equivalent for testing child atopic dermatitis-relieving cosmetics.</a></h2><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease, and it has serious effects on children's and families' quality of life.

To investigate whether central oligodendrocytosis and gliosis triggered an adaptive immune response, the impact of combining a standard (0.2%) or low (0.1%) dose of ingested CPZ with disruption of the blood brain  (BBB), using pertussis toxin (PT), was assessed in mice. 0.2% CPZ(±PT) for  weeks produced oligodendrocytosis, demyelination and gliosis  marked splenic atrophy (37%) and reduced levels of CD4 (44%) and CD8 (61%). Conversely, 0.1% CPZ(±PT) produced a similar oligodendrocytosis, demyelination and gliosis but a smaller reduction in splenic CD4 (11%) and CD8 (14%) levels and  splenic atrophy. Long-term feeding of 0.1% CPZ(±PT) for 12 weeks produced similar reductions in CD4 (27%) and CD8 (43%), as well as splenic atrophy (33%), as seen with 0.2% CPZ(±PT) for  weeks. Collectively, these results suggest that 0.1% CPZ for  weeks may be a more promising model to study the 'inside-out' theory of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). However, neither CD4 nor CD8 were detected in the brain in CPZ±PT groups, indicating that CPZ-mediated suppression of peripheral immune organs is a major impediment to studying the 'inside-out' role of the adaptive immune system in this model over long time periods. Notably, CPZ(±PT)-feeding induced changes in the brain proteome related to the suppression of immune , cellular metabolism, synaptic  and cellular structure/organization, indicating that demyelinating conditions, such as MS, can be initiated in the absence of adaptive immune system involvement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571932>Once-daily fluticasone furoate/vilanterol combination versus twice-daily budesonide/formoterol combination in the treatment of controlled stable asthma: a randomized crossover trial.</a></h2><p>Fluticasone furoate (FF)/vilanterol (VI) dry powder inhaler (DPI) is the only once-daily maintenance inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/long-acting β2 adrenergic agonist (LABA) combination for asthma. We aimed to compare the clinical effects of once-daily FF/VI and twice-daily budesonide (BUD)/formoterol (FM) DPI in patients with controlled stable asthma.We performed a randomized crossover trial in which stable asthmatic patients controlled on ICS/LABA received 8 weeks of FF/VI (100/25 μg 1 puff once-daily) or BUD/FM (160/4. μg 2 puffs twice-daily) DPI treatment. After a 4-8-week washout period, patients received another crossover treatment for 8 weeks. We assessed pulmonary , the -item version asthma control questionnaire (ACQ5), the asthma control test (ACT), and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment (week 8). As the primary outcome was change in force expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV) between baseline and week 8, we evaluated the incidence of asthma exacerbation and adherence  questionnaire (Ask-12) at week 8.Twenty-three patients were initially enrolled in this study; however, one patient had to be excluded. The FF/VI DPI treatment group showed a similar magnitude of change in FEV between baseline and week 8 as the BUD/FM DPI treatment group. In addition, there were no significant differences in pulmonary  tests, ACQ5 scores, ACT scores, and FeNO between baseline and week 8 in both groups. Although the incidence of exacerbation did not differ between groups, the Ask-12 score in the FF/VI DPI group was significantly lower than that in the BUD/FM DPI group.The present study indicates that once-daily FF/VI DPI is not inferior to twice-daily BUD/FM DPI in clinical effect and more likely to improve inconvenience and forgetfulness in inhalation adherence barriers for stable asthma control therapy.

Exclusion criteria included type I diabetes and previous pancreas transplantation. NODAT was defined as a new insulin requirement after KT. Delayed graft  was defined as need for dialysis within the first week after KT. Mean posttransplant follow-up period was 22 months.Forty-one patients underwent KT after LSG after median time of 16 months. Median age of postLSG patients undergoing KT was 56.0 years at time of KT. Average body mass index decreased by 9 from the time of LSG to KT, and no patients regained weight at 1-year follow-up. After LSG, the number of patients with hypertension (85.4% versus 48.%) and the number of antihypertensive medications used decreased significantly (1.6 versus .6) at time of KT (P < .001 each). At 1-year follow-up, the improvement in hypertension persisted (51.2% versus 48.%, P = nonsignificant). The average insulin regimen decreased from 33.0 ± 51.6 to 11.7 ± 21. units at KT (P < .001). This improvement also persisted at 1-year follow-up (11.9 versus 11.7 units, P = nonsignificant). Zero patients suffered NODAT over the follow-up period (versus institutional rate of NODAT at 15.8%).

Vascularization is one of the major challenges for recapitulating processes in the developing human brain. Here, we examined the formation of blood vessel-like structures in cerebral organoids induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in vitro. The results indicated that VEGF enhanced differentiation of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) without reducing neuronal markers in the embryonic bodies (EBs), which then successfully developed into cerebral organoids with open-circle vascular structures expressing an EC marker, CD31, and a tight junction marker, claudin-, characteristic of the blood-brain  (BBB). Further treatment with VEGF and Wnt7a promoted the formation of the outer lining consisting of pericyte-like cells, which surrounded the vascular tubes. RNA sequencing revealed that VEGF upregulated genes associated with tube formation, vasculogenesis, and the BBB; it also changed the expression of genes involved in brain embryogenesis, suggesting a role of VEGF in neuronal development.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of succinate on intestinal epithelial   and inflammation in pigs. Twenty-four growing pigs were distributed into three groups ( = 8) and received either a basal diet (control group) or the same diet supplemented with 0.1% succinate or 1% succinate. The diet supplemented with 1% succinate led to alterations in the intestinal morphology.

Recently, histone lysine β-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) was identified as a new form of histone acylation that connects starvation-responsive metabolism to epigenetic regulation. Sirtuins are a family of NAD-dependent deacetylases. Through systematic profiling studies, we show that human SIRT3 displays class-selective histone de-β-hydroxybutyrylase activities with preference for H3 K4, K9, K18, K23, K27, and H4K16, but not for H4 K5, K8, K12, which distinguishes it from the Zn-dependent HDACs. Structural studies revealed a hydrogen bond-lined hydrophobic pocket favored for the S-form Kbhb recognition and catalysis. β-backbone but not side chain-mediated interactions around Kbhb dominate sequence motif recognition, explaining the broad site-specificity of SIRT3. The observed class-selectivity of SIRT3 is due to an entropically unfavorable  associated with the glycine-flanking motif that the histone Kbhb resides in. Collectively, we reveal the molecular basis for class-selective histone de-β-hydroxybutyrylation by SIRT3, shedding lights on the  of sirtuins in Kbhb biology through hierarchical deacylation.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31394104>Shear stress modulates inner blood retinal  phenotype.</a></h2><p>The vascular endothelium responds to the shear stress generated by blood flow and changes  to maintain tissue homeostasis and adapt to injury in pathological conditions. Shear stress in the retinal circulation is altered in patients with retinal vascular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy. Therefore, we aimed to study the effect of laminar shear stress on  properties and on the release of proinflammatory cytokines in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMEC). HRMEC were cultured in Ibidi flow chambers and exposed to laminar shear stress (0-50 dyn/cm) for 24-48 h. Tight junction distribution (ZO-1 and claudin-) and cytokine production were determined by immunofluorescence and ELISA, respectively. The chemotactic effect of conditioned media exposed to shear stress was determined by measuring lymphocyte transmigration in Transwells. We found that cells exposed to moderately low shear stress (1. and  dyn/cm) showed enhanced distribution of membrane ZO-1 and claudin- and decreased production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-8, CCL2, and IL-6 compared to static conditions and high shear stress values. Moreover, conditioned media from cells exposed to low shear stress, had the lowest chemotactic effect to recruit lymphocytes compared to conditioned media from cells exposed to static and high shear stress conditions.

Since aquaporins (AQPs) have essential roles in the integrity of   during fluid transport, especially AQP5 in the maintaining of the epithelium permeability, the current study is aimed to evaluate the potential role of LXA4 in regulating alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) during fluid transport and the corresponding change of AQP5 in the lung.ALI was induced by the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneal injection, and LXA4 treatment was given 8 hours after LPS administration. We investigated changes in the capacity of AFC, pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and the severity of ALI. Then AQP5 expression in lung tissue and potential regulatory pathways in LPS-induced ALI was explored.LXA4 treatment was found to inhibit AFC capacity, inflammatory cytokine release, partially, alleviate ALI severity, and restored AQP5 expression partially. Additionally, we found that LXA4 played a protective role by the inhibition of the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK.In summary, our results suggest that LXA4 plays a protective role in lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI by restoring AFC capacity and upregulating AQP5 expression and inhibiting the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK.

The two most active analogues 1-benzyl-N-(,6-dimethoxy-8H-indeno[1,2-d]thiazol-2-yl)piperidine-4-carboxamide (28) and 1-benzyl-N-(1-methyl-3-oxo-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-4-yl) piperidine-4-carboxamide (20) afforded in vitro IC values of 0.41 ± 1.25 and .94 ± 1.08 μM, respectively.

We extracted 8 years of medication orders and diagnostic claims. We licensed a database of medication indications, refined it and merged it with the medication data. We developed an algorithm that triggered for LASA errors based on name similarity, the frequency with which a patient received a medication and whether the medication was justified by a diagnostic claim. We stratified triggers by similarity. Two clinicians reviewed a sample of charts for the presence of a true error, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. We computed specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and yield.The algorithm analysed 488 481 orders and generated 2404 triggers (0.% rate). Clinicians reviewed 506 cases and confirmed the presence of 61 errors, for an overall PPV of 12.1% (95% CI 10.7% to 13.%). It was not possible to measure sensitivity or the false-negative rate. The specificity of the algorithm varied as a  of name similarity and whether the intended and dispensed drugs shared the same route of administration.Automated detection of LASA medication errors is feasible and can reveal errors not currently detected by other means. Real-time error detection is not possible with the current system, the main  being the real-time availability of accurate diagnostic information. Further development should replicate this analysis in other health systems and on a larger set of medications and should decrease clinician time spent reviewing false-positive triggers by increasing specificity.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

We hypothesized that angiopoietin-2 (Angpt-2), antagonist of the endothelium-stabilizing receptor Tie2, induces a rapid loss of the eGC in human sepsis. Using intravital microscopy, we measured the perfused boundary region (PBR), an inverse parameter of eGC dimensions in sublingual microvessels, in patients with sepsis and age-matched nonseptic subjects. Median PBR values were significantly higher in patients compared with controls and correlated with serum Angpt-2 levels. To transfer and further explore these findings in a cell culture system, we exposed endothelial cells (ECs) to serum (%) from a subgroup of septic patients and nonseptic controls. Confocal and atomic force microscopy revealed that sepsis serum, but not control serum, induced thinning of the eGC on human ECs in vitro, which correlated with paired PBR values obtained in vivo ( = 0.96,  < 0.01). Inhibition of Angpt-2 or Tie2 activation completely abolished eGC damage. Mechanistically, sepsis-induced eGC breakdown required the loss of its main constituent heparan sulfate; a result of heparan sulfate-specific enzyme heparanase, which was suppressed by Tie2 activation. Finally, Tie2 activation, but not Angpt-2 inhibition, initiated after septic or enzymatic damage provoked rapid refurbishment of the eGC. Our data indicate that eGC breakdown in human sepsis is mediated via Tie2 deactivation by Angpt-2. Activation of Tie2 seems to accelerate recovery of the eGC and might hold promise as a therapeutic target in human sepsis.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595918>Conformational preference determined by inequivalent n-pairs: rotational studies on acetophenone and its monohydrate.</a></h2><p>Acetophenone and its complex with water have been investigated by using pulsed jet Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy complemented with quantum chemical calculations. Rotational spectra of the acetophenone monomer comprising nine isotopologues were measured and assigned, enabling the accurate structural description of the carbon skeleton. The most stable isomer of the monohydrate of acetophenone was detected in the supersonic jet expansion. Water serves as a proton donor and acceptor forming an O-HO[double bond, length as m-dash]C hydrogen bond and a secondary C-HO-H weak hydrogen bond with acetophenone through a six-membered ring. The water molecule lies almost in the plane of the aromatic ring. Bader's quantum theory of atoms in molecules, Johnson's non-covalent interaction, electron localization  and natural bond orbital analyses were applied to characterize the nature of the non-covalent interactions in the target complex. All rotational transitions are split into two components arising from the hindered methyl internal rotation. Upon the complexation, the V3  to internal rotation of -CH3 slightly decreases, with 7.50(3) kJ mol-1 for the monomer, and 7.04() kJ mol-1 for the acetophenone-H2O dimer, respectively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296910>IL-22-binding protein exacerbates influenza, bacterial super-infection.</a></h2><p>Secondary bacterial pneumonia is a significant complication of severe influenza infection and Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the primary pathogens of interest. IL-22 promotes S. aureus and S. pneumoniae host defense in the lung through epithelial integrity and induction of antimicrobial peptides and is inhibited by the soluble decoy receptor IL-22-binding protein (IL-22BP). Little is known about the effect of the IL-22/IL-22BP regulatory pathway on lung infection, and it has not been studied in the setting of super-infection. We exposed wild-type and IL-22BP mice to influenza A/PR/8/34 for 6 days prior to infection with S. aureus (USA300) S. pneumoniae. Super-infected IL-22BP mice had decreased bacterial burden and improved survival compared to controls. IL-22BP mice exhibited decreased inflammation, increased lipocalin 2 expression, and deletion of IL-22BP was associated with preserved epithelial   with evidence of improved tight junction stability. Human bronchial epithelial cells treated with IL-22Fc showed evidence of improved tight junctions compared to untreated cells.

Rab25 is highly expressed in epithelial cells of various tissues including breast, vagina, cervix, the gastrointestinal tract, and skin. Rab25 plays key roles in tumorigenesis, mainly by regulating epithelial differentiation and proliferation. However, its role in skin  is relatively unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that Rab25 knock-out (KO) mice show a skin  dysfunction with high trans-epidermal water loss and low cutaneous hydration. To examine this observation, we investigated the histology and epidermal differentiation markers of the skin in Rab25 KO mice. Rab25 KO increased cell proliferation at the basal layer of epidermis, whereas the supra-basal layer remained unaffected. Ceramide, which is a critical lipid component for skin  , was not altered by Rab25 KO in its distribution or amount, as determined by immunohistochemistry. Notably, levels of epidermal differentiation markers, including loricrin, involucrin, and keratins (, 14, 1, and 10) increased prominently in Rab25 KO mice. In line with this, depletion of Rab25 with single hairpin RNA increased the expression of differentiation markers in a human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT. Transcriptomic analysis of the skin revealed increased expression of genes associated with skin development, epidermal development, and keratinocyte differentiation in Rab25 KO mice. Collectively, these results suggested that Rab25 is involved in the regulation of epidermal differentiation and proliferation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31365873>Metabolic Deregulation of the Blood-Outer Retinal  in Retinitis Pigmentosa.</a></h2><p>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) initiates with diminished rod photoreceptor , causing peripheral and night-time vision loss. However, subsequent loss of cone  and high-resolution daylight and color vision is most debilitating. Visual pigment-rich photoreceptor outer segments (OS) undergo phagocytosis by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and the RPE also acts as a blood-outer retinal  transporting nutrients, including glucose, to photoreceptors. We provide evidence that contact between externalized phosphatidylserine (PS) on OS tips and apical RPE receptors activates Akt, linking phagocytosis with glucose transport to photoreceptors for new OS synthesis. As abundant mutant rod OS tips shorten in RP, Akt activation is lost, and onset of glucose metabolism in the RPE and diminished glucose transport combine to cause photoreceptor starvation and accompanying retinal metabolome changes. Subretinal injection of OS tip mimetics displaying PS restores Akt activation, glucose transport, and cone  in end-stage RP after rods are lost.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Various studies reported that forkhead transcription factor (Fox) O1 played a key role in anti-oxidative signaling. This study aimed to investigate the role of Stat1 in high glucose (HG) -induced podocyte injury.Under normal glucose, hypertonic and HG stimulated podocyte conditions, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, flow cytometry and western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were respectively carried out to determine cell viability, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and related genes expressions. We then respectively used silent Stat1, simultaneous silencing Stat1 and FoxO1 and over-expression of FoxO1, to observe whether they/it could reverse the damage of podocytes induced by HG.High glucose attenuated cell survival and promoted cell apoptosis in MPC- cells at the same time, and it was also observed to promote the protein expression of Stat1 and the FoxO1 expression inhibition. Silencing Stat1 could reverse HG-induced podocytes injury. Specifically, siStat1 increased cell viability, inhibited cell apoptosis and attenuated ROS level in a high-glucose environment. Cleaved caspase-3 and pro-apoptosis protein Bax was significantly down-regulated, and anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 was up-regulated by siStat1. The antioxidant genes Catalase, MnSOD, NQO1 and HO1 were up-regulated by siStat1. We found that silencing FoxO1 reversed the protective effect of siStat1 on the HG-induced podocytes injury.Silencing Stat1 could reverse the effects of high glucose-triggered low cell viability, cell apoptosis and ROS release and the functions of Stat1 might be involved in FoxO1 mediated-oxidative stress in nucleus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501002>TNF-α and IL-17A induce the expression of lympho-epithelial Kazal-type inhibitor in epidermal keratinocytes.</a></h2><p>Serine proteases have important roles in skin   and desquamation, and the aberrant expression or the dysfunction of serine proteases is associated with the pathogenesis of skin diseases. Serine protease activities are tightly regulated by serine proteases such as kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) and serine protease inhibitors such as lympho-epithelial Kazal-type related inhibitor (LEKTI). For a better understating of diseases' pathogenesis, the regulation mechanism of serine proteases and the inhibitors' expression in epidermal keratinocytes must be clarified.To investigate the effects of the cytokines on the expression of LEKTI in epidermal keratinocytes.Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) were stimulated with panels of inflammatory cytokines. The expression of serine protease inhibitors was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA. LEKTI expression in normal human skin and lesions from psoriasis or atopic dermatitis (AD) were analyzed by immunohistochemically and tape-stripping. Trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like serine protease activities in culture supernatants were measured by using specific substrates.TNF-α and IL-17A significantly induced the expression of LEKTI in NHEKs. The immunohistochemical and tape-stripping analysis revealed that psoriatic skin lesions had higher LEKTI expression compared to normal skin and AD lesions. Trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like protease activities in the culture media were upregulated 3- days later but attenuated 6-7 days later period by these cytokines.In epidermal keratinocytes, the Th1&Th17 cytokines TNF-α and IL-17A induce the expression of serine protease inhibitor LEKTI, and it might occur to suppress the increase in the serine protease activities under inflammation.Copyright © 2019 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

Resveratrol induces ameliorative effects in the treatment of certain human diseases by regulating different signaling pathways. The present study assessed the therapeutic effects of resveratrol and its potential mechanism of action in the neurons from rats with ischemia/reperfusion-induced cerebral hemorrhage. The rat model of cerebral hemorrhage was established and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, immunohistochemistry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assays were subsequently performed to assess the therapeutic effects of resveratrol. The results demonstrated that treatment with resveratrol (10 mg/kg/day) decreased cerebral water content, hippocampal cell apoptosis and cerebral infarct volume compared with the PBS-treated group. Resveratrol treatment also increased neuronal cell viability, improved neurological  and blood brain  disruption compared with the PBS group following 21 days of treatment. The administration of resveratrol was demonstrated to decrease the levels of certain inflammatory factors, including ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 and myeloperoxidase, in rats with cerebral hemorrhage. The results revealed that treatment with resveratrol regulated neuronal apoptosis by downregulating the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. In conclusion, these results indicate that resveratrol decreases ischemia/reperfusion-induced neuronal apoptosis by downregulating the TGF-β-mediated ERK pathway in a rat model of cerebral hemorrhage and may serve as a potential agent for the treatment of cerebral hemorrhage.Copyright: © Zhao et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657765>The effect of temporal adaptation to different temperatures and osmolarities on heat response of TRPV4 in cultured cells.</a></h2><p>Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channel is a polymodal receptor activated by moderate heat and hypoosmolarity. TRPV4 expressed in the skin area contributes to several skin functions as a  to maintain internal body  and a transporter of external stimuli. The skin condition such as skin temperature and osmolarity varies with internal and external changes, and may influence the activity of TRPV4 contributing to skin , thermal sensation, and thermoregulation. However, the combination effect of skin conditions such as temperature and osmolarity on the activity of TRPV4 has not been examined. In the current study, we investigated the effect of temporal adaptation (-10 min) to different temperature (25-35 °C) and osmolarity (250-350 mOsm) conditions on the heat response (until 40 °C) of human TRPV4 in cultured cells using Ca imaging. The temperature to activate TRPV4 increased with elevation of the adaptation temperature, and decreased with the adaptation to hypoosmolarity in the range of 25-35 °C. In addition, the heat response was inhibited with the adaptation to hyperosmolarity in the range of 25-35 °C. Thus, we demonstrated that the activation temperature of TRPV4 varied with the temporal sensory adaptation to different temperature and osmolarity conditions. These findings may contribute to gaining better understanding of the variation in several TRPV4-mediated skin functions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of Sb on intestinal mucosal  and intestinal flora in a colitis mouse model.Forty C57BL/6J male mice were randomly assigned to five groups: normal control group (A), pathologic control group (B), Sb treatment group (C), mesalazine treatment group (D), and Sb combined with mesalazine treatment group (E). Colitis was induced by the addition of 2.% (wt/vol) dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in the drinking water ad libitum for 7 days. The general condition, weight change, stool property, and bloody stool level of mice were observed to evaluate the disease activity index. The expression of zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin in intestinal tissue were measured by immunohistochemistry. The level of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-8 in plasma was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Inter-cellular tight junctions were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The feces and intestinal contents were collected sterilely, and intestinal flora was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing.Compared with group B, Sb reduced the disease activity index and histological score of group C (disease activity index: group B 2.708 ± 0.628, group C 1.542 ± 0.616, PBC = 0.005; histological score: group B 9.875 ± 3.271, group C 4.750 ± 1.832, PBC = 0.005) in DSS-induced colitis in mice. Sb exerted a protect effect on the expression of ZO-1 (group B 2.075 ± 1.176, group C 4.225 ± 1.316, PBC = 0.019) and occludin (group B 2.200 ± 0.968, group C 3.525 ± 1.047, PBC = 0.023).

The missing consensus about CSF data interpretation prevents reliable conclusions. This can be overcome by a theory-based hyperbolic reference range in CSF/serum quotient diagrams.Mean Quotients for FLC-K, Q, and albumin, QAlb, of grouped, biochemically defined controls (N = 433) are fitted with the hyperbolic  Q(mean) = a/b (QAlb + b) - c by a generally applicable procedure excluding outliers.With Q(mean), the coefficient of variation CV (22.%) and the reference range (Q(mean) ± 3 CV) we got the discrimination line Q(lim) = (3.27(QAlb + 33)-8.2) ×10 in a FLC-K Reibergram. Intrathecal FLC-K was found in 8% of another control group without OCB (N = 388) but was missed in 7% of patients with definite Multiple sclerosis (N = 95). In MS the mean intrathecal fraction was threefold larger for FLC-K (95%) compared to total IgG (36%). Similar mean quantities of intrathecal FLC-K contradict an immunological conversion between a Clinically isolated syndrome and MS.The hyperbolic reference range is superior to linear FLC-K Index (10 to 15% false negatives) and exponential curves (30% false positive interpretations for controls) in the analytical range of MS data, with excellent data fit for up to ten-fold larger QAlb values.

The concentration of LAE and the addition of a suitable plasticizer (glycerol or oleic acid (OA)) were the main variables considered. Active plasticized zein films, with glycerol or oleic acid were characterized in terms of release kinetics, mechanical, , optical, and antimicrobial properties. Results showed that active agent concentration, ( and 10%), had no-significant effect on mechanical and WVP properties of the plasticized films. Films plasticized with OA presented greater water resistance, UV-light opacity, and water  properties than glycerol-plasticized films. On the contrary, the latter had better antimicrobial properties. The analysis of LAE release kinetics from films to different food simulants revealed different behaviours, depending on both film formulation and food simulant. Despite the lower water resistance of coatings containing glycerol, bags based on polypropylene/glycerol plasticized zein containing 10% of LAE presented a great antimicrobial activity in tests with chicken soup (real food system) contaminated with pathogen bacteria, concretely, the films showed 3.21 Log reduction against Listeria monocytogenes and 3.07 log reductions against Escherichia coli.

Water contact angles of the resulting films could be tuned from <° (superhydrophilic) to >135° (very hydrophobic) by adjusting the AA/PMA feed ratio and/or via postdeposition exposure of films to an Ar/O plasma treatment.

Hybrid hydrophilic/phobic patterns at submillimeter length scales, and philic/phobic/philic laminates were produced using a shadow mask and sequential deposition, respectively. Chemical heterogeneity of films was assessed using XPS, SIMS, and micro-IR imaging and suggest that localization of COOH and OH groups are primarily responsible for hydrophilicity.

This study evaluated the effects of a chemically characterized OLE in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity in mice, describing the underlying mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects, with special attention to vascular dysfunction and gut microbiota composition.C57BL/6J mice were distributed in different groups: control, control-treated, obese and obese-treated with OLE (1, 10 and 25 mg/kg/day). Control mice received a standard diet, whereas obese mice were fed HFD. The treatment was followed for  weeks, and animal body weight periodically assessed. At the end of the treatment, metabolic plasma analysis (including lipid profile) as well as glucose and insulin levels were performed. The HFD-induced inflammatory status was studied in liver and fat, by determining the RNA expression of different inflammatory mediators by qPCR; also, different markers of intestinal epithelial   were determined in colonic tissue by qPCR. Additionally, flow cytometry of immune cells from adipose tissue, endothelial dysfunction in aortic rings as well as gut microbiota composition were evaluated. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to antibiotic-treated mice fed with HFD was performed.OLE administration reduced body weight gain, basal glycaemia and insulin resistance, and showed improvement in plasma lipid profile when compared with HFD-fed mice. The extract significantly ameliorated the HFD-induced altered expression of key adipogenic genes, like PPARs, adiponectin and leptin receptor, in adipose tissue. Furthermore, the extract reduced the RNA expression of Tnf-α, Il-1β, Il-6 in liver and adipose tissue, thus improving the tissue inflammatory status associated to obesity. The flow cytometry analysis in adipose tissue corroborated these observations. Additionally, the characterization of the colonic microbiota by sequencing showed that OLE administration was able to counteract the dysbiosis associated to obesity. The extract reversed the endothelial dysfunction observed in the aortic rings of obese mice. FMT from donors HFD-OLE to recipient mice fed an HFD prevented the development of obesity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction.OLE exerts beneficial effects in HFD-induced obesity in mice, which was associated to an improvement in plasma and tissue metabolic profile, inflammatory status, gut microbiota composition and vascular dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Because it is not clear whether β-carotene suppresses inflammation in AD skin tissues, we examined the effects of oral administration of β-carotene in mice induced by a low zinc/magnesium diet (HR-AD diet). Our studies found that AD-like inflammation was remarkably reduced by β-carotene. In addition, β-carotene significantly suppressed protein expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and MCP-1 and mRNA expression of TSLP, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-, and Par-2 in AD-like skin tissues. It was also found that mRNA and protein expression of filaggrin (a major structural protein in epidermis) in AD-like skin was significantly elevated by β-carotene administration. Furthermore, β-carotene treatment significantly reduced the activity and/or mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), degradation of the extracellular matrix and regulation of chemokines. These results suggest that β-carotene reduces skin inflammation through the suppressed expression of inflammatory factors or the activity of MMPs as well as the promotion of filaggrin expression in AD-like skin. β-Carotene is a potent anti-inflammatory agent, which improves AD-like skin by enhancing the skin  .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611906>Exosomal Circular RNA as a Biomarker Platform for the Early Diagnosis of Immune-Mediated Demyelinating Disease.</a></h2><p>Exosomes can pass through the blood-brain  and are present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The components in exosomes, such as DNA, RNA, protein, and lipids, change greatly and are closely related to disease progression. Circular RNA (circRNA) is stable in structure and has a long half-life in exosomes without degradation. Therefore, circRNA is considered an ideal biomarker and can be used to monitor a variety of central nervous system diseases. This study aimed to investigate the expression profiles of exosomal circRNA (exo-circRNA) in CSF from patients with immune-mediated demyelinating diseases to identify suitable biomarkers for the early diagnosis of immune-mediated demyelinating diseases. circRNA expression levels in exosomes obtained from five CSF samples from immune-mediated demyelinating disease patients and five paired CSF control samples were analyzed using a hybridization array. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that ,095 exo-circRNAs were differentially expressed between patients with immune-mediated demyelinating diseases and paired control samples. Of these exo-circRNAs, 26 were identified as significantly differentially expressed in CSF exosomes from patients with immune-mediated demyelinating diseases (FC ≥1. and p ≤ 0.05). Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis indicated that the upregulation or activation of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type F (PTPRF) and RAD23 homolog B, nucleotide excision repair protein (RAD23B) may be associated with the occurrence and development of immune-mediated demyelinating diseases. Then, a competing endogenous RNA network was constructed and centered on the most upregulated/downregulated exo-circRNAs to predict their  in immune-mediated demyelinating diseases. In addition, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction results stating that hsa_circ_0087862 and hsa_circ_0012077 were validated in an independent cohort of subjects. Canonical correlation analysis results indicated a potential connection between exosomal hsa_circ_0012077 expression level and immunoglobulin G levels in CSF. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that when hsa_circ_0087862 or hsa_circ_0012077 was employed alone for diagnosing immune-mediated demyelinating diseases, the diagnostic accuracy was 100%. In conclusion, based on this study, exosomal hsa_circ_0087862 and hsa_circ_0012077 in CSF could be used as suitable biomarkers for the diagnosis of immune-mediated demyelinating disease based on their expression levels. Moreover, the upregulation or activation of PTPRF and RAD23B was potentially associated with the occurrence and development of immune-mediated demyelinating diseases.Copyright © 2019 He, Ren, Li, Yang, Wang and Yang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643113>Piezotronic Tunneling Junction Gated by Mechanical Stimuli.</a></h2><p>Tunneling junction is used in many devices such as high-frequency oscillators, nonvolatile memories, and magnetic field sensors. In these devices, modulation on the  width and/or height is usually realized by electric field or magnetic field. Here, a new piezotronic tunneling junction (PTJ) principle, in which the quantum tunneling is controlled/tuned by externally applied mechanical stimuli, is proposed. In these metal/insulator/piezoelectric semiconductor PTJs, such as Pt/Al O /p-GaN, the height and the width of the tunneling barriers can be mechanically modulated via the piezotronic effect. The tunneling current characteristics of PTJs exhibit critical behavior as a  of external mechanical stimuli, which results in high sensitivity (≈.59 mV MPa ), giant switching (>10 ), and fast response (≈4.38 ms). Moreover, the mechanical controlling of tunneling transport in PTJs with various thickness of Al O is systematically investigated. The high performance observed with these metal/insulator/piezoelectric semiconductor PTJs suggest their great potential in electromechanical technology. This study not only demonstrates dynamic mechanical controlling of quantum tunneling, but also paves a way for adaptive interaction between quantum tunneling and mechanical stimuli, with potential applications in the field of ultrasensitive press sensor, human-machine interface, and artificial intelligence.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of Qingjie Fuzheng Granule (QFG) on -FU-induced intestinal mucositis in CT-26 tumor-bearing xenograft mice and investigated the possible molecular mechanism.Tumor xenograft models of CT-26 cells were generated in BALB/c nude mice, the mice were randomly divided into 4 groups including control, QFG, -FU and -FU combined QFG groups. The body weight, volume of tumor and diarrhea score of each group were recorded daily. On the fifth day, the blood of mice was collected, the mice were subsequently euthanized and their thymus, spleen, intestine and tumor were removed for the following analysis.QFG alleviated severe diarrhea and reversed the decrease in the number of white blood cell including granulocyte and lymphocyte induced by -FU. QFG could also significantly improve -FU-induced several intestinal mucosal damages, and characterized by integrity villus and crypts, the reduction of necrotic cells. QFG decreased the serum levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and increased the levels of IL-10. Furthermore, QFG inhibited the cellular apoptosis in the jejunum tissue caused by -FU via the increasing Bcl-2 expression and decreasing Bax expression. In addition, QFG promoted the cell proliferation via elevating the expression of Cyclin D1 and CDK4 and reducing p21 expression. Meanwhile, QFG could not further impact on the cell apoptosis and proliferation of tumors caused by -FU.QFG attenuated the intestinal mucositis and diarrhea induced by -FU via preventive effect on inflammation and its improvement of the intestinal  , inhibiting cell apoptosis and promoting cell proliferation, and without affecting the -FU treatment efficiency. The results suggest that QFG may act as a potential agent against chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucositis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

The leakage of BBB contributes to the infiltration of peripheral immune cells and harmful mediators into brain parenchyma, even the drugs that can not cross BBB under physiological conditions. Therefore, PD has been regarded as not only a neurodegenerative disease, but also a systemic disorder. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that Dexrazoxane (Dex), a drug clinically used to reduce doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in chemotherapy, can enter into midbrain and striatum through broken BBB in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)- and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced rodent models of PD. Unexpectedly, Dex (1., , 15 mg/kg, i.p.) administration for 3-week significantly ameliorates apomorphine-induced contralateral rotation behavior in 6-OHDA-treated rats and Dex (10 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment for -week improves MPTP-induced mouse motor dysfunctions. We find that Dex administration protects dopaminergic neurons against neurotoxin-induced degeneration in SNc, accompanied by the attenuated glial cell activation. Further study indicates that suppression of oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, as well as the inhibition of systemic inflammation in both peripheral tissues and brain, contribute to the neuroprotective effects of Dex in PD models. Our study implies that Dex may serve as an effective neuroprotectant to treat neurodegeneration and has potential clinical value in term of PD therapeutics.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

This study reports novel mechanisms through which a conductive Hf:ZnO (HZO) film by atomic layer deposition (ALD) can be integrated with a sprayed Ag NWs film to address the issues of Ag NWs. First, the ALD surface reactions can induce fusing of the Ag NWs into a connected network without the need for a thermal sintering process. Second, the ALD process can in situ functionalize the Ag NWs to yield defect-free (in terms of blocking gas permeation) coverage of the ALD HZO over the entire nanowire surfaces, which also enhances the ALD-induced fusing of Ag NWs. The composite HZO/Ag NWs films exhibit low sheet resistance (15 Ω sq), low water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) (.1 × 10 g m day), high optical transmission (92%), excellent flexibility (12. mm bending radius), high stability/durability (against an extensive set of degradation modes and photolithographic patterning processes), and low processing temperature (90 °C) and can be used in perovskite solar cells to obtain high power conversion efficiency (14.46%).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31362539>Blood Flow Deficits and Cerebrovascular Changes in a Dietary Model of Hyperhomocysteinemia.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665089>Impact of Docetaxel on blood-brain   and formation of breast cancer brain metastases.</a></h2><p>Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequent malignant tumor in females and the 2nd most common cause of brain metastasis (BM), that are associated with a fatal prognosis. The increasing incidence from 10% up to 40% is due to more effective treatments of extracerebral sites with improved prognosis and increasing use of MRI in diagnostics. A frequently administered, potent chemotherapeutic group of drugs for BC treatment are taxanes usually used in the adjuvant and metastatic setting, which, however, have been suspected to be associated with a higher incidence of BM. The aim of our study was to experimentally analyze the impact of the taxane docetaxel (DTX) on brain metastasis formation, and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism.A monocentric patient cohort was analyzed to determine the association of taxane treatment and BM formation. To identify the specific impact of DTX, a murine brain metastatic model upon intracardial injection of breast cancer cells was conducted. To approach the functional mechanism, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and electron microscopy of mice as well as in-vitro transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and tracer permeability assays using brain endothelial cells (EC) were carried out. PCR-based, immunohistochemical and immunoblotting analyses with additional RNA sequencing of murine and human ECs were performed to explore the molecular mechanisms by DTX treatment.Taxane treatment was associated with an increased rate of BM formation in the patient cohort and the murine metastatic model. Functional studies did not show unequivocal alterations of blood-brain  properties upon DTX treatment in-vivo, but in-vitro assays revealed a temporary DTX-related  disruption. We found disturbance of tubulin structure and upregulation of tight junction marker claudin- in ECs. Furthermore, upregulation of several members of the tubulin family and downregulation of tetraspanin-2 in both, murine and human ECs, was induced.In summary, a higher incidence of BM was associated with prior taxane treatment in both a patient cohort and a murine mouse model. We could identify tubulin family members and tetraspanin-2 as potential contributors for the destabilization of the blood-brain .

Here, we characterized vectorial release of apical and basolateral MPs (AMPs and BMPs) from control and TNF-α/IFN-γ treated human brain endothelial monolayers, studied molecular composition of AMPs and BMPs and characterized molecular pathways regulating AMP and BMP release. The effects of AMPs and BMPs on blood-brain  properties and human brain microvascular smooth muscle tonic contractility  were also evaluated. We report that human brain microvascular endothelial cells release MPs both apically and basolaterally with both AMP and BMP release significantly increased following inflammatory cytokine challenge (3.-fold and 3.9-fold vs. control, respectively). AMPs and BMPs both carry proteins derived from parent cells including those in BBB junctions (Claudin-1, -3, -, occludin, VE-cadherin). AMPs and BMPs represent distinct populations whose release appears to be regulated by distinctly separate molecular pathways, which depend on signaling from Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK), calpain as well as cholesterol depletion. AMPs and BMPs modulate functions of neighboring cells including BBB endothelial solute permeability and brain vascular smooth muscle contractility. While control AMPs enhanced brain endothelial , cytokine-induced AMPs impaired BBB. Cytokine-induced but not control BMPs significantly impaired human brain smooth muscle contractility as early as day 1. Taken together these results indicate that AMPs and BMPs may contribute to neurovascular inflammatory disease progression both within the circulation (AMP) and in the brain parenchyma (BMP).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31512246>A human skin model to evaluate the protective effect of compounds against UVA damage.</a></h2><p>The main  of skin is to protect the body from external aggressions. Over time, normal skin aging is accelerated by external stresses such as smoking, pollution, chemical products and radiation. UV light, in particular UVA, causes DNA damage, apoptosis and morphological modifications, which are responsible for both premature aging and cancer. The aim of this study was to establish a discriminatory and sufficiently reproducible cutaneous model for evaluating UVA damage, to enable testing for effectiveness of potentially protective compounds.The cutaneous model is based on Human skin explants irradiated with UVA. Deleterious effects on epidermis were observed and quantified by haematoxylin-eosin staining and by immunofluorescence of ɣ-H2Ax, cytokeratin , involucrin and loricrin protein. Dermis deterioration was evaluated by transmission electronic microscopy and zymography in situ.We were able to observe and quantify deleterious effects associated with UVA irradiation: epidermal and dermal disruption, appearance of Sunburn cells, increased DNA damage and induced apoptosis. The use of this model in the evaluation of protective compounds was first confirmed using sunscreens, then further validated with a panel of active ingredients which showed beneficial effects on epidermis morphology and DNA integrity after UVA exposure.We have developed a model and a standardised protocol, based on the use of human skin explants, which allows us to explore the protective effect of active ingredients to environmental stresses such as UVA.This article is protected by copyright.

Platelets adhesion on amyloid plaques also increases the risk of cerebral microcirculation disorders. Moreover, activated platelets release soluble adhesion molecules that cause migration, adhesion/activation of neutrophils and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which may damage blood brain  and destroy brain parenchyma. The present study examined the effects of intermittent hypoxic-hyperoxic training (IHHT) on elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor of AD. Twenty-one participants (age 51-74 years) were divided into three groups: Healthy Control ( = 7), MCI+Sham ( = 6), and MCI+IHHT ( = 8). IHHT was carried out five times per week for three weeks (total 15 sessions). Each IHHT session consisted of four cycles of -min hypoxia (12% FO) and 3-min hyperoxia (33% FO). Cognitive parameters, Aβ and amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression, microRNA 29, and long non-coding RNA in isolated platelets as well as NETs in peripheral blood were investigated. We found an initial decline in cognitive  indices in both MCI+Sham and MCI+IHHT groups and significant correlations between cognitive test scores and the levels of circulating biomarkers of AD. Whereas sham training led to no change in these parameters, IHHT resulted in the improvement in cognitive test scores, along with significant increase in APP ratio and decrease in Aβ expression and NETs formation one day after the end of three-week IHHT. Such effects on Aβ expression and NETs formation remained more pronounced one month after IHHT. In conclusion, our results from this pilot study suggested a potential utility of IHHT as a new non-pharmacological therapy to improve cognitive  in pre-AD patients and slow down the development of AD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31584756>Two-dimensional sandwich-like α-zirconium phosphate/polypyrrole: moderate catalysis  and efficient true-sulfur-confinement for high performance lithium-sulfur batteries.</a></h2><p>Although lithium-sulfur battery is a promising energy storage device with high energy density, environmental friendliness and low cost, many obstacles such as poor conductivity, volume expansion and "shuttle effect" still limit their large-scale commercialization. In this work, a two-dimensional (2D) sandwich-like α-ZrP/polypyrrole (α-ZrP/PPy) material with a nanosheet structure is designed for the sulfur hosting. It is found that such a material can provide unique ion transfer channels for the rapid Li + ions transfer and thusly catalytically promote the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion. Moreover, the α-ZrP nanosheet provides a true-chemical anchor for sulfur species while the PPy helps to build a physical  and form a conductive network for accelerating the electron transport and finally promoting the electrochemical performance. In addition, the moderate catalysis  and efficient true-sulfur-confinement effect of α-ZrP are confirmed by experiments as well as theoretical computations. As a result, α-ZrP/PPy@S cathode exhibits a highly reversible capacity of 727.2 mA·h·g -1 even at a high current density of  C, offering a novel cathode material for the high performance Li-S batteries.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Paracellular permeability is governed by intercellular tight-junctions (TJs). Zonulin is, to date, the only known physiological regulator of intestinal TJs. We used a zonulin transgenic mouse (Ztm) model characterized by increased small intestinal permeability to elucidate the role of a primary impaired gut  on microbiome composition and/or immune profile. Ztm exhibit an altered gene expression profile of TJs in the gut compared to wild-type mice (WT): Claudin-15, Claudin-, Jam-3, and Myosin-1C are decreased in the male duodenum whereas Claudin-15, Claudin-7, and ZO-2 are reduced in the female colon. These results are compatible with loss of gut   and are paralleled by an altered microbiota composition with reduced abundance of the genus , known to have positive effects on gut  integrity and strengthening, and an increased abundance of the  genus, associated to low-grade inflammatory conditions. Immune profile analysis shows a subtly skewed distribution of immune cell subsets toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype with more IL-17 producing adaptive and innate-like T cells in Ztm. Interestingly, microbiota "normalization" involving the transfer of WT microbiota into Ztm, did not rescue the altered immune profile. Our data suggest that a primary impaired gut  causing an uncontrolled trafficking of microbial products leads to a latent pro-inflammatory status, with a skewed microbiota composition and immune profile that, in the presence of an environmental trigger, as we have previously described (1), might promote the onset of overt inflammation and an increased risk of chronic disease.Copyright © 2019 Miranda-Ribera, Ennamorati, Serena, Cetinbas, Lan, Sadreyev, Jain, Fasano and Fiorentino.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31584781>A Global Review on the Risk Factors and Management of Early Atopic Dermatitis in Children Ages 0 to 2 Years Old</a></h2><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing skin disease starting typically in atopic-prone children between 3–6 months of age, with most children having developed AD by the age of  years. Intense itching leads to sleep disturbance, especially in younger children and toddlers. This review explores early intervention in infants and young children with AD by controlling skin   and inflammation at the earliest time point using a moisturizer and a proactive treatment.A working group of experienced clinicians managing pediatric populations with AD convened for a meeting. The panel reviewed the literature surrounding early intervention in infants and young children with AD and developed and discussed clinical questions aimed at optimizing clinical outcomes.Complex gene/immune system/environment interactions are involved in AD development. Epidermal  defects play a central role in the condition, with various studies showing impairment of skin   at birth may precede clinical AD. Dynamic changes take place in the amounts of skin lipids during infancy. Studies confirm that daily use of a moisturizer from birth onwards may offer benefits in improving skin   and possibly prevention of AD, especially in high-risk, atopic prone newborns. Plant-based moisturizers were shown to be safe and effective when applied in pediatric patients with AD and may provide a TCS-sparing effect while improving skin condition.Dry skin conditions during infancy may predict the subsequent development of AD. Consequently, emollient therapy from birth represents a feasible, safe, and effective approach for AD prevention. Therefore, parental education and the application of moisturizers are recommended as an integral part of AD prevention, treatment, and maintenance.

Thirty-six 8-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were collected and divided into normal control group (=6) and scald group (=30) according to random number table. Back of each mouse in scald group was placed into hot water of 90 ℃ for 10 s, causing full-thickness scald (hereinafter refer to as burn) of 30% total body surface area, while mice in normal control group were not inflicted with burns. Six mice in normal control group were taken, and 6 mice in scald group at 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h post injury were taken respectively.

The objective was to evaluate the effects of early enteral glutamine supplementation on intestinal permeability in critically ill patients.A total of 80 critically ill patients older than 18 years were randomly assigned to one of two groups according to the stratified blocked randomization by age and admission category. Consecutive participants took enteral formula plus 0.3 g/kg/day glutamine powder or enteral formula plus maltodextrin during the ICU stay for a maximum of 10 days. Plasma glutamine, endotoxin, zonulin, and antiendotoxin immunoglobulin (Ig)G/IgM concentrations were measured on days  and 10 of intervention.Out of 80 participants, 36 patients in the glutamine group and 34 patients in the control group were included in the analysis of the outcomes. Enteral glutamine significantly reduced plasma zonulin concentration up to 40% during 10 days. This reduction was significantly greater compared with that of the placebo group (<0.001).

Drugs are by far the most common cause of toxic epidermal necrolysis, in which large sheets of skin are lost from the body surface making redundant the   of the skin, with its resultant complications. Drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis are severe adverse cutaneous drug reactions to various precipitating agents that predominantly involve the skin and mucous membranes. Toxic epidermal necrolysis is rare but considered medical emergencies as they are potentially fatal. Drugs are the most common cause accounting for about 65%-80% of the cases. The most common offending agents are sulfonamides, NSAIDs, butazones and hydrantoins. An immune mechanism is implicated in the pathogenesis, but its nature is still unclear. There is a prodormal phase in which there is burning sensation all over the skin and conjunctivae, along with skin tenderness, fever, malaise and arthralgias. Early sites of cutaneous involvement are the presternal region of the trunk and the face, but also the palms and soles, rapidly spread to their maximum extent, the oral mucosa and conjunctiva being affected. Initial lesions are macular, followed by desquamateion, or may be from atypical targets with purpuriccenters that coalesce, from bullae, then slough. The earlier a causative agent is withdrawn the better is the prognosis. Several treatment modalities given in addition to supportive care are reported in the literature, such as systemicsteroids, high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins, ciclosporin, TNF antagonists. Recovery is slow over a period of 14-28 days and relapses are frequent. Mortality is 25%-50% and half the deaths occur due to secondary infection. Here we report a 50-year-old female of drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis. She was admitted to the dermatology ward with extensive peeling of skin over the trunk and limbs. She had taken alamotrigine for epilepsy. A week after taking the tablets, the patient developed a severe burning sensation all over the body and followed by a polymorphic erythematous dermatitis and widespread peeling of skin. We treated this patient with high dose corticosteroids, high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins and etanercept, but eventually she died of secondary aspergillus fumigatus infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31275319>Dietary Resistant Potato Starch Alters Intestinal Microbial Communities and Their Metabolites, and Markers of Immune Regulation and   in Swine.</a></h2><p>Interactions between diet, the microbiota, and the host set the ecological conditions in the gut and have broad implications for health. Prebiotics are dietary compounds that may shift conditions toward health by promoting the growth of beneficial microbes that produce metabolites capable of modulating host cells. This study's objective was to assess how a dietary prebiotic could impact host tissues via modulation of the intestinal microbiota. Pigs fed a diet amended with % resistant potato starch (RPS) exhibited alterations associated with gut health relative to swine fed an unamended control diet (CON). RPS intake increased abundances of anaerobic  in feces and several tissues, as well as intestinal concentrations of butyrate. Functional gene amplicons suggested bacteria similar to  were stimulated by RPS intake. The CON treatment exhibited increased abundances of several genera of  (which utilize respiratory metabolisms) in several intestinal locations. RPS intake increased the abundance of regulatory T cells in the cecum, but not periphery, and cecal immune status alterations were indicative of enhanced mucosal defenses. A network analysis of host and microbial changes in the cecum revealed that regulatory T cells positively correlated with butyrate concentration, luminal IgA concentration, expression of IL-6 and DEF1B, and several mucosa-associated bacterial taxa. Thus, the administration of RPS modulated the microbiota and host immune status, altering markers of cecal   and immunological tolerance, and suggesting a reduced niche for bacterial respiration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31446576>Da-Cheng-Qi Decoction () Combined with Lactobacillus Acidophilus Improves Gastrointestinal  of Traumatic Brain-Injured Model Mice.</a></h2><p>To investigate the effects of Da-Cheng-Qi Decoction (DCQD, ) combined with Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) on the recovery of gastrointestinal (GI)  in traumatic brain-injured (TBI) mice.A total of 150 male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into sham-injury, normal saline (NS), DCQD (0.4 mL/day), LA (⩾1 × 10 cfu/day LA), DCQD+LA (LA administration at the same dosage after 4 h of feeding DCQD), and ½ DCQD+LA groups (LA administration at the same dosage after 4 h of feeding ½ DCQD dose) by a random number table, -8 mice in each group. The sever TBI model was constructed according to Feeney's enhanced gravitational forces of free falling. On days 1, 3, and 7 post-TBI, plasma diamine oxidase (DAO) and D-lactic acid levels were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Occludin expression in the intestinal epithelium was assessed by Western blot analysis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe the morphological changes in the network structure of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) and change of enteric nervous system-ICC-smooth muscle cell (ENS-ICC-SMC). Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect changes in the network structure of the ICC.Compared with the NS group, occludin expression in the DCQD+LA group significantly increased on Day 1, 3, and 7 post-TBI (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The concentration of DAO significantly decreased in the LA, DCQD, and DCQD+LA groups on Day 3 and 7, whilst the D-lactate concentrations in the LA and ½ DCQD+LA groups decreased on Day 1 and 3 post-injury (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The NS group experienced a great damage on the ENS-ICC-SMC network morphology and ICC network structure, and all treatment groups had some improvements, among which the DCQD+LA group presented relatively intact network morphology.DCQD combined with LA treatment could effectively repair the intestinal mucosal  and improve GI motility in mice after TBI. The combination of DCQD and LA was more effective than their respective monotherapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31371354>Manganese-Enhanced MRI of the Brain in Healthy Volunteers.</a></h2><p>The manganese ion is used as an intracellular MR imaging contrast agent to study neuronal  in animal models, but it remains unclear whether manganese-enhanced MR imaging can be similarly useful in humans. Using mangafodipir (Teslascan, a chelated manganese-based contrast agent that is FDA-approved), we evaluated the dynamics of manganese enhancement of the brain and glandular structures in the rostral head and neck in healthy volunteers.We administered mangafodipir intravenously at a rate of 1 mL/minute for a total dose of  μmol/kg body weight. Nine healthy adult volunteers (6 men/3 women; median age, 43 years) completed baseline history and physical examination, 3T MR imaging, and blood work. MR imaging also followed mangafodipir administration at various time points from immediate to 7 days, with delayed scans at 1-3 months.The choroid plexus and anterior pituitary gland enhanced within 10 minutes of infusion, with enhancement persisting up to 7 and 30 days, respectively. Exocrine (parotid, submandibular, sublingual, and lacrimal) glands also enhanced avidly as early as 1 hour postadministration, generally resolving by 1 month; 3 volunteers had residual exocrine gland enhancement, which resolved by 2 months in 1 and by 3 months in the other 2. Mangafodipir did not affect clinical parameters, laboratory values, or T1-weighted signal in the basal ganglia.Manganese ions released from mangafodipir successfully enable noninvasive visualization of intra- and extracranial structures that lie outside the blood-brain  without adverse clinical effects, setting the stage for future neuroradiologic investigation in disease.© 2019 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31423661>Low Methoxyl Pectin Protects against Autoimmune Diabetes and Associated Caecal Dysfunction.</a></h2><p>This study aims to examine the protective effects of specific low-methoxyl pectin (LMP) on the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D).Female non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice are weaned onto either control or % LMP supplemented diets for up to 22 weeks of age. T1D incidence, gut  , and pancreatic-gut immune responses are analyzed. LMP supplementation significantly dampened the onset of T1D in NOD mice. LMP supplementation induces caecal homeostasis, as indicated by the increasing SCFAs production, higher expression of tight junction proteins claudin 1, zonula occludens-2 in caecum. Furthermore, LMP-mediated caecal homeostasis impacts gut-pancreatic immunity, as evidenced by increased regulatory T cell population, modulated inflammatory cytokine expression, and suppressed NOD like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation in both caecum and pancreas.The data demonstrate that LMP limits T1D development by inducing caecal homeostasis to shape pancreatic immune environment, providing a scientific basis for using LMP as a novel functional supplementation to intervene T1D.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Realizing such practical applications often requires metal-TMD connections or contacts. Hence, a complete understanding of electronic band alignments and potential  heights governing the transport through metal-TMD junctions is critical. However, it is presently unclear how the energy bands of a TMD align while in contact with a metal as a  of the number of layers. In pursuit of removing this knowledge gap, we have performed conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) of few-layered (1 to  layers) MoS immobilized on ultraflat conducting Au surfaces [root-mean-square (rms) surface roughness < 0.2 nm] and indium-tin oxide (ITO) substrates (rms surface roughness < 0.7 nm) forming a vertical metal (CAFM tip)-semiconductor-metal device. We have observed that the current increases with the number of layers up to five layers. By applying Fowler-Nordheim tunneling theory, we have determined the  heights for different layers and observed how this  decreases as the number of layers increases. Using density functional theory calculations, we successfully demonstrated that the  height decreases as the layer number increases. By illuminating TMDs on a transparent ultraflat conducting ITO substrate, we observed a reduction in current when compared to the current measured in the dark, hence demonstrating negative photoconductivity. Our study provides a fundamental understanding of the local electronic and optoelectronic behaviors of the TMD-metal junction, which depends on the numbers of TMD layers and may pave an avenue toward developing nanoscale electronic devices with tailored layer-dependent transport properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474856>Baicalein Mitigates Radiation-Induced Enteritis by Improving Endothelial Dysfunction.</a></h2><p> Radiation-induced intestinal injury occurred in application of radiotherapy for abdominal and pelvic cancers or in nuclear accidents. Radiation-induced enteritis may be considered an ideal model of gastrointestinal inflammation. The endothelium is a crucial component of inflammation, and the endothelial dysfunction following radiation exposure induces the intestinal proinflammatory response and progression of radiation enteritis. Baicalein (,6,7-trihydroxyflavonoid) is a flavonoid from  used in oriental herbal medicine. Baicalein has been found to have multiple beneficial properties including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, and anti-cancer activities. Here, we investigated the therapeutic effects of baicalein on endothelial dysfunction in radiation-induced intestinal inflammation.  We performed histological analysis, bacterial translocation, and intestinal permeability assays and also assessed infiltration of leukocytes and inflammatory cytokine expression using a mouse model of radiation-induced enteritis. In addition, to investigate the effect of baicalein in endothelial dysfunction, we analyzed endothelial-derived adherent molecules in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and irradiated intestinal tissue.  Histological damage such as shortening of villi length and impaired intestinal crypt  was observed in the radiation-induced enteritis mouse model. Intestinal damage was attenuated in baicalein-treated groups with improvement of intestinal  . Baicalein inhibited the expression of radiation-induced adherent molecules in HUVECs and intestine of irradiated mouse and decreased leukocyte infiltration in the radiation-induced enteritis.  Baicalein could accelerate crypt regeneration  recovery of endothelial damage. Therefore, baicalein has a therapeutic effect on radiation-induced intestinal inflammation by attenuating endothelial damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572002>Impact of antiviral therapy with nucleos(t)ide analog on survival of patients with HBV-related small hepatocellular carcinomas.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading causes of cancer-related death. HCC is usually based on chronic liver disease, mainly including chronic hepatitis C virus infection or chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of the nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) use on the prognosis of patients with HBV-related small hepatocellular carcinomas (HBV-SHCC).In this retrospective study, there were 134 patients who had been treated with long-term NA before SHCC diagnosis as NA-experienced group, 43 patients received NA-naïve treatment after SHCC diagnosis as NA-naïve group, and 15 patients who did not receive NA treatment as untreated group. Among these patients, some patients underwent surgical resection and others with local recurrence were treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), TACE-percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy or TACE alone. The Kaplan-Meier and Cox-proportional hazard model were used to calculate the survival analysis.The data showed that 1-year, 3-year, -year overall survival rate of HBV-SHCC patients in NA-experienced group were 90.27%, 90.69%, 65%, NA-naïve group were 70.81%, 73.95%, 47.39%, and untreated group were 54.96%, 40.44%, 47.39%, respectively (Log-rank, =0.031). The median survival time of HBV-SHCC patients treated with adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) or LAM+ADV has the longest survival time. Patients who have received rescue treatment after viral breakthrough or gotten maintained viral response had longer survival times than those who have not received rescue treatment after viral breakthrough or non-response. Compared with timely rescue treatment, viral breakthrough (hazard ratio=3.624, 95% CI, 1.035-12.687, =0.044) was an independent risk factor for HBV-SHCC patients with Cox-proportional hazard model. For these patients conforming to NA-treatment indications, commencement of NA treatment should be given even after HBV-SHCC diagnosis. Moreover, HBV-SHCC patients who were suffering from virus break through should be treated timely rescue therapy even if their liver  was normal.SHCC patients treated with low drug resistance  drugs may not change the treatment regimen if they have gotten virological response.© 2019 Wei et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309600>Clinical and in vitro evaluation of new anti-redness cosmetic products in subjects with winter xerosis and sensitive skin.</a></h2><p>To demonstrate the in vitro activities of panthenol, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), and niacinamide (NAM) and determine the biophysical properties, clinical safety, tolerability together with efficacy of two developmental anti-redness (AR) formulations containing these ingredients, in alleviating facial redness associated with winter xerosis in healthy volunteers with sensitive skin.The anti-inflammatory and skin protective properties of panthenol, PEA and NAM were evaluated in vitro. The physical properties of the AR formulations were analysed using measurement of water vapour transport rate (WVTR) and infrared spectroscopy. Clinical studies were performed between the months of December and April (2014-15) with efficacy assessed during the winter. Facial redness, irritation, sensitization potential, photo-irritation, and photo-sensitization were evaluated. Self-assessed adverse reactions were reported in diaries of use.Panthenol and PEA reduced prostaglandin E , interleukin-6, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin levels in vitro, while NAM induced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) levels and the keratinocyte differentiation markers: filaggrin (2-fold increase, p < 0.001), loricrin (2-fold increase, p <0.05), involucrin (2 fold increase, p < 0.001) & peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor-alpha (1. fold increase, p < 0.05). The two AR products exhibited low WVTR (include changes and stats) and displayed an ordered lipid structure. The day cream formulation protected against ultraviolet B radiation in vitro. A total of 382 participants were included in clinical studies which showed the AR formulations significantly improved facial redness associated with winter xerosis (include improvements and stats). No irritation, sensitization, photo-irritation, photo-sensitization or product-related adverse reactions were observed or reported in the clinical studies.The new products significantly improved skin redness associated with winter xerosis in participants with self-perceived sensitive skin.

However, other oxime mechanisms (e.g. modulation of cholinergic or glutamatergic receptor) may be involved in the recovery. The main disadvantage of positively charged reactivators is their low ability to penetrate into the brain although crossing the blood brain  could be supported via increasing the dose of administered oxime. Thus, this study presents maximal tolerated doses (MTD) for marketed oximes (TMB-4, MMB-4, LüH-6, HI-6, 2-PAM) and the most promising K-oximes (K027, K048, K203) which can be used in OP therapy in the future. No signs of sarin intoxication were observed in mice treated with 100% MTD of HI-6 in contrast to those treated with atropine and only % LD of HI-6. 100% MTD of HI-6 resulted in levels of 500 μM and 12 μM in plasma and brain, respectively. This concentration is by a far margin safe with respect to direct effects on neuronal cell viability and, on the other hand, does not have any effects on central NMDA receptors or central nACh receptors. However, a weak antimuscarinic activity in case of LüH-6 and a weak peripheral antinicotinic action in case of TMB-4 and 2-PAM could be observed at their respective 100% MTD dose. These high doses, represented by MTD, are, however, irrelevant to clinical practice since they led to mild to moderate toxic side effects. Therefore, we conclude that clinically used doses of marketed oxime reactivators have no significant direct pharmacological effect on the tested receptors.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The consequences of obesity in the skin are underestimated. In this paper, we review the effect of obesity on the skin, including how increased body mass index affects skin , skin , collagen structure, and wound healing. Obesity also affects sebaceous and sweat glands and causes circulatory and lymphatic changes. Common skin manifestations related to obesity include acanthosis nigricans, acrochordons, keratosis pilaris, striae distensae, cellulite, and plantar hyperkeratosis. Obesity has metabolic effects, such as causing hyperandrogenism and gout, which in turn are associated with cutaneous manifestations. Furthermore, obesity is associated with an increased incidence of bacterial and Candida skin infections, as well as onychomycosis, inflammatory skin diseases, and chronic dermatoses like hidradenitis suppurativa, psoriasis, and rosacea. The association between atopic dermatitis and obesity and the increased risk of skin cancer among obese patients is debatable. Obesity is also related to rare skin conditions and to premature hair graying.

As the use of ALK inhibitors improves treatment outcomes over chemotherapy, the determent of central nervous system metastases has become an increasingly relevant therapeutic dilemma considering young age and possible extended overall survival. The goal of brain metastases management is to optimize both overall survival and quality of life, with the high priority of neurocognitive  preservation. Unfortunately in the first year on crizotinib, the pioneering ALK inhibitors, approximately one third of these patients fail in the central nervous system, which is explained by an inadequate central nervous system drug penetration through the blood-brain . Central nervous system-directed radiotherapy represents the most important strategy to control intracranial disease burden and extend the survival benefit with crizotinib. The role of whole brain irradiation in the treatment of brain metastases diminishes, as this technique is associated with the risk of neurocognitive decline. Stereotactic radiotherapy represents an alternative technique that delivers ablative doses of ionizing radiation to the limited volume of oligometastatic brain disease, offering sparing of the adjacent brain parenchyma and reduced neurotoxicity. The next generation ALK inhibitors were designed to cross the blood-brain  more efficiently than crizotinib and achieve higher concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid, offering prominent ability to control central nervous system spread. In the phase III ALEX trial the intracranial control was significantly better with alectinib as compared to crizotinib and it translated into survival benefit. Other next generation ALK inhibitors (i.e. ceritinib, brigatinib, lorlatinib) also demonstrated promising activity in the central nervous system.Copyright © 2019 Société française de radiothérapie oncologique (SFRO).

Current understanding of drug permeability at placental and blood-brain barriers during development is poor. In adults, ABC transporters limit many drugs from entering the brain; however, little is known about their  during development. : The transfer of clinically relevant doses of paracetamol (acetaminophen), digoxin and cimetidine into the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was estimated using radiolabelled drugs in Sprague Dawley rats at three developmental stages: E19, P4 and adult. Drugs were applied intraperitoneally either acutely or following chronic exposure (for five days). Entry into brain, CSF and transfer across the placenta was measured and compared to three markers (L-glucose, sucrose, glycerol) that cross barriers by "passive diffusion". The expression of ABC transporters in the brain, choroid plexus and placenta was estimated using RT-qPCR. : All three drugs entered the developing brain and CSF in higher amounts than the adult brain and CSF. Comparisons with "passive" permeability markers suggested that this might be due to age-related differences in the functional capacity of ABC-efflux mechanisms. In adult animals, chronic treatment reduced digoxin (12% to %, p<0.01) and paracetamol (30% to 21%, p<0.05) entry compared to acute treatment, with the decrease in digoxin entry correlating with up-regulation of efflux transporter  (PGP). In fetal and newborn animals, no gene up-regulation or transfer decreases were observed. Instead, chronic paracetamol treatment resulted in increased transfer into the fetal brain (66% to 104%, p<0.001). : These results suggest that the developing brain may be more at risk from acute drug exposure than the adult brain due to reduced efflux capacity and at greater risk from chronic treatment due to a lack of efflux mechanism regulatory capacity.Copyright: © 2019 Koehn L et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628933>Glutathione alleviates acute intracerebral hemorrhage injury via reversing mitochondrial dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Glutathione (GSH) has been studied for its neuroprotection value in several diseases, but the effect of GSH on intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is unclear.

Adult male C57BL/6j mice were randomized into Sham, ICH and GSH treatment groups. GSH was injected with the dose of 50, 100 or 200 mg / kg once per day for 3 days, starting immediately after operation.

GSH treatment also attenuated injury measured by decreased brain edema (p < 0.05, GSH 200 vs ICH. Sham, n= 10; ICH, n=10; GSH 200, n=12), blood-brain  disruption (p < 0.05, GSH 200 vs ICH.

In addition, GSH treatment also decreased cell apoptosis (p < 0.01, GSH 200 vs ICH. Sham, n= 6; ICH, n= 6; GSH 200, n=8) and resulted in up-regulated protein expression of complex I (p < 0.01, GSH 200 vs ICH. Sham, n= 6; ICH, n= 6; GSH 200, n=8), which was consistent with an overall up-regulation of complex I  in mitochondria using Oxygraph-2K high resolution respirometry (p < 0.05, GSH 200 vs ICH.

Although the precise components involved in maintaining this  have not been fully identified, heparan sulfate proteoglycans are believed to play an essential role in maintaining glomerular filtration. Although in situ studies have shown that a loss of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans increases the permeability of the glomerular filtration , recent studies using experimental models have shown that podocyte-specific deletion of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan assembly does not lead to proteinuria. However, tubular reabsorption of leaked proteins might have masked an increase in glomerular permeability in these models. Furthermore, not only podocytes but also glomerular endothelial cells are involved in heparan sulfate synthesis in the glomerular filtration . Therefore, we investigated the effect of a global heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan deficiency on glomerular permeability. We used a zebrafish embryo model carrying a homozygous germline mutation in the  gene. Glomerular permeability was assessed with a quantitative dextran tracer injection method. In this model, we accounted for tubular reabsorption. Loss of anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane was measured using polyethyleneimine staining.

Although the roles of desmosomes in normal  are well-established, their putative involvement in cancer remains unexplored. The KLK5 protease is thought of having fundamental roles in epidermal proteolysis and homeostasis, and its aberrant activity has been linked to skin pathologies. We found that deletion of Klk5 results in significantly higher numbers of lengthier desmosomes and enhanced skin strength. Klk5 mice retained normal skin   and are resistant to chemically-induced skin tumorigenesis. The resistance to tumorigenesis was not due to inhibition of inflammation, and on the contrary, absence of Klk5 increased the TPA-induced inflammatory skin response. We found that increased desmosomes and reduced proteolysis prevent oncogenic signaling by capturing β-catenin into the cytoplasm and facilitate epidermal keratinocyte apoptosis, thus, inhibiting tumor initiation. We highlight that the skin ultrastructure affects early neoplastic transformation by modulating intracellular signaling and suggest that tissue reinforcement provides a novel mode of tumor suppression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the exact effect of PI3K/PKB on injury associated with SAP has not yet been found.The present study was aimed at investigating the impact of wortmannin (WT), a PI3K/PKB inhibitor, on intestinal   in SAP rats.The rats were divided into 3 groups: 1) the Sham Surgery group (SS), whose duodenum and pancreas were flipped 3 times (n = 18); 2) the pancreatitis group (SAP), who were injected through retrograde pancreatic duct injection with % sodium taurocholate (n = 18); and 3) the WSAP intervention group (SAP+WT). Serum alpha-amylase levels, plasma endogenous endotoxin, hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, intestinal mucosa electron microscopy, intestinal permeability, and expression of p-PKB (phosphorylated protein kinase B) were measured.In our findings under an electron microscope, the SAP group presented cell edema and mitochondrial vacuolated degeneration, sparsely arranged microvilli, tight junction damage, and widening, while the WSAP group exhibited less change and lower pancreas scores (7.4 ±1.14, 10.2 ±1.48 and 12.0 ±1.58 for 3 h, 6 h and 12 h, respectively) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the plasma endogenous endotoxin levels and Evans blue content of the WSAP group was significantly lower at all timepoints than in the SAP group (p < 0.05). Western blotting showed that p-PKB expression was lower in the WSAP group than in the SAP group (p < 0.05). Our study suggests that WT relieves intestinal permeability changes in SAP rats and may be dose-dependent.The PI3K/PKB signal pathway may involve SAP-related intestinal injuries and WT may relieve SAP intestinal injuries through the PI3K/PKB pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649499>Auranofin Mediates Mitochondrial Dysregulation and Inflammatory Cell Death in Human Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells: Implications of Retinal Neurodegenerative Diseases.</a></h2><p>Photoreceptor degeneration occurs in various retinal diseases including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, molecular mechanisms are not fully understood yet. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) forms the outer blood retinal  (oBRB) and supplies glucose, oxygen and nutrients from the fenestrated choriocapillaris to photoreceptors for visual . Therefore, RPE dysfunction leads to photoreceptor injury/death and progression of blinding eye diseases. This study aims to understand the role of the thioredoxin (Trx) and its reductase (TrxR) redox signaling in human RPE dysfunction and cell death mechanism(s) in an  system.A human RPE cell line (APRE-19) was cultured in DMEM/F12 medium and treated with auranofin (AF - 4 μM, an inhibitor of TrxR) for 4 and 24 h. Mitochondrial and lysosomal , cellular oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activity were measured using cell assays, Western blotting, and confocal microscopy. Antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds were tested for blocking AF effects on RPE damage. Cell death mechanisms (LDH release to culture media) were determined using necroptosis, ferroptosis and pyroptosis inhibitors.  < 0.05 was considered significant in statistical analysis.Auranofin causes mitochondrial dysfunction (Δψm↓ and ATP↓), oxidative stress (HO↑) and mitophagic flux to lysosomes. Furthermore, the lysosomal enzyme (cathepsin L) activity is reduced while that of pro-inflammatory caspase-1 (NLRP3 inflammasome) is enhanced in ARPE-19. These effects of AF on ARPE-19 are inhibited by antioxidant N-acetylcysteine ( mM, NAC) and significantly by a combination of SS31 (mitochondrial antioxidant) and anti-inflammatory drugs (amlexanox and tranilast). AF also causes cell death as measured by cytosolic LDH release/leakage, which is not inhibited by either ferrostatin-1 or necrostatin-1 (ferroptosis and necroptosis inhibitors, respectively). Conversely, AF-induced LDH release is significantly reduced by MCC950 and Ac-YVAD-cmk (NLRP3 and Caspase-1 inhibitors, respectively), suggesting a pro-inflammatory cell death by pyroptosis.The Trx/TrxR redox system is critical for RPE  and viability. We previously showed that thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) is strongly induced in DR inhibiting the Trx/TrxR system and RPE dysfunction. Therefore, our results suggest that the TXNIP-Trx-TrxR redox pathway may participate in RPE dysfunction in DR and other retinal neurodegenerative diseases.Copyright © 2019 Yumnamcha, Devi and Singh.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31484296>Presbyopia and Other Eye Conditions in Teachers in Ghana.</a></h2><p>The aim of this paper is to assess the eye health needs of school teachers in the Asutifi districts of Ghana. Presenting distance visual acuity was measured in each eye. Those with visual acuity of <6/12 in one or both eyes had subjective refraction. All underwent basic eye examination and near functional vision was assessed for teachers aged ≥35 years using the Near Activity Visual Questionnaire (NVAQ). Teachers with uncorrected presbyopia were given a near correction and NVAQ was assessed again at two weeks. Three hundred teachers were examined with mean (SD) age of 36. (9.7) years, 54.3% were male and 6.3% (95% CI: 3.8 to 9.8%) had a presenting acuity of <6/12 in one or both eyes. The estimated prevalence of moderate visual impairment was 0.7% (95% CI: 0.08 to 2.4%). Lens opacities (50%) and refractive error (18%) were the main causes of visual loss. Seventy-five out of 136 (55.1%, 95% CI: 46.6 to 63.4%) of teachers aged ≥35 years were presbyopic, 45.3% (95% CI: 36.9 to 53.7%) of whom had presbyopic correction. Lack of awareness was the major  to presbyopic correction. Median Rasch score for teachers given presbyopic correction ( = 39) decreased by 60.6% from 46.0 (IQR: 10.7 to 72.8) to 18.1 (IQR: 0 to 58.9) and overall satisfaction with near vision improved at follow up. Prevalence of presbyopia was high, and spectacles improved satisfaction with near vision.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31416079>Low Geographic and Subspecific Variation in the Loud Call of the Widespread and Phenotypically Cryptic Northern Lesser Galago (Galago senegalensis) Suggests Taxonomic Uniformity.</a></h2><p>Like other nocturnal primates, many species of galago (Galagidae) are phenotypically cryptic, making their taxonomic status difficult to resolve. Recent taxonomic work has disentangled some of the confusion. This has resulted in an increase in the number of recognised galago species. The most widespread galago species, and indeed the most widespread nocturnal primate, is the northern lesser galago (Galago senegalensis) whose geographic range stretches >7,000 km across Africa. Based on morphology, 4 subspecies are currently recognised: G. s. senegalensis, G. s. braccatus, G. s. sotikae and G. s. dunni. We explore geographic and subspecific acoustic variation in G. senegalensis, testing three hypotheses: isolation by distance, genetic basis, and isolation by . There is statistical support for isolation by distance for 2 of 4 call parameters (fundamental frequency and unit length). Geographic distance explains a moderate amount of the acoustic variation. Discriminant  analysis provides some degree of separation of geographic regions and subspecies, but the percentage of misdesignation is high. Despite having (putative) parapatric geographic ranges, the most pronounced acoustic differences are between G. s. senegalensis and G. s. dunni. The findings suggest that the Eastern Rift Valley and Niger River are significant barriers for G. senegalensis. The acoustic structures of the loud calls of 121 individuals from 28 widespread sites are not significantly different. Although this makes it unlikely that additional unrecognised species occur within G. senegalensis at the sites sampled, vast areas of the geographic range remain unsampled. We show that wide-ranging species do not necessarily exhibit large amounts of variation in their vocal repertoire. This pattern may also be present in nocturnal primates with smaller geographic ranges.© 2019 S.

The BBS is composed of 1,2-dilauroyl--glycero-3-phosphocholine (DLPC) and 1,2-dimyristoyl--glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) with an embedded model membrane protein, a gramicidin A (gA) channel. The calculated free energy difference for the transfer of a gA channel from DLPC (hydrophobic thickness ≈ 21. Å) to DMPC (hydrophobic thickness ≈ 25. Å) bilayers, Δ(DLPC → DMPC), is -2.2 ± 0.7 kcal/mol. This value appears at odds with the traditional view that the hydrophobic length of the gA channel is ∼22 Å. To understand this discrepancy, we first note that recent MD simulations by different groups have shown that lipid bilayer thickness profiles in the vicinity of a gA channel differ qualitatively from the deformation profile predicted from continuum elastic bilayer models. Our MD simulations at low and high gA:lipid molar ratios and different membrane compositions indicate that the gA channel's effective hydrophobic length is ∼26 Å. Using this effective hydrophobic length, Δ(DLPC → DMPC) determined here is in excellent agreement with predictions based on continuum elastic models (-3.0 to -2.2 kcal/mol) where the bilayer deformation energy is approximated as a harmonic  of the mismatch between the channel's effective hydrophobic length and the hydrophobic thickness of the bilayer. The free energy profile for gA in the BBS includes a  at the interface between the two bilayers which can be attributed to the line tension at the interface between two bilayers with different hydrophobic thicknesses. This observation implies that translation of a peptide between two different regions of a cell membrane (such as between the liquid ordered and disordered phases) may include effects of a  at the interface in addition to the relative free energies of the species far from the interface. The BBS allows for direct transfer free energy calculations between bilayers without a need of a reference medium, such as bulk water, and thus provides an efficient simulation protocol for the quantitative characterization of protein-lipid interactions at all-atom resolution.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31329991>Effect of dietary graded resistant potato starch levels on growth performance, plasma cytokines concentration, and intestinal health in meat ducks.</a></h2><p>The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of dietary graded raw potato starch (RPS) levels on growth performance, plasma cytokines concentration, ileal  , and cecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentration in meat ducks from 1 to 35 D of age. This study included 2 experiments. In experiment (Exp.) 1, sixteen 35-day-old meat ducks were used to evaluate the AME of RPS by orogastric administration. Results showed the AME value of RPS on ducks is 2.76 kcal/g. In Exp. 2, a total of 600 one-day-old ducklings were randomly assigned to  isonitrogenous and isoenergetic dietary treatments that included 0 (control), 6, 12, 18, and 24% RPS, respectively. Samples were collected at both of 14 and 35 D. Neither growth performance nor ileal parameters (length, weight, and pH) at both of 14 and 35 D was affected by dietary RPS. However, the mucosal thickness (14 D), villus height (except for 18% RPS at 14 D), and the villus height: crypt depth ratio (14 and 35 D) of the ileum were increased in the 12 and 18% RPS diets when compared to 0% RPS diet. Meanwhile, proinflammatory factors such as plasma interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 (14 D) reduced in 12% RPS diet and tumor necrosis factor α decreased in 12% (except for 14 D) and 18% RPS groups. When compared with the control group, diets with 18% RPS significantly increased mucin 2 gene expression at 14 D, and 12% RPS elevated the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins including Zonula occludens-1 and Claudin 1 (except for 14 D) in the ileal mucosa of birds. Furthermore, ducks fed 12% RPS diet had higher concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate in cecal digesta than other groups. These findings indicated that diets with 12 and/or 18% RPS increased the cecal SCFA concentration, which subsequently enhanced the   and improved intestinal health in the ileum for 14 and 35-day-old meat ducks.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634869>The Effect of Lauric Acid on Pathogens Colonizing the Burn Wound: A Pilot Study.</a></h2><p>Some of the most serious complications of burns include septic infections. Instead of fulfilling the  of a protective , tissues damaged by high temperature create a niche that serves as an environment and source of nourishment for pathogens. An accepted practice is to use antibiotics to inhibit development of pathogens. Taking into consideration the characteristics of the burn wound and increasing antibiotic resistance, the search for new substances that have both antimicrobial and regenerative effects seems justified. The aim of the study was to determine the influence of lauric acid on bacteria-colonizing tissue samples taken during surgical treatment of burns.Lauric acid was combined with  different ointment bases: Anhydrous Eucerin DAB, Anhydrous Eucerin II, Hydrophilic Vaseline, White Vaseline, and Lekobaza. The content of lauric acid in the ointment bases was 10% to 20% w/w. The preparations were applied onto samples of burnt skin collected during surgery. The samples were subsequently subjected to a microbiological test with the use of model strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli.With one exception (White Vaseline), lauric acid showed a more pronounced effect on bacteria in 20% w/w concentration. In a 10% lauric acid concentration, no effect on bacteria was observed on the Hydrophilic Vaseline ointment base. Lauric acid had the strongest inhibiting effect on microbial growth of Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. Satisfactory zones of inhibition were also observed in the case of Escherichia coli. Growth inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed only when pure lauric acid was used.Due to its aseptic and regenerative effect on chemically damaged tissues, lauric acid can be a promising modifier of the burn healing process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567293>Th2 inflammatory responses in the development of nasal polyps and chronic rhinosinusitis.</a></h2><p>Pathogenesis of nasal polyp has been largely studied based on innate and adaptive immunity of sinonasal mucosa. So far, various factors have been identified that trigger an inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of nasal polyps. In this review, we summarized recently updated information in the understanding of mechanisms in the development of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp (CRSwNP) focusing on Th2 inflammation.Endotype of CRSwNP presented mainly Th2-skewed inflammation, and it has been associated with refractoriness and comorbidities. Staphylococcus aureus can drive Th2 inflammation by producing enterotoxins and serine protease-like protein. Moreover, S. aureus directly affected mucosal   and enhanced Th2 cytokine production by fast induction of epithelial-derived innate cytokines. Epithelial-derived innate cytokines, including TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33, promote Th2 responses via the development of innate lymphoid cells. Mast cell expresses IL-, IL-13, and periostin, and it plays a role in the pathogenesis of nasal polyps through orchestrating eosinophil infiltration. Formation of eosinophil extracellular traps and Charcot-Leyden crystals is strongly associated with disease severity and viscous mucus plug production. Therefore, it needs to be investigated mechanistically. The role of neutrophils in Th2 inflammation has been poorly understood but appears to enhance Th2 inflammation and make it more resistant to steroid therapy.There is growing evidence of the role of S. aureus in innate and acquired immunity, which contribute to Th2 inflammation in CRSwNP. Innate immunity, including epithelial-derived cytokines, plays a crucial role in the development of CRSwNP by inducing various pathways and need to be investigated more as Th2-targeted biomarkers. Recently, the role of neutrophilic inflammation in Th2 inflammation has started to be studied but still remains unclear.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576759>Sodium Tanshinone IIA Silate Alleviates High Glucose Induced  Impairment of Human Retinal Pigment Epithelium through the Reduction of NF-κB Activation via the AMPK/p300 Pathway.</a></h2><p> The disruption of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)  may perform a crucial role in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR). AMPK exerts several salutary effects on photoreceptors and the RPE  and improves retina abnormalities. The current study aimed to determine whether sodium tanshinone IIA silate (STS) has an inhibitory effect on ARPE-19 cell monolayer permeability under high glucose conditions, and establish the underlying mechanism.  We used a model of high glucose (25 mmol glucose, HG) condition mimicking diabetes in ARPE-19 cells, to assess the protective effects of STS. The   of RPE cells were measured by Transepithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran permeability. The interaction of NF-κB p65 and p300 were tested using immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assay. Protein levels were assayed using Western blot.  We found STS promoted the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) at T172 in RPE cells, and STS treatment thus inhibited ARPE-19 cell monolayer permeability under HG condition, similar to the permeability under normal glucose (. mmol glucose, NG). Moreover, we found that STS obviously prevented the colocalization of NF-κB and p300, and significantly inhibited their binding, subsequent decreased ARPE-19 cell monolayer permeability. Notably, Compound C (CC), a specific inhibitor of AMPK, blocked STS-mediated inhibition of ARPE-19 cell monolayer permeability.  STS inhibited HG-induced RPE permeability possibly through the reduction of NF-κB activation via the AMPK/p300 pathway. The protective effects of STS were attained through the suppression of p300-mediated NF-κB acetylation and STS might be utilized for treatment of DR, in terms of preventing inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31433211>Enteroids expressing a disease-associated mutant of EpCAM are a model for congenital tufting enteropathy.</a></h2><p>Congenital tufting enteropathy (CTE) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by severe intestinal failure in infancy and mutations in the epithelial cell adhesion molecule () gene. Previous studies of CTE in mice expressing mutant EpCAM show neonatal lethality. Hence, to study the cellular, molecular, and physiological alterations that result from EpCAM mutation, a tamoxifen-inducible mutant EpCAM enteroid model has been generated. The presence of mutant EpCAM in the model was confirmed at both mRNA and protein levels. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated the reduced expression of mutant EpCAM. Mutant enteroids had reduced budding potential as well as significantly decreased mRNA expression for epithelial lineage markers (), proliferation marker  and secretory pathway transcription factors (, . Significantly decreased numbers of Paneth and goblet cells were confirmed by staining. These findings were correlated with intestinal tissue from CTE patients and the mutant mice model that had significantly fewer Paneth and goblet cells than in healthy counterparts. FITC-dextran studies demonstrated significantly impaired   in monolayers derived from mutant enteroids compared with control monolayers. In conclusion, we have established an ex vivo CTE model. The role of EpCAM in the budding potential, differentiation, and   of enteroids is noted. Our study establishes new facets of EpCAM biology that will aid in understanding the pathophysiology of CTE and role of EpCAM in health and disease. Here, we develop a novel ex vivo enteroid model for congenital tufting enteropathy (CTE) based on epithelial cell adhesion molecule ( gene mutations found in patients. With this model we demonstrate the role of EpCAM in maintaining the functional homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium, including differentiation, proliferation, and  integrity.

The kinetics of QOOH radical decomposition and reaction with O have been determined as a  of temperature and pressure, using observations of OH radical production and decay following H-atom abstraction from tertiary-butyl hydroperoxide ((CH)COOH) by Cl atoms to produce QOOH (CH(CH)COOH) radicals. The kinetics of QOOH decomposition have been investigated as a  of temperature (251 to 298 K), and pressure (10 to 350 Torr), in helium and nitrogen bath gases, and those of the reaction between QOOH and O have been investigated as a  of temperature (251 to 304 K), and pressure (10 to 100 Torr) in He and N. Decomposition of the QOOH radicals was observed to display temperature and pressure dependence, with a  height for decomposition of (44.7 ± 4.0) kJ mol determined by master equation fitting to the experimental data. The rate coefficient for the reaction between QOOH and O was determined to be (.6 ± 1.7) × 10 cm s at 298 K, with no significant dependence on pressure, and can be described by the Arrhenius parameters  = (7.3 ± 6.8) × 10 cm s and  = -(.4 ± 2.1) kJ mol in the temperature range 251 to 304 K.

Here, we studied the impact of particular nutrients and supplements on gut functions related to the knockout of the epithelial caspase-8 gene. Caspase-8 knockout (Casp8) and control (Casp8) mice were fed for 4 wk a control diet (CD) enriched with 10% inulin (CD-Inu) or % sodium butyrate (CD-But) while having free access to plain water or water supplemented with 30% fructose (+F). Body weight changes, intestinal inflammation, and selected markers for   and of liver steatosis were assessed. Casp8 mice developed ileocolitis accompanied by changes in intestinal  morphology and reduced expression of -related genes such as mucin-2 ( and defensins in the ileum and  in the colon. Casp8 mice fed a CD also showed impaired body weight gain compared with Casp8 mice, which was even more pronounced in mice receiving water supplemented with fructose. Furthermore, we observed a marked liver steatosis and inflammation in some but not all Casp8 mice under a CD, which was on average similar to that observed in control mice under a fructose-rich diet. Hepatic lipid accumulation, as well as markers of ileal  , but not intestinal pathohistology or body weight loss, were attenuated by diets enriched with inulin or butyrate, especially in the absence of fructose supplementation. Our data show that ileocolitis,  dysfunction, and malassimilation in Caspase-8 knockout mice can be partially attenuated by oral inulin or butyrate supplementation. Genetic mouse models for ileocolitis are important to understand inflammatory bowel disease in humans. We examined dietetic factors that might aggravate or attenuate ileocolitis and related pathologies in such a model. Deletion of the caspase-8 gene results not only in ileocolitis but also in gut  dysfunction, liver steatosis, and malassimilation, which can be partially attenuated by oral inulin or sodium butyrate.

Despite huge efforts over several decades, the personal care industry still does not offer a perfect solution to satisfy the unmet needs of consumers for moisturising treatments in different ethnic groups. The paucity of data for the underlying cellular and biochemical problems in, and the effects of moisturisers on photodamaged facial skin may partly explain this. Mainly, single point measurements are used to understand the effects of products on skin  even on surrogate skin sites such as the non-photodamaged volar forearm. Some groups have developed discontinuous facial maps of skin biophysical properties, however, in 2014 a continuous facial analysis of bio-instrumental evaluations was developed using a heat map approach. These maps enabled a continuous visualization of features that not only revealed an unexpected complexity of facial skin but also indicated that use of surrogate skin sites for facial skin is inappropriate. We have demonstrated that remarkable gradients of skin hydration, TEWL, skin surface pH and sebum exist within short distances across the face and the gradients are distinctive among different ethnic groups. In addition, these studies have demonstrated that darkly-pigmented individuals do not necessarily have a better skin   than their less-pigmented counterparts and that Caucasians have a lower facial skin surface pH compared with more pigmented subjects. Overall, there are no correlations between capacitance, TEWL and skin surface pH including individual topology angle values. Novel 3D camera approaches have also been used to facilitate a more precise assignment of measurement sites and visualisation. The 3D facial colour mappings illustrated precisely the local moisturising effects of a moisturising cream. There were subtle ethnic differences in efficacy that may be related to underlying skin biochemistry and/or ethnic differences in product application. A placebo-controlled study using conductance measurements in Chinese subjects is also reported. Finally, a new whole face statistical approach has been taken to prove differences in skin parameters but also of moisturiser treatment that adds further to our understanding of the ethnic differences in skin  and product application.

The bonding mechanism is interpreted by analyzing the ground state multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) wave  of the reacting species and at all points along the PES. The interaction of CH with O on the singlet surface leads to a flat long-range attractive PEC lacking any maxima or minima along the curve. The triplet surface stems into a maximum along the curve resulting in a transition state with an energy  of .3 kcal/mol at CASSCF(4,4)/cc-pVTZ level. The resulting CHOO is less stable than the CHOO. In this study, the biradical character (β) is used as a measure to understand the difference in the topology of the singlet and triplet PECs and the relation of the biradical nature of the species with their structures. The CHOO has a larger biradical character than CHOO, and because of the larger bond order of CHOO, the C-O covalent bond becomes harder to break, thereby stabilizing CHOO. Thus, this study provides insights into the shape of the PEC obtained from the reaction between CH and O in terms of their bonding nature and from the shape of the curves, the temperature dependence or independence of the rate of the reaction is discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295716>Photodynamic therapy for skin cancer: How to enhance drug penetration?</a></h2><p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) induced by protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) has been widely used in dermatological practices such as treatment of skin cancers. Clearance rate depends on different factors such as light irradiation, skin oxygenation and drug penetration. The poor penetration of -aminolevulinic acid (-ALA) with topical application is limited and restrains the production of PpIX which could restrict PDT outcomes. This review will focus on techniques already used to enhance drug penetration in human skin, and will present their results, advantages, and drawbacks. Chemical and physical pretreatments will be discussed. Chemical pre-treatments comprise of drug formulation modification, use of agents that modify the heme cycle, enhance PpIX formation, and the combination of differentiation-promoting agent prior to PDT. On the other hand, physical pretreatments affect the skin  by creating holes in the skin or by removing stratum corneum. To promote drug penetration, iontophoresis and temperature modulation are interesting alternative methods. Cellular mechanisms enrolled during chemical or physical pretreatments have been investigated in order to understand how -ALA penetrates the skin, why it is preferentially metabolized in PpIX in tumour cells, and how it could be accumulated in deeper skin layers.

Anti-CD73 inhibitory antibodies are currently undergoing clinical testing for cancer immunotherapy. However, CD73 has many protective physiological functions that need to be taken into account for new targeted therapies. This review covers CD73 functions in multiple organ systems and cell types, with a particular focus on novel findings from the last  years. Missense loss-of- mutations in the CD73-encoding gene () cause the rare disease 'arterial calcifications due to deficiency of CD73' (ACDC). Aside from direct human disease involvement, cellular and animal model studies have revealed key functions of CD73 in tissue homeostasis and pathology across multiple organ systems. For example, in the context of the central nervous system (CNS), CD73 is anti-nociceptive and protects against inflammatory damage, while also contributing to age-dependent decline in cortical plasticity. CD73 preserves   in multiple tissues, but this is most evident in the respiratory system, where it inhibits endothelial permeability in an adenosine-dependent manner. CD73 has important cardioprotective functions during myocardial infarction and heart failure. Under ischemia/reperfusion injury conditions, rapid and sustained induction of CD73 confers protection in the liver and kidney. In some cases, the mechanism by which CD73 mediates tissue injury are less clear. For example, CD73 has a promoting role in liver fibrosis, but protects in the case of lung fibrosis. Future studies that integrate CD73 regulation and  at the cellular level with physiological responses will improve its utility as a disease target.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566374>Ab Initio/Transition-State Theory Study of the Reactions of ĊH Species of Relevance to 1,3-Pentadiene, Part I: Potential Energy Surfaces, Thermochemistry, and High-Pressure Limiting Rate Constants.</a></h2><p>In this study, the reactions of ĊH radicals are theoretically investigated, with a particular emphasis on hydrogen atom addition reactions to 1,3-pentadiene (CH) to form ĊH radicals, although the subsequent isomerization and decomposition reactions of the ĊH radicals are also of direct relevance to the radicals formed from the pyrolysis and oxidation of species including pentene and cyclopentane. Moreover, H-atom abstraction reactions by hydrogen atoms from 1,3-pentadiene are also investigated. The geometries and frequencies of 63 potential energy surface (PES) minima and 88 transition states are optimized at the ωB97XD/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. Spin-unrestricted open-shell single-point energies for all the species are calculated at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory with basis set corrections from MP2/aug-cc-pVXZ (where X = T and Q). A one-dimensional hindered rotor treatment is employed for torsional modes, with the M06-2X/6-311++G(D,P) method used to compute the potential energy as a  of the dihedral angle. The high-pressure limiting rate constants and the thermochemical properties for C species are calculated using the Master Equation System Solver (MESS) with conventional transition-state theory and comparisons made with existing available literature data. A hydrogen atom can add to the terminal carbon atom of 1,3-pentadiene to form the 2,4-ĊH radical and/or the internal carbon atoms to form 2,-ĊH, 1,4-ĊH, and 1,3-ĊH radicals. Among the four entrance channels for Ḣ atom addition reactions, the formation of 2,4-ĊH and 1,3-ĊH radicals is more exothermic in comparison to the other ĊH isomers (2,-ĊH, 1,4-ĊH) because of the resonantly stabilized allylic structure. Consequently, the formation of the former is generally dominant in terms of  heights. Ḣ atom addition reactions to 1,3-pentadiene are compared to available C-C alkenes and dienes, with external addition calculated to be kinetically favored over internal addition. However, the correlation between heats of formation and energy barriers for Ḣ atom addition to 1,2-dienes is different from that for 1,3- and 1,4-dienes. Hydrogen atom addition and abstraction rate constants are also compared for 1,3-pentadiene, with addition found to be dominant. The subsequent unimolecular reactions on the ĊH PES are found to be highly complex with reactions taking place on a multiple-well multiple-channel PES. For clarity, the reaction mechanism and kinetics of each ĊH radical are discussed individually in terms of the computed enthalpy of the reaction and activation, the transition-state structure/reaction class, and also in terms of the combustion species for which the reactions are of potential importance. The reactions on the ĊH PES are divided into three reaction classes (H-shift isomerization, cycloaddition, and β-scission reactions), and the reactivity-structure-based estimation rules for energy barriers are derived for these three reaction classes and compared to literature results for alkyl radicals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31417573>Liver X Receptor Alpha Is Important in Maintaining Blood-Brain  .</a></h2><p>Dysfunction of the blood-brain  (BBB) contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of several neuroinflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). Potential players that regulate BBB  are the liver X receptors (LXRs), which are ligand activated transcription factors comprising two isoforms, LXRα, and LXRβ. However, the role of LXRα and LXRβ in regulating BBB (dys) during neuroinflammation remains unclear, as well as their individual involvement. Therefore, the goal of the present study is to unravel whether LXR isoforms have different roles in regulating BBB  under neuroinflammatory conditions. We demonstrate that LXRα, and not LXRβ, is essential to maintain  integrity . Specific knockout of LXRα in brain endothelial cells resulted in a more permeable  with reduced expression of tight junctions. Additionally, the observed dysfunction was accompanied by increased endothelial inflammation, as detected by enhanced expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1) and increased transendothelial migration of monocytes toward inflammatory stimuli. To unravel the importance of LXRα in BBB  , we made use of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) MS mouse model. Induction of EAE in a constitutive LXRα knockout mouse and in an endothelial specific LXRα knockout mouse resulted in a more severe disease score in these animals. This was accompanied by higher numbers of infiltrating leukocytes, increased endothelial VCAM-1 expression, and decreased expression of the tight junction molecule claudin-. Together, this study reveals that LXRα is indispensable for maintaining BBB integrity and its immune quiescence. Targeting the LXRα isoform may help in the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent BBB dysfunction, and thereby neuroinflammatory disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31420526>In Vivo Evaluation of Isoprenoid Triazole Bisphosphonate Inhibitors of Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Synthase: Impact of Olefin Stereochemistry on Toxicity and Biodistribution.</a></h2><p>The enzyme geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGDPS) synthesizes the 20-carbon isoprenoid geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, which is used in geranylgeranylation reactions. We have demonstrated that GGDPS inhibitors in multiple myeloma (MM) cells disrupt Rab geranylgeranylation, leading to inhibition of monoclonal protein trafficking, induction of the unfolded protein response pathway (UPR), and apoptosis. We have previously reported preclinical studies with the GGDPS inhibitor VSW1198, which is a mixture of homogeranyl/homoneryl triazole bisphosphonates. Additional structure- efforts have led to development of the -methylated derivatives RAM2093 (homogeranyl) and RAM2061 (homoneryl). As little is known regarding the impact of olefin stereochemistry on drug properties in vivo, we pursued additional preclinical evaluation of RAM2093 and RAM2061. In MM cell lines, both isomers induce activation of UPR/apoptotic markers in a concentration-dependent manner and with similar potency. Single-dose testing in CD-1 mice identified a maximum tolerated i.v. dose of 0. mg/kg for RAM2061 and 0.3 mg/kg for RAM2093. Liver toxicity was the primary  to dose escalation for both compounds. Disruption of geranylgeranylation in vivo was confirmed after multidose administration of either compound. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed plasma terminal half-lives of 29.2 ± 6 (RAM2061) and 22.1 ± 4 hours (RAM2093). Relative to RAM2061, RAM2093 levels were significantly higher in liver tissue but not in other tissues. Using MM.1S flank xenografts, we observed a significant reduction in tumor growth in mice treated with RAM2061 relative to controls. Collectively, these studies reveal olefin stereochemistry-dependent effects on GGDPS inhibitor biodistribution and confirm the in vivo efficacy of this novel therapeutic approach. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: These studies reveal olefin stereochemistry-dependent effects on the in vivo properties of two novel triazole bisphosphonate inhibitors of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of this class of inhibitors for the treatment of multiple myeloma.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562503>Dietary Spray-Dried Porcine Plasma Prevents Cognitive Decline in Senescent Mice and Reduces Neuroinflammation and Oxidative Stress.</a></h2><p>Aging is characterized by chronic, low-grade inflammation that correlates with cognitive decline. Dietary supplementation with spray-dried porcine plasma (SDP) reduces immune activation in rodent models of inflammation and aging.We investigated whether the anti-inflammatory properties of SDP could ameliorate age-related cognitive deterioration and preserve brain homeostasis in an aging mouse model of senescence.Male senescence-accelerated prone 8 (SAMP8) mice were used. In Experiment 1, cognitive performance (n = 10-14 mice/group) was analyzed by the novel object recognition test in 2-mo-old mice (2M group) and in mice fed a control diet or a diet supplemented with 8% SDP for 2 (4M-CTL, 4M-SDP groups) and 4 mo (6M-CTL, 6M-SDP groups). In Experiment 2, the permeability of the blood-brain  and junctional proteins in brain tissue was assessed, as well as synaptic density, oxidative stress markers, and inflammatory genes and proteins in mice from the 2M, 6M-CTL, and 6M-SDP groups (n = -11). Statistical analyses included one-factor ANOVA followed by Fisher's posthoc test.6M-SDP mice had better cognitive performance than 6M-CTL mice, in both short-term (P = 0.024) and long-term (P = 0.017) memory tests. In brain tissue, 6M-SDP mice showed reduced brain capillary permeability (P = 0.034) and increased ZO1 and E-cadherin expression (both P <0.04) compared with 6M-CTL mice. SDP also prevented the NFκB activation observed in 6M-CTL mice (P = 0.002) and reduced Il6 expression and hydrogen peroxide concentration (both P <0.03) observed in 6M-CTL mice. SDP also increased the concentration of IL10 (P = 0.027), an anti-inflammatory cytokine correlated with memory preservation.In senescent SAMP8 mice, dietary supplementation with SDP attenuated cognitive decline and prevented changes in brain markers of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644554>Acute normobaric hypoxia does not affect the simultaneous exercise-induced increase in circulating BDNF and GDNF in young healthy men: A feasibility study.</a></h2><p>Physical exercise has a neuromodulatory effect on the central nervous system (CNS) partially by modifying expression of neuropeptides produced and secreted by neurons and glial cells, among which the best examined are brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Because both neurotrophins can cross the brain-blood  (BBB), their blood levels indirectly reflect their production in the CNS. Moreover, both neuropeptides are involved in modulation of dopaminergic and serotoninergic system . Because limited information is available on the effects of exercise to volition exhaustion and acute hypoxia on CNS, BDNF and GDNF formation, the aims of the present study were to verify whether 1) acute exercise to exhaustion in addition to neurons also activates glial cells and 2) additional exposure to acute normobaric moderate hypoxia affects their . In this feasibility study we measured blood concentrations of BDNF, GDNF, and neuropeptides considered as biomarkers of brain damage (bFGF, NGF, S100B, GFAP) in seven sedentary healthy young men who performed a graded exercise test to volitional exhaustion on a cycle ergometer under normoxic (N) and hypoxic conditions: 2,000 m (H2; FiO2 = 16.6%) and 3,000 m altitude (H3; FiO2 = 14.7%). In all conditions serum concentrations of both BDNF and GDNF increased immediately after cessation of exercise (p<0.01). There was no effect of condition or interaction (condition x time of measurement) and exercise on any of the brain damage biomarkers: bFGF, NGF, S100B, GFAP. Moreover, in N (0<0.01) and H3 (p<0.05) exercise caused elevated serum -HT concentration. The results suggest that a graded effort to volitional exhaustion in normoxia, as well as hypoxia, simultaneously activates both neurons and astrocytes. Considering that s100B, GFAP, bFGF, and NGF (produced mainly by astrocytes) are markers of brain damage, it can be assumed that a maximum effort in both conditions is safe for the CNS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31542404>Enhancement of epithelial cell autophagy induced by sinensetin alleviates epithelial  dysfunction in colitis.</a></h2><p>Intestinal epithelial  dysfunction is a key pathology of colitis. Autophagy of epithelial cells maintains homeostasis of the intestinal  by inhibiting apoptosis and stimulating degradation of the tight junction protein claudin-2. This study investigated the effects and mechanism of activity of sinensetin, a polymethylated flavonoid isolated from tangerine peel and citrus, on intestinal  dysfunction in colitis. Animal model of colitis were established by intracolonic administration of 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid and oral treatment with dextran sulfate sodium. Epithelial   was evaluated by measuring the serum recovery of ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate-4 kD dextran in vivo and transepithelial electrical resistance in Caco-2 cells, respectively. Epithelial cell autophagy assayed by autophagosome formation and expression of autophagy-related protein. Sinensetin reversed colitis-associated increase in intestinal permeability, significantly promoted epithelial cell autophagy, and further decreased epithelial cell apoptosis, and reduced mucosal claudin-2. Sinenstetin alleviated colitis symptoms rats and mice with colitis. Knockdown of ' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) reversed the promotion of epithelial autophagy by sinensetin. In conclusion, sinensetin significantly alleviated intestinal  dysfunction in colitis by promoting epithelial cell autophagy, and further inhibiting apoptosis and promoting claudin-2 degradation. The results highlighted novel potential benefits of sinensetin in colitis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A comfortable, semi-occlusive, artificial skin  that is well tolerated, provides protection, and reduces water loss, is desired.To evaluate, in adults with AD, the potential tolerability and therapeutic benefits of a crosslinked polymer skin  film (XPL).A single center, open-label pilot study was conducted involving ten subjects with moderate to severe AD. Subjects applied XPL up to twice daily for 30 days on a selected treatment area. Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA), clinical signs of eczema, and pruritus were assessed on days 1, 3, , 15, and 30. Film durability and subject satisfaction were also evaluated.IGA scores improved from moderate to severe at baseline to clear to almost clear in 8/9 subjects at day 30. Pruritus improved from trace-to-severe itching (baseline) to all subjects having trace-to-no itching at day 30. There was one adverse event of mild exudative dermatitis.The study was limited by small sample size, open-label design, and lack of control.XPL may be an effective adjuvant in AD treatment.

The CP epithelium regulates the transport of ions and water between the blood and the ventricles, contributing to CSF production and composition. Several studies suggest a connection between the cation channel transient receptor potential vanilloid-4 (TRPV4) and transepithelial ion movement. TRPV4 is a nonselective, calcium-permeable cation channel present in CP epithelia reported to be activated by cytokines and inflammatory mediators. Utilizing the PCP-R (porcine choroid plexus-Riems) cell line, we investigated the effects of various cytokines and inflammatory mediators on TRPV4-mediated activity. Select proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, TGF-β1) had inhibitory effects on TRPV4-stimulated transepithelial ion flux and permeability changes, whereas anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-4, and IL-6) had none. Quantitative mRNA analysis showed that these cytokines had no effect on TRPV4 transcription levels. Inhibition of the transcription factor NF-κB, involved in the production and regulation of several inflammatory cytokines, inhibited TRPV4-mediated activity, suggesting a link between TRPV4 and cytokine production. Contrary to published studies, the proinflammatory mediator arachidonic acid (AA) had inhibitory rather than stimulatory effects on TRPV4-mediated responses. However, inhibition of AA metabolism also caused inhibitory effects on TRPV4, suggesting a complex interaction of AA and its metabolites in the regulation of TRPV4 activity. Together these data imply that TRPV4 activity is involved in the inflammatory response; it is negatively affected by proinflammatory mediators. Furthermore, arachidonic acid metabolites, but not arachidonic acid itself, are positive regulators of TRPV4.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31524756>Clinical Pearls on Sleep Management in Atopic Dermatitis.</a></h2><p>Multiple etiologies contribute to sleep disturbance in atopic dermatitis (AD) patients, including learned scratching behavior and increased monoamines, cutaneous blood flow, inflammatory cell activities, and cytokines, as well as decreased melatonin, anti-inflammatory cytokines, and skin  . Insomnia impairs cognitive development in children with AD, leading to behavioral problems and learning disabilities. Insomnia in adults with AD impedes work productivity. In this article, we discuss pearls on improving insomnia through both nonpharmacologic modalities, such as environmental adjustments and massage therapy, and pharmaceutical approaches including melatonin, antihistamines, tricyclic antidepressants, mirtazapine, and benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine sedatives.

Endothelial cell β integrin receptors play a direct role in blood-brain  (BBB) dysfunction through regulation of tight junction proteins and infiltrating leukocytes, potentially mediated by β1 integrins. Following tandem transient common carotid artery/middle cerebral artery occlusion on wild-type mice, we administered the integrin a5b1 inhibitor, ATN-161, intraperitoneal (IP) injection at 1 mg/kg acutely after reperfusion, on post-stroke day (PSD)1 and PSD2. Systemic changes (heart rate, pulse distension, and body temperature) were determined. Additionally, infarct volume and edema were determined by 2,3-triphenyltetrazolium chloride and magnetic resonance imaging, while neurological changes were evaluated using an 11-point Neuroscore. Brain immunohistochemistry was performed for claudin-, αβ1, IgG, and CD45 + cells, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed for matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), interleukin (IL)-1β, collagen IV, and CXCL12. ATN-161 significantly reduced integrin αβ1 expression in the surrounding peri-infarct region with no systemic changes. Infarct volume, edema, and functional deficit were significantly reduced in ATN-161-treated mice. Furthermore, ATN-161 treatment reduced IgG extravasation into the parenchyma through conserved claudin-, collagen IV, CXCL12 while reducing MMP-9 transcription. Additionally, IL-1β and CD45 + cells were reduced in the ipsilateral cortex following ATN-161 administration. Collectively, ATN-161 may be a promising novel stroke therapy by reducing post-stroke inflammation and BBB permeability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31488709>Subgenomic flavivirus RNA binds the mosquito DEAD/H-box helicase ME31B and determines Zika virus transmission by .</a></h2><p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne flavivirus predominantly transmitted by  mosquitoes and poses a global human health threat. All flaviviruses, including those that exclusively replicate in mosquitoes, produce a highly abundant, noncoding subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) in infected cells, which implies an important  of sfRNA during mosquito infection. Currently, the role of sfRNA in flavivirus transmission by mosquitoes is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that an sfRNA-deficient ZIKV (ZIKVΔSF1) replicates similar to wild-type ZIKV in mosquito cell culture but is severely attenuated in transmission by  after an infectious blood meal, with % saliva-positive mosquitoes for ZIKVΔSF1 vs. 31% for ZIKV. Furthermore, viral titers in the mosquito saliva were lower for ZIKVΔSF1 as compared to ZIKV. Comparison of mosquito infection via infectious blood meals and intrathoracic injections showed that sfRNA is important for ZIKV to overcome the mosquito midgut  and to promote virus accumulation in the saliva. Next-generation sequencing of infected mosquitoes showed that viral small-interfering RNAs were elevated upon ZIKVΔSF1 as compared to ZIKV infection. RNA-affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry analysis uncovered that sfRNA specifically interacts with a specific set of  proteins that are normally associated with RNA turnover and protein translation. The DEAD/H-box helicase ME31B showed the highest affinity for sfRNA and displayed antiviral activity against ZIKV in  cells. Based on these results, we present a mechanistic model in which sfRNA sequesters ME31B to promote flavivirus replication and virion production to facilitate transmission by mosquitoes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31429688>Functional changes of Paneth cells in the intestinal epithelium of mice with obstructive jaundice and after internal and external biliary drainage.</a></h2><p>To investigate the functional changes of Paneth cells in the intestinal epithelium of mice with obstructive jaundice (OJ) and after internal and external biliary drainage.The experiment was divided into two stages. First stage: a total of 100 male C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to two groups: (I) sham operation (SH); (II) obstructive jaundice (OJ). The mice were respectively sacrificed before operation and on the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th days after operation to collect blood, terminal ileum, liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes specimens. Second stage: a total of 40 male C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to four groups: (I) SH; (II) OJ; (III) OJ and external biliary drainage (ED); and (IV) OJ and internal biliary drainage (ID). The animals underwent surgical ligation of the bile duct on day 0. They were reoperated on day  for biliary drainage procedure. Blood and terminal ileum specimens were collected on day 10. Various indicators were detected by Real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, Western blot and other methods.The number of Paneth cells and expression of lysozyme and cryptdin 4 were increased first and then decreased over time in OJ group, and the difference was statistically significant（p<0.05）. however, no obvious difference was found in different time points of the SH group (P>0.05). The grade of mucosal injury, the level of plasma DAO and the rate of bacterial translocation increased gradually in the OJ group with the extension of time (p<0.05). In addition，there were negative correlations between the level of plasma DAO and expression of lysozyme (r= -0.729，p<0.05) and cryptdin-4 (r= -0.718，p<0.05) in OJ group. After the secondary operation in mice to relieve OJ, the number of Paneth cells and expression of lysozyme and cryptdin 4 were increased in ID group and ED group than that in OJ group, and more significant in ID group than that in ED group, with statistical differences（p<0.05）. In addition, the rate of bacterial translocation and plasma DAO were lower in ID group and ED group than those in OJ group, which were more obvious in ID group than that in ED group, and the differences were statistically significant（p<0.05）.OJ could cause intestinal Paneth cells dysfunction in mice, which was mainly manifested in the decrease of Paneth cells number, as well as the decrease of cryptdin-4 and lysozyme expression levels. The change of Paneth cells in OJ was strongly correlated with intestinal mucosal  dysfunction and bacterial translocation. ID was more significant than ED in restoring the  of Paneth cells, thereby exerting a role in the functional recovery of the intestinal mucosal .

Female Wistar rats weighing 140-160 g were divided into groups. The control, EEL, HF, and EEL+HF groups received water (vehicle, p.o.), 1.0 μg ethinylestradiol plus .0 μg levonorgestrel (p.o.), fructose (10% ), and EEL plus HF, respectively, on a daily basis for 8 weeks. Results revealed that treatment with EEL or HF led to insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, increased hepatic uric acid production and triglyceride content, reduced glycogen content, and reduced production of plasma or hepatic glutathione- and G6PD-dependent antioxidants. HF but not EEL also increased fasting glucose and hepatic PDK-4. Nonetheless, these alterations were attenuated by EEL in HF-treated rats. Our results demonstrate that hepatic lipid accumulation and glycogen depletion induced by HF is accompanied by increased PDK-4 and defective G6PD activity. The findings also suggest that EEL would attenuate hepatic lipid accumulation and glycogen depletion by suppression of PDK-4 and enhancement of a G6PD-dependent antioxidant .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31486527>Peptidase neurolysin functions to preserve the brain after ischemic stroke in male mice.</a></h2><p>Previous studies documented up-regulation of peptidase neurolysin (Nln) after brain ischemia, however, the significance of Nln  in the post-stroke brain remained unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the functional role of Nln in the brain after ischemic stroke. Administration of a specific Nln inhibitor Agaricoglyceride A (AgaA) to mice after stroke in a middle cerebral artery occlusion model, dose-dependently aggravated injury measured by increased infarct and edema volumes, blood-brain  disruption, increased levels of interleukin 6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, neurological and motor deficit 24 h after stroke. In this setting, AgaA resulted in inhibition of Nln in the ischemic hemisphere leading to increased levels of Nln substrates bradykinin, neurotensin, and substance P. AgaA lacked effects on several physiological parameters and appeared non-toxic to mice. In a reverse approach, we developed an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV2/-CAG-Nln) to overexpress Nln in the mouse brain. Applicability of AAV2/-CAG-Nln to transduce catalytically active Nln was confirmed in primary neurons and in vivo. Over-expression of Nln in the mouse brain was also accompanied by decreased levels of its substrates. Two weeks after in vivo transduction of Nln using the AAV vector, mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion and the same outcome measures were evaluated 72 h later. These experiments revealed that abundance of Nln in the brain protects animals from stroke. This study is the first to document functional significance of Nln in pathophysiology of stroke and provide evidence that Nln is an endogenous mechanism functioning to preserve the brain from ischemic injury.

Theoretical investigations also predicated the high performance can be well preserved at sub-10 nm nodes in the ballistic limit. However, both experimental experience and theoretical calculations pointed out achieving high-quality ohmic has become the main limiting factor for high-performance 2D FET. In this work, we proposed a new sandwiched ohmic contact with indium for InSe FET and comprehensively evaluated its performance from views of material and device based on ab initio methods. The material properties denote that all of fundamental issues of ohmic contact including tunneling , the Schottky , and effective doping are well concerned by introducing the sandwiched structure, and excellent contact resistance was achieved. At device performance level, devices with gate length of 7, , and 3 nm were investigated. All metrics of sandwiched contacted devices far exceed requirement of the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) and exhibit obvious promotion as compared to conventional structures. Maximum boost of current with 69.4%, 50%, and 49% are achieved for devices with 7, , and 3 nm gate length, respectively. Meanwhile, maximum reduction of the intrinsic delay with 20.4%, 16.7%, and 18.9% are attained. Moreover, a benchmark of energy-delay product (EDP) against other 2D FETs is presented. All InSe FETs with sandwiched ohmic contact surpass MoS FETs as well as requirement from ITRS 2024.

The experiment was conducted using a completely randomized design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement consisting of 2 different SD and 2 supplemental levels of dietary Trp. A total of 1,140 Ross 308 broiler chickens at 21 d of age were allotted to 1 of 4 treatments with  replicates. Low SD (9 birds/m2) and high SD (18 birds/m2) were achieved by raising different number of birds per identical floor pen (2.0 m × 2.4 m). The basal diet was formulated with no supplemental Trp in diets to meet or exceed nutrient recommendation of the Ross 308 manual. The calculated concentrations of total Trp and digestible Trp in the basal diet were 0.19 and 0.16%, respectively. The other diet was prepared by adding 0.16% crystalline Trp to the basal diet. Diets were fed to birds for 21 d. At the end of the experiment, 2 birds per replicate were euthanized to collect tissue samples for further analyses. Results indicated that there were no interactions between SD and dietary Trp for all measurements. For the main effects, birds raised at a low SD had greater (P < 0.01) body weight gain, feed intake, and feed efficiency than those raised at a high SD. However, supplementation of dietary Trp had no effect on broiler performance. Furthermore, there were no main effects of SD and dietary Trp on intestinal  functions. In conclusion, broiler chickens raised in a floor pen with a high SD (18 birds/m2) have decreased growth performance with little changes in intestinal  functions. Supplementation of dietary Trp at 0.16% has no positive effect on broiler chickens raised in a floor pen with either a low or high SD.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540548>Pyrimidine Analogues as a New Class of Gram-Positive Antibiotics, Mainly Targeting Thymineless-Death Related Proteins.</a></h2><p>Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria are widespread throughout the world and pose an increasingly serious threat to human and animal health. Besides implementing strict measures to prevent improper antibiotic use, it remains essential that novel antibiotics must be developed. These antibiotics need to exert their activity via mechanisms different from those employed by currently approved antibiotics. In this study, we used several -fluorouracil (-FU) analogues as chemical probes and investigated the potential of these pyrimidine analogues as antibacterial agents. Several -FU derivatives exerted potent activity against strains of Gram-positive cocci (GPC) that are susceptible or resistant toward approved antibiotics, without showing cross-resistance. Furthermore, we have provided evidence that the pyrimidine analogues exerted anti-GPC activity via thymineless death by inhibition of thymidylate synthetase (ThyA) and/or inhibition of RNA synthesis. Interestingly, whole genome resequencing of in vitro-selected, pyrimidine analogue-resistant  mutants indicated that  strains with pyrimidine-analogue resistance induced an amino acid (AA) substitution, deletion, and/or insertion into thymineless-death related proteins except for ThyA, or enhanced the ThyA transcription level. Thus,  may avoid altering the ThyA  by introducing an AA substitution, suggesting that the pyrimidine analogues, which directly bind to ThyA without phosphorylation, may be more effective and show a higher genetic  than the pyrimidines that depend on phosphorylation for activity. The findings of this study may assist in the future development of a novel class of antibiotics for combating MDR GPC, including methicillin-resistant  and vancomycin-resistant .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31473343>Dendrobium officinale polysaccharides alleviate colon tumorigenesis via restoring intestinal   and enhancing anti-tumor immune response.</a></h2><p>Intact epithelial  and mucosal immune system are crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Previous study indicated that Dendrobium officinale polysaccharides (DOPS) can regulate immune responses and inflammation to alleviate experimental colitis. However, it remains largely unknown whether DOPS can suppress AOM/DSS-induced colorectal cancer (CRC) model through its direct impact on intestinal   and intestinal mucosal immunity. Here, we demonstrated the therapeutic action of DOPS for CRC model and further illustrated its underlying mechanisms. Treatment with -aminosalicylic acid (-ASA) and DOPS significantly improved the clinical signs and symptoms of chronic colitis, relieve colon damage, suppress the formation and growth of colon tumor in CRC mice. Moreover, administration of DOPS effectively preserved the intestinal   via reducing the loss of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin in adjacent tissues and carcinomatous tissues. Further studies demonstrated that DOPS improved the metabolic ability of tumor infiltrated CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and reduced the expression of PD-1 on CTLs to enhance the anti-tumor immune response in the tumor microenvironments (TME). Together, the conclusions indicated that DOPS restore intestinal   and enhance intestinal anti-tumor immune response to suppress CRC, which may be a novel strategy for the prevention and treatment of CRC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

At present, a number of studies that have employed animal, human and cell cultures support the potential neuroprotective effects of green tea catechins against neurological disorders. However, the concentration of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) in systemic circulation is very low and EGCG disappears within several hours. EGCG undergoes microbial degradation in the small intestine and later in the large intestine, resulting in the formation of various microbial ring-fission metabolites which are detectable in the plasma and urine as free and conjugated forms. Recently, in vitro experiments suggested that EGCG and its metabolites could reach the brain parenchyma through the blood-brain  and induce neuritogenesis. These results suggest that metabolites of EGCG may play an important role, alongside the beneficial activities of EGCG, in reducing neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss the  of EGCG and its microbial ring-fission metabolites in the brain in suppressing brain dysfunction. Other possible actions of EGCG metabolites will also be discussed.</p></html>
