The research was carried out in selected lakes located within the administrative boundaries of the city of Olsztyn, the largest city in the Masurian Lake District (NE Poland). The experiment was conducted in three summer seasons near bathing sites in three lakes, which are the most popular as recreational sites (Lake Kortowskie, Lake Tyrsko, and Lake Skanda). Microfungi isolated from the phyllosphere of 13 plant species of the littoral zone from dropped leaves of coast plants with no disease symptoms were used as the study material. The isolated fungi were identified in accordance with the accepted diagnostic procedures applied in mycological laboratories. A total of 36 yeast species of 16 genera were identified. Fungi found earlier at the bathing sites of the lakes were identified in 60% of the cases. Nine species were categorised as class BSL-2 fungi.

Cutaneous burn-injury promotes alteration of cutaneous and systemic immune response that can affect both commensal and pathogenic microbes. A cross-sectional study of a limited number of burn patients revealed a difference in the bacteriome of burned versus control participants. Temporal changes of the skin  during health and cutaneous burn-injury remains largely unknown. Furthermore, how this microbial shift relates to community function in the collective metagenome remain elusive. Due to cost considerations and reduced healing time, rodents are frequently used in burn research, despite inherent physiological differences between rodents and human skin. Using a rat burn model, a longitudinal study was conducted to characterize the rat skin bacterial residents and associated community functions in states of health (n = 30) (sham-burned) and when compromised by burn-injury (n = 24). To address the knowledge gap, traumatic thermal injury and disruption of cutaneous surface is associated with genus-level changes in the , reduced bacterial richness, and altered representation of bacterial genes and associated predicted functions across different skin microbial communities. These findings demonstrate that, upon burn-injury, there is a shift in diversity of the skin's organismal assemblages, yielding a core  that is distinct at the genome and functional level. Moreover, deviations from the core community correlate with temporal changes post-injury and community transition from the state of cutaneous health to disease (burn-injury).© The Author(s) 2019.

Infections are often linked to the consumption and handling of poultry meat. The aim of the present study was to investigate the caecal  of birds infected with  at different ages. Therefore, a total of 180 birds of the laying hybrid Lohmann Brown-Classic were housed in 12 subgroups of 15 animals each in three performed repetitions. Three birds per subgroup were experimentally infected with  at an age of about 21 days and about 78 days (4.46 ± 0.35 log CFU/bird). Twenty-one days after experimental infection,  studies were performed on 72 caecal samples of dissected birds (three primary infected and three further birds/subgroup). Amplification within the hypervariable region V 4 of the 16S rRNA gene was performed and sequenced with the Illumina MiSeq platform. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS Enterprise Guide (version 7.1) and R (version 3.5.2). Both factors, the experimental replication ( < 0.001) and the chickens' age at infection ( < 0.001) contributed significantly to the differences in microbial composition of the caecal samples. The factor experimental replication explained 24% of the sample's variability, whereas the factor age at infection explained 14% thereof. Twelve of 32 families showed a significantly different count profile between the two age groups, whereby strongest differences were seen for seven families, among them the family  (adjusted  = 0.003). The strongest difference between age groups was seen for a bacterial species that is assigned to the genus  which in turn belongs to the family  (adjusted  < 0.0001). Correlation analyses revealed a common relationship in both chicken ages at infection between the absolute abundance of  and , which consists of the genus  In general, concentrations of particular volatile fatty acids (VFA) demonstrated a negative correlation to absolute abundance of , whereby the strongest link was seen for n-butyrate (-0.51141;  < 0.0001).

Obesity in children is also on rise, indicating the urgent need of strategies for prevention and intervention that must begin in early life. While originally posited that obesity results from the simple concept of consuming more calories, or genetics, emerging research suggests that the bacteria living in our gut (gut ) and its interactions with immune cells and metabolic organs including adipose tissues (-immune-metabolic axis) play significant role in obesity development in childhood. Specifically, abnormal changes (dysbiosis) in the gut , stimulation of inflammatory cytokines, and shifts in the metabolic functions of brown adipose tissue and the browning of white adipose tissue are associated with increased obesity. Many factors from as early as gestation appear to contribute in obesity, such as maternal health, diet, antibiotic use by mother and/or child, and birth and feeding methods. Herein, using evidence from animal and human studies, we discuss how these factors impact -immune-metabolic axis and cause obesity epidemic in children, and describe the gaps in knowledge that are warranted for future research.© 2019 World Obesity Federation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660406>The Effect of Antiretroviral Therapy Initiation on the Vaginal  in HIV-Infected Women.</a></h2><p>The impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation on the vaginal  is unknown.

Antibiotics perturb the bacterial gut composition but the extent of these changes and potential consequences for animal and human health is still debated. Six calves were housed in a controlled environment. Three animals received an injection of the antibiotic florfenicol (Nuflor), and three received no treatment. Faecal samples were collected at 0, 3 and 7 days, and bacterial communities were profiled to assess the impact of a therapy on the gut . Phylogenetic analysis (16S-rDNA) established that at day 7, antibiotic-treated  showed a 10-fold increase in facultative anaerobic Escherichia spp, a signature of imbalanced , dysbiosis. The antibiotic resistome showed a high background of antibiotic resistance genes, which did not significantly change in response to florfenicol. However, the maintenance of Escherichia coli plasmid-encoded quinolone, oqxB and propagation of mcr-2, and colistin resistance genes were observed and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The  of treated animals was enriched with energy harvesting bacteria, common to obese microbial communities. We propose that antibiotic treatment of healthy animals leads to unbalanced, disease- and obese-related  that promotes growth of E. coli carrying resistance genes on mobile elements, potentially increasing the risk of transmission of antibiotic resistant bacteria to humans.© 2019 The Authors.

The relative efficacy of fecal  transplantation (FMT) on IBS symptoms was demonstrated in a double-blind, randomized study.We describe the case of a 73-year-old woman suffering from IBS (abdominal pain, bloating, and abundant and disabling diarrhea, with 10-15 stools a day) and repetitive urinary tract infection (UTI; 5 episodes in 6 months, including 3 the last 2 months) for several years, generating an impaired quality of life.

With the next-generation sequencing methodologies, more knowledge is gathered about gut  and its irreplaceable role in keeping the balance between human health and diseases is figured out. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are one of the most innovational cancer immunotherapies across cancer types and significantly expand the therapeutic options of cancer patients. However, a proportion of patients show no effective responses or develop immune-related adverse events when responses do occur. More important, it is demonstrated that the therapeutic response or treatment-limiting toxicity of cancer immunotherapy can be ameliorated or diminished by gut  modulation. In this review, we first introduce the relationship between gut  and cancer immunotherapy. And then, we expound the impact of gut  on efficacy and toxicity of cancer immunotherapy. Further, we review approaches to manipulating gut  to regulate response to ICIs.

Agricultural domestication of soils, that is, the conversion of previously uncultivated soils to a cultivated state, is frequently accompanied by intensive monoculture, especially in the developing world. However, there is limited understanding of how continuous cultivation alters the structure of prokaryotic soil  after soil domestication, including to what extent crop plants impact soil  composition, and how changes in  composition arising from cultivation affect crop performance.We show here that continuous monoculture (> 8 growing seasons) of the major food crop rice under flooded conditions is associated with a pronounced shift in soil bacterial and archaeal  structure towards a more consistent composition, thereby domesticating  of previously uncultivated sites. Aside from the potential effects of agricultural cultivation practices, we provide evidence that rice plants themselves are important drivers of the domestication process, acting through selective enrichment of specific taxa, including methanogenic archaea, in their rhizosphere that differ from those of native plants growing in the same environment. Furthermore, we find that  from soils domesticated by rice cultivation contribute to plant-soil feedback, by imparting a negative effect on rice seedling vigor.Soil domestication through continuous monoculture cultivation of rice results in compositional changes in the soil , which are in part driven by the rice plants.

The urban environment differs greatly from that in which humans evolved, with potentially important consequences for health. Rates for allergic, inflammatory and auto-immune diseases appear to rise with urbanization and be higher in the more urbanized nations of the world which has led some to suggest that cities promote the occurrence of these diseases. However, there are no syntheses outlining what urban-associated diseases are and what characteristics of cities promote their occurrence.To synthesize the current understanding of "urban-associated diseases", and discover the common, potentially modifiable features of cities that may be driving these associations.We focus on any diseases that have been associated with cities or are particularly prominent in today's urban societies. We draw on expertise across diverse health fields to examine the evidence for urban connections and drivers.We found evidence for urban associations across allergic, auto-immune, inflammatory, lifestyle and infectious disease categories. Some conditions (e.g. obesity and diabetes) have complex relationships with cities that have been insufficiently explored. Other conditions (e.g. allergies and asthma) have more evidence demonstrating their relationship with cities and the mechanisms driving that association. Unsurprisingly, air pollution was the characteristic of cities most frequently associated with disease. Other identified urban risk factors are not as widely known: altered microbial exposure and a disconnect from environmental microbiomes, vitamin D deficiency, noise and light pollution, and a transient, over-crowded, impoverished population. However, many complexities and caveats to these relationships beg clarification; we highlight the current knowledge gaps and outline ways to fill those gaps. Identifying urban-associated diseases and their drivers will allow us to prepare for the urban-disease burden of the future and create healthy cities that mitigate that disease burden.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We investigated if this applies to eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Stool bacterial DNA was extracted and followed by 16S rRNA amplification from 12 patients with eosinophilic esophagitis and 12 controls. Alpha- and beta-diversity were analyzed. Only two patients had asthma or atopy and one patient was on budesonide. No patients were on PPIs. Patients with EoE had lower gut  alpha diversity (species richness, P = 0.09; Shannon index, P = 0.01). The microbial composition was distinct as evidenced by significantly different beta diversity (P = 0.03) when compared to healthy controls. There were also significant differences in relative abundance at multiple taxonomic levels when comparing the two communities; at the phylum level, we observed a marked decrease in Firmicutes and increase in Bacteroidetes and at the order and family level there were significant decreases in Clostridia and Clostridiales in patients with EoE (q ≤ 0.1). We conclude that there are significant differences in microbial community structure, microbial richness, and evenness and a significant decrease in taxa within the Clostridia in patients with EoE. Our data suggest that Clostridia based interventions could be tested as adjuncts to current therapeutic strategies in EoE.© 2019 The Authors.

PHT is an important driver of hepatic decompensation such as development of ascites or variceal bleeding. Dysbiosis and an impaired intestinal barrier in ACLD facilitate translocation of bacteria and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that promote disease progression  immune system activation with subsequent induction of proinflammatory and profibrogenic pathways. Congestive portal venous blood flow represents a critical pathophysiological mechanism linking PHT to increased intestinal permeability: The intestinal barrier function is affected by impaired microcirculation, neoangiogenesis, and abnormal vascular and mucosal permeability. The close bidirectional relationship between the gut and the liver has been termed "gut-liver axis". Treatment strategies targeting the gut-liver axis by modulation of  composition and function, intestinal barrier integrity, as well as amelioration of liver fibrosis and PHT are supposed to exert beneficial effects. The activation of the farnesoid X receptor in the liver and the gut was associated with beneficial effects in animal experiments, however, further studies regarding efficacy and safety of pharmacological FXR modulation in patients with ACLD are needed. In this review, we summarize the clinical impact of PHT on the course of liver disease, discuss the underlying pathophysiological link of PHT to gut-liver axis signaling, and provide insight into molecular mechanisms that may represent novel therapeutic targets.©The Author(s) 2019.

Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis revealed that more than 400 genes were upregulated in infants with BPD. Genes upregulated in BPD infants were significantly enriched for functions related to red blood cell development and oxygen transport, while several immune-related pathways were downregulated. We also identified a gene expression signature consistent with an enrichment of immunosuppressive CD71 early erythroid cells in infants with BPD.

However, it is unclear whether the gut  will change significantly when adding different proportions of ryegrass. In this study, 240 healthy male Yangzhou geese (28 days old) with similar body weights were randomly divided into four groups and fed different proportions grass (CK, whole commercial diets; EG1, ryegrass: commercial diets = 1.5:1; EG2, ryegrass: commercial diets = 2:1; EG3, ryegrass: commercial diets = 3:1) respectively. When the geese grew to 70 days old, their intestines were collected and high-throughput sequencing technology was performed to investigate the microbial diversity in the caecum of geese with different dietary supplements. There was no obvious change in the alpha diversity of gut  of geese with ryegrass intake (P > 0.05) and the composition of dominant bacterium (including Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) was also similar. However, the ratio between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes was remarkably reduced with ryegrass intake (P < 0.05), and the relative abundance of 30 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) significantly differed. Additionally, the content of cellulose-degrading  such as Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010 were significantly increased in geese fed with increasing amounts of grass. Finally, the functional profiles of the goose gut  were explored using the PICRUSt tool. Carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism were dominant metabolic pathways. Lipid metabolism was significantly increased in EG3 compared that in the CK group (P < 0.05). Interestingly, Turicibacter and Parasutterella may have affected abdominal fat deposition as grass intake increased. Taken together, although the diversity of bacterial communities was similar in geese fed with different proportions of ryegrass, cellulose-degrading  (Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010) were abundant and the lipid metabolic pathway was enriched, which may reduce abdominal fat accumulation in high-ryegrass fed geese.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649646>Microbial Metabolic Capacity for Intestinal Folate Production and Modulation of Host Folate Receptors.</a></h2><p>Microbial metabolites, including B complex vitamins contribute to diverse aspects of human health. Folate, or vitamin B, refers to a broad category of biomolecules that include pterin, para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA), and glutamate subunits. Folates are required for DNA synthesis and epigenetic regulation. In addition to dietary nutrients, the gut  has been recognized as a source of B complex vitamins, including folate. This study evaluated the predicted folate synthesis capabilities in the genomes of human commensal microbes identified in the Human  Project and folate production by representative strains of six human intestinal bacterial phyla. Bacterial folate synthesis genes were ubiquitous across 512 gastrointestinal reference genomes with 13% of the genomes containing all genes required for complete  folate synthesis. An additional 39% of the genomes had the genetic capacity to synthesize folates in the presence of pABA, an upstream intermediate that can be obtained through diet or from other intestinal microbes. Bacterial folate synthesis was assessed during exponential and stationary phase growth through the evaluation of expression of select folate synthesis genes, quantification of total folate production, and analysis of folate polyglutamylation. Increased expression of key folate synthesis genes was apparent in exponential phase, and increased folate polyglutamylation occurred during late stationary phase. Of the folate producers, we focused on the commensal  to examine host-microbe interactions in relation to folate and examined folate receptors in the physiologically relevant human enteroid model. RNAseq data revealed segment-specific folate receptor distribution. Treatment of human colonoid monolayers with conditioned media (CM) from wild-type  did not influence the expression of key folate transporters proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) or reduced folate carrier (RFC). However, CM from  containing a site-specific inactivation of the  gene, which prevents the bacteria from synthesizing a polyglutamate tail on folate, significantly upregulated RFC expression. No effects were observed using  with a site inactivation of , which results in no folate production. This work sheds light on the contributions of microbial folate to overall folate status and mammalian host metabolism.Copyright © 2019 Engevik, Morra, Röth, Engevik, Spinler, Devaraj, Crawford, Estes, Kalkum and Versalovic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651035>Airborne medicine - bacterial volatiles and their influence on plant health.</a></h2><p>Like most other eukaryotes, plants do not live alone but in close association with a diverse microflora.

Different sites of colorectal cancer (CRC) are different in many aspects, including clinical symptoms, biological behaviour, and prognosis.This study aimed to analyse prognosis, genes, bacteria, fungi, and microbial metabolome in different sites of CRC.The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and STAT were used to statistically describe and analyse the prognosis in different sites of CRC. RNA sequences of CRC from Broad Institute's GDAC Firehose were re-annotated and reanalysed based on different sites using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyse the prognosis and Cytoscape was used to construct a drug-target network based on DGIdb databases. Bacterial 16S V3-V4 and fungal ITS V3-V4 ribosomal RNA genes of stool samples were sequenced. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GS/MS) was performed to detect the microbial metabolites in stool samples. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to compare distinct gut microorganisms and microbial metabolites between rectal and sigmoid cancers.The prognosis in CRC with different sites is significantly different. The closer to the anus predicted longer survival time. The difference between genes and co-expression pairs in CRC with different sites were constructed. The relative abundance of 112 mRNAs and 26 lncRNAs correlated with the sites of CRC were listed. Nine differentially expressed genes at different sites of CRC were correlated with prognosis.

The GM is well-known to be involved in the pathological process of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism of OMVs is not clear. In the present study, we demonstrated the involvement of OMVs in the development of cognitive (learning and memory) dysfunction induced by blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. More important, further study showed that OMVs induced tau phosphorylation by activating glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) in the hippocampus. OMVs activated astrocytes and microglia, increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines (nuclear factor κB, interleukin-1β, and tumour necrosis factor-α) in the hippocampus. Therefore, OMVs increase the permeability of the BBB and promote the activation of astrocytes and microglia, inducing an inflammatory response and tau hyperphosphorylation by activating the GSK-3β pathway and finally leading to cognitive impairment.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649246>Fungal-bacterial diversity and  complexity predict ecosystem functioning.</a></h2><p>The soil  is highly diverse and comprises up to one quarter of Earth's diversity. Yet, how such a diverse and functionally complex  influences ecosystem functioning remains unclear. Here we manipulated the soil  in experimental grassland ecosystems and observed that  diversity and microbial network complexity positively influenced multiple ecosystem functions related to nutrient cycling (e.g. multifunctionality). Grassland microcosms with poorly developed microbial networks and reduced microbial richness had the lowest multifunctionality due to fewer taxa present that support the same function (redundancy) and lower diversity of taxa that support different functions (reduced  functional uniqueness). Moreover, different microbial taxa explained different ecosystem functions pointing to the significance of functional diversity in microbial communities. These findings indicate the importance of microbial interactions within and among fungal and bacterial communities for enhancing ecosystem performance and demonstrate that the extinction of complex ecological associations belowground can impair ecosystem functioning.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657871>Evaluating Bioinformatic Pipeline Performance for Forensic  Analysis.</a></h2><p>Microbial communities have potential evidential utility for forensic applications. However, bioinformatic analysis of high-throughput sequencing data varies widely among laboratories. These differences can potentially affect microbial community composition and downstream analyses. To illustrate the importance of standardizing methodology, we compared analyses of postmortem  samples using several bioinformatic pipelines, varying minimum library size or minimum number of sequences per sample, and sample size. Using the same input sequence data, we found that three open-source bioinformatic pipelines, MG-RAST, mothur, and QIIME2, had significant differences in relative abundance, alpha-diversity, and beta-diversity, despite the same input data. Increasing minimum library size and sample size increased the number of low-abundant and infrequent taxa detected. Our results show that bioinformatic pipeline and parameter choice affect results in important ways. Given the growing potential application of forensic microbiology to the criminal justice system, continued research on standardizing computational methodology will be important for downstream applications.© 2019 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652909>From the Table to the Tumor: The Role of Mediterranean and Western Dietary Patterns in Shifting Microbial-Mediated Signaling to Impact Breast Cancer Risk.</a></h2><p>Diet is a modifiable component of lifestyle that could influence breast cancer development. The Mediterranean dietary pattern is considered one of the healthiest of all dietary patterns. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet protects against diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Reported consumption of a Mediterranean diet pattern was associated with lower breast cancer risk for women with all subtypes of breast cancer, and a Western diet pattern was associated with greater risk. In this review, we contrast the available epidemiological breast cancer data, comparing the impact of consuming a Mediterranean diet to the Western diet. Furthermore, we will review the preclinical data highlighting the anticancer molecular mechanism of Mediterranean diet consumption in both cancer prevention and therapeutic outcomes. Diet composition is a major constituent shaping the gut . Distinct patterns of gut  composition are associated with the habitual consumption of animal fats, high-fiber diets, and vegetable-based diets. We will review the impact of Mediterranean diet on the gut  and inflammation. Outside of the gut, we recently demonstrated that Mediterranean diet consumption led to distinct  shifts in the mammary gland tissue, suggesting possible anticancer effects by diet on breast-specific .

In this conversion, most of the plant materials are digested by rumen fermentation and are changed to short-chain fatty acids, microbial cells, and methane, which is released into the atmosphere. The relationships among feed, rumen fermentation, and milk production are poorly understood. Here we report a novel indicator of characteristics of rumen fermentation, theoretical turnover rate (TTOR) of the rumen liquid fraction. The TTOR was calculated from the presumed rumen volume (PRV) which is estimated by dividing the methane yield by the methane concentration of rumen fluid. The formula for the TTOR is: TTOR = PRV/body weight . Our present analyses confirm that the TTOR as an indicator is capable of connecting feed, rumen fermentation, and milk production, because dry matter intake/TTOR showed a strong correlation with milk yield/TTOR. In addition, the TTOR may be related to ruminal pH, as we observed that the ruminal pH decreased as the TTOR increased. We propose that the TTOR is a factor characterizing rumen fermentation and a good indicator of the productivity of ruminants and dysbiosis of the rumen .© 2019 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659451>Anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047 on high-fat and high-fructose diet mice base on inflammatory response alleviation and gut  regulation.</a></h2><p>The objective of the study was to evaluate the anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047, and illustrate the potential functional mechanism about the alleviation of high fat and high fructose diet (HFFD) induced obesity and related metabolic abnormalities.C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a standard or HFFD with or without supplementation of L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 for 10 weeks. Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut  composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut  variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut  by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut , which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656993>The gut  to the brain axis in the metabolic control.</a></h2><p>The regulation of glycemia is under a tight neuronal detection of glucose levels performed by the gut-brain axis and an efficient efferent neuronal message sent to the peripheral organs, as the pancreas to induce insulin and inhibit glucagon secretions.

The rat model of sepsis was reproduced by injection of 10 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via tail vein, the rats in the NS control group was given the same amount of NS. The rats in the fecal  transplantation group received nasogastric infusion of feces from healthy donor on the 1st day, 2 mL each time, for 3 times a day, the other two groups were given equal dose of NS by gavage. Fecal samples were collected on the 7th day after modeling, the levels of intestinal  composition was determined using the 16SrDNA gene sequencing technology. The brain function was evaluated by electroencephalogram (EEG), and the proportion of each waveform in EEG was calculated.

However, due to the diverse processing conditions applied across Europe, it remained unclear to which degree bacterial heterogeneity can be encountered in commercially available fermented meat products and whether this is linked to their geographical origin. Therefore, the bacterial species diversity of 80 fermented meat products available in the Belgian retail, coming from five different countries, was investigated. It was also assessed how this related to the country of origin and the key processing parameters pH and salt concentration. The samples originated from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.

In contrast, Northern European fermented meat products were generally more acidified and showed a higher prevalence of  in their LAB communities, whereas  represented the CNS communities. Non-parametric statistical tests indicated the impact of the geographical origin on the prevalence of the LAB and CNS species.

Extensive data collected over the past decades on this chronic disease demonstrate that its progression is infrequent and episodic, and the susceptibility to it can vary among individuals. Physical assessments of previously occurring damage to periodontal tissues remain the cornerstone of detection and diagnosis, whereas traditionally used diagnostic procedures do neither identify susceptible individuals nor distinguish between disease-active and disease-inactive periodontal sites. Thus, more sensitive and accurate "measurable biological indicators" of periodontal diseases are needed in order to place diagnosis (e.g., the presence or stage) and management of the disease on a more rational less empirical basis. Contemporary "omics" technologies may help unlock the path to this quest. High throughput nucleic acid sequencing technologies have enabled us to examine the taxonomic distribution of microbial communities in oral health and disease, whereas proteomic technologies allowed us to decipher the molecular state of the host in disease, as well as the interactive cross-talk of the host with the . The newly established field of metaproteomics has enabled the identification of the repertoire of proteins that oral microorganisms use to compete or co-operate with each other. Vast such data is derived from oral biological fluids, including gingival crevicular fluid and saliva, which is progressively completed and catalogued as the analytical technologies and bioinformatics tools progressively advance.

Nutritional status has a clear relationship with disease outcomes, and malnutrition in CF is typically a result of chronic negative energy balance secondary to malabsorption. As the mechanisms underlying the pathology of CF and its implications on nutrient absorption and energy expenditure have been elucidated, nutrition support has become increasingly sophisticated. Comprehensive nutrition monitoring and treatment guidelines from professional and advocacy organizations have unified the approach to nutrition optimization around the world. Newborn screening allows for early nutrition intervention and improvement in short- and long-term growth and other clinical outcomes. The nutrition support goal in CF care includes achieving optimal nutritional status to support growth and pubertal development in children, maintenance of optimal nutritional status in adult life, and optimizing fat soluble vitamin and essential fatty acid status. The mainstay of this approach is a high calorie, high-fat diet, exceeding age, and sex energy intake recommendations for healthy individuals. For patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, enzyme replacement therapy is required to improve fat and calorie absorption. Enzyme dosing varies by age and dietary fat intake. Multiple potential impediments to absorption, including decreased motility, altered gut luminal bile salt and  composition, and enteric inflammation must be considered. Fat soluble vitamin supplementation is required in patients with pancreatic insufficiency.

RbgA is one of these GTPases and is required for the assembly of the 50S subunit in most bacteria. Homologs of this protein are also implicated in the assembly of the large subunit of the mitochondrial and eukaryotic ribosome. We present here the cryo-electron microscopy structure of RbgA bound to a Bacillus subtilis 50S subunit assembly intermediate (45SRbgA particle) that accumulates in cells upon RbgA depletion. Binding of RbgA at the P site of the immature particle stabilizes functionally important rRNA helices in the A and P-sites, prior to the completion of the maturation process of the subunit. The structure also reveals the location of the highly conserved N-terminal end of RbgA containing the catalytic residue Histidine 9. The derived model supports a mechanism of GTP hydrolysis, and it shows that upon interaction of RbgA with the 45SRbgA particle, Histidine 9 positions itself near the nucleotide potentially acting as the catalytic residue with minimal rearrangements.

Members of these communities have been reported with variable prevalence and pathogenicity, mainly depending on their host and environment (e.g. lifespan, distribution, habitat, diet, health status and stressors). Indeed, many species commonly inhabiting the sea turtle gastrointestinal tract exhibit an opportunistic behaviour. This study aimed to provide baseline data on enterobacterial and parasitic composition, through bacteriological culture-based methods and the FLOTAC parasitological technique, in cloacal and faecal samples of 30 live Caretta caretta, examined upon their arrival at the Marine Turtle Research Centre (Portici, Italy).Enterobacteriaceae were isolated in 18/23 cloacal samples (78.3%), with Citrobacter and Morganella as the most common genera, followed by Proteus, Enterobacter, Providencia, and Hafnia. Parasitic elements were detected in 11/30 faecal samples (36.7%), with Enodiotrema, Rhytidodes, and Eimeria as most common genera, followed by Pachypsolus and Cymatocarpus. Additionally, Angiodyctium is reported for the first time in this host. The majority (47.8%) of sea turtles hosted exclusively Enterobacteriaceae, whereas 30.4% hosted both parasites and Enterobacteriaceae; the remaining 21.8% hosted neither of the agents.Bacteria and parasites evaluated in the present study are common in Mediterranean loggerhead sea turtles, with slight differences between the western and eastern basin. Although naturally present in the gastrointestinal system of free-living sea turtles, their relationship with these hosts might range from mutualism to parasitism. Indeed, members of the gut community might express their pathogenic potential in immune-compromised animals, such as those in rehabilitation facilities. Therefore, it is advisable to include in the standard work-up of rescued sea turtles a screening procedure for such opportunistic agents, in order to better evaluate the animal's health status and achieve timely intervention with appropriate treatment, thus improving rehabilitation. Furthermore, data collected from free-living sea turtles represent a starting point for investigating wild populations.

Stool metatranscriptomic analysis offers a comprehensive functional view of the gut , but despite its usefulness, it has rarely been used in clinical studies due to its complexity, cost, and bioinformatic challenges. This method has also received criticism due to potential intrasample variability, rapid changes, and RNA degradation. Here, we describe a robust and automated stool metatranscriptomic method, called Viomega, which was specifically developed for population-scale studies. Viomega includes sample collection, ambient temperature sample preservation, total RNA extraction, physical removal of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), preparation of directional Illumina libraries, Illumina sequencing, taxonomic classification based on a database of >110,000 microbial genomes, and quantitative microbial gene expression analysis using a database of ~100 million microbial genes. We applied this method to 10,000 human stool samples and performed several small-scale studies to demonstrate sample stability and consistency. In summary, Viomega is an inexpensive, high-throughput, automated, and accurate sample-to-result stool metatranscriptomic technology platform for large-scale studies and a wide range of applications.Copyright © 2019 Andrew Hatch et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659687>Propionate, together with triple antibiotics, inhibits the growth of Enterococci.</a></h2><p>Enterococci are Gram-positive facultative anaerobic bacteria that colonize the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. Enterococcal infections, mainly caused by Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, include apical periodontitis, endocarditis, and bloodstream infections. Recently, vancomycinresistant Enterococci are considered major pathogens that are common but difficult to treat, especially in nosocomial settings. Moreover, E. faecalis is closely associated with recurrent endodontic infections and failed endodontic treatment. In this study, we investigated the effects of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), acetate, propionate, and butyrate, which are metabolites fermented by gut , on the growth of Enterococci. Enterococci were cultured in the presence or absence of acetate, propionate, or butyrate, and the optical density at 600 nm was measured to determine bacterial growth. The minimum inhibitory concentration/minimum bactericidal concentration test was conducted. Bacteria were treated with a SCFA, together with clinically used endodontic treatment methods such as triple antibiotics (metronidazole, minocycline, and ciprofloxacin) and chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) to determine the effects of combination treatment. Of the SCFAs, propionate had a bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of E. faecalis in a dose-dependent manner and also that of clinical strains of E. faecalis isolated from dental plaques. Meanwhile, acetate and butyrate had minimal effects on E. faecalis growth. Moreover, propionate inhibited the growth of other Enterococci including E. faecium. In addition, combination treatment of propionate and triple antibiotics led to further growth inhibition, whereas no cooperative effect was observed at propionate plus CHX. These results indicate that propionate attenuates the growth of Enterococci, suggesting propionate as a potential agent to control Enterococcal infections, especially when combined with triple antibiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652705>Gut  Profiles Differ among Individuals Depending on Their Region of Origin: An Italian Pilot Study.</a></h2><p> heterogeneity among humans is mainly due to genetic background, age, dietary habits, lifestyle and local environments.

Our results underline the importance of studies on population-specific variations in human  composition leading to geographically tailored approaches to  engineering.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654610>Associations between the vaginal  and Candida colonization in women of reproductive age.</a></h2><p>The composition of bacteria within the vaginal  has garnered a lot of recent attention and has been associated with reproductive health and disease. Despite the common occurrence of yeast (primarily Candida) within the vaginal , there is still an incomplete picture of relationships between yeast and bacteria (especially lactobacilli), as well as how such associations are governed. Such relationships could be important to a more holistic understanding of the vaginal  and its connection to reproductive health.To perform molecular characterization of clinical specimens to define associations between vaginal bacteria (especially Lactobacillus species) and Candida colonization. In vitro studies were conducted to test the two most common dominant Lactobacillus species (Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus iners) in their ability to inhibit Candida growth and to examine the basis for such inhibition.A nested cross-sectional study of reproductive age women from the Contraceptive CHOICE Project was conducted. Vaginal swabs from 299 women were selected to balance race and BV status, resulting in similar representation of black and white women in each of the three Nugent score categories [normal (0-3), intermediate (4-6), and bacterial vaginosis (7-10)]. Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal gene (V4 region) was used to determine the dominant Lactobacillus species present (primarily L. iners and L. crispatus), defined as >50% of the community. Subjects without dominance by a single Lactobacillus species were classified as Diverse. A Candida-specific qPCR targeting the internally transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) was validated using vaginal samples collected from a second cohort of women and used to assess Candida colonization. 255 nonpregnant women with sufficient bacterial biomass for analysis were included in the final analysis. Generalized linear models were employed to evaluate associations between Lactobacillus dominance, sociodemographic and risk characteristics and vaginal Candida colonization. In separate in vitro studies, the potential of cell-free supernatants from L. crispatus and L. iners cultures to inhibit Candida growth was evaluated.Forty-two women (16%) were vaginally colonized with Candida. Microbiomes characterized as Diverse (38%), L. iners-dominant (39%), and L. crispatus-dominant (20%) were the most common. The , race and Candida colonization co-varied with a higher prevalence of Candida among black women and L. iners-dominant communities compared to white women and L. crispatus-dominant communities. L. iners-dominant communities were more likely to harbor Candida than L. crispatus-dominant communities (OR = 2.85, 95% CI: 1.03 to 7.21; Fisher's Exact, p = 0.048). In vitro, L. crispatus produced greater concentrations of lactic acid and exhibited significantly more pH-dependent growth inhibition of C. albicans, suggesting a potential mechanism for the clinical observations.In nonpregnant women, L. iners-dominant communities were significantly more likely to harbor Candida than L. crispatus-dominant communities, suggesting that Lactobacillus species have different relationships with Candida. In vitro experiments indicate that L. crispatus may impede Candida colonization more effectively than L. iners through a greater production of lactic acid.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Given the importance of the spinal cord as a locomotor control center and the public perception that paralysis is the defining feature of SCI, this "spinal-centric" focus is logical. Unfortunately, such a focus likely will not yield new discoveries that reverse other devastating consequences of SCI including cardiovascular and metabolic disease, bladder/bowel dysfunction and infection. The current review considers how SCI changes the physiological interplay between the spinal cord, the gut and the immune system. A suspected culprit in causing many of the pathological manifestations of impaired spinal cord-gut-immune axis homeostasis is the gut . After SCI, the composition of the gut  changes, creating a chronic state of gut "dysbiosis". To date, much of what we know about gut dysbiosis was learned from 16S-based taxonomic profiling studies that reveal changes in the composition and abundance of various bacteria. However, this approach has limitations and creates taxonomic "blindspots". Notably, only bacteria can be analyzed. Thus, in this review we also discuss how the application of emerging sequencing technologies can improve our understanding of how the broader ecosystem in the gut is affected by SCI. Specifically, metagenomics will provide researchers with a more comprehensive look at post-injury changes in the gut virome (and mycome). Metagenomics also allows changes in microbe population dynamics to be linked to specific microbial functions that can affect the development and progression of metabolic disease, immune dysfunction and affective disorders after SCI. As these new tools become more readily available and used across the research community, the development of an "ecogenomic" toolbox will facilitate an Eco-Systems Biology approach to study the complex interplay along the spinal cord-gut-immune axis after SCI.Copyright © 2018.

M cells actively transport luminal antigens to the underlying lymphoid follicles to initiate an immune response. The molecular machinery of M-cell differentiation and function has been vigorously investigated over the last decade. Studies have shed light on the role of M cells in the mucosal immune system and have revealed that antigen uptake by M cells contributes to not only mucosal but also systemic immune responses. However, M-cell studies usually focus on infectious diseases; the contribution of M cells to autoimmune diseases has remained largely unexplored. Accumulating evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the intestinal  is implicated in multiple systemic diseases, including autoimmune diseases. This implies that the uptake of microorganisms by M cells in PPs may play a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. We provide an outline of the current understanding of M-cell biology and subsequently discuss the potential contribution of M cells and PPs to the induction of systemic autoimmunity, beyond the mucosal immune response.Copyright © 2019 Kobayashi, Takahashi, Takano, Kimura and Hase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649640>Editorial: Characterizing Modern Microbialites and the Geobiological Processes Underlying Their Formation.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663730>Targeting regorafenib-induced toxicity through inhibition of gut microbial β-glucuronidases.</a></h2><p>Regorafenib (Stivarga®) is an oral small molecule kinase inhibitor used to treat metastatic colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinomas, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Diarrhea is one of the most frequently observed adverse reactions associated with regorafenib. This toxicity may arise from the reactivation of the inactive regorafenib-glucuronide to regorafenib in the gastrointestinal tract by gut microbial β-glucuronidase (GUS) enzymes. We sought to unravel the molecular basis of regorafenib-glucuronide processing by human intestinal GUS enzymes, and to examine the potential inhibition of these enzymes. Using a panel of 31 unique gut microbial GUS enzymes derived from the 279 mapped from the human gut , we found that only four were capable of regorafenib-glucuronide processing. Using crystal structures as a guide, we pinpointed the molecular features unique to these enzymes that confer regorafenib-glucuronide processing activity. Furthermore, a pilot screen identified the FDA-approved drug raloxifene as an inhibitor of regorafenib-reactivation by the GUS proteins discovered. Novel synthetic raloxifene analogs exhibited improved potency in both in vitro and ex vivo studies. Taken together, these data establish that regorafenib reactivation is exclusively catalyzed by gut microbial enzymes, and that these enzymes are amenable to targeted inhibition. Our results unravel key molecular details of regorafenib reactivation in the GI tract and provide a potential pathway to improve clinical outcomes with regorafenib.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651219>Human Nasal  as Characterized by Metagenomics Differs Markedly Between Rural and Industrial Communities in Egypt.</a></h2><p>Microbial communities residing in the nose play important roles in human health and disease. We report marked differences in nasal  between a rural community and an industrial setting located near a major urban city. Nasal samples were collected from 19 healthy male subjects: 9 samples from persons living in a rural village, and 10 samples from ceramic factory workers in a major industrial Egyptian city. The nasal  in the rural sample had higher and distinct diversity compared with industrial samples from workers exposed to pollution daily. Taxonomic analysis of the sequences revealed five major phyla; among these phyla were Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria, revealing significant abundance variation by geographical location. For example, the rural group had a significant increase in representation of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes ( = 0.004,  = 0.01, respectively) compared with the industrial group. However, the industrial group showed a significant increase in relative abundance of phylum Proteobacteria ( = 0.02). The most predominant genera for the rural group were , , , and  By contrast, the industrial group was dominated by , , and  Environmental pollution might alter the nasal  leading to an attendant disturbance in the  community structure. The clinical and public health implications of these nasal  variations by rural and industrialized geography warrant further research.

An obstacle to understanding this contradiction has been a shortage of in vivo models reproducing the unique structure and immunology of human skin. In this work, we developed a humanized model to study how healthy adult human skin responds to colonizing methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). We demonstrate the importance of the outer stratum corneum as the major site of bacterial colonization and how noninvasive MRSA adhesion to corneocytes induces a local inflammatory response in underlying skin layers. This signaling recruits neutrophils to the skin, where they control bacterial numbers, mediating transiency in colonization. This work highlights the spatiotemporal aspects of human skin colonization and demonstrates a subclinical inflammatory response to noninvasive MRSA that allows human skin to regulate the bacterial population at its outer surface.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

In mammals, host phylogeny is one of the main drivers of gut , a result of vertical transfer of  during birth. In birds, it is less clear what the drivers might be, but both phylogeny and environmental factors may play a role. We investigated host and environmental factors that underlie variation in gut  composition in eight species of migratory shorebirds. We characterized bacterial communities from 375 fecal samples collected from adults of eight shorebird species captured at a network of nine breeding sites in the Arctic and sub-Arctic ecoregions of North America, by sequencing the V4 region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Firmicutes (55.4%), Proteobacteria (13.8%), Fusobacteria (10.2%), and Bacteroidetes (8.1%) dominated the gut  of adult shorebirds. Breeding location was the main driver of variation in gut  of breeding shorebirds (  = 11.6%), followed by shorebird host species (  = 1.8%), and sampling year (  = 0.9%), but most variation remained unexplained. Site variation resulted from differences in the core bacterial taxa, whereas rare, low-abundance bacteria drove host species variation.

However, it is unknown whether sialylated lactuloses have modulatory effects on the intestinal . In this study, 60 healthy mice were randomly divided into six groups, namely, a normal control group, a lactulose group, a Kdn-α2,3-lactulose group, a Kdn-α2,6-lactulose group, a Neu5Ac-α2,3-lactulose group, and a Neu5Ac-α2,6-lactulose group. After 14 days of lactulose administration, the feces of three mice from each group were collected, and the intestinal  were detected by Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing targeting the V3-V4 region of the 16S rDNA gene. At the phylum level, the relative abundance of Firmicutes was increased in the sialylated lactulose groups, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes was decreased. At the family level, sialylated lactulose intervention decreased the relative abundance of Bacteroidales S24-7 group and Helicobacteraceae and enhanced the abundance of Lactobacillaceae, which reflects the modulatory effect of sialylated lactulose on intestinal . Diversity analysis indicated that the index of Chao was higher in the sialylated lactulose groups than in the normal control group, and the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices were higher in the Kdnα-2,6-lactulose group and the Neu5Ac-α2,3-lactulose group than in the normal control group. The results of the intestinal  sample composition indicated that there were differences between the sialylated lactulose groups and the normal control group.

Although drought stress declined the growth of licorice plants, these decreases were partly recovered by DSE inoculation. Specifically, the inoculation of  and  significantly increased the biomass and glycyrrhizin content, whereas  and  increased glycyrrhizic acid content of host plants under drought stress. However, the inoculation of  showed significant negative effects on the shoot, root, and total biomass of licorice plants. In addition, the effects of DSE inoculation on the morphological, photosynthetic, and antioxidant parameters of licorice plants, and mineral nutrient and microbial community composition in the rhizosphere soil were dependent on the DSE species as well as water regime. Interestingly, DSE inoculation significantly increased AM fungi content under drought stress. In addition, DSE associated with water had a significant positive influence on soil organic matter, available phosphorus (P), AM fungi, leaf number, soluble protein, SOD activity, total root length, root branch, and glycyrrhizic acid content. Based on the results of variance partitioning analysis, 17.0, 34.0, 14.9, 40.1, 28.2, and 18.0% variations in shoot morphology, root morphology, plant biomass, active ingredient, photosynthetic parameters, and antioxidant parameters, respectively, were attributable to the presence of certain soil microorganisms. These findings suggest the possibility that DSE inoculation improved the root development and nutrient absorption of host plants, altered the soil , and might also contribute to plant growth and survival under drought conditions. As  exhibited positive effects on the plant biomass, morphological and physiological parameters, and active ingredient content in licorice plants under drought stress, it was considered to be the best fungus for licorice cultivation.

The primary processing of Houpo requires sweating treatment, which is a special drying process and is considered to be an essential embodiment of high quality and genuine medicinal materials. The sweating of Houpo leads to peculiar changes in the microbial community structure and the content of main active substances (magnolol, honokiol, syringin and magnoflorine). Variation in the microbial community was considered the cause of the change in content of active substances of Houpo, although the microbial taxa responsible for the improvement of content remain unidentified.In this study, we used MiSeq high-throughput sequencing methods for partial bacterial 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene sequences to compare the bacterial and fungal community structures at different timepoints in the process of sweating.

The diversity of human gut  has been correlated with aging, which was characterized by different abundance of bacteria in various age groups. In the literature, most of the previous studies of age-related gut  changes focused on individual species in the gut community with supervised methods. Here, we aimed to examine the underlying aging progression of the human gut microbial community from an unsupervised perspective.We obtained raw 16S rRNA sequencing data of subjects ranging from newborns to centenarians from a previous study, and summarized the data into a relative abundance matrix of genera in all the samples. Without using the age information of samples, we applied an unsupervised algorithm to recapitulate the underlying aging progression of microbial community from hosts in different age groups and identify genera associated to this progression. Literature review of these identified genera indicated that for individuals with advanced ages, some beneficial genera are lost while some genera related with inflammation and cancer increase.The multivariate unsupervised analysis here revealed the existence of a continuous aging progression of human gut  along with the host aging process.

The intestinal  has various functions including host protection from overgrowth or colonization by unwanted bacteria. The exposure to antibiotics significantly reduces the bacterial density of intestinal  leaving an ecologic void that can be occupied by potentially pathogenic and/or resistant bacteria frequently present in hospital settings. Consequently, the intestinal  of inpatients acts as a major reservoir and plays a critical role in perpetuating the spread of resistant bacteria. There are novel innovative methods to protect the host  during antibiotic treatment, but they do not offer a solution for already established colonization by resistant microorganisms. Fecal  transfer (FMT) is a promising intervention to achieve this goal; however, controlled trials report lower success rates than initial retrospective studies, especially in case of gram negatives. The aim of the present article is to highlight the importance of the intestinal  in the global spread of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms and to review the recent advances to protect the human  from the action of antibiotics as well as a critical discussion about the evidence of decolonization of MDR microorganisms by FMT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653078>The Role of the Gut  in Colorectal Cancer Causation.</a></h2><p>Here, we reviewed emerging evidence on the role of the microbial community in colorectal carcinogenesis. A healthy gut  promotes intestinal homeostasis and can exert anti-cancer effects; however, this  also produces a variety of metabolites that are genotoxic and which can negatively influence epithelial cell behaviour.

Microbial species linked to CRC include certain strains of ,   and   amongst others. Whether these microbes are merely passive dwellers exploiting the tumour environment, or rather, active protagonists in the carcinogenic process is the subject of much research. The incidence of chemically-induced tumours in mice models varies, depending upon the presence or absence of these microorganisms, thus strongly suggesting influences on disease causation. Putative mechanistic explanations differentially link these strains to DNA damage, inflammation, aberrant cell behaviour and immune suppression.

We also found associations between age and specific members and functions of the gut . Consistent with previous studies on the human gut , beneficial microbes including probiotic bacteria and short-chain fatty acid-producers decreased in older pigs, whereas Bacteroides increased with age. Based on the correlation network, Bacteroides seemed to have an important role in determining the relative abundances of other beneficial microbes. Our results suggest that maintaining beneficial gut microbes at a specific ratio corresponding to a certain age might contribute to a younger gut -age.

In this review, we provide a new perspective on succinate as a gut -derived metabolite with a key role governing intestinal homeostasis and energy metabolism. Thus, succinate is not merely a major intermediary of the TCA traditionally considered as an extracellular danger signal in the host, but also a by-product of some bacteria and a primary cross-feeding metabolite between gut resident microbes. In addition to maintain a healthy , specific functions of -derived succinate in peripheral tissues regulating host nutrient metabolism should not be rule out. Indeed, recent research point to some probiotic interventions directed to modulate succinate levels in the intestinal lumen, as a new -based therapies to treat obesity and related co-morbidities. While further research is essential, a large body of evidence point to succinate as a new strategic mediator in the -host cross-talk, which might provide the basis for new therapeutically approaches in a near future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649546>Inflammation in Renal Diseases: New and Old Players.</a></h2><p>Inflammation, a process intimately linked to renal disease, can be defined as a complex network of interactions between renal parenchymal cells and resident immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, coupled with recruitment of circulating monocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils. Once stimulated, these cells activate specialized structures such as Toll-like receptor and Nod-like receptor (NLR). By detecting danger-associated molecules, these receptors can set in motion major innate immunity pathways such as nuclear factor ĸB (NF-ĸB) and NLRP3 inflammasome, causing metabolic reprogramming and phenotype changes of immune and parenchymal cells and triggering the secretion of a number of inflammatory mediators that can cause irreversible tissue damage and functional loss. Growing evidence suggests that this response can be deeply impacted by the crosstalk between the kidneys and other organs, such as the gut. Changes in the composition and/or metabolite production of the gut  can influence inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis, thus offering opportunities to positively manipulate the composition and/or functionality of gut  and, consequentially, ameliorate deleterious consequences of renal diseases. In this review, we summarize the most recent evidence that renal inflammation can be ameliorated by interfering with the gut  through the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics. In addition to these innovative approaches, we address the recent discovery of new targets for drugs long in use in clinical practice. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, NF-ĸB inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and antimetabolic drugs can reduce renal macrophage infiltration and slow down the progression of renal disease by mechanisms independent of those usually attributed to these compounds. Allopurinol, an inhibitor of uric acid production, has been shown to decrease renal inflammation by limiting activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. So far, these protective effects have been shown in experimental studies only. Clinical studies will establish whether these novel strategies can be incorporated into the arsenal of treatments intended to prevent the progression of human disease.Copyright © 2019 Andrade-Oliveira, Foresto-Neto, Watanabe, Zatz and Câmara.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655999>Composition and Structure of Gut  in Adolescents with Obesity and Different Breastfeeding Duration.</a></h2><p>Gut  of adolescents with obesity and different duration of breastfeeding was analyzed by metagenomic analysis of V3-V4 variable domains of the 16S rRNA gene.

Thirty-three strains of lactic acid bacteria of Lactobacillus and Lactococcus genera from the Lomonosov Moscow State University Collection of Microorganisms (CM MSU) have been tested for important probiotic properties which assist these bacteria to settle effectively in intestines: cell adhesion, ability to form biofilms, agglutination with lectin (concanavalin A), and antimicrobial activity.

Moreover, aggressive intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation of patients may alter intestinal flora. Herein, we describe GM changes following a large burn in swine randomized to different volumes of IV Lactated Ringers' (LR).Anesthetized Yorkshire swine sustained 40% Total body surface area full-thickness burns and were randomized to different volumes of IV LR: none (n = 3), 15 mL/kg/day (Low; n = 6), or 80 mL/kg/day (High; n = 6). At baseline and days 1 and 2, fecal swabs were collected for 16 s rDNA sequencing. Proximal jejunum was collected immediately after euthanasia (day 2) for western blot, histopathology, and cytokine analyses.Burns produced significant shifts in β-diversity and non-significant reductions in α-diversity that did not recover regardless of treatment group. Burn-induced increases in Proteobacteria and decreases in Firmicutes were attenuated by IV fluids in a dose-dependent manner, and also correlated with α-diversity. IV fluids caused a dose-dependent increase in Bacteroides and prevented a transient increase in the opportunistic pathogen Haemophilus parainfluenzae. While high volumes of IV fluids increased intestinal Hsp70 levels (p = 0.0464), they reduced SGLT1 (p = 0.0213) and caspase3 (p = 0.0139) levels. IV fluids elicited a non-specific cytokine response however Bacteroidetes levels correlated with intestinal IL18 levels (p = 0.0166, R = 0.4201).We present the first report on the gut  in a porcine burn model, and present data to suggest that IV fluids may influence GM and gut functional proteins following a burn.

To determine the role of  on longevity animal models, we investigated the changes in the GM of df/df and Normal control (N) mice, by comparing parents before mating and littermate mice at three distinct time points during early life. Furthermore, we studied the effects of a 6-month calorie restriction (CR), the most powerful intervention extending the lifespan. Our data revealed significant changes of the GM composition during early life development, and we detected differences in the abundance of some bacteria between df/df and N mice, already in early life. Overall, the variability of the  by genotype, time-point and breeding pair showed significant differences. In addition, CR caused significant changes in  according to gastrointestinal (GI) location (distal colon, ileum and cecum), genotype and diet.

As cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis in particular has been associated with compositional alterations in the gut , we investigated this association in patients with clinically confirmed non-arteritic RAO compared to age- and sex-matched controls. On the phylum level, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was decreased in patients with RAO compared to controls, whereas the opposite applied for the phylum of Proteobacteria. Several genera and species such as Actinobacter, Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides stercoris, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were relatively enriched in patients with RAO, whereas others such as Odoribacter, Parasutterella or Lachnospiraceae were significantly lower.

Systemic antigen-specific immune T- and B-cell memory to a panel of commensal microbes was assessed.Systemically, healthy blood showed CD4 and occasional CD8 memory T-cell responses to selected intestinal bacteria but few memory B-cell responses. In IBD, CD8 memory T-cell responses decreased although B-cell responses and circulating plasmablasts increased. Possibly secondary to loss of systemic CD8 T-cell responses in IBD, dramatically reduced numbers of mucosal CD8+ Trm and γδ T-cells were observed. IgA responses to intraepithelial bacteria were increased. Colonic Trm expressed CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases, characteristic of regulatory T-cells. Cytokines/factors required for Trm differentiation were identified, and in vitro-generated Trm expressed regulatory T-cell function via CD39. Cognate interaction between T-cells and dendritic cells induced T-bet expression in dendritic cells, a key mechanism in regulating cell-mediated mucosal responses.A previously unrecognized imbalance exists between cellular and humoral immunity to the  in IBD, with loss of mucosal T-cell-mediated barrier immunity and uncontrolled antibody responses.

We identify Gp15 as the PSA RBP and construct a synthetic phage library featuring sequence-randomized RBPs, from which host range mutants are isolated and subsequently integrated into a synthetic, polyvalent phage with extended host range. To enable rational design of chimeric RBPs, we determine the crystal structure of the Gp15 receptor-binding carboxyl terminus at 1.7-Å resolution and employ bioinformatics to identify compatible, prophage-encoded RBPs targeting different Listeria serovars. Structure-guided design enables exchange of heterologous RBP head, neck, or shoulder domains to generate chimeric phages with predictable and extended host ranges.

The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease concept provides potential underlying mechanisms for such associations, including intrauterine exposure to endogenous hormones (androgens and estrogens), insulin-like growth factors, etc. However, there is conflicting evidence on the association between birth parameters and the cancer mortality risk. Therefore, we aimed to review and analyse the available data on the association linking birth weight and birth length with cancer mortality. Eleven studies were identified, published until April 2019. A significant association between birth weight and the prognosis of cancer (overall) was found (relative risk, RR 1.06, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.01, 1.11), with low heterogeneity (I2 = 27.7%). In addition, higher birth weight was associated with poorer prognosis of prostate cancer (RR 1.21, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.44). However, the association of birth weight with breast cancer mortality risk in women was not significant (RR 1.16, 95% CI: 0.93, 1.44), which might be due to high statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 67.9%). Birth length was not associated with cancer mortality risk (RR 1.0, 95% CI: 0.90-1.11). It might be inferred that birth parameters are not associated with cancer mortality as strongly as with the risk of developing cancer. Also, the association between birth parameters and cancer mortality risk is not uniform and varies according to its subtypes, and study characteristics/design.

In this review, we summarize basic science and clinical research examining the protective properties of milk sphingomyelin (SM) against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. Dietary SM dose-dependently reduces the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, triglycerides, and fatty acids in cell culture and rodent studies. Overall, rodent feeding studies show dietary milk SM, milk polar lipid mixtures, and milk fat globule membrane reduce serum and hepatic lipid concentrations. Furthermore, these hypolipidemic effects are observed in some supplementation studies in humans, although the extent of reductions in serum cholesterol is typically smaller and only one trial was conducted with purified SM. Dietary milk SM has been reported to affect the gut  in rodent studies and its hydrolytic product, sphingosine, displays bactericidal activity in vitro. Milk SM may also improve gut barrier function to prevent the translocation of inflammatory gut bacteria-derived molecules. Current evidence from pre-clinical studies indicates that dietary milk SM has protective properties against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. The hypolipidemic effects of milk SM observed in animal studies have been reported in some human studies, although the magnitude of such effects is typically smaller.

Weaning is a time of significant stress, dietary changes, microbial alterations, and a predisposition to infection. The loss of animal health and growth makes potential microbial interventions of interest to the swine industry. Recent studies have demonstrated the diversity and development of the  in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of piglets during weaning, resulting from the dietary and physiological changes. Despite these advances, the role of the mycobiota in piglet health and its contribution to overall  development remains mostly unknown. In this study we investigated the bacteriome and the mycobiome after weaning in the GI tract organs and feces from 35-day old piglets. Following weaning, the α-diversity and amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) counts of the bacteriome increased, proximally to distally, from the stomach to the feces along the GI tract, while the mycobiome α-diversity and ASV counts were highest in the porcine stomach. β-diversity analyses show distinct clusters based on organ type in the bacteriome and mycobiome, but dispersion remained relatively constant in the mycobiome between organ/fecal sites. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Epsilonbacteraeota were the most abundant bacterial phyla present in the GI tract and feces based on mean taxonomic composition with high variation of composition found in the stomach. In the mycobiome, the dominant phyla were Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, and the stomach mycobiome did not demonstrate the same high level of variation observed in the bacteriome. Potential interactions between genera were found in the lower piglet GI bacteriome and mycobiome with positive correlations found between the fungus, , and several bacterial species, including .  demonstrated negative correlations with the short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria , , and . This study demonstrates the distinct colonization dynamics between fungi and bacteria in the GI tract and feces of piglets directly following weaning and the potential interactions of these microbes in the porcine gut ecosystem.Copyright © 2019 Arfken, Frey, Ramsay and Summers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658936>The Role of  in Preventing Multidrug-Resistant Bacterial Infections.</a></h2><p>The introduction of industrially produced antibiotics was a milestone in the history of medicine. Now, almost a century later, the adverse consequences of these highly effective drugs have become evident in the form of antibiotic-resistant infections, which are on the rise around the world. The search for solutions to this problem has involved both the introduction of newer types of antibiotics and, increasingly, the development of alternative strategies to prevent infections due to multidrug-resistant bacteria. In this article, we review the pathophysiological connection between the use of antibiotics and the occurrence of such infections. We also discuss some alternative strategies that are currently under development.This review is based on pertinent articles that appeared from January 2000 to April 2019 and were retrieved by a selective search in the PubMed database employing the search term "( OR ) AND infection." Further suggestions by our author team regarding relevant literature were considered as well.The spectrum of preventive strategies encompasses measures for the protection of the intestinal  (antimicrobial stewardship, neutralization of antibiotic residues in the bowel, use of phages and species-specific antibiotics) as well as measures for its reconstitution (prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal  transfer).In view of the major problem that multidrug-resistant bacteria pose for the world's population and the resources now being spent on the search for a solution, derived both from public funding and from the pharmaceutical industry, we hope to see new, clinically useful approaches being developed and implemented in the near future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659751>Nutraceuticals as Modulators of Gut : Role in Therapy.</a></h2><p>As our knowledge of the various roles of the gut  in the maintenance of homeostasis grows and as we learn how a disrupted  may contribute to disease, therapeutic strategies that target our microbial fellow-travelers become ever more attractive. Most appealing are those interventions that seek to modify or supplement our diet through the addition of nutraceuticals. We now know that our diet, whether in the short- or long-term, is a major modifier of  composition and function. Of the various nutraceuticals, two categories; prebiotics and probiotics have received the greatest attention in basic research and product development. While our understanding of the impacts of prebiotics and probiotics on the indigenous  and host biology have been described in great detail in vitro and inanimal models, the clinical literature leaves much to be desired. While many claims have been made, few are supported by high quality clinical trials.This article is protected by copyright.

Vitamin D and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are environmental factors that are associated by several pathways, including changes to the gastrointestinal , with the development and course of IBD. : This review explores the interaction of vitamin D, and UVR, with the intestinal innate and adaptive immune systems, and how they may influence the gut  and the subsequent development, and progression, of IBD. : Vitamin D and UVR both regulate innate and adaptive immunity through a combination of common and independent mechanisms, with the overall effect being the promotion of immune tolerance. Vitamin D, and to a lesser extent UVR, can modify the gastrointestinal  either directly, or through immune-mediated mechanisms and this may explain the effect on intestinal inflammation in animal models of IBD and some clinical studies. Thus, both vitamin D and UVR exposure can be considered potential "master regulators" of gastrointestinal immunity, fine-tuning the complex interaction between genetics, host immunity and the gut . Further research and increased understanding of environment-host interactions is essential to achieving the ultimate goal of preventing and curing IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663195>Natural compulsive-like behaviour in the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii) is associated with altered gut  composition.</a></h2><p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric illness that significantly impacts affected patients, and available treatments yield suboptimal therapeutic response. Recently, the role of the gut-brain axis (GBA) in psychiatric illness has emerged as a potential target for therapeutic exploration. However, studies concerning the role of the GBA in OCD are limited. To investigate whether a naturally occurring obsessive-compulsive-like phenotype in a rodent model, i.e. large nest-building in deer mice, is associated with perturbations in the gut , we investigated and characterized the gut  in specific pathogen free bred and housed large (LNB) and normal (NNB) nest building deer mice of both sexes (n = 11 per group, including 3 males and 8 females). Following baseline characterisation of nest building behaviour, a single faecal sample was collected from each animal and the gut  analysed. Our results reveal the overall microbial composition of LNB animals to be distinctly different compared to controls (PERMANOVA p < 0.05). While no genera were found to be significantly differentially abundant after correcting for multiple comparisons, the normal phenotype showed a higher loading of Prevotella and Anaeroplasma, while the OC-phenotype demonstrated a higher loading of Desulfovermiculus, Aestuariispira, Peptococcus and Holdemanella (cut-off threshold for loading at 0.2 in either the first or second component of the PCA). These findings not only provide proof-of-concept for continued investigation of the GBA in OCD, but also highlight a potential underlying etiological association between alterations in the gut  and the natural development of obsessive-compulsive-like behaviours.© 2019 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652348>Nod-like receptors are critical for gut-brain axis signalling in mice.</a></h2><p>Nod-like receptors regulate cognition, anxiety, and HPA-axis activation Nod-like receptors regulate central and peripheral serotonergic biology Nod-like receptors are important for maintenance of GI physiology Intestinal epithelial cell expression of Nod1 receptors regulate behaviour ABSTRACT: Gut-brain axis signalling is critical for maintaining health and homeostasis. Stressful life events can impact gut-brain signalling, leading to altered mood, cognition and intestinal dysfunction. Here we identify nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (Nod)-like receptors (NLR), Nod1 and Nod2, as novel regulators for gut-brain signalling. NLR are innate immune pattern recognition receptors expressed in the gut and brain, important in the regulation of gastrointestinal (GI) physiology. We found that mice deficient in both Nod1 and Nod2 (NodDKO) demonstrate signs of stress-induced anxiety, cognitive impairment and depression in the context of a hyperactive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. These deficits were coupled with impairments in the serotonergic pathway in the brain, decreased hippocampal cell proliferation and immature neurons, as well as reduced neural activation. In addition, NodDKO mice had increased GI permeability and altered serotonin signalling in the gut following exposure to acute stress. Administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, abrogated behavioral impairments and restored serotonin signalling. We also identified that intestinal epithelial cell-specific deletion of Nod1 (VilCre Nod1 ), but not Nod2, increased susceptibility to stress-induced anxiety-like behaviour and cognitive impairment following exposure to stress. Together these data suggest that intestinal epithelial NLR are novel modulators of gut-brain communication and may serve as potential novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of gut-brain disorders.

Thirty-two conventional M. hyopneumoniae free piglets were randomly selected from six different litters at 3 weeks of age and were experimentally inoculated with M. hyopneumoniae at 8 weeks of age. Lung lesion scores (LS) were recorded 4 weeks post-inoculation (12 weeks of age) from piglet lungs at necropsy. Fecal bacterial community composition of piglets at 3, 8 and 12 weeks of age were targeted by amplifying the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The LS ranged from 0.3 to 43% with an evident clustering of the scores observed in piglets within litters. There were significant differences in species richness and alpha diversity in fecal microbiomes among piglets within litters at different time points (p < 0.05). The dissimilarity matrices indicated that at 3 weeks of age, the fecal  of piglets was more dissimilar compared to those from 8 to 12 weeks of age. Specific groups of bacteria in the gut that might predict the decreased severity of M. hyopneumoniae associated lesions were identified. The microbial shift at 3 weeks of age was observed to be driven by the increase in abundance of the indicator family, Ruminococcaceae in piglets with low LS (p < 0.05). The taxa, Ruminococcus_2 having the highest richness scores, correlated significantly between litters showing stronger associations with the lowest LS (r = -0.49, p = 0.005). These findings suggest that early life gut  can be a potential determinant for M. hyopneumoniae susceptibility in pigs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654707>Intra-amniotic administration (Gallus gallus) of TiO, SiO, and ZnO nanoparticles affect brush border membrane functionality and alters gut microflora populations.</a></h2><p>Metal oxide nanoparticles (NP) are increasingly used in the food and agriculture industries, making human consumption nearly unavoidable. The goal of this study was to use the Gallus gallus (broiler chicken) intra-amniotic administration of physiologically relevant concentrations of TiO, SiO, and ZnO to better understand the effects of NP exposure on gut health and function. Immediately after hatch, blood, cecum, and small intestine were collected for assessment of iron (Fe)-metabolism, zinc (Zn)-metabolism, brush border membrane (BBM) functional, and pro-inflammatory related proteins gene expression; blood Fe and Zn levels; cecum weight; and the relative abundance of intestinal microflora. NP type, dose, and the presence or absence of minerals was shown to result in altered mineral transporter, BBM functional, and pro-inflammatory gene expression. Metal oxide NP also altered the abundance of intestinal bacterial populations. Overall, the data suggest that the in vivo results align with in vitro studies, and that NP have the potential to negatively affect intestinal functionality and health.Copyright © 2019.

To study underlying biological mechanisms and factors that influence the intestinal  development, longitudinal data from flocks and individual birds is needed. However, post-mortem collection of samples hampers longitudinal data collection. In this study, invasively collected cecal and ileal content, cloacal swabs collected from the same bird, and boot sock samples and cecal droppings from the litter of the broilers' poultry house, were collected on days 0, 2, 7, 14 and 35 post-hatch. The different sample types were evaluated on their applicability and reliability to characterize the broiler intestinal . The  of 247 samples was assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. Analyses of α and β measures showed a similar development of  composition of cecal droppings compared to cecal content. Furthermore, the composition of cecal content samples was comparable to that of the boot socks until day 14 post-hatch. This study shows that the value of non-invasive sample types varies at different ages and depends on the goal of the  characterization. Specifically, cecal droppings and boot socks may be useful alternatives for cecal samples to determine intestinal  composition longitudinally.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659035>Global imprint of mycorrhizal fungi on whole-plant nutrient economics.</a></h2><p>Mycorrhizal fungi are critical members of the plant , forming a symbiosis with the roots of most plants on Earth. Most plant species partner with either arbuscular or ectomycorrhizal fungi, and these symbioses are thought to represent plant adaptations to fast and slow soil nutrient cycling rates. This generates a second hypothesis, that arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal plant species traits complement and reinforce these fungal strategies, resulting in nutrient acquisitive vs. conservative plant trait profiles. Here we analyzed 17,764 species level trait observations from 2,940 woody plant species to show that mycorrhizal plants differ systematically in nitrogen and phosphorus economic traits. Differences were clearest in temperate latitudes, where ectomycorrhizal plant species are more nitrogen use- and phosphorus use-conservative than arbuscular mycorrhizal species. This difference is reflected in both aboveground and belowground plant traits and is robust to controlling for evolutionary history, nitrogen fixation ability, deciduousness, latitude, and species climate niche. Furthermore, mycorrhizal effects are large and frequently similar to or greater in magnitude than the influence of plant nitrogen fixation ability or deciduous vs. evergreen leaf habit. Ectomycorrhizal plants are also more nitrogen conservative than arbuscular plants in boreal and tropical ecosystems, although differences in phosphorus use are less apparent outside temperate latitudes. Our findings bolster current theories of ecosystems rooted in mycorrhizal ecology and support the hypothesis that plant mycorrhizal association is linked to the evolution of plant nutrient economic strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647551>Host specificity in diatom-bacteria interactions alleviates antagonistic effects.</a></h2><p>While different microalgae tend to be associated with different bacteria, it remains unclear if such specific associations are beneficial for the microalgae. We assessed the impact of bacterial isolates, derived from various marine benthic diatoms, on the growth of several strains belonging to the Cylindrotheca closterium diatom species complex. We first tested the effect of thirty-five different bacterial isolates on the growth of a single C. closterium strain, and then evaluated the impact of eight of these isolates on the growth of six C. closterium strains and one C. fusiformis strain. Surprisingly, most interactions were neutral to antagonistic. The interactions were highly specific, with diatom growth in the presence of specific bacteria differing between Cylindrotheca strains and species, and closely related bacteria eliciting contrasting diatom growth responses. These differences could be related to the origin of the bacterial isolates, as only isolates from foreign diatom hosts significantly reduced diatom growth, implying coadaptation between different Cylindrotheca strains and their associated bacteria. Interestingly, the antagonistic effect of a Marinobacter strain was alleviated by the presence of microbial inocula that was native to the diatom host, suggesting that coadapted bacteria might also benefit their host indirectly by preventing the establishment of harmful bacteria.© FEMS 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652955>An Association of Gut  with Different Phenotypes in Chinese Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.</a></h2><p>We aimed to investigate the association of gut  with disease activity, inflammatory parameters, and auto-antibodies profile in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Two of the four rhinoceros species in human care, Sumatran rhinoceros () and black rhinoceros (), are susceptible, whereas the other two, white rhinoceros () and greater one-horned (GOH) rhinoceros (), are relatively resistant to IOD. Complex interrelationships exist between mammalian hosts, their indigenous gut , metabolome, physical condition, and iron availability. The goal of this study was to gain insight into these relationships within the family Rhinocerotidae. Specific objectives were to (1) characterize the gut  and metabolome of four rhinoceros species; (2) compare the  and metabolome of IOD-susceptible and IOD-resistant rhinoceros species; and (3) identify variation in the  and metabolome associated with compromised health or disease in IOD-susceptible rhinoceroses. Fecal samples were collected from 31 rhinoceroses (Sumatran rhinoceros,  = 3; black rhinoceros,  = 6; GOH rhinoceros,  = 9; white rhinoceros,  = 13) located at five facilities, and matched fecal aliquots were processed for  and metabolome analyses using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. Despite the phylogenetic disparity and dissimilar zoo diets of the hosts, the structure of the fecal  of the two IOD-susceptible rhinoceros species were more closely related to each other than to those of the two IOD-resistant species (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity; IOD-susceptible vs. IOD-resistant -value < 0.001). In addition, IOD-susceptible rhinoceroses exhibited less microbial diversity than their IOD-resistant relatives (Shannon diversity; -value < 0.001) which could have health implications. Of note, the black rhinoceros was distinct among the four rhinoceros species with the most divergent fecal metabolome; interestingly, it contained higher concentrations of short chain fatty acids. Neither age nor sex were associated with differences in microbial community composition ( = 0.253 and 0.488, respectively) or fecal metabolomic profile ( = 0.634 and 0.332, respectively). Differences in the distal gut microbiomes between IOD-resistant and IOD-susceptible rhinoceroses support hypotheses that gut microbes play a role in host iron acquisition, and further studies and experiments to test these hypotheses are warranted.Copyright © 2019 Roth, Switzer, Watanabe-Chailland, Bik, Relman, Romick-Rosendale and Ollberding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650414>Effects of the Probiotic Candidate E. faecalis-1, the Poulvac E. coli Vaccine, and their Combination on Growth Performance, Caecal Microbial Composition, Immune Response, and Protection against E. coli O78 Challenge in Broiler Chickens.</a></h2><p>The present study was performed on 180-day-old commercial Cobb chicks to assess the effects of the probiotic candidate Enterococcus faecalis-1, the Poulvac Escherichia coli vaccine, and their combination on growth parameters, intestinal microbial composition, immune response, and protection against challenge with the avian pathogen E. coli O78.

This study aimed to investigate whether the cattle breed affects specific ruminal taxonomic microbial groups and functions associated with feed conversion ratio (FCR), using two genetically related Angus breeds as a model. Total RNA was extracted from 24 rumen content samples collected from purebred Black and Red Angus bulls fed the same forage diet and then subjected to metatranscriptomic analysis. Multivariate discriminant analysis (sparse partial least square discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA)) and analysis of composition of microbiomes were conducted to identify microbial signatures characterizing Black and Red Angus cattle. Our analyses revealed relationships among bacterial signatures, host breeds and FCR. Although Black and Red Angus are genetically similar, sPLS-DA detected 25 bacterial species and 10 functions that differentiated the rumen microbial signatures between those two breeds. In Black Angus, we identified bacterial taxa Chitinophaga pinensis, Clostridium stercorarium and microbial functions with large and small subunits ribosomal proteins L16 and S7 exhibiting a higher abundance in the rumen . In Red Angus, nonetheless, we identified the poorly characterized bacterial taxon Oscillibacter valericigenes with a higher abundance and pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism. Analysis of composition of microbiomes revealed that C. pinensis and C. stercorarium exhibited a higher abundance in Black Angus compared to Red Angus associated with FCR, suggesting that these bacterial species may play a key role in the feed conversion efficiency of forage-fed bulls. This study highlights how the discovery of signatures of bacterial taxa and their functions can be used to harness the full potential of the rumen  in Angus cattle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655168>Sepsis roadmap: What we know, what we learned, and where we are going.</a></h2><p>Sepsis is a life-threatening condition originating as a result of systemic blood infection causing, one or more organ damage due to the dysregulation of the immune response.

The causative organism, Paenibacillus larvae, attacks honey bee brood and renders entire hives dysfunctional during active disease states, but more commonly resides in hives asymptomatically as inactive spores that elude even vigilant beekeepers. The mechanism of this pathogenic transition is not fully understood, and no cure exists for AFB. Here, we evaluated how hive supplementation with probiotic lactobacilli (delivered through a nutrient patty; BioPatty) affected colony resistance towards a naturally occurring AFB outbreak. Results demonstrated a significantly lower pathogen load and proteolytic activity of honey bee larvae from BioPatty-treated hives. Interestingly, a distinctive shift in the  composition of adult nurse bees occurred irrespective of treatment group during the monitoring period, but only vehicle-supplemented nurse bees exhibited higher P. larvae loads. In vitro experiments utilizing laboratory-reared honey bee larvae showed Lactobacillus plantarum Lp39, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1, and Lactobacillus kunkeei BR-1 (contained in the BioPatty) could reduce pathogen load, upregulate expression of key immune genes, and improve survival during P. larvae infection. These findings suggest the usage of a lactobacilli-containing hive supplement, which is practical and affordable for beekeepers, may be effective for reducing enzootic pathogen-related hive losses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654910>The mycobiota: fungi take their place between plants and bacteria.</a></h2><p>Eukaryotes host numerous intracellular and associated microbes in their .

In contrast, Streptococcus and Campylobacter were the most abundant genera in HC with a mean relative abundance of 63% and 2%, respectively. The microbiological network indicated that most of the bacteria that were enriched at greater levels in CG patients were likely to be Prevotella, Actinomyces, and Rothia. These have been shown to co-exist with other bacteria.The composition and structure of bacterial communities in CG patients were different from HC. Most of the genera observed in CG patients were associated with periodontitis and pulp infection. These findings might be helpful in understanding the etiology of CG.

Recent studies provided strong evidence that autophagy plays a key role in the etiology of Crohn's disease (CD). Probiotics may exhibit many therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory abilities. While successful results have been obtained in ulcerative colitis patients, probiotics remain inefficient in CD for unknown reason. It remains therefore important to better understand their molecular mechanisms of action.The activation of autophagy was examined by stimulating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by the bacteria, followed by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis. The impact of blocking in vitro autophagy was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using 3-methyl adenine or bafilomycin followed by cytokine secretion measurement by ELISA. The role of autophagy in the anti-inflammatory capacities of the bacterial strains was evaluated in vivo using an acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced murine model of colitis. The impact of BMDC was evaluated by adoptive transfer, notably using bone marrow cells derived from autophagy-related 16-like 1-deficient mice.We showed that selected lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are able to induce autophagy activation in BMDCs. Blocking in vitro autophagy abolished the capacity of the strains to induce the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, while it exacerbated the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β. We confirmed in the TNBS-induced mouse model of colitis that autophagy is involved in the protective capacity of these selected strains, and showed that dendritic cells are involved in this process.We propose autophagy as a novel mechanism involved in the regulatory capacities of probiotics.© Copyright by the Author(s).

Trophic interactions may be altered through climate-dependent changes in either predator food preferences or prey communities. Yet, climate change impacts on predator diet remain surprisingly poorly understood. We experimentally studied the consequences of 2°C warmer climatic conditions on the trophic niche of a generalist lizard predator. We used a system of semi-natural mesocosms housing a variety of invertebrate species and in which climatic conditions were manipulated. Lizards in warmer climatic conditions ate at a greater predatory to phytophagous invertebrate ratio and had smaller individual dietary breadths. These shifts mainly arose from direct impacts of climate on lizard diets rather than from changes in prey communities. Dietary changes were associated with negative changes in fitness-related traits (body condition, gut ) and survival. We demonstrate that climate change alters trophic interactions through top-predator dietary shifts, which might disrupt eco-evolutionary dynamics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650828>A new histological method to study oral soft tissue penetrability to iodine and optimize oral use of iodine solutions.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648732>Medical management, prevention and mitigation of environmental risks factors in Neurology.</a></h2><p>The human environment and exposures arising therefrom are major contributors to neurological disorders ranging from stroke to neurodegenerative diseases.

About half of patients with IBD develop rheumatic ailments and microscopic intestinal inflammation is present in up to half of CRD patients. IBD and CRD patients also share a common therapeutic armamentarium. Disequilibrium in the complex realm of microbes (known as dysbiosis) that closely interact with the gut mucosal immune system has been associated with both IBD and CRD (spondyloarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis). Whether dysbiosis represents an epiphenomenon or a prodromal feature remains to be determined.In an attempt to further investigate whether specific gut dysbiosis may be the missing link between IBD and CRD in patients developing both diseases, we performed here a systematic literature review focusing on studies looking at bacterial  in CRD and/or IBD patients.We included 80 studies, with a total of 3799 IBD patients without arthritis, 1084 CRD patients without IBD, 132 IBD patients with arthropathy manifestations and 12 spondyloarthritis patients with IBD history. Overall, this systematic review indicates that an increase in s,  and  genera, as well as a decrease in  genera and species belonging to Verrucomicrobia and Fusobacteria phyla are common features in IBD and CRD patients, whereas dozens of bacterial species are specific features of CRD and IBD.Further work is needed to understand the functions of bacteria and of their metabolites but also to characterize fungi and viruses that are commonly found in these patients.© Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653850>Intestinal  composition and its relation to joint pain and inflammation.</a></h2><p>Macrophage-mediated inflammation is thought to have a causal role in osteoarthritis-related pain and severity, and has been suggested to be triggered by endotoxins produced by the gastrointestinal .

Among biotic stressors, root parasitic weeds (RPWs), mainly of the genera Orobanche, Phelipanche and Striga, are major yield-limiting factors of a wide range of staple crops, particularly in developing countries. Here, we provide a conceptual synthesis of putative mechanisms by which soil and plant microbiomes could be harnessed to control RPWs. These mechanisms are partitioned in direct and indirect modes of action and discussed in the context of past and present studies on microbe-mediated suppression of RPWs. Specific emphasis is given to the large but yet unexplored potential of root-associated microorganisms to interfere with the chemical signalling cascade between the host plant and the RPWs.

Bioaugmentation has been proposed for the biodegradation of TCC and its dechlorinated congeners 4,4'-dichlorocarbanilide (DCC) and carbanilide (NCC) in soil. The isolated TCC-degrading strain Ochrobactrum sp. TCC-2 and chloroanilines-degrading strain Diaphorobacter sp. LD72 were used to study the removal efficiency of TCC, DCC and NCC mixture and their chloroanilines intermediates, respectively. The potential degradation competition between TCC and its dechlorinated congeners, and the response of bacterial community during the bioremediation were also investigated. The biodegradation of DCC and TCC was significantly enhanced for soil with inoculums compared with sterilized and natural soils. Chloroanilines products could also be effectively removed. For the degradation of combined substrates in the aqueous medium, NCC had negative effect on the degradation of TCC and DCC, while TCC and DCC negatively influenced each other. The bioaugmentation with two degraders obviously changed the phylogenetic composition and function of indigenous soil . Importantly, the inoculated degraders could be maintained, suggesting their adaptability and potential application in bioaugmentation for such recalcitrant contaminants. This study offers new insights into the enhanced bioremediation of TCC and its dechlorinated congeners contaminated soils by the bioaugmentation of functional degraders and the structure and function response of the indigenous soil  to the bioremediation process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Several sample types have been used to investigate the lung , each presenting specific challenges for preparation and analysis of microbial communities. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) enables the identification of  specific to the lower lung but commonly has low bacterial density, increasing the risk of false-positive signal from contaminating DNA. The objectives of this study were to investigate the extent of contamination across a range of sample densities representative of BALF and identify features of contaminants that facilitate their removal from sequence data and aid in the interpretation of BALF sample 16S sequencing data.Using three mock communities across a range of densities ranging from 8E+ 02 to 8E+ 09 16S copies/ml, we assessed taxonomic accuracy and precision by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the proportion of reads arising from contaminants. Sequencing accuracy, precision, and the relative abundance of mock community members decreased with sample input density, with a significant drop-off below 8E+ 05 16S copies/ml. Contaminant OTUs were commonly inversely correlated with sample input density or not reproduced between technical replicates. Removal of taxa with these features or physical concentration of samples prior to sequencing improved both sequencing accuracy and precision for samples between 8E+ 04 and 8E+ 06 16S copies/ml. For the lowest densities, below 8E+ 03 16S copies/ml BALF, accuracy and precision could not be significantly improved using these approaches. Using clinical BALF samples across a large density range, we observed that OTUs with features of contaminants identified in mock communities were also evident in low-density BALF samples.Relative abundance data and community composition generated by 16S sequencing of BALF samples across the range of density commonly observed in this sample type should be interpreted in the context of input sample density and may be improved by simple pre- and post-sequencing steps for densities above 8E+ 04 16S copies/ml.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652153>Exercise and lifestyle changes in pediatric asthma.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this review is to discuss the most recent studies on lifestyle interventions in pediatric asthma.

Existing evidence supports recommending higher intake of fruits and vegetables for asthma risk and control.

However, our understanding of the changes induced by TP on MO challenged layers performances and oxidative status, and on the , remains limited. The aim of the present study was to better understand host (performances and redox balance) and  responses in MO-challenged layers with dietary TP. In this study, 200 Lohmann laying hens (65-week-old) were randomly allocated in a 2 × 2 factorial design to receive a diet with or without MO (0 or 100 mg/kg), and supplemented with either 0 or 600 mg/kg TP. The results indicate that 100 mg/kg MO decreased egg production ( = 0.03), while dietary TP increased egg production in MO challenged layers ( < 0.01). Egg yolk color was decreased by high MO ( < 0.01), while dietary TP had no effect on yolk color ( > 0.05). Serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and malonaldehyde (MDA) concentration were increased by high MO, while total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), xanthine oxidase (XOD) activity, glutathione s-transferase (GSH-ST), and glutathione concentration in serum were decreased ( < 0.05). Dietary TP was able to reverse the increasing effect of MO on ALT and AST ( < 0.05). High MO resulted in higher MO levels in serum, liver, kidney, and egg, but it decreased Cu and Se content in serum, liver, and egg ( < 0.05). The Fe concentration in liver, kidney, and eggs was significantly lower in MO supplementation groups ( < 0.05). High MO levels in the diet led to lower  and higher  abundance, whereas dietary TP alone and/or in high MO treatment increased the  abundance and the  ratio at phylum level. High MO increased the abundance of  (phylum),  (class),  (order), and  (family), whereas dietary TP promoted the enrichment of  (species).

All subjects were genotyped using the Illumina CoreExome SNP microarray.Previous reports of gut dysbiosis in AS were reconfirmed and several notable bacterial species and functional categories were differentially abundant. TNFi therapy was correlated with a restoration the perturbed  observed in untreated AS cases to that of healthy controls, including several important bacterial species that have been previously associated with AS and other related diseases. Enrichment of bacterial peptides homologous to HLA-B27-presented epitopes was observed in the stools of patients with AS, suggesting that either HLA-B27 fails to clear these or that they are involved in driving HLA-B27-associated immune reactions. TNFi therapy largely restored the perturbed  observed in untreated AS cases to that of healthy controls, including several important bacterial species that have been previously associated with AS and other related diseases. TNFi therapy of patients with AS was also associated with a reduction of potentially arthritogenic bacterial peptides, relative to untreated patients.These findings emphasise the key role that the gut  plays in driving the pathogenesis of AS and highlight potential therapeutic and/or preventative targets.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

However, chronic TMP use drives development of antibiotic resistance (increasing likelihood of subsequent infections) and disrupts the gut  (linked to autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases), tempering translational excitement of this approach in model systems and for treating human diseases. Herein, we identified a TMP-based, non-antibiotic small molecule, termed 14a (MCC8529), and tested its ability to control multiple DHFR-based reporters and signaling proteins. We found that 14a is non-toxic and can effectively stabilize DHFR DDs expressed in mammalian cells. Furthermore, 14a crosses the blood-retinal barrier and stabilizes DHFR DDs expressed in the mouse eye with kinetics comparable to that of TMP (≤6 h). Surprisingly, 14a stabilized a DHFR DD in the liver significantly better than TMP did, while having no effect on the mouse gut . Our results suggest that alternative small-molecule DHFR DD stabilizers (such as 14a) may be ideal substitutes for TMP in instances when conditional, non-antibiotic control of protein abundance is desired in the eye and beyond.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659215>Metabolism of the predominant human milk oligosaccharide fucosyllactose by an infant gut commensal.</a></h2><p>A number of bifidobacterial species are found at a particularly high prevalence and abundance in faecal samples of healthy breastfed infants, a phenomenon that is believed to be, at least partially, due to the ability of bifidobacteria to metabolize Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs).

These microbial communities and their associated genes - collectively termed the root  - are diverse and have been shown to play an important role in conferring abiotic stress tolerance to their plant hosts. In light of growing concerns over the threat of water and nutrient stress facing terrestrial ecosystems, especially those used for agricultural production, increased emphasis has been placed on understanding how abiotic stress conditions influence the composition and functioning of the root  and the ultimate consequences for plant health. However, the composition of the root  under abiotic stress conditions will not only reflect shifts in the greater bulk soil microbial community from which plants recruit their root  but also plant responses to abiotic stress, which include changes in root exudate profiles and morphology. Exploring the relative contributions of these direct and plant-mediated effects on the root  has been the focus of many studies in recent years.

Here, we show that the development of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells relies on a specific temporal window, after which MAIT cell development is permanently impaired. This imprinting depends on early-life exposure to defined microbes that synthesize riboflavin-derived antigens. In adults, cutaneous MAIT cells are a dominant population of interleukin-17A (IL-17A)-producing lymphocytes, which display a distinct transcriptional signature and can subsequently respond to skin commensals in an IL-1-, IL-18-, and antigen-dependent manner.

In this study, the ability of  heteropolysaccharide (GFP) to ameliorate NAFLD was investigated in rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD). The molecular mechanisms modulating the expression of specific gene members related to lipid synthesis and conversion, cholesterol metabolism, and inflammation pathways were determined. The components of the intestinal microflora in rats were analyzed by high-throughput next-generation 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Supplementation with GFP significantly increased the proportions of , , and  and decreased the proportions of , , , , and . In addition, , , and  were shown to be significant cecal  according to the Spearman's correlation test between the gut  and biomedical assays (|r| > 0.7). Histological analysis and biomedical assays showed that GFP treatments could significantly protect against NAFLD. In addition, ,  and  may play vital roles in the prevention of NAFLD. These results suggest that GFP could be used as a functional material to regulate the gut  of NAFLD individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649628>Microcins in : Peptide Antimicrobials in the Eco-Active Intestinal Chemosphere.</a></h2><p>Microcins are low-molecular-weight, ribosomally produced, highly stable, bacterial-inhibitory molecules involved in competitive, and amensalistic interactions between  in the intestine. These interactions take place in a highly complex chemical landscape, the intestinal eco-active chemosphere, composed of chemical substances that positively or negatively influence bacterial growth, including those originated from nutrient uptake, and those produced by the action of the human or animal host and the intestinal . The contribution of bacteria results from their effect on the host generated molecules, on food and digested food, and organic substances from microbial origin, including from bacterial degradation. Here, we comprehensively review the main chemical substances present in the human intestinal chemosphere, particularly of those having inhibitory effects on microorganisms. With this background, and focusing on , the most relevant human pathogens from the intestinal , the microcin's history and classification, mechanisms of action, and mechanisms involved in microcin's immunity (in microcin producers) and resistance (non-producers) are reviewed. Products from the chemosphere likely modulate the ecological effects of microcin activity. Several cross-resistance mechanisms are shared by microcins, colicins, bacteriophages, and some conventional antibiotics, which are expected to produce cross-effects. Double-microcin-producing strains (such as microcins MccM and MccH47) have been successfully used for decades in the control of pathogenic gut organisms. Microcins are associated with successful gut colonization, facilitating translocation and invasion, leading to bacteremia, and urinary tract infections. In fact,  strains from the more invasive phylogroups (e.g., B2) are frequently microcinogenic. A publicly accessible APD3 database http://aps.unmc.edu/AP/ shows particular genes encoding microcins in 34.1% of .  strains (mostly MccV, MccM, MccH47, and MccI47), and much less in  and  (<2%). Some 4.65% of  are microcinogenic (mostly with MccE492), and even less in  or  (mostly MccS). The high frequency and variety of microcins in some  indicate key ecological functions, a notion supported by their dominance in the intestinal  of biosynthetic gene clusters involved in the synthesis of post-translationally modified peptide microcins.Copyright © 2019 Baquero, Lanza, Baquero, del Campo and Bravo-Vázquez.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649629>Similar Shift Patterns in Gut Bacterial and Fungal Communities Across the Life Stages of  Larvae From Two Field Populations.</a></h2><p> (Enderlein) (Diptera: Tephritidae) is an oligophagous insect pest that damages citrus fruit, especially in China. Due to larvae living within a highly septic environment, a wide variety of microorganisms exist in the larval gut of . However, a systematic study of the intestinal  of this harmful insect pest is still lacking. Here, we comprehensively investigated the larval gut  of  in two field populations from Zigui (developed in orange) and Danjiangkou (developed in mandarin orange). We observed a dominance of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes in these bacterial communities, and Enterobacteriaceae was the predominant family throughout the larval stage. However, most of the identified fungal sequences were annotated as being from either Ascomycota or Basidiomycota phyla. Although there was a difference in the structure of the microbial communities between the two populations, the dynamic change patterns of most of the members of the  were similar across the lifespan of larvae in both populations. The relative abundances of the Acetobacteraceae, Leuconostocaceae, and Lactobacillaceae gut bacteria as well as the Pichiaceae, Sebacinaceae, and Amanitaceae fungi increased throughout development, and these microorganisms stably resided in the larval gut. Furthermore, the dynamic changes of the functions of gut bacterial communities were inferred, and there was a significant increase in carbohydrate metabolism across the lifespan of larvae in both groups. Spearman correlation analysis showed that Acetobacteraceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Leuconostocaceae displayed a positive correlation with fructose and mannose metabolism, an important pathway of carbohydrate metabolism, highlighting the potential roles of these prevalent microbial communities in host biology.Copyright © 2019 Yao, Ma, Cai, Raza, Bai, Wang, Zhang, Ma and Zhang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654650>Dysfunctional  with reduced capacity to produce butyrate as a basis for allergic diseases.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650344>The  of Codium tomentosum: original state and in the presence of copper.</a></h2><p>Codium tomentosum, as all organisms, hosts transiently and permanently numerous microorganisms.

Network meta-analysis (NWM) has been established as an evidence-synthesis tool that incorporates direct and indirect evidence in a collection of randomized controlled trials. So far no NWM exists concerning therapeutic interventions for recurrent CDI (rCDI).In this NWM we assessed the comparative effectiveness of various therapies for rCDI to examine the efficacy rank order and determine the optimum therapeutic approach.A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to investigate the efficacy rank order of rCDI interventions.Six eligible RCTs were entered into an NWM. They included 348 rCDI patients, in whom seven therapeutic interventions were used, i.e. donor fecal  transplantation (DFMT), vancomycin, fidaxomicin, vancomycin + DFMT, vancomycin + bowel lavage, autologous FMT and placebo. DFMT showed the highest efficacy in comparison with vancomycin [odds ratio (95% credible interval), 20.02 (7.05-70.03)] and fidaxomicin (22.01 (4.38-109.63)).This NWM showed that DFMT is the optimum therapeutic approach for rCDI, as it was the most efficacious among various therapeutic interventions, particularly in comparison with commonly used antibiotics such as vancomycin or fidaxomicin.© Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662889>Effect of a Glyphosate-Containing Herbicide on  and Salmonella Ser.

Many studies in the past have shown that residues of the herbicide can be found in many cultivated plants, including those used as livestock feed. Sensitivity to glyphosate varies with bacteria, particularly those residing in the intestine, where  is exposed to glyphosate residues. Therefore, less susceptible pathogenic isolates could have a distinct advantage compared to more sensitive commensal isolates, probably leading to dysbiosis. To determine whether the ruminal growth and survival of pathogenic  or  serovar Typhimurium are higher when glyphosate residues are present in the feed, an  fermentation trial with a "Rumen Simulation System" (RUSITEC) and a glyphosate-containing commercial formulation was performed. Colony forming units of  and  ser. Typhimurium decreased steadily in all fermenters, regardless of the herbicide application. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of the studied  and  strains did not change, and antibiotic susceptibility varied only slightly but independent of the glyphosate application.

A multicenter case-control study was performed in The Netherlands to elucidate the clinical relevance of molecular diagnostics results in gastroenteritis (GE). Samples from this case-control study were used to perform a detailed analysis on the presence of D. fragilis and Blastocystis in relation to gastrointestinal symptoms. In the present study, a real-time PCR for Blastocystis was performed on 1374 case samples and 1026 control samples from the multicenter gastroenteritis case-control study previously tested for D. fragilis. Prevalence of both micro-organisms was highest in children under 20 years of age and lowest in the oldest age group. A significantly lower overall detection of D. fragilis and Blastocystis was found in cases (both 25.8%) as compared to controls (37.6% and 40.0%, respectively). The difference for D. fragilis was statistically significant for subjects above 20 years of age. For Blastocystis, the difference was statistically significant in all age groups, except in children less than 5 years of age. A negative relation between D. fragilis-positive cases and diarrhea was found in this study population. More GE symptoms were reported in cases without D. fragilis or Blastocystis. In the present study, prevalence of both D. fragilis and Blastocystis is lower in cases with gastroenteritic symptoms than in controls. Besides, in cases with D. fragilis or Blastocystis, no association is shown between any of the GE symptoms.

Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) reduces cholesterol via its conversion into bile acids (BAs). During RCT in non-hepatic peripheral tissues, cholesterol is transferred to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and returned to the liver for conversion into BAs predominantly via the rate-limiting enzyme, cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). Numerous reports have described that polyphenol induced increases in BA excretion and corresponding reductions in total and LDL cholesterol in animal and in-vitro studies, but the process whereby this occurs has not been extensively reviewed. There are three main mechanisms by which BA excretion can be augmented: (1) increased expression of CYP7A1; (2) reduced expression of intestinal BA transporters; and (3) changes in the gut . Here we summarise the BA metabolic pathways focusing on CYP7A1, how its gene is regulated via transcription factors, diurnal rhythms, and microRNAs. Importantly, we will address the following questions: (1) Can polyphenols enhance BA secretion by modulating the CYP7A1 biosynthetic pathway? (2) Can polyphenols alter the BA pool via changes in the gut ? (3) Which polyphenols are the most promising candidates for future research? We conclude that while in rodents some polyphenols induce CYP7A1 expression predominantly by the LXRα pathway, in human cells, this may occur through FXR, NF-KB, and ERK signalling. Additionally, gut  is important for the de-conjugation and excretion of BAs. Puerarin, resveratrol, and quercetin are promising candidates for further research in this area.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660354>Corrigendum: The Role of Fecal  Transplantation in Reducing Intestinal Colonization With Antibiotic-Resistant Organisms: The Current Landscape and Future Directions.</a></h2><p>[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1093/ofid/ofz288.][This corrects the article DOI: 10.1093/ofid/ofz288.].© The Author(s) 2019.

In healthy individuals, gut commensal fungi act synergistically with other members of the  to maintain homeostasis but their role in IBD is less clear.To review the role of gut fungi and their trans-kingdom interactions with bacteria in IBD METHODS: A literature search was conducted on Ovid and Pubmed to select relevant animal and human studies that have reported fungi and IBD.There is an increased total fungal load particularly of Candida and Malassezia species in the faeces and mucosa of Crohn's disease patients, and a lower fungal diversity in the faeces of ulcerative colitis patients. Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein (CARD)-9 polymorphism in Crohn's disease patients favours Malassezia colonisation that worsens gut inflammation. Diet high in carbohydrates increased the total abundance of Candida species, whereas protein-rich diet had the opposite effect. Anti-fungal therapies are mostly used to treat Candida albicans or Histoplasma capsulatum infections in IBD, whereas pilot studies of supplementing fungal probiotics Saccharomycopsis fibuligera, Saccharomyces boulardii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 strain showed therapeutic effects in IBD.Gut fungi are altered in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

Remarkably, despite its potentially protective effect, the level of antimicrobial activity in the investigated sputa correlated inversely with patient outcome, most likely because disease severity outweighed the beneficial antimicrobial activities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662387>Effects of a probiotic treatment () and open-label placebo on symptoms of allergic rhinitis: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Several studies suggest that gut  may play an important role in allergic diseases. The present trial aims to examine effects of the probiotic  on symptoms of allergic rhinitis in patients. Effects of this probiotic on the immune system have been reported by several studies, but the majority of the previous trials were animal studies. In addition, it is well known that symptoms in allergic rhinitis are prone to exhibit high placebo responses. Moreover, recent studies report that even placebos without deception (open-label placebos) are highly effective in reducing symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Our study design combines both new approaches to assess effects on allergic symptoms in patients. The objective of this study is to compare the effects of a probiotic treatment () with effects seen by open-label placebo, concealed placebo treatment and no treatment control.A total of 120 patients with allergic rhinitis will be randomly assigned to one of four different groups: a double-blind probiotic/placebo group (groups 1 and 2), an open-label placebo group (group 3) and a no-treatment group (group 4) to control for spontaneous variation of symptoms.

BZTLF is potentially effective against diabetic vascular complications.Previous studies failed to clarify the molecular mechanism through which BZTLF suppressed diabetic ischemia. In this study, we aimed to explore whether BZTLF treatment could prevent the occurrence of type 2 diabetic (T2D) hindlimb ischemia in mice. Further, we investigated the regulatory effect of BZTLF on angiogenesis-related VEGF signaling pathway and gut  dysfunction in diabetic ischemia mice.C57BL/6J mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD) received STZ injection and femoral artery ligation to build T2D diabetic hindlimb ischemia model. Mice were gavaged with BZTLF (5 g [raw materials]/kg/d) or with metformin plus atorvastatin for three weeks. Laser doppler imaging system was utilized for the visualization of blood flow. Histochemistry analysis was performed for microvascular vessel staining. Western blot was applied to detect the protein changes of signaling molecules responsible for VEGF pathway. Finally, 16S rDNA gene sequencing was conducted for analysis of gut  structure.BZTLF treatment remarkably restored blood flow and capillary density of diabetic hindlimb ischemia. And the protein changes of VEGF signaling molecules were reversed in BZTLF-treated diabetic ischemia mice, including the decreased VEGF and HIF-1α, and the increased NO, eNOS and p-ERK1/2. The gut  analysis suggests that BZTLF treatment increased the abundances of several beneficial bacteria (Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides), while decreased the populations of some harmful bacterial (Blautia, Weissella, Escherichia Shigella and Kurthia). By using Spearman correlation analysis, these changed gut flora were positively/negatively correlated with VEGF signaling pathway or glycometabolic parameters.BZTLF displayed beneficial effects on diabetic hindlimb ischemia by reshaping the gut  structure and stunning the VEGF/HIF-1α pathway.Copyright © 2019.

Stool was collected from donor and recipient pre-FMT and longitudinally post-FMT for up to 24 weeks. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed. Reads were analyzed using PathoScope 2.0.All children had resolution of CDI. AMR genes decreased post-FMT ( < .001), with a sustained decrease in multidrug resistance genes ( < .001). Tetracycline resistance genes increased post-FMT ( < .001). Very low levels of potential pathogens were identified in donors and recipients, with an overall decrease post-FMT ( < .001).  sp. 109 expanded in all recipients post-FMT, and no recipients had any clinical infection. Alpha diversity was lower in recipients vs donors pre-FMT ( < .001), with an increase post-FMT ( ≤ .002) that was sustained. Beta diversity differed significantly in pre- vs post-FMT recipient samples ( < .001). Bacterial species  and  showed higher abundance in donors than recipients ( = .008 and  = .040, respectively), with expansion post-FMT. Biosynthetic pathways predominated in the donor and increased in the recipient post-FMT.FMT for CDI in children decreases AMR genes and potential pathogens and changes  composition and function. However, acquisition of certain AMR genes post-FMT combined with low levels of potential pathogens found in donors suggests that further study is warranted regarding screening donors using metagenomics sequencing before FMT.© The Author(s) 2019.

From the biological and botanical perspectives, the interaction between microorganisms and perennial woody plants falls within the category of stable relationships from which the plants can benefit in multiple ways. The life cycle of the host ensures persistence in all seasons, repeated chances of contact, and consequent  accumulation over time, leading to potentially high diversity compared with that of herbaceous short-lived plants. Furthermore, grapevines are agriculturally exploited, highly selected germplasms where a profound man-driven footprint has indirectly and unconsciously shaped the inner  through centuries of cultivation and breeding. Moreover, since endophyte metabolism can contribute to that of the plant host and its fruits' biochemical composition, the nature of grapevine endophytic taxa identities, ecological attitudes, potential toxicity, and clinical relevance are aspects worthy of a thorough investigation. Can endophytic taxa efficiently defend grapevines by acting against pests or confer enough fitness to the plants to endure attacks? What are the underlying mechanisms that translate into this or other advantages in the hosting plant? Can endophytes partially redirect plant metabolism, and to what extent do they act by releasing active products? Is the inner microbial colonization necessary priming for a cascade of actions? Are there defined environmental conditions that can trigger the unleashing of key microbial phenotypes? What is the environmental role in providing the ground biodiversity by which the plant can recruit microsymbionts? How much and by what practices and strategies can these symbioses be managed, applied, and directed to achieve the goal of a better sustainable viticulture? By thoroughly reviewing the available literature in the field and critically examining the data and perspectives, the above issues are discussed.Copyright © 2019 Pacifico, Squartini, Crucitti, Barizza, Lo Schiavo, Muresu, Carimi and Zottini.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652871>The Effect of a Commercially Available Bacteriophage and Bacteriocin on  in Coleslaw.</a></h2><p>Changing consumer attitudes show an increased interest in non-chemical antimicrobials in food preservation and safety. This greater interest of consumers in more 'natural' or 'clean-label' food interventions is complicated by concurrent demands for minimally processed, ready-to-eat (RTE) foods with long shelf lives. Two viable interventions are bacteriophage (phage) and bacteriocins, a number of which have already been approved for use in food safety. Listeriosis is a serious foodborne infection which affects at-risk members of the population. Listeriosis incidence has increased between 2008 and 2015 and has a case fatality rate of up to 20% with antibiotic intervention. Here, we tested an intervention to attempt to control a pathogenic  strain in a food model using two of these alternative antimicrobials. Phage P100 on its own had a significant effect on  ScottA numbers in coleslaw over a 10-day period at 4 °C ( ≤ 0.001). A combination of P100 and Nisaplin (a commercial formulation of the lantibiotic bacteriocin, nisin) had a significant effect on the pathogen ( ≤ 0.001).

Beta-glucan or quercetin in a diet can alleviate colorectal cancer (CRC) by regulating the gut  and related genes, but the effects of alternating their consumption for routine ingestion during CRC occurrence remain unknown. This study investigated the effects of alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin for routine ingestion on CRC development in mice. The mortality rate, colonic length, inflammatory cytokines, gut , and colonic epithelial gene expression in healthy and CRC mice that consumed normal and alternate diets were compared and studied. The results showed that alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin (alternating among a β-glucan diet, a normal diet and a normal diet that was supplemented with quercetin) alleviated colon damage and reduced the mortality rate in CRC mice, with a reduction in mortality of 12.5%. Alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin significantly decreased the TNF-α level, increased the relative abundance of  and downregulated three genes ( and ) that are associated with inflammation and cancer. Alternating the consumption of some bioactive compounds, such as β-glucan and quercetin, in food can contribute to human health.

Therefore we want to investigate whether the dCCA has a certain correlation with biliary microecology, and to detect specific strains.A total of 68 adults were enrolled, of whom 8 with dCCA, 16 with recurrent choledocholithiasis, and 44 with the onset of common bile duct stones. Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancretography (ERCP) was utilized to collect bile samples for DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, followed by analysis of bile  composition.First, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria are the most dominant phyla in the bile of patients with dCCA and the onset of common bile duct stoes. Secondly, compared with the onset of common bile duct stones patients, we got a significant increase in the phylum Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospirae, Chloroflexi, Latescibacteria, and Planctomycetes in dCCA patients. Finally, at the genus level, we obtained sequencing results of 252 bacterial genera from patients with dCCA, recurrent choledocholithiasis, and the new onset of common bile duct stones, revealing heterogeneity among individuals.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the dysbiosis of bile flora in patients with dCCA. This micro-ecological disorder may be a decisive factor in the formation of dCCA. At the same time, for the first time, this study provides a test chart of biliary microbial populations that may be associated with recurrent choledocholithiasis. The compositional changes of the core microbial group of the biliary tract have potentially important biological and medical significance for the microbiological biliary disorders of dCCA.Copyright © 2019 Bingrong Chen et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660948>The human gut bacteria Christensenellaceae are widespread, heritable, and associated with health.</a></h2><p>The Christensenellaceae, a recently described family in the phylum Firmicutes, is emerging as an important player in human health. The relative abundance of Christensenellaceae in the human gut is inversely related to host body mass index (BMI) in different populations and multiple studies, making its relationship with BMI the most robust and reproducible link between the microbial ecology of the human gut and metabolic disease reported to date. The family is also related to a healthy status in a number of other different disease contexts, including obesity and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, Christensenellaceae is highly heritable across multiple populations, although specific human genes underlying its heritability have so far been elusive. Further research into the microbial ecology and metabolism of these bacteria should reveal mechanistic underpinnings of their host-health associations and enable their development as therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653831>Dietary tryptophan links encephalogenicity of autoreactive T cells with gut microbial ecology.</a></h2><p>The interaction between the mammalian host and its resident gut  is known to license adaptive immune responses. Nutritional constituents strongly influence composition and functional properties of the intestinal microbial communities. Here, we report that omission of a single essential amino acid - tryptophan - from the diet abrogates CNS autoimmunity in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Dietary tryptophan restriction results in impaired encephalitogenic T cell responses and is accompanied by a mild intestinal inflammatory response and a profound phenotypic shift of gut . Protective effects of dietary tryptophan restriction are abrogated in germ-free mice, but are independent of canonical host sensors of intracellular tryptophan metabolites. We conclude that dietary tryptophan restriction alters metabolic properties of gut , which in turn have an impact on encephalitogenic T cell responses. This link between gut , dietary tryptophan and adaptive immunity may help to develop therapeutic strategies for protection from autoimmune neuroinflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650861>The effects of medication adherence on study outcomes in randomized clinical trials: a role for cognitive dysfunction?</a></h2><p>Medication nonadherence is common and has been associated with poor health outcomes. Older adults are especially likely to be non-adherent to their medications, as they often have more medications to manage and are at greater risk for cognitive dysfunction. Though less frequently examined, the association between cognitive dysfunction and nonadherence also likely extends to clinical trials research. The current study used archival data to examine the potential impact of cognitive dysfunction on adherence to a nutritional supplement as part of a 90-day randomized clinical trial in neurologically healthy middle-aged and older adults. Results showed overall cognitive performance was predictive of adherence to capsule intake when controlling for polypharmacy [(1,157) = 6.53,  < .01]. These results suggest that cognitive dysfunction may impact findings from RCTs through its adverse impact on adherence to study protocol, possibly leading to greater treatment variance, artificially reduced treatment effects, lower study power, and distorted study outcomes and conclusions. A better understanding of methodological and statistical approaches to account for these unwanted effects are needed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664483>Relationship between gut , probiotics, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>The worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is constantly increasing, and it has become a major concern, with several implications for public health, economy, and social well-being.

However, their associations with lung cancer risk have not been well investigated.To evaluate the individual and joint associations of dietary fiber and yogurt consumption with lung cancer risk and to assess the potential effect modification of the associations by lifestyle and other dietary factors.This pooled analysis included 10 prospective cohorts involving 1 445 850 adults from studies that were conducted in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Data analyses were performed between November 2017 and February 2019. Using harmonized individual participant data, hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for lung cancer risk associated with dietary fiber and yogurt intakes were estimated for each cohort by Cox regression and pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Participants who had a history of cancer at enrollment or developed any cancer, died, or were lost to follow-up within 2 years after enrollment were excluded.Dietary fiber intake and yogurt consumption measured by validated instruments.Incident lung cancer, subclassified by histologic type (eg, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma).The analytic sample included 627 988 men, with a mean (SD) age of 57.9 (9.0) years, and 817 862 women, with a mean (SD) age of 54.8 (9.7) years. During a median follow-up of 8.6 years, 18 822 incident lung cancer cases were documented. Both fiber and yogurt intakes were inversely associated with lung cancer risk after adjustment for status and pack-years of smoking and other lung cancer risk factors: hazard ratio, 0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.91) for the highest vs lowest quintile of fiber intake; and hazard ratio, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.87) for high vs no yogurt consumption. The fiber or yogurt associations with lung cancer were significant in never smokers and were consistently observed across sex, race/ethnicity, and tumor histologic type. When considered jointly, high yogurt consumption with the highest quintile of fiber intake showed more than 30% reduced risk of lung cancer than nonyogurt consumption with the lowest quintile of fiber intake (hazard ratio, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.61-0.73] in total study populations; hazard ratio 0.69 [95% CI, 0.54-0.89] in never smokers), suggesting potential synergism.Dietary fiber and yogurt consumption was associated with reduced risk of lung cancer after adjusting for known risk factors and among never smokers.

We focused on examining bacterial community composition, antibiotic resistance (AR) and microbial source tracking (MST) of fecal bacteria on the floor surfaces. Swab samples were collected from carpet and vinyl floors in three different buildings (medical, veterinary, and office buildings) from high and low traffic areas. Bacterial communities were determined with 16S rRNA sequencing, and AR (tetracycline (Q), sulfonamide, and carbapenem (KPC)) and MST (human-, canine-, avian-, and ruminant-specific fecal bacteria) were examined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The results show that  and  were the most abundant phyla. Traffic level significantly affected the number of operational taxonomic units. Traffic level was a key factor for distinctive bacterial community in the medical center. Targeted ARGs were detected from all buildings and Q concentration was related with traffic level, and KPC was only detected from the medical center. Most of the floor surfaces showed the presence of dog-specific fecal bacteria (83%) followed by bird-specific fecal bacteria (75%). The results suggest that traffic levels affected the bacterial levels and fecal contamination is prevalent on the floor surfaces. This is the first study that reports KPC presence on the floor surfaces.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655448>Waxing and cultivar affect Salmonella enterica persistence on cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) fruit.</a></h2><p>A dearth of knowledge exists on the pathogen-commodity association of Salmonella enterica on cucumber, despite cucumbers being implicated in multiple salmonellosis outbreaks in recent years in the U.S. Data are lacking on cultivar susceptibility to Salmonella colonization in relation to heterogeneity in fruit surface morphology. Further, fruit waxing is a common practice in wholesale cucumber to preserve the water content of fruit and prolong shelf-life, but its impact on epiphytic  is not well studied. This study investigated the survival of Salmonella Newport and S. Javiana on the surface of six cucumber cultivars of varying surface morphology and the effect of fruit waxing on the persistence of S. Newport. S. Newport and S. Javiana were spot inoculated onto fruit of cultivars 'Marketmore 97', 'Patio Snacker' and 'Corinto' (varieties with trichomes or spines), and 'Bella', 'Pepinex' and 'Summer Dance' (glabrous or smooth varieties). Cucumbers were held at room temperature for 24 h before inoculated sections of exocarp were excised for enteropathogen enumeration. S. Javiana persisted at higher populations than S. Newport (1.0 and 1.5 log CFU g exocarp decline, respectively) after 24 h (P < 0.05). Fruit waxing lessened S. Newport population decline after 24 h on all cultivars tested (P < 0.01). While there was a ~2 log CFU g exocarp decline in populations on unwaxed cucumbers, the reduction on waxed cucumbers was ~1 log CFU g exocarp. A cultivar effect was also observed; 'Summer Dance' supported consistently higher and 'Corinto' and 'Marketmore 97' (though for S. Javiana only) consistently lower Salmonella levels. Cultivars with trichomes were associated with lower populations than glabrous cultivars (P < 0.05). Our data showed that Salmonella persistence on fruit differed for the two serotypes tested and that cultivar differences play a role in determining cucumber surface favourability for pathogen colonization. Additionally, fruit waxing may elevate the risk of Salmonella persistence on cucumber.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The earthworms Aporrectodea caliginosa (Savigny, 1826) and Octolasion lacteum (Örley, 1881) were the two species that were most frequently found at visited sites, however, only O. lacteum was present at sufficient number across different exposure levels to enable comparative hologenome analysis. The identification of morphotype O. lacteum as a probable single clade was established using a combination of mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase I) and nuclear genome (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) using MspI loci). No clear site associated differences in population genetic structure was found between populations using the AFLP marker loci. Further, no relationship between ionising radiation exposure levels and the percentage of methylated loci or pattern of distribution of DNA methylation marks was found.  structure was clearly site dependent, with gut  community structure and diversity being systematically associated with calculated site-specific earthworm dose rates. There was, however, also co-correlation between earthworm dose rates and other soil properties, notably soil pH; a property known to affect soil bacterial community structure. Such co-correlation means that it is not possible to attribute  changes unequivocally to radionuclide exposure. A better understanding of the relationship between radionuclide exposure soil properties and their interactions on bacterial  community response is, therefore, needed to establish whether these the observed  changes are attributed directly to radiation exposure, other soil properties or to an interaction between multiple variables at sites within the CEZ.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Dietary fiber is neither digested nor absorbed in the small intestine and modulates the composition of the gut . New evidence indicates that dietary fiber also directly interacts with the epithelium and immune cells throughout the gastrointestinal tract by -independent effects. This review provides a focused overview of how dietary fiber improve human health and how these reported health benefits are connected to molecular pathways, in (1) a -independent manner, via interaction with specific surface receptors on epithelial and immune cells regulating intestinal barrier and immune function, (2) a -dependent manner via maintaining intestinal homeostasis by promoting beneficial microbes, including Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, limiting the growth, adhesion and cytotoxicity of pathogenic microbes, as well as stimulating fiber-derived microbial short-chain fatty acid production.This article is protected by copyright.

Nevertheless, insects' tolerance to Bt is influenced by environmental factors affecting immunity. To understand larval immune response in the devastating coleopteran insect pest Colorado potato beetle (CPB), we undertook a proteomic analysis of hemolymph of non-treated control larvae and larvae consuming non-lethal doses of spore-crystal mixtures containing the coleopteran-active Cry3Aa toxin. Results revealed lower amount of proteins involved in insect growth and higher amount of immune response-related proteins in challenged insects, sustaining the larval weight loss observed. Additionally, we found a potential regulatory role of the evolutionary conserved miR-8 in the insect's immune response relying on antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) production. Upon toxin challenge, different patterns of hemolymph AMPs expression and phenoloxidase activity were observed in CPB larvae reared on different Solanaceae plants. This suggests that diet and diet-associated insect midgut  might modulate this insects' tolerance to non-lethal doses of Bt.Copyright © 2019.

The brown dog tick ( sensu lato) is the principal vector of this pathogen in Arizona. Domesticated dogs () are the tick's main host, so free-roaming dogs in peridomestic areas have been named the primary risk factor for human cases of RMSF. However, the sudden emergence and long-distance dispersal of the pathogen have not been adequately explained, and one possible mechanism could include wildlife. Coyotes () are wide ranging in Arizona and closely related to dogs, so it is possible that brown dog ticks parasitize coyotes and infect them. Although  is the most severe spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsial pathogen in humans, others occur in Arizona, and antibodies raised against them are cross-reactive, so we more-broadly hypothesized that coyotes in Arizona are exposed to SFG rickettsiae. We collected coyote tissues in spring 2016 and 2017. We tested sera for antibodies to  and found 9% (8/94) of samples were antibody-positive with titers of ≥256. Subsequent quantitative PCR analyses of skin showed evidence for  spp. in 2.9% (4/138) of samples. These data suggest that coyotes have a role in the maintenance of SFG rickettsiae in Arizona.

Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overactivity, especially in the kidneys, is an important mechanism linking obesity to hypertension. Some adipokines play important roles in elevating blood pressure (BP). Hyperinsulinemia caused by insulin resistance stimulates sodium reabsorption, enhances sodium retention, and increases circulating plasma volume. Hyperinsulinemia also stimulates both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the SNS, resulting in the acceleration of atherosclerosis through the hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells, which contributes to increased peripheral vascular resistance. Obesity is associated with increased RAAS activity despite volume overload, as the tissue RAASs are stimulated in obese hypertensive individuals. Mineralocorticoid receptor-associated hypertension must also be considered in obese patients with resistant hypertension. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Some components of the gut  contribute to BP control; therefore, gut dysbiosis caused by obesity might lead to increased BP. The ratio of visceral fat to subcutaneous fat is higher in Japanese patients than in Caucasian patients, which may explain why Japanese patients are more susceptible to metabolic disorders even though they are less obese than Caucasian individuals. Obesity-associated kidney dysfunction directly increases BP, leading to further deterioration of kidney function. A bodyweight reduction of more than 3% or 5 kg significantly lowers BP. Gastrointestinal bypass surgery is an effective treatment for morbid obesity and its related metabolic disorders, including hypertension. Because both obesity and hypertension are representative lifestyle-related disorders, lifestyle modification, especially to improve obesity, should be performed first as a treatment for hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662431>Interrogation of Internal Workings in Microbial Community Assembly: Play a Game through a Behavioral Network?</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence shows that the influence of  on biogeochemical cycling, plant development, and human health is executed through a complex network of microbe-microbe interactions. However, characterizing how microbes interact and work together within closely packed and highly heterogeneous microbial ecosystems is extremely challenging. Here, we describe a rule-of-thumb framework for visualizing polymicrobial interactions and extracting general principles that underlie microbial communities. We integrate elements of metabolic ecology, behavioral ecology, and game theory to quantify the interactive strategies by which microbes at any taxonomic level compete for resources and cooperate symbiotically with each other to form and stabilize ecological communities. We show how the framework can chart an omnidirectional landscape of microbial cooperation and competition that may drive various natural processes. This framework can be implemented into genome-wide association studies to unravel the genetic mechanisms underlying microbial interaction networks and their evolutionary consequences along spatiotemporal gradients. Identifying general biological rules that underlie the complexity and heterogeneity of microbial communities has proven to be highly challenging. We present a rule-of-thumb framework for studying and characterizing how microbes interact with each other across different taxa to determine community behavior and dynamics. This framework is computationally simple but conceptually meaningful, and it can provide a starting point to generate novel biological hypotheses about microbial interactions and explore internal workings of microbial community assembly in depth.Copyright © 2019 Wang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652531>The Role of Glutamine in the Complex Interaction between Gut  and Health: A Narrative Review.</a></h2><p>The scientific literature has demonstrated that glutamine is one of the main beneficial amino acids. It plays an important role in gut  and immunity. This paper provides a critical overview of experimental studies (in vitro, in vivo, and clinical) investigating the efficacy of glutamine and its effect on gut . As a result of this review, we have summarized that glutamine could affect gut  via different mechanisms including the reduction in the ratio of  to  with the activation of NF-κB and PI3K-Akt pathways, reducing the intestinal colonization ( lesions) and bacterial overgrowth or bacterial translocation, increasing the production of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) and immunoglobulin A+ (IgA) cells in the intestinal lumen, and decreasing asparagine levels. The potential applications of glutamine on gut  include, but are not limited to, the management of obesity, bacterial translocation and community, cytokines profiles, and the management of side effects during post-chemotherapy and constipation periods.

The fecal samples were collected for 16S rRNA-amplicon sequencing to analyze the composition and richness of gut . Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering was performed using Usearch software. Intra-sample diversity (alpha-diversity) analysis and inter-sample diversity (beta-diversity) analyses were performed. The community richness was compared between the two groups at family and genus levels.There were 1903 and 1880 OTUs identified in the control and frailty groups, respectively, with 1282 OTUs overlap between the two groups. The alpha diversity of  community was similar between the two groups, whereas the frailty group had larger beta diversity than the control group. The top-10 taxonomy categories and abundances of gut  between the two groups were similar. As for the gut  composition, 4 families and 17 genera were significantly different between the two groups (p < 0.05).These results suggested that frailty can affect gut  diversity and compositions in late elderly hospitalized patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650468>Baicalein, an enteric microbial metabolite, suppresses gut inflammation and cancer progression in Apc mice.</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammation is recognized as a risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Baicalin (BI), a major constituent in an anti-inflammatory herb Scutellaria baicalensis, can be biotransformed into baicalein (BE) by the intestinal . We evaluated the anti-inflammation and anti-CRC effects of the metabolite BE.The in vitro biotransformation by human intestinal  from BI into BE has been determined with HPLC. Using a gut-specific Apc mouse model, the effects of oral BE on the life span, organ index, and tumor multiplicity were evaluated. The expressions of inflammatory cytokines were determined using ELISA. To verify the in vivo data, the anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects of BE were determined with an in vitro cell model.HPLC analysis showed that BI was quickly transformed into BE by the intestinal . Oral BE (30 mg/kg/day) significantly increased the life span, from 125.2 to 218.4 days (P < 0.01%). BE treatment also decreased intestine index and increased spleen index. Compared with the model group, following BE treatment, tumor numbers were significantly reduced in the small intestine and colon (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, respectively). In the gut tissues, BE treatment significantly reduced inflammatory cytokine levels such as IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, G-CSF, and GM-CSF. In vitro data supported our in vivo results that the anti-CRC effects of BE were via the inhibition of gut inflammation and induction of cancer cell death.Our results suggest that the parent compound BI can be quickly converted into its microbial metabolite BE, which has stronger bioactive effects than BI.

We hypothesized that broad-spectrum disease resistance alleles also affect colonization by non-pathogenic symbionts. ●Quantitative trait loci (QTL) conferring resistance to multiple fungal pathogens were introgressed into a disease-susceptible maize inbred line. Bacterial and fungal leaf microbiomes of the resulting near-isogenic lines were compared to the  of the disease-susceptible parent line at two timepoints in multiple fields. ●Introgression of QTL from disease-resistant lines strongly shifted the relative abundance of diverse fungal and bacterial taxa in both 3-week-old and 7-week-old plants. Nevertheless, the effects on overall community structure and diversity were minor and varied among fields and years. Contrary to our expectations, host genotype effects were not any stronger in fields with high disease pressure than in uninfected fields, and  succession over time was similar in heavily infected and uninfected plants. ●These results show that introgressed QTL can greatly improve broad-spectrum disease resistance while having only limited and inconsistent pleiotropic effects on the leaf  in maize.© 2019 The Authors New Phytologist © 2019 New Phytologist Trust.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662430>Metabolic Modeling of Streptococcus mutans Reveals Complex Nutrient Requirements of an Oral Pathogen.</a></h2><p> is a Gram-positive bacterium that thrives under acidic conditions and is a primary cause of tooth decay (dental caries). To better understand the metabolism of  on a systematic level, we manually constructed a genome-scale metabolic model of the  type strain UA159. The model, called iSMU, contains 675 reactions involving 429 metabolites and the products of 493 genes. We validated iSMU by comparing simulations with growth experiments in defined medium. The model simulations matched experimental results for 17 of 18 carbon source utilization assays and 47 of 49 nutrient depletion assays. We also simulated the effects of single gene deletions. The model's predictions agreed with 78.1% and 84.4% of the gene essentiality predictions from two experimental data sets. Our manually curated model is more accurate than  models generated from automated reconstruction pipelines and more complete than other manually curated models. We used iSMU to generate hypotheses about the  metabolic network. Subsequent genetic experiments confirmed that (i)  catabolizes sorbitol via a sorbitol-6-phosphate 2-dehydrogenase (SMU_308) and (ii) the Leloir pathway is required for growth on complex carbohydrates such as raffinose. We believe the iSMU model is an important resource for understanding the metabolism of  and guiding future experiments. Tooth decay is the most prevalent chronic disease in the United States. Decay is caused by the bacterium , an oral pathogen that ferments sugars into tooth-destroying lactic acid.

Interventions with prebiotics, the key modulators of the gut , have paramount impact on host-associated metabolic disorders. Herein, we investigated the effect of fungus-derived (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a highly soluble dietary fiber, on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic distress.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with different diet groups (n = 11): control diet, HFD, 3 g/kg or 5 g/kg of β-glucan-incorporated HFD. At the end of experimental study period (12th week), body weight, feces weight and fecal moisture content were observed. Further, colonic motility was measured using activated charcoal meal study. Proteins extracted from liver and intestine tissues were subjected to western blot technique. Paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues were sectioned for histochemical [Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue (AB) staining] analysis. Fecal  analysis was performed using MOTHUR bioinformatic software.β-glucan consumption exhibited anti-obesity property in mice groups fed with HFD. In addition, β-glucan ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic stress, colonic motility and intestinal atrophy (reduction in colon length, goblet cells, and mucosal layer thickness). Further, β-glucan incorporation shifted bacterial community by increasing butyrate-producing bacteria such as Anaerostipes, Coprobacillus, and Roseburia and decreasing reportedly obesity-associated bacteria such as Parabacteroides and Lactococcus.Altogether, the outcomes of this present pre-clinical animal study show β-glucan to be a promising therapeutic candidate in the treatment of HFD-induced metabolic distress. Further comprehensive research has to be conducted to brace its clinical relevance, reproducibility and efficacy for aiding human health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659049>Microbial communities in the tropical air ecosystem follow a precise diel cycle.</a></h2><p>The atmosphere is vastly underexplored as a habitable ecosystem for microbial organisms. In this study, we investigated 795 time-resolved metagenomes from tropical air, generating 2.27 terabases of data. Despite only 9 to 17% of the generated sequence data currently being assignable to taxa, the air harbored a microbial diversity that rivals the complexity of other planetary ecosystems. The airborne microbial organisms followed a clear diel cycle, possibly driven by environmental factors. Interday taxonomic diversity exceeded day-to-day and month-to-month variation. Environmental time series revealed the existence of a large core of microbial taxa that remained invariable over 13 mo, thereby underlining the long-term robustness of the airborne community structure. Unlike terrestrial or aquatic environments, where prokaryotes are prevalent, the tropical airborne biomass was dominated by DNA from eukaryotic phyla. Specific fungal and bacterial species were strongly correlated with temperature, humidity, and CO concentration, making them suitable biomarkers for studying the bioaerosol dynamics of the atmosphere.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

They are required for the generation of cellular energy, regulation of calcium homeostasis and controlling programmed cell death. Defective mitochondrial homeostasis is frequently reported in a broad range of neurological disorders. Many lines of evidence suggest that it plays an essential role in aging, and neurodegeneration. Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and its aetiology is still largely unexplored. Overwhelming evidence indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in PD pathogenesis. Various genes involved in maintaining the mitochondrial homeostasis are also associated with the PD pathophysiology. Alterations in mitochondrial functions such as generation of reactive oxygen species, impaired mitophagy, altered mitochondrial dynamics, impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and Ca buffering, may precede the development of PD pathology. In addition, recent studies have also shown the involvement of gut  in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including PD. In this context, mitochondria-targeted therapies that can ameliorate the mitochondrial abnormalities may have great promise in the prevention and treatment of PD. This review aims to discuss the mitochondrial dysfunction associatedwithPD pathogenesis and various mitochondrial targeted therapies that can improve the mitochondrial function and deplete the severity of disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Mitochondria Research Society.

The bacterial  inside the host is vital to host health and growth performance. The purpose of this study was to explore the possible associations of the intestinal  with the pre-weaned weight gain in intensive pig production. In this study, several anatomical sites (jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon) were examined for bacterial  structure using 16S rRNA V4-V5 region sequencing with Illumina Miseq. The results showed that the microbial richness (estimated by Chao1 index) in jejunum was positively correlated with the pre-weaned weight gain. This study also revealed that the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in colon were the weight gaining-related phyla; while the Selenomonas and Moraxella in ileum and the Lactobacillus in both cecum and colon were the weight gaining-related genera for the pre-weaned piglets in intensive pig prodution. Several intra-microbial interactions within commensal  correlated with the pre-weaned weight gain were excavated, as well. Overall, this study provides an expanded view of the commensal bacterial community inside four anatomical intestinal sites of the commercial piglets and the associations of the intestinal  with the pre-weaned weight gaining performance in intensive pig production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665573>Fecal  Transplantation for Dysbiosis - Predictable Risks.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658427>Bacterial  associated with the rhizosphere and root interior of crops in Saskatchewan, Canada.</a></h2><p>Rhizosphere and root associated bacteria are key components of plant-microbiomes and influence crop production. In sustainable agriculture, it is important to investigate bacteria diversity in various plant species and how edaphic factors influence the bacterial . In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing to assess bacterial communities associated with the rhizosphere and root interior of canola, wheat, field pea, and lentil grown at four locations in Saskatchewan, Canada. Rhizosphere bacteria communities exhibited distinct profiles among crops and sampling locations. However, each crop associated with distinct root endophytic bacterial communities, suggesting that crop species may influence the selection of root bacterial . Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla in the root interior, whereas Gemmatimonadetes, Firmicutes and Acidobacteria were prevalent in the rhizosphere soil. Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas were predominant in the rhizosphere and root interior, whereas Acinetobacter, Arthrobacter, Rhizobium, Streptomyces, Variovorax and Xanthomonas were dominant in the root interior of all crops. The relative abundance of specific bacterial groups in the rhizosphere, correlated with soil pH, silt and organic matter contents, however, there was no correlation between root endophytes and analyzed soil properties.

However, retrieving and interpreting the structure of such datasets requires efficient methods for dimensionality reduction. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) can be used to decompose environmental DNA samples into overlapping assemblages of co-occurring taxa. It is a flexible model-based method adapted to uneven sample sizes and to large and sparse datasets. Here, we compare LDA performance on abundance and occurrence data, and we quantify the robustness of the LDA decomposition by measuring its stability with respect to the algorithm's initialization. We then apply LDA to a survey of 1,131 soil DNA samples that were collected in a 12-ha plot of primary tropical forest and amplified using standard primers for bacteria, protists, fungi, and metazoans. The analysis reveals that bacteria, protists, and fungi exhibit a strong spatial structure, which matches the topographical features of the plot, while metazoans do not, confirming that microbial diversity is primarily controlled by environmental variation at the studied scale. We conclude that LDA is a sensitive, robust and computationally efficient method to detect and interpret the structure of large DNA-based biodiversity datasets.

We hypothesized that fecal samples representing the gut  of rainbow trout could be associated with differential growth rates observed in fish breeding programs. If true, harnessing the functionality of this  can improve the profitability of aquaculture. The first objective of this study was to test this hypothesis if gut  is associated with fish growth rate (body weight). Four full-sibling families were stocked in the same tank and fed an identical diet. Two fast-growing and two slow-growing fish were selected from each family for 16S rRNA  profiling.  diversity varies with different DNA extraction methods. The second objective of this study was to compare the effects of five commonly used DNA extraction methods on the  profiling and to determine the most appropriate extraction method for this study. These methods were Promega-Maxwell, Phenol-chloroform, MO-BIO, Qiagen-Blood/Tissue, and Qiagen-Stool. Methods were compared according to DNA integrity, cost, feasibility and inter-sample variation based on non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination (nMDS) clusters.Differences in DNA extraction methods resulted in significant variation in the identification of bacteria that compose the gut . Promega-Maxwell had the lowest inter-sample variation and was therefore used for the subsequent analyses. Beta diversity of the bacterial communities showed significant variation between breeding families but not between the fast- and slow-growing fish. However, an indicator analysis determined that cellulose, amylose degrading and amino acid fermenting bacteria (Clostridium, Leptotrichia, and Peptostreptococcus) are indicator taxa of the fast-growing fish. In contrary, pathogenic bacteria (Corynebacterium and Paeniclostridium) were identified as indicator taxa for the slow-growing fish.DNA extraction methodology should be carefully considered for accurate profiling of the gut . Although the  was not significantly different between the fast- and slow-growing fish groups, some bacterial taxa with functional implications were indicative of fish growth rate. Further studies are warranted to explore how bacteria are transmitted and potential usage of the indicator bacteria of fast-growing fish for development of probiotics that may improve fish health and growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647664>Fresh ideas bloom in gut healthcare to cross-fertilize lake management.</a></h2><p>Harmful bacteria may be the most significant threat to human gut and lake ecosystem health, and they are often managed using similar tools, like poisoning with antibiotics or algicides. Out-of-the-box thinking in human  engineering is leading to novel methods, like engineering bacteria to kill pathogens, "persuade" them not to produce toxins or "mop up" their toxins. The bacterial agent can be given a competitive edge via an exclusive nutrient, and they can be engineered to commit suicide once their work is done. Viruses can kill pathogens with specific DNA sequences or knock out their antibiotic resistance genes using CRISPR technology. Some of these ideas may work for lakes. We critically review novel methods for managing harmful bacteria in the gut from the perspective of managing toxic cyanobacteria in lakes, and discuss practical aspects such as modifying bacteria using genetic engineering or directed evolution, mass culturing and controlling the agents. A key knowledge gap is in the ecology of strains, like toxigenic vs. nontoxigenic Microcystis, including allelopathic and Black Queen interactions. Some of the "gut methods" may have future potential for lakes, but there presently is no substitute for established management approaches, including reducing N and P nutrient inputs, and mitigating climate change.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665823>Translating In Vitro Acrolein-Trapping Capacities of Tea Polyphenol and Soy Genistein to In Vivo Situation is Mediated by the Bioavailability and Biotransformation of Individual Polyphenols.</a></h2><p>Acrolein is a highly toxic unsaturated aldehyde. Humans are both endogenously and exogenously exposed to acrolein. Long-term exposure to acrolein leads to various chronic diseases. Dietary polyphenols have been reported to be able to attenuate acrolein-induced toxicity in vitro via formation of acrolein-polyphenol conjugates. However, whether in vitro acrolein-trapping abilities of polyphenols can be maintained under in vivo environments is still unknown.Two most commonly consumed dietary polyphenols, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) from tea and genistein from soy, were used to evaluate for their anti-acrolein behaviors both in vitro and in mice. Tea EGCG exerted much higher capacity to capture acrolein than soy genistein in vitro. But translation of in vitro anti-acrolein activity into in vivo was mainly mediated by bioavailability and biotransformation of individual polyphenols. We found that 1) both absorbed EGCG and genistein could trap endogenous ACR by forming mono-ACR adducts and eventually be excreted into mouse urine; 2) both absorbed EGCG and genistein could produce active metabolites, MeEGCG and orobol, to scavenge endogenous ACR; 3) both MeEGCG and non-absorbed EGCG showed ability to trap ACR in the gut; 4) considerable amounts of microbial metabolites of genistein displayed enhanced anti-ACR capacity both in the body and in the gut, compared to genistein; and 5) biotransformation of genistein is able to boost its in vivo anti-ACR capacity, compared to EGCG.Our findings demonstrate that in vivo anti-acrolein ability of dietary polyphenols cannot be reflected solely based on their in vitro ability. The bioavailability and biotransformation of individual polyphenols especially gut  contribute to in vivo anti-acrolein ability of dietary polyphenols. This article is protected by copyright.

The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship among layer breed, microbial structure and odor production.Thirty Hy-Line Gray and thirty Lohmann Pink laying hens were used in this study to determine the impact of cecal microbial structure on odor production of laying hens. The hens were managed under the same husbandry and dietary regimes. Results of in vivo experiments showed a lower hydrogen sulfide (HS) production from Hy-Line hens and a lower concentration of soluble sulfide (S) but a higher concentration of butyrate in the cecal content of the Hy-Line hens compared to Lohmann Pink hens (P < 0.05), which was consistent with the in vitro experiments (P < 0.05). However, ammonia (NH) production was not different between genotypes (P > 0.05). Significant microbial structural differences existed between the two breed groups. The relative abundance of some butyrate producers (including Butyricicoccus, Butyricimonas and Roseburia) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (including Mailhella and Lawsonia) were found to be significantly correlated with odor production and were shown to be different in the 16S rRNA and PCR data between two breed groups. Furthermore, some bacterial metabolism pathways associated with energy extraction and carbohydrate utilization (oxidative phosphorylation, pyruvate metabolism, energy metabolism, two component system and secretion system) were overrepresented in the Hy-Line hens, while several amino acid metabolism-associated pathways (amino acid related enzymes, arginine and proline metabolism, and alanine-aspartate and glutamate metabolism) were more prevalent in the Lohmann hens.The results of this study suggest that genotype of laying hens influence cecal , which in turn modulates their odor production.

We analyzed whether vitamin D deficiency alters rat gut . Male Wistar rats were fed a standard or a vitamin D-free diet for seven weeks. The  composition was determined in fecal samples by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The vitamin D-free diet produced mild changes on α- diversity but no effect on β-diversity in the global . Markers of gut dysbiosis like -to- ratio or the short chain fatty acid producing bacterial genera were not significantly affected by vitamin D deficiency. Notably, there was an increase in the relative abundance of the , with significant rises in its associated genera ,  and  in vitamin D deficient rats.  and  were also increased and  and its genus  were decreased in rats with vitamin D-free diet.

Disturbance in the human gut  is now considered a critical factor in the atherosclerosis. Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) attracts attention and is regarded as a vital contributor in the development of atherosclerosis. TMAO is generated from its dietary precursors choline, carnitine, and phosphatidylcholine by gut  into an intermediate compound known as trimethylamine (TMA), which is then oxidized into TMAO by hepatic flavin monooxygenases. The present review focus on advances in TMAO preventing strategies through probiotics, including, modulation of gut , metabolomics profile, miRNA, or probiotic antagonistic abilities.

Emerging data suggest oral microbes may contribute to the onset and severity of this acute side effect.In this study, saliva and oral swabs from head and neck cancer patients undergoing RT were collected. We employed molecular microbiological techniques to study the bacterial communities present in saliva, and both the bacterial and fungal communities present on the buccal mucosa and lateral tongue. Changes in  composition with increasing radiation dose and the presence of mucositis were examined.The data suggest that the salivary  remain stable during RT and are consistently dominated by Streptococcus, Prevotella, Fusobacterium and Granulicatella. Obligate and facultative anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) Bacteroidales G2, Capnocytophaga, Eikenella, Mycoplasma and Sneathia, as well as anaerobic GNB in the periopathogenic genera Porphyromonas and Tannerella, were all positively correlated with ≥ grade 2 OM. Significant increases in the relative abundances of Bacteroidales G2, Fusobacterium and Sneathia were identified in buccal mucosa swabs at sites of ≥ grade 2 OM (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the abundance of several GNB (Fusobacterium, Haemophilus, Tannerella, Porphyromonas and Eikenella) on the buccal mucosa may influence patient susceptibility to developing OM. Candida was widely detected in buccal mucosa swabs, regardless of mucositis status.Our findings support previously hypothesized associations between oral health and the pathogenesis of OM, highlighting the importance of oral health interventions for head and neck cancer patients.</p></html>
