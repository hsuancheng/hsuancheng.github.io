Px rats were provided with a high-fat diet containing 0.6% KME-E, 0.6% KME-W, and 0.6% dextrin (control) for 8 weeks. As normal-control, Sham-operated rats were provided with 0.6% dextrin. In cell-based studies, the effects of its main terpenoids (betulin, , and oleanolic acid) on glucose metabolism were measured. Both KME-W and KME-E decreased epididymal fat mass by increasing fat oxidation in diabetic rats. KME-E but not KME-W exhibited greater potentiation of first-phase insulin secretion than the Px-control in a hyperglycemic clamp. KME-E also made β-cell mass greater than the control by increasing β-cell proliferation and decreasing its apoptosis. In a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, whole-body glucose infusion rate and hepatic glucose output increased with potentiating hepatic insulin signaling in the following order: Px-control, KME-W, KME-E, and normal-control. Betulin potentiated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake via increased PPAR-γ activity and insulin signaling in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, whereas oleanolic acid enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and cell proliferation in insulinoma cells. In conclusion, KME-E prevented the deterioration of glucose metabolism in diabetic rats more effectively than KME-W and KME-E can be a better therapeutic agent for type 2 diabetes than KME-W.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28757534>Triterpenoids Isolated from Ziziphus jujuba Enhance Glucose Uptake Activity in Skeletal Muscle Cells.</a></h1><p>Jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.), a traditional folk medicine and functional food in China and South Korea, is known for its beneficial properties, which include anti-cancer, anti-oxidative, and anti- effects. To assess the anti-hyperglycemic effect of jujube in this study, we investigated the glucose uptake-promoting activity of jujube in rat L6 myotubes. After determining that the jujube extract induces muscle glucose uptake, we identified the following active compounds by bioassay-guided fractionation: betulonic acid, , and oleanonic acid. Ursonic acid, known to be present in jujube, was semi-synthesized from ursolic acid and also observed to enhance glucose uptake. These four triterpenic acids induced glucose uptake in a glucose transporter 4-dependent manner. Comparison experiments of jujube fruits from three countries, namely, China, South Korea, and Japan, revealed that Japanese jujube has a higher content of active triterpenoids and is the most potent enhancer of glucose uptake.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26865097>Selective binding modes and allosteric inhibitory effects of lupane triterpenes on protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B.</a></h1><p>Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) has been recognized as a promising therapeutic target for treating , diabetes, and certain cancers for over a decade. Previous drug design has focused on inhibitors targeting the active site of PTP1B. However, this has not been successful because the active site is positively charged and conserved among the protein tyrosine phosphatases. Therefore, it is important to develop PTP1B inhibitors with alternative inhibitory strategies. Using computational studies including molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and binding free energy calculations, we found that lupane triterpenes selectively inhibited PTP1B by targeting its more hydrophobic and less conserved allosteric site. These findings were verified using two enzymatic assays. Furthermore, the cell culture studies showed that lupeol and  inhibited the PTP1B activity stimulated by TNFα in neurons. Our study indicates that lupane triterpenes are selective PTP1B allosteric inhibitors with significant potential for treating those diseases with elevated PTP1B activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27114690>The Potent Inhibitors of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B from the Fruits of Melaleuca leucadendron.</a></h1><p>Melaleuca leucadendron (Myrtaceae) is a kind of fruit used as Indonesian medicinal component and recorded in Jamu (tonic made of medical herbs) prescription records for the diabetes treatment. Its methanol extract exhibited a strong inhibitory activity with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 2.05 μg/mL, while it is the same value with positive control RK-682.To isolate the chemical constituents of M. leucadendron and to evaluate their activity against protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). Further, determine their toxicity potential against T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP).Methanol extract was fractionated using silica column chromatography, and the obtained fraction was purified using Sephadex 20-LH. The structure of isolated compounds was identified based on (1)H and (13)Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometry. Furthermore, the compounds were examined against PTP1B and TCPTP.Methanol extract of M. leucadendron (Myrtaceae) afforded two triterpenes:  and ursolic acid in high quantities. Both compounds exhibited a strong inhibitory activity against PTP1B inhibition with IC50 value of 1.5 and 2.3 μg/mL, respectively (positive control RK-682, IC50 = 2.05 μg/mL). Their activity toward TCPTP, on the other hand, were at 2.4 and 3.1 μg/mL, respectively. Based on this purification work,  and ursolic acid presented 7.6% and 2.4%, respectively, as markedly M. leucadendron most potential for  source among Indonesian plants. The result should have demonstrated that the antidiabetes of M. dendron could be through the inhibition of PTP1B.Melaleuca leucadendron is a good source for ursolic acid.Confirming traditional use for type II diabetes via PTP1B inhibition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31133421> lowers lipid accumulation in adipocytes through enhanced NCoA1-PPARγ interaction.</a></h1><p>Investigation for a naturally occurring anti- drug has become the need of society all over the world.  (BA) is a lupane-type pentacyclic triterpene and is sourced from various organisms. This high potential biologically active molecule is reported to have anti- effect. In this study, we report the molecular mechanism of action of BA that underlies anti- activity and also an improved method of its isolation common teak tree.Mouse pre-adipocyte cells were used to develop hyperlipidemic conditions in vitro. Change in expression of genes associated to adipogenesis was checked using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Co-factor specificity of PPAR gamma was analyzed through immune precipitation and immunoblot. was found to be effective in reducing the lipid content in 3T3L1 cells. Level of PPAR gamma and LXR alpha was reduced in connection to reduced adipogenesis. Change in steroid responsive co-activators (SRCs) during BA treatment proved that the compound can impart profound change in co-factor selectivity, which is crucial in determining the activity profile of PPAR gamma. BA treatment enhanced the SRC-1 interaction with PPAR gamma while reducing the levels of SRC-3.Present study has proved that , a promising candidate in anti- drug development, has potential in regulating the activity of PPAR gamma through co-factor modulation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The method is based on the chelation effect of zirconium (Zr(4+)) ions on the phosphate group, which may induce aggregation of 4-aminophenylphosphate-functionalized gold nanoparticles (APP/AuNPs) and the corresponding color change of the testing solution. Owing to the dephosphorylation of PTP1B, the aggregation of AuNPs will be influenced by PTP1B since there is no coordination reactivity between Zr(4+) ions and 4-aminophenol, the hydrolyzed product of APP catalyzed by the enzyme. Therefore, a simple colorimetric method for the assay of PTP1B activity can be developed. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the ratios of absorbance at a wavelength of 650 nm to that at 522 nm vary linearly with the PTP1B activity in the range from 0.005 to 0.18 U mL(-1) with the lowest detection limit of 0.0017 U mL(-1). Moreover, using this proposed method, the inhibition effect of 6-chloro-3-formyl-7-methylchromone, , ursolic acid, and sodium orthovanadate on PTP1B activity can be tested with IC50 values of 10, 13, 9, and 1.1 μM, respectively. Therefore, this new method has great potential not only for the detection of PTP1B activity but also for the screening of the inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30799179> inhibits high-fat diet-induced  and improves energy balance by activating AMPK.</a></h1><p>Metabolic syndromes are prevalent worldwide and result in various complications including , cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes.  (BA) is a naturally occurring triterpenoid that has anti-inflammatory properties. We hypothesized that treatment with BA may result in decreased body weight gain, adiposity and hepatic steatosis in a diet-induced mouse model of .Mice fed a high-fat diet and treated with BA showed less weight gain and tissue adiposity without any change in calorie intake. Gene expression profiling of mouse tissues and cell lines revealed that BA treatment increased expression of lipid oxidative genes and decreased that of lipogenesis-related genes. This modulation was mediated by increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, which facilitates energy expenditure, lipid oxidation and thermogenic capacity and exerts protective effects against  and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Overall, BA markedly inhibited the development of  and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice fed a high-fat diet, and AMPK activation in various tissues and enhanced thermogenesis are two possible mechanisms underlying the antiobesity and antisteatogenic effects of BA.The current findings suggest that treatment with BA is a potential dietary strategy for preventing  and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.Copyright © 2018 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.
