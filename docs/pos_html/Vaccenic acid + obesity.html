However, previous epidemiological studies on the association between TFAs, based primarily on self-reported intake from the diet, and diabetes in humans have yielded conflicting results. Herein we examined the associations of objectively measured plasma TFA concentrations with diabetes in a large population-based study among US adults.We included 3801 participants aged ≥20 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2000 and 2009-10. Four major TFAs, namely palmitelaidic acid (C16:1 n-7t), elaidic acid (C18:1 n-9t),  (C18:1 n-7t), and linolelaidic acid (C18:2 n-6t, 9t), were measured in fasting plasma using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Diabetes was defined by self-reported physician diagnosis, plasma fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL, or HbA1c ≥6.5%.After adjustment for other major risk factors, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of diabetes comparing the highest with lowest quintile of plasma TFAs was 2.19 (1.27-3.79) for total TFAs (P  = 0.01), 2.34 (1.48-3.72) for elaidic acid (P  = 0.0004), 1.33 (0.82-2.15) for linolelaidic acid (P  = 0.18), 1.58 (0.97-2.58) for palmitelaidic acid (P  = 0.02), and 1.64 (0.95-2.84) for  (P  = 0.08). In addition, total TFAs, elaidic acid, palmitelaidic acid, and  were significantly associated with fasting glucose, fasting insulin, the insulin resistance index, and HbA1c.In a nationally representative population, plasma TFAs, in particular elaidic acid, were positively associated with diabetes and biomarkers of glucose metabolism.© 2018 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27146725>New Nordic Diet versus Average Danish Diet: A Randomized Controlled Trial Revealed Healthy Long-Term Effects of the New Nordic Diet by GC-MS Blood Plasma Metabolomics.</a></h2><p>A previous study has shown effects of the New Nordic Diet (NND) to stimulate weight loss and lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure in obese Danish women and men in a randomized, controlled dietary intervention study. This work demonstrates long-term metabolic effects of the NND as compared with an Average Danish Diet (ADD) in blood plasma and reveals associations between metabolic changes and health beneficial effects of the NND including weight loss. A total of 145 individuals completed the intervention and blood samples were taken along with clinical examinations before the intervention started (week 0) and after 12 and 26 weeks. The plasma metabolome was measured using GC-MS, and the final metabolite table contained 144 variables. Significant and novel metabolic effects of the diet, resulting weight loss, gender, and intervention study season were revealed using PLS-DA and ASCA. Several metabolites reflecting specific differences in the diets, especially intake of plant foods and seafood, and in energy metabolism related to ketone bodies and gluconeogenesis formed the predominant metabolite pattern discriminating the intervention groups. Among NND subjects, higher levels of  and 3-hydroxybutanoic acid were related to a higher weight loss, while higher concentrations of salicylic, lactic, and N-aspartic acids and 1,5-anhydro-d-sorbitol were related to a lower weight loss. Specific gender and seasonal differences were also observed. The study strongly indicates that healthy diets high in fish, vegetables, fruit, and whole grain facilitated weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity by increasing ketosis and gluconeogenesis in the fasting state.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26199725>The scope for manipulating the polyunsaturated fatty acid content of beef: a review.</a></h2><p>Since 1950, links between intake of saturated fatty acids and heart disease have led to recommendations to limit consumption of saturated fatty acid-rich foods, including beef. Over this time, changes in food consumption patterns in several countries including Canada and the USA have not led to improvements in health. Instead, the incidence of , type II diabetes and associated diseases have reached epidemic proportions owing in part to replacement of dietary fat with refined carbohydrates. Despite the content of saturated fatty acids in beef, it is also rich in heart healthy cis-monounsaturated fatty acids, and can be an important source of long-chain omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids in populations where little or no oily fish is consumed. Beef also contains polyunsaturated fatty acid biohydrogenation products, including vaccenic and rumenic acids, which have been shown to have anticarcinogenic and hypolipidemic properties in cell culture and animal models. Beef can be enriched with these beneficial fatty acids through manipulation of beef cattle diets, which is now more important than ever because of increasing public understanding of the relationships between diet and health. The present review examines recommendations for beef in human diets, the need to recognize the complex nature of beef fat, how cattle diets and management can alter the fatty acid composition of beef, and to what extent content claims are currently possible for beef fatty acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29606629>Trans-Fats Inhibit Autophagy Induced by Saturated Fatty Acids.</a></h2><p>Depending on the length of their carbon backbone and their saturation status, natural fatty acids have rather distinct biological effects. Thus, longevity of model organisms is increased by extra supply of the most abundant natural cis-unsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid, but not by that of the most abundant saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid. Here, we systematically compared the capacity of different saturated, cis-unsaturated and alien (industrial or ruminant) trans-unsaturated fatty acids to provoke cellular stress in vitro, on cultured human cells expressing a battery of distinct biosensors that detect signs of autophagy, Golgi stress and the unfolded protein response. In contrast to cis-unsaturated fatty acids, trans-unsaturated fatty acids failed to stimulate signs of autophagy including the formation of GFP-LC3B-positive puncta, production of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, and activation of the transcription factor TFEB. When combined effects were assessed, several trans-unsaturated fatty acids including elaidic acid (the trans-isomer of oleate), linoelaidic acid, trans- and palmitelaidic acid, were highly efficient in suppressing autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by palmitic, but not by oleic acid. Elaidic acid also inhibited autophagy induction by palmitic acid in vivo, in mouse livers and hearts. We conclude that the well-established, though mechanistically enigmatic toxicity of trans-unsaturated fatty acids may reside in their capacity to abolish cytoprotective stress responses induced by saturated fatty acids.Copyright © 2018 German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE).

Intramuscular fat deposits have been found to compromise muscle integrity; however, the relevant fat compounds and their roles as mediators of muscular inflammation are not known. The aim of this study was to identify potential correlations between inflammation markers and lipid compounds that accumulate in the quadriceps muscle of previously described Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat model for high-fat diet- (HFD-) induced muscle loss. Six-month-old SD rats were continuously fed a control (CD) or HFD until the age of 21 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a significant decline in muscle cross-sectional area in male SD rats as a result of HFD, but not in female rats. Here, we developed a new procedure to quantitatively identify and classify the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) in rats' quadriceps muscles from our former study using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Fatty acid analysis revealed accumulation of octadecadienoic (linoleic acid), octadecanoic (stearic acid), and octadecenoic () acids exclusively in the quadriceps muscles of male rats. The designated fatty acids were mainly incorporated into triacylglycerols (TAGs) or free fatty acids (FFAs), and their proportions were significantly elevated by consumption of a HFD. Furthermore, the number of resident immune cells and the levels of the chemokines RANTES, MCP-1, and MIP-2 were significantly increased in quadriceps muscle tissue of HFD-fed male, but not female rats. Together, HFD-induced muscle loss in aged male SD rats is associated with greater deposits of long-chain fatty acid esters and increased levels of the inflammatory markers RANTES, MCP-1, and MIP-2 in skeletal muscle tissue. This trend is further reinforced by long-term consumption of a HFD, which may provoke synergistic crosstalk between long-chain fatty acids and inflammatory pathways in sarcopenic muscle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797122>Association between plasma concentrations of elaidic acid, a major trans fatty acid, and depression in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.</a></h2><p>Previous studies on health effects of trans fatty acids (TFA) have focused mainly on cardiovascular health. Little is known about the association of TFA with brain or mental health. In this study, we examined the associations of objectively-measured plasma TFA concentrations with depression in a large population-based cross-sectional study among U.S. adults.We included 2136 non-pregnant participants aged 20 years or older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009-2010. Four major TFAs, including palmitelaidic acid (C16:1n-7t), elaidic acid (C18:1n-9t),  (C18:1n-7t), and linoelaidic acid (C18:2n-6t, 9t), were measured in fasting plasma using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the validated Patient Health Questionnaire-9.Participants with depressive symptoms had a higher plasma concentration of total TFA compared with those without depressive symptoms (6.6 vs 6.0 μmol/g lipids, P = 0.046). After adjustment for other major risk factors, the odds ratio (OR) of depressive symptoms comparing the highest with lowest tertile of TFAs was 1.44 (95% CI, 0.86-2.39) for total TFAs (P for trend 0.15). For each individual type of TFA, the corresponding OR was 1.78 (1.03-3.07) for elaidic acid (P for trend 0.049), 1.23 (0.76-2.00) for linoelaidic acid (P for trend 0.37), 1.19 (0.75-1.87) for palmitelaidic acid (P for trend 0.46), and 1.20 (0.75-1.94) for  (P for trend 0.43).The cross-sectional study design limited causal inferences of the findings.In a nationally representative population, plasma elaidic acid, a major trans fatty acid, was positively associated with depressive symptoms in adults. A positive but non-significant association of depressive symptoms was observed for total TFAs, linolelaidic acid, palmitelaidic acid, and .Copyright © 2019.

Considering the effect of interactions between food and age on metabolism, here we depict the lipid framework of 12 tissues isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats fed standard rodent chow over 1 year, an age below which animals are commonly studied. The aim is to define relevant markers of lipid metabolism influenced by age in performing a fatty acid (FA) and dimethylacetal profile from total lipids. First, our results confirm impregnation of adipose and muscular tissues with medium-chain FA derived from maternal milk during early infancy. Secondly, when animals were switched to standard croquettes, tissues were remarkably enriched in n-6 FA and especially 18:2n-6. This impregnation over time was coupled with a decrease of the desaturation index and correlated with lower activities of hepatic Δ5- and Δ6-desaturases. In parallel, we emphasize the singular status of testis, where 22:5n-6, 24:4n-6, and 24:5n-6 were exceptionally accumulated with growth. Thirdly, 18:1n-7, usually found as a discrete FA, greatly accrued over the course of time, mostly in liver and coupled with Δ9-desaturase expression. Fourthly, skeletal muscle was characterized by a surprising enrichment of 22:6n-3 in adults, which tended to decline in older rats. Finally, plasmalogen-derived dimethylacetals were specifically abundant in brain, erythrocytes, lung, and heart. Most notably, a shift in the fatty aldehyde moiety was observed, especially in brain and erythrocytes, implying that red blood cell analysis could be a good indicator of brain plasmalogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30072152>Link between plasma trans-fatty acid and fatty liver is moderated by adiposity.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rising. This increase may be associated with . It has been suggested that trans-fatty acids (TFAs) play an important role in non-communicable diseases.We examined the link between liver tests, fatty liver index (FLI) and plasma TFAs. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of adiposity on this link.The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) was used to obtain the data on TFAs and liver function biomarkers. We took account of complex NHANES data, masked variance and weighting methodology.Of the 4252 participants, 46.4% were men. The mean age was 50.6 years overall; 51.3 years for men and 49.8 years for women (p = 0.206). In a fully adjusted model (demographic and clinical factors), FLI increased as trans-9-hexadecenoic acid and trans- levels increased; FLI was 38.1 and 42.3 for the first quarter (Q1) of trans-9-hexadecenoic acid and trans-, respectively, reaching 65.1 and 69.3 for the highest quarters (Q4) (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Multivariable logistic regression showed for all four studied TFAs, the likelihood of NAFLD (determined by FLI) increased with increasing TFAs levels (quartiles) in a stepwise manner (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Based on moderation analysis, a strong impact of body mass index (BMI) on the link between FLI and TFAs was observed.Our results suggest a direct significant association between plasma TFAs, liver tests and NAFLD (assessed by FLI). Furthermore, BMI was shown to mediate this relationship. These findings highlight the importance of avoiding TFAs consumption in order to minimize cardiometabolic risk.Copyright © 2018.

Our previous in vitro studies suggested that ELOVL6 elongated long-chain saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids with chain lengths of 12 to 16 carbons. Here, we describe the generation and phenotypic characterization of Elovl6(-/-) mice. As predicted from the in vitro studies, livers from Elovl6(-/-) mice accumulated palmitic (C16:0) and palmitoleic (C16:1, n-7) fatty acids and contained significantly less stearic (C18:0) and oleic (C18:1, n-9) acids, confirming that ELOVL6 is the only enzyme capable of elongating palmitate (C16:0). Unexpectedly, Elovl6(-/-) mice produced  (C18:1, n-7), the elongated product of palmitoleate (C16:1, n-7), suggesting that palmitoleate (C16:1, n-7) to vaccenate (C18:1, n-7) elongation was not specific to ELOVL6. The only detected consequence of deleting Elovl6(-/-) in mice was that their livers accumulated significantly more triglycerides than wild-type mice when fed a fat-free/high-carbohydrate diet. When mice were fed a high-fat diet or ELOVL6 was deleted in ob/ob mice, the absence of ELOVL6 did not alter the development of , fatty liver, hyperglycemia, or hyperinsulinemia. Combined, these results suggest that palmitoleic (C16:1, n-7) and vaccenic (C18:1, n-7) acids can largely replace the roles of oleic acid (C18:1, n-9) in vivo and that the deletion of ELOVL6 does not protect mice from the development of hepatic steatosis or insulin resistance.Copyright © 2014 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28704429>Effects of coconut oil on glycemia, inflammation, and urogenital microbial parameters in female Ossabaw mini-pigs.</a></h2><p>Forty percent of American women are obese and at risk for type II diabetes, impaired immune function, and altered microbiome diversity, thus impacting overall health. We investigated whether  induced by an excess calorie, high fat diet containing hydrogenated fats, fructose, and coconut oil (HFD) altered glucose homeostasis, peripheral immunity, and urogenital microbial dynamics. We hypothesized that HFD would cause hyperglycemia, increase peripheral inflammation, and alter urogenital microbiota to favor bacterial taxonomy associated with inflammation. We utilized female Ossabaw mini-pigs to model a 'thrifty' metabolic phenotype associated with increased white adipose tissue mass. Pigs were fed HFD (~4570 kcal/pig/day) or lean (~2000 kcal/pig/day) diet for a total of 9 estrous cycles (~6 months). To determine the effect of cycle stage on cytokines and the microbiome, animals had samples collected during cycles 7 and 9 on certain days of the cycle: D1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 18. Vaginal swabs or cervical flushes assessed urogenital microbiota. Systemic fatty acids, insulin, glucose, and cytokines were analyzed. Pig weights and morphometric measurements were taken weekly. Obese pigs had increased body weight, length, heart and belly girth but similar glucose concentrations. Obese pigs had decreased cytokine levels (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-10), arachidonic acid and plasma insulin, but increased levels of . Obese pigs had greater urogenital bacterial diversity, including several taxa known for anti-inflammatory properties. Overall, induction of  did not induce inflammation but shifted the microbial communities within the urogenital tract to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. We postulate that the coconut oil in the HFD oil may have supported normal glucose homeostasis and modulated the immune response, possibly through regulation of microbial community dynamics and fatty acid metabolism. This animal model holds promise for the study of how different types of  and high fat diets may affect metabolism, immune phenotype, and microbial dynamics.</p></html>
