Plasma ammonia concentrations increased to 411 microm within 1 h of the start of infusion of ammonium acetate at 567 mmol/h. The rate constant for ammonia clearance from plasma was 0 x 054/min and the half-life was 12 x 9 min. Infusion at 567 mmol/h for 1 h followed by 1 h without infusion, repeated four times between am- and pm-milking, caused a decrease in feed intake. Compared with sodium acetate, continuous infusion of ammonium acetate at 360 mmol/h throughout an entire 10-h milking interval increased plasma ammonia concentrations to 193 microm and caused a 20% decrease in milk, protein and lactose production with no effect on percentage composition of milk or the yield of milk fat. Arterial concentrations of glucose and non-esterified fatty acids tended to increase; there was no effect on arterial acetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate or triacylglcerol, and branched-chain amino acids, Lys and  decreased. Mammary plasma flow, estimated by assuming 100% uptake/output of +Tyr, was significantly correlated with milk yield. Mammary uptakes of acetate tended to be reduced by hyperammonaemia, but uptakes of other  metabolites and amino acids were not affected. Thus, while an increase in amino acid consumption during hyperammonaemia was apparent from the drop in circulating concentrations of Leu, Ile, Val, Lys and , there was no evidence to support the hypothesis that milk yield is affected by the lower concentrations. An ammonia-induced depression in feed intake may have caused the decrease in milk synthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9263881>A model of scorpion toxin binding to voltage-gated K+ channels.</a></h2><p>Mutational studies have identified part of the S5-S6 loop of voltage-dependent K+ channels (P region) responsible for tetraethylammonium (TEA) block and permeation properties. Several scorpion peptide toxins-charybdotoxin (ChTX), kaliotoxin (KITX), and agitoxin (AgTX)-also block the channel with high affinity and specificity. Here, we examine the interaction predicted when the toxins are docked onto the molecular model of the K+ channel pore that we recently proposed. Docking with the model of the Kv1.3 channel started by location of Lys-27 side chain into the central axis of the pore, followed by  minimization. In the optimal arrangement, Arg-24 of KITX or AgTX forms a hydrogen bond with the Asp-386 carboxyl of one subunit, and Asn-30 is in immediate contact with Asp-386 of the opposing subunit in the tetramer. Toxin residues in proximity to the side chain of Lys-27 (-25, -36, Met-29, and Ser-11 in KITX) interact with the four C-end His-404s. For ChTX the interaction with Asp-386 is reduced, but this is compensated by additional nonbonded interactions formed by Tyr-36 and Arg-34. Comparison of calculated  of interaction of these specific toxin-channel residues with experimental studies reveals good agreement. The similar total calculated  of interaction is consistent with the similar IC50 for Kv1.3 block by KITX and AgTX. Steric contacts of residues in position 380 of the S5-P linker with residues on the upper part of toxins permit reconstruction of the K+ channel outer vestibule walls, which are about 30 A apart and about 9 A high. Molecular modeling shows complementarity of the pore model to toxin spacial structures, and supports the proposal that the N-terminal borders of the P regions surround residues of their C-terminal halves.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8601843>Amino acid pair interchanges at spatially conserved locations.</a></h2><p>Here we study the pattern of amino acid interchanges at spatially, locally conserved regions in globally dissimilar and unrelated proteins. By using a method which completely separates the amino acid sequence from its respective structure, this work addresses the question of which properties of the amino acids are the most crucial for the stability of conserved structural motifs. The proteins are taken from a structurally non-redundant dataset. The spatially conserved substructural motifs are defined as consisting of a "large enough" number of Calpha atoms found to provide a geometric match between two proteins, regardless of the order of the Calpha atoms in the sequence, or of the sequence composition of the substructures. This approach can apply to proteins with little or no sequence similarity but with sufficient structural similarity, and is unique in its ability to handle local, non-topological matches between pairs of dissimilar proteins. The method uses a computer-version based algorithm, the Geometric Hashing. Since the Geometric Hashing ignores sequence information it lends itself to answer the question posed above. The interchanges at geometrically similar positions that have been obtained with our method demonstrate the expected behaviour. Yet, a closer inspection reveals some distant characteristics, as compared with interchanges based upon sequence-order based techniques, or from -contact-based considerations. First, a pronounced division of the amino acids into two classes is displayed: Lys, Glu, Arg, Gln, Asp, Asn, Pro, Gly, , Ser and His on the one hand, and Ile, Val, Leu, , Met, Tyr, Trp, Cys and Ala on the other. These groups further cluster into subgroups: Lys, Glu, Arg, Gln; Asp Asn; Pro, Gly; Ile, Val, Leu, . The other amino acids stand alone. Analysis of the conservation among amino acids indicates proline to be consistently, by far, the most conserved. Next are Asp, Glu, Lys and Gly. Cys is also highly conserved. Interestingly, oppositely charged amino acids are interchanged roughly as frequently as those of the same charge. These observations can be explained in terms of the three-dimensional structures of the proteins. Most of all, there is a clear distinction between residues which prefer to be on the protein surfaces, compared to those frequently buried in the interiors. Analysis of the interchanges indicates their low information content. This, together with the separation into two groups, suggest that the predictive value of the spatial positions of the Calpha+ atoms is not much greater than the sequence alone, aside from their hydrophobicity/hydrophillicity classification.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12699382>An ethylenamine inhibitor binds tightly to both wild type and mutant HIV-1 proteases. Structure and  study.</a></h2><p>An X-ray structure (resolution 2.2 A) of mutant HIV-1 protease (A71V, V82T, I84V) complexed with a newly developed peptidomimetic inhibitor with an ethylenamine isostere Boc--Psi[CH(2)CH(2)NH]--Glu--NH(2), denoted as OE, is described and compared with the complex of wild-type HIV-1 protease with the same inhibitor (resolution 2.5 A). OE shows tight binding to the wild type (K(i) = 1.5 nM) as well as mutant (K(i) = 4.1 nM) protease. The hydrogen bonds formed, in the case of hydroxyethylamine inhibitors, by a hydroxyl group are, in the case of OE inhibitors, replaced by a bifurcated hydrogen bond from the isosteric NH group to both catalytic aspartates Asp 25 and Asp 125. The binding modes of OE inhibitor to the wild type and mutant protease are similar. However, in the mutant protease, weaker van der Waals interactions of the mutated residues Val 84 and Val 184 with OE were found. This lack of interaction  is compensated by a new aromatic hydrogen bond between the phenyl ring of the inhibitor in position P1 and the mutated residue  182.  analysis based on molecular mechanics has been performed to distinguish between the static and dynamic backgrounds of disorder observed at the mutation sites  82, Val 84,  182, and Val 184.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7410430>Allophycocyanin from Nostoc sp. phycobilisomes. Properties and amino acid sequence at the NH2 terminus of the alpha and beta subunits of allophycocyanins I, II, and III.</a></h2><p>Allophycocyanin from Nostoc sp. phycobilisomes was separated into four spectrally distinct components designated allophycocyanin I, B, II, and III by adsorption chromatography on brushite columns. Allophycocyanins I and B had red-shifted fluorescence emission maxima, and on this basis, may function in transfer of excitation  from phycobilisomes to chlorophyll a. Allophycyanins II and III, which together comprise 70% of the total allophycocyanin, have absorption maxima at 648 nm and 650 nm, respectively, and probably transfer excitation  from phycocyanin to allophycocyanins I and B, in addition to serving a structural function. Allophycocyanin I was resolved into alpha, beta, and gamma subunits with apparent molecular weights of 18,000, 17,000, and 35,000, respectively, whereas allophycocyanin B was resolved into two subunits with apparent molecular weights of 16,100 and 15,300, using a modified Weber and Osborn gel electrophoresis system (Brown, A. S., and Troxler, R. F. (1977) Biochem. J. 163, 571-581). In the same gel system, allophycocyanins II and III were each resolved into alpha and beta subunits with apparent molecular weights of 18,000 and 17,000, respectively. The subunits of allophycocyanins I, II, and III were isolated by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography and the amino acid compositions determined. Automated sequence analysis demonstrated that the first 30 amino acids at the NH2 terminus of alpha subunits, and the beta subunits, of allophycocyanins I to III were identical. alpha Subunits: Ser-Ile-Val--Lys-Ser-Ile-Val-Asn-Ala-Asp-Ala-Glu-Ala-Arg-Tyr-Leu-Ser-Pro-Gly -Glu-Leu-Asp-Arg-Ile-Lys-Ser--Val-- beta Subunits: Ala-Gln-Asp-Ala-Ile--Ala-Val-Ile-Asn-Ala-Ala-Asp-Val-Gln-Gly-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Ala--Ala-Leu-Ser-Lys-Leu-Lys-Ala-Tyr- The gamma subunit of allophycocyanin I and both subunits of allophycocyanin B appeared to be blocked at the NH2 terminus, suggesting that the allophycocyanin B subunits may be different gene products than those of allophycocyanins I to III, or if the same, the subunits of allophycocyanin B undergo proteolytic modification after initial synthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20460665>Metabolizable  and standardized ileal digestible amino acid contents of expeller-extracted canola meal fed to broiler chicks.</a></h2><p>An experiment was conducted to determine the standardized ileal digestible amino acid (AA) and AMEn contents of expeller-extracted canola meal (EECM) fed to broiler chicks. One hundred forty-four broiler chicks were divided into 24 groups of 6 birds balanced for BW and fed 4 diets in a completely randomized design (6 groups per diet) from d 14 to 21 of age. The diets were a corn-soybean meal-based basal diet formulated to meet NRC nutrient requirements, the basal diet with - and AA-yielding ingredients replaced by 30% of either solvent-extracted canola meal (SECM) or EECM, and a low-protein casein-cornstarch-based diet. The SECM, which is commonly used in formulating poultry diets, was fed for comparison with EECM, whereas the casein-cornstarch-based diet was fed to estimate basal endogenous AA losses for determining standardized ileal digestibility of AA. All 4 diets contained titanium oxide (0.3%) as an indigestible marker, and nutrient digestibility and retention were determined by the substitution method. From d 19 to 21, excreta samples were collected for AMEn determination. On d 21, the birds were killed by cervical dislocation, and contents of the whole ileum were obtained for determination of AA digestibility. Expeller-extracted canola meal had greater (P<0.05) standardized ileal digestible contents of Gly, Leu, Ser, , Asp, and Glu and tended to have greater (P<0.10) standardized ileal digestible contents of Ile, Lys, , Ala, and Tyr than SECM. Compared with SECM, EECM had greater (P<0.001) AMEn (2,694 vs. 1,801 kcal/kg). The results show that the EECM evaluated in the current study had greater standardized ileal digestible AA and AMEn contents than SECM, and hence, it may be a better source of protein and  for broiler chicks than SECM. The standardized ileal digestible AA and AMEn values of EECM used in the current study could be used when formulating broiler chicken diets using the same to minimize the N excretion and feeding cost.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30005070>Fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs exhibit differences in nutrient composition according to body weight and gestational period.</a></h2><p>Low birth weight may negatively affect  storage and nutrient metabolism, and impair fetal growth and development. We analyzed effects of body weight (BW) and gestational period on nutrient composition in fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs. Fetuses with the lowest BW (LBW), middle BW (MBW), and highest BW (HBW) were collected at days 45, 75, and 110 of gestation. Crude protein (CP), crude fat, amino acid (AA), and fatty acid (FA) concentrations were determined. The BW gain, carcass weight, fat percentage, and uterus weight of sows increased as gestation progressed, as did litter weight, average individual fetal weight, fetal body weight, and dry matter (DM). The concentrations of Ala, Arg, crude fat, Gly, Pro, Tyr, C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:1n9c, C18:2n6c, C18:3n3, C18:3n6, C20:0, C20:3n6, saturated FA (SFA), and monounsaturated FA (MUFA) increased significantly as gestation progressed. The percentage of skeleton, and the ratio of the liver, lung, and stomach to BW decreased as gestation progressed. There were also significant reductions in the concentrations of CP, Asp, Glu, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, , Ser, , essential AA (EAA), acidic AA, C17:0, C20:4n6, C22:6n3, unsaturated FA (UFA), polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), n-3PUFA, n-6PUFA as gestation progressed, and reductions in EAA/total AA (TAA), PUFA/SFA, and n-3/n-6 PUFA. The LBW fetuses exhibited the lowest BW and crude fat, C14:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:2n6c, and MUFA concentrations at days 75 and 110 of gestation. They also exhibited lower Tyr concentration at day 45 of gestation and lower Glu concentration at day 75 of gestation than HBW fetuses. These findings suggest that LBW fetuses exhibit lower amounts of crude fat and several FAs during mid-gestation and late-gestation, which may in turn affect adaptability, growth, and development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29746701>Nitrogen retention, , and amino acid digestibility of wheat bran, without or with multicarbohydrase and phytase supplementation, fed to broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>The study was conducted to determine the effects of multicarbohydrase (MC) preparation (700 U α-galactosidase, 2,200 U galactomannanase, 3,000 U xylanase, and 22,000 U β-glucanase per kg of diet) and phytase (Phy, 500 FTU per kg of diet) supplementation on the nutritive value of wheat bran (WB) in broiler chicks. Trial 1 determined retention of nutrients and apparent metabolizable  corrected by nitrogen (AMEn). One reference diet (RD) protein-free (85% corn based) was fortified to determine the WB nutrient retention coefficient. Trial 2 determined standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of AA, when pancreas and liver were weighed. An additional group of bird was fed with an RD with 5% casein-corn starch diet, fortified with vitamins and minerals to quantify the endogenous fraction and determine SID of AA. For each trial, the test diets were made by mixing RD and WB 7:3 (wt/wt) and fed without or with MC or Phy or combination. Male broilers (Cobb 500), 245 d old, were allocated to five treatments to give seven replicates (seven birds/cage). The birds were fed a commercial diet from day 0 to10 followed by Trial 1 diets from day 11 to 18 and finally Trial 2 diets from day 19 to 21. Excreta samples were collected on days 15-18 and all birds were slaughtered on day 21 for ileal digesta. There was an interaction (P < 0.05) between MC and Phy on retention of DM, N, P, and AMEn. An interaction (P < 0.05) was also observed on SID of Arg, His, Leu, Lys, , , Val, Asp, Cys, Glu, and Ser. Responses of MC plus Phy supplementation were higher (P < 0.05) on overall SID of AA by 6.05% (75.18 to 94.26%), compared with responses for MC (2.35%; 72.04 to 88.97) or Phy (3.46%; 73.27 to 92.13). Liver and pancreas weights were affected (P < 0.05) by the single MC supplementation. The MC and Phy combination may be an effective strategy to improve AA utilization of WB in broiler chickens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15615519>Stereochemical studies of the monocyclic agouti-related protein (103-122) Arg-- residues: conversion of a melanocortin-4 receptor antagonist into an agonist and results in the discovery of a potent and selective melanocortin-1 agonist.</a></h2><p>The agouti-related protein (AGRP) is an endogenous antagonist of the centrally expressed melanocortin receptors. The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) is involved in  homeostasis, food intake, sexual function, and obesity. The endogenous hAGRP protein is 132 amino acids in length, possesses five disulfide bridges at the C-terminus of the molecule, and is expressed in the hypothalamus of the brain. We have previously reported that a monocyclic hAGRP(103-122) peptide is an antagonist at the melanocortin receptors expressed in the brain. Stereochemical inversion from the endogenous l- to d-isomers of single or multiple amino acid modifications in this monocyclic truncated hAGRP sequence resulted in molecules that are converted from melanocortin receptor antagonists into melanocortin receptor agonists. The Asp-Pro-Ala-Ala--Ala-Tyr-cyclo[Cys-Arg-DPhe-DPhe-Asn-Ala--Cys]-Tyr-Ala-Arg-Lys-Leu peptide resulted in a 60 nM melanocortin-1 receptor agonist that is 100-fold selective versus the mMC4R, 1000-fold selective versus the mMC3R, and ca. 180-fold selective versus the mMC5R. In attempts to identify putative ligand-receptor interactions that may be participating in the agonist induced stimulation of the MC4R, selected ligands were docked into a homology molecular model of the mMC4R. These modeling studies have putatively identified hAGRP ligand DArg111-mMC4RAsn115 (TM3) and the hAGRP DPhe113-mMC4RPhe176 (TM4) interactions as important for agonist activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8512070>A continuous fluorescence assay of renin activity.</a></h2><p>A sensitive fluorescence assay that employs a new fluorogenic peptide substrate has been developed to continuously measure the proteolytic activity of human renin. The substrate, DABCYL-gaba-Ile-His-Pro--His-Leu-Val-Ile-His--EDANS, has been designed to incorporate the renin cleavage site that occurs in the N-terminal peptide of human angiotensinogen. The assay relies upon resonance  transfer-mediated, intramolecular fluorescence quenching that occurs in the intact peptide substrate. Efficient fluorescence quenching occurs as a result of favorable energetic overlap of the EDANS excited state and the DABCYL absorption, and the relatively long excited state lifetime of the EDANS fluorophore. Cleavage of the substrate by renin liberates the peptidyl-EDANS fragment from proximity with the DABCYL acceptor, restoring the higher, unattenuated fluorescence of the EDANS moiety. This leads to a time-dependent increase in fluorescence intensity, directly related to the extent of substrate consumed by renin cleavage. The kinetics of renin-catalyzed hydrolysis of this substrate have been shown to be consistent with a simple substrate inhibition model with a substrate Km approximately equal to 1.5 microM at physiological pH; Cleavage of the substrate occurs specifically at the Leu-Val bond and corresponds to the renin cleavage site of angiotensinogen, as reported earlier. In this report, we describe in detail the synthesis of the fluorogenic renin substrate and its application in assays of renin activity. Assay sensitivity has been evaluated by a series of enzyme dilution experiments using the continuous assay format, showing that the assay can detect renin as low as 30 ng/ml after a incubation of only 3-5 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15377624>Effect of level of metabolizable protein on splanchnic flux of amino acids in lactating dairy cows.</a></h2><p>The response of splanchnic tissue metabolism to different levels of metabolizable protein (MP) was measured in 6 catheterized multiparous lactating Holstein cows. Three diets, balanced to provide similar  intakes and increasing amounts of MP (g/d)-1922 (low), 2264 (medium), and 2517 (high)-were fed during 21-d experimental periods according to a replicated Latin square. On d 18, 19, or 20, six hourly blood samples were collected simultaneously from the portal and hepatic veins plus an artery to determine net fluxes of nutrients across the portal-drained viscera and the liver. Yields of milk and protein increased, as did urinary N excretion with increasing MP. Portal absorption of essential amino acids (EAA) increased linearly with increasing MP supply, as did liver removal of His, Met, and . In contrast, liver removal of the branched-chain AA (BCAA) and lysine was unaffected by diets. With increasing MP, the ratio of milk output to postliver supply of BCAA, , and Lys decreased linearly, indicating oxidation of these AA in the peripheral tissues. Concomitant to a decreased catabolism of EAA in the liver (His, Met, , and ) and/or in peripheral tissues (BCAA, Lys, and ), the efficiency of transfer of absorbed EAA into milk protein decreases markedly as protein supply increases. The efficiency of transfer of absorbed AA into milk also varies greatly between AA. These 2 important factors should be taken into account when building predictive schemes for milk protein output.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26045628>[Fe-Fe]-hydrogenase Reactivated by Residue Mutations as Bridging Carbonyl Rearranges: A QM/MM Study.</a></h2><p>In the current work, we found aqueous enzyme phase reaction pathways for the reactivation of the exogenously inhibited [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenases by O, or OH, which metabolizes to HO. We used the hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method to study the reactivation pathways of the exogenously inhibited enzyme matrix. The ONIOM calculations performed on the enzyme agree with experimental results, i.e., wild-type [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenase H-cluster is inhibited by oxygen metabolites. An enzyme spherical region with a radius of 8 Å (from the distal iron, Fe) has been screened for residues that prevent HO from leaving the catalytic site and reactivate the [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenase H-cluster. In the screening process, polar residues were removed, one at a time, and frequency calculations provided the change in the Gibbs'  for the dissociation of water (due to their deletion). When residue deletion resulted in significant Gibbs'  decrease, further residue substitutions have been carried out. Following each substitution, geometry optimization and frequency calculations have been performed to assess the change in the Gibbs'  for the elimination HO. Favorable thermodynamic results have been obtained for both single residue removal (ΔG = -1.6 kcal/mol), single substitution (ΔG = -3.1 kcal/mol), and combined residue substitutions (ΔG = -7.5 kcal/mol). Because the wild-type enzyme has only an endergonic step to overcome, i.e., for HO removal, by eliminating several residues, one at a time, the endergonic step was made to proceed spontaneously. Thus, the most promising residue deletions which enhance HO elimination are ΔArg, Δ, ΔSer, ΔGlu, ΔGlu, and ΔTyr. The thermodynamics and electronic structure analyses show that the bridging carbonyl (CO) of the H-cluster plays a concomitant role in the enzyme inhibition/reactivation. In gas phase, CO shifts towards Fe to compensate for the electron density donated to oxygen upon the elimination of HO. However, this is not possible in the wild-type enzyme because the protein matrix hinders the displacement of CO towards Fe, which leads to enzyme inhibition. However, enzyme reactivation can be achieved by means of appropriate amino acid substitutions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8662895>Ouabain interactions with the H5-H6 hairpin of the Na,K-ATPase reveal a possible inhibition mechanism via the cation binding domain.</a></h2><p>Cardiac glycosides such as ouabain and digoxin specifically inhibit the Na,K-ATPase. Three new residues in the carboxyl half of the Na, K-ATPase, -786, Leu-793 (PFLIF786IIANIPL793PLGT797), and -863 (FTYF863VIM) have been identified as ouabain sensitivity determinants using random mutagenesis. Polymerase chain reaction was utilized to randomly mutate the DNA sequence encoding the amino acids between Lys-691 and Lys-945 in the alpha subunit of the Na, K-ATPase. This region contains four transmembrane segments (H5, H6, H7, and H8) and the connecting extracellular and cytoplasmic loops. Diverse substitutions of these three residues resulted in proteins displaying 2.8-48-fold increases in the I50 of different cardiac glycosides for inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase activity. By locating these residues, in conjunction with -797 (Feng, J., and Lingrel, J. B (1994) Biochemistry 33, 4218-4224), a new region of the protein containing the H5-H6 hairpin and the H7 transmembrane segment emerges as a major determinant of ouabain inhibition. Thus, a link between the cardiac glycoside binding site and the cation transport sites of the Na,K-ATPase transpires giving a structural base to the cation antagonism of ouabain binding. Furthermore, this link suggests a possible mechanism for cardiac glycoside inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase, such that ouabain binding to the implicated region blocks the movement of the H5 and H6 transmembrane domains which may be required for  transduction and cation transport.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22459844>Protein and  intakes affected amino acid concentrations in plasma, muscle, and liver, and cell signaling in the liver of growing dairy calves.</a></h2><p>The nutrient content of and feeding recommendations for milk replacers (MR) vary widely in North America, and acceleration of growth through manipulation of protein and  intakes can reduce rearing costs of dairy operations. The effects of varying the protein and  intake of MR on metabolite concentrations in plasma, liver, and muscle and the phosphorylation activity of protein kinase B (AKT) and ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) cell signals in liver and muscle were assessed. Twenty-four newborn Holstein calves were fed 1 of 4 MR for 9 wk (n=6/treatment): (1) a 20% crude protein (CP), 20% fat MR fed at 441 g of dry matter (DM)/d (CON); (2) a high-protein, medium-fat MR (HPMF; 28% CP, 20% fat) fed at 951 g of DM/d; (3) a high-protein, high-fat MR (HPHF; 27% CP, 28% fat) fed at 951 g of DM/d; and (4) HPHF fed at 1,431 g of DM/d (HPHF+). Water and starter (20% CP, 1.43% fat) were offered ad libitum and calves were fed MR twice daily. Plasma samples were obtained at 1, 5, and 9 wk of age. Calves were not weaned and were slaughtered after the last blood sampling. Liver and muscle tissues were collected and analyzed for metabolite concentrations and cell signaling activity. Calves fed all treatments had lower plasma concentrations of  and Tyr, and a trend for lower Leu, but greater concentrations of  relative to calves fed CON. Calves fed all treatments had increased muscle concentrations of Met and muscle to plasma ratios of , Tyr, and branched-chain amino acids compared with CON. All treatments increased liver to plasma ratios of  and Tyr but diminished the ratios of Met compared with CON. Phosphorylation of protein kinase B was not affected by treatment; however, relative to calves fed HPHF, HPMF and HPHF+ diets increased phosphorylation ratios of ribosomal protein S6 in the liver. Therefore, the changes in plasma and tissue concentrations and plasma to tissue ratios of amino acids were associated with enhanced growth rates. However, cell signaling activity was not consistent with accelerated growth in calves fed treatments with increased contents of  and protein possibly due to confounding effects of diet (MR + starter) or fasting before tissue harvesting.

Mono- and bicyclic peptides with (4-amino)phenylazobenzoic acid as backbone constituent.</a></h2><p>The thioredoxin reductase active-site fragment H-Ala-Cys-Ala--Cys-Asp-Gly--OH [134-141], which is known for its high tendency to assume an almost identical conformation as in the intact enzyme, was backbone cyclized with the photoresponsive (4-amino)phenylazobenzoic acid (APB) to produce a monocyclic and disulfide-bridged bicyclic APB-peptide. Light-induced reversible cis/trans isomerization occurs at identical extents in both the linear and the two cyclic forms. Nuclear magnetic resonance conformational analysis clearly revealed that in the bicyclic APB-peptide both as a trans- and cis-azo-isomer the constraints imparted by the bicyclic structure do not allow the molecule to relax into a defined low  conformation, thus making the molecule a frustrated system that flip-flops between multiple conformational states. Conversely, the monocyclic APB peptide folds into a well-defined lowest  structure as a trans-azo-isomer, which upon photoisomerization to the cis-azo configuration relaxes into a less restricted conformational space. First femtosecond spectroscopic analysis of the dynamics of the photoreaction confirm a fast first phase on the femtosecond time scale related to the cis/trans isomerization of the azobenzene moiety followed by a slower phase in the picosecond time scale that involves an adjustment of the peptide backbone. Due to the well- defined photoresponsive two-state transition of this monocyclic peptide molecule, it represents a model system well suited for studying the ultrafast dynamics of conformational transitions by time-resolved spectroscopy.Copyright 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29505708>Insight into the Aggregation Capacity of Anammox Consortia during Reactor Start-Up.</a></h2><p>Anammox aggregates have been extensively observed in high-efficiency nitrogen-removal reactors, yet the variation and inherent cause of its aggregation capacity related to reactor operation are still unknown. Here, we used microbial detection, metabolomics, extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory, and multivariate statistical analysis to address this issue. The aggregation capacity of anammox consortia varied periodically during reactor operation, which was determined by the hydrophobic force and the ratio of extracellular protein (PN) to extracellular polysaccharides (PS). Fundamentally, it related to the variation of polysaccharides degradation bacteria abundance and the discrepancy of consortia metabolism. Specifically, the distinguishable up-regulation of the amino acids , Leu, Ala, , Gly, Glu, and Val potentially contributed to the high biosynthesis of extracellular PN. Together with the reduced extracellular PS production that was regulated via the uridine diphosphate (UDP)- N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and UDP- N-acetyl-d-galactosamine pathways, the elevated extracellular PN-to-PS ratio resulted in the obviously increased extracellular hydrophobicity and aggregation capacity. Additionally, the overtly enriched phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis pathway was also vital to increasing extracellular hydrophobicity to accelerate aggregation. Understanding aggregation capacity variation is useful for advancing anammox aggregation for its application in wastewater treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19191958>Acrebol, a novel toxic peptaibol produced by an Acremonium exuviarum indoor isolate.</a></h2><p>To identify a toxin and its producer isolated from woody material in a building where the occupants experienced serious ill health symptoms.Hyphal extracts of an indoor fungus, identified as the cycloheximide-tolerant species Acremonium exuviarum, inhibited motility of boar spermatozoa (EC(50) 5 +/- 2 microg of crude solids ml(-1)) and caused cytolysis of murine neuroblastoma cells (MNA) and feline fetal lung cells (FL). The responsible substances were purified and identified as two structurally similar, heat-stable, novel, toxic peptaibols, 1726 Da and 1740 Da, respectively, with amino acid sequences of Acetyl--Iva/Val-Gln-Aib-Ile--Leu-Aib-Pro-Aib-Gln-Pro-Aib-(X-X-X)-SerOH and Acetyl--Iva/Val-Gln-Aib-Ile--Leu-Val-Pro-Aib-Gln-Pro-Aib-(X-X-X)-SerOH. Purified acrebol inhibited motility of boar sperm, depleted ATP half-content in 1 day (EC(50) of 0.1 microg ml(-1), 60 nmol l(-1)) depolarised the mitochondria after 2 days, but did not affect the cellular content in NADH. This indicates mitochondrial toxicity. Plate-grown biomass of A. exuviarum BMB4 contained 0.1-1% (w/w) of acrebol, depending on the culture medium.Acrebol paralysed the  generation of mammalian cells suggesting that mitochondria were its target of action.Acremonium exuviarum, as an indoor fungus, is potentially hazardous to health because of the toxic peptaibols that it produces.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20969427>Sequence composition and environment effects on residue fluctuations in protein structures.</a></h2><p>Structure fluctuations in proteins affect a broad range of cell phenomena, including stability of proteins and their fragments, allosteric transitions, and  transfer. This study presents a statistical-thermodynamic analysis of relationship between the sequence composition and the distribution of residue fluctuations in protein-protein complexes. A one-node-per-residue elastic network model accounting for the nonhomogeneous protein mass distribution and the interatomic interactions through the renormalized inter-residue potential is developed. Two factors, a protein mass distribution and a residue environment, were found to determine the scale of residue fluctuations. Surface residues undergo larger fluctuations than core residues in agreement with experimental observations. Ranking residues over the normalized scale of fluctuations yields a distinct classification of amino acids into three groups: (i) highly fluctuating-Gly, Ala, Ser, Pro, and Asp, (ii) moderately fluctuating-, Asn, Gln, Lys, Glu, Arg, Val, and Cys, and (iii) weakly fluctuating-Ile, Leu, Met, , Tyr, Trp, and His. The structural instability in proteins possibly relates to the high content of the highly fluctuating residues and a deficiency of the weakly fluctuating residues in irregular secondary structure elements (loops), chameleon sequences, and disordered proteins. Strong correlation between residue fluctuations and the sequence composition of protein loops supports this hypothesis. Comparing fluctuations of binding site residues (interface residues) with other surface residues shows that, on average, the interface is more rigid than the rest of the protein surface and Gly, Ala, Ser, Cys, Leu, and Trp have a propensity to form more stable docking patches on the interface. The findings have broad implications for understanding mechanisms of protein association and stability of protein structures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22573843>Triennial Lactation Symposium: Mammary metabolism of amino acids in dairy cows.</a></h2><p>Although in dairy cows the mammary gland (MG) is the major net user of essential AA (EAA) supply, milk protein synthesis from absorbed EAA is not a straightforward process. Early studies identified 2 groups of EAA based on different pattern of mammary utilization: group 1 [Met,  (+Tyr), Trp], where MG uptake was similar to secretion in milk protein, and group 2 (Arg, Ile, Leu, Lys, , and Val), where uptake exceeded milk protein output. This review examines the validity of this classification under variable protein supply through a meta-analysis, with the outcomes then explained with studies in which the fates of individual EAA were monitored using isotope approaches. For the meta-analysis, the Fick principle, based on stoichiometric transfer of +Tyr uptake to milk protein, was used to estimate mammary plasma flow across all studies. This approach was judged acceptable because doubling  supply did not result in mammary oxidation of +Tyr and either limited or no contribution of peptides to  and Tyr mammary supply could be detected. The AA content of proteins synthesized by the MG was estimated from milk protein composition, and the uptake-to-output ratio (U:O) for individual AA was re-calculated based on these assumptions. Analysis of individual samples by isotopic dilution resulted in reduced variance compared with analysis on pooled samples performed with an AA analyzer. Globally, the U:O of His and Met is maintained close to unity under variable protein supply. The group 2 AA could be subdivided. First, the U:O for group "2v" AA (Ile, Leu, Val, and Lys) is greater than 1 and varied with protein supply. Accordingly, the increased U:O of Leu, induced by duodenal casein infusion, led to extra-mammary Leu oxidation. Decreasing Lys supply decreased Lys U:O and the associated transfer of N to non-EAA, mainly to Glx, Asx, Ser, and Ala. Second, the U:O of group "2nv" AA, Arg and , does not vary with protein supply. The Arg U:O averages 2.5, whereas the  U:O, albeit averaging 1.2, does not differ from unity. Excess of both these AA is probably directed toward the synthesis of non-EAA rather than  supply. Overall, the ability of the MG to use excess EAA-N supply offers alternative sources of N and C for  provision, lactose synthesis and non-EAA synthesis. The latter function spares dietary non-EAA for other necessary processes, such as gluconeogenesis and  supply, in other tissues to support lactation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10984402>Photomodulation of conformational states. II. Mono- and bicyclic peptides with (4-aminomethyl)phenylazobenzoic acid as backbone constituent.</a></h2><p>It has been reported that backbone cyclization of octapeptides with the photoresponsive (4-aminomethyl)phenylazobenzoic acid imparts sufficient restraints to induce and stabilize ordered conformations of the peptide backbone in both the cis- and trans-azo-isomers (L. Ulysse, J. Cubillos, and J. Chmielewski, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 1995, Vol. 117, pp. 8466-8467). Correspondingly, the active-site octapeptide fragment H-Ala-Cys-Ala--Cys-Asp-Gly--OH [134-141] of thioredoxin reductase, with its high preference for a 3(10)-helix turn conformation centered on the -Cys sequence, was backbone cyclized with this azobenzene moiety in the attempt to design a photoresponsive system where the conformational states of the peptide backbone are dictated by the configuration of the azobenzene and can be further modulated by the disulfide bridge. Nuclear magnetic resonance conformational analysis of the monocyclic compound clearly revealed the presence of two conformational families in both the cis- and trans-azo configuration. Of the higher populated conformational families, the structure of the trans-isomer seems like a pretzel-like folding, while the cis-isomer relaxes into a significantly less defined conformational state that does not exhibit any regular structural elements. Further restrictions imparted by disulfide bridging of the peptide moiety leads to an even better defined conformation for the trans-azo-isomer, whereas the cis-isomer can be described as a frustrated system without pronounced  minima and thus with little conformational preferences. Our findings would suggest that this photoresponsive peptide template may not be of general usefulness for light-induced conformational transitions between two well-defined conformational states at least under the experimental conditions employed, even in the bicyclic form. However, trans --> cis isomerization of the bicyclic peptide is accompanied by a switch from a well-defined conformation to an ensemble of possible conformations.Copyright 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12169210>Comparative study of some energetic and steric parameters of the wild type and mutants HIV-1 protease: a way to explain the viral resistance.</a></h2><p>Because, in vivo, the HIV-1 PR ( HIV-1 protease) present a high mutation rate we performed a comparative study of the energetic behaviors of the wild type HIV-1 PR and four type of mutants: Val82/Asn; Val82/Asp; Gln7/Lys, Leu33/Ile, Leu63/Ile; Ala71/, Val82/Ala. We suggest that the energetic fluctuation (electrostatic, van der Waals and torsion ) of the mutants and the solvent accessible surface (SAS) values can be useful to explain the viral resistance process developed by HIV-1 PR. The number and localization of enzyme mutations induce important modifications of the van der Waals and torsional , while the electrostatic  has an insignificant fluctuation. We showed that the viral resistance can be explored if the solvent accessible surfaces of the active site for the mutant structures are calculated. In this paper we have obtained the solvent accessible surface for a group of 15 mutants (11 mutants obtained by Protein Data Bank (PDB) file, 4 mutants modeled by CHARMM software) and for the wild type HIV-1 PR).

(1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 15298-15303]. To elucidate the role of Tyr80 in stabilizing the enzyme, the KNTase gene was modified by site-directed mutagenesis so that the codon for Asp80 of the wild type was replaced by that for Ser, , Ala, Val, Leu,  and Trp, respectively. The eight mutant KNTases including Tyr80 were all purified, as well as the wild-type enzyme. The heat-inactivation rate constants were determined at 58 degrees C and the half-life values were found to be correlated with the hydrophobicity of the amino acid residues replaced at the unique position. The Gibbs  change of unfolding in water of KNTase assessed from urea denaturation (25 degrees C, pH 7.0) was also found to be correlated with hydrophobicity. The results suggest that different amino acids at position 80 of KNTase contribute to the stability of the protein by hydrophobic interactions. In the case of tyrosine at position 80 the unusually high stability of the enzyme compared to the Phe80 enzyme suggests that the hydroxyl group also contributes to the conformational stability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30329054>Immune system stimulation induced by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide alters plasma free amino acid flux and dietary nitrogen utilization in growing pigs.</a></h2><p>Changes in plasma free AA flux reflect the modification of AA metabolism in different metabolic states. Immune system stimulation (ISS) in growing pigs may redistribute AA from protein retention towards processes involved in the immune response, thus impacting AA utilization. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of ISS on whole-body nitrogen (N) utilization and the kinetics of plasma free AA. Ten gilts (BW 9.4 ± 1.1 kg) were surgically fitted with jugular vein catheters, individually housed in metabolism crates, and feed-restricted (550 g/d). Repeated intramuscular injections of increasing amounts of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used to induce ISS (30 and 36 µg/kg BW, given 48 h apart). Whole-body N-balance was determined for 3-d before ISS (ISS-) and 3-d during ISS (ISS+). At the end of each N-balance period, a bolus dose of labeled [U-13C, U-15N]-AA mixture (Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, , , Trp, Val, and Gln) was infused intravenously, followed by serial blood collection for determination of isotopic enrichment. A double exponential model was fitted with plasma enrichment data for each pig and each AA, and equation parameters were used to estimate plasma-free AA flux and pool size. Apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of N was determined using the slaughter technique and an indigestible marker. Blood samples were collected before and 76-h after the initiation of ISS and assayed for hematology and blood chemistry. Body temperature (BT) was monitored during the course of study. Blood chemistry, hematology, and BT results indicated that LPS induced effective ISS in pigs (P < 0.05). ISS tended to reduce N retention (P = 0.09) and the N retention-to-N intake ratio (P = 0.08). Apparent total tract digestibility of dietary  and AID of N were reduced by ISS (P < 0.05). Plasma flux (µmol/kg BW/h) for Ile and  was reduced by ISS (P < 0.05). Strong tendencies for decreased Lys flux and N retention were observed in ISS pigs (P < 0.10). ISS increased the pool size for Leu but reduced the pool size for Ile (P < 0.05). Collectively, these results suggest that ISS alters the utilization of dietary N and AA flux, as well as pool size in growing pigs. The decrease in Lys, , and Ile flux during ISS may be attributed to a reduction in whole-body protein synthesis or decreased catabolism of these AA. Relative to other AA, dietary Lys, , and Ile requirements may decrease in ISS pigs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8312239>Comparison of the ileal and faecal digestibility of dietary amino acids in adult humans and evaluation of the pig as a model animal for digestion studies in man.</a></h2><p>The aim of the study was to determine if there is a difference between ileal and faecal assays for determining amino acid and N digestibilities in adult human subjects. Comparison of true ileal amino acid and N digestibilities was also made between adult human subjects and growing pigs to establish the usefulness of the pig as a model animal. Five subjects with established ileostomies and six subjects with intact large bowels consumed a constant diet consisting of meat, vegetables, fruit, bread and dairy products for 7 d with collection of ileostomy contents or faeces respectively over the last 4 d. The study was repeated using 25 kg body weight ileostomized and intact pigs. Apparent amino acid and N digestibility coefficients were determined. For human subjects the faecal digestibility values were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the ileal values for Arg, Asp, Gly, , Pro, Ser,  and Trp. The faecal digestibility of Met was significantly lower than the ileal value. Determination of DNA, diaminopimelic acid (DAPA) and the digestibilities of pectin, hemicellulose and cellulose in human subjects indicated that some microbial colonization had occurred at the terminal ileum after formation of an ileostomy; however, this was not as extensive as in the large intestine. True ileum amino acid and N digestibilities were calculated after correcting for the endogenous contribution of amino acids at the terminal ileum determined using a protein-free diet. There were no significant differences between adult human subjects and pigs for true ileal dietary amino acid digestibility except for , , Cys and Met. There were no significant differences between adult humans and pigs for the ileal digestibility of dry matter and the faecal digestibility of gross .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18339994>Nutritional and physiological effects of dietary sinapic acid (4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxy-cinnamic acid) in broiler chickens and its metabolism in the digestive tract.</a></h2><p>Sinapic acid (SA) is a major free phenolic acid in rapeseed meal, with the majority found in the esterified form of sinapine. Two experiments were conducted to delineate the effect of dietary SA on broiler chickens, in terms of performance, toxicity, and nutrient digestibility. In the first experiment, 80 male broiler chicks were randomly assigned to 5 diets adequate in all nutrients and containing 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, or 0.20% dietary SA. Performance from 0 to 18 d of age and the relative size of all the internal organs and intestines were not affected (all P>0.05) by dietary treatment. In addition, dietary SA had no effect (P>0.05) on the serum activity of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, which indicated that there was no damage to skeletal muscle, heart muscle, liver, kidneys, or brain. The objectives of the second experiment were to investigate the effect of SA on nutrient retention and to study the retention of SA in the digestive tract. Male broiler chicks (96) were randomly assigned into 4 treatments containing dietary SA at 0, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.10%. Dietary SA at the 0.025% level increased feed intake compared with control (P<0.05). Regression analysis indicated a quadratic response for both weight gain and feed intake (P<0.05) as SA increased in the diet. Again, dietary SA did not affect the relative weights of bursa of Fabricius, liver, kidney, or digestive tract. Nitrogen-corrected AME and protein digestibility were not affected by SA level. A negative linear relationship was found between dietary SA level and apparent ileal digestibility of Met, , Ser, Pro, Gly, Ala, and . Sinapic acid disappearance in the ileum was above 97% for all SA levels, whereas apparent SA retention in excreta ranged from 64 to 79%. Sinapic acid at dietary levels investigated in this research is apparently not toxic to broiler chickens but may have a negative effect on amino acid digestibility at higher levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8268807>Application of molecular dynamics and free  perturbation methods to metalloporphyrin-ligand systems II: CO and dioxygen binding to myoglobin.</a></h2><p>The protein contribution to the relative binding affinity of the ligands CO and O2 toward myoglobin (Mb) has been simulated using free  perturbation calculations. The tautomers of the His E7 residue are different for the oxymyoglobin (MbO2) and carboxymyoglobin (MbCO) systems. This was modeled by performing two-step calculations that mutate the ligand and mutate the His E7 tautomers in separate steps. Differences in hydrogen bonding to the O2 and CO ligands were incorporated into the model. The O2 complex was calculated to be 2-3 kcal/mol more stable than the corresponding CO complex when compared to the same difference in an isolated heme control. This value agrees well with the experimental value of 2.0 kcal/mol. In qualitative agreement with experiments, the Fe-C-O bond is found to be bent (theta = 159.8 degrees) with a small tilt (theta = 6.2 degrees). The contributions made by each of the 29 residues--within the 9.0-A radius of the iron atom--to the free  difference are separated into van der Waals and electrostatic contributions; the latter contributions are dominant. Aside from the proximal histidine and the heme group, the residues having the largest difference in free  in mutating MbO2-->MbCO are His E7,  CD1,  CD4, Val E11, and  E10.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17070834>Flight fuel and neuropeptidergic control of fuel mobilisation in the twig wilter, Holopterna alata (Hemiptera, Coreidae).</a></h2><p>The corpus cardiacum of the twig wilter Holopterna alata contains a factor that elicits increases in the concentration of lipids in the haemolymph of twig wilters and migratory locusts and causes hypertrehalosaemia in American cockroaches. A hyperlipaemic neuropeptide was isolated from corpora cardiaca of H. alata in a single high-performance liquid chromatography step. The primary sequence of this peptide was assigned by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry, biological assay and co-elution with the synthetic peptide. The adipokinetic peptide of H. alata is an octapeptide with the sequence pGlu-Leu-Asn--Ser--Gly-Trp amide denoted Schgr-AKH-II which was sequenced previously from the corpora cardiaca of a number of Caelifera, Ensifera and some Hymenoptera. A dose of 1pmol of synthetic Schgr-AKH-II causes a pronounced hyperlipaemic effect in the twig wilter. Physiological experiments with the twig wilter reveal that during flight periods of 3 min, the normally low carbohydrate concentration in the haemolymph is significantly diminished, whereas the lipid concentration stays constant in most cases. During a subsequent rest period of 60 min after a 3 min flight episode, however, the concentration of lipids in the haemolymph increases substantially and significantly, indicating that lipids, too, are a major fuel during flight of twig wilters. This is corroborated by the activation of the enzyme triacylglycerol (TAG) lipase in the fat body, but not in the flight muscles, by injection of 5 pmol of synthetic Schgr-AKH-II, the endogenous adipokinetic hormone that is thought to be released during flight. Moreover, in the thorax there is a significant decrease in the concentration of glycogen and lipids measured after flight plus 60 min of rest compared to non-flown twig wilters, whereas no significant changes were monitored for these substrates stored in the abdomen. When the change in lipid class composition was analysed during flight plus 60 min of rest, TAG which comprised the major class in all compartments analysed (thorax, abdomen, haemolymph) was significantly reduced in abdomen and thorax, and diacylglycerol was significantly increased in all three compartments. From all the data collected, it is concluded that lipids are the major fuel class for flight in H. alata and that the contribution of carbohydrates is minimal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24455879>[Spatial structure of -Pro-Ala-Glu-Asp--Met-Arg--NH2 molecule].</a></h2><p>The spatial structure of cardioactive -Pro-Ala-Glu-Asp--Met-Arg--NH2 molecule has been investigated using a theoretical conformational analysis.

Three members of these group (1) (Xaa = , Yaa = Gln), (2) (Xaa = , Yaa = Ser), and (3) (Xaa = Yaa = Ser) can stimulate the saliva secretion from the separated salivary gland of the Calliphora vomitoria fly, whereas two other calliFMRF-amides (4) (Xaa = Lys, Yaa = Asn) and (5) (Xaa = Ala, Yaa = Gly) are inactive in this biological test. Low- spatial structures of the studied compounds were determined by a conformational analysis. A comparison of the stable structures of the biologically active and inactive neuropeptides revealed a similarity in their conformational properties and allowed determination of the role of separate residues in the peptide folding.

SNF1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is inhibited during growth on high levels of glucose and is activated in response to glucose depletion and other stresses. Activation entails phosphorylation of (210) on the activation loop of the catalytic subunit Snf1 by Snf1-activating kinases. We have used mutational analysis to identify Snf1 residues that are important for regulation. Alteration of Tyr(106) in the αC helix or Leu(198) adjacent to the Asp--Gly motif on the activation loop relieved glucose inhibition of phosphorylation, resulting in phosphorylation of (210) during growth on high levels of glucose. Substitution of Arg for Gly(53), at the N terminus of the kinase domain, increased activation on both high and low glucose. Alteration of the ubiquitin-associated domain revealed a modest autoinhibitory effect. Previous studies identified alterations of the Gal83 (β) and Snf4 (γ) subunits that relieve glucose inhibition, and we have here identified a distinct set of Gal83 residues that are required. Together, these results indicate that alterations at dispersed sites within each subunit of SNF1 cause phosphorylation of the kinase during growth on high levels of glucose. These findings suggest that the conformation of the SNF1 complex is crucial to maintenance of the inactive state during growth on high glucose and that the default state for SNF1 is one in which (210) is phosphorylated and the kinase is active.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20804800>Open conformation of adipokinetic hormone receptor from the malaria mosquito facilitates hormone binding.</a></h2><p>Insect flight requires rapid mobilization of  reserves during flight, which is mediated and regulated by hormonal control via adipokinetic hormones. The structure of the G-protein receptors to which these hormones bind, are crucial in understanding many of the physiological processes in which they play a central role. To date no 3D structure of an insect G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) is available. Here, the first models of the 3D structures of a GPCR from the malaria mosquito are presented. Homology modeling of the receptor identified from the genome of Anopheles gambiae was used to construct two models of the receptor. The 7 transmembrane helical bundles of these two models are based on the crystal structures of beta2-adrenergic receptor and rhodopsin. The flexible loop regions were modeled using high temperature simulated annealing and constrained molecular dynamic simulations. The two receptor models differ in a number of critical features, the most important of which is that the rhodopsin-based model has a 'closed' structure while the beta2-based structure is 'open'. The 'open' conformation provides easy access of the hormone to the binding pocket. Docking calculations with the insect adipokinetic hormones, AKH-1 (pGlu-Leu----Pro-Ala-Trp-NH(2)) from the malaria mosquito and Del-CC (pGlu-Lys-Asn--Ser-Pro-Asn-Trp-Gly-Asn-NH(2)) from the blister beetle showed that while the binding motif of the two is similar, AKH-1 has more than 30 times higher affinity than Del-CC, which strongly suggests that the binding is specific, and that the correct binding site was identified. Using these models it is possible to design antagonists, which block the binding site and are thus species-specific insecticides.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This in turn, is dependent on the adipokinetic hormone, Anoga-HrTH (pGlu-Leu----Pro-Ala-Trp-NH2). No crystal structure of this important neuropeptide is available and hence NMR restrained molecular dynamics was used to investigate its conformational space in aqueous solution and when bound to a membrane surface. The results showed that Anoga-HrTH has an almost cyclic conformation that is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the C-terminus and Thr3. Upon docking of the agonist to its receptor, this H-bond is broken and the molecule adopts a more extended structure. Preliminary AKHR docking calculations give the free  of binding to be -47.30 kJ/mol. There is a close correspondence between the structure of the docked ligand and literature structure-activity studies. Information about the 3D structure and binding mode of Anoga-HrTH to its receptor is vital for the design of suitable mimetics which can act as insecticides.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Small angle X-ray scattering data indicate that PKI(6-22)amide has a compact, rather than extended, structure in solution (Reed J et al., 1989, Biochem J 264:371-380). CD spectroscopic analysis of the PKI peptide led to the suggestion that a beta-turn structure might be located in the -Ala12-Ser-Gly-Arg15-connecting sequence in the middle of the molecule (Reed J, Kinzel V, Cheng HC, Walsh DA, 1987, Biochemistry 26:7641-7647). To investigate this possibility further, conformationally constrained and flexible analogs of PKI(6-22)amide were synthesized and used to study the structure-function relationships of this central portion of the inhibitor. (Des12-14)PKI(6-22) amide exhibited over a 200-fold loss in inhibitory activity. Replacement of the omitted -Ala12-Ser-Gly14-sequence with aminocaprylic acid yielded an analog that regained more than 90% of the lost binding . The D-alanine14 PKI analog was as potent as the parent peptide, whereas the beta-alanine14 and the sarcosine14 analogs were only 10-fold less active. Several peptides that promoted a beta-turn structure at residues 12-15 showed about 200-fold decreases in inhibitory activity. Two constrained analogs that could not assume a beta-turn conformation were only 30-fold less potent than PKI(6-22)amide. Thus, the structure of the central connecting portion of the PKI peptide, encompassing residues 12-15, greatly influences its ability to effectively bind to and inhibit the catalytic subunit. We conclude, however, that a formal beta-turn at this position is not required and is actually detrimental for a high-affinity interaction of PKI(6-22)amide with the enzyme. These results are interpreted in light of the Fourier-transform infrared spectra of the peptide analogs and the crystal structure of the peptide bound at the active site of the protein kinase (Knighton DR et al., 1991b, Science 253:414-420).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19717784>Amino acid digestibility and  concentration in a novel source of high-protein distillers dried grains and their effects on growth performance of pigs.</a></h2><p>Three experiments were conducted to evaluate a novel source of high-protein distillers dried grains produced by Buhler Inc.

The SID of indispensable AA was less (P < 0.01) in HP-DDG(Buhler) than in SBM (Arg, 87.5 vs. 93.9%; His, 76.7 vs. 88.7%; Ile, 76.4 vs. 87.5%; Leu, 77.8 vs. 86.8%; Lys, 75.4 vs. 88.4%; Met, 82.8 vs. 88.4%; , 77.9 vs. 87.3%; , 72.5 vs. 83.5%; Trp, 85.1 vs. 91.0%; Val, 73.3 vs. 84.3%). The DE and ME in HP-DDG(Buhler) and in corn were measured in Exp. 2 using 16 growing barrows (24.6 +/- 1.66 kg of BW). A corn-based diet and a diet containing 50% corn and 48.2% HP-DDG(Buhler) were formulated. The total collection method and the difference procedures were used. The concentrations of DE and ME in HP-DDG(Buhler) were greater (P < 0.001) than in corn (5,043 vs. 4,002 kcal/kg of DM and 4,690 vs. 3,921 kcal/kg of DM, respectively). Experiment 3 was a 9-wk growth assay using 40 pigs (initial BW: 58.2 +/- 2.28 kg) allotted to 5 dietary treatments, with 8 replicates of individually housed pigs per treatment. Treatments included a control diet based on corn and SBM and 4 diets in which HP-DDG(Buhler) replaced 33, 66, 66, or 100% of the SBM in the control diet. All HP-DDG(Buhler) diets contained supplemental Lys and  to provide similar concentrations of SID Lys and  in all diets; one of the diets in which HP-DDG(Buhler) replaced 66% of the SBM and the diet in which HP-DDG(Buhler) replaced 100% of the SBM also contained crystalline Trp. Dietary treatments had no effect on ADG (1.15, 1.13, 1.16, 1.12, and 1.14 kg), ADFI (3.33, 3.35, 3.39, 3.30, and 3.33 kg), or G:F (0.35, 0.34, 0.34, 0.34, and 0.34 kg/kg). Carcass traits of pigs fed the diet in which HP-DDG(Buhler) replaced 100% of the SBM were not different from those of pigs fed the control diet. In conclusion, HP-DDG(Buhler) contains more DE and ME than corn, but has decreased SID values for AA compared with SBM. Soybean meal can be replaced by HP-DDG(Buhler) in diets fed to finishing pigs without any effect on growth performance or carcass characteristics, provided that diets are adequate in indispensable AA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20042596>Structural basis for the association of the redox-sensitive target of rapamycin FATC domain with membrane-mimetic micelles.</a></h2><p>The target of rapamycin (TOR) is a conserved eukaryotic Ser/ kinase that regulates cellular growth in response to the nutrient and  state. TOR signaling plays an important role in the development of diseases such as cancer, obesity, and diabetes and in different redox-sensitive processes (hypoxia, apoptosis, and aging). Because TOR has been detected at different cellular membranes and in the nucleus, its localization may influence the specific signaling readout. To better understand how TOR can associate with different membranes, the lipid-binding properties of the redox-sensitive yeast TOR1 FATC domain (y1fatc) have been characterized by solution NMR spectroscopy. Binding studies with different lipids indicate that y1fatc interacts specifically with a membrane-mimetic environment but appears not to recognize a specific lipid headgroup. In both, the structures of oxidized and reduced micelle-bound y1fatc, residues Ile-2456 to Trp-2470 of the lipid-binding motif form a hydrophobic bulb that has a rim of charged residues. The diffusion constants for both micelle-bound states are consistent with the rotational correlation times from the analysis of the (15)N relaxation data. Based on the K(d) values, the oxidized form (K(d) approximately 0.31 mm) binds dodecyl phosphocholine micelles slightly tighter than the reduced form (K(d) approximately 1.86 mM). Binding studies with y1fatc in which one or both tryptophans (Trp-2466 and Trp-2470) were replaced by alanine suggest that these residues are important for the exact positioning in the membrane and that the other aromatic (His-2462, Tyr-2463, and -2469) and aliphatic residues (Ile-2456, Leu-2459, Ile-2464, and Pro-2468) in the lipid-binding motif contribute significantly to the affinity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20061171>Classical maple syrup urine disease and brain development: principles of management and formula design.</a></h2><p>Branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase deficiency results in complex and volatile metabolic derangements that threaten brain development. Treatment for classical maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) should address this underlying physiology while also protecting children from nutrient deficiencies. Based on a 20-year experience managing 79 patients, we designed a study formula to (1) optimize transport of seven amino acids (Tyr, Trp, His, Met, , Gln, ) that compete with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) for entry into the brain via a common transporter (LAT1), (2) compensate for episodic depletions of glutamine, glutamate, and alanine caused by reverse transamination, and (3) correct deficiencies of omega-3 essential fatty acids, zinc, and selenium widespread among MSUD patients. The formula was enriched with LAT1 amino acid substrates, glutamine, alanine, zinc, selenium, and alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3). Fifteen Old Order Mennonite children were started on study formula between birth and 34 months of age and seen at least monthly in the office. Amino acid levels were checked once weekly and more often during illnesses. All children grew and developed normally over a period of 14-33 months.  demand, leucine tolerance, and protein accretion were tightly linked during periods of normal growth. Rapid shifts to net protein degradation occurred during illnesses. At baseline, most LAT1 substrates varied inversely with plasma leucine, and their calculated rates of brain uptake were 20-68% below normal. Treatment with study formula increased plasma concentrations of LAT1 substrates and normalized their calculated uptakes into the nervous system. Red cell membrane omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and serum zinc and selenium levels increased on study formula. However, selenium and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) levels remained below normal. During the study period, hospitalizations decreased from 0.35 to 0.14 per patient per year. There were 28 hospitalizations managed with MSUD hyperalimentation solution; 86% were precipitated by common infections, especially vomiting and gastroenteritis. The large majority of catabolic illnesses were managed successfully at home using 'sick-day' formula and frequent amino acid monitoring. We conclude that the study formula is safe and effective for the treatment of classical MSUD. In principle, dietary enrichment protects the brain against deficiency of amino acids used for protein accretion, neurotransmitter synthesis, and methyl group transfer. Although the pathophysiology of MSUD can be addressed through rational formula design, this does not replace the need for vigilant clinical monitoring, frequent measurement of the complete amino acid profile, and ongoing dietary adjustments that match nutritional intake to the metabolic demands of growth and illness.Copyright 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The results for neutral side chains with phi, psi angles approximately 180 degrees, approximately 180 degrees in ascending order, to an expected accuracy of +/-10 kJ mol(-)(1), are Asn 326; cystine 330; Asp 332; Gln 334; Trp 337; Arg 340; Lys 340; Met 343; His 344;  344; Tyr 344; Leu 344; Ala 345; Cys 346; Ser 349; Gly 350; Ile 351; Val 352; Glu 354;  357; Pro-cis 358; Pro-trans 369. BDEs calculated at the ROMP2/6-31G//B3LYP/6-31G level exhibit the same trends but are approximately 7 kJ mol(-)(1) higher. All BDEs are smaller than those of typical secondary or tertiary C-H bonds due to the phenomenon of captodative stabilization. The stabilization is reduced by changes in the phi,psi angles. As a result the BDEs increase by about 10 kJ mol(-)(1) in beta-sheet and 40 kJ mol(-)(1) in alpha-helical environments, respectively. In effect the alpha C-H BDEs can be "tuned" from about 345 to 400 kJ mol(-)(1) by adjusting the local environment. Some very significant effects of this are seen in the current literature on H-transfer processes in enzyme mechanisms and in oxidative damage to proteins. These observations are discussed in terms of the findings of the present study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1705441>Hepatocellular transport of cyclosomatostatins: evidence for a carrier system related to the multispecific bile acid transporter.</a></h2><p>The uptake of the cyclopeptide c(--Lys-Trp--D-Pro) (008), an analog of somatostatin with retro sequence, was studied in isolated hepatocytes. 008 is taken up by hepatocytes in a concentration-, time-, - and temperature- dependent manner. Since 008 is hydrophobic, it binds rapidly to liver cells. This is evident by the positive intercept at the gamma-axis in the uptake curves. At higher concentrations, a minor part of the transport occurs by diffusion at a rate of 8.307.10(-6) cm/s. This part of diffusion is measured at 4 degrees C and can be subtracted from the uptake at 37 degrees C resulting in the carrier mediated part of uptake which is saturable. Kinetic parameters for the saturable part of uptake are Km 1.5 microM and Vmax 40.0 pmol/mg per min. The transport is decreased in the absence of oxygen and in the presence of metabolic inhibitors. Uptake is accelerated at temperatures above 20 degrees C. The activation  was determined to be 30.77 kJ/mol. The membrane potential and not a sodium gradient is the main driving force for 008 transport. Cholate (a typical substrate of the multispecific bile acid transporter) and taurocholate are mutual competitive inhibitors of 008 uptake. Phalloidin, antamanide and iodipamide, typical foreign substrates of the transporter, interfere with the uptake of 008. AS 30D ascites hepatoma cells, known to be unable to transport bile acids, phalloidin and iodipamide, are also unfit to transport 008. Interestingly, sulfobromophthalein (BSP) but not rifampicin, both foreign substrates of the bilirubin carrier, inhibits the transport of 008 in a competitive manner.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8075386>Conformation and sweet tastes of L-aspartyl dipeptide methyl esters.</a></h2><p>In order to investigate the conformational preferences to elicit tastes, conformational free  calculations using an empirical potential (ECEPP/2) and the hydration shell model were carried out on the L-aspartyl dipeptide methyl esters, L-(+)HAsp(-)-L-Xaa-OMe, in the hydrated state, where Xaa includes sweet (, Tyr, Met, and Gly), bitter (Ala, Trp, Val, Leu, and Ile), and tasteless (Ser, , and Abu) residues. The refined preferred conformation of the  dipeptide (aspartame) with side chain chi 1/2 conformation g- is g-Fg- in the hydrated state, which is consistent with the structure deduced from 1H-nmr experiments. Irrespective of the Xaa and taste, all the dipeptides have the same conformation for the Asp residue, which is attributable to the hydrogen bond between protonated amino hydrogen and carboxylate oxygen and the favored hydration of the carboxylate group. This implies that the L-aspartyl residue is a necessary factor for the dipeptides to be sweet not a sufficient factor. The computed conformational preferences for sweet, bitter, and tasteless dipeptides in the hydrated state indicate to us that the conformation about the N--C alpha bond of the Xaa residue, i.e., the orientation of the hydrophobic moiety with respect to the AH/B functionalities in the aspartyl moiety, seems to be crucial to elicit the tastes. In addition, the hydrophobicity and the size of the Xaa residue are found to play a major role in determining the tastes. These well accord with the related works reported previously.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25149332>Commercially available avian and mammalian whole prey diet items targeted for consumption by managed exotic and domestic pet felines: true metabolizable  and amino acid digestibility using the precision-fed cecectomized rooster assay.</a></h2><p>Whole prey diets are commonly used in the zoo and home setting for captive exotic and domestic cats, respectively. Despite their increase in popularity, nutrient digestibility of such diets has been poorly studied. In this study, the precision-fed cecectomized rooster assay was used to determine the protein quality and nitrogen-corrected true ME (TMEn) of 17 whole prey samples (mice [1 to 2 , 10 to 13 , 21 to 25 , 30 to 40 , and 150 to 180 d old], rats [1 to 4, 10 to 13, 21 to 25, 32 to 42, and >60 d old], rabbits [stillborn, 30 to 45 d old, and >65 d old], chicken [1 to 3 d old], and quail [1 to 3, 21 to 40, and >60 d old]) and 2 ground poultry-based products (chicken and duck). Amino acid score (AAS) and protein digestibility corrected AAS (PDCAAS) were calculated using the nutrient profile recommendations for domestic cat food as a reference value (AAFCO, 2012). Average individual indispensable AA (IAA) and total IAA (TIAA) digestibility coefficients were variable anddepended on AA (84 to 94% TIAA, 85 to 95% Arg, 87 to 96% His, 82 to 92% Ile, 84 to 94% Leu, 85 to 93% Lys, 89 to 97% Met, 83 to 94% , 80 to 95% , 84 to 94% Trp, and 80 to 93% Val) and sample. For a majority of the whole prey items, AA concentrations were greater than the Association of American Feed Control Officials ( AAFCO: , 2012) domestic cat nutrient profile recommendations for growth and reproduction and adult maintenance; however, some whole prey had AA concentrations below the AAFCO (2012) recommendations: Met + Cys (1.10% DM) in ground duck (1.06% DM) and taurine (Tau; 0.20% DM) in 30-to-45- and >65-d-old rabbits (0.01 and 0.10% DM, respectively), 150-to-180-d-old mice (0.18% DM), and ground duck (0.15% DM). The TMEn (3.76 to 6.44 kcal/g DM) expressed as the percent of GE (i.e., TMEn/GE) ranged from 66 to 85%, demonstrating how variable the digestibility of these items may be and justifying more research in this area. Both Met and Tau are commonly added to commercial pet foods, so supplements are readily available to address potential deficiencies and improve protein quality. A direct comparison of the ME of whole prey items by in vivo feline and rooster experiments is needed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17964530>Identification of amino acid residues participating in the  coupling and proton transport of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) H+-pyrophosphatase.</a></h2><p>The H(+)-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase is a proton pump that hydrolyzes inorganic pyrophosphate. It consists of a single polypeptide with 14-17 transmembrane domains (TMs). We focused on the third quarter region of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) H(+)-pyrophosphatase, which contains a long conserved cytoplasmic loop. We assayed 1520 mutants for pyrophosphate hydrolysis and proton translocation, and selected 34 single-residue substitution mutants with low substrate hydrolysis and proton-pump activities. We also generated 39 site-directed mutant enzymes and assayed their activity. The mutation of 5 residues in TM10 resulted in low -coupling efficiencies, and mutation of conserved residues (409), Val(411), and Gly(414) showed neither hydrolysis nor pumping activity. The mutation of six, five, and four residues in TM11, 12, and 13, respectively, gave a negative effect. (388), (389), and Val(396) in cytoplasmic loop i were essential for efficient H(+) translocation. Ala(436) and Pro(560) in the periplasmic loops were critical for coupling efficiency. These low-efficiency mutants showed dysfunction of the -conversion and/or proton-translocation activity. The  efficiency was increased markedly by the mutation of two and six residues in TM9 and 12, respectively. These results suggest that TM10 is involved in enzyme function, and that TM12 regulate the -conversion efficiency. H(+)-pyrophosphatase might involve dynamic linkage between the hydrophilic loops and TMs through the central half region of the enzyme.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6106477>Conformational  studies of the growth hormone inhibitor, cyclo (Aha-Cys--D-Trp-Lys--Cys).</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20166730>Sequence-specific Ni(II)-dependent peptide bond hydrolysis for protein engineering.

Acta Biochim. Polon. 2006, 53, 721-727 and references therein). Hereby we report the synthesis of a combinatorial library of CH(3)CO-Gly-Ala-(Ser/)-Xaa-His-Zaa-Lys--Leu-NH(2) peptides, where Xaa residues included 17 common alpha-amino acids (except Asp, Glu, and Cys) and Zaa residues included 19 common alpha-amino acids (except Cys). The Ni(II)-dependent hydrolysis at 37 and 45 degrees C of batches of combinatorial peptide mixtures randomized at Zaa was monitored by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The correctness of library-based predictions was confirmed by accurate measurements of hydrolysis rates of seven selected peptides using HPLC. The hydrolysis was strictly limited to the Ala-Ser/ bond in all library and individual peptide experiments. The effects of individual residues on hydrolysis rates were quantified and correlated with physical properties of their side chains according to a model of independent contributions of Xaa and Zaa residues. The principal component analysis calculations demonstrated partial molar side chain volume and the free  of amino acid vaporization for both Xaa and Zaa residues and the amine pK(a) for Zaa residues to be the most significant empirical parameters influencing the hydrolysis rate. Therefore, efficient hydrolysis required bulky and hydrophobic residues at both variable positions Xaa and Zaa, which contributed independently to the hydrolysis rate. This relationship between the peptide sequence and the hydrolysis rate provides a basis for further research, aimed at the elucidation of the reaction mechanism and biotechnological applications of Ni(II)-dependent peptide bond hydrolysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2090647>A simple, continuous fluorometric assay for HIV protease.</a></h2><p>Novel fluorogenic substrates for human immunodeficiency viral protease have been developed based on the principle of fluorescence  transfer.

A total of 118 Yorkshire sows (third through sixth parity) were randomly assigned to dietary treatments from day 90 of gestation until farrowing. Dietary treatments consisted of combinations of 2 standardized ileal digestible (SID) AA levels [14.7 or 20.6 g/d SID Lys, SID Lys and other AA met or exceeded the NRC (2012) recommendations] and 2  levels (28.24 or 33.78 MJ/d intake of NE) in a 2 × 2 factorial design. After parturition, all sows were fed a standard lactation diet. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for parameters on metabolism, redox status, and amino acid profile. The data were analyzed using the generalized linear mixed models to reveal the impact of dietary levels of , AA, and their interaction. Sows with increased intake of AA had greater BW gain (P < 0.01) during late gestation. Furthermore, the BW loss during lactation was increased in sows with increasing intake of  (P < 0.05) or AA (P < 0.05). Sows fed high  had higher total litter birth weights (20.2 kg vs. 18.4 kg, P < 0.05) and shorter duration of farrowing (261 min vs. 215 min, P < 0.05), compared with those fed low , which likely was due to higher (P < 0.05) plasma glucose and lower (P < 0.05) plasma lactate prior to parturition. High AA intake in late gestation increased the ADG of piglets during the following lactation (P < 0.05), and increased the concentrations of plasma urea, and the following AA: Lys, Met, , Val, Ile, Leu, , Asp, Ser, and Arg at farrowing (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the increased intake of  increased total litter weight of newborns and shortened the farrowing duration, which likely was due to improved  status at farrowing. Furthermore, sows with increased intake of AA led to higher growth rate of piglets during the following lactation, accompanying with the increasing levels of plasma urea and amino acids. Therefore, the higher  intake in late gestation appeared to improve litter weight and farrowing duration, while higher AA intake may have positive effect on piglets performance in lactation.© The Author(s) 2019.

Treatments for Exp. 3 were abomasal infusions of 1) CON, 2) 10EAA, 3) -BCAA, 4) 10EAA with Leu removed, 5) 10EAA with Ile removed, and 6) 10EAA with Val removed. All lambs received continuous infusions of acetate and propionate into the rumen and dextrose into the abomasum to supply additional . Periods were 7 d: 3 d for adaptation to abomasally infused treatments and 4 d for fecal and urinary collections. Blood samples were collected 3 h after feeding on d 7. In all 3 experiments, N retention was greater (P < 0.10) for lambs receiving 10EAA vs. CON, demonstrating that the basal AA supply from CON was limiting. Removal of each of the essential AA from 10EAA decreased (P < 0.10) their concentrations in plasma (except for Trp), indicating that 10EAA supplied these AA in excess of the animal's requirement. In Exp. 1, N retention (g/d) decreased (P < 0.10) in response to the removal of Met and , but was not affected by removal of Lys and His from 10EAA. In Exp. 2, N retention decreased (P < 0.10) in response to removal of all 3 branched-chain AA, Arg, and Trp, whereas the removal of  from 10EAA did not affect N retention. In Exp. 3, N retention decreased (P < 0.10) in response to removal of branched-chain AA and Val, but was not affected by the omission of Leu and Ile from 10EAA. The results of this research demonstrated that Met, , Arg, Trp, and Val limited N retention of lambs fed a diet low in ruminally undegradable protein.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2835652>Conformational determinants of high affinity delta receptor binding of opioid peptides.</a></h2><p>Detailed conformational analysis of linear and cyclic delta-selective opioid peptides was performed in conjunction with computer-analyzed receptor binding studies with the aim of determining conformational requirements for high affinity binding of peptides to the delta-receptor. The four linear delta-selective hexapeptides included in this study were: DSLET (Tyr-D-Ser-Gly--Leu-) and its D-Thr2 analog (DTLET) and two t-butyl ether analogs. In one analog an O-t-butyl group replaces the D-Ser2OH and in the other a second O-t-butyl group replaces the D-Thr6OH group as well. This study also includes seven cyclic pentapeptides of the type: Tyr-Cys(Pen-Gly--Cys(Pen) with various combinations of DL-cysteine and DL-penicillamine (beta-dimethyl cysteine) as the second and fifth residues resulting in varying delta affinities and selectivities. Four (DPLPE, DPDPE, DPLCE, and DCLPE) have both high delta affinity and selectivity; two (DCDCE and DCLCE) have high affinity at both delta- and mu-receptors, and one (LCLCE) has low affinity for both receptors. Our investigation has shown that all analogs that have high affinity at the delta receptor have a unique common low  conformer. This compact conformer contains intramolecular H-bonds and is very different from the beta II-turn-type structure associated with high affinity mu-receptor binding deduced in our previous work.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12147362>Aromatic residues in the C-terminal region of glutathione transferase A1-1 influence rate-determining steps in the catalytic mechanism.</a></h2><p>Human glutathione transferase A1-1 (GST A1-1) has a flexible C-terminal segment that forms a helix (alpha9) closing the active site upon binding of glutathione and a small electrophilic substrate such as 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). In the absence of active-site ligands, the C-terminal segment is not fixed in one position and is not detectable in the crystal structure. A key residue in the alpha9-helix is  220, which can interact with both the enzyme-bound glutathione and the second substrate, and possibly guide the reactants into the transition state. Mutation of  220 into Ala and  was shown to reduce the catalytic efficiency of GST A1-1. The mutation of an additional residue,  222, caused further decrease in activity. The presence of a viscosogen in the reaction medium decreased the kinetic parameters k(cat) and k(cat)/K(m) for the conjugation of CDNB catalyzed by wild-type GST A1-1, in agreement with the view that product release is rate limiting for the substrate-saturated enzyme. The mutations cause a decrease of the viscosity dependence of both kinetic parameters, indicating that the motion of the alpha9-helix is linked to catalysis in wild-type GST A1-1. The isomerization reaction with the alternative substrate Delta(5)-androstene-3,17-dione (AD) is affected in a similar manner by the viscosogens. The transition state  of the isomerization reaction, like that of the CDNB conjugation, is lowered by  220 as indicated by the effects of the mutations on k(cat)/K(m). The results demonstrate that  220 and  222, in the dynamic C-terminal segment, influence rate-determining steps in the catalytic mechanism of both the substitution and the isomerization reactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24706971>Dietary electrolyte balance influences ileal endogenous amino acid losses in broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of nitrogen-free diets formulated with 2 ratios of corn starch and dextrose and 2 levels of dietary electrolyte balance (DEB; calculated as Na + K - Cl(-), in mEq/kg of diet) on ileal endogenous amino acid (EAA) losses in 48-d-old broiler chickens. On d 43, 240 broiler chickens were allotted to 4 dietary treatments with 6 replicate cages per diet in a completely randomized design. Each experimental diet was fed for 5 d (d 43-48). All diets were free of nitrogen with 2 ratios of corn starch-to-dextrose (0.31 and 1.04) and 2 levels of DEB (108 and 219 mEq/kg of diet). Final BW and BW loss between birds fed the 2 corn starch-to-dextrose ratios and between birds fed 2 levels of DEB were not different (P > 0.05). Birds fed the diet containing a high level of DEB consumed less (P < 0.05) feed than birds on the low-DEB diet. Birds on the high-corn starch-to-dextrose (1.04) diet showed a tendency for higher (P = 0.08) feed intake. High dietary dextrose level (corn starch-to-dextrose ratio of 0.31) resulted in higher (P < 0.05) ileal DM and  digestibility. A high level of DEB resulted in higher (P < 0.05) ileal endogenous nitrogen loss. Arginine, Ile, Leu, , Val, Ala, Glu, Gly, Pro, and Tyr secretion into the gut increased (P ≤ 0.05) with an increasing level of DEB. Endogenous His, Lys, , Asp, Cys, and Ser showed a tendency for increased (P ≤ 0.1) losses with a high level of DEB. Mean ileal EAA losses for the indispensable and dispensable amino acids for the low-DEB diet were 81 and 82%, respectively, that of the birds fed the high-DEB diet. The 4 amino acids with the lowest endogenous flow were Met, His, Tyr, and Cys, whereas the highest endogenous flow was found in Glu, Asp, Val, and Leu. Data from the current study showed that EAA losses in the ileum of broiler chickens are significantly affected by DEB, but not by the ratio of corn starch to dextrose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18261971>Development of sensitive cathepsin G fluorogenic substrate using combinatorial chemistry methods.</a></h2><p>In the current work, a synthesis of new sensitive fluorescence substrates of cathepsin G is reported. The substrate sequence was selected using combinatorial chemistry methods. The starting structure of chromogenic cathepsin G substrate Ac--Val--Gnf-ANB-NH(2), where Gnf stands for 4-guanidine-l-phenylalanine, was modified by replacing the acetyl moiety with a residue of 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl acetic acid (Mca) that served as a fluorescence donor. An amide of amino benzoic acid (ANB-NH(2)) was used as an acceptor. This peptide, exhibiting effective fluorescence resonance  transfer (FRET) phenomena, was used as a starting structure to construct the library Mca--Val--Gnf-X(1)-X(2)-ANB-NH(2), where in both variable X positions all proteinogenic amino acid residues except Cys were introduced. Deconvolution of such a library, performed by the iterative method in solution, revealed prime site preferences of cathepsin G. Finally, the most susceptible sequence, Mca--Val--Gnf-Ser-Trp-ANB-NH(2), was selected. The determined value of the specificity constant (k(cat)/K(M) = 252 x 10(3)M(-1)xs(-1)) was two orders of magnitude higher than that obtained for the parent compound. By the use of this substrate, we were able to detect as little as 70 pM of the enzyme studied.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9129165>Molecular modelling of CYP2E1 enzymes from rat, mouse and man: an explanation for species differences in butadiene metabolism and potential carcinogenicity, and rationalization of CYP2E substrate specificity.</a></h2><p>Molecular modelling of substrates of cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1) within the putative active site region of CYP2E1 constructed from the CYP102 crystal structure is reported. Structural characteristics of CYP2E1 substrates, such as molecular size,  levels and polarity, calculated via molecular orbital procedures provide correlations with toxicity and carcinogenicity; and species differences in CYP2E1-mediated metabolism are rationalized in terms of interactions with putative active site amino acid residues, including -437 and -181. In particular, the activation of buta-1,3-diene can be explained by active site modelling with CYP2E1 enzymes sequenced from rat, mouse and man, where there is a non-conservative change T437H between rodent and human isozymes, together with a conservative change I438V between mouse and rat CYP2E1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24315641>Phenylalanine to leucine point mutation in oxyanion hole improved catalytic efficiency of Lip12 from Yarrowia lipolytica.</a></h2><p>In lipases, oxyanion hole has crucial role in the stabilisation of enzyme-substrate complex. Majority of lipases from Yarrowia lipolytica consist of two oxyanion hole residues viz.;  and Leu. However, Lip12 has  instead of Leu at second oxyanion hole residue. It was observed that Lip12 has lower specific activity and catalytic efficiency than other lipases of Yarrowia. In silico analysis of  to Leu mutation revealed improved binding  of Lip12 for p-np palmitate. This was validated by Phe148 to Leu point mutation where, specific activity of mutant was 401U/mg on olive oil, which was two fold higher in comparison to wild-type. Kcat, remained unaltered, while decrease in Km was predominant for all the substrates used in the study. Improved catalytic efficiency of mutant was a function of chain length in case of p-np esters, with 73% improvement for p-np stearate. However, hydrolysis of triacylglycerides improved by 20%, irrespective of chain length. Decrease in activation  for all the substrates, was observed in mutant in comparison to wild-type, indicating better stabilisation of transition state complex. Further, unaltered differential activation  for mutant depicts that substrate specificity of enzyme remained same after mutation.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to determine whether and how mice respond to deprivation of individual EAA species.Dietary deprivation of any single EAA (not non-EAA) in mice led to progressive weight loss in the order of Ile(-) > Val(-) > (-) > Leu(-) > Trp(-) > His(-) > (-) > Met(-) > Lys(-) , which correlated with the reduction in food intake. Decreased levels of the deprived EAAs as well as increased levels of all or some of the other amino acids were detected in the serum, although these levels differed among the diets examined. Serum biochemistry identified significant increases in creatine phosphokinase, blood urea nitrogen, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase, and decreases in glucose and triglycerides; computed tomography revealed a marked reduction in abdominal/femoral fat and muscle depots; histology identified diffuse myofiber atrophy in the rectus femoris muscle, all in that approximate order. In contrast, amino acid response, autophagy, and ubiquitination marker genes as well as amino acid transporter genes were induced in both deprived EAA-specific and tissue-specific manners.Dietary deprivation of individual EAAs induced systemic adaptive responses that differed in magnitude and molecular machinery.© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Without prior isolation, the structural determination is achieved on the basis of mass fragmentation pattern and comparison with the previously established data. The ESI-MS of the fraction in the positive ion mode gave clusters of singly and doubly charged molecular ion peaks. The ESI-MS spectrum showed peaks for the presence of the peptides kahalalides F, G, R and S reported earlier. In addition, it also showed molecular ion peaks at m/z 1557.8 [M+H] and doubly charged ions at m/z 779.4 [M+2H], 790.4 [M+Na] and 796.4 [M+K]. The MS/MS at m/z 779.4 [M+2H] at collision  40 V obtained series of b and y fragment ions. The MS/MS spectrum showed identical fragment ion y at m/z 643 which revealed that cyclic part is identical with kahalalide F, R and S. Careful examination of the fragment ions b to b with their corresponding y fragment ions y to y, respectively and by comparison of MS/MS pattern of kahalalide S, established that proline can be replaced by tyrosine amino acid residue. The mass difference between b ( m/z 511) and b ( m/z 674) is equal to 163 which is equivalent to mass residue of tyrosine. Their y fragment ions also quickly helped in fixing the puzzle. This resulted in the identification of the peptide sequence cyclo-[Val-(5-MeHex-Val--Val-Val-Tyr-Lys-Ile)-Ile-Val--Dhb)] for the new cyclodepsipeptide, kahalalide Z.

The modeling studies have revealed the two possible mode of RCy-Cytc(4) complexation involving nearly the same stabilization  approximately -15 x 10(3) kJ/mol, one through N-terminal Asp 15 and another -C terminal Glu 121 of Cytc(4) with the Cu-bonded His 143 of RCy. The Asp 15:His 143 associated complex (DH) of Cytc(4)-RCy was stabilized by the intermolecular H-bonds of the carboxyl oxygen atoms O(delta1) and O(delta2) of Asp 15 with the Nepsilon-atom of His 143 and O(b) atoms of Ala 8 and Asp 5 (of Cytc(4)) with the  146 and  51 (of RCy). But the other Glu 121:His 143 associated complex (EH) of Cytc(4)-RCy was stabilized by the H-bonding interaction of the oxygen atoms O(epsilon1) and O(epsilon2) of Glu 121 with the Nepsilon and Ogamma atoms of His 143 and  146 of RCy. The six water molecules were present in the binding region of the two proteins in the  minimized autosolvated DH and EH-complexes. The MD studies also revealed the presence of six interacting water molecules at the binding region between the two proteins in both the complexes. Several residues Gly 82 and 84, His 143 (RCy) were participated through the water mediated (W 389, W 430, W 413, W 431, W 373, and W 478) interaction with the Asp 15, Ile 82, and 62, Tyr 63 (Cytc(4)) in DH complex, whereas in EH complex the  51, Asn 80, Tyr 146 (RCy) residues were observed to interact with Asn 108, Met 120, Glu 121 (of Cytc(4)) through the water molecules W 507, W 445, W 401, W 446, and W 440. The direct water mediated (W 478) interaction of His 143 (RCy) to Asp 15 (of Cytc(4)) was observed only in the DH complex but not in EH. These direct and water mediated H-bonding between the two respective proteins and the binding free  with higher interacting buried surface area of the DH complex compare to other EH complex have indicated an alternative possibility of the electron transfer route through the interaction of His 143 of RCy and the N-terminal Asp 15 of Cytc(4).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19507836>Hydration free energies of amino acids: why side chain analog data are not enough.</a></h2><p>Using molecular dynamics based free  simulations, we computed relative solvation free energies for pairs of N-acetyl-methylamide amino acids (Ala-Ser, Val-, -Tyr, Val-Ala, -Ser, -Ala, and Tyr-Ser) and compared the results with the relative solvation free energies of the corresponding pairs of side chain analogs. We observed differences in (relative) solvent affinity DeltaDeltaDeltaA between amino acids and side chain analogs of up to 66% or, in absolute numbers, 4.9 kcal/mol (Ala-Ser). To rationalize these findings, we estimated separately contributions from what we refer to as solvent exclusion and self-solvation. While the former accounts for the reduction in solute-solvent interactions as one part of the solute occludes other parts of the solute, the latter turned out to be the determining contribution for small polar amino acids and could be shown to arise from interactions between the polar backbone and the polar functional group of the respective side chain in the gas phase. Consequently, the solvent affinity of small polar amino acids depends strongly on the backbone conformation. Our results indicate that the still widely used group additivity-solvent exclusion assumption to estimate solvation free energies for large(r) molecules (such as peptides and proteins) from model compound data (such as side chain analogs) is insufficient. To illustrate practical consequences, we compare the explicit solvent results with those of implicit solvent models. While approaches based on the generalized Born model give results in (mostly) good agreement with explicit solvent, approaches relying (primarily) on the group additivity-solvent exclusion assumption fail to reproduce DeltaDeltaDeltaA. Finally, we briefly discuss the implications of our results for hydrophobicity scales.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18599674>Effects of coextrusion of flaxseed and field pea on the digestibility of , ether extract, fatty acids, protein, and amino acids in grower-finisher pigs.</a></h2><p>The objectives of this study were to determine the ileal and total tract digestibility of individual fatty acids, ether extract, , protein, and AA in a mix of flax and field pea (FP) and to determine whether extrusion improves the nutritive value of this mix. Five barrows (23-kg initial BW) fitted with a T-cannula at the distal ileum were fed 5 diets at 3 times the maintenance  requirement according to a 5 x 5 Latin square design: a wheat and soybean meal control diet and 4 diets containing 30% raw or coextruded FP plus 70% control diet and chromic oxide as an indigestible marker. The 4 extrusion treatments included the following: 1) FP0, ground, nonextruded; 2) FP1, single-screw extruded; 3) FP2, twin-screw extruded with low intensity (screw speed 120 rpm; die temperature 110 degrees C; water input 5 kg/h); and 4) FP3, twin-screw extruded with high intensity (300 rpm; 125 degrees C; 11 kg/h). The ether extract concentration was 17.8, 19.6, 17.7, and 17.3% (as fed) in FP0, FP1, FP2, and FP4, respectively. The ADF concentration was 13.2, 11.1, 11.4, and 13.7% (as fed) in FP0, FP1, FP2, and FP4, respectively. After a 7-d acclimation, feces were collected for 2 d, and then ileal digesta was collected for 2 d.  digestibility in the test ingredients was calculated using the difference method. Extrusion of FP did not affect the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) and apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of DM, OM, and CP for grower-finisher pigs. Extrusion increased (P < 0.05) the ATTD of GE and ether extract and the DE content of FP, and the AID of the Arg, Ile, Leu, Lys, , , and Val, and total fatty acids. Extrusion tended to increase (P < 0.10) the AID of linolenic acid. Single-screw extrusion resulted in a greater (P < 0.05) ATTD of GE, OM, ether extract, and DE content of FP and AID of SFA than twin-screw extrusion. Single-screw extrusion resulted in a trend for greater (P < 0.10) AID of linolenic acid and total fatty acids than twin-screw extrusion. Twin-screw extrusion at high intensity resulted in less (P < 0.05) AID of SFA than twin-screw extrusion at low intensity, indicating that equipment and conditions should be carefully controlled for the extrusion of FP. In conclusion, coextrusion of FP increased digestibility of ether extract, fatty acids, , and AA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9754924>Apparent thermodynamic parameters of ligand binding to the cloned rat mu-opioid receptor.</a></h2><p>The apparent thermodynamic parameters of binding of ten ligands to the cloned rat mu-opioid receptor stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were investigated. For every ligand, the Kd or Ki values at 0 degrees C, 12 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C were determined, a van't Hoff plot was generated and deltaH degrees' , deltaS degrees' and -TdeltaS degrees' and deltaG degrees' were calculated. Changes in free  (deltaG degrees') ranged from -10.35 to -15.65 kcal/mol. The binding of sufentanil, ohmefentanyl, diprenorphine and D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg--penicillamineThr-NH2 (CTAP) was endothermic (deltaH degrees' > 0) and driven by an increase in entropy (-TdeltaS degrees' = -13.08 to -18.57 kcal/mol). The binding of naltrexone was exothermic (deltaH degrees' = -12.56 kcal/mol) and essentially enthalpy-driven. The binding of morphine, methadone, pentazocine, [D-Ala2, NMePhe4, Gly-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO) and Tyr-Pro-NMePhe-D-Pro-NH2 (PL017) was exothermic (deltaH degrees' = -3.53 to -9.95 kcal/mol) and occurred with an increase in entropy (-TdeltaS degrees' = -2.48 to -7.92 kcal/mol). Plots of enthalpy versus entropy and enthalpy versus free  were linear, although enthalpy-entropy compensation was not evident. The entropy changes were not correlated with apparent lipophilicity of the compounds. These results suggest that: (1) opioid ligands bind to the mu receptor by specific mechanisms, unrelated to lipid solubility; (2) the mechanism of binding is not universally different for peptide and non-peptide ligands; (3) the nature of binding does not a priori determine intrinsic activity. The results reveal a novel differentiation of opioid ligands into two groups (group 1: ohmefentanyl, sufentanil, diprenorphine, CTAP and PL017; group 2: naltrexone, morphine, methadone, DAMGO, pentazocine), based on two distinct relationships between enthalpy versus free  of binding, the details of which are yet to be elucidated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26739913>A capillary electrophoretic-mass spectrometric method for the assessment of octreotide stability under stress conditions.</a></h2><p>A capillary zone electrophoretic-electrospray ion trap mass spectrometric method has been developed to assess the stability and pathways of degradation of the cancer therapeutic octapeptide, octreotide. As a somatostatin analogue, octreotide contains a single disulphide bond linking Cys(2)-Cys(7) with the structure of NH2-D--[Formula: see text]--OH. Resolution of octreotide from its degradation products was achieved using a capillary zone electrophoretic method with bare fused silica capillaries, a 10mM ammonium formate buffer, pH 3.20, at 25 °C and an applied voltage of 25 kV. An ion trap low energy collision induced dissociation procedure was applied for the characterization of the chemical structures of the degradation products derived from an acidic, alkaline, neutral and thermal solution treatment of octreotide. The results so obtained indicated that linear octreotide degradation products were formed under acidic and alkaline conditions, due to the hydrolysis of a ring amide bond and a hitherto unknown desulfurization of the Cys-Cys disulfide bond, respectively. Degradation under neutral conditions occurred via cleavage of the exocyclic N-((2R,3R)-1,3-dihydroxybutan-2-yl) amide bond which also preceded the ring amide hydrolysis under acidic conditions. The developed method was further successfully applied to assess the kinetics of these octreotide degradations. Overall, this method is suitable for the rapid and precise assessment of the stability and quality control of octreotide as a synthetic peptide-based pharmaceutical product, and has led to the discovery of a new Cys-Cys disulfide degradation pathway.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Six growing barrows (initial BW = 70.3 kg) had a T-cannula installed in the distal ileum and were used in a 6 x 6 Latin square design. A soybean meal cornstarch-based diet and a N-free diet were formulated. Chromic oxide (0.25%; as-fed basis) was included in both diets as an inert marker. Each diet was provided at three different levels of FI. Feed intake level 1 was equal to the estimated  requirement for maintenance of the pigs, whereas levels 2 and 3 were two or three times this amount, respectively. Each experimental period lasted 7 d. The initial 4 d of each period comprised an adaptation period to the experimental diets. On d 5, fecal samples were collected, while ileal digesta were collected during two 10-h periods on d 6 and 7. Between each experimental period, a corn-soybean meal-based diet (16% CP) was fed to all pigs for 7 d. The basal ileal endogenous losses (IAA(end)) of CP and AA were measured for each level of FI from pigs fed the N-free diet. Likewise, the apparent (AID) and standardized (SID) ileal digestibility coefficients for CP and AA in soybean meal were calculated for each level of FI. The total-tract digestibility coefficient of  in the soybean meal-based diet also was calculated. The AID for CP and all indispensable AA except Lys, Met, and  increased (P < or =0.055) as FI increased. The IAA(end) of CP and all AA except Pro decreased linearly (P < 0.05) as FI increased when expressed as g/kg of DMI; however, the total daily IAA(end) increased as FI increased (linear, P < or =0.056) for all AA, except for , , Trp, Val, Cys, Gly, and Ser. The AA composition (% of CP) of endogenous protein was not affected by the level of FI, except for Arg, , Pro, and Ser. As FI increased, the SID decreased linearly (P < 0.04) for CP and all AA, except Arg, Trp, Asp, Pro, and Tyr. The total-tract digestibility of  was not influenced by the FI level. These results demonstrate that the FI level significantly influenced AID, SID, and IAA(end) for CP and AA. Therefore, pigs used to measure AA digestibility coefficients and IAA(end) should be fed at a level that is close to what is used under commercial conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14691219>Effect of the N3 residue on the stability of the alpha-helix.</a></h2><p>N3 is the third position from the N terminus in the alpha-helix with helical backbone dihedral angles.

The dependence of peptide helicity on N3 residue identity has been used to determine a free  scale by analysis with a modified Lifson-Roig helix coil theory that includes a parameter for the N3  (n3).

They have been identified as candidate targets for next-generation insecticides, yet these targets have been relatively poorly exploited for insect control. In this study, we present a pipeline of novel  allatotropin (Manse-AT) antagonist discovery with homology modeling, docking, molecular dynamics simulation and structure-activity relationship. A series of truncated and alanine-replacement analogs of Manse-AT were assayed for the stimulation of juvenile hormone biosynthesis. The minimum sequence required to retain potent biological activity is the -terminal amidated octapeptide Manse-AT (6-13). We identified three residues essential for bioactivity (⁴, Arg6 and ⁸) by assaying alanine-replacement analogs of Manse-AT (6-13). Alanine replacement of other residues resulted in reduced potency but bioactivity was retained. The 3D structure of the receptor (Manse-ATR) was built and the binding pocket was identified. The binding affinities of all the analogs were estimated by calculating the free  of binding. The calculated binding affinities corresponded to the biological activities of the analogs, which supporting our localization of the binding pocket. Then, based on the docking and molecular dynamics studies of Manse-AT (10-13), we described it can act as a potent Manse-AT antagonist. The antagonistic effect on JH biosynthesis of Manse-AT (10-13) validated our hypothesis. The IC value of antagonist Manse-AT (10-13) is 0.9 nM. The structure-activity relationship of antagonist Manse-AT (10-13) was also studied for the further purpose of investigating theoretically the structure factors influencing activity. These data will be useful for the design of new Manse-AT agonist and antagonist as potential pest control agents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12082165>Cold-adaptation mechanism of mutant enzymes of 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase from Thermus thermophilus.</a></h2><p>Random mutagenesis of Thermus thermophilus 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase revealed that a substitution of Val126Met in a hinge region caused a marked increase in specific activity, particularly at low temperatures, although the site is far from the binding residues for 3-isopropylmalate and NAD. To understand the molecular mechanism, residue 126 was substituted with one of eight other residues, Gly, Ala, Ser, , Glu, Leu, Ile or . Circular dichroism analyses revealed a decreased thermal stability of the mutants (Delta T ((1/2))= 0-13 degrees C), indicating structural perturbations caused by steric conflict with surrounding residues having larger side chains. Kinetic parameters, k(cat) and K(m) values for isopropylmalate and NAD, were also affected by the mutation, but the resulting k(cat)/K(m) values were similar to that of the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that the change in the catalytic property is caused by the change in free- level of the Michaelis complex state relative to that of the initial state. The kinetic parameters and activation enthalpy change (Delta H (double dagger)) showed good correlation with the van der Waals volume of residue 126. These results suggested that the artificial cold adaptation (enhancement of k(cat) value at low temperatures) resulted from the destabilization of the ternary complex caused by the increase in the volume of the residue at position 126.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26082885>Substrate specificity of mitochondrial intermediate peptidase analysed by a support-bound peptide library.</a></h2><p>The substrate specificity of recombinant human mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (hMIP) using a synthetic support-bound FRET peptide library is presented. The collected fluorescent beads, which contained the hydrolysed peptides generated by hMIP, were sequenced by Edman degradation. The results showed that this peptidase presents a remarkable preference for polar uncharged residues at P1 and P1' substrate positions: Ser = Gln >  at P1 and Ser >  at P1'. Non-polar residues were frequent at the substrate P3, P2, P2' and P3' positions. Analysis of the predicted MIP processing sites in imported mitochondrial matrix proteins shows these cleavages indeed occur between polar uncharged residues. Previous analysis of these processing sites indicated the importance of positions far from the MIP cleavage site, namely the presence of a hydrophobic residue ( or Leu) at P8 and a polar uncharged residue (Ser or ) at P5. To evaluate this, additional kinetic analyses were carried out, using fluorogenic substrates synthesized based on the processing sites attributed to MIP. The results described here underscore the importance of the P1 and P1' substrate positions for the hydrolytic activity of hMIP. The information presented in this work will help in the design of new substrate-based inhibitors for this peptidase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8289284>Determination of alpha-helix propensity within the context of a folded protein. Sites 44 and 131 in bacteriophage T4 lysozyme.</a></h2><p>To determine the effects of different amino acids on the structure and stability of an alpha-helix in the context of a globular protein, all 19 naturally-occurring amino acids were substituted for Ser44 in phage T4 lysozyme. A more restricted set of nine replacements was also made for Val131. Ser44 and Val131 are two of a very limited number of possible sites in T4 lysozyme that are well within alpha-helices, are solvent-exposed and relatively free of interactions with neighboring residues, and are not involved in crystal contacts. High resolution structures for the majority of the mutants, some of which crystallized non-isomorphously with wild-type, were determined. With the exception of proline, the amino acid substitutions caused little if any perturbation of the alpha-helix backbone. Also the beta-branched residues , Val and Ile show no indication of either side-chain or backbone distortion. Therefore, other than proline, there is no evidence that differences in helix propensities are associated with different amounts of strain introduced into the helix. For reference, and also to allow estimates of side-chain entropy, a survey was made of side-chain conformations in 100 well-refined protein structures. As noted previously all side-chains within alpha-helices strongly avoid the g- conformation (chi 1 approximately 60 degrees). This restricts the beta-branched residues , Val and Ile to a single conformer (g+, chi 1 approximately -60 degrees). Asp, Asn, Met and Ser within helices also overwhelmingly prefer the g+ conformation. For Arg, Cys, Gln, Glu, Leu and Lys the t (chi 1 approximately 180 degrees) and g+ conformers are populated roughly equally. Only the aromatic residues, His, Tyr, Trp and  prefer the t conformation. These preferences are the same whether the side-chain is buried or solvent-exposed. In general, the side-chain conformations adopted by the residues substituted at positions 44 and 131 correspond to the most commonly observed conformation for the same amino acid in helices in known protein structures. The changes in protein stability for the replacements at site 131 in general agree well with those at site 44 (correlation r = 0.97), suggesting that these may be representative of substitutions at fully solvent-exposed sites in the middle of alpha-helices. The free  values also agree quite well with those observed for equivalent replacements in a number of soluble alpha-helical model peptides and with data from "host-guest" studies and statistical surveys (r = 0.69 to 0.93).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3692682>Comparison of conformational properties of linear and cyclic delta selective opioid ligands DTLET (Tyr-D X -Gly--Leu-) and DPLPE (Tyr-c[D X Pen-Gly--Pen]) by 1H n.m.r. spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>The preferential conformations of the delta selective opioid peptides DPLPE (Tyr-c[D X Pen-Gly--Pen]) and DTLET (Tyr-D X -Gly--Leu-) were studied by 400 MHz 1H n.m.r. spectroscopy in DMSO-d6 solution. In neutral conditions, the weak NH temperature coefficients of the C-terminal residue (Pen5 or Thr6), associated with interproton NH-NH and alpha-NH NOE's (ROESY experiments), indicated large analogies between the backbone folding tendency of both the linear and cyclic peptides. Various gamma and/or beta turns may account for these experimental data. A similar orientation of the N-terminal tyrosine related to the folded backbones is observed for the two agonists, with a probable gamma turn around the amino acid in position 2. Finally, a short distance, about 10 A, between Tyr and  side chains and identical structural roles for threonyl and penicillamino residues are proposed for both peptides. These results suggest the occurrence of similar conformers in solution for the constrained peptide DPLPE and the flexible hexapeptide DTLET. Therefore, it may be hypothesized that the enhanced delta selectivity of DPLPE is related to a very large conformational expense of  needed to interact with the mu opioid receptor, a feature not encountered in the case of DTLET. These findings might allow peptides to be designed retaining a high affinity for delta opioid receptors associated with a very low cross-reactivity with mu binding sites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18487312>Molecular dynamics simulation of Kv channel voltage sensor helix in a lipid membrane with applied electric field.</a></h2><p>In this article, we present the results of the molecular dynamics simulations of amphiphilic helix peptides of 13 amino-acid residues, placed at the lipid-water interface of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers. The peptides are identical with, or are derivatives of, the N-terminal segment of the S4 helix of voltage-dependent K channel KvAP, containing four voltage-sensing arginine residues (R1-R4). Upon changing the direction of the externally applied electric field, the tilt angle of the wild-type peptide changes relative to the lipid-water interface, with the N-terminus heading up with an outward electric field. These movements were not observed using an octane membrane in place of the dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine membrane, and were markedly suppressed by 1), substituting  located one residue before the first arginine (R1) with a hydrophilic residue (Ser, ); or 2), changing the periodicity rule of Rs from at-every-third to at-every-fourth position; or 3), replacing R1 with a lysine residue (K). These and other findings suggest that the voltage-dependent movement requires deep positioning of Rs when the resting (inward) electric field is present. Later, we performed simulations of the voltage sensor domain (S1-S4) of Kv1.2 channel. In simulations with a strong electric field (0.1 V/nm or above) and positional restraints on the S1 and S2 helices, S4 movement was observed consisting of displacement along the S4 helix axis and a screwlike axial rotation. Gating-charge-carrying Rs were observed to make serial interactions with E183 in S1 and E226 in S2, in the outer water crevice. A 30-ns-backward simulation started from the open-state model gave rise to a structure similar to the recent resting-state model, with S4 moving vertically approximately 6.7 A. The  landscape around the movement of S4 appears very ragged due to salt bridges formed between gating-charge-carrying residues and negatively charged residues of S1, S2, and S3 helices. Overall, features of S3 and S4 movements are consistent with the recent helical-screw model. Both forward and backward simulations show the presence of at least two stable intermediate structures in which R2 and R3 form salt bridges with E183 or E226, respectively. These structures are the candidates for the states postulated in previous gating kinetic models, such as the Zagotta-Hoshi-Aldrich model, to account for more than one transition step per subunit for activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11802730>HIV-1 protease: characterization of a catalytically competent enzyme-substrate intermediate.</a></h2><p>The steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic parameters for the interaction of E with the fluorogenic substrate 2-aminobenzoyl--Ile-Nle-(p-NO(2))-Gln-Arg-NH(2) were determined in 1.25 M NaCl, 0.1 M MES-TRIS at pH 6.0 at 25 degrees C. At low concentrations of enzyme, the values of the K(m) and k(cat) calculated from steady-state data were 2.1 microM and 7.4 s(-1), respectively. At high concentrations of enzyme, the time-courses of fluorescence enhancement associated with catalysis were very dependent on the excitation wavelength used to monitor the reaction. Because the absorbance spectrum of the substrate overlapped the fluorescence emission spectrum of the enzyme, these abnormalities were attributed to fluorescence  transfer between the enzyme and the substrate in an enzyme-substrate intermediate. The kinetic data collected with lambda(ex) = 280 nm and lambda(em) > 435 nm were analyzed according to the following mechanism in which EX was the species with enhanced fluorescence relative to substrate or products: [formula see text]. The values of the kinetic parameters with (1)H(2)O as the solvent were K = 13 microM, k(2) = 150 s(-1), k(-2) = 25 s(-1), and k(3) = 11 s(-1). The values of the kinetic parameters with (2)H(2)O as the solvent were K = 13 microM, k(2) = 210 s(-1), k(-2) = 12 s(-1), and k(3) = 4.4 s(-1). These values yielded solvent isotope effects of 2 on k(cat) and 0.9 on k(cat)/K(m). From analysis of the complete time-course of the fluorescence change (lambda(ex) = 280 nm and lambda(em) > 435 nm) during the course of substrate hydrolysis, the intermediate EX was determined to be 6.3-fold more fluorescent than the product, which, in turn, was 4.5-fold more fluorescent than ES or S. Rapid quench experiments with 2 N HCl as the quenching reagent confirmed that EX was a complex between enzyme and substrate. Consequently, the small burst in fluorescence observed when monitoring with lambda(ex) = 340 nm (0.3 product equiv per enzyme equivalent) was attributed to the fluorescence change upon transfer of substrate from an aqueous environment to a nonaqueous environment in the enzyme. These results were consistent with carbon-nitrogen bond cleavage being the major contributor to k(cat).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10691683>Opiate aromatic pharmacophore structure-activity relationships in CTAP analogues determined by topographical bias, two-dimensional NMR, and biological activity assays.</a></h2><p>Topographically constrained analogues of the highly mu-opioid-receptor-selective antagonist CTAP (H-D--c[Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg--Pen]--NH(2), 1) were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis. Replacement of the D- residue with conformationally biased beta-methyl derivatives of phenylalanine or tryptophan (2R,3R; 2R,3S; 2S,3R; 2S,3S) yielded peptides that displayed widely varying types of biological activities. In an effort to correlate the observed biological activities of these analogues with their structures, two-dimensional (1)H NMR and molecular modeling was performed. Unlike the parent (1), which is essentially a pure mu antagonist with weak delta agonist activities in the MVD bioassay, the diastereomeric beta-MePhe(1)-containing peptides exhibited simultaneous delta agonism and mu antagonism by the (2R,3R)-containing isomer 2; mu antagonism by the (2R,3S)-containing isomer 3; weak mu agonism by the (2S,3R)-containing isomer 4; and delta agonism by the (2S,3S)-containing isomer 5. Incorporation of beta-MeTrp isomers into position 1 led to peptides that were mu antagonists (2R,3R), 8; (2R,3S), 9, or essentially inactive (<10%) in the MVD and GPI assays (2S,3R), 10; (2S,3S), 11. Interestingly, in vivo antinociceptive activity was predicted by neither MVD nor GPI bioactivity. When D-Trp was incorporated in position 1, the result (7) is a partial, yet relatively potent mu agonist which also displayed weak delta agonist activity. Molecular modeling based on 2D NMR revealed that low  conformers of peptides with similar biological activities had similar aromatic pharmacophore orientations and interaromatic distances. Peptides that exhibit mu antagonism have interaromatic distances of 7.0-7.9 A and have their amino terminal aromatic moiety pointing in a direction opposite to the direction that the amino terminus points. Peptides with delta opioid activity displayed an interaromatic distance of <7 A and had their amino terminal aromatic moiety pointing in the same direction as the amino terminus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17106110>Evaluation of various sources of corn dried distillers grains plus solubles for lactating dairy cattle.</a></h2><p>The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of feeding dried distillers grains plus solubles (DDGS) from different sources on milk production and composition in dairy cows. Eight multiparous and 4 primiparous Holstein cows were used in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square design with 28-d periods. Treatments consisted of total mixed diets containing no DDGS (CON), or DDGS from source 1 (DDGS-1), source 2 (DDGS-2), or source 3 (DDGS-3) at 20% of diet dry matter. The processing of DDGS-2 and DDGS-3 was intended to decrease heat damage and improve nutritional quality. The DDGS in the diets replaced a portion of the ground corn and soybean meal, allowing them to be isonitrogenous at 16% crude protein. All diets had a forage-to-concentrate ratio of 55:45. Dry matter intake (21.4 kg/d) did not differ among diets, but cows fed diets containing DDGS had greater yields of milk (34.6 vs. 31.2 kg/d), 4% fat-corrected milk (32.7 vs. 29.6 kg/d), and -corrected milk (35.4 vs. 32.3) compared with cows fed the CON diet. Feed efficiency was greater in cows fed DDGS compared with CON (1.78 vs. 1.63). Milk fat yield was greater in cows fed DDGS compared with those fed CON (1.26 vs. 1.14 kg/d). Milk protein percentages (3.28, 3.13, 3.19, and 3.17% for CON, DDGS-1, DDGS-2, and DDGS-3, respectively) were greater for CON vs. DDGS and tended to be lower for DDGS-1 than for DDGS-2 and DDGS-3. Milk protein yields tended to be greater for cows fed DDGS than for those fed CON (1.09 vs. 1.02 kg/d). Concentrations of milk urea nitrogen were lower in cows fed DDGS compared with CON (9.36 vs. 10.6 mg/dL). Feeding DDGS decreased arterial plasma concentrations of Arg, Ile, Lys, and  and increased His and Leu compared with CON. Arterial plasma from cows fed DDGS-2 and DDGS-3 had greater concentrations of Ile, Trp, and Val compared with DDGS-1. In all diets, Lys, Met, and  were the first 3 limiting amino acids for protein synthesis with Lys being first limiting in DDGS-1 and DDGS-3 and Met being first limiting for CON and DDGS-2. Inclusion of DDGS did not affect the molar proportions of ruminal acetate or propionate compared with CON. Ruminal proportions of butyrate were lower in CON compared with DDGS. Total concentrations of VFA were greater in CON compared with DDGS. The concentrations of rumen ammonia were greater in CON (7.2 mg/dL) compared with DDGS (4.5 mg/dL). Overall, the source of DDGS used in this study did not affect lactation performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27188525>Structure-function characterization of the human mitochondrial thiamin pyrophosphate transporter (hMTPPT; SLC25A19): Important roles for Ile(33), Ser(34), Asp(37), His(137) and Lys(291).</a></h2><p>Thiamin plays a critical role in cellular  metabolism. Mammalian cells obtain the vitamin from their surroundings, converted it to thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) in the cytoplasm, followed by uptake of TPP by mitochondria via a carrier-mediated process that involves the MTPPT (product of the SLC25A19 gene). Previous studies have characterized different physiological/biological aspects of the human MTPPT (hMTPPT), but less is known about structural features that are important for its function. Here, we used a protein-docking model ("Phyre2" and "DockingServer") to predict residues that may be important for function (substrate recognition) of the hMTPPT; we also examined the role of conserved positively-charged residues predicted ("PRALINE") to be in the trans-membrane domains (TMDs) in uptake of the negatively-charged TPP. Among the six residues predicted by the docking model (i.e., (29), Arg(30), Ile(33), Ser(34), Asp(37) and (298)), only Ile(33), Ser(34) and Asp(37) were found to be critical for function. While no change in translational efficiency/protein stability of the Ser(34) mutant was observed, both the Ile(33) and Asp(37) mutants showed a decrease in this parameter(s); there was also a decrease in the expression of the latter two mutants in mitochondria. A need for a polar residue at position 34 of the hMTPPT was evident. Our findings with the positively-charged residues (i.e., His(82), His(137), Lys(231) and Lys(291)) predicted in the TMD showed that His(137) and Lys(291) are important for function (via a role in proper delivery of the protein to mitochondria). These investigations provide important information about the structure-function relationship of the hMTPPT.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

(1991) Biochemistry 30:7425-7437] was docked into the X-ray structure of the enzyme-Ca(2+)-3',5'-pdTp complex [Loll, P.J., Lattman, E.E. (1989) Proteins: Struct., Funct., Genet. 5:183-201] by superimposing the metal ions, taking into account intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effects from assigned aromatic proton resonances of Tyr-85, Tyr-113, and Tyr-115 to proton resonances of the leaving dA moiety of dTdA, and  minimization to relieve small overlaps. The proton resonances of the , Tyr, and Trp residues of the enzyme in the ternary enzyme-La(3+)-dTdA complex were sequence specifically assigned by 2D phase-sensitive NOESY, with and without deuteration of the aromatic protons of the Tyr residues, and by 2D heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation (HMQC) spectroscopy and 3D NOESY-HMQC spectroscopy with 15N labeling. While resonances of most , Tyr and Trp residues were unshifted by the substrate dTdA from those found in the enzyme-La(3+)-3',5'-pdTp complex and the enzyme-Ca(2+)-3',5'-pdTp complex, proton resonances of Tyr-85, Tyr-113, Tyr-115, and -34 were shifted by 0.08 to 0.33 ppm and the 15N resonance of Tyr-113 was shifted by 2.1 ppm by the presence of substrate. The optimized position of enzyme-bound dTdA shows the 5'-dA leaving group to partially overlap the inhibitor, 3',5'-pdTp (in the X-ray structure). The 3'-TMP moiety of dTdA points toward the solvent in a channel defined by Ile-18, Asp-19, -22, Lys-45, and His-46. The phosphate of dTdA is coordinated by the metal, and an adjacent inner sphere water ligand is positioned to donate a hydrogen bond to the general base Glu-43 and to attack the phosphorus with inversion. Arg-35 and Arg-87 donate monodentate hydrogen bonds to different phosphate oxygens of dTdA, with Arg-87 positioned to protonate the leaving 5'-oxygen of dA, thus clarifying the mechanism of hydrolysis. Model building of an additional 5'-dGMP onto the 3'-oxygen of dA placed this third nucleotide onto a surface cleft near residues Glu-80, Asp-83, Lys-84, and Tyr-115 with its 3'-OH group accessible to the solvent, thus defining the size of the substrate binding site as accommodating a trinucleotide.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26706905>Interaction of Quercetin of Onion with Axon Guidance Protein Receptor, NRP-1 Plays Important Role in Cancer Treatment: An In Silico Approach.</a></h2><p>Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein receptor whose distinct sites bind semaphorins and vascular endothelial growth factor family members to mediate the role of these ligands in neuronal axon guidance and angiogenesis, respectively. Similarly, Eph receptors and ephrin ligands play critical roles in various biological functions, and deregulated activation of Eph/ephrin signaling in humans is thought to lead to tumorigenesis. Therefore, in this paper, an attempt was made to elucidate the inhibition potential of nine bioactive compounds from four different native spices of Bangladesh against this couple of receptors via molecular docking study. The molecular docking study was carried out using Vina docking protocol. Finally, the receptor-ligand interaction analysis was carried out using the Discovery Studio Client package. Quercetin and diosgenin of onion showed favorable binding with NRP-1 with low binding  of -7.8 and -7.2 kcal/mol, respectively, in comparison with the control inhibitor (-6.1 kcal/mol). The study suggests that ligand interaction with the residues Asp 48,  44,  77, Tyr 81, Trp29, Ile 143 of NRP-1 and Lys 653,  765, Ser 763,  699, Ile 683 of Eph might be critical for the inhibitory activity of these receptors.

The activity of cyanotriphenylborate (CTB) and picrotoxinin (PTX), the best-studied blockers of the Cl(-) pores, depends essentially on the subunit composition of the receptors, in particular, on residues in positions 2' and 6' that form the pore-facing rings R(2') and R(6'). Thus, CTB blocks alpha(1) and alpha(1)/beta, but not alpha(2) GlyRs (Rundström, N., V. Schmieden, H. Betz, J. Bormann, and D. Langosch. 1994. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 91:8950-8954). PTX blocks homomeric receptors (alpha(1) GlyR and rat rho(1) GABAR), but weakly antagonizes heteromeric receptors (alpha(1)/beta GlyR and rho(1)/rho(2) GABAR) (Pribilla, I., T. Takagi, D. Langosch, J. Bormann, and H. Betz. 1992. EMBO J. 11:4305-4311; Zhang D., Z. H. Pan, X. Zhang, A. D. Brideau, and S. A. Lipton. 1995. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 92:11756-11760). Using as a template the kinked-helices model of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the open state (Tikhonov, D. B., and B. S. Zhorov. 1998. Biophys. J. 74:242-255), we have built homology models of GlyRs and GABARs and calculated Monte Carlo-minimized  profiles for the blockers pulled through the pore. The profiles have shallow minima at the wide extracellular half of the pore, a barrier at ring R(6'), and a deep minimum between rings R(6') and R(2') where the blockers interact with five M2s simultaneously. The star-like CTB swings necessarily on its way through ring R(6') and its activity inversely correlates with the barrier at R(6'): (6')s and Ala(2')s in alpha(2) GlyR confine the swinging by increasing the barrier, while Gly(2')s in alpha(1) GlyR and (6')s in beta GlyR shrink the barrier. PTX has an egg-like shape with an isopropenyl group at the elongated end and the rounded end trimmed by ether and carbonyl oxygens. In the optimal binding mode to alpha(1) GlyR and rho(1) GABAR, the rounded end of PTX accepts several H-bonds from (6')s, while the elongated end enters ring R(2'). The lack of H-bond donors on the side chains of (6')s (beta GlyR) and Met(6')s (rho(2) GABAR) deteriorates the binding. The hydrophilic elongated end of picrotin does not fit the hydrophobic ring of Pro(2')s/Ala(2')s in GABARs, but fit a more hydrophilic ring with Gly(2')s in GlyRs. This analysis provides explanations for structure-activity relationships of noncompetitive agonists and predicts a narrow pore of LGICs in agreement with experimental data on the permeation of organic cations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19286827>Amino acid digestibility and concentration of digestible and metabolizable  in soybean meal produced from conventional, high-protein, or low-oligosaccharide varieties of soybeans and fed to growing pigs.</a></h2><p>Two experiments were conducted to determine AA digestibility and the concentration of DE and ME in 5 sources of soybean meal (SBM). The 5 sources included hexane-extracted SBM produced from high-protein soybeans (SBM-HP) and conventional soybeans (SBM-CONV), and mechanically extruded-expelled SBM produced from high-protein soybeans (EE-SBM-HP), low-oligosaccharide soybeans (EE-SBM-LO), and conventional soybeans (EE-SBM-CONV). Five diets that each contained 1 source of SBM and a N-free diet were used in Exp. 1 to determine AA digestibility in each meal. Twelve growing barrows (initial BW: 67.7 +/- 1.34 kg) were allotted to a replicated 6 x 6 Latin square design with 6 periods and 6 diets in each square. Each period lasted 7 d, and ileal digesta were collected on d 6 and 7 of each period. Results of the experiment showed that the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of all AA except Trp was similar for SBM-HP and SBM-CONV, but EE-SBM-HP and EE-SBM-LO had greater (P < 0.05) SID of His, Ile, Lys, , and Val than EE-SBM-CONV. The SID of all indispensable AA in EE-SBM-HP was greater (P < 0.05) than in SBM-HP. The SID of Arg, Ile, Leu, and  in EE-SBM-CONV was greater (P < 0.05) than in SBM-CONV, but the SID of Trp was also greater (P < 0.05) in SBM-CONV than in EE-SBM-CONV. Experiment 2 was conducted to measure DE and ME in the same 5 sources of SBM as used in Exp. 1. Forty-eight growing barrows (initial BW: 38.6 +/- 3.46 kg) were placed in metabolism cages and randomly allotted to 6 diets with 8 replicates per diet. A corn-based diet and 5 diets based on a mixture of corn and each source of SBM were formulated. Urine and feces were collected during a 5-d collection period, and values for DE and ME in each source of SBM were calculated using the difference procedure. Results showed that the ME in SBM-HP tended to be greater (P = 0.10) than in SBM-CONV (4,074 vs. 3,672 kcal/kg of DM). The ME in EE-SBM-HP also tended to be greater (P = 0.10) than in EE-SBM-CONV and in EE-SBM-LO (4,069 vs. 3,620 and 3,721 kcal/kg of DM), but there was no difference in ME between extracted and extruded-expelled meals. It is concluded that SBM-HP has a greater feeding value than SBM-CONV because of greater concentrations of digestible AA and ME. Likewise, EE-SBM-LO has a greater concentration of most indispensable AA than EE-SBM-CONV, but the concentration of ME is similar in these 2 meals. Results of this experiment also showed that AA digestibility values in extruded-expelled SBM are greater than in hexane-extracted SBM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31250016>Evaluation of the nutritive value of legume alternatives to soybean meal for broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>Five experiments were conducted to investigate the nutritional value of various legumes and a faba beans processing co-product for broilers. In Expt. 1 and 3, metabolizable energy (AME) content was evaluated for 2 batches of bean starch concentrate (BSC) that differed in physical and chemical characteristics. Standardized ileal amino acid digestibility (SIAAD) was determined for BSC in Expt. 2, and for corn, soybean meal (SBM), organic and conventional faba beans, and quinoa (Expt. 4). The growth performance response of broiler chickens to partial replacement of wheat and SBM with various legumes was investigated in Expt. 5. The AME of the BSC assayed in Expt. 1 was lower (P < 0.01) than that of the BSC assayed in Expt. 3. The SIAAD was generally high for BSC in Expt. 2 although the content and digestibility of sulfur amino acids were low. In Expt. 4, there was no difference in SIAAD of Arg, , Asp, and Gly among the different feedstuffs assayed. SIAAD was largely similar for both conventional and organic faba bean. The SIAADs of Met, , Ser, and Tyr were lower (P < 0.05) for quinoa compared with SBM or corn. In Expt. 5, FCR was greater (P < 0.05) for broiler chickens receiving faba beans+barley mix or lupins compared with the wheat-SBM control diet. Amino acid digestibility was greater (P < 0.01) for the diets containing lupins compared with the other diets except for Lys, Met, , Ala, Asp, and Ser. On the other hand, amino acid digestibility in diet with faba beans+barley mix was lower (P < 0.05) compared with all the other diets, except for Arg, Asp, Lys, and . It was concluded from the current studies that there is scope for using the assayed legumes, co-products, and quinoa in broiler chickens to partly replace SBM as protein feedstuffs.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9046350>Conformational analysis of three NK1 tripeptide antagonists: a proton nuclear magnetic resonance study.</a></h2><p>Two new peptides, tailored after Ac--D-Trp(CHO)--NMeBzl (TRI), namely, Ac--D-Trp(CHO)--NMe alpha MeBzl (TRA) and Ac--D-Trp(CHO)-Oic-NMeBzl (TOI), in which  is replaced by (3aS, 7aS)-octahydroindole-2-carboxylic acid, proved more potent and selective NK1 antagonists.

In previous work, stimulating MOPRs by infusing the highly selective MOPR agonist [d-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO) into the lateral parabrachial region (LPBN) increased food intake. The highly selective MOPR antagonist d--Cys-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH2 (CTAP) prevented the hyperphagic action of DAMGO. The present experiments aimed to analyze both the pattern of neural activation and the underlying cellular processes associated with MOPR activation in the LPBN. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received a unilateral microinfusion of a nearly maximal hyperphagic dose of DAMGO into the LPBN. We then determined the level of c-Fos immunoreactivity in regions throughout the brain. MOPR activation in the LPBN increased c-Fos in the LPBN and in the nucleus accumbens, hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus and hippocampus. Pretreatment with CTAP prevented the increase in c-Fos translation in each of these areas. CTAP also prevented the coupling of MOPRs to their G-proteins which was measured by [(35)S] guanosine 5'-O-[gamma-thio]triphosphate ([(35)S]GTPgammaS) autoradiography. Together, these data strongly suggest that increasing the coupling of MOPRs to their G-proteins in the LPBN disinhibits parabrachial neurons which subsequently leads to excitation of neurons in regions associated with caloric regulation, ingestive reward and cognitive processes in feeding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669310>Dimerization of long hibernation promoting factor from Staphylococcus aureus: Structural analysis and biochemical characterization.</a></h2><p>Staphylococcus aureus hibernation promoting factor (SaHPF) is responsible for the formation of 100S ribosome dimers, which in turn help this pathogen to reduce  spent under unfavorable conditions.

Residues , Val, , Ile, Tyr, Ile andThr in the dimer interface of SaHPF protein were mutated and the effects were analyzed for the formation of 100S disomes of ribosomes isolated from S. aureus. It was shown that substitution of any of single residues , Val, Ile, Tyr and Ile in the SaHPF homodimer interface abolished the ribosome dimerization in vitro.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This family, comprising 23 conserved phosphopeptide-binding modules in man, is inaccessible to small-molecule chemical inhibitors. Here, we develop Bractoppin, a drug-like inhibitor of phosphopeptide recognition by the human BRCA1 tandem (t)BRCT domain, which selectively inhibits substrate binding with nanomolar potency in vitro. Structure-activity exploration suggests that Bractoppin engages BRCA1 tBRCT residues recognizing pSer in the consensus motif, pSer-Pro--, plus an abutting hydrophobic pocket that is distinct in structurally related BRCT domains, conferring selectivity. In cells, Bractoppin inhibits substrate recognition detected by Förster resonance  transfer, and diminishes BRCA1 recruitment to DNA breaks, in turn suppressing damage-induced G2 arrest and assembly of the recombinase, RAD51. But damage-induced MDC1 recruitment, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) generation, and TOPBP1 recruitment remain unaffected. Thus, an inhibitor of phosphopeptide recognition selectively interrupts BRCA1 tBRCT-dependent signals evoked by DNA damage.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

The MS/MS data are required for the analysis of those peptides in ovine plasma in a study to determine the placental transfer of the peptide to the fetus. The synthetic enkephalin-related peptides were: Tyr-D-Arg--Lys-NH2, (DALDA), N,N-diallyl-Tyr-Aib-Aib--Leu-OH, (ICI 174,864), Tyr-D--Gly--Leu-, (DTLET), Tyr-D-Pen-Gly--D-Pen-OH, (DPDPE), and D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH2, (CTAP). Liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry (LSIMS) was used for sample desorption-ionization, and a hybrid (E1BE2qQ) tandem mass spectrometer was used to collect the product-ion spectra. A protonated molecule ion, [M + H]+, was observed for each peptide. Amino acid sequence-determining fragment ion were produced by CID and collected by MS/MS for the three linear peptides, and also for the two disulfide-bond-containing peptides in their unreduced and dithiothreitol (DTT)-reduced forms. The detection level for the [M + H]+ ion of DTLET was ca. 3 pmol; and the stabilities of the CTAP and ICI analogs in plasma were studied.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21472525>Effect of the identity of Xaa on the fragmentation modes of doubly-protonated Ala-Ala-Xaa-Ala-Ala-Ala-Arg.</a></h2><p>The product ion mass spectra resulting from collisional activation of doubly-protonated tryptic-type peptides Ala-Ala-Xaa-Ala-Ala-Ala-Arg have been determined for Xaa = Ala(A), Ser(S), Val(V), (T), Ile(I), (F), Tyr(Y), Sar, Met(M), Trp(W), Pro(P), and Gln(Q). The major fragmentation reaction involves cleavage of the second amide bond (counting from the N-terminus) except for Xaa = Ser and  where elimination of H(2)O from the [M + 2H](+2) ion forms the base peak. In general, the extent of cleavage of the second amide bond shows little dependence on the identity of Xaa and little dependence on whether the bond cleavage involves symmetrical bond cleavage to form a y(5)/b(2) ion pair or asymmetrically to form y (5) (+2) and a neutral b(2) species. Notable exceptions to this generalization occur for Xaa equal to Pro or Sar. For Xaa = Pro only cleavage of the second amide bond is observed, consistent with a pronounced proline effect, i.e., cleavage N-terminal to Pro. When Xaa = Sar considerably enhanced cleavage of the second amide bond also is observed, suggesting that at least part of the proline effect relates to the tertiary nature of the amide nitrogen. In the competition between symmetric and asymmetric bond cleavage an attempt to establish a linear free  correlation in relating ln(y(5)(+2)/y(5)) to PA(H-Xaa-OH) did not lead to a reasonable correlation although the trend of increasing y(5)(+2)/y(5) ratio with increasing proton affinity of H-Xaa-OH was clear. Proline showed a unique behavior in giving a much higher y(5)(+2)/y(5) ratio than any of the other residues studied.© American Society for Mass Spectrometry, 2011</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9562614>Effects of point mutations at the flexible loop alanine-145 of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase on its stability and function.</a></h2><p>To elucidate the role of a flexible loop (residues 142-149) in the stability and function of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase, alanine-145 in this loop was substituted by site-directed mutagenesis with ten amino acids (Glu, , Gly, His, Ile, Leu, Arg, Ser, , and Val). The amount of three mutant proteins (A145E, A145I, and A145L) in cells was too small to allow the measurement of circular dichroism (CD) spectra and urea unfolding. The CD spectra of other seven mutants were identical with those of the wild-type DHFR, indicating that the native conformation of DHFR was not affected by the mutations. The free  change of unfolding by urea decreased with an increase in the hydrophobicity of amino acid residues introduced, A145T>A145R>A145G>=A145S>=A145H>A145V++ +>wild-type>=A145F. The steady-state kinetic parameters for the enzyme reaction, Km and ksub, were only slightly influenced by the mutations. These results suggest that site 145 in the flexible loop plays an important role in the stability but has little or no effect on the native structure and function of this enzyme. The characteristics of the mutations are discussed in comparison with those of mutations at site 67 [Ohmae et al. (1996) J. Biochem. 119, 703-710] and at site 121 [Gekko et al. (1994) J.

In the absence of active-site ligands, the C-terminal segment is not fixed in one position and is not detectable in the crystal structure. A key residue in the alpha 9-helix is  220, which can interact with both the enzyme-bound glutathione and the second substrate, and possibly guide the reactants into the transition state. Mutation of  220 into Ala and  was shown to reduce the catalytic efficiency of GST A1-1. The mutation of an additional residue,  222, caused further decrease in activity. The presence of a viscosogen in the reaction medium decreased the kinetic parameters K(cat) and K(cat)/K(m) for the conjugation of CDNB catalyzed by wild-type GST A1-1, in agreement with the view that product release is rate limiting for the substrate-saturated enzyme. The mutations cause a decrease of the viscosity dependence of both kinetic parameters, indicating that the motion of the alpha 9-helix is linked to catalysis in wild-type GST A1-1. The isomerization reaction with the alternative substrate Delta(5)-androstene-3,17-dione (AD) is affected in a similar manner by the viscosogens. The transition state  of the isomerization reaction, like that of the CDNB conjugation, is lowered by  220 as indicated by the effects of the mutations on K(cat)/K(m). The results demonstrate that  220 and  222, in the dynamic C-terminal segment, influence rate-determining steps in the catalytic mechanism of both the substitution and the isomerization reactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15787211>[Spatial structure of myelopeptides: I.

The computed side chain-side chain interaction energies were used as substitutes for the corresponding values used by the helix/coil transition algorithm, AGADIR. Predictions of peptide helical contents were nearly as successful as those obtained with the originally calibrated set of parameters; a correlation to experimentally observed alpha-helical populations of 0.91 proved that our theoretical estimates are reasonably correct for amino acid pairs that are frequent in our database of peptides. Furthermore, we have determined experimentally the previously uncharacterized interaction energies for Lys-Ile, -Ile, and -Ile amino acid pairs at i,i + 4 positions. The experimental values compare favorably with the computed theoretical estimates. Importantly, the computed values for -Ile and -Ile interactions are better than the energies based on chemical similarity, whereas for Lys-Ile they are similar. Thus, computational techniques can be used to provide precise energies for amino acid pairwise interactions, a fact that supports the development of structure -based computational tools for structure predictions and sequence design.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24874699>Label-free monitoring of μ-opioid receptor-mediated signaling.</a></h2><p>In this study, we used a combination of traditional signaling investigation approaches, bioluminescence resonance  transfer (BRET) biosensors, and the label-free approach surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy to monitor the signaling cascades of the μ-opioid receptor (MOP). In human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing a Flag-tagged version of human MOP, we compared the signals triggered by the noninternalizing and internalizing MOP agonists morphine and DAMGO (Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-N-methyl--Gly-ol), respectively. We studied three major and well described components of MOP signaling: receptor internalization, G protein coupling, and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK1/ERK2. Our results show that morphine and DAMGO display different profiles of receptor internalization and a similar ability to trigger the phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2. Our SPR analyses revealed that morphine and DAMGO evoke similar SPR signatures and that Gαi, cAMP-dependent pathways, and ERK1/ERK2 have key roles in morphine- and DAMGO-mediated signaling. Most interestingly, we found that the so-called MOP neutral antagonists CTOP (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen--NH(2)), naloxone, and naltrexone behave like partial agonists. Even more intriguing, BRET experiments indicate that CTAP (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH(2)) induces similar conformational changes as naltrexone at the Gαi-βγ interface, whereas it appears as an inverse agonist based on its SPR response thus indicating distinct signaling mechanisms for the two ligands. Taken together, our results support the usefulness of label-free methods such as SPR to study whole-cell responses and signaling cascades triggered by G protein-coupled receptors and complement the conventional approaches by revealing cellular responses that would have been otherwise undetectable.Copyright © 2014 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15456779>Proton-assisted two-electron transfer in natural variants of tetraheme cytochromes from Desulfomicrobium Sp.</a></h2><p>The tetraheme cytochrome c3 isolated from Desulfomicrobium baculatum (DSM 1743)(Dsmb) was cloned, and the sequence analysis showed that this cytochrome differs in just three amino acid residues from the cytochrome c3 isolated from Desulfomicrobium norvegicum (Dsmn): (DsmnXXDsmb) -37 --> Ser, Val-45 --> Ala, and -88 --> Tyr. X-ray crystallography was used to determine the structure of cytochrome c3 from Dsmb, showing that it is very similar to the published structure of cytochrome c3 from Dsmn. A detailed thermodynamic and kinetic characterization of these two tetraheme cytochromes c3 was performed by using NMR and visible spectroscopy. The results obtained show that the network of cooperativities between the redox and protonic centers is consistent with a synergetic process to stimulate the hydrogen uptake activity of hydrogenase. This is achieved by increasing the affinity of the cytochrome for protons through binding electrons and, reciprocally, by favoring a concerted two-electron transfer assisted by the binding of proton(s). The data were analyzed within the framework of the differences in the primary and tertiary structures of the two proteins, showing that residue 88, close to heme I, is the main cause for the differences in the microscopic thermodynamic parameters obtained for these two cytochromes c3. This comparison reveals how replacement of a single amino acid can tune the functional properties of -transducing proteins, so that they can be optimized to suit the bioenergetic constraints of specific habitats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8690663>Metabolic changes and nutrient repletion in lambs provided with electrolyte solutions before and after feed and water deprivation.</a></h2><p>Providing feeder calves and lambs with electrolyte solutions before and(or) after a transport period could potentially reduce tissue shrink and speed repletion of nutrients and weight that are lost during transport. This trial was conducted to determine metabolic changes and nutrient repletion in lambs provided with electrolyte solutions before and after feed and water deprivation. Solutions were 1) deionized water, 2) ES1 (g/10 L: NaCl, 2.0; K carbonate, 2.8; Mg sulfate.7H2O, 2.0; equal mixture of amino acids [Lys, , , His, Trp, Met, Leu, Ile, and Val], .45; and phosphoric acid to pH 7.0), 3) ES2 (twice the concentrations as in ES1), and ES3 (g/10 L: NaCl 2.0; K carbonate, 8.0; Mg sulfate.7H2O, 4.0; amino acid mixture from ES1, .45; and phosphoric acid to pH 7.0). Eight Suffolk x Hampshire crossbred lambs (average BW 35 +/- 2 kg) were used in an 8 x 8 Latin square design with treatments arranged in a 2 x 4 factorial. Main treatments consisted of two deprivation electrolyte solutions (deionized water or ES1) and four realimentation electrolyte solutions (deionized water, ES1, ES2, and ES3). Lambs were limit-fed (600 g/d, as-fed basis) before and after a 3-d feed and water deprivation phase. Lambs provided the ES1 solution during the pre-deprivation phase had greater (P < .05) Na, Mg, Zn retention during the pre-deprivation phase, had greater (P < .05) Na and Mg losses during the 3-d deprivation phase, and greater (P < .05) cumulative Na, Cu, and Fe retentions than lambs given deionized water during the pre-deprivation phase. Compared to lambs provided water, lambs provided the ES1 solution during the realimentation phase had greater Na retention but similar K, Mg, and water retentions. However, when the concentration of electrolytes in the solution was doubled (i.e., ES2 solution), Na, K, and Mg retentions were increased (P < .05) compared with those of lambs provided deionized water or the ES1 solution. These results suggest that as the length or severity of the stress period increases, the concentration of electrolytes in the electrolyte solution may need to be increased to improve nutrient balance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18558627>Phosphoproteome analysis of isoflurane-protected heart mitochondria: phosphorylation of adenine nucleotide translocator-1 on Tyr194 regulates mitochondrial function.</a></h2><p>Reversible phosphorylation of mitochondrial proteins is essential in the regulation of respiratory function,  metabolism, and mitochondrion-mediated cell death. We hypothesized that mitochondrial protein phosphorylation plays a critical role in cardioprotection during pre and postconditioning, two of the most efficient anti-ischaemic therapies.Using phosphoproteomic approaches, we investigated the profiles of phosphorylated proteins in Wistar rat heart mitochondria protected by pharmacological pre and postconditioning elicited by isoflurane. Sixty-one spots were detected by two-dimensional blue-native gel electrophoresis-coupled Western blotting using a phospho-Ser//Tyr-specific antibody, and 45 of these spots were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Eleven protein spots related to oxidative phosphorylation,  metabolism, chaperone, and carrier functions exhibited significant changes in their phosphorylation state when protected mitochondria were compared with unprotected. Using a phosphopeptide enrichment protocol followed by liquid chromatography-MS/MS, 26 potential phosphorylation sites were identified in 19 proteins. Among these, a novel phosphorylation site was detected in adenine nucleotide translocator-1 (ANT1) at residue Tyr(194). Changes in ANT phosphorylation between protected and unprotected mitochondria were confirmed by immunoprecipitation. The biological significance of ANT phosphorylation at Tyr(194) was further tested with site-directed mutagenesis in yeast. Substitution of Tyr(194) with , mimicking the non-phosphorylated state, resulted in the inhibition of yeast growth on non-fermentable carbon sources, implying a critical role of phosphorylation at this residue in regulating ANT function and cellular respiration.Our analysis emphasizes the regulatory functions of the phosphoproteome in heart mitochondria and reveals a novel, potential link between bioenergetics and cardioprotection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19440631>Free energies and forces in helix-coil transition of homopolypeptides under stretching.</a></h2><p>We show here that constant velocity steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations of alpha-helices in a vacuum present a well defined plateau in the force-extension relationship for homopolypeptides having more than (approximately) twenty residues.

The isolates grew at 60 to 97 degrees C, with the optimum temperatures at 85 to 90 degrees C. Sensitivity to rifampin and the existence of ether lipids indicated that the isolates are hyperthermophilic archaea. Partial sequencing of the genes coding for 16S rRNA showed that the three isolates are closely related to the genus Thermococcus. They grew on proteinaceous mixtures, such as yeast extract, Casamino Acids, and purified proteins (e.g., casein and gelatin), but not on carbohydrates or organic acids as sole carbon and  sources. Nine amino acids were essential for growth of isolate KS-1 (, Leu, Ile, Val, Met, , His, Tyr, and Arg). Isolate KS-2 required Lys in addition to the nine amino acids, and KS-8 required Lys instead of Tyr. In comparative studies, it was shown that Thermococcus celer DSM 2476 required 10 amino acids (, Leu, Ile, Val, Met, , Tyr, Trp, Lys, and Arg) while Pyrococcus furiosus DSM 3638 required only Ile and Val.

The human cytochrome P450 4X1 (CYP4X1) is categorized as "orphan" CYP because of its unknown function. In recent studies it is found that this enzyme is expressed in neurovascular functions of the brain. Also, various studies have found the expression and activity of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 in cancer. It is found to be a potential drug target for cancer therapy. However, three-dimensional structure, the active site topology and substrate specificity of CYP4X1 remain unclear.In the present study, the three-dimensional structure of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 was generated by homology modeling using Modeller 9v8. The generated structure was accessed for geometrical errors and  stability using PROCHECK, VERFIY 3D and PROSA. A molecular docking analysis was carried out against substrates arachidonic acid and anandamide and the docked substrates were predicted for drug-likeness, ADME-Tox parameters and biological spectrum activity.The three-dimensional model of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 was generated and assessed with various structural validation programmes. Docking of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 with arachidonic acid revealed that TYR 112, ALA 126, ILE 222, ILE 223,  312, LEU 315, ALA 316, ASP 319,  320,  491 and ILE 492 residues were actively participating in the interaction, while docking of CYP4X1 with anandamide showed that TYR 112, GLN 114, PRO 118, ALA 126, ILE 222, ILE 223, SER 251, LEU 315, ALA 316 and  491 key residues were involved in strong interaction.From this study, several key residues were identified to be responsible for the binding of arachidonic acid and anandamide with orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1. Both substrates obeyed Lipinski rule of five in drug-likeness test and biological spectrum prediction showed anticarcinogenic activity. Compared to anandamide, arachidonic acid showed strong interaction with cytochrome P450 4X1 and also less health effect in certain human system in ADME-Tox prediction.

The growth rate and efficiency (grams of bacteria per gram of sugars) increased by 46 and 15%, respectively, when a mixture of 20 amino acids was added. On the other hand, neither growth rate nor efficiency increased when any one of these amino acids was added singly, except for Glu and Gln, each of which produced significant but small improvements. The stimulatory effect of the combined amino acids on bacterial growth declined when each of Leu, Trp, Tyr, Glu, Met, , and Val was removed from the original group of 20. When a mixture of only these seven amino acids was used as a supplement, their stimulatory effects on growth rate and efficiency were only 21 and 25%, respectively, of the effects that the mixture of 20 amino acids showed. The effects increased to 76 and 72% on growth rate and efficiency, respectively, when Gly, Cys, and His were supplied in addition to the seven amino acids. The growth rate and efficiency of the ruminal bacteria were inhibited by an addition of each of Ile, , Cys, , Leu, Lys, or Val to ammonia-N, and the effects of the first five of these amino acids were highly significant. Isoleucine, threonine, and phenylalanine were each inhibitory even at a low concentration (1 mg of NL), while cysteine and leucine showed inhibitory effects at higher concentrations (more than 10 mg of N/L). A higher growth rate of the ruminal bacteria when supplemented with amino acid mixtures was accompanied with a higher growth efficiency, which was attributable to a relatively smaller proportion of  expended on maintenance according to the Pirt derivation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28423885>Effect of fermented biogas residue on growth performance, serum biochemical parameters, and meat quality in pigs.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the effect of fermented biogas residue (FBR) of wheat on the performance, serum biochemical parameters, and meat quality in pigs.We selected 128 pigs (the mean initial body weight was 40.24±3.08 kg) and randomly allocated them to 4 groups (1 control group and 3 treatment groups) with 4 replicates per group and 8 pigs per pen in a randomized complete block design based on initial body weight and sex. The control group received a corn-soybean meal-based diet, the treatment group fed diets containing 5%, 10%, and 15% FBR, respectively (abbreviated as FBR5, FBR10, and FBR15, respectively). Every group received equivalent- and nitrogen diets. The test lasted 60 days and was divided into early and late stages. Blood and carcass samples were obtained on 60 d. Meat quality was collected from two pigs per pen.During the late stage, the average daily feed intake and average daily gain of the treatment groups was greater than that of the control group (p<0.05). During the entire experiment, the average daily gain of the treatment groups was higher than that of the control group (p<0.05). Fermented biomass residue did not significantly affect serum biochemical parameters or meat quality, but did affect amino acid profiles in pork. The contents of Asp, Arg, Tyr, , Leu, , Ser, Lys, Pro, Ala, essential amino acids, non-essential amino acids, and total amino acids in pork of FBR5 and FBR10 were greater than those of the control group (p<0.05).These combined results suggest that feeding FBR could increase the average daily gain and average daily feed intake in pigs and the content of several flavor-promoting amino acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17441902>Molecular modeling suggests conformational scaffolds specifically targeting five subtypes of somatostatin receptors.</a></h2><p>Several analogs of somatostatin with conformational constraints in their peptide backbones have been modeled to determine energetically feasible conformations. Comparison of low- backbone structures of these peptides suggested unique conformations of the central /Ala(i)-D-Trp(i+1)-Lys(i+2)-(i+3) fragment characteristic for specific interactions of somatostatin with each of the five distinct subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs). The conformations obtained were in good agreement with experimental data obtained earlier by NMR measurements and/or X-ray crystallography. The results help rationalize experimental observations on the specificity of binding of various somatostatin analogs with different subtypes of the SSTRs. They also serve as templates for the design of conformationally constrained non-peptide scaffolds that effectively and selectively interact with different subtypes of SSTRs. Such scaffolds can be convenient carriers of radiolabels and near-infrared labels in specific agents for imaging tumors expressing different SSTR subtypes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19640846>Structural basis for enzymatic evolution from a dedicated ADP-ribosyl cyclase to a multifunctional NAD hydrolase.</a></h2><p>Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) is a universal calcium messenger molecule that regulates many physiological processes. The production and degradation of cADPR are catalyzed by a family of related enzymes, including the ADP-ribosyl cyclase from Aplysia california (ADPRAC) and CD38 from human. Although ADPRC and CD38 share a common evolutionary ancestor, their enzymatic functions toward NAD and cADPR homeostasis have evolved divergently. Thus, ADPRC can only generate cADPR from NAD (cyclase), whereas CD38, in contrast, has multiple activities, i.e. in cADPR production and degradation, as well as NAD hydrolysis (NADase). In this study, we determined a number of ADPRC and CD38 structures bound with various nucleotides. From these complexes, we elucidated the structural features required for the cyclization (cyclase) reaction of ADPRC and the NADase reaction of CD38. Using the structural approach in combination with site-directed mutagenesis, we identified -174 in ADPRC as a critical residue in directing the folding of the substrate during the cyclization reaction. Thus, a point mutation of -174 to glycine can turn ADPRC from a cyclase toward an NADase. The equivalent residue in CD38, -221, is shown to disfavor the cyclizing folding of the substrate, resulting in NADase being the dominant activity. The comprehensive structural comparison of CD38 and APDRC presented in this study thus provides insights into the structural determinants for the functional evolution from a cyclase to a hydrolase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28046153> content and amino acid digestibility of flaxseed expellers fed to growing pigs.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to determine the DE and ME as well as the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA in flaxseed expellers fed to growing pigs. In Exp. 1, the DE and ME were determined using 66 crossbred growing pigs (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire; 54.2 ± 2.3 kg BW) fed 1 of 11 diets in a completely randomized design. The diets included a corn-soybean meal basal diet and 10 experimental diets containing 29.16% flaxseed expellers supplemented at the expense of corn and soybean meal.

There was considerable variation in the chemical composition among the 10 flaxseed expellers. The CV were greater than 10% for ether extract (EE), NDF, ADF, crude fiber, and Ca and ranged from 7 to 12% for the AA. On a DM basis, the DE and ME ranged from 2,786 to 3,730 and from 2,588 to 3,530 kcal/kg, respectively. The apparent total tract digestibility of GE ranged from 59.91 to 75.83% (mean = 70.92%). Ether extract, GE, and NDF were the best predictors to determine DE and ME. The best prediction equations were DE = -3,231 + (1.58 × GE) - (25.79 × % NDF) ( = 0.90) or DE = 4,189 + (56.78 × % EE) - (30.59 × % NDF) ( = 0.85) and ME = -2,968 + (1.47 × GE) - (24.82 × % NDF) ( = 0.85) or ME = 3,931 + (53.77 × % EE) - (29.31 × % NDF) ( = 0.82), respectively. In Exp. 2, there were significant differences in the AID and SID of CP and all AA with the exception of  ( < 0.05). The AID and SID of CP averaged 70.16 and 78.04%, respectively. For the indispensable AA, the AID and SID of  were the least, with average values of 70.70 and 76.68%, respectively. The digestibility of Arg and Met were the greatest, averaging over 88 and 91% for AID and SID, respectively. The AID and SID of Lys ranged from 66.10 to 81.82% (mean = 74.14%) and from 70.90 to 85.41% (mean = 78.13%), respectively. These results indicate that there is significant variability in chemical composition,  content, and the SID and AID of CP and AA among the selected flaxseed expellers. The DE and ME of flaxseed expellers are primarily related to their EE and NDF concentrations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12510389>[Structures of peptides related to the inactivation gate on sodium channels].</a></h2><p>The peptides related to inactivation of sodium channels were synthesized by the solid-phase method for the purpose of proposing a more precise concept than so far obtained for the inactivation and to determine the main factors that control inactivation. The three-dimensional structures of the peptides were determined using 1H-NMR spectroscopy. It was newly discovered that hydrogen bonding was formed between the amide proton of Ile in the IFM (IFM1488-1490) motif of the III-IV linker and the hydroxyl oxygen atom of the side chain of  located adjacent to the IFM motif. This hydrogen bonding characterizes the structure around the IFM motif. By calculating the solvent-accessible surface area of the peptide corresponding to the III-IV linker, it was found that a hydrophobic cluster was formed. The hydrophobic cluster stabilizes the structure of the IFM motif. Moreover, the solvent-accessible surface area of the IFM motif correlated with the sustained currents of the incompletely inactivated sodium channels. The free  of stabilization by hydrophobic interactions (delta G, -3.9 kcal mol-1), which is calculated from the solvent-accessible surface area for the IFM motif (195 A2), was in good agreement with that calculated for the equilibrium between the open and the inactivated states of the sodium channels (-4.1 kcal mol-1). The structure of the III-IV linker peptide in a phosphate buffer also formed a hydrophobic cluster, as well as in SDS micelles, although no hydrogen bonding was formed. This distinction results in the following conformational change in the IFM motif: in SDS micelles, the side chains of Ile and  in the IFM motif were directed to the hydrophobic cluster, whereas those in a phosphate buffer were directed opposite to the cluster and solvent exposed. The secondary structures of IIIS4-S5 and IVS4-S5, which are considered to form a receptor site, assumed alpha-helical conformations around the N-terminal half of the sequences. The residue A1329 in MPD3, which is considered to interact with F1489 of the IFM motif, was found to locate within the alpha-helix. A hydrophobic cluster was formed on one side of the helix of MP-D4, which also plays an important role in the inactivation. A new concept for the process of fast inactivation is presented. In response to the voltage-dependent activation and the movement of the S4 segments, the two hydrophobic clusters due to the IVS4-S5 and the III-IV linker interact with each other. This interaction increases the hydrophobicity around the IFM motif. The increased hydrophobicity causes the conformational switching of the IF1488-1489 residues to allow F1489 to interact with A1329 of IIIS4-S5 and/or with N1662 in IVS4-S5. As a consequence of this process, the inactivation gate closes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8075111>Catalysis and  coupling of H(+)-ATPase (ATP synthase): molecular biological approaches.</a></h2><p>The molecular biological approach has provided important information for understanding the F0F1 H(+)-ATPase. This article focuses on our recent results on the catalytic site in the beta subunit, and the roles of alpha/beta subunit interaction and amino/carboxyl terminal interaction of the gamma subunit in  coupling. Extensive mutagenesis of the beta subunit revealed that beta Lys-155, beta -156, beta Glu-181 and beta Arg-182 are essential catalytic residues. beta Glu-185 is not absolutely essential, but a carboxyl residue may be necessary at this position. A pseudo-revertant analysis positioned beta Gly-172, beta Ser-174, beta Glu-192 and beta Val-198 in the proximity of beta Gly-149. The finding of the roles of beta Gly-149, beta Lys-155, and beta -156 emphasized the importance of the glycine-rich sequence (Gly-X-X-X-X-Gly-Lys-/Ser, E. coli beta residues between beta Gly-149 and beta -156) conserved in many nucleotide binding proteins. The A subunits of vacuolar type ATPases may have a similar catalytic mechanism because they have conserved glycine-rich and Gly-Glu-Arg (corresponding to beta Gly-180-beta Arg-182) sequences. The results of these mutational studies are consistent with the labeling of beta Lys-155 and beta Lys-201 with AP3-PL, and of beta Glu-192 with DCCD [15]. The DCCD-binding residue of a thermophilic Bacillus corresponds to beta Glu-181, an essential catalytic residue discussed above. The defective coupling of the beta Ser-174--> mutant was suppressed by the second mutation alpha Arg-296-->Cys, indicating the importance of alpha/beta interaction in  coupling. The gamma subunit, especially its amino/carboxyl interaction, seems to be essential for  coupling between catalysis and transport judging from studies on gamma Met-23-->Lys or Arg mutation and second-site mutations which suppressed the gamma Lys-23 mutation. Thus the conserved gamma Met-23 is not absolutely essential but is located in the important region for amino/carboxyl interaction for  coupling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11563031>Restricted rotation in chiral peptide nucleic acid (PNA) monomers--influence of substituents studied by means of 1H NMR.</a></h2><p>The influence of amino acid side chains [derived from: Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, , Tyr(Bzl), Ser(Bzl), (Bzl), Pro, Trp], incorporated into "aminoalkyl" part of PNA monomers, on the temperature-dependent distributions of rotamers about the tertiary amide bond was studied by means of 1H NMR at 0, 25 and 40 degrees C in CDCl3.

An additional experiment was conducted to determine effects on growth performance and blood characteristics of including SPC in diets fed to weanling pigs. In Exp. 1, a N-free diet and diets containing soybean meal, fish meal, or SPC ground to a mean particle size of 70, 180, or 700 μm as the only source of AA were fed to 6 barrows (initial BW: 12.90 ± 1.51 kg) that had a T-cannula installed in the distal ileum. In Exp. 2, 36 barrows (13.70 ± 1.86 kg BW) were allotted to a randomized complete block design with 6 diets and 6 replicate pigs per diet. A corn-based diet and diets containing corn and soybean meal, fish meal, or SPC ground to the 3 particle sizes were used. In Exp. 3, 160 pigs (initial BW: 7.06 ± 1.07 kg) were allotted to 4 dietary treatments with 8 pens per treatment and 5 pigs per pen. Pigs were fed one of 4 diets during phase 1 (d 0 to 14 postweaning), and a common diet in phase 2 (d 14 to 28 postweaning). The 4 diets used in phase 1 included a control diet containing fish meal and spray-dried plasma protein, and diets in which fish meal, spray-dried plasma protein, or both fish meal and spray-dried plasma protein were replaced by SPC ground to 180 μm. Results of Exp. 1 indicated that the SID of His, Lys, and  tended ( < 0.10) to be greater in SPC ground to 180 μm than in soybean meal, and the SID of Arg, Ile, , and Trp was greater ( < 0.05) in SPC ground to 70 or 180 μm than in soybean meal. There were no differences in the DE and ME (DM-basis) among corn, soybean meal, fish meal, and SPC ground to 70, 180, or 700 μm. Results of Exp. 3 indicated that growth performance of pigs fed the 4 experimental diets in phase 1 was not different in phase 1, phase 2, or in the entire experiment. In conclusion, grinding SPC to approximately 180 µm maximizes SID of indispensable AA without impacting ME and diets based on soybean meal and SPC as the main protein sources may be fed to pigs during the initial 2 wk postweaning without affecting growth performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12413086>Nutrient database for distiller's dried grains with solubles produced from new ethanol plants in Minnesota and South Dakota.</a></h2><p>A study was conducted to evaluate the nutrient content and variability of distiller's dried grains with solubles (DDGS) originating from new (less than 5 yr old) ethanol plants in Minnesota and South Dakota. Ten plants (8 MN, 2 SD) participated in the study, submitting a total of 118 samples. Samples were collected every 2 mo from ten ethanol plants in the Minnesota-South Dakota (MNSD) region from 1997 to 1999 and were analyzed for amino acid levels, DM, CP, crude fiber, crude fat, ash, ADF, NDF, Ca, P, K, Mg, S, Na, Zn, Mn, Cu, and Fe analysis. Digestible  (DE), ME, and NFE levels were also calculated. Means (dry-matter basis) and coefficients of variation for each nutrient among all plants during 1997 to 1999 were DM (88.9%, 1.7%), CP (30.2%, 6.4%), crude fat (10.9%, 7.8%), crude fiber (8.8%, 8.7%), ash (5.8%, 14.7%), NFE (45.5%, 6.1%), ADF (16.2%, 28.4%), NDF (42.1%, 14.3%), calculated DE (3,990 kcal/kg, 3.24%), calculated ME (3,749 kcal/kg, 3.28%), Arg (1.20%, 9.1%), His (0.76%, 7.8%), Ile (1.12%, 8.7%), Leu (3.55%, 6.4%), Lys (0.85%, 17.3%), Met (0.55%, 13.6%),  (1.47%, 6.6%),  (1.13%, 6.4%), Trp (0.25%, 6.7%), Val (1.50%, 7.2%), Ca (0.06%, 57.2%), and P (0.89%, 11.7%), respectively. Among the amino acids analyzed, Lys was the most variable (CV = 17.3%), followed by Met (CV = 13.6%). Nutrient levels of MNSD DDGS were higher in crude fat, NDF, DE, ME, P, Lys, Met, and  and lower for DM, ADF, and Ca than NRC (1998) values. Nutrient values differed between years for ash, DE, Mn, Zn, Cys (P < 0.10), Fat, TDN, ME, Met, Ile (P < 0.05), Ca, P, K, Mg, and Cu (P < 0.01). These results suggest that gross ; P; and total Lys, Met, and  levels are higher in DDGS from MNSD ethanol plants compared to published values and chemical analysis values of a DDGS sample obtained from an older Midwestern plant.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26373048>Interface Adsorption Taking the Most Advantageous Conformation for Electron Transfer Between Graphene and Cytochrome c.</a></h2><p>Most designed functions in biomedical nanotechnology are directly influenced by interactions of biological molecules with nano surfaces. Here, we explored and detected the most favorable adsorption conformation of cytochrome c on graphene by measuring the adsorption , the number of contact atoms, and the minimal distance between protein and surface. From the root mean square deviation of the protein backbone, the radius of gyration, and the proportion of secondary structure, it is revealed that cytochrome c does not deform significantly and the secondary structures are preserved to a large extent. The residues, Lys,  and  contribute significantly to the adsorption of cytochrome c to graphene. The long hydrophobic and flexible alkyl tail of Lys, the π-π stacking interaction between  and graphene, and the presence of abundant  constitute the driving force for the stable adsorption of cytochrome c on graphene. Cytochrome c is adsorbed to graphene with the group heme lying almost perpendicular to the graphene, and the distance between Fe atom and the graphene is 10.15 A, which is shorter than that between electron donor and receptor in many other biosystems. All the results suggest that the most favorable adsorption takes the most advantageous conformation for electron transfer, which promotes significantly the electron transfer between graphene and cytochrome c. The findings might provide new and important information for designs of biomedical devices or products with graphene-based nanomaterials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10398816>Tumour uptake of the radiolabelled somatostatin analogue [DOTA0, TYR3]octreotide is dependent on the peptide amount.</a></h2><p>Radiolabelled tumour receptor-binding peptides can be used for in vivo scintigraphic imaging. Recently, the somatostatin analogue [Tyr3]octreotide (D--c(Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys--Cys)-(ol)) was derivatized with the chelator DOTA (tetra-azacyclododecane-tetra-acetic acid), enabling stable radiolabelling with both the high- beta particle-emitter yttrium-90 and the Auger electron-emitter indium-111. The thus produced radiolabelled compounds are promising for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. Our previous in vitro and in vivo (rat) experiments with these radiolabelled compounds showed favourable binding and biodistribution characteristics with high uptake and retention in the target organs. We also demonstrated receptor-specific, time- and temperature-dependent internalization of radiolabelled [DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotide in somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sst2)-positive rat pancreatic tumour cell lines. In this study we have investigated the effects of differences in the amount of injected peptide on tissue distribution of 111In-labelled [DOTA0, Tyr3]octreotide in normal, i.e. non-tumour-bearing, and CA20948 tumour-bearing rats. This was done in order to find the amount of peptide at which the highest uptake in target tissues is achieved, and thereby to increase the potential of radionuclide therapy while simultaneously ensuring the lowest possible radiotoxicity in normal organs. Uptake of radiolabelled [DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotide in sst2-positive organs showed different bell-shaped functions of the amount of injected peptide, being highest at 0.05 (adrenals), 0.05-0. 1 (pituitary and stomach) and 0.25 (pancreas) microg. Uptake in the tumour was highest at 0.5 microg injected peptide. The highest uptake was found at peptide amounts that were lower than those reported for [111In-DTPA0]octreotide ((D--c(Cys--D-Trp-Lys--Cys)-(ol), DTPA = diethylene-triamine-penta-acetic acid), consistent with the higher receptor affinity of the first compound. Our observations of mass-dependent differences in uptake of radiolabelled [DOTA0, Tyr3]octreotide, being the resultant of a positive effect of increasing amounts of peptide on, for example, receptor clustering and a negative effect of receptor saturation, are of consequence for rat radionuclide therapy studies with radiolabelled peptides and may also be of consequence for human radionuclide therapy studies with this compound.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29086207>Identification of Ideal Multi-targeting Bioactive Compounds Against Mur Ligases of Enterobacter aerogenes and Its Binding Mechanism in Comparison with Chemical Inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Enterobacter aerogenes have been reported as important opportunistic and multi-resistant bacterial pathogens for humans during the last three decades in hospital wards. The emergence of drug-resistant E. aerogenes demands the need for developing new drugs. Peptidoglycan is an important component of the cell wall of bacteria and the peptidoglycan biochemical pathway is considered as the best source of antibacterial targets. Within this pathway, four Mur ligases MurC, MurD, MurE, and MurF are responsible for the successive additions of L-alanine and suitable targets for developing novel antibacterial drugs. As an inference from this fact, we modeled the three-dimensional structure of above Mur ligases using best template structures available in PDB and analyzed its common binding features. Structural refinement and  minimization of the predicted Mur ligases models is also being done using molecular dynamics studies. The models of Mur ligases were further investigated for in silico docking studies using bioactive plant compounds from the literature. Interestingly, these results indicate that four plant compounds Isojuripidine, Atroviolacegenin, Porrigenin B, and Nummularogenin showing better docking results in terms of binding  and number of hydrogen bonds. All these four compounds are spirostan-based compounds with differences in side chains and the amino acid such as ASN, LYS, , HIS, ARG (polar) and , GLY, VAL, ALA, MET (non-polar) playing active role in binding site of all four Mur ligases. Overall, in the predicted model, the four plant compounds with its binding features could pave way to design novel multi-targeted antibacterial plant-based bioactive compounds specific to Mur ligases for the treatment of Enterobacter infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6487083>[Effect of the content of crude plant protein in feed on the utilization of urea in dairy cattle. 4. Passage of amino acids through the duodenum].</a></h2><p>Model investigations carried out by means of a re-entrant method at the duodenum with dairy cows and with -equivalent rations (600 EFU cattle/kg DM), which after the supplementation of 11 g urea/kg DM (150 g/animal and day) contained 13.8 (I), 16.7 (II) and 20.2 (III)% crude protein, had the following results: The amino acid profile of the duodenal protein differed from that of the applied rations and was similar to the microbial protein in the rumen. It only changed inconsiderably with the protein level of the ration. There were differences between the amino acids of the feed as to their apparent rate of fermentation in the rumen. Ser, tyr, lys, and leu apparently proved to be most resistent whereas arg, asp, met, ile and  were apparently fermented for the most part or completely. The passage rate of amino acids at the duodenum related to intake were, from I ... III 126, 102 and 87%. With all rations there were always net losses of some amino acids (his, arg) and net gains (lys, , ser, gly, val, met and tyr) at the duodenum in comparison intake. 15N from urea was incorporated into all the amino acids determined in the duodenal protein, most intensively into glu, ser, asp, ile, gly, his and leu. The apparent digestibility of the total amino acids in the intestines was independent of the crude protein level of the rations and reached 69 ... 71% with a deviation range of 59 ... 81% for the individual amino acids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31074782>Available  and amino acid digestibility of yellow dent corn fed to growing pigs1.</a></h2><p>Two experiments were conducted to determine the DE and ME as well as the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA in corn fed to growing pigs. All corn was yellow dent corn collected from different areas in China. In Exp. 1, 60 crossbred barrows (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire; 40.7 ± 3.5 kg BW) were randomly allotted to 1 of 10 diets to determine the DE and ME of corns. Diets were formulated to contain 96.8% of 1 of the 10 corn samples and 3.2% of other microingredients. In Exp. 2, 11 crossbred barrows (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire; 30.5 ± 2.3 kg) fitted with a T-cannula at the distal ileum were assigned to a 6 × 11 Youden square design with 6 periods and 11 diets. Diets included a N-free diet based on cornstarch and sucrose and 10 test diets formulated with 96.6% 1 of the 10 corns as the sole source of AA. Chromic oxide (0.3%) was added to each diet as an indigestible marker for calculating the AA digestibility. On a DM basis, the starch, ether extract (EE), CP, NDF, and ADF contents of corns averaged 74.05% (69.98 to 78.59%), 3.83% (2.04 to 4.73%), 9.63% (7.74 to 10.43%), 10.80% (10.27 to 11.46%), and 2.27% (2.03 to 2.57%), respectively. The CV of EE, CP, and ADF was 22.59, 8.22, and 8.21%, respectively. The DE and ME of corns averaged 4,087 and 3,981 kcal/kg, respectively, and ranged from 3,999 to 4,161 kcal/kg and from 3,898 to 4,067 kcal/kg, respectively. The DE and ME values were positively correlated (P < 0.05) with the EE content. Optimal prediction equations of ME were ME = 940.35 + (0.72 × DE) + (21.88 × EE) (R2 = 0.94) or ME = 1,051.50 + (0.82 × DE) - (282.05 × ash) (R2 = 0.99). In Exp. 2, significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed in the SID of Arg, His, , Ala, Pro, Cys, and Tyr. The SID of Lys (average 73.79%), Met (average 87.32%), and  (average 80.06%) ranged from 61.45 to 78.47%, from 74.09 to 90.91%, and from 79.19 to 85.79%, respectively. The standardized ileal digestible Met was positively correlated (P < 0.01) with the Met and CP contents. The obtained prediction equations were standardized ileal digestible Met = 31.34 + (3.43 × CP) + (116.04 × Met) and standardized ileal digestible Met = 104.92 + (294.71 × Met) - (7.03 × NDF). In conclusion, sources had an effect on the  values and ileal digestibility of most AA in corn. The ME can be predicted by the DE combined with either the EE or ash content. The AA concentrations and SID of AA in corn varied largely.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.

This limits the molecular understanding of paracellular barriers and strategies for drug delivery across tissue barriers. Cldn3 and Cldn5 are both common in the blood-brain barrier but form TJ strands with different ultrastructures. To identify the molecular determinants of folding and assembly of these classic claudins, Cldn3/Cldn5 chimeric mutants were generated and analyzed by cellular reconstitution of TJ strands, live cell confocal imaging, and freeze-fracture electron microscopy. A comprehensive screening was performed on the basis of the rescue of mutants deficient for strand formation. Cldn3/Cldn5 residues in transmembrane segment 3, TM3 (Ala-127/Cys-128, Ser-136/Cys-137, Ser-138/-139), and the transition of TM3 to extracellular loop 2, ECL2 (-141/Ile-142) and ECL2 (Asn-148/Asp-149, Leu-150/-151, Arg-157/Tyr-158), were identified to be involved in claudin folding and/or assembly. Blue native PAGE and FRET assays revealed 1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside-resistant cis-dimerization for Cldn5 but not for Cldn3. This homophilic interaction was found to be stabilized by residues in TM3. The resulting subtype-specific cis-dimer is suggested to be a subunit of polymeric TJ strands and contributes to the specific ultrastructure of the TJ detected by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. In particular, the Cldn5-like exoplasmic face-associated and particle-type strands were found to be related to cis-dimerization. These results provide new insight into the mechanisms of paracellular barrier formation by demonstrating that defined non-conserved residues in TM3 and ECL2 of classic claudins contribute to the formation of TJ strands with differing ultrastructures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7764275>Structure determination of N-terminal-blocked peptide from hog kidney aldose 1-epimerase by tandem mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>The blocked-N-terminal structure of hog kidney aldose 1-epimerase (mutarotase, EC 5.1.3.3) was determined to be Ac-Val-Ser-Val--Arg-Ser-Val--Gly-Asp... by a coupling of conventional methods (enzymatic digestion, amino acid analysis, and Edman sequencing) and tandem mass spectrometry.

These variants were constructed to interrupt a chain of tightly bound water molecules that was assumed to facilitate proton transfer from the cytoplasm to the secondary quinone Q(B) [Baciou, L., and Michel, H. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 7967-7972]. However, the amino acid exchanges Pro L209 --> Tyr and Pro L209 -->  do not interrupt the water chain. Both aromatic side chains are oriented away from this water chain and interact with three surrounding polar side chains (Asp L213,  L226, and Glu H173) which are displaced by up to 2.6 A. The conformational changes induced by the bulky aromatic rings of Tyr L209 and  L209 lead to unexpected displacements of Q(B) compared to the wild-type protein. In the structure of the Pro L209 --> Tyr variant, Q(B) is shifted by approximately 4 A and is now located at a position similar to that reported for the wild-type reaction center after illumination [Stowell, M. H. B., et al. (1997) Science 276, 812-816]. In the Pro L209 -->  variant, the electron density map reveals an intermediate Q(B) position between the binding sites of the wild-type protein in the dark and the Pro L209 --> Tyr protein. In the Pro L209 --> Glu reaction center, the carboxylic side chain of Glu L209 is located within the water chain, and the binding site of Q(B) remains unchanged compared to the wild-type structure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7332615>Myocardial infarction.

Two peptides, the completely active carboxyl terminal heptapeptide from CCK (CCK-7), whose sequence is Tyr-Met-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp--NH2, and the carboxyl terminal heptapeptide from cerulein (CER-7) which has the same sequence as for CCK-7 except for replacement of Met 2 with a  2, both stimulate peripheral receptors in gall bladder, pancreas, and pylorus in the gastrointestinal system. In contrast, two other very similar peptides, the last four residues of CCK (CCK-4) whose sequence is Trp-Met-Asp--NH2, and the carboxyl terminal hexapeptide of little gastrin (LGA-6, Tyr-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp--NH2, i.e., residue 2 deleted relative to CCK-7 and CER-7 sequences), interact specifically with gastrin receptors and not at all or very weakly with peripheral receptors. All of these peptides react with CCK receptors in the central nervous system, especially in forebrain. The results in the GI tract suggest that the peptides active on peripheral receptors adopt structures that are significantly different from those of the peptides that interact with gastrin receptors. We have generated all of the many low  conformations for each of these peptides. By retaining only the conformations that are the same for peptides within the same group and then rejecting those resulting conformations that are the same for the peptides in the two different groups, we can greatly reduce the possible active conformations for the peptides within each class.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12185075>Mutations in the extracellular amino-terminal domain of the NK2 neurokinin receptor abolish cAMP signaling but preserve intracellular calcium responses.</a></h2><p>By combining real time measurements of agonist binding, by fluorescence resonance  transfer, and of subsequent responses, we proposed previously that the neurokinin NK2 receptor preexists in equilibrium between three states: inactive, calcium-triggering, and cAMP-producing. (24) and (26) of the NK2 receptor extracellular domain are considered to interact with neuropeptide agonists based on the reduction of affinity when they are substituted by alanine. Using fluorescence resonance  transfer, we now quantify the binding kinetics of two Texas Red-modified neurokinin A agonists to the fluorescent wild-type (Y-NK2wt) and the mutant (Y-NK2mut) receptor carrying (24) --> Ala and (26) --> Ala mutations. TR1-neurokinin A binds with a fast component and a slow component to the Y-NK2wt receptor and triggers both a calcium and a cAMP response. In contrast, on the mutant receptor, it binds in a single fast step with a lower apparent affinity and activates only the calcium response. Another agonist, TRC4-neurokinin A, binds to both wild-type and mutant receptors in a single fast step, with similar affinities and kinetics and promotes only calcium signaling. Kinetic modeling of ligand binding and receptor interconversions is carried out to analyze phenotypic changes in terms of binding alterations or changes in the transitions between conformational states. We show that the binding and response properties of the Y-NK2mut receptor are best described according to a phenotype where a reduction of the transition between the inactive and the active states occurs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18211608>Non-invasive monitoring of oxidative skin stress by ultraweak photon emission (UPE)-measurement. I: mechanisms of UPE of biological materials.</a></h2><p>Oxidation of proteins and amino acids is associated with generation of ultraweak photon emission (UPE), which may be used to assess oxidative processes in the skin in a non-invasive way. This first part of a series of reports addresses the physicochemical basis of oxidation-induced UPE in the skin, with a special focus on the contribution of amino acid oxidation.UPE of biological samples and protein/amino acid solutions following oxidation with H(2)O(2) in the presence of Fe(2+) was recorded using a sensitive photomultiplier system. Signals were analyzed with regard to overall signal intensity and spectral distribution.Increasing concentrations of H(2)O(2) in aqueous bovine serum albumin solutions induced linearly correlated UPE and protein carbonyl compounds, with a substantially higher sensitivity for the measurement of UPE. In single amino acid solutions, strong UPE signals were generated by oxidation from , Trp, His, and Cys, and weak signals from Lys and . Analysis of reaction products by MS revealed high oxidative material turnover for Cys and His, whereas barely detectable oxidative material turnover seems to be sufficient to generate a UPE signal of similar strength from Trp and . Combination of different amino acids did not result in a simple addition of individual oxidation-induced UPE signals, but in interactions ranging from antagonism to clear synergism. Synergism was evident between Trp- and UPE-generating amino acids such as , Cys, and His, with the strongest synergism by far observed between Trp and His. The strikingly different individual UPE spectra of His and Trp, despite being of comparable overall strength, were congruent with a pure Trp UPE spectrum after combining His with Trp in solution, indicating  transfer between both amino acids. Combination of Trp and DNA, which also gives UPE signals following oxidation, did not result in a synergistically enhanced or antagonized overall UPE signal, but in a simple addition of individual UPE signals.Measurement of UPE could be proven to be a highly sensitive method to assess oxidative processes in biological molecules. The reported data indicate that UPE generated by oxidation stressed skin is mainly due to non-fluorescent photon emission via Trp, whereby Trp acts as an  receptor from other excited species of oxidation-modified amino acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28201818>Collective repacking reveals that the structures of protein cores are uniquely specified by steric repulsive interactions.</a></h2><p>Protein core repacking is a standard test of protein modeling software. A recent study of six different modeling software packages showed that they are more successful at predicting side chain conformations of core compared to surface residues. All the modeling software tested have multicomponent  functions, typically including contributions from solvation, electrostatics, hydrogen bonding and Lennard-Jones interactions in addition to statistical terms based on observed protein structures. We investigated to what extent a simplified  function that includes only stereochemical constraints and repulsive hard-sphere interactions can correctly repack protein cores. For single residue and collective repacking, the hard-sphere model accurately recapitulates the observed side chain conformations for Ile, Leu, , , Trp, Tyr and Val. This result shows that there are no alternative, sterically allowed side chain conformations of core residues. Analysis of the same set of protein cores using the Rosetta software suite revealed that the hard-sphere model and Rosetta perform equally well on Ile, Leu, ,  and Val; the hard-sphere model performs better on Trp and Tyr and Rosetta performs better on Ser. We conclude that the high prediction accuracy in protein cores obtained by protein modeling software and our simplified hard-sphere approach reflects the high density of protein cores and dominance of steric repulsion.© The Author 2017.

Compared with other EAA, existing recommendations for the requirements of Arg, Ile, and Val are few and inconsistent. Four multiparous Holstein dairy cows at 22±6 wk of lactation received 4 treatments (duodenal infusions of 445±22.4 g/d of an EAA mixture complementing a low-protein diet in a 4×4 Latin square design with a period length of 1 wk). The control treatment provided a balanced supply (in % of PDIE) of 5.1% Arg, 5.2% Ile, and 5.9% Val, whereas in the 3 subsequent treatments of -Arg, -Ile, and -Val, the concentrations of these 3 EAA were reduced to 3.5, 4.1, and 4.5%, respectively. All treatments were made isonitrogenous and were balanced to provide 7 other EAA (Lys, Met, His, Leu, , , and Trp), according to the recommendations described in the literature. Combined, the diet and the infusions provided 14.3±0.1% crude protein on a dry matter basis, and 66.0±1.2 g of PDIE/Mcal of net  for lactation. Neither dry matter intake (19.2 kg/d) nor milk yield (30.4±0.4 kg/d) was affected by treatments. The -Arg and -Ile treatments did not modify milk protein synthesis or the efficiency of N utilization. However, the -Val treatment decreased milk protein content by 4.9% and milk crude protein content by 4.3%, and tended to decrease the efficiency of N use for milk protein yield by 3.7% (compared with the control). These effects of Val were related to a decrease in the plasma concentration of Val as well as a trend toward decreasing plasma concentrations of Met, His, and the sum of all EAA and nonessential AA in the -Val treatment, which indicates a different utilization of all AA in response to the Val deficit. The deletion of Ile, compared with the deletion of Val, tended to decrease the milk protein-to-fat ratio by 3.8%. In conclusion, the supply of Arg at 3.5% of PDIE was not limiting for milk protein synthesis. The slight effect on the milk protein-to-fat ratio caused by decreasing the supply of Ile suggests a need to reevaluate the Ile requirement more precisely. A low Val supply could be limiting for milk protein synthesis, provided that the requirements of Lys, Met, and His are met.Copyright © 2013 American Dairy Science Association.

Ruminally cannulated Holstein steers were maintained in metabolism crates, fed the same basal diet (73% soyhulls, 19% alfalfa, DM basis), and given the same intraruminal infusions (400 g/d acetate; to supply  without increasing microbial protein supply). Treatments were infused abomasally. In Exp. 1, steers (200 kg) were provided 1) water, 2) 10 g/d of methionine (MET), or 3) a mixture of 10 essential AA (10AA). Nitrogen retention (13.7 g/d) was greatest (P < .05) for steers receiving 10AA. Steers receiving MET (7.9 g/d) had greater (P < .05) N retention than control steers (5.4 g/d). In Exp. 2, steers (200 kg) were provided 10AA or 10AA with L-Lys deleted from the mixture. Steers receiving 10AA tended (P < .09) to have greater N retention (19.0 g/d) than those receiving no lysine (16.3 g/d). In Exp. 3, steers (194 kg) were provided 10AA or 10AA with L- deleted from the mixture. Nitrogen retention was not affected by removal of threonine. In Exp. 4, steers (152 kg) were provided 10AA or 10AA with L-His, L-Trp, L-Arg, L-, or branched-chain AA (L-Leu, L-Ile, and L-Val) removed. Nitrogen retention was reduced (P < .05) by removal of either L-His or the branched-chain AA.

The calculated free  differences of denaturation for G88V and A69T were -1.1 and -2.8 kcal/mol, respectively. These values are in good agreement with the experimental values. The free  differences divided into electrostatic and van der Waals components were analyzed. These two mutants are mainly destabilized due to van der Waals interactions. There is little difference between the electrostatic contribution to the free  change in the native state and that in the denatured state. In each mutant structure, a small cavity appears in the vicinity of the perturbed residue. It is suggested that intramolecular van der Waals interactions of the mutants are weaker than those of the wild-type. Furthermore, analyses of the contributions of each residue near the perturbed residue and of water to the free  difference of denaturation suggest that the interaction between water and the perturbed residue plays a very important role in the stability of staphylococcal nuclease, and that a small hydrophobic core consisting of the three aromatic rings (Tyr-27, -34, -76) and the side chain of Met-32 is also important for the stability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29462375>Effects of Ginkgo biloba leaves (Ginkgo biloba) and Ginkgo biloba extract on nutrient and  utilization of broilers.</a></h2><p>An experiment using 112 21-day-old male Arbor Acres broilers that were randomly allocated to 7 treatments with 8 replicates in a completely randomized design was conducted to assess the effects of Ginkgo biloba leaves (Ginkgo biloba, GL) and Ginkgo biloba extract (EGB) on utilization of nutrients of broiler chickens. The dietary treatments were corn-soybean meal based diets: 1) T1, control diet; 2) T2, T1 + 20 g/kg GL; 3) T3, T1 + 40 g/kg GL; 4) T4, T1 + 60 g/kg GL; 5) T5, T1 + 0.4 g/kg EGB; 6) T6, T1 + 0.8 g/kg EGB; and 7) T7, T1 + 1.2 g/kg EGB. Endogenous losses were obtained from another 16 broilers. Excreta samples were collected to analyze the dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), ether extract (EE), crude protein (CP), gross  (GE), and amino acids (AA), and GE was analyzed for computation of AME and TME. As compared with those of the control treatment, the apparent digestibility (AD) and true digestibility (TD) of EE, CP, , Val, Ile, Leu, , Lys, His, and Arg were quadratically (P < 0.05) increased; moreover, the AD and TD of Met was linearly (P < 0.05) increased as the concentration of the EGB in the diet increased. Increasing GL from 0 to 60 g/kg of diet linearly (P < 0.05) increased the AD and TD of EE, , Val, Leu, His, and Met and tended (0.05 < P < 0.1) to increase the TME, TMEn, and Arg. Supplementation of EGB increased (P < 0.05) AD and TD of EE, , Val, Ile, Leu, , His, and Arg and tended (0.05 < P < 0.1) to increase Lys as compared with those in the GL-supplemented groups. Dietary supplementation of GL and EGB improved the utilization of nutrients of broiler chickens in a dose-dependent manner, and the optimum supplementation levels of GL or EGB in the diet of broilers was 60 or 0.8 g/kg of diet, respectively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10215884>Hydrophobic sequences can substitute for the wild-type N-terminal sequence of cystatin A (stefin A) in tight binding to cysteine proteinases selection of high-affinity N-terminal region variants by phage display.</a></h2><p>A phage-display library of the cysteine-proteinase inhibitor, cystatin A, was constructed in which variants with the four N-terminal amino acids randomly mutated were expressed on the surface of filamenteous phage. Screening of this library for binding to papain gave predominantly variants with a glycine residue in position 4. This finding is in agreement with previous conclusions that glycine in this position is essential for tight binding of cystatin A to cysteine proteinases by allowing optimal interaction of the N-terminal region of the inhibitor with the enzyme. In contrast, the first three residues of the variants obtained by the screening were more variable. Two variants were identified with similar affinities for papain as the wild-type inhibitor, but with these residues, Val--- or Ile-Leu-Leu, differing appreciably from those of the wild-type, Met-Ile-Pro. Other sequences of the N-terminal region, presumably mainly hydrophobic, can thus substitute for the wild-type sequence and contribute similar  to the inhibitor-proteinase interaction. The two variants binding tightly to papain differed in their affinity for cathepsin B, demonstrating that cystatin variants with increased selectivity for a particular target cysteine proteinase can be obtained by phage-display technology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604772>Amino Acid and Sugar Catabolism in the Marine Bacterium  DSM 17395 from an Energetic Viewpoint.</a></h2><p>Growth energetics and metabolic efficiency contribute to the lifestyle and habitat imprint of microorganisms. Roseobacters constitute one of the most abundant and successful marine bacterioplankton groups. Here, we reflect on energetics and metabolic efficiency of  DSM 17395, a versatile heterotrophic roseobacter. Fourteen different substrates (5 sugars, 9 amino acids) and their degradation pathways were assessed for energetic efficiencies based on catabolic ATP yields, calculated from net-formed ATP and reducing equivalents. The latter were converted into ATP employing the most divergent coupling ratios (i.e., ions ATP) currently known for FF ATP synthases in heterotrophic bacteria. Catabolic ATP yields of the studied pathways in  varied ∼3-fold. Actual free  costs for ATP synthesis were estimated to 81.6 (3.3 ions ATP) or 104.2 (4.3 ions ATP) kJ per mol ATP, yielding an average thermodynamic efficiency of ∼37.7% or ∼29.5%. Growth performance (rates, yields) and carbon assimilation efficiency were determined for  growing in process-controlled bioreactors with ten different single substrates (Glc, Man, Nag, , Trp, His, Lys, , Val, or Leu) and with two defined substrate mixtures. Carbon assimilation efficiencies into biomass ranged from ∼28% to 61%, with His/Trp and /Leu yielding the lowest and highest levels. These efficiencies correlated with catabolic and ATP yields only to some extent. Substrate-specific metabolic demands and/or functions, as well as the composition of the substrate mixtures, apparently affected the energetic costs of growth. This includes energetic burden associated with, e.g., slow growth, stress, and/or production of tropodithietic acid. Heterotrophic members of the bacterioplankton serve the marine ecosystem by transforming organic matter, an activity that is governed by the bacterial growth efficiencies procurable under given environmental conditions. In marine ecology, this causal connection is accounted for by the concept of bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) that refers to the carbon assimilation efficiency within natural communities. The here studied marine bacterium  DSM 17395 is a copiotrophic representative of the globally abundant  group and the investigated 15 catabolic pathways are widespread among these marine heterotrophs. Combining pathway-specific catabolic ATP yields with in-depth quantitative physiological data could (i) provide a new baseline to study growth energetics and efficiency in further  group members and other copiotrophic marine bacteria in productive coastal ecosystems, and (ii) contribute to a better understanding of factors controlling BGE (incl. the additional energetic burden arising from widespread secondary metabolite formation) from laboratory studies with pure cultures.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20308399>Effect of the duration of prefeeding on amino acid digestibility of wheat distillers dried grains with solubles in broiler chicken.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to determine the effect of the duration of prefeeding on prececal amino acid (AA) digestibility of wheat distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) in broilers. The experimental diets with DDGS at levels of 0, 10, and 20% were offered ad libitum for 7, 5, and 3 d, starting on 14, 16, and 18 d of age. Titanium dioxide was used as an indigestible marker. Six pens of 10 birds were allocated to each treatment. Digesta was sampled on a pen basis from the distal two-thirds of the intestine section between Meckel's diverticulum and 2 cm anterior to the ileo-ceca-colonic junction. Ingested and digested amounts of AA were determined for each pen. Digestibility of AA in the diets was not significantly affected by the duration of prefeeding but was significantly reduced by inclusion of DDGS. Digestibility of AA in DDGS was determined by using a linear regression approach. The digestibility of AA in DDGS ranged from 76% (Arg, 5 d of feeding) to 33% (Asp, 3 d of feeding). There was no significant effect of prefeeding time on AA digestibility of DDGS. Lysine digestibility of DDGS was 72%. The mean digestibility of the AA Arg, Cys, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, , , and Val of DDGS across the 3 prefeeding times was 66%.

The thermal tolerance and bioefficacy of a phytase product with a thermoprotective coating [coated phytase (C-phytase)] was compared in mash and pelleted diets to a traditional, uncoated phytase (U-phytase) added to a negative control (NC) diet, formulated with reduced dietary Ca and P, and compared with a corn-soybean meal based positive control (POC) diet. Growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and third metacarpal bone characteristics were response variables. Weaned pigs (n = 56; 8.20 ± 0.5 kg initial BW; 28 d of age) were individually housed and randomly allotted to 1 of 7 diets for 21 d. The diets were 1) POC mash, 2) NC mash, 3) NC pelleted at 90°C, 4) NC mash + 500 U/kg U-phytase, 5) NC mash + 500 U/kg C-phytase, 6) NC + 500 U/kg C-phytase pelleted at 80°C, and 7) NC + 500 U/kg C-phytase pelleted at 90°C. The POC and NC diets were formulated to be isoenergetic and isolysinic. The content of Ca and available P was 1.01 and 0.40% and 0.83 and 0.22% in the POC and NC diets, respectively. Pig BW and feed intake were measured on d 7, 14, and 21, and feces were collected for 2 d. On d 21, pigs were killed and ileal digesta and the third metacarpal bone collected. Pigs fed POC had greater (P < 0.05) ADG, G:F, P digestibility, and bone mineralization but lower (P < 0.01)  digestibility than pigs fed NC. Pelleting the NC diet did not improve performance, nutrient digestibility, or P use. Adding the U-phytase to NC mash diet increased (P < 0.05) ADG, G:F, apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of CP and Ile, Leu, , , Val, and Ser, and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of P compared with pigs fed NC. Pigs fed C-phytase in NC mash diets had increased (P < 0.05) G:F and an AID of CP and AA and ATTD of P compared with pigs fed NC but not different than pigs fed U-phytase NC mash diets. Pigs fed pelleted NC diet with C-phytase had a greater (P < 0.05) ATTD of P and  than pigs fed mash NC diet with C-phytase but had similar growth performance, AID of CP and AA, and bone mineralization to pigs fed U-phytase.

Infectious diseases repartition AA away from protein retention toward processes involved in immune defense, thus impacting AA utilization in pigs. The current study sought to evaluate the effects of disease induced by a live pathogen on plasma free AA flux and whole-body nitrogen (N) utilization. Twenty gilts (BW 9.4 ± 0.9 kg) were surgically catheterized into the jugular vein, individually housed in metabolism crates, and feed-restricted (550 g/d). Intramuscular inoculation of a live field strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was used to induce disease. Whole-body N-balance was conducted across 3 d both before PRRSV inoculation (PRRSV-) and also after PRRSV inoculation (PRRSV+). At the end of each N-balance period, a bolus dose of a labeled [U-13C, U-15N]-AA mixture (Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, , , Trp, Val, and Gln) was infused intravenously, followed by serial blood collection for measurement of isotopic enrichment. A double exponential model was fitted with plasma enrichment data for each pig and each AA, and equation parameters were used to estimate plasma free AA flux and pool size. Apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of dietary N was determined using the slaughter technique and an indigestible marker. Blood chemistry, hematology, body temperature, and serum viremia indicated that PRRSV induced effective immune response in pigs (P < 0.05). Challenge with PRRSV reduced the AID of N (P < 0.05), but had no effect on apparent total tract digestibility of dietary  (P = 0.12). Plasma flux (µmol/kg BW/h) for Met and  was increased by PRRSV infection (P < 0.05). A strong tendency of increased Val flux was observed in PRRSV+ pigs (P = 0.06). Infection with PRRSV increased the pool size for Lys, Met, , Trp, Leu, Val, and Gln (P < 0.05). Collectively, these results suggest that PRRSV alters the utilization of dietary N and AA flux, as well as pool size, in growing pigs. The increase in  and Met flux in PRRSV+ pigs may be associated with enhanced utilization of these AA for the synthesis of immune system metabolites and increased catabolism of these AA. Thus, dietary Met, , and Val requirements may increase in pigs infected with PRRSV, relative to the requirements for other AA.© The Author(s) 2019.

This study determined the effect of different AA profiles within a constant supplemental MP level on whole-body  and N partitioning in dairy cattle. Five rumen-fistulated Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (2.8 ± 0.4 lactations; 81 ± 11 d in milk; mean ± standard deviation) were randomly assigned to a 5 × 5 Latin square design in which each experimental period consisted of 5 d of continuous abomasal infusion followed by 2 d of rest. A total mixed ration consisting of 58% corn silage, 16% alfalfa hay, and 26% concentrate (dry matter basis) was formulated to meet 100 and 83% of net  and MP requirements, respectively, and was fed at 90% of ad libitum intake by individual cow. Abomasal infusion treatments were saline (SAL) or 562 g/d of essential AA delivered in 4 profiles where individual AA content corresponded to their relative content in casein. The profiles were (1) a complete essential amino acid mixture (EAAC), (2) Ile, Leu, and Val (ILV), (3) His, Ile, Leu, Met, , Trp, Val (GR1+ILV), and (4) Arg, His, Lys, Met, , , Trp (GR1+ALT). The experiment was conducted in climate respiration chambers to determine  and N balance in conjunction with milk production and composition, digestibility, and plasma constituents. Compared with SAL, infusion of EAAC increased milk, protein, and lactose yield, increased  retained as body protein, and did not affect milk N efficiency. Total N intake and urine N output was higher with all AA infusions relative to SAL. Compared with EAAC, infusions of GR1+ILV and GR1+ALT produced the same milk yield and the same yield and content of milk fat, protein, and lactose, and had similar  and N retention. Milk N efficiency was not different between EAAC and GR1+ILV, but was lower with GR1+ALT compared with EAAC, and tended to be lower with GR1+ALT compared with GR1+ILV. Infusion of ILV tended to decrease dry matter intake compared with the other AA infusions. Milk production and composition was not different between ILV and SAL. Compared with EAAC, infusion of ILV decreased or tended to decrease milk, protein, and lactose yields and milk protein content, and increased milk fat and lactose content. Milk N efficiency decreased with ILV compared with SAL, EAAC, and GR1+ILV. Milk urea concentration was not affected by essential amino acid (EAA) infusions. Plasma urea concentration did not differ between EAAC and SAL, tended to increase with ILV and GR1+ILV over SAL, and increased with GR1+ALT compared with EAAC and SAL. In conclusion, removing Arg, Lys, and  or removing Ile, Leu, and Val from a complete EAA profile when the total amount of EAA infused remained constant did not impair milk production, but milk N efficiency decreased when Ile, Leu, and Val were absent. Infusion of only Ile, Leu, and Val decreased milk protein yield and content and reduced milk N efficiency compared with a complete EAA profile.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

In Exp. 1, 15 ileal-cannulated pigs (50.5 ± 2.9 kg BW) were allotted to 5 diets in a 2-period incompletely randomized design. Pigs were provided a cornstarch N-free diet (CST) or a diet containing 5% inulin (INU), carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC), microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), or Solka-Floc (SFC). Apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of DM, ash, and GE were greater ( < 0.05) in the MCC and SFC diets than in the INU and CMC diets. Apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, carbohydrates (CHO), and GE and the DE content in the CST and INU diets were greater ( < 0.01) than in the CMC, MCC, and SFC diets. Hindgut disappearance of DM, CHO, and GE in the INU diet was greater ( < 0.05) than in the other N-free diets. The ileal endogenous flow of His, Ile, Leu, Met, , Val, and all dispensable AA in the CMC diet was greater ( < 0.05) than in the other diets. In Exp. 2, 6 ileal-cannulated pigs were allotted to 3 diets containing either a corn-soybean meal control diet or the control diet with 5% INU or CMC in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design. Standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of Ala, Arg, Asp, Cys, Gly, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, , Ser, , and Val were greater ( < 0.05) in the CMC diet than in the control and INU diets. Incorporation of 5% INU or CMC in the control diet reduced ( < 0.01) the AID of arabinoxylan and insoluble and total NSP. The ATTD of NSP and cellulose and the hindgut disappearance of NSP, β-glucan, and cellulose in the CMC diet were less ( < 0.01) than in the control and INU diets. Inclusion of 5% INU in the diet increased ( < 0.01) hindgut fermentation of insoluble and total NSP compared with the control and CMC diets. In conclusion, depending on the viscosity and fermentability of the NSP, different sources will have different effects on nutrient digestibility and hindgut fermentation. Addition of 5% INU to a corn-soybean meal diet reduced digestibility of the NSP component in the ileum and increased hindgut fermentation of total NSP. In contrast, the inclusion of CMC increased the AID and SID of the diet and reduced total tract digestion and hindgut fermentation of NSP component. Carboxymethylcellulose sodium is not recommended as a source of synthetic fiber in a N-free diet to determine the SID of AA of diets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25568365>The efficacy of a new 6-phytase obtained from Buttiauxella spp. expressed in Trichoderma reesei on digestibility of amino acids, , and nutrients in pigs fed a diet based on corn, soybean meal, wheat middlings, and corn distillers' dried grains with solubles.</a></h2><p>Sixteen cannulated pigs were used to evaluate the effect of a new 6-phytase derived from Buttiauxella spp. and expressed in Trichoderma reesei on apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of AA and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, N, Ca, P, Na, Mg, K, Cl, and . Pigs were fed 4 diets for 2 periods in a crossover design. Within each period, there were 4 blocks of 4 pigs per block with each diet represented within each block. The average initial BW in periods 1 and 2 were 22 and 30 kg, respectively. Each period lasted 9 d with fecal collection on d 5 and 6 and a 12-h ileal digesta collection on d 7, 8, and 9. Pigs received a daily feed allowance of approximately 4.5% of their BW. The experimental diets were based on corn, soybean meal, wheat middlings, and corn distillers dried grain with solubles. Phytase was added at 0; 500; 1,000; or 2,000 phytase units/kg of diet to a basal diet that contained 205, 15, 5.4, and 10 g of CP, Lys, total P (1.6 g of nonphytate P), and Ca/kg diet, respectively. The addition of phytase improved (P < 0.05) AID of DM, N, Ca, and P. Increasing phytase supplementation linearly and quadratically increased (P < 0.05) AID of P and Ca, respectively, with AID of Ca showing a tendency for a linear increase (P = 0.053). Phytase supplementation of the basal diet improved (P < 0.05) AID of P from 46 to 62%. Phytase supplementation increased (P < 0.05) ATTD of DM, N, Ca, P, Mg, K, and . Contrasts showed that phytase supplementation of the basal diet increased (P < 0.05) AID for 8 indispensable AA (Arg, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, , , and Val), 6 dispensable AA (Ala, Asp, Cys, Glu, Ser, and Tyr), as well as for total AA. Furthermore, phytase supplementation to the basal diet showed a tendency (P < 0.10) to increase ileal digestibility of Gly. Ileal digestibility of Met, Trp, and Pro were not affected by phytase supplementation. Increasing the level of phytase supplementation resulted in linear increases (P < 0.05) in AID of 6 indispensable AA (Arg, Ile, Leu, Lys, , and Val) and 1 dispensable AA (Asp) with 4 AA (His, Cys, Glu, and Tyr) showing a tendency for linear increase (P < 0.10) in AID of AA. The results from this study showed that in addition to increasing P and Ca utilization, the new Buttiauxella 6-phytase expressed in Trichoderma reesei enhanced ileal digestibility of N and several AA in growing pigs in a dose-dependent manner.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9181078>Purification, physicochemical characterization and biological properties of a lectin from Erythrina velutina forma aurantiaca seeds.</a></h2><p>A lectin was purified from seeds of Erythrina velutina forma aurantiaca by affinity chromatography on cross-linked guar gum. The lectin is a potent agglutinin for human (minimal concentration of protein able to cause visible agglutination of a 2% erythrocyte suspension varying from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml), rabbit (4 micrograms/ml) and chicken erythrocytes (8 micrograms/ml) but presented low activity against cow (250 micrograms/ml) or sheep (333 micrograms/ml) blood cells. Hemagglutination of human O+ erythrocytes was inhibited by D-lactose (0.2 mM) > D-galactose (0.8 mM) > D-raffinose (2.1 mM). At pH 7.5, chromatography on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column showed that the lectin was primarily a dimer (56.0 kDa) composed of two identical subunits (31.6 kDa each). A small amount of a tetrameric form was also apparently present. The lectin is a glycoprotein (7.3% carbohydrate), has a pI of 4.5, contains high levels of acidic (Asp and Glu, 64.2 and 51.6 residues/mol, respectively) and hydroxy amino acids (Ser and , 42.9 and 38.5 residues/mol, respectively) but relatively low amounts of sulfur amino acids (Cys and Met, 1.0 and 5.0 residues/mol, respectively) and has an N-terminal sequence of Val-Glu--Ile/Leu-Pro--Ser. Its hemagglutinating activity was abolished by heating at 70 degrees C for 10 min. The activation  (delta G') required for denaturation measured by loss of hemagglutination activity was 24.87 kcal/mol. In rats, the purified lectin (100 micrograms) induced neutrophil migration into the peritoneal cavity (3.7 +/- 0.6 x 10(6) neutrophils/ml) or into the air pouch (2.75 +/- 0.25 x 10(6) neutrophils/ml), 8 and 10 times greater than the negative control, respectively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9788944>Structural and dynamic properties of the homodimeric hemoglobin from Scapharca inaequivalvis -72-->Ile mutant: molecular dynamics simulation, low temperature visible absorption spectroscopy, and resonance Raman spectroscopy studies.</a></h2><p>Molecular dynamics simulations, low temperature visible absorption spectroscopy, and resonance Raman spectroscopy have been performed on a mutant of the Scapharca inaequivalvis homodimeric hemoglobin, where residue threonine 72, at the subunit interface, has been substituted by isoleucine. Molecular dynamics simulation indicates that in the -72-->Ile mutant several residues that have been shown to play a role in ligand binding fluctuate around orientations and distances similar to those observed in the x-ray structure of the CO derivative of the native hemoglobin, although the overall structure remains in the T state. Visible absorption spectroscopy data indicate that in the deoxy form the Soret band is less asymmetric in the mutant than in the native protein, suggesting a more planar heme structure; moreover, these data suggest a similar heme-solvent interaction in both the liganded and unliganded states of the mutant protein, at variance with that observed in the native protein. The "conformation sensitive" band III of the deoxy mutant protein is shifted to lower  by >100 cm-1 with respect to the native one, about one-half of that observed in the low temperature photoproducts of both proteins, indicating a less polar or more hydrophobic heme environment. Resonance Raman spectroscopy data show a slight shift of the iron-proximal histidine stretching mode of the deoxy mutant toward lower frequency with respect to the native protein, which can be interpreted in terms of either a change in packing of the phenyl ring of -97, as also observed from the simulation, or a loss of water in the heme pocket. In line with this latter interpretation, the number of water molecules that dynamically enters the intersubunit interface, as calculated by the molecular dynamics simulation, is lower in the mutant than in the native protein. The 10-ns photoproduct for the carbonmonoxy mutant derivative has a higher iron-proximal histidine stretching frequency than does the native protein. This suggests a subnanosecond relaxation that is slowed in the mutant, consistent with a stabilization of the R structure. Taken together, the molecular dynamics and the spectroscopic data indicate that the higher oxygen affinity displayed by the -72-->Ile mutant is mainly due to a local perturbation in the dimer interface that propagates to the heme region, perturbing the polarity of the heme environment and propionate interactions. These changes are consistent with a destabilization of the T state and a stabilization of the R state in the mutant relative to the native protein.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11420432>Effect of the N2 residue on the stability of the alpha-helix for all 20 amino acids.</a></h2><p>N2 is the second position in the alpha-helix. All 20 amino acids were placed in the N2 position of a synthetic helical peptide (CH(3)CO-[AXAAAAKAAAAKAAGY]-NH(2)) and the helix content was measured by circular dichroism spectroscopy at 273K. The dependence of peptide helicity on N2 residue identity has been used to determine a free- scale by analysis with a modified Lifson-Roig helix-coil theory that includes a parameter for the N2  (n2). The rank order of DeltaDeltaG((relative to Ala)) is Glu(-), Asp(-) > Ala > Glu(0), Leu, Val, Gln, , Ile, Ser, Met, Asp(0), His(0), Arg, Cys, Lys,  > Asn, > Gly, His(+), Pro, Tyr. The results correlate very well with N2 propensities in proteins, moderately well with N1 and helix interior preferences, and not at all with N-cap preferences. The strongest energetic effects result from interactions with the helix dipole, which favors negative charges at the helix N terminus. Hydrogen bonds to side chains at N2, such as Gln, Ser, and , are weak, despite occurring frequently in protein crystal structures, in contrast to the N-cap position. This is because N-cap hydrogen bonds are close to linear, whereas N2 hydrogen bonds have poor geometry. These results can be used to modify protein stability rationally, help design helices, and improve prediction of helix location and stability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31250878>Postprandial insulin and nutrient concentrations in lipopolysaccharide-challenged growing pigs reared in thermoneutral and high ambient temperatures1.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the associated effects of ambient temperature and  caused by repeated administration of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on insulin, energy, and AA metabolism. Twenty-eight pigs were assigned to one of the two thermal conditions: thermoneutral (24 °C) or high ambient temperature (30 °C). The experimental period lasted 17 d, which was divided into a 7-d period without LPS (days -7 to -1), and a subsequent 10-d LPS period (days 1 to 10) in which pigs were administered 5 repeated injections of LPS at 2-d intervals. Postprandial profiles of plasma insulin and nutrients were evaluated through serial blood samples taken on days -4 (P0), 4 (P1), and 8 (P2). Before the LPS-challenge (P0), postprandial concentrations of glucose, lactate, Gln, Ile, Leu, , Tyr, and Val were greater in pigs kept at 24 °C than at 30 °C (P < 0.05). In contrast, Arg, Asp, Gly, His, and Met postprandial concentrations at P0 were lower at 24 °C than at 30 °C (P < 0.05). At both 24 and 30 °C conditions, pigs had greater postprandial concentrations of insulin (P < 0.01) and lower concentrations of NEFA (P < 0.01) and α-amino nitrogen (P < 0.05) at P1 and P2 than at P0. Compared with P0, postprandial concentrations of glucose were greater (P < 0.05) at P1 in pigs kept at 24 °C, and at P1 and P2 in pigs kept at 30 °C. At both ambient temperatures, pigs had lower (P < 0.05) postprandial concentrations of Ala, Gly, His, Ile, Leu, Pro, Ser, , Trp, and Val at P1 and P2 than at P0. Arginine postprandial concentration at P1 was lower than at P0 in pigs kept at 24 °C (P < 0.05), whereas no difference was observed in pigs at 30 °C. Relative to P0, Gln and Tyr concentrations were lower at P1 and P2 in pigs kept at 24 °C (P < 0.01), whereas lower Gln concentration was observed only at P2 (P < 0.01) and lower Tyr only at P1 (P < 0.01) in pigs kept at 30 °C. Our study shows a hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic state in LPS-challenged pigs and a greater magnitude of this response in pigs kept at 30 °C. Furthermore, LPS caused important changes in BCAA, His, , and Trp profiles, suggesting the role these AA in supporting the inflammatory response. Finally, our results suggest that LPS-induced effects on postprandial profiles of specific AA (Arg, Gln, , and Tyr) may be modulated by ambient temperature.© The Author(s) 2019.

The cells are flagellated, strictly anaerobic cocci that grow optimally at 85 degrees C and 5.4 g NaCl l(-1). The strain grows heterotrophically on complex proteinaceous substrates or on appropriate salts plus amino acid mixtures and is also able to utilize maltose, starch, and pyruvate. Elemental sulfur could be replaced by cystine or thioglycollate. The range of temperatures allowing growth is from 60 to 90 degrees C; the pH supporting growth ranges from 5 to 8 (optimum, pH 7). Strain WT1 grew in a defined medium containing amino acids as the sole carbon and  sources. The required amino acids were: Arg, His, Ile, Leu, , Ser, , Trp, Tyr, and Val. Strain WT1 showed sensitivity to rifampicin. DNA G+C content was 50.4 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequence encoding the 16S rRNA gene indicated that this isolate is a member of the Thermococcales. DNA/DNA hybridization studies revealed no similarity to several species of Thermococcus and Pyrococcus, with the exception of Thermococcus zilligii. Based on the reported results, we propose strain WT1 as a new species to be named Thermococcus waiotapuensis sp. nov.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26982101>Probing binding mechanism of interleukin-6 and olokizumab: in silico design of potential lead antibodies for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.</a></h2><p>Computer-aided antibody engineering has been successful in the design of new biologics for disease diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a well-recognized drug target for various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and psoriasis, was investigated in silico to design potential lead antibodies. Here, crystal structure of IL-6 along with monoclonal antibody olokizumab was explored to predict antigen-antibody (Ag - Ab)-interacting residues using DiscoTope, Paratome, and PyMOL. Tyr56, Tyr103 in heavy chain and Gly30, Ile31 in light chain of olokizumab were mutated with residues Ser, , Tyr, Trp, and . A set of 899 mutant macromolecules were designed, and binding affinity of these macromolecules to IL-6 was evaluated through Ag - Ab docking (ZDOCK, ClusPro, and Rosetta server), binding free-energy calculations using Molecular Mechanics/Poisson Boltzman Surface Area (MM/PBSA) method, and interaction energy estimation. In comparison to olokizumab, eight newly designed theoretical antibodies demonstrated better result in all assessments. Therefore, these newly designed macromolecules were proposed as potential lead antibodies to serve as a therapeutics option for IL-6-mediated diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9601030>Kinetic analyses of mutations in the glycine-rich loop of cAMP-dependent protein kinase.</a></h2><p>The conserved glycines in the glycine-rich loop (Leu-Gly50--Gly52-Ser--Gly55-Arg-Val) of the catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase were each mutated to Ser (G50S, G52S, and G55S). The effects of these mutations were assessed here using both steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic methods. While G50S and G52S reduced the apparent affinity for ATP by approximately 10-fold, substitution at Gly55 had no effect on nucleotide binding. In contrast to ATP, only mutation at position 50 interfered with ADP binding. These three mutations lowered the rate of phosphoryl transfer by 7-300-fold. The combined data indicate that G50 and G52 are the most critical residues in the loop for catalysis, with replacement at position 52 being the most extreme owing to a larger decrease in the rate of phosphoryl transfer (29 vs 1.6 s-1 in contrast to 500 s-1 for wild-type C). Surprisingly, all three mutations lowered the affinity for Kemptide by approximately 10-fold, although none of the loop glycines makes direct contact with the substrate. The inability to correlate the rate constant for net product release with the dissociation constant for ADP implies that other steps may limit the decomposition of the ternary product complex. The observations that G52S (a) selectively affects ATP binding and (b) significantly lowers the rate of phosphoryl transfer without making direct contact with either the nucleotide or the peptide imply that this residue serves a structural role in the loop, most likely by positioning the backbone amide of Ser53 for contacting the gamma-phosphate of ATP. -minimized models of the mutant proteins are consistent with the observed kinetic consequences of each mutation. The models predict that only mutation of Gly52 will interfere with the observed hydrogen bonding between the backbone and ATP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22943296>Agonistic effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and its metabolites on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) through molecular docking simulation.</a></h2><p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a potent neurotrophic factor that is implicated in the regulation of food intake and body weight. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) localised in cell membranes have been shown to alter the levels of BDNF in the brain, suggesting that PUFAs and BDNF could have physical interaction with each other. To decipher the molecular mechanism through which PUFAs modulates BDNF's activity, molecular docking was performed for BDNF with PUFAs and its metabolites, with 4-Methyl Catechol as a control.Inferring from molecular docking studies, lipoxin A4 (LXA4), and a known anti-inflammatory bioactive metabolite derived from PUFAs, with a binding  of -3.98 Kcal/mol and dissociation constant of 1.2 mM showed highest binding affinity for BDNF in comparison to other PUFAs and metabolites considered in the study. Further, the residues Lys 18,  20, Ala 21, Val 22,  46, Glu 48, Lys 50, Lys 58,  75, Gln 77, Arg 97 and Ile 98 form hot point motif, which on interaction enhances BDNF's function.These results suggest that PUFAs and their metabolites especially, LXA4, modulate insulin resistance by establishing a physical interaction with BDNF. Similar interaction(s) was noted between BDNF and resolvins and protectins but were of lesser intensity compared to LXA4.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1514700>Application of a fluorogenic substrate in the assay of proteolytic activity and in the discovery of a potent inhibitor of Candida albicans aspartic proteinase.</a></h2><p>A fluorescent method for monitoring the activity of the secreted Candida carboxyl (aspartic) proteinase (EC 3.4.23.6) was developed using a fluorogenic substrate based on resonance  transfer. The fluorescent assay was used to monitor proteinase production, purification, and inhibition. The Km for the fluorogenic substrate, 4-(4-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoyl-gamma-aminobutyryl-Ile-His-Pro - -His-Leu-Val-Ile-His-- [5-(2-aminoethyl)amino]naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid, was found to be 4.3 microM at the optimum pH of 4.5. Reaction products were separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and identified by amino acid analysis or by 252Cf plasma desorption mass spectrometry. Cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate was between the histidine-threonine residues, releasing the fluorescent product, threonine-[5-(2-aminoethyl)amino]naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid. Proteolytic activity was expressed as nanomoles of fluorescent product released at 22 degrees C/60 min, pH 4.5, and the release of 0.9 nmol product was equivalent to one hemoglobin proteolytic unit (O.D.A700 increase of 0.100) produced at 37 degrees C/60 min, pH 3.5. The aspartic proteinase inhibitor pepstatin had an IC50 of 27 nM when tested in a dose-response study with the purified enzyme. The apparent Ki for pepstatis was 2.9 nM. Several synthetic inhibitors of the enzymes were identified with IC50's in the nanomolar range. The most potent compound, A70450, was characterized as a fast, tight-binding inhibitor having an IC50 of 1.3 nM and apparent Ki of 0.17 nM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23541889>Five functional adipokinetic peptides expressed in the corpus cardiacum of the moth genus Hippotion (Lepidoptera, Sphingidae).</a></h2><p>This is the first study that finds five adipokinetic hormones (AKHs) in the corpus cardiacum of an insect. From two species of the sphingid moth genus Hippotion, eson and celerio, three novel and two known AKHs were isolated and sequenced by deduction from multiple MS(n) electrospray mass data: two octapeptides are pGlu-Leu----Ser-Ser-Trp amide (denoted Hipes-AKH-I) and its (7) analogue (Hipes-AKH-II); two nonapeptides are pGlu-Leu----Ser-Ser-Trp-Gly amide (Manse-AKH) and its (7) analogue (Hipes-AKH-III), as well as a decapeptide pGlu-Leu---Ser-Ser-Gly-Trp-Gly-Gln amide (Manse-AKH-II). All sequences were confirmed by identical behaviour of natural and synthetic peptides in reversed-phase HPLC and liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray mass spectrometry, resulting in identical retention times and tandem mass spectral data. High resolution mass spectrometry and retention time data also confirmed that the amino acid at position 10 in Manse-AKH-II is Gln and not the isobaric Lys. Conspecific injections of all five peptides in synthetic form and low doses caused hyperlipaemia in H. eson. Our results and pertaining literature suggest that five genes code for the mature peptides, which are very likely released during flight to provide  for long distance migration in this genus via lipid oxidation; as all five peptides are active at low doses in a conspecific bioassay, it may be speculated, but not proven, that there is only one AKH receptor present in Hippotion that can bind all five peptides with high affinity.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.
