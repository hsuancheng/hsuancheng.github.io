It affects approximately 10% of the population globally with a greater prevalence at advanced ages. Airway bacterial infections complicate the disease course in most COPD patients, leading to increased symptoms, more rapid decline in lung function, acute exacerbations and reduced quality of life. With increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics and adverse effects of conventional treatments, new effective non-antibiotic antimicrobial therapies are urgently needed to manage COPD. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α is an important transcriptional regulator of cellular responses to hypoxia, oxidants and , and is overexpressed in the lungs of COPD patients. Recent evidence shows that increased HIF-1α expression can upregulate the platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) on the airway epithelial surface that is increased in smokers and particularly COPD patients. The receptor is utilized by PAFR-dependent bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) to induce infection in both the respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts. However, the importance and mechanism of HIF-1α in augmenting PAFR-dependent bacterial infections in COPD are poorly understood. Here, we review the evidence for the roles of local tissue hypoxia-induced , HIF-1α and PAFR in facilitating bacterial infections in COPD. Blocking PAFR may provide a novel antimicrobial approach to manage bacterial infections in COPD.© 2019 Asian Pacific Society of Respirology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665027>Flipping the dogma - phosphatidylserine in non-apoptotic cell death.</a></h2><p>The exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the outer plasma membrane has long been considered a unique feature of apoptotic cells. Together with other "eat me" signals, it enables the recognition and phagocytosis of dying cells (efferocytosis), helping to explain the immunologically-silent nature of apoptosis. Recently, however, PS exposure has also been reported in non-apoptotic forms of regulated inflammatory cell death, such as necroptosis, challenging previous dogma. In this review, we outline the evidence for PS exposure in non-apoptotic cells and extracellular vesicles (EVs), and discuss possible mechanisms based on our knowledge of apoptotic-PS exposure. In addition, we examine the outcomes of non-apoptotic PS exposure, including the reversibility of cell death, efferocytosis, and consequent . By examining PS biology, we challenge the established approach of distinguishing apoptosis from other cell death pathways by AnnexinV staining of PS externalization. Finally, we re-evaluate how PS exposure is thought to define apoptosis as an immunologically silent process distinct from other non-apoptotic and inflammatory cell death pathways. Ultimately, we suggest that a complete understanding of how regulated cell death processes affect the immune system is far from being fully elucidated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660822>Neutrophilic Asthma and Potentially Related Target Therapies.</a></h2><p>Neutrophilic asthma is generally associated with the absence of eosinophils and activation of non-predominant type 2 immunological pathways. It involves bronchial  followed by different degrees of airway remodeling. Environmental factors such as exhaust fumes, cigarette smoke, occupation-related agents, and infections have been associated with neutrophilic  which activates specific cellular and molecular pathways leading to neutrophilic .This review discusses the involvement of neutrophils in asthma and potentially related target therapies.Corticosteroid resistance is the hallmark of neutrophilic asthma which increases disease severity and leads to difficult-to-control asthma. Patients with neutrophil-dominant asthma are characterized by low levels of (or absence of) Th2 cytokines. Due to the shortage of effective treatments for neutrophilic asthma newer biologics are being developed that target type 2 asthma symptoms and phenotypes. Understanding different biomarkers, inflammatory pathways and treatment strategies involved in neutrophilic asthma will help decrease adverse effects related to corticosteroid insensitivity. A better understanding of neutrophilic  targets can lead to improved therapies.Further evaluation and clinical trials of emerging biologics need to be performed before bringing them into clinical practice.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660995>Complexity in unclassified auto-inflammatory disease: a case report illustrating the potential for disease arising from the allelic burden of multiple variants.</a></h2><p>Despite recent advances in the diagnosis and understanding of many autoinflammatory diseases, there are still a great number of patients with phenotypes that do not fit any clinically- and/or genetically-defined disorders.We describe a fourteen-year-old boy who presented at two and a half years of age with recurrent febrile episodes. Over the course of the disease, the episodes increased in frequency and severity, with new signs and symptoms continuing to appear. Most importantly, these included skin changes, splenomegaly and transaminitis. Only partial control of the disease was achieved with anti-IL-1 therapy. Extensive investigation showed generalized  without immune deficiency, with increased levels of serum amyloid A and several pro-inflammatory cytokines including interferon-γ, as well as an increased type I interferon score. Exome sequence analysis identified P369S and R408Q variants in the MEFV innate immunity regulator, pyrin (MEFV) gene and T260 M and T320 M variants in the NLR family pyrin domain containing 12 (NLRP12) gene.Patients with unclassified and/or unexplained autoinflammatory syndromes present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges and collectively form a substantial part of every cohort of patients with autoinflammatory diseases. Therefore, it is important to acquire their full genomic profile through whole exome and/or genome sequencing and present their cases to a broader audience, to facilitate characterization of similar patients.

This was followed by major advances in passive immunotherapy 75 years ago (production of pooled human IgG for subcutaneous injection) and 50 years ago (widespread technology for producing immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous administration). More than 200 tons of pooled human IgG are produced per year worldwide. The preparation is used primarily for IgG substitution in patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, as well as for an immunomodulating treatment of a growing number of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. These preparations contain the pooled IgG antibody repertoire of a large population of healthy plasma donors. This repertoire includes antibodies that neutralize pathogens and their factors of virulence, anti-idiotypic antibodies, and antibodies to other foreign and own proteins, as well as to carbohydrate antigens. Naturally polyspecific antibodies that are present in all healthy individuals play an important role as a first-line defense against bacteria and viruses. After exposure to protein-modifying agents, some IgG molecules can acquire the ability to bind novel structurally unrelated antigens. This phenomenon is referred to as induced polyspecificity. The list of these protein-modifying molecules was shown to include low-pH buffers, free heme, pro-oxidative ferrous ions, reactive oxygen species, etc. Such modified antibody preparations may have a therapeutic potential, since their administration to animals with experimental sepsis or aseptic systemic response syndromes significantly improved survival rates, while the same dose of the native preparation had no effect. We also hypothesize that the aggressive protein-modifying molecules released in sites of  and tissue damage could also modify the antigen-binding behavior of surface immunoglobulin B cell receptors and the structurally related T cell receptors. This "specificity editing" of both types of receptors may play a major role in the body's defense mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661651>Comparison of Chemokine CXCL-1 and Interleukin-6 Concentrations in the Subretinal Fluid and Vitreous in Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment.</a></h2><p>: Comparison of IL-6 and CXCL-1 concentrations and CXCL-1/IL-6 ratio correlations with clinical parameters (RRD extent, duration, and proliferative vitreoretinopathy - PVR-grade) between subretinal fluid (SRF) and vitreous during rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) complicated with PVR.: A total of 71 eyes of 71 patients with primary RRD possibly complicated with PVR were included; 36 eyes treated with scleral buckling and 35 eyes with pars-plana vitrectomy.

For instance, at the cellular level, the viscosity of subcellular organelles (mitochondria, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, nucleus, etc.) is much greater than that of cytoplasm; at the organismal level, compared with normal states of health, blood or lymphatic fluid viscosity will increase to some extent in diabetes, hypertension, , tumors and so on. However, due to the design shortcoming, there is a lack of efficient tool for detecting biomolecules in viscous living systems. Herein, we propose a rational design strategy for constructing ratiometric fluorescent probes with superior response signal-to-background (S/B) ratio in viscous systems based on rigid-fluorophore-molecular rotor platform, and a practical sulfur dioxide (SO2) probe (RFC-MRC) based on conmarin-cyanine dyad was prepared as a proof-of-concept. The probe performs a significant enhancement (71.5-fold) of ratiometric response signal stimulated by SO2 in viscous aqueous media. The cationic probe can selectively in mitochondria and was successfully utilized to sense SO2 in living HeLa cells through ratiometric fluorescence imaging. What's more, in the fluorescence imaging experiments of monitoring SO2 in apoptotic cells using probe RFC-MRC, a more obvious superior of S/B ratio was observed in the early apoptotic cells than in the lately apoptotic cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665386>Inflammatory profile dysregulation in nuclear workers occupationally exposed to low-dose gamma radiation.</a></h2><p>Chronic  is a common denominator linking a wide range of health conditions, including tissue response to radiation exposure. This pilot study investigates whether inflammatory cytokines-interleukins IL-6, -8, -10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-can be used as early biomarkers of radiation-induced adverse health effects in occupationally exposed individuals. The study included 33 workers externally exposed to gamma radiation from the nuclear industry with cumulated doses from 0.11 to 190 mSv and 42 non-exposed controls of comparable age and socio-economic status. IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, TNFα and IL-10 were analyzed by enzyme-linked assay (ELISA) in blood plasma samples. Total antioxidant status (TAS) of blood plasma was determined by a colorimetric assay. The radiation-exposed and control groups measured significantly different levels of MCP-1, TNFα and IL-10. Seventy-five percent of radiation workers had either high MCP-1 levels or low IL-10 levels and 30% had all three cytokines dysregulated. Approximately 50% of workers showed upregulated antioxidant status, which appeared to compensate the pro-inflammatory cytokine shift in these individuals. In contrast, only 2% of the control subjects were found to have three dysregulated cytokines, and all of them measured within the normal TAS range. The present study may represent an important step towards the establishment of a reliable set of biomarkers for health-risk estimation in population cohorts exposed to low radiation doses.© The Author(s) 2019.

Here, we evaluated target-specific fluorescence-mediated tomography (FMT) for visualization of neutrophil infiltration in murine experimental DSS-induced colitis. Colitis was assessed using clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological parameters. Intestinal neutrophil infiltration was determined at day 0, 4, and 10 by targeted FMT after injection of a neutrophil-specific fluorescence-labelled monoclonal antibody (Gr-1). Complementary, immunofluorescence tissue sections with Gr-1 and ELISA-based assessment of tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) served as the gold standard for the quantification of neutrophil infiltration. Colitic animals showed decreasing body weight, presence of fecal occult blood, and endoscopic signs of . FMT revealed a significantly increased level of fluorescence only four days after colitis induction as compared to pre-experimental conditions (pmol tracer 73.2 ± 18.1 versus 738.6 ± 80.7;  < 0.05), while neither body weight nor endoscopic assessment showed significant changes at this early time. Confirmatory, post-mortem immunofluorescence studies and measurements of tissue MPO confirmed the presence of increased neutrophil infiltration in colitic mice compared to controls. Concluding, Gr-1 targeted FMT can detect early colonic infiltration of neutrophils in experimental colitis even before clinical symptoms or endoscopic alterations occur. Therefore, FMT might be an important tool for repetitive and non-invasive monitoring of inflammatory cell infiltrate in intestinal .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659697>Dissecting the target leukocyte subpopulations of clinically relevant  radiopharmaceuticals.</a></h2><p>Leukocyte subtypes bear distinct pro-inflammatory, reparative, and regulatory functions. Imaging  provides information on disease prognosis and may guide therapy, but the cellular basis of the signal remains equivocal. We evaluated leukocyte subtype specificity of characterized clinically relevant -targeted radiotracers.Leukocyte populations were purified from blood- and THP-1-derived macrophages were polarized into M1-, reparative M2a-, or M2c-macrophages. In vitro uptake assays were conducted using tracers of enhanced glucose or amino acid metabolism and molecular markers of inflammatory cells. Both F-deoxyglucose (F-FDG) and the labeled amino acid C-methionine (C-MET) displayed higher uptake in neutrophils and monocytes compared to other leukocytes (P = 0.005), and markedly higher accumulation in pro-inflammatory M1-macrophages compared to reparative M2a-macrophages (P < 0.001). Molecular tracers Ga-DOTATATE targeting the somatostatin receptor type 2 and Ga-pentixafor targeting the chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) exhibited broad uptake by leukocyte subpopulations and polarized macrophages with highest uptake in T-cells/natural killer cells and B-cells compared to neutrophils. Mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO)-targeted F-flutriciclamide selectively accumulated in monocytes and pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages (P < 0.001). Uptake by myocytes and fibroblasts tended to be higher for metabolic radiotracers.The different in vitro cellular uptake profiles may allow isolation of distinct phases of the inflammatory pathway with specific -targeted radiotracers.

These deficits are long-lasting and no treatment options are available. A better understanding of the mechanistic basis for these cognitive deficits is needed to develop novel treatments. Intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels are decreased in ABI. Herein, we focus on augmentation of cAMP by PDE4 inhibitors and the potentially synergistic mechanisms in traumatic brain injury. A major acute pathophysiological event in ABI is the breakdown of the blood- brain-barrier (BBB). Intracellular cAMP pathways are involved in the subsequent emergence of edema,  and hyperexcitability. We propose that PDE4 inhibitors such as roflumilast can improve cognition by modulation of the activity in the cAMP-Phosphokinase A-Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (RAC1)  pathway. In addition, PDE4 inhibitors can also directly enhance network plasticity and attenuate degenerative processes and cognitive dysfunction by increasing activity of the canonical cAMP/phosphokinase-A/cAMP Responsive Element Binding protein (cAMP/PKA/CREB) plasticity pathway. Doublecourtin and microtubule-associated protein 2 are generated following activation of the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway and are decreased or even absent after injury. Both proteins are involved in neuronal plasticity and may consist of viable markers to track these processes. It is concluded that PDE4 inhibitors may consist of a novel class of drugs for the treatment of residual symptoms in ABI attenuating the pathophysiological consequences of a BBB breakdown by their anti- inflammatory actions via the cAMP/PKA/RAC1 pathway and by increasing synaptic plasticity via the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway. Roflumilast improves cognition in young and elderly humans and would be an excellent candidate for a proof of concept study in ABI patients.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663680>Bovine Milk Transcriptome Analysis Reveals microRNAs and RNU2 Involved in Mastitis.</a></h2><p>Mastitis is a common inflammatory infectious disease in dairy cows. To understand the microRNA (miRNA) expression profile changes during bovine mastitis, we undertook a genome-wide miRNA study of normal milk and milk that tested positive on the California mastitis test for bovine mastitis (CMT+). Twenty-five miRNAs were differentially expressed (23 miRNAs upregulated and two downregulated) during bovine mastitis relative to their expression in normal milk. Upregulated mature miR-1246 probably derived from a U2 small nuclear RNA rather than an miR-1246 precursor. The significantly upregulated miRNA precursors and RNU2 were significantly enriched on bovine chromosome 19, which is homologous to human chromosome 17. A gene ontology analysis of the putative mRNA targets of the significantly upregulated miRNAs showed that these miRNAs were involved in binding target mRNA transcripts and regulating target gene expression, and a KEGG pathway analysis showed that the upregulated miRNAs were predominantly related to cancer and immune system pathways. Three novel miRNAs were associated with bovine mastitis and were relatively highly expressed in milk. We confirmed that one of the novel mastitis-related miRNAs was significantly upregulated using a digital PCR system. The differentially expressed miRNAs were involved in human cancers, infections, and immune-related diseases.

Although many studies have reported that FM regulates intracellular calcium signaling, research on the exact type of calcium channel modulated by FM is scarce.

FM (0.03 mg/mL) and its fractions, especially hexane fraction (FM, 0.01 mg/mL), significantly inhibited SOCE and IL-2 cytokine production in Jurkat T lymphocytes. GC/MS analysis showed linoleic acid (LA) as the major component of FM. FM at 0.01 mg/mL (equivalent to 10 M LA) inhibited not only SOCE but also IL-2 production, as well as CD3/CD28 receptor co-stimulation induced calcium signaling in Jurkat T lymphocytes.

They are often characterized by marked genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity, complicating diagnostic work in clinical practice and molecular diagnosis.To develop and evaluate a next-generation sequencing panel targeting genes causing neuroinflammation or mimicking neuroinflammation.Cohort study in which a total of 257 genes associated with monogenic neuroinflammation and/or cerebral vasculopathy, including monogenic noninflammatory diseases mimicking these entities, were selected. A customized enrichment capture array, the neuroinflammation gene panel (NIP), was created. Targeted high-coverage sequencing was applied to DNA samples taken from eligible patients referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, United Kingdom, between January 1, 2017, and January 30, 2019, because of onset of disease early in life, family history, and/or complex neuroinflammatory phenotypes.The main outcome was the percentage of individuals with definitive molecular diagnoses, variant classification, and clinical phenotyping of patients with pathogenic variants identified using the NIP panel. The NIP panel was initially validated in 16 patients with known genetic diagnoses.The NIP was both sensitive (95%) and specific (100%) for detection of known mutations, including gene deletions, copy number variants, small insertions and deletions, and somatic mosaicism with allele fraction as low as 3%. Prospective testing of 60 patients (30 [50%] male; median [range] age, 9.8 [0.8-20] years) presenting with heterogeneous neuroinflammatory phenotypes revealed at least 1 class 5 (clearly pathogenic) variant in 9 of 60 patients (15%); 18 of 60 patients (30%) had at least 1 class 4 (likely pathogenic) variant.

We employed RNA sequencing and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to profile gene expression in blood and the composition of the fecal microbiota in infants born at <29 weeks gestational age and diagnosed with BPD in comparison to those of preterm infants that were not diagnosed with BPD. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, performed longitudinally on 255 fecal samples collected from 50 infants in the first months of life, identified significant differences in the relative levels of abundance of , and  in the BPD infants in a manner that was birth mode dependent. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis revealed that more than 400 genes were upregulated in infants with BPD. Genes upregulated in BPD infants were significantly enriched for functions related to red blood cell development and oxygen transport, while several immune-related pathways were downregulated. We also identified a gene expression signature consistent with an enrichment of immunosuppressive CD71 early erythroid cells in infants with BPD. Intriguingly, genes that were correlated in their expression with the relative abundances of specific taxa in the microbiota were significantly enriched for roles in the immune system, suggesting that changes in the microbiota might influence immune gene expression systemically. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious inflammatory condition of the lung and is the most common complication associated with preterm birth. A large body of evidence now suggests that the gut microbiota can influence immunity and  systemically; however, the role of the gut microbiota in BPD has not been evaluated to date. Here, we report that there are significant differences in the gut microbiota of infants born at <29 weeks gestation and subsequently diagnosed with BPD, which are particularly pronounced when infants are stratified by birth mode. We also show that erythroid and immune gene expression levels are significantly altered in BPD infants. Interestingly, we identified an association between the composition of the microbiota and immune gene expression in blood in early life. Together, these findings suggest that the composition of the microbiota may influence the risk of developing BPD and, more generally, may shape systemic immune gene expression.Copyright © 2019 Ryan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661121>Dihydroartemisinin attenuates lipopolysaccharide‑induced acute lung injury in mice by suppressing NF‑κB signaling in an Nrf2‑dependent manner.</a></h2><p>Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe health issue with significant morbidity and mortality. Artemisinin is used for the treatment of fever and malaria in clinical practice. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), the major active metabolite of artemisinin, plays a role in anti‑organizational fibrosis and anti‑neuronal cell death. However, whether DHA can attenuate ALI remains unclear. The current study thus examined the effects of DHA on ALI and primary macrophages. The results revealed that DHA attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‑induced pulmonary pathological damage. DHA suppressed the LPS‑induced infiltration of inflammatory cells, the elevation of myeloperoxidase activity, oxidative stress and the production of pro‑inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)‑1β, tumor necrosis factor‑α, and IL‑6. Furthermore, DHA reduced the LPS‑induced inflammatory response by suppressing the degradation of I‑κB and the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor κ‑light‑chain‑enhancer of activated B cells (NF‑κB)/p65 in vivo and in vitro. DHA activated the nuclear factor‑erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, which was suppressed by LPS treatment. The Nrf2 inhibitor, ML385, diminished the protective effects of DHA against LPS‑induced  in macrophages. On the whole, the findings of this study demonstrate that DHA exerts therapeutic effects against LPS‑induced ALI by inhibiting the Nrf2‑mediated NF‑κB activation in macrophages. The present study also confirmed the therapeutic effects of DHA in mice with LPS‑induced ALI. Thus, these findings demonstrate that DHA exhibits anti‑inflammatory activities and may be a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of ALI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660940>Anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activities of the extracts, fractions, and chemical constituents isolated from Luehea ochrophylla Mart.</a></h2><p>Stem bark of Luehea ochrophylla (L. ochrophylla) is used by the traditional Brazilian medicine for treatment of rheumatic diseases and tumors. This study aimed to investigate inhibition of acute and chronic inflammations and cytotoxic activity of extracts, fractions, and isolated compounds from L. ochrophylla.Hexane (HE) and ethanol (EE) extracts obtained from stem bark of L. ochrophylla were submitted to chromatographic fractionation. In order to test acute , experimental model of impact injury was used, followed by transdermal application of gels using phonophoresis. Histological analysis was based on scores assigned by the capacity of decreasing the lesion. To evaluate the effect EE and fractions on cell proliferation, human lymphocytes were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and analyzed using flow cytometry. Proliferation was measured using VPD 450 staining and the calculated proliferative index (PI). The cytotoxic activity was evaluated using MTT colorimetric method against MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, HCT-116, and Vero cells. GraphPad Prism Version 5 was used for statistical analysis.HE and EE provided friedelin, β-friedelinol, lupeol, mixture of lupeol and pseudotaraxasterol, β-sitosterol, betulinic acid, mixture of lupeol and taraxasterol, (-)-epicatechin, β-sitosterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, and (+)-epicatechin-(4β-8)-epicatechin. HE, ethyl acetate fraction (AF), betulinic acid, and β-sitosterol promoted regeneration of muscle fibers caused by muscle injury. AF significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the lymphocyte proliferation index (1.36 for cultures stimulated with PHA, 0.7 for untreated cultures and 0.12 for cultures stimulated with PHA and treated with AF 25 μg/mL and AF 50 μg/mL, respectively). β-Sitosterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside exhibited high cytotoxic activity (IC = 1.279 μg/mL) against HCT-116 cell line.These results suggest that extracts, fractions, and chemical constituents from L. ochrophylla decreases inflammatory processes generated by muscle injury. The anti-inflammatory activity may be justified by high inhibition of T cell proliferation. These extracts, fractions, and chemical constituents from L. ochrophylla may be useful as a therapeutic agent against rheumatic diseases. Moreover, chemical constituents from L. ochrophylla show potent cytotoxic activity against colon and rectal carcinomas.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663508>Transient protein accumulation at the center of the T cell antigen-presenting cell interface drives efficient IL-2 secretion.</a></h2><p>Supramolecular signaling assemblies are of interest for their unique signaling properties. A µm scale signaling assembly, the central supramolecular signaling cluster (cSMAC), forms at the center of the interface of T cells activated by antigen-presenting cells. We have determined that it is composed of multiple complexes of a supramolecular volume of up to 0.5 µm and associated with extensive membrane undulations. To determine cSMAC function, we have systematically manipulated the localization of three adaptor proteins, LAT, SLP-76, and Grb2. cSMAC localization varied between the adaptors and was diminished upon blockade of the costimulatory receptor CD28 and deficiency of the signal amplifying kinase Itk. Reconstitution of cSMAC localization restored IL-2 secretion which is a key T cell effector function as dependent on reconstitution dynamics. Our data suggest that the cSMAC enhances early signaling by facilitating signaling interactions and attenuates signaling thereafter through sequestration of a more limited set of signaling intermediates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661479>[Mouse Models of Sepsis and Septic Shock].</a></h2><p>An extensive network of regulation of systemic  makes development of a reproducible experimental model of sepsis a complex task.

Risk factors for mortality were assessed by logistic regression analysis.The cohort included 2621 patients. Setting of infection acquisition was community-acquired in 31.6%, early onset hospital-acquired in 25%, and late-onset hospital-acquired in 43.4% of patients. Overall prevalence of antimicrobial resistance was 26.3% and difficult-to-treat resistant Gram-negative bacteria 4.3%, with great variation according to geographic region. No difference in prevalence of antimicrobial resistance was observed according to setting of infection acquisition. Overall mortality was 29.1%. Independent risk factors for mortality included late-onset hospital-acquired infection, diffuse peritonitis, sepsis, septic shock, older age, malnutrition, liver failure, congestive heart failure, antimicrobial resistance (either methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacteria, or carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria) and source control failure evidenced by either the need for surgical revision or persistent .This multinational, heterogeneous cohort of ICU patients with intra-abdominal infection revealed that setting of infection acquisition, anatomical disruption, and severity of disease expression are disease-specific phenotypic characteristics associated with outcome, irrespective of the type of infection. Antimicrobial resistance is equally common in community-acquired as in hospital-acquired infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660029>Role of tristetraprolin phosphorylation in paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Intestinal  and epithelial injury are the leading actors of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), causing an excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines expression. Tristetraprolin (TTP), an mRNA binding protein, plays a role in regulating the inflammatory factors, recognizing specific sequences on the 3' untranslated region of cytokine mRNAs. TTP activity depends on its phosphorylation state: the unphosphorylated TTP degrades pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNAs; on the contrary, the phosphorylated TTP fails to destabilize mRNAs furthering their expression. The phospho-TTP forms a complex with the chaperone protein 14-3-3. This binding could be one of the factors that promote intestinal  as a cause of disease progression.To assess if TTP phosphorylation has a role in paediatric IBD.The study was carried out on a cohort of paediatric IBD patients. For each patient enrolled, a specimen of inflamed and non-inflamed colonic mucosa was collected. Furthermore, the experiments were conducted on macrophages differentiated from blood samples of the same patients. Macrophages from healthy donors' blood were used as controls. Co-immunoprecipitation assay and immunoblotting analyses were performed to observe the formation of the phospho-TTP/14-3-3 complex. In the same samples TNF-α expression was also evaluated as major factor of the pro-inflammatory activity.In this work we studied indirectly the phosphorylation of TTP through the binding with the chaperone protein 14-3-3. In inflamed and non-inflamed colon mucosa of IBD paediatric patients immunoblot assay demonstrated a higher expression of the TTP in inflamed samples respect to the non-inflamed; the co-immunoprecipitated 14-3-3 protein showed the same trend of expression. In the  gene expression analysis higher levels of the cytokine in inflamed tissues compared to controls were evident. The same experiments were conducted on macrophages from IBD paediatric patients and healthy controls. The immunoblot results demonstrated a high expression of both TTP and co-immunoprecipitated 14-4-3 protein in IBD-derived macrophages in comparison to healthy donors. TNF-α protein levels from macrophages lysates showed the same trend of expression in favour of IBD paediatric patients compared to healthy controls.In this work, for the first time, we describe a relation between phospho-TTP/14-3-3 complex and IBD. Indeed, a higher expression of TTP/14-3-3 was recorded in IBD samples in comparison to controls.©The Author(s) 2019. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

SCGN interacts with the SNARE complex, which is required for vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We show that the  mutation identified impacted the localization of the SNARE complex partner, SNAP25, leading to impaired hormone release. Finally, we show that mouse models of  deficiency recapitulate impaired hormone release and susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis. Altogether, these studies demonstrate that functional deficiency in SCGN can result in intestinal  and implicates the neuroendocrine cellular compartment in IBD.© 2019, Sifuentes-Dominguez et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661509>APOL1-G0 protects podocytes in a mouse model of HIV-associated nephropathy.</a></h2><p>African polymorphisms in the gene for Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) confer a survival advantage against lethal trypanosomiasis but also an increased risk for several chronic kidney diseases (CKD) including HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). APOL1 is expressed in renal cells, however, the pathogenic events that lead to renal cell damage and kidney disease are not fully understood. The podocyte function of APOL1-G0 versus APOL1-G2 in the setting of a known disease stressor was assessed using transgenic mouse models. Transgene expression, survival, renal pathology and function, and podocyte density were assessed in an intercross of a mouse model of HIVAN (Tg26) with two mouse models that express either APOL1-G0 or APOL1-G2 in podocytes. Mice that expressed HIV genes developed heavy proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis, and had significant losses in podocyte numbers and reductions in podocyte densities. Mice that co-expressed APOL1-G0 and HIV had preserved podocyte numbers and densities, with fewer morphologic manifestations typical of HIVAN pathology. Podocyte losses and pathology in mice co-expressing APOL1-G2 and HIV were not significantly different from mice expressing only HIV. Podocyte hypertrophy, a known compensatory event to stress, was increased in the mice co-expressing HIV and APOL1-G0, but absent in the mice co-expressing HIV and APOL1-G2. Mortality and renal function tests were not significantly different between groups. APOL1-G0 expressed in podocytes may have a protective function against podocyte loss or injury when exposed to an environmental stressor. This was absent with APOL1-G2 expression, suggesting APOL1-G2 may have lost this protective function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662982>Chlorogenic Acid Attenuates Kidney Ischemic/Reperfusion Injury via Reducing , Tubular Injury, and Myofibroblast Formation.</a></h2><p>Kidney ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury is the main cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) involving renal function deterioration, renal architecture damage, and . This condition may lead to kidney fibrosis with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and myofibroblast formation. Inhibition of chronic effects of kidney I/R injury may provide effective strategies for treating AKI and chronic kidney diseases (CKDs). Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is recognized as a powerful antioxidant, with anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties in many conditions. However, the effect of CGA on kidney I/R injury has not been elucidated yet. Kidney I/R injury was performed on male Swiss background mice (I/R group,  = 5, 3-4 months, 30-40 g) which underwent bilateral renal pedicles clamping for 30 minutes and then were euthanized on day three after operation. Three groups of I/R were treated with 3 different doses of CGA intraperitoneally for 2 days: 3.5 (I/R + CGA1 group), 7 (I/R + CGA2 group), and 14 (I/R + CGA3 group) mg/kg of body weight. Tubular injury was quantified based on Periodic Acid-Schiff staining, while reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to quantify mRNA expression of TGF-1, vimentin, SOD-1, TLR-4, TNF-α, NF-κB and MCP-1. Immunohistochemical staining was done to quantify proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), myofibroblast (-SMA), SOD-1 and macrophage (CD68) number. Kidney I/R demonstrated tubular injury and increased inflammatory mediator expression, macrophage number, and myofibroblast expansion. Meanwhile, histological analysis showed lower tubular injury with higher epithelial cell proliferation in CGA-treated groups compared to the I/R group. RT-PCR also revealed significantly lower TGF-1 and vimentin mRNA expressions with higher SOD-1 mRNA expression. CGA-treated groups also demonstrated a significantly lower macrophage and myofibroblast number compared to the I/R group. These findings associated with lower mRNA expression of TLR-4, TNF-α, NF-κB, and MCP-1 as inflammatory mediators in CGA groups. I/R + CGA3 represented the highest amelioration effect among other CGA-treated groups. CGA treatment attenuates kidney I/R injury through reducing , decreasing myofibroblast expansion, and inducing epithelial cells proliferation.Copyright © 2019 Nur Arfian et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661469>Neutrophil-targeted, protease-activated pulmonary drug delivery blocks airway and systemic .</a></h2><p>Pulmonary drug delivery presents a unique opportunity to target lower airway , which is often characterized by the massive recruitment of neutrophils from blood. However specific therapies are lacking that can modulate airway neutrophil function, and difficult challenges must be overcome to achieve therapeutic efficacy against pulmonary , notably drug hydrophobicity, mucociliary and macrophage-dependent clearance, and high extracellular protease burden. Here, we present a multi-stage, aerodynamically favorable delivery platform that uses extracellular proteolysis to its advantage in order to deliver nanoparticle-embedded hydrophobic drugs to neutrophils within the lower airways. Our design consists in a self-regulated nanoparticle-in-microgel system, in which microgel activation is triggered by extracellular elastase (degranulated by inflammatory neutrophils), and nanoparticles are loaded with Nexinhib20, a potent neutrophil degranulation inhibitor. Successful in vivo delivery of Nexinhib20 to the airways and into neutrophils promoted resolution of the inflammatory response by dampening neutrophil recruitment and degranulation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production in both airway and systemic compartments, as well as the presence of neutrophil-derived pathological extracellular vesicles in the lung fluid. Our findings showcase a new platform that overcomes challenges in pulmonary drug delivery and allows customization to match the proteolytic footprint of given diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665196>Retraction: Butyrate Attenuates Lipopolysaccharide-Induced  in Intestinal Cells and Crohn's Mucosa through Modulation of Antioxidant Defense Machinery.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659451>Anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047 on high-fat and high-fructose diet mice base on inflammatory response alleviation and gut microbiota regulation.</a></h2><p>The objective of the study was to evaluate the anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047, and illustrate the potential functional mechanism about the alleviation of high fat and high fructose diet (HFFD) induced obesity and related metabolic abnormalities.C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a standard or HFFD with or without supplementation of L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 for 10 weeks. Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658997> triggers liver X receptor-dependent lipogenesis.</a></h2><p>Immune cell function can be modulated by changes in lipid metabolism.

The -dependent increase in lipogenesis requires induction of the liver X receptors, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors, by type I interferons in response to inflammatory signals. Instead of the well-established role for liver X receptors in stimulating cholesterol efflux, we demonstrate that liver X receptors are necessary for the proper resumption of cholesterol synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Thus, liver X receptors function as bidirectional regulators of cholesterol homeostasis driving efflux when cholesterol levels are high and facilitating synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Liver X receptor activity is also required for the proper shutdown of a subset of type I interferon-stimulated genes as  subsides, placing the receptors in a negative feedback loop that may contribute to resolution of the inflammatory response.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658773>Virus Adaptation and Selection Following Challenge of Animals Vaccinated against Classical Swine Fever Virus.</a></h2><p>Vaccines against classical swine fever have proven very effective in protecting pigs from this deadly disease. However, little is known about how vaccination impacts the selective pressures acting on the classical swine fever virus (CSFV). Here we use high-throughput sequencing of viral genomes to investigate evolutionary changes in virus populations following the challenge of naïve and vaccinated pigs with the highly virulent CSFV strain "Koslov". The challenge inoculum contained an ensemble of closely related viral sequences, with three major haplotypes being present, termed A, B, and C. After the challenge, the viral haplotype A was preferentially located within the tonsils of naïve animals but was highly prevalent in the sera of all vaccinated animals. We find that the viral population structure in naïve pigs after infection is very similar to that in the original inoculum. In contrast, the viral population in vaccinated pigs, which only underwent transient low-level viremia, displayed several distinct changes including the emergence of 16 unique non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were not detectable in the challenge inoculum. Further analysis showed a significant loss of heterogeneity and an increasing positive selection acting on the virus populations in the vaccinated pigs. We conclude that vaccination imposes a strong selective pressure on viruses that subsequently replicate within the vaccinated animal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665815>Semen exosomes inhibit HIV infection and HIV-induced proinflammatory cytokine production independently of the activation state of primary lymphocytes.</a></h2><p>Semen exosomes (SE) inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

Nutritional status has a clear relationship with disease outcomes, and malnutrition in CF is typically a result of chronic negative energy balance secondary to malabsorption. As the mechanisms underlying the pathology of CF and its implications on nutrient absorption and energy expenditure have been elucidated, nutrition support has become increasingly sophisticated. Comprehensive nutrition monitoring and treatment guidelines from professional and advocacy organizations have unified the approach to nutrition optimization around the world. Newborn screening allows for early nutrition intervention and improvement in short- and long-term growth and other clinical outcomes. The nutrition support goal in CF care includes achieving optimal nutritional status to support growth and pubertal development in children, maintenance of optimal nutritional status in adult life, and optimizing fat soluble vitamin and essential fatty acid status. The mainstay of this approach is a high calorie, high-fat diet, exceeding age, and sex energy intake recommendations for healthy individuals. For patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, enzyme replacement therapy is required to improve fat and calorie absorption. Enzyme dosing varies by age and dietary fat intake. Multiple potential impediments to absorption, including decreased motility, altered gut luminal bile salt and microbiota composition, and enteric  must be considered. Fat soluble vitamin supplementation is required in patients with pancreatic insufficiency.

It is generally accepted that cutaneous wound healing can be divided into 4 phases: haemostasis, , proliferation, and remodelling. In humans, keratinocytes re-form a functional epidermis (reepithelialization) as rapidly as possible, closing the wound and reestablishing tissue homeostasis. Dermal fibroblasts migrate into the wound bed and proliferate, creating "granulation tissue" rich in extracellular matrix proteins and supporting the growth of new blood vessels. Ultimately, this is remodelled over an extended period, returning the injured tissue to a state similar to that before injury. Dysregulation in any phase of the wound healing cascade delays healing and may result in various skin pathologies, including nonhealing, or chronic ulceration. Indigenous and traditional medicines make extensive use of natural products and derivatives of natural products and provide more than half of all medicines consumed today throughout the world. Recognising the important role traditional medicine continues to play, we have undertaken an extensive survey of literature reporting the use of medical plants and plant-based products for cutaneous wounds. We describe the active ingredients, bioactivities, clinical uses, formulations, methods of preparation, and clinical value of 36 medical plant species. Several species stand out, including ,  and , which are popular wound healing products used by several cultures and ethnic groups. The popularity and evidence of continued use clearly indicates that there are still lessons to be learned from traditional practices.

We hypothesized that the inflammasome activity may be a central pathway by which HO-1 controls pulmonary  following alveolar hypoxia. Therefore, we investigated whether HO-1 controls inflammasome activation by altering its expression in macrophages primed with classical NLRP3 inducers, and in murine lungs lacking HO-1 and exposed to acute hypoxia. We found that lack of HO-1 activated LPS and ATP-treated bone marrow derived-macrophages (BMDMs) causing an increase in secreted levels of cleaved IL-1B, IL-18, and caspase-1, markers of increased inflammasome activity, whereas HO-1 overexpression suppressed IL-1B, NLRP3, and IL-18. The production of cleaved IL-1B and the activation of caspase-1 in LPS and ATP-primed macrophages were inhibited by hemin, and two of the HO-1 enzymatic products (bilirubin and carbon monoxide (CO)). Exposure of mice to hypoxia induced the expression of several inflammasome mRNA components (IL-1B, Nlrp3 and Caspase-1) and this was further augmented by HO-1 deficiency. This pronounced inflammasome activation was detected as increased protein levels of ASC, IL-18, pro-caspase-1, and cleaved caspase-1 in the lungs of hypoxic mice. Systemically, Hmox1 deficient mice showed increased basal levels of IL-18 that were further increased after 48 hours of hypoxic exposure. Taken together, these finding points to a pivotal role for HO-1 in the control of baseline and hypoxic inflammasome signaling, perhaps through the antioxidant properties of bilirubin and CO's pleiotropic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661911>The Sequence and a Three-Dimensional Structural Analysis Reveal Substrate Specificity Among Snake Venom Phosphodiesterases.</a></h2><p>(1) Background.

Until now, there have been no 3D structural studies of these enzymes, thereby preventing structure-function analysis. To enable such investigations, the present work describes the model-based structural and functional characterization of a phosphodiesterase from   venom, named PDE_ (2) Methods. The PDE_ structure model was produced and validated using various software (model building: I-TESSER, MODELLER 9v19, Swiss-Model, and validation tools: PROCHECK, ERRAT, Molecular Dynamic Simulation, and Verif3D). (3) Results. The proposed model of the enzyme indicates that the 3D structure of PDE_ comprises four domains, a somatomedin B domain, a somatomedin B-like domain, an ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase domain, and a DNA/RNA non-specific domain. Sequence and structural analyses suggest that differences in length and composition among homologous snake venom sequences may account for their differences in substrate specificity. Other properties that may influence substrate specificity are the average volume and depth of the active site cavity. (4) Conclusion. Sequence comparisons indicate that SVPDEs exhibit high sequence identity but comparatively low identity with mammalian and bacterial PDEs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663123>Interleukin-33 polymorphisms and serum concentrations in mycosis fungoides.</a></h2><p>Mycosis fungoides (MF) skin lesions are characterized by low-grade , which may be sustained by proinflammatory cytokines as probably interleukin-33 (IL-33). We compared serum concentrations of IL-33 and its receptor ST2 and the frequency of selected IL-33 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between patients with MF and healthy controls.In 88 patients with MF and 66 healthy controls, we analyzed SNPs in the 9894 and 11877 loci of the IL-33 gene. Moreover, we measured serum concentrations of IL-33 and its receptor ST2.There were no statistically significant differences in the frequencies of both IL-33 SNPs between patients and controls. Compared with controls, patients with MF had similar IL-33 serum concentrations (P = 0.71) but significantly increased ST2 concentrations (P < 0.001). Patients in MF-IA stage had significantly lower ST2 serum concentrations than those with the remaining MF stages (P = 0.002). The studied variables were not related to pruritus severity. Patients with the C(+) IL-33 11877 SNP had lower ST2 serum concentrations than patients with the C(-) 11877 SNP (P = 0.043).It was published before that the knockout of the ST2 gene after injection of IL-33 is associated with a reduced inflammatory reaction in the skin, as well as that IL-33 plays a role in allergic and neoplastic disorders. Concerning the difference in ST2 concentration between control and MF group, and C IL-33 11877 SNP possibly influencing the ST2 concentration, the role of IL-33/ST2 signaling, needs further studies.© 2019 The International Society of Dermatology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659095>Factors and measures predicting external CSF drain-associated ventriculitis: A review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>To determine the diagnostic value of clinical factors and biochemical or microbiological measures for diagnosing a drain-associated ventriculitis, we summarized the available evidence.We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of patients with external ventricular CSF drains who developed drain-associated ventriculitis by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL electronic database. We reported the occurrence of abnormal test results in patients with and without drain-associated ventriculitis. For continuous variables, we recalculated mean values presented in multiple studies.We identified 42 articles published between 1984 and 2018 including 3,035 patients with external CSF drains of whom 697 (23%) developed drain-associated bacterial ventriculitis. Indications for drain placement were subarachnoid, intraventricular or cerebral hemorrhage or hemorrhage not further specified (69%), traumatic brain injury (13%), and obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to a brain tumor (10%). Fever was present in 116 of 162 patients with ventriculitis (72%) compared with 80 of 275 (29%) patients without ventriculitis. The CSF cell count was increased for 74 of 80 patients (93%) with bacterial ventriculitis and 30 of 95 patients (32%) without ventriculitis. CSF culture was positive in 125 of 156 episodes classified as ventriculitis (80%), and CSF Gram stain was positive in 44 of 81 patients (54%). In patients with ventriculitis, PCR on ribosomal RNA was positive on 54 of 78 CSF samples (69%).Clinical factors and biochemical and microbiological measures have limited diagnostic value in differentiating between ventriculitis and sterile  in patients with external CSF drains.

Microcirculation injury during sepsis affects capillary permeability and leukocyte-endothelium interactions and is thought to be instrumental in organ injury. Several studies have demonstrated a beneficial effect of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) injection on survival and organ dysfunctions in sepsis models. MSCs' in vivo activity also appears to be very dependent on the information provided prior to injection. Indeed preconditioning by IFNγ (MSC-IFNγ) increases immunosuppressive capacity of MSCs in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the objective was to evaluate the effect of MSC naive or IFNγ-preconditioned on leukocyte-endothelium interactions in a polymicrobial sepsis model by intraperitoneal feces injection. Six hours (H6) after this induction, we used intravital microscopy in mice cremaster muscle venules to study the flow behavior of leukocytes. Plasmas were harvested to evaluate  level and endothelial activation. We showed that MSC-IFNγ have a beneficial effect on microcirculation, by increasing the flow of White Blood Cells (WBC) and the percentage of venules containing flowing WBC, by significantly reducing the adhesion of WBC and by increasing the average of red blood cell velocity (VRBC). In conclusion, our results suggest that intravenous injection of preconditioned MSC-IFNγ improves microvascular hemodynamics in early phases of sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662995>Establishment and Initial Testing of a Medium-Sized, Surgically Feasible Animal Model for Brucellar Spondylodiscitis: A Preliminary Study.</a></h2><p>Brucellar spondylodiscitis, the most prevalent and significant osteoarticular presentation of human Brucellosis, is difficult to diagnose and usually yields irreversible neurologic deficits and spinal deformities. However, no animal models of Brucellar spondylodiscitis exist, allowing for preclinical investigations. The present study investigated whether intraosseous injection of attenuated  vaccine into rabbits' lumbar vertebrae imitates the radiographic and histopathological characteristics of human Brucellar spondylodiscitis. Radiographic and histopathological analyses at 8 weeks postoperatively revealed radiographic changes within vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs, abscesses formation within the paravertebral soft tissue, and typical prominent  response without caseous necrosis, which were largely comparable to human Brucellar spondylodiscitis. Such a medium-sized, surgically feasible rabbit model provides a promising  setting for further preclinical investigation of Brucellar spondylodiscitis.Copyright © 2019 Xiaoyu Cai et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658406>N-terminal autoprocessing and acetylation of MARTX Makes-Caterpillars Floppy-like effector is stimulated by ADP-Ribosylation Factor 1 in advance of Golgi fragmentation.</a></h2><p>Studies have successfully elucidated the mechanism of action of several effector domains that comprise the MARTX toxins of Vibrio vulnificus. However, the biochemical linkage between the cysteine proteolytic activity of Makes Caterpillars Floppy-like (MCF) effector and its cellular effects remains unknown. In this study, we identify the host cell factors that activate in vivo and in vitro MCF autoprocessing as ADP-Ribosylation Factor 1 (ARF1) and ADP-ribosylation Factor 3 (ARF3). Autoprocessing activity is enhanced when ARF1 is in its active (GTP-bound) form compared to the inactive (GDP-bound) form. Subsequent to auto-cleavage, MCF is acetylated on its exposed N-terminal glycine residue. Acetylation apparently does not dictate subcellular localization, as MCF is found localized throughout the cell. However, the cleaved form of MCF gains the ability to bind to the specialized lipid phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate enriched in Golgi and other membranes necessary for endocytic trafficking, suggesting a fraction of MCF may be subcellular localized. Traditional thin-section electron microscopy, high-resolution cryoAPEX localization, and fluorescent microscopy show that MCF causes Golgi dispersal resulting in extensive vesiculation. In addition, host mitochondria are disrupted and fragmented. Mass spectrometry analysis found no reproducible modifications of ARF1 suggesting ARF1 is not post-translationally modified by MCF. Further, catalytically active MCF does not stably associate with ARF1. Our data indicate that ARF1 is a cross-kingdom activator of MCF, but also that MCF may mediate cytotoxicity by directly targeting another yet to be identified protein. This study begins to elucidate the biochemical activity of this important domain and gives insight into how it may promote disease progression.This article is protected by copyright.

GT in primary‑cultured chondrocytes enhances expression of type II collagen, an indicator of differentiation, and cyclooxygenase‑2 (COX‑2), which mediates inflammatory reactions. In contrast, 2DG reduces type II collagen and COX‑2 expression while driving ER‑stress‑induced unglycosylation. In the present study, it was investigated whether GT could attenuate 2DG‑induced dedifferentiation and ER‑stress. Following treatment with GT and 2DG, chondrocytes were assessed using western blotting, RT‑PCR, immunofluorescence, and alcian blue staining. GT restored type II collagen expression that was reduced by 2DG, inhibited ER‑stress‑induced COX‑2 unglycosylation, and induced COX‑2 expression. The expression of a glucose‑regulated protein, GRP78, which is an indicator of reduced ER‑stress, was decreased. To link the GT signaling pathway with pathways that inhibit 2DG‑induced dedifferentiation and ER‑stress, inhibitors were treated in chondrocytes. The results revealed that, among the different signaling pathways triggered by ER‑stress, the p38 kinase pathway was involved in the inositol‑requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) downstream signaling pathway. Following inhibition of the IRE1 pathway, type II collagen expression was increased and COX‑2 expression was decreased. In addition, after examining the splicing of X‑box binding protein 1 (XBP‑1) which is dependent on IRE1 activation induced by ER‑stress, it was revealed that GT inhibited the increase of XBP‑1s after splicing due to 2DG‑induced ER stress. GT in chondrocytes inhibited 2DG‑induced dedifferentiation and ER‑stress‑induced COX‑2 unglycosylation while regulating differentiation and  via the ER‑stress‑induced p38 kinase pathway downstream from the IRE1 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661640>HMGB2 is a negative regulator of telomerase activity in human embryonic stem and progenitor cells.</a></h2><p>High-mobility group box (HMGB)1 and HMGB2 proteins are the subject of intensive research because of their involvement in DNA replication, repair, transcription, differentiation, proliferation, cell signaling, , and tumor migration. Using inducible, stably transfected human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) capable of the short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of  and , we provide evidence that deregulation of  or  expression in hESCs and their differentiated derivatives (neuroectodermal cells) results in distinct modulation of telomere homeostasis. Whereas HMGB1 enhances telomerase activity, HMGB2 acts as a negative regulator of telomerase activity in the cell. Stimulation of telomerase activity in the HMGB2-deficient cells may be related to activation of the PI3K/protein kinase B/ glycogen synthase kinase-3β/β-catenin signaling pathways by HMGB1, augmented TERT/telomerase RNA subunit transcription, and possibly also because of changes in telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) and TERRA-polyA transcription. The impact of  KD on telomerase transcriptional regulation observed in neuroectodermal cells is partially masked in hESCs by their pluripotent state. Our findings on differential roles of HMGB1 and HMGB2 proteins in regulation of telomerase activity may suggest another possible outcome of HMGB1 targeting in cells, which is currently a promising approach aiming at increasing the anticancer activity of cytotoxic agents.-Kučírek, M., Bagherpoor, A.

Taking advantage of this possibility, TuMV virus-like particles (VLPs) have been genetically derivatized with a peptide from the chaperonin Hsp60, a protein described to be involved in  processes and autoimmune diseases. Antibodies against the peptide have been previously shown to have a diagnostic value in at least one autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis. The functionalized Hsp60-VLPs showed their significant increase in sensing potency when compared to monoclonal antibody detection of the peptide in a conventional immunoassay. Additionally, the developed Hsp60-VLPs allowed the detection of autoantibodies against the Hsp60 peptide in an in vivo mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. The detection of minute amounts of the autoantibodies allowed us to perform the analysis of their evolution during the progression of the disease. The anti-Hsp60 autoantibody levels in the sera of the inflamed mice went down during the induction phase of the disease. Increased levels of the anti-HSP60 autoantibodies were detected during the resolution phase of the disease. An extension of a previously proposed model for the involvement of Hsp60 in inflammatory processes is considered, incorporating a role for Hsp60 autoantibodies. This, and related models, can now be experimentally tested thanks to the autoantibody detection hypersensitivity provided by the functionalized VLPs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662770>Therapeutic Efficacy of Kangfuxin Liquid Combined with PPIs in Gastric Ulcer.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Kangfuxin liquid (KFX) combined with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in the treatment of gastric ulcer (GU).Electronic databases including PubMed, Wanfang, CNKI, VIP, Embase, Cochrane Library, and CBM were examined for appropriate articles without language limitations on key words before March 10, 2019.

One of the mechanisms associated with the regulation of intracellular calcium is linked to ERK (Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase) and its phosphorylated condition (pERK). ERK phosphorylation is important for intracellular signal transduction and participates in regulating neuroplasticity and inflammatory responses. The aim of this study is to analyse the expression of two CaBPs and pERK in astrocytes and neurons in rat trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc) after experimental periapical  on the left mandibular first molar. At seven days post-treatment, the periapical inflammatory stimulus induces an increase in pERK expression both in S100b positive astrocytes and Calbindin D28k positive neurons, in the ipsilateral Vc with respect to the contralateral side and control group. pERK was observed coexpressing with S100b in astrocytes and in fusiform Calbindin D28k neurons in lamina I.

However, how maternal IL-6 associates with the trajectory of brain development remains unclear. We investigated whether maternal IL-6 levels during pregnancy relate to offspring amygdala volume development and anxiety-like behavior in Japanese macaques. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was administered to 39 Japanese macaque offspring (Female: 18), providing at least one or more time points at 4, 11, 21, and 36 months of age with a behavioral assessment at 11 months of age. Increased maternal third trimester plasma IL-6 levels were associated with offspring's smaller left amygdala volume at 4 months, but with more rapid amygdala growth from 4 to 36 months. Maternal IL-6 predicted offspring anxiety-like behavior at 11 months, which was mediated by reduced amygdala volumes in the model's intercept (i.e., 4 months). The results increase our understanding of the role of maternal  in the development of neurobehavioral disorders by detailing the associations of a commonly examined inflammatory indicator, IL-6, on amygdala volume growth over time, and anxiety-like behavior.© The Author(s) 2019.

Demographic data, operation and postoperative data were recorded. There were 191 MIBC patients who underwent radical cystectomy. After detailed analyses, preoperative SII was calculated by the formula as "(neutrophil) × (platelet)/(lymphocyte)". Cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were examined. The prognostic value of SII was analysed with univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was used to determine the optimum SII. Significant P was P < 0.05.The mean follow-up was 37 ± 6.7 months. The mean age of patients was 62.1 ± 9 years. The optimal cutoff value of SII was determined as 843 in ROC curve (area under the curve: 0.9; P < 0.001). The CSS and OS were significantly poor in patients with higher SII level (respectively; P < 0.001, P = 0.04). Gender, lymph node involvement, pathologic stage, grade and SII were statistically significant in multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model for CSS.Preoperative elevated SII could be an independent prognostic factor in MIBC patients who underwent radical cystectomy.

Nonetheless, little insight exists on other immune subsets involved in the cardiotoxic response.  Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to map the cardiac immune composition in the standard murine non-ischemic, pressure-overload HF model. By focusing our analysis on CD45 cells, we obtained a higher resolution identification of the immune cell subsets in the heart, at early and late stages of disease and in controls. We then integrated our findings using multi-parameter flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and tissue clarification immunofluorescence, in mouse and human.  We found that most major immune cell subpopulations, including macrophages, B cells, T cells and regulatory T cells (Treg), dendritic cells, NK cells, neutrophils and mast cells are present in both healthy and diseased hearts. Most cell subsets are found within the myocardium, whilst mast cells are found also in the epicardium. Upon induction of pressure overload, immune activation occurs across the entire range of immune cell types. Activation led to upregulation of key subset-specific molecules, such as Osm in pro-inflammatory macrophages and PD-1 in Treg, that may help explain clinical findings such as the refractivity of HF patients to anti-TNF therapy and cardiac toxicity during anti-PD-1 cancer immunotherapy, respectively.  Despite the absence of infectious agents or an autoimmune trigger, induction of disease leads to immune activation that involves far more cell types than previously thought, including neutrophils, B cells, NK cells and mast cells. This opens up the field of cardio-immunology to further investigation using toolkits that have already been developed to study the immune subsets above. The subset-specific molecules that mediate their activation may thus become useful targets for diagnostics or therapy of HF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663353>Nod-like receptor protein 3 and nod-like receptor protein 1 inflammasome activation in the hippocampal region of postmortem methamphetamine chronic user.</a></h2><p>Methamphetamine (Meth) is one of the most important central nervous system (CNS) stimulant abuse drugs that cause long-term or permanent damage to different regions of the brain, particularly hippocampus, by neuronal apoptosis and .

However, the mechanisms leading to increased platelet aggregability associated with smoking are only partially defined. A potential role has been hypothesized for immature platelets, a younger and potentially more reactive fraction, previously associated to the main determinants of coronary artery disease (CAD). Therefore, the aim of our study was to define the impact of smoking on the immature platelet fraction (IPF) and its relationship with prevalence and extent of coronary artery disease.We enrolled a cohort of consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography in a single center. Significant CAD was defined as at least 1 vessel stenosis >50%, while severe CAD was defined as left main and/or three-vessel disease. IPF was measured at admission by routine blood cells count (A Sysmex XE-2100).We included in our study 2553 patients, that were divided according smoking status (active smokers: 512; non-active smokers: 2041). Smokers were younger, more frequent males, with lower rate of diabetes mellitus, previous PCI, previous CABG (p<0.001, respectively) and were in treatment less often with ARB, BB, nitrates, statins, ASA, Clopidogrel, CCB, diuretics (p<0.001, respectively) as compared to non-active smokers. Higher percentage of smokers was observed in patients with higher IPF values, and at multivariate analysis active smoking resulted an independent predictor of higher IPF (adjusted OR[95%CI]=1.59[1.03-2.45] P=0.035). Among smokers, higher IPF were associated to lower ejection fraction (p=0.034), percentage of acute coronary syndrome (p=0.002) and platelet count (p<0.001) compared to ones with lower IPF. However, the IPF (according to quartiles values) were not associated to the prevalence and extent of CAD (82.5%, 80.4%, 86.1%, 80.9%, from 1 to 4 quartile, respectively,adjusted OR[95%CI]=0.98[0.79-1.23] P=0.89) and severe CAD (31%, 31.1%, 39.1%, 35.2%,from 1 to 4 quartile, respectively, adjusted OR[95%CI]=1.03[0.86-1.23] P=0.76).The present study shows an independent association between active smoking and the levels of immature platelet fraction in patients undergoing coronary angiography. However, among active smokers, IPF did not result an independent predictor of CAD or severe CAD.© 2019 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659144>Adipose tissue-derived Omentin-1 attenuates arterial calcification via AMPK/Akt signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue-derived adipokines mediate various kind of crosstalk between adipose tissue and other organs and thus regulate metabolism balance,  state as well as disease progression.

Here, we aim to analyse a panel of circulating miRNAs in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice and individuals with type 1 diabetes.We adopted standardised methodologies for extracting miRNAs from small sample volumes to evaluate a profiling panel of mature miRNAs in paired plasma and laser-captured microdissected immune-infiltrated islets of recently diabetic and normoglycaemic NOD mice. Moreover, we validated the findings during disease progression and remission after anti-CD3 therapy in NOD mice, as well as in individuals with type 1 diabetes.Plasma levels of five miRNAs were downregulated in diabetic vs normoglycaemic mice.

Finally, plasma miR-409-3p levels were lower in people recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes compared with a non-diabetic control group, and levels were inversely correlated with HbA levels.We propose that miR-409-3p may represent a new circulating biomarker of islet  and type 1 diabetes severity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665497>Retention and response rates in 14 261 PsA patients starting TNF inhibitor treatment-results from 12 countries in EuroSpA.</a></h2><p>To investigate TNF inhibitor (TNFi) retention and response rates in European biologic-naïve patients with PsA.Prospectively collected data on PsA patients in routine care from 12 European registries were pooled. Heterogeneity in baseline characteristics between registries were explored (analysis of variance and pairwise comparison). Retention rates (Kaplan-Meier), clinical remission [28-joint count DAS (DAS28) <2.6; 28 joint Disease Activity index for Psoriatic Arthritis ⩽4] and ACR criteria for 20% improvement (ACR20)/ACR50/ACR70 were calculated, including LUNDEX adjustment.Overall, 14 261 patients with PsA initiated a first TNFi. Considerable heterogeneity of baseline characteristics between registries was observed. The median 12-month retention rate (95% CI) was 77% (76, 78%), ranging from 68 to 90% across registries. Overall, DAS28/28 joint Disease Activity index for Psoriatic Arthritis remission rates at 6 months were 56%/27% (LUNDEX: 45%/22%). Six-month ACR20/50/70 responses were 53%/38%/22%, respectively. In patients initiating a first TNFi after 2009 with registered fulfilment of ClASsification for Psoriatic ARthritis (CASPAR) criteria (n = 1980) or registered one or more swollen joint at baseline (n = 5803), the retention rates and response rates were similar to those found overall.Approximately half of >14 000 patients with PsA who initiated first TNFi treatment in routine care were in DAS28 remission after 6 months, and three-quarters were still on the drug after 1 year. Considerable heterogeneity in baseline characteristics and outcomes across registries was observed. The feasibility of creating a large European database of PsA patients treated in routine care was demonstrated, offering unique opportunities for research with real-world data.© The Author(s) 2019.

Miscellaneous systemic  in the right auricle as well as nasal and laryngeal cartilage was also evident together with vestibular and auditory nerve disorders. According to his clinical signs and the results of color Doppler ultrasonography, positron emission tomography and computed tomography, and a biopsy of the right auricle, we made a diagnosis of RP.Given that RP is potentially fatal, it is important that the condition be diagnosed early and treated promptly. Ophthalmologists should be aware that RP is a potential cause of recurrent and refractory multiple ocular inflammatory disorders associated with systemic symptoms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660511>A rare case of stiff left atrial syndrome caused by both coconut left atrium and vertebral compression: a case report.</a></h2><p>Calcification of the left atrium (LA) is a rare condition and can be the result of long-standing rheumatic mitral stenosis or an unusual complication after mitral valve replacement. Cases of massive LA calcification have sometimes been referred to as those with 'coconut LA' or 'porcelain LA'.A 75-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of chest discomfort and exertional dyspnoea. Doppler echocardiography revealed the presence of elevated filling pressure with significant LA dysfunction. A cardiac catheter examination revealed a quite impressive pulmonary capillary wedge pressure waveform with a steep up-slope and prominent  wave of 43 mmHg (mean: 15 mmHg). Multidetector row computed tomography revealed that LA was sandwiched by dense calcifications along the roof and bottom of the LA, and the posterior wall was compressed by a vertebral body. Integration of these functional and anatomical findings ultimately led to the diagnosis of 'stiff LA syndrome'.She had a history of tuberculosis but no history of rheumatic fever or cardiac surgery. Thus, it appeared that the tuberculous pericarditis might have led to the calcified LA by long lasting . In this case, the LA was encased by a dense calcification and compressed by vertebral body from the posterior direction. Therefore, we speculated that the LA pressure could easily elevate even with a slight haemodynamic load in this special case, and thus eventually resulting in decompensated heart failure.© The Author(s) 2019.

It manifests in childhood and usually resolves after puberty but may also persist into adulthood. JRP is characterized by recurrent episodes of unilateral or/and bilateral parotid swelling with pain, reduction of salivary secretion, swallowing difficulty, fever, and malaise. The cause of this condition remains obscure. Throughout the last two decades, many therapeutic methods have been used in order to reduce the frequency and severity of JRP. During the acute episodes, conservative approaches (antibiotics, analgesics, sialogogues, massage of the parotid gland, and mouth rinses) are used. Parotidectomy has been suggested in rare selective occasions. Recently, a promising concept of sialendoscopy, which is a minimal invasive endoscopic technique, has been applied. This review outlines the literature on JRP focusing on methods and challenges in diagnosing JRP along with the differential diagnosis of JRP and the function of the parotid during JRP. In addition, we describe the treatment options for JRP, pointing out the importance of sialendoscopy as a diagnostic and treatment procedure that offers improvement in patients' daily life.Copyright © 2019 Efimia Papadopoulou-Alataki et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660868>Aging progression of human gut microbiota.</a></h2><p>Human gut microbiota are important for human health and have been regarded as a "forgotten organ", whose variation is closely linked with various factors, such as host genetics, diet, pathological conditions and external environment. The diversity of human gut microbiota has been correlated with aging, which was characterized by different abundance of bacteria in various age groups. In the literature, most of the previous studies of age-related gut microbiota changes focused on individual species in the gut community with supervised methods. Here, we aimed to examine the underlying aging progression of the human gut microbial community from an unsupervised perspective.We obtained raw 16S rRNA sequencing data of subjects ranging from newborns to centenarians from a previous study, and summarized the data into a relative abundance matrix of genera in all the samples. Without using the age information of samples, we applied an unsupervised algorithm to recapitulate the underlying aging progression of microbial community from hosts in different age groups and identify genera associated to this progression. Literature review of these identified genera indicated that for individuals with advanced ages, some beneficial genera are lost while some genera related with  and cancer increase.The multivariate unsupervised analysis here revealed the existence of a continuous aging progression of human gut microbiota along with the host aging process. The identified genera associated to this aging process are meaningful for designing probiotics to maintain the gut microbiota to resemble a young age, which hopefully will lead to positive impact on human health, especially for individuals in advanced age groups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664603>Increased mortality in elderly patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome is not explained by host response.</a></h2><p>Advanced age is associated with increased mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients. Preclinical studies suggest that the host response to an injurious challenge is age-dependent. In ARDS patients, we investigated whether the association between age and mortality is mediated through age-related differences in the host response.This was a prospective longitudinal observational cohort study, performed in the ICUs of two university-affiliated hospitals. The systemic host response was characterized in three predefined age-groups, based on the age-tertiles of the studied population: young (18 to 54 years, N = 209), middle-aged (55 to 67 years, N = 213), and elderly (67 years and older, N = 196). Biomarkers of , endothelial activation, and coagulation were determined in plasma obtained at the onset of ARDS. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. A mediation analysis was performed to examine whether age-related differences in biomarker levels serve as potential causal pathways mediating the association between age and mortality.Ninety-day mortality rates were 30% (63/209) in young, 37% (78/213) in middle-aged, and 43% (84/196) in elderly patients. Middle-aged and elderly patients had a higher risk of death compared to young patients (adjusted odds ratio, 1.5 [95% confidence interval 1.0 to 2.3] and 2.1 [1.4 to 3.4], respectively). Relative to young patients, the elderly had significantly lower systemic levels of biomarkers of  and endothelial activation. Tissue plasminogen activator, a marker of coagulation, was the only biomarker that showed partial mediation (proportion of mediation, 10 [1 to 28] %).Little evidence was found that the association between age and mortality in ARDS patients is mediated through age-dependent differences in host response pathways. Only tissue plasminogen activator was identified as a possible mediator of interest.This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier  , date of registration July 23, 2013).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662264>Exposure to both formaldehyde and high relative humidity exacerbates allergic asthma by activating the TRPV4-p38 MAPK pathway in Balb/c mice.</a></h2><p>Some studies have indicated that formaldehyde, a ubiquitous environmental pollutant, can induce or aggravate allergic asthma. Epidemiological studies have also shown that the relative humidity indoors may be an independent and a key factor associated with the aggravation of allergic asthma. However, the synergy of humidity and formaldehyde on allergic asthma and the mechanism underlying this effect remain largely unknown. In this study, we aim to determine the effect of high relative humidity and/or formaldehyde exposure on allergic asthma and explore the underlying mechanisms. Male Balb/c mice were modeled with ovalbumin (OVA) and exposure to 0.5 mg/m formaldehyde and/or different relative humidity (60%/75%/90%). Histopathological changes, pulmonary function, Th1/Th2 balance, the status of mucus hypersecretion and the levels of inflammatory factors were detected to assess the exacerbation of allergic asthma. The levels of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), calcium ion and the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK) were detected to explore the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that exposure to high relative humidity or to 0.5 mg/m formaldehyde alone had a slight, but not significant, affect on allergic asthma. However, the pathological response and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) were greatly aggravated by simultaneous exposure to 0.5 mg/m formaldehyde and 90% relative humidity. Blocking TRPV4or p38 MAPK using HC-067047 and SB203580 respectively, effectively alleviated the exacerbation of allergic asthma induced by this simultaneous exposure to formaldehyde and high relative humidity. The results show that when formaldehyde and high relative humidity are present this can enhance the activation of the TRPV4 ion channel in the lung leading to the aggravation of the p38 MAPK activation, resulting in the exacerbation of  and hypersecretion of mucus in the airways.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although microRNAs (miRNAs) are known to have roles in -related disorders, the exact role of miR-34b in DN has not been defined, and the regulatory mechanism has been unclear. This study aimed to clarify the role of miR-34b in DN pathogenesis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Expression of miR-34b, IL-6R, and other key factors of , apoptosis (TNF-alpha, IL-1ß, IL-6, caspase-3) in high glucose (HG)-induced HK-2 cells were measured by real-time PCR, Western blot, and flow cytometric cell apoptosis assays. We used luciferase reporter assay to detect the target of miR-34b. Moreover, the targeting gene of miR-34b and its downstream JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway were explored. RESULTS It was demonstrated that miR-34b overexpression inhibited apoptosis and expression levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1ß, IL-6, and caspase-3 in HG-treated HK-2 cells. We also found that IL-6R is a direct target of miR-34b, which could rescue  and apoptosis in HG-treated HK-2 cells transfected with miR-34b mimic. Furthermore, we showed that overexpression of miR-34b inhibited the IL-6R/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in HG-treated HK-2 cells. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that overexpression of miR-34b improves  and ameliorates apoptosis in HG-induced HK-2 cells via the IL-6R/JAK2/STAT3 pathway, indicating that miR-34b could be a promising therapeutic target in DN.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663542>Tannic acid-based nanogel as an efficient anti-inflammatory agent.</a></h2><p>Biologically produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important signaling molecules in the human body. Despite their importance under normal conditions, abnormal overproduction of ROS under unbalanced or irregular homeostasis can cause severe inflammatory diseases. Various antioxidants have been developed in the biomedical field to resolve high levels of ROS; however, high doses of natural antioxidants such as polyphenol can induce side effects on health. Further, synthetic antioxidants are still controversial in regards to their safety and their complicated synthesis. Inspired from our previous work, a nitric oxide-scavenging nanogel designed for treating rheumatoid arthritis, we report herein a biocompatible tannic acid (TA)-based nanogel as an effective ROS scavenger. A polymeric phenylboronic acid-tannic acid nanogel (PTNG) was prepared by simply mixing through to the formation of phenylboronic ester bonds between polymeric phenylboronate and TA. We focused on the reaction of phenylboronic ester with H2O2, which readily consumes H2O2 molecules, and applied it as an antioxidant. In addition, TA is a well-known antioxidant, specifically a free radical scavenger; thus, we expected combinatory ROS scavenging effects for PTNG. Various ROS scavenging assays revealed the significant antioxidant effects of PTNG. Under an induced  model in vitro, our PTNG showed high biocompatibility as well as strong anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, in the zymosan-induced peritonitis mouse model, a representative acute  model in vivo, PTNG reduced significant neutrophil recruitment and pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicating successful alleviation of . On the basis of these results, we suggest that PTNG has great potential as an antioxidant and should find application in the treatment of further ROS-overproducing inflammatory diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659812>Anti-inflammatory properties of fermented pine (Pinus morrisonicola Hay.) needle on lipopolysaccharide-induced  in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells.</a></h2><p>This study was aimed to explore the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of various pine needle products (non-fermented, fermented, and commercial) extracted with different solvents (hexane, ethyl acetate, and water) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced RAW 264.7 cells. The phenolic/flavonoid contents of ethyl acetate extract of fermented pine needle (EAE-FPN) is higher than other pine product extracts (hexane/water). The levels of antioxidant indices (TEAC, DPPH) as well as free radical scavenging activity (H O ) were significantly improved in EAE-FPN than other pine needle product extracts. The levels of ROS and various inflammatory markers (NO, PGE2, TNF-α, and IL-1β/6) were considerably abolished by EAE-FPN in a dose-dependent manner (50-200 μg/ml). Moreover, the protein expressions of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and nuclear factor Kappa B (NF-κB) p65 subunit were also markedly downregulated by EAE-FPN. Collectively, EAE-FPN with phenolic/flavonoid content showed excellent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties via modulating NF-κB signaling pathway. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Pine needle drink (Pinus morrisonicola Hay) has been used as a functional beverage for many years due to its various biological properties in Asia especially in Taiwan, China, and Korea. Many researchers hinted various biological activity of fermented pine needle product but none of them explored the in-depth mechanism underpinning its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cell model. Hence, the current cell line study was designed to assess the underlying mechanism behind the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of Pine needles extract (both non-fermented and fermented) in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells (macrophage). The outcome of this study distinctly showed that EAE-FPN displayed potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities by regulating NF-κB signaling pathway. Therefore, pine needle could be developed into functional drink to abolish the progression of inflammatory responses in various disease condition.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661433>Role of Nanomedicine in Redox Mediated Healing at Molecular Level.</a></h2><p>Nanomedicine, the offspring born from the marriage of nanotechnology and medicine, has already brought momentous advances in the fight against a plethora of unmet diseases from cardiovascular and neurodegenerative to diabetes and cancer. Here, we review a conceptual framework that will provide a basic understanding about the molecular mechanism of action of a therapeutic nanomaterial inside biological milieu. In this review, we highlight how the catalytic nature of a transition metal oxide nanomaterial influences the cellular redox homeostasis, supports the cellular antioxidant defence system and reactivates the reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated signalling to perform normal cell functions like cell cycle, differentiation, apoptosis, , toxicity, and protein interactions. With numerous examples, we describe the redox modulatory nature of d-block metal oxide nanomaterials and their biomimetic nanozyme activities to protect the mitochondria, the cellular redox mediator which prevents an organism from various diseases. This knowledge will be useful to design new nanomaterials capable of intracellular redox modulation, which in turn can be effective therapeutic agents for treatment of various unmet diseases that are beyond the ability of modern synthetic medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658714>Night Temperature Affects the Growth, Metabolism, and Photosynthetic Gene Expression in  and  Plug Seedlings.</a></h2><p> and  are two important medical herbs used in traditional Oriental medicine for preventing cancer, obesity, and . Night temperature is an important factor that influences the plug seedling quality. However, little research has focused on how the night temperature affects the growth and development of plug seedlings of these two medicinal species. In this study, uniform plug seedlings were cultivated in three environmentally controlled chambers for four weeks under three sets of day/night temperatures (25/10 °C, 25/15 °C, or 25/20 °C), the same relative humidity (75%), photoperiod (12 h), and light intensity (150 μmol·m·s PPFD) provided by white LEDs. The results showed that night temperature had a marked influence on the growth and development of both species. The night temperature of 15 °C notably enhanced the quality of plug seedlings evidenced by the increased shoot, root, and leaf dry weights, stem diameter, and Dickson's quality index. Moreover, a night temperature of 15 °C also stimulated and increased contents of primary and secondary metabolites, including soluble sugar, starch, total phenols and flavonoids. Furthermore, the 15 °C night temperature increased the chlorophyll content and stomatal conductance and decreased the hydrogen peroxide content. Analysis of the gene expression showed that  (),  (), and  () were up-regulated when the night temperature was 15 °C.

Cells have well-defined different membrane-surrounded organelles like mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, peroxisomes, etc., however, on demand they can create membrane-less organelles as stress granules, nucleoli and P bodies to cover vital functions and regulatory activities. However, the mechanism of intracellular molecule assembly into functional compartments within a living cell remains till now not fully understood. (Soft Matter 2019, 15 (6):1135-1154). In vitro and in vivo investigations unveiled that MLOs emerge after preceding liquid-liquid, liquid-gel, liquid-semi-crystalline, or liquid-crystalline phase separations. Liquid-liquid and liquid-gel MLOs form the majority of cellular phase separation events, while the occurrence of micro-sized crystals in cells was only rarely observed, however can be considered as a result of a preceding protein phase separation event. In vivo, also known and termed as in cellulo crystals, are reported since 1853 (Botanische Zeitung, 13, 881-8 821 855; CR Mem. Soc. Biol. 5, 450-454, 1853). In some cases, they have been linked to vital cellular functions, such as storage and detoxification. However, the occurrence of in cellulo crystals is also associated to diseases like cataract, hemoglobin C diseases etc. (Biology Chemistry De Gruyter 2018, 399 (7):751-752). Therefore, better knowledge about the involved molecular processes will support drug discovery investigations to cure diseases related to in cellulo crystallization.

It is a key player in some types of hereditary angioedema and is involved in septic shock, traumatic injury, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and stroke, among others. Activation of the plasma contact system leads to elevated levels of plasma kallikrein, which cleaves high molecular weight kininogen (HK) to release bradykinin. Drug development for bradykinin-meditated pathologies has focused on designing inhibitors to the enzymes that cleave HK (to prevent bradykinin release) or antagonists of endothelial bradykinin receptors (to prevent downstream bradykinin action). Here we show a strategy to block bradykinin generation by using an HK antibody that binds to HK, preventing its cleavage and subsequent bradykinin release. We show that this antibody blocks dextran sodium sulfate-induced HK cleavage and bradykinin production. Moreover, while the pathogenic AD peptide β-amyloid (Aβ)42 cleaves HK and induces a dramatic increase in bradykinin production, our HK antibody blocked these events from occurring. These results may provide strategies for developing treatments for bradykinin-driven pathologies.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Regulatory (Treg) and Th17 cytokines play a key role in regulating the immune response involved in this process. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Treg and Th17 cells in chronic inflammatory periapical disease, by comparing the expression of the immunoregulatory mediators TGF-β, IL-10, CCL4, and the proinflammatory IL-17 and CCL20 in the periapical tissue of teeth with pulp necrosis, with and without associated chronic lesions. Eighty-six periapical tissue samples were obtained from human teeth. The samples were divided into three groups: pulp necrosis with a periapical lesion (n=26); pulp necrosis without a periapical lesion (n=30), and control (n=30). All samples were submitted to histopathological analysis and cytokine and chemokine measurement through ELISA. Statistical analyses were done with Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests and Spearman correlation. The group with pulp necrosis and a periapical lesion showed a higher expression of CCL4 and TGF-β in comparison with pulp necrosis without a lesion. CCL20 was higher in the group with a periapical lesion when compared to the control. In all groups there was a weak positive correlation between IL-17/CCL20, IL-10/CCL4, and IL-17/TGF-β. Both types of cytokines, pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory, occur simultaneously in periapical tissue. However, a rise in immunosuppressive cytokines and chemokines (CCL4 and TGF-β) in periapical lesions suggests a role of these cytokines in stable periapical disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663345>Decreased plasma levels of 25(OH)D in multiple sclerosis patients.

Vitamin D has anti-inflammatory and anti-Th1, Th17 activities, activates the function of regulatory T cells, shifts the immune response towards Th2, so it might be favorable for downregulation of the disease pathogenesis, and if  and Th1 and Th17 immunity are hyperactivated. The aim of our study was to highlight the role of vitamin D in multiple sclerosis pathogenesis.We investigated 178 patients with multiple sclerosis. Plasma levels of 25(OH)D and HMGB1 were investigated.Despite a regular use of VD by patients, the plasma levels of 25(0H)D were significantly decreased in 57% of them, 14.1% had VD deficiency (level of 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL) and more than 6 % of patients had VD severe deficiency with the plasma level of 25(OH)D < 12 ng/mL. The level of 25(OH)D negatively correlated with the severity of the disease (EDSS, index of progression, duration of the disease) and negative association was found also with Herbert´s six severity grades. HMGB1 levels were higher in patients (p < 0.0001).Our result showed that vitamin D deficiency plays a role in multiple sclerosis pathogenesis. We believe that administration of vitamin D to patients at a sufficient dose providing a physiological level of vitamin D could have a positive effect on the course of the disease. However, regular monitoring of vitamin D levels is required, which should be at least within 30-75 ng/mL, and even more, but below the toxicity limit (Tab. 6, Ref. 66).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662259>Genotoxicity and DNA damage signaling in response to complex mixtures of PAHs in biomass burning particulate matter from cashew nut roasting.</a></h2><p>Approximately 3 billion people world-wide are exposed to air pollution from biomass burning. Herein, particulate matter (PM) emitted from artisanal cashew nut roasting, an important economic activity worldwide, was investigated. This study focused on: i) chemical characterization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and oxygenated (oxy-) PAHs; ii) intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS); iii) genotoxic effects and time- and dose-dependent activation of DNA damage signaling, and iv) differential expression of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, , cell cycle arrest and DNA repair, using A549 lung cells. Among the PAHs, chrysene, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), benzo[b]fluoranthene, and benz[a]anthracene showed the highest concentrations (7.8-10 ng/m), while benzanthrone and 9,10-anthraquinone were the most abundant oxy-PAHs. Testing of PM extracts was based on B[a]P equivalent doses (B[a]P). IC values for viability were 5.7 and 3.0 nM B[a]P at 24 h and 48 h, respectively. At these low doses, we observed a time- and dose-dependent increase in intracellular levels of ROS, genotoxicity (DNA strand breaks) and DNA damage signaling (phosphorylation of the protein checkpoint kinase 1 - Chk1). In comparison, effects of B[a]P alone was observed at micromolar range. To our knowledge, no previous study has demonstrated an activation of pChk1, a biomarker used to estimate the carcinogenic potency of PAHs in vitro, in lung cells exposed to cashew nut roasting extracts. Sustained induction of expression of several important stress response mediators of xenobiotic metabolism (CYP1A1, CYP1B1), ROS and pro-inflammatory response (IL-8, TNF-α, IL-2, COX2), and DNA damage response (CDKN1A and DDB2) was also identified. In conclusion, our data show high potency of cashew nut roasting PM to induce cellular stress including genotoxicity, and more potently when compared to B[a]P alone. Our study provides new data that will help elucidate the toxic effects of low-levels of PAH mixtures from air PM generated by cashew nut roasting.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In Experiment 1, all LPS-treated lambs showed clinical signs of sickness including rhinorrhea, lethargy, and shivering, and systemic inflammatory responses of increased inflammatory genes levels and cortisol concentration. The lambs had increased respiratory and heart rates and rectal temperature and decreased average daily gain and feed intake. In Experiment 2, resveratrol significantly reduced WBCs and the expression levels of several genes associated with  response (, , ) and inhibited the signaling cascades of  and MAPKs by down-regulating the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines (, , , , ) induced by LPS.

Nuclear erythroid-related factor-2 (Nrf2) is a transcriptional regulator of several phase II antioxidant genes, including glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL). In this study, it was hypothesized that Crocin may mediate antioxidant signaling pathway to protect human lung epithelial cells against CS-mediated toxicity and oxidative stress via inducing glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis and activation of Nrf2 pathway. Alveolar epithelial cells (A549) were exposed to 1, 2.5 and 5% cigarette smoke extracts (CSE) with or without Crocin (500 μM). After 48 h exposure, the cytotoxicity, oxidant/antioxidant parameters and the Nrf2 pathway modification were assayed. Treatment of A549 cells with all concentrations of CSE dose dependently decreased cell viability, antioxidant levels, GCL and Nrf2 gene expression, which was associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species. Crocin not only restored CSE-depleted GSH levels by enhancing GCL expression via activation of Nrf2 but also quenched the CSE-generation and release of reactive oxygen species. Crocin attenuated CSE-mediated Nrf2 modifications, thereby inducing its nuclear accumulation associated with GCL gene transcription leading to enhanced GSH levels. By inducing GSH synthesis, Crocin attenuates CSE-mediated GSH depletion and protects cells against CSE-induced oxidative stress via Nrf2 pathway. These results may have implications in dietary modulation of natural antioxidants in treatment of pulmonary diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659208>Preventative effects of the partial RANKL peptide MHP1-AcN in a mouse model of imiquimod-induced psoriasis.</a></h2><p>We recently developed a partial peptide of receptor activator of nuclear factor-кB ligand (RANKL) known as microglial healing peptide 1 (MHP1-AcN), that inhibits Toll-like receptor (TLR)-related  through RANKL/RANK signaling in microglia and macrophages without promoting osteoclast activation. The abnormal activation of TLRs contributes to the initiation and maintenance of psoriasis, which is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that involves the aberrant expression of proinflammatory cytokines and the subsequent dermal γδ T cell and T helper 17 (Th17) cell responses. The inhibition of TLR-mediated  provides an important strategy to treat psoriasis. Here, we examined the preventative effects of MHP1-AcN in a mouse model of imiquimod (a TLR 7/8 agonist)-induced psoriasis. Topical imiquimod application induced psoriasis-like skin lesions on the ear and dorsal skin. Systemic administration of MHP1-AcN by daily subcutaneous injection significantly prevented the development of skin lesions, including erythema, scaling and thickening. Mice treated with MHP1-AcN showed reduced levels of skin Il6 mRNA at 32 h and reduced levels of Il23 and Il17a mRNA at d9. Serum levels of IL-6 and IL-23 were reduced at 32 h, and IL-17A was reduced at d9. These results indicated that MHP1-AcN could decrease imiquimod-induced IL-6, IL-23 and IL-17A production. MHP1-AcN is potentially an alternative treatment for psoriasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661783>A Lipidomic Analysis of Docosahexaenoic Acid (22:6, ω3) Mediated Attenuation of Western Diet Induced Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in Male  Mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major public health problem worldwide. NAFLD ranges in severity from benign steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are strongly associated with NAFLD, and the western diet (WD) is a major contributor to the onset and progression of these chronic diseases. Our aim was to use a lipidomic approach to identify potential lipid mediators of diet-induced NASH. We previously used a preclinical mouse (low density lipoprotein receptor null mouse,  model to assess transcriptomic mechanisms linked to WD-induced NASH and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6, ω3)-mediated remission of NASH. This report used livers from the previous study to carry out ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with dynamic multi-reaction monitoring (HPLC-dMRM) to assess the impact of the WD and DHA on hepatic membrane lipid and oxylipin composition, respectively. Feeding mice the WD increased hepatic saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4, ω6) in membrane lipids and suppressed ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in membrane lipids and ω3 PUFA-derived anti-inflammatory oxylipins. Supplementing the WD with DHA lowered hepatic ARA in membrane lipids and ARA-derived oxylipins and significantly increased hepatic DHA and its metabolites in membrane lipids, as well as C ω3 PUFA-derived oxylipins. NASH markers of  and fibrosis were inversely associated with hepatic C ω3 PUFA-derived Cyp2C- and Cyp2J-generated anti-inflammatory oxylipins (false discovery rate adjusted -value;  ≤ 0.026). Our findings suggest that dietary DHA promoted partial remission of WD-induced NASH, at least in part, by lowering hepatic pro-inflammatory oxylipins derived from ARA and increasing hepatic anti-inflammatory oxylipins derived from C ω3 PUFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665718>Landscape of Immune-Related Pneumonitis in Cancer Patients with Asthma Being Treated with Immune Checkpoint Blockade.</a></h2><p>Predicting the factors that increase the risk of immune-related pneumonitis, a potentially life-threatening complication of treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors for cancer, is a clinical challenge. Baseline clinical factors such as asthma may portend the development of pneumonitis due to pre-existing airway  prior to immunotherapy.The purpose of the study was to investigate whether a prior diagnosis of asthma is associated with an increased risk of immune-related pneumonitis in patients undergoing cancer immunotherapy.Patients at the Moores Cancer Center at UC San Diego Health undergoing immunotherapy were identified on an IRB-approved protocol. Clinical charts were reviewed for asthma documented in the medical records and CT scans were reviewed during and after treatment. Pneumonitis was defined as the onset of new pulmonary symptoms with characteristic imaging findings during or after a patient's first course of immunotherapy that could not be readily explained as infection or a progression of malignancy. It was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.A total of 187 patients were included. A diagnosis of asthma was found in the records of 26 cases (13.9%). Pneumonitis was found in 10 cases (5.35%); 50% were grade 2 and 50% were grade 3-4. Two of the grade 3-4 cases (40%) occurred in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. Three patients with asthma developed pneumonitis (11.5% of patients with asthma), all grade 3-4. Only 28.6% of the non-asthma-pneumonitis cases were grade 3-4. All (100%) of the asthma-pneumonitis patients were former smokers, while 71.4% of the non-asthma-pneumonitis patients were former smokers.A history of asthma may be associated with a higher grade of pneumonitis if it develops, and a history of smoking may augment this relationship.© 2019 S.

Patients receiving fluticasone propionate ≤500 mcg/day or equivalent were randomized (2:1) to GB001 (30 mg) or placebo once daily for 28 days. Safety, pharmacokinetics, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, asthma control questionnaire, and rescue medication use were assessed. Clinical outcomes were analyzed post-hoc by baseline fractional exhaled nitric oxide (<35 & ≥35 ppb) and blood eosinophils (<250 & ≥250 cells/µL) subgroups.GB001 was well tolerated and rapidly absorbed with a 14.5 hour terminal half-life. Overall, GB001 demonstrated greater improvement relative to placebo in forced expiratory volume in 1 second at Day 28 (102 ml [95% CI: -110, 314]). Greater effects on forced expiratory volume in 1 second were observed in the high baseline fractional exhaled nitric oxide and blood eosinophil subgroups (207 ml [95% CI: -283, 698];133 ml [95% CI: -422, 687], respectively).

Of all cancer-related deaths, 15 to 20% are associated with , where proinflammatory cytokines have been implicated in the tumorigenesis process. The current study investigated the effects of the polyphenolic compound butein (2',3,4,4'-tetrahydroxychalcone) on cell proliferation and survival, as well as its modulatory effect on the release of proinflammatory cytokines in MDA-MB-231 (Caucasian) and MDA-MB-468 (African American) TNBC cell. The results obtained showed that butein decreased cell viability in a time and dose-dependent manner, and after 72-h of treatment, the cell proliferation rate was reduced in both cell lines. In addition, butein was found to have higher potency in MDA-MB-468, exhibiting anti-proliferative effects in lower concentrations. Apoptosis assays demonstrated that butein (50 μM) increased apoptotic cells in MDA MB-468, showing 60% of the analyzed cells in the apoptotic phase, compared to 20% in MDA-MB-231 cells. Additionally, butein downregulated both protein and mRNA expression of the proinflammatory cytokine, CCL2, and IKBKE in TNFα-activated Caucasian cells, but not in African Americans. This study demonstrates butein potential in cancer cell suppression showing a higher cytotoxic, anti-proliferative, and apoptotic effects in African Americans, compared to Caucasians TNBC cells. It also reveals the butein inhibitory effect on CCL2 expression with a possible association with IKBKE downregulation in MDA-MB-231 cells only, indicating that Caucasians and African Americans TNBC cells respond differently to butein treatment. The obtained findings may provide an explanation regarding the poor therapeutic response in African American patients with advanced TNBC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662881>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy evidence for declining gliosis in MS patients treated with ocrelizumab versus interferon beta-1a.</a></h2><p>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy quantitatively monitors biomarkers of neuron-myelin coupling (N-acetylaspartate (NAA)), and  (total creatine (tCr), total choline (tCho), myo-inositol (mI)) in the brain.This study aims to investigate how ocrelizumab and interferon beta-1a differentially affects imaging biomarkers of neuronal-myelin coupling and  in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS).Forty patients with relapsing MS randomized to either treatment were scanned at 3T at baseline and weeks 24, 48, and 96 follow-up. Twenty-four healthy controls were scanned at weeks 0, 48, and 96. NAA, tCr, tCho, mI, and NAA/tCr were measured in a single large supra-ventricular voxel.There was a time × treatment interaction in NAA/tCr ( = 0.04), primarily driven by opposing tCr trends between treatment groups after 48 weeks of treatment. Patients treated with ocrelizumab showed a possible decline in mI after week 48 week, and stable tCr and tCho levels. Conversely, the interferon beta-1a treated group showed possible increases in mI, tCr, and tCho over 96 weeks.Results from this exploratory study suggest that over 2 years, ocrelizumab reduces gliosis compared with interferon beta-1a, demonstrated by declining ml, and stable tCr and tCho. Ocrelizumab may improve the physiologic milieu by decreasing neurotoxic factors that are generated by inflammatory processes.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661350>Therapeutic Effect of Topical Adiponectin-Derived Short Peptides Compared with Globular Adiponectin in Experimental Dry Eye and Alkali Burn.</a></h2><p> To evaluate the efficacy of adiponectin (APN)-derived short peptides (ADPs) 355 compared with globular APN in a mouse model of experimental dry eye (EDE) and corneal alkali burn.

NPC patients with distant metastasis have a particularly poor prognosis; however, evaluating metastatic potential by expression profiles of primary tumors is challenging. This study aimed to investigate the association between activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and NPC metastasis and the underlying mechanisms. We found an association between EGFR protein overexpression and intense EGFR immuno-staining in NPC samples with advanced tumor node metastasis stage, clinical stage and distant metastasis in NPC patients. Exogenous EGF stimulates NPC mobility and invasiveness in vitro. Activation of EGFR signaling prompted PKM2 translocation to the nucleus. Silencing either EGFR or PKM2 attenuates NPC cell aggressiveness in vitro and in vivo. Blocking EGFR signaling with cetuximab suppressed NPC cell invasiveness in vitro and metastatic potential in vivo. Comprehensive analyses of transcriptome profiles indicated that the EGFR-PKM2 axis activates a number of novel metastasis promoters, including F3, FOSL1, EPHA2, ANTXR2, and AKR1C2. Finally, we found that the metastasis-promoting function of the EGFR-PKM2 axis is dependent on nuclear PKM2 regulation of the transcription of metastasis-related genes, including FOSL1 and ANTXR2. Our study indicates that EGFR-PKM2 signaling promotes NPC cell invasion and metastasis through induction of FOSL1 and ANTXR2 and identifies EGFR as a promising biomarker for predicting the risk of distant metastasis.© The Author(s) 2019.

There has been concern about the effects of EMFs on the human body. Th9 cells, which are characterized by the generation of interleukin-(IL-9), are a recently defined subset of T helper (Th) cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of extremely low-frequency (60 Hz) EMFs, such as those generated by household power sources, at 0.8 mT intensity on CD4 T cells. The exposure of CD4 T cells to such EMFs under Th9-polarizing conditions increased IL-9 secretion and gene expression of transcription factors that are important for Th9 development. The expression of GATA3 increased in the early stage, and the phosphorylation of STAT5 and STAT6, which regulate the expression of GATA3, increased. In addition, EMFs increased the expression of IL-2 by the T cells. In conclusion, the differentiation of CD4 T cells to the Th9 phenotype was increased by exposure to extremely low-frequency EMFs, and this appeared to be dependent on the IL-2 signaling pathway. Furthermore, co-cultures of EMF-exposed Th9 cells and mast cells showed an increased expression of mast cell proteases, FcεR1α, and mast cell-derived inflammatory cytokines compared with co-cultures of non-EMF-exposed Th9 cells and mast cells.

In this study, further light is aimed to be shed on the secondary-metabolites composition of H. capitatum extracts, using chromatographic techniques and Electron paramagnetic resonance profiles in alkaline medium. Considering that no previous works explored the anti-inflammatory activity of H. capitatum, here, an in vivo study is also designed in order to evaluate this property by assessing the impact of one of H. capitatum extracts in ameliorating turpentine oil-induced  on rats and to quantify their blood antioxidants level.Chromatographic techniques and Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy were used in order to describe the chemical profile in different parts of the plant. The in vivo study on turpentine-oil induced  in rats included three doses of H. capitatum extract expressed in rutin concentration. Oxidative stress was measured using total oxidative status, total antioxidant capacity, oxidative stress index, 3-nitrotyrosine, nitric oxide, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, catalase and the inflammatory response was evaluated by performing a complete blood cells count and C reactive protein.The extract was remarkably rich in rutin; however, other polyphenolic-like minor components appeared important in explaining the observed biological properties. The tested extract prevents the increase of -induced white blood cell count, number of neutrophils, and serum nitric oxide, and did so in a dose-dependent manner, similarly to the positive control-diclofenac. In addition, the same extract appeared to be a good alternative to diclofenac to restore total oxidative status, thiobarbituric active reactive species, total proteins and C reactive proteins. Moreover, antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase and total serum thiol concentration were significantly increased by the tested extract.Due to its powerful reservoir rich in rutin, H. capitatum extract depicted its in vivo antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects indicating it to be a good alternative to conventional drugs for oxidative stress protection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661804>Sepsis and Nosocomial Infections: The Role of Medico-Legal Experts in Italy.</a></h2><p>Sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is defined as the presence of a Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome, and it represents a significant burden for the healthcare system. This is particularly true when it is diagnosed in the setting of nosocomial infections, which are usually a matter of concern with regard to medical liability being correlated with increasing economic costs and people's loss of trust in healthcare.

In this context, the role of medico-legal experts working in a hospital setting is fundamental for performing autopsy to diagnose sepsis and link it with possible nosocomial infections. On the other hand, medico-legal experts are party to the clinical risk management assessment, and deal with malpractice cases and therefore contribute to formulating clinical guidelines and procedures for improving patient safety and healthcare providers' work practices. Due to this scenario, the authors here discuss the role of medico-legal experts in Italy, focusing on sepsis and nosocomial infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663791>The clinical impact of growth differentiation factor-15 in heart disease: A 2019 update.</a></h2><p>Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), also known as macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-activated gene (NAG-1) has been identified as a biomarker of response to treatment and prognosis in cardiovascular diseases. GDF-15 is a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily and is involved in several pathological conditions such as , cancer, cardiovascular, pulmonary and renal diseases. Cardiac myocytes produce and secrete GDF-15 in response to oxidative stress, stimulation with angiotensin II or proinflammatory cytokines, ischemia, and mechanical stretch. Other cellular sources of GDF-15 production are macrophages, vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and adipocytes, which secrete GDF-15 in response to oxidative or metabolic stress or stimulation of proinflammatory cytokines. GDF-15 is induced in hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy after volume overload, ischemia, and heart failure. GDF-15 can be used as a marker of prognosis in patients with cardiovascular disorders, in combination with conventional prognostic factors, such as N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664570>Neural cell responses to wear debris from metal-on-metal total disc replacements.</a></h2><p>Total disc replacements, comprising all-metal articulations, are compromised by wear and particle production. Metallic wear debris and ions trigger a range of biological responses including , genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, hypersensitivity and pseudotumour formation, therefore we hypothesise that, due to proximity to the spinal cord, glial cells may be adversely affected.Clinically relevant cobalt chrome (CoCr) and stainless steel (SS) wear particles were generated using a six-station pin-on-plate wear simulator. The effects of metallic particles (0.5-50 μm debris per cell) and metal ions on glial cell viability, cellular activity (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression) and DNA integrity were investigated in 2D and 3D culture using live/dead, immunocytochemistry and a comet assay, respectively.CoCr wear particles and ions caused significant reductions in glial cell viability in both 2D and 3D culture systems. Stainless steel particles did not affect glial cell viability or astrocyte activation. In contrast, ions released from SS caused significant reductions in glial cell viability, an effect that was especially noticeable when astrocytes were cultured in isolation without microglia. DNA damage was observed in both cell types and with both biomaterials tested. CoCr wear particles had a dose-dependent effect on astrocyte activation, measured through expression of GFAP.The results from this study suggest that microglia influence the effects that metal particles have on astrocytes, that SS ions and particles play a role in the adverse effects observed and that SS is a less toxic biomaterial than CoCr alloy for use in spinal devices.

Parry Romberg syndrome (PRS) is also a very rare disease, and the underlying aetiology remains unknown. We present a rare case of CAAs in a patient with PRS, and discuss possible implications regarding the primary pathophysiological cause for both of these diseases.A 48-year-old woman with a history of PRS presented with atypical and non-exertional chest pain. Initial evaluation demonstrated a rising troponin without associated electrocardiogram changes, and as such she was taken for left heart catheterization. Left heart catheterization demonstrated diffuse aneurysmal and ectatic disease of multiple coronary arteries. Further evaluation with magnetic resonance angiogram and autoantibody panel did not demonstrate other vascular anomalies or rheumatologic disease, respectively. She was treated with dual anti-platelet therapy and statin, and at 1 year follow-up, she had resolution of her symptoms.It has been postulated that the underlying mechanism causing CAA is intravascular . Parry Romberg syndrome is theorized to be a neurovasculopathy, as evidenced by cases of associated intracranial aneurysms. Intravascular  may play a key pathological role in CAA, and an association between CAA and PRS may exist.© The Author(s) 2019.

This study aimed to investigate whether cortical neuron-released exosomal microRNA-181c-3p (miR-181c-3p) affected ischemic brain injury (IBI).An IBI rat model was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Astrocytes collected from rats were exposed to exosomes derived from cortical neurons to investigate the effect of exosomes on chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) expression and inflammatory response. Then, ectopic expression was induced in astrocytes treated with oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD).CXCL1 was identified to be an upregulated gene in IBI by microarray-based gene expression profiling. Additionally, upregulation of CXCL1 and promoted inflammatory response was also found in MCAO rats. miR-181c-3p was downregulated in OGD-treated cortical neurons and exosomes derived from OGD-treated cortical neurons. Exosomes derived from OGD-treated cortical neurons decreased the expression of CXCL1 and inflammatory factors in astrocytes, and exosomes delivered miR-181c-3p to decrease CXCL1 expression in astrocytes. CXCL1 was a target gene of miR-181c-3p. Delivery with miR-181c-3p mimic and siRNA against CXCL1 (si-CXCL1) was shown to inhibit  in astrocytes by downregulating CXCL1.Collectively, exosomal miR-181c-3p derived from cortical neurons exerts protective effects on neuroinflammation in astrocytes via downregulation of CXCL1 in an IBI rat model.© 2019 S.

The link between psoriatic condition and obesity is based on shared pathophysiological pathways where local and systemic  promote each other; PsO is an inflammatory, immune-mediated disease, and the adipose tissue is the source of proinflammatory adipokines. Moreover, psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an important comorbidity of PsO that reduces quality of life and makes difficult the patient's management. Treatment of obese subjects with moderate to severe PsO, even more if PsA is present, is challenging because of reduced efficacy of several systemic drugs and increased risk of adverse events. Secukinumab, a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to and neutralizes interleukin 17A, shows efficacy on PsO in all body weight groups, even in the highest, whose response has a slight downward trend.

CRMO is a diagnosis of exclusion, resulting in often-delayed diagnosis with over one year on average from onset of symptoms to time of diagnosis. Initial diagnosis is rare in adults and previously undocumented in the elderly (age greater than 65). We highlight a case of a 74-year-old elderly Caucasian female with a history of palmoplantar pustular psoriasis who presented with pelvic and hip pain. Imaging findings included multiple bony lesions on x-rays, increased uptake in the left side of the pelvis, ileum, proximal sternum, and bilateral medial clavicles on nuclear bone scan. Bone biopsy histologic results of marrow fibrosis and plasma cell infiltrate indicative of chronic  lead to the diagnosis of CRMO. This case highlights that while CRMO is typically a disease with childhood onset, it, while rare, can also present in adults and now has presented in the elderly, remaining an important part of the differential diagnosis of bone pain in adults and the elderly in addition to infectious osteomyelitis and malignancy when imaging reveals multiple bony lesions. This in turn will facilitate the reduction of unnecessary medical treatment and antibiotics.Copyright © 2019 Stacey Mahady and Amit Ladani.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659824>Proteomics Profiling of Swine Serum Following Lipopolysaccharide Stimulation.</a></h2><p>There are no approved animal drugs for management of  in swine due to lack of validated animal models.

About half of patients with IBD develop rheumatic ailments and microscopic intestinal  is present in up to half of CRD patients. IBD and CRD patients also share a common therapeutic armamentarium. Disequilibrium in the complex realm of microbes (known as dysbiosis) that closely interact with the gut mucosal immune system has been associated with both IBD and CRD (spondyloarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis). Whether dysbiosis represents an epiphenomenon or a prodromal feature remains to be determined.In an attempt to further investigate whether specific gut dysbiosis may be the missing link between IBD and CRD in patients developing both diseases, we performed here a systematic literature review focusing on studies looking at bacterial microbiota in CRD and/or IBD patients.We included 80 studies, with a total of 3799 IBD patients without arthritis, 1084 CRD patients without IBD, 132 IBD patients with arthropathy manifestations and 12 spondyloarthritis patients with IBD history. Overall, this systematic review indicates that an increase in s,  and  genera, as well as a decrease in  genera and species belonging to Verrucomicrobia and Fusobacteria phyla are common features in IBD and CRD patients, whereas dozens of bacterial species are specific features of CRD and IBD.Further work is needed to understand the functions of bacteria and of their metabolites but also to characterize fungi and viruses that are commonly found in these patients.© Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662455>Bacterial Pathogens Hijack the Innate Immune Response by Activation of the Reverse Transsulfuration Pathway.</a></h2><p>The reverse transsulfuration pathway is the major route for the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids. The role of this metabolic pathway in macrophage response and function is unknown. We show that the enzyme cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) is induced in macrophages infected with pathogenic bacteria through signaling involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/MTOR and the transcription factor SP1. This results in the synthesis of cystathionine, which facilitates the survival of pathogens within myeloid cells. Our data demonstrate that the expression of CTH leads to defective macrophage activation by (i) dysregulation of polyamine metabolism by depletion of -adenosylmethionine, resulting in immunosuppressive putrescine accumulation and inhibition of spermidine and spermine synthesis, and (ii) increased histone H3K9, H3K27, and H3K36 di/trimethylation, which is associated with gene expression silencing. Thus, CTH is a pivotal enzyme of the innate immune response that disrupts host defense. The induction of the reverse transsulfuration pathway by bacterial pathogens can be considered an unrecognized mechanism for immune escape. Macrophages are professional immune cells that ingest and kill microbes. In this study, we show that different pathogenic bacteria induce the expression of cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) in macrophages. This enzyme is involved in a metabolic pathway called the reverse transsulfuration pathway, which leads to the production of numerous metabolites, including cystathionine. Phagocytized bacteria use cystathionine to better survive in macrophages. In addition, the induction of CTH results in dysregulation of the metabolism of polyamines, which in turn dampens the proinflammatory response of macrophages. In conclusion, pathogenic bacteria can evade the host immune response by inducing CTH in macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662858>The gut virome in inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis: From metagenomics to novel therapeutic approaches.</a></h2><p>The association of intestinal dysbiosis with the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease has been well established. Besides bacteria, microbiota comprises yeasts, archaea, protists and viruses, neglected actors in inflammatory bowel disease-associated microbiota. In the past, a great limitation in studying microbiota composition was the low sensitivity of sequencing technologies and that few computational approaches were sufficient to thoroughly analyse the whole microbiome. However, new cutting-edge technologies in nucleic acid sequencing, -omics analysis and the innovative statistics and bioinformatics pipelines made possible more sensitive and accurate metagenomics, ultimately identifying novel players in intestinal , including prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses, that together form the gut virome.

Macrophages are broadly classified into pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, and M2 macrophages, which have selective anti-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic activities and are able to induce immunotolerance and angiogenesis. Based on these elements, the aim of our study was to evaluate CD14CD68CD197CD80 M1 and CD14CD68CD163CD206 M2 macrophages in tissue samples from ovarian endometriomas of women affected by endometriosis at different stages of the disease. For each patient, we collected a biological sample of the cyst (ovarian endometriomas for cases and ovarian functional cyst for controls) during laparoscopy. We found that the number of both M1 and M2 macrophages was significantly higher in endometriosis group than controls, regardless of stage ( < .0001 for each stage versus controls). Moreover, our data analysis shows a trend in progressive decrease of M1 macrophages from stage I to stage IV; on the contrary, M2 macrophages show a specular trend compared to M1 macrophages, with a progressive increase from stage I to stage IV.

This disease is a quiet but painful condition caused by chronically high blood glucose levels. It is reported that high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) participates in the development of neuropathic pain. This study aimed to explore the role of microRNA (miR)-193a in diabetic neuropathic pain through the regulation of HMGB1.A diabetic mouse model was established through the injection of streptozocin (STZ). Neuropathic pain development was shown by paw withdrawal thresholds and paw withdrawal latency. Expression levels of relative genes or miR were analyzed by qRT-PCR, while Western blot was employed to assess the protein levels. The interaction between miR-193a and HMGB1 mRNA 3'-UTR region was shown by luciferase assay. The levels of  cytokines were measured by ELISA kits.miR-193a expression was decreased and HMGB1 expression was upregulated in the lumbar spinal dorsal horn of STZ-induced diabetic mice. miR-193a inhibited HMGB1 expression in the lumbar spinal dorsal horn. Overexpression of miR-193a alleviated neuropathic pain in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Peripheral neuroinflammation in diabetic mice was suppressed by miR-193a overexpression.This research illustrates that miR-193a alleviates diabetic neuropathic pain in a mouse model through the inhibition of HMGB1 expression.© 2019 S.

Misregulation results in arthritis, sepsis and cancer, and there is an interest in modulating TTP activity with exogenous agents. Gold has anti-inflammatory properties and has recently been shown to modulate the signalling pathway that produces TTP, suggesting that TTP may be a target of gold.

Au(III) was found to replace zinc in the protein active site in the reduced Au(I) form, with the Au(I) ion coordinated to two cysteine residues in a linear geometry. The replacement of Zn(II) with Au(I) results in loss of both secondary structure and RNA binding function.

Of these, 616 were seen again 3 y later for the longitudinal analysis. Energy-adjusted DII (E-DII) was calculated from a validated diet history questionnaire. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using DXA. Twenty-four inflammatory biomarkers were analyzed. Incident falls over 3 y were determined through telephone interviews every 4 mo. Multiple regression, linear mixed effects models, negative binomial regression, and mediation analysis were utilized in this study.A higher E-DII score (indicating a more proinflammatory diet) was associated with higher concentrations of IL-6 (β: 0.028 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.053), IL-7 (β: 0.020 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.002, 0.037), and TNF-α (β: 0.027 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.051). A higher E-DII score was also associated with lower appendicular lean mass adjusted for BMI (ALMBMI) (β: -0.006 kg/m2; 95% CI: -0.010, -0.001).

Body weight and body composition were similar in both groups, despite higher food intake in mice on GLU+GAL diet. Hepatic TG content was lower in GLU+GAL-fed than GLU-fed females, while glycogen levels were unaffected. Analysis of global expression patterns of hepatic mRNA showed that mainly -related pathways were affected by the diet, which were predominantly downregulated in GLU+GAL-fed females compared to GLU-fed females.

Compared with participants with the lowest average BPA exposure (below the first quartile), participants in the second, third, and fourth quartile groups of exposure had a near doubling of the risk of type 2 diabetes, with a hazard ratio  2.56 (95% CI: 1.16, 5.65), 2.35 (95% CI: 1.07, 5.15), and 1.56 (95% CI: 0.68, 3.55), respectively. The detection of BPS-G in urine at one or both time points was associated with incident diabetes, with an  2.81 (95% CI: 1.74, 4.53).This study shows positive associations between exposure to BPA and BPS and the incidence of type 2 diabetes, independent of traditional diabetes risk factors. Our results should be confirmed by recent, population-based observational studies in different populations and settings. Overall, these findings raise concerns about using BPS as a BPA substitute. Further research on BPA analogs is warranted. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5159.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662319>FGFR3 deficiency enhances CXCL12-dependent chemotaxis of macrophages via upregulating CXCR7 and aggravates joint destruction in mice.</a></h2><p>This study aims to investigate the role and mechanism of FGFR3 in macrophages and their biological effects on the pathology of arthritis.Mice with conditional knockout of FGFR3 in myeloid cells (R3cKO) were generated. Gait behaviours of the mice were monitored at different ages. Spontaneous synovial joint destruction was evaluated by digital radiographic imaging and μCT analysis; changes of articular cartilage and synovitis were determined by histological analysis. The recruitment of macrophages in the synovium was examined by immunostaining and monocyte trafficking assay. RNA-seq analysis, Western blotting and chemotaxis experiment were performed on control and FGFR3-deficient macrophages. The peripheral blood from non-osteoarthritis (OA) donors and patients with OA were analysed. Mice were treated with neutralising antibody against CXCR7 to investigate the role of CXCR7 in arthritis.R3cKO mice but not control mice developed spontaneous cartilage destruction in multiple synovial joints at the age of 13 months. Moreover, the synovitis and macrophage accumulation were observed in the joints of 9-month-old R3cKO mice when the articular cartilage was not grossly destructed. FGFR3 deficiency in myeloid cells also aggravated joint destruction in DMM mouse model. Mechanically, FGFR3 deficiency promoted macrophage chemotaxis partly through activation of NF-κB/CXCR7 pathway. Inhibition of CXCR7 could significantly reverse FGFR3-deficiency-enhanced macrophage chemotaxis and the arthritic phenotype in R3cKO mice.Our study identifies the role of FGFR3 in synovial macrophage recruitment and synovitis, which provides a new insight into the pathological mechanisms of -related arthritis.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Accurate disease activity assessment is vital in both clinical and research settings, however, current available methods lack ability to quantify associated variation of physical activity, an important consequence of myositis.This study aims to review studies that have collected accelerometer-derived physical activity data in IIM populations, and to investigate if these studies identified associations between physical and myositis disease activity.A narrative review was conducted to identify original articles that have collected accelerometer-derived physical activity data in IIM populations. The following databases were searched from February 2000 until February 2019: Medline via PubMed, Embase via OVID and Scopus.Of the 297 publications screened, eight studies describing accelerometer use in 181 IIM cases were identified. Seven out of the eight studies investigated juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) populations and only one reported on an adult-onset population. Population sizes, disease duration, accelerometer devices used, body placement sites, and study duration varied between each study.Accelerometer-derived physical activity levels were reduced in IIM cohorts, compared to healthy controls, and studies reported improvement of physical activity levels following exercise programme interventions, thus demonstrating efficacy.Higher levels of accelerometer-derived physical activity measurements were associated with shorter JDM disease duration, current glucocorticoid use and lower serum creatine kinase. However, no clear association between muscle strength and accelerometer-derived physical activity measures was identified.The use of accelerometer-derived physical activity in IIM research is in its infancy. Whilst knowledge is currently limited to small studies, the opportunities are promising and future research in this area has the potential to improve disease activity assessment for clinical and research applications.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665463>Supplemental effects of dietary nucleotides on intestinal health and growth performance of newly weaned pigs.</a></h2><p>Intestinal challenges upon weaning would increase the needs of nucleotides for enterocyte proliferation whereas de novo synthesis maybe insufficient. This study aimed to evaluate supplemental effects of dietary nucleotides on intestinal health and growth performance in newly weaned pigs. Fifty newly weaned pigs (19-d-old, 25 barrows and 25 gilts, 4.76 ± 0.42 kg BW) were individually housed and allotted to 5 treatments with increasing nucleotide supplementation (0, 50, 150, 250, and 500 mg/kg) based on a randomized complete block design with the initial BW and sex as blocks. Dietary nucleotides were provided from YT500 (Hinabiotech, Guangzhou, China). Pigs were fed for 21 d based on 2 phases (Phase 1: 11 d and Phase 2: 10 d) and experimental diets were formulated to meet or exceed nutrient requirements suggested by NRC (2012). Feed intake and BW were recorded. Titanium oxide (0.4%) was added as an indigestible marker from d 17. Plasma collected on d 18 was used to measure tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Pigs were euthanized on d 21 to collect tissues to evaluate TNF-α, IL-6, MDA, morphology, and crypt cell proliferation rate in the jejunum. Ileal digesta were collected to measure ileal nutrient digestibility. Data were analyzed using contrasts in the MIXED procedure of SAS. Nucleotide supplementation increased (P < 0.05) ADFI in phase 1. Nucleotide supplementation at 50 and 150 mg/kg increased (P < 0.05) ADG in Phase 1, whereas increased (P < 0.05) ADFI and tended to increase (P = 0.082) ADG in overall. Increasing nucleotide supplementation changed (quadratic, P < 0.05) villus height-crypt ratio (at 247 mg/kg) and decreased (linear, P < 0.05) crypt cell proliferation rate in the jejunum. Increasing nucleotide supplementation reduced (P < 0.05) jejunal IL-6 (at 50 and 150 mg/kg) and tended to change (quadratic, P = 0.074) plasma MDA (at 231 mg/kg). Nucleotide supplementation at 50 and 150 mg/kg increased (P < 0.05) ileal digestibility of energy and ether extract. In conclusion, nucleotide supplementation at a range of 50 to 250 mg/kg in the diets seems to be beneficial to newly weaned pigs by enhancing growth performance possibly due to reduced intestinal  and oxidative stress as well as improved intestinal villi structure and energy digestibility.© The Author(s) 2019.

It remains unclear whether acute nighttime train exposure may induce subclinical atherosclerosis, such as endothelial dysfunction and other functional and/or biochemical changes. Thus, we aimed to expose healthy subjects to nocturnal train noise and to assess endothelial function, changes in plasma protein levels and clinical parameters. In a randomized crossover study, we exposed 70 healthy volunteers to either background or two different simulated train noise scenarios in their homes during three nights. After each night, participants visited the study center for measurement of vascular function and assessment of other biomedical and biochemical parameters. The three nighttime noise scenarios were exposure to either background noise (control), 30 or 60 train noise events (Noise30 or Noise60), with average sound pressure levels of 33, 52 and 54 dB(A), respectively. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery was 11.23 ± 4.68% for control, compared to 8.71 ± 3.83% for Noise30 and 8.47 ± 3.73% for Noise60 (p < 0.001 vs. control). Sleep quality was impaired after both Noise30 and Noise60 nights (p < 0.001 vs. control). Targeted proteomic analysis showed substantial changes of plasma proteins after the Noise60 night, mainly centered on redox, pro-thrombotic and proinflammatory pathways. Exposure to simulated nocturnal train noise impaired endothelial function. The proteomic changes point toward a proinflammatory and pro-thrombotic phenotype in response to nocturnal train noise and provide a molecular basis to explain the increased cardiovascular risk observed in epidemiological noise studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659629>IL-1 promotes α-epithelial Sodium Channel (α-ENaC) expression in murine lung epithelial cells: involvement of NF-κB.</a></h2><p>Intra-amniotic exposure to proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) correlates with a decreased incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in infants following premature birth. At birth, inadequate absorption of fluid from the fetal lung contributes to the onset RDS. Lung fluid clearance is coupled to Na transport via epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). In this study, we assessed the effects of IL-1 on the expression of ENaC, particularly the α-subunit which is critical for fetal lung fluid clearance at birth. Cultured mouse lung epithelial (MLE-12) cells were treated with either IL-1α or IL-1β to determine their effects on α-ENaC expression. Changes in IL-1-induced α-ENaC levels in the presence of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), cycloheximide, NF-κB inhibitor, and MAP kinase inhibitors were investigated. IL-1α and IL-1β independently induced a significant increase of α-ENaC mRNA and protein after 24 h compared to untreated cells. IL-1-dependent increases in α-ENaC protein were mitigated by IL-1ra and cycloheximide. IL-1 exposure induced NF-κB binding activity. Attenuation of IL-1-induced NF-κB activation by its inhibitor SN50 decreased α-ENaC protein abundance. Inhibition of ERK 1,2 MAPK significantly decreased both IL-1α and β-induced α-ENaC protein expression whereas inhibition of p38 MAPK only blocked IL-1β-induced α-ENaC protein levels. In contrast, IL-1-induced α-ENaC protein levels were unaffected by a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor. Our results suggest that in MLE-12 cells, IL-1-induced elevation of α-ENaC is mediated via NF-κB activation and in part involves stimulation of the ERK 1,2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665675>Combination of curcumin and luteolin synergistically inhibits TNF-α-induced vascular  in human vascular cells and mice.</a></h2><p>Emerging evidence shows that phytochemicals, the secondary plant metabolites present in a large variety of foods, have the potential ability in reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. However, the dosages of phytochemicals in the cellular and animal studies are too high to reach in humans by relevant foods or dietary supplement intake. The aims of this study were to investigate whether and how combined curcumin and luteolin synergistically inhibit tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced monocytes adhesion endothelium, a crucial step of the development of endothelial dysfunction, both in human vascular cells and mouse aortic endothelium. Our results show that combined curcumin (1 μM) and luteolin (0.5 μM) synergistically (combination index is 0.60) inhibited TNF-α-induced monocytes adhesion to human EA.hy926 endothelial cells while the individual chemicals did not have such effect at the selected concentrations. We also found that TNF-α-enhanced protein expressions of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB translocation were synergistically reduced by the combined curcumin and luteolin in EA.hy 926 cells while the individual chemical did not have this inhibitory effect. Consistently, 2 weeks dietary intake of combined curcumin (500 mg/kg) and luteolin (500 mg/kg) in C57BL/6 mice synergistically prevented TNF-α-stimulated adhesion of mouse monocytes to aortic endothelium ex vivo as well as the TNF-α-increased aortic protein expression of MCP-1 and VCAM-1. Therefore, combined curcumin and luteolin at physiological concentrations synergistically inhibits TNF-α-induced monocytes adhesion to endothelial cells and expressions of MCP-1 and VCAM-1 via suppressing NF-κB translocation into the nucleus.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the (pre-analytical, analytical and clinical) performance of serum calprotectin as a marker of  in RA. Methods The study population included 463 rheumatologic patients (including 111 RA patients and 352 controls) who for the first time consulted a rheumatologist, 20 healthy controls and 27 patients with an infectious disease. Calprotectin was measured (using four different assays) in serum or in serum and EDTA plasma (healthy controls and infectious disease group). For rheumatologic patients, results for C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) were available. Results Results for blood calprotectin were assay- and matrix-dependent, with higher values found in serum than in plasma. Serum calprotectin was higher in RA patients than in rheumatologic diseased controls and in healthy controls. Serum calprotectin was lower in RA patients than in patients with an infectious disease. Serum calprotectin was associated with disease activity (DAS score). The area under the curve (AUC) to discriminate RA from controls was 0.756 for CRP, 0.714 for ESR and 0.726-0.783 for calprotectin. Conclusions Our data document that calprotectin measurement is assay- and matrix-dependent. Serum calprotectin is associated with disease activity. Additional (prospective) studies are warranted to further evaluate the prognostic and diagnostic value of blood calprotectin measurements.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659946>Antineuroinflammatory therapy: potential treatment for autism spectrum disorder by inhibiting glial activation and restoring synaptic function.</a></h2><p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by deficits in social interactions and perseverative and stereotypical behavior. Growing evidence points toward a critical role for synaptic dysfunction in the onset of ASD, and synaptic function is influenced by glial cells. Considering the evidence that neuroinflammation in ASD is mediated by glial cells, one hypothesis is that reactive glial cells, under inflammatory conditions, contribute to the loss of synaptic functions and trigger ASD. Ongoing pharmacological treatments for ASD, including oxytocin, vitamin D, sulforaphane, and resveratrol, are promising and are shown to lead to improvements in behavioral performance in ASD. More importantly, their pharmacological mechanisms are closely related to anti- and synaptic protection. We focus this review on the hypothesis that synaptic dysfunction caused by reactive glial cells would lead to ASD, and discuss the potentials of antineuroinflammatory therapy for ASD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663199>Lipopolysaccharide and tumor necrosis factor-alpha alter gene expression of oocytes and cumulus cells during bovine in vitro maturation.</a></h2><p>Communication between the oocyte and cumulus facilitates oocyte growth, cell cycle regulation, and metabolism. This communication is mediated by direct contact between oocytes and cumulus cells, and soluble secreted molecules. Secreted molecules involved in this process are known inflammatory mediators. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is detected in follicular fluid and is associated with reduced fertility, whereas accumulation of inflammatory mediators in follicular fluid, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), is associated with female infertility. Maturation of oocytes in the presence of LPS or TNF-α reduces meiotic maturation and the capacity to develop to the blastocyst. Here we evaluated the abundance of 92 candidate genes involved immune function, epigenetic modifications, embryo development, oocyte secreted factors, apoptosis, cell cycle, and cell signaling in bovine cumulus cells or zona-free oocytes after exposure to LPS or TNF-α during in vitro maturation. We hypothesize that LPS or TNF-α will alter the abundance of transcripts in oocytes and cumulus cell in a cell type dependent manner. Exposure to LPS altered abundance of 31 transcripts in oocytes (including ACVR1V, BMP15, DNMT3A) and 12 transcripts in cumulus cells (including AREG, FGF4, PIK3IP1). Exposure to TNF-α altered 1 transcript in oocytes (IGF2) and 4 transcripts in cumulus cells (GJA1, PLD2, PTGER4, STAT1). Cumulus expansion was reduced after exposure to LPS or TNF-α. Exposing COCs to LPS had a marked effect on expression of targeted transcripts in oocytes. We propose that altered oocyte transcript abundance is associated with reduced meiotic maturation and embryo development observed in oocytes cultured in LPS or TNF-α.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664621>Perioperative Blood Transfusion is Associated with Postoperative Systemic Inflammatory Response and Poorer Outcomes Following Surgery for Colorectal Cancer.</a></h2><p>The present study investigated relationships between perioperative blood transfusion, postoperative systemic inflammatory response, and outcomes following surgery for colorectal cancer.Data were recorded for patients (n = 544) undergoing potentially curative, elective surgery for colorectal cancer at a single center between 2012 and 2017. Transfusion history was obtained retrospectively from electronic records. Associations between blood transfusion, postoperative C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, hemoglobin, complications, cancer-specific survival and overall survival (OS) were assessed using propensity score matching (n =116).Of 544 patients, the majority were male (n =294, 54%), over 65 years of age (n =350, 64%), and with colonic (n =347, 64%) node-negative disease (n =353, 65%). Eighty-six patients (16%) required perioperative blood transfusion.

We have previously shown distinct prevalence of adipose tissue replacement in the minor salivary gland tissue from pSS patients. The salivary gland microenvironment was further examined through microarray analysis, identifying signalling pathways that promoted adipose tissue development, , and lymphoma. As B cells may also contribute to disease progression, we now aimed to study the B cell pattern with regard to adipocyte development in pSS. Double immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded salivary gland tissue from 22 pSS patients and 11 non-SS tissue controls was employed, using the characteristic pSS autoantigens Ro52 or Ro60, alongside CD27. Additional CD138/CD20 double staining was also performed to identify the plasma- and general B- cell pattern. Our results demonstrated CD27-positive Ro52 and Ro60 specific cells observed within and in close proximity to the adipose tissue. CD138-positive plasma cells were also seen in areas of adipose tissue replacement, while the CD20 cells were located within focal infiltrates, forming distinct B cell zones. The quantification of CD138 and CD20 cells revealed elevated numbers of CD138 cells in areas of fatty infiltration, and also interstitially, in the salivary glands of pSS patients when compared to non-SS controls. A significant increase ( < .01) in CD138 cells close to areas of fatty infiltration, and interstitially, with increasing fatty infiltration and focus score was further observed in pSS patients. A correlation between the number of CD20 B cell zones/mm of salivary gland tissue and focus score values was also witnessed in the patients ( = 0.6047,  < .001). In conclusion, autoantigen-specific B cells and plasma cells appear prominent in areas of fatty infiltration in salivary glands of pSS patients, where an increase in CD138 plasma cells and CD20 B cells, in relation to both fatty and focal infiltration, suggests their active involvement in promoting .

Disruption of function or frequency of either cell type can lead to fatal autoimmunity. We previously described that mice constitutively lacking DCs (∆DC) develop autoimmunity characterized by reduced body weight, autoantibodies, and pronounced intestinal . In this study, we show that lack of DCs leads to an altered gene expression profile in peripheral but not thymic Tregs with increased expression of inhibitory receptors. The suppressive function of Tregs from ΔDC mice was impaired in T cell cocultures. In a model of transfer colitis, Tregs from ∆DC mice were only functional in the presence of DCs in recipient mice. Lack of MHC class II on DCs also resulted in upregulation of inhibitory receptors on Tregs, reduced body weight, and elevated serum IgA levels. Further analysis of the IgA response revealed an expansion of IgA germinal center B cells and plasma cells in mesenteric lymph nodes and more IgA-coated commensal bacteria in feces of ∆DC mice.

Furthermore, Granulocyte-Macrophage-Colony-Stimulating-Factor (GM-CSF) induced by both TNF and thrombin is a critical intermediate, necessary and sufficient for weakening by either agent. The amnion is the strength component of FM and must weaken for FM to rupture. It is unclear whether GM-CSF weakens amnion (AM) directly, or initially targets choriodecidua (CD) which secondarily releases agents to act on amnion.Full thickness FM fragments were treated with/without GM-CSF. Some were preincubated with alpha-lipoic acid (LA), a known inhibitor of FM weakening. The FM fragments were then strength-tested. Separately, FM fragments were initially separated to AM and CD. AM fragments were cultured with Medium ± GM-CSF and then strength-tested. In other experiments, CD fragments were cultured with Medium, GM-CSF, LA, or LA + GM-CSF. Conditioned medium from each group was then incubated with AM. AM was then strength-tested. Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) and Tissue Inhibitors of Matrix Metalloproteinases (TIMPs) were analyzed by Mutiplex Elisa.GM-CSF weakened intact FM which was blocked by LA. GM-CSF did not weaken isolated AM. However, GM-CSF conditioned CD media weakened AM and this weakening was inhibited by LA. GM-CSF treatment of CD increased MMPs 2, 9, and 10, and decreased TIMPs 1-3. LA reversed these effects.GM-CSF does not weaken amnion directly; GM-CSF acts on CD to increase proteases and decrease anti-proteases which secondarily weaken the amnion.Copyright © 2019.

Positron emission tomography (PET) is a clinically available molecular imaging tool with significant potential to study pathogenesis of infections in humans. PET enables dynamic assessment of infectious processes within the same subject with high temporal and spatial resolution and obviates the need for invasive tissue sampling, which is difficult in patients and generally limited to a single time point, even in animal models. This review presents current state-of-the-art concepts on the application of molecular imaging for infectious diseases and details how PET imaging can facilitate novel insights into infectious processes, ongoing development of pathogen-specific imaging, and simultaneous  measurements of intralesional antimicrobial pharmacokinetics in multiple compartments, including privileged sites.

Pro-inflammatory cytokine, interferon (IFN)-γ, confers anti-tumor activity using several different mechanisms. Conversely, higher expression of interleukin (IL)-17 is associated with worse prognosis. Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 correlates positively with poor long-term survival of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. IL-1α affects cancer associated fibroblasts and macrophages, and promote several malignant phenotypes including immune suppression. Some anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, relate to pro-tumoral activities. Among immune checkpoint modulators, programmed death (PD-)1 and PD-ligand (L)1 facilitate oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell evasion from immune surveillance, and the expression status of these has a prognostic value. OSCCs contain tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) as major stromal cells of their tumor microenvironment. Among the two distinctive states, M2 macrophages support tumor invasion, metastasis and immune suppression. Crosstalk between TAMs and OSCC or cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) plays an important role in the progression of OSCC. Clinical trials with blocking antibodies against IL-1α or melanoma-associated antigens have been reported as therapeutic approaches against OSCCs. The most promising approach activating antitumor immunity is the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Manipulating the polarization of pro-tumorigenic macrophages has been reported as a novel therapeutic approach.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661364>Use of MRI to Measure Bronchial  in Cystic Fibrosis.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659758>Anlotinib attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis via the TGF-β1 signalling pathway.</a></h2><p>Anlotinib hydrochloride (AL3818) is a novel multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor which has the same targets as nintedanib, an effective drug has been approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we examined whether anlotinib could also attenuate bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice and explored the antifibrosis mechanism.We have evaluated the effect of anlotinib on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Inflammatory cytokines in alveolar lavage fluid including IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6 and TNF-α were determined by ELISA. Biomarkers of oxidative stress were measured by corresponding kit. Histopathologic examination was analysed by H&E staining and immunohistochemistry. In vitro, we investigated whether anlotinib inhibited TGFβ/Smad3 and non-Smad pathways by luciferase assay or Western blotting. We also evaluated whether anlotinib inhibited TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and promoted myofibroblast apoptosis in order to explore the possible molecular mechanism.The results indicated that anlotinib treatment remarkably attenuated , oxidative stress and pulmonary fibrosis in mouse lungs. Anlotinib could inhibit the TGF-β1 signalling pathway. Additionally, anlotinib not only profoundly inhibited TGF-β1-induced EMT in alveolar epithelial cells, but also simultaneously reduced the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis in fibroblasts.In summary, the results suggest that anlotinib-mediated suppression of pulmonary fibrosis is related to the inhibition of TGF-β1 signalling pathway.© 2019 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661774>Eleutheroside B Protects against Acute Kidney Injury by Activating IGF Pathway.</a></h2><p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common, complex, and severe clinical syndrome characterized by rapid decline in renal function, combined with tissue damage. Currently, the prevention and treatment of AKI are focused on symptomatic treatment, rather than treating the underlying causes. Therefore, there is no specific treatment to prevent renal injury except for renal dialysis. In this study, we used cisplatin-induced AKI mouse and human kidney-2 (HK-2) cell models to evaluate the renal protective effect of eleutheroside B, an active compound in traditional Chinese medicines. MTT assay was used to detect the effect of eleutheroside B on proliferation of human HK-2 cells in presence and in absence of cisplatin. Western blot and immunostaining were used to detect the protein level of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), cleaved caspase-3, receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK)-1, and RIPK-3. Real-time PCR was used to detect the mRNA levels of chemokines (like monocyte chemotactic protein 1, MCP-1) and pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α). Flow cytometry assay was used to detect apoptosis of HK-2 cells. In vivo results showed that eleutheroside B reduced the increase in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels in the AKI model. Periodic acid-Schiff staining and Western blot analysis of KIM-1 showed that eleutheroside B alleviated tubular cell injury. Further, eleutheroside B reduced macrophage infiltration and production of inflammatory cytokines, inhibited the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, and inhibited apoptosis and programmed necrosis. The mechanism may be that eleutheroside B can activate the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway and its downstream pathway by downregulating the expression of IGFBP-7, thus promoting cell proliferation. Therefore, our results suggest that eleutheroside B is a potential drug for AKI treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661990>The evolution in our understanding of the genetics of rheumatoid arthritis and the impact on novel drug discovery.</a></h2><p>: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by chronic  of the joints and affects 1% of the population. Polymorphisms of genes that encode proteins that primarily participate in  may influence RA occurrence or become useful biomarkers for certain types of anti-rheumatic treatment.: The authors summarize the recent progress in our understanding of the genetics of RA. In the last few years, multiple variants of genes that are associated with RA risk have been identified. The development of new technologies and the detection of new potential therapeutic targets that contribute to novel drug discovery are also described.: There is still the need to search for new genes which may be a potential target for RA therapy. The challenge is to develop appropriate strategies for achieving insight into the molecular pathways involved in RA pathogenesis. Understanding the genetics, immunogenetics, epigenetics and immunology of RA could help to identify new targets for RA therapy. The development of new technologies has enabled the detection of a number of new genes, particularly genes associated with proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, B- and T-cell activation pathways, signal transducers and transcriptional activators, which might be potential therapeutic targets in RA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664154>Osteopontin Expression in Small Airway Epithelium in Copd is Dependent on Differentiation and Confined to Subsets of Cells.</a></h2><p>Osteopontin (OPN) plays a role in  via recruitment of neutrophils and tissue remodeling. In this study, we investigated the distribution of OPN-expressing cells in the airway epithelium of normal lung tissue and that from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). OPN was detected on the epithelial cell surface of small airways and in scattered cells within the epithelial cell layer. Staining revealed higher OPN concentrations in tissue showing moderate to severe COPD compared to that in controls. In addition, OPN expression was confined to goblet and club cells, and was absent from ciliated and basal cells as detected via immunohistochemistry. However, OPN expression was up-regulated in submerged basal cells cultures exposed to cigarette smoke (CS) extract. Cell fractioning of air-liquid interface cultures revealed increased OPN production from basal compartment cells compared to that in luminal fraction cells. Furthermore, both constitutive and CS-induced expression of OPN decreased during differentiation. In contrast, cultures stimulated with interleukin (IL)-13 to promote goblet cell hyperplasia showed increased OPN production in response to CS exposure. These results indicate that the cellular composition of the airway epithelium plays an important role in OPN expression and that these levels may reflect disease endotypes in COPD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658493>Angiotensin-(1-7) Mitigated Angiotensin II-induced Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms in Apolipoprotein E Knockout Mice.</a></h2><p>To test the hypothesis that angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] treatment may attenuate abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) via inhibiting vascular , extracellular matrix degradation and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) apoptosis, an animal model of AAA was established by angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion to apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE ) mice.All mice and cultured SMCs or macrophages were divided into control, Ang II-treated, Ang II + Ang-(1-7)-treated, Ang II + Ang-(1-7) + A779-treated and Ang II + Ang-(1-7) + PD123319-treated groups, respectively.In the in vivo experiment, Ang-(1-7) treatment reduced the incidence and severity of AAA induced by Ang II infusion, and the mechanisms involved inhibited macrophage infiltration, attenuated expression of interleukin 6(IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1(MCP-1) and matrix metalloprotease 2(MMP2), as well as abated SMCs apoptosis in the abdominal aortic tissues. However, the addition of A779 or PD123319 treatment in these mice reversed Ang-(1-7)-mediated beneficial effects on AAA. In the in vitro experiment, Ang-(1-7) treatment mitigated the mRNA expression of IL-6, TNF-α and MCP-1 induced by Ang II stimulation in macrophages. In addition, Ang-(1-7) treatment significantly suppressed apoptosis and MMP2 expression and activity in Ang II-treated SMCs. The molecular mechanism may involve inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathways via Ang-(1-7) stimulation of Mas and angiotensin II type 2 receptors.Ang-(1-7) treatment attenuated Ang II-induced AAA via inhibiting vascular , extracellular matrix degradation and SMCs apoptosis. Ang-(1-7) may provide a novel and promising approach to the prevention and treatment of AAA.This article is protected by copyright.

RA-associated ILD (RA-ILD) exists on a wide spectrum, with variable levels of inflammatory and fibrotic activity, although all subtypes are regarded as irreversible pathologic conditions. In both articular and pulmonary manifestations, TNF is a significant pathogenic factor. Whereas anti-TNF therapy alleviates joint pathologic conditions, it exacerbates fibrotic RA-ILD. The TNF-transgenic (TNF-Tg) murine model of RA develops both inflammatory arthritis and an ILD that mimics a cellular nonspecific interstitial pneumonia pattern dominated by an interstitial accumulation of inflammatory cells with minimal-to-absent fibrosis. Given the model's potential to elucidate the genesis of inflammatory RA-ILD, we aim to achieve the following: 1) characterize the cellular accumulations in TNF-Tg lungs, and 2) assess the reversibility of inflammatory ILD following anti-TNF therapy known to resolve TNF-Tg inflammatory arthritis. TNF-Tg mice with established disease were randomized to anti-TNF or placebo therapy and evaluated with imaging, histology, and flow cytometric analyses, together with wild-type controls. Flow cytometry of TNF-Tg versus wild-type lungs revealed significant increases in activated monocytes, conventional dendritic cells, and CD21/CD23 B cells that are phenotypically distinct from the B cells in inflamed nodes, which are known to accumulate in joint-draining lymph nodes. In contrast to human RA-ILD, anti-TNF treatment significantly alleviated both joint and lung . These results identify a potential role for activated monocytes, conventional dendritic cells, and CD21/CD23 B cells in the genesis of RA-ILD, which exist in a previously unknown, reversible, prefibrotic stage of the disease.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660534>A systematic review of guidelines for managing rheumatoid arthritis.</a></h2><p>We systematically reviewed current guidelines for managing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to evaluate their range and nature, assess variations in their recommendations and highlight divergence in their perspectives.We searched Medline and Embase databases using the terms 'clinical practice guidelines' and 'rheumatoid arthritis' from January 2000 to January 2017 together with publications of national and international bodies. We included guidelines providing recommendations on general RA management spanning a range of treatments and published in English. We undertook narrative assessments due to the heterogeneity of the guidelines.We identified 529 articles; 22 met our inclusion criteria. They were primarily developed by rheumatologists with variable involvement of patient and other experts. Three dealt with early RA, one established RA and 18 all patients. Most guidelines recommend regular assessments based on the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology core dataset; 18 recommended the disease activity score for 28 joints. Twenty recommended targeting remission; 16 suggested low disease activity as alternative. All guidelines recommend treating active RA; 13 made recommendations for moderate disease. The 21 guidelines considering early RA all recommended starting disease modifying drugs (DMARDs) as soon as possible; methotrexate was recommended for most patients. Nineteen recommended combination DMARDs when patients failed to respond fully to monotherapy and biologics were not necessarily indicated. Twenty made recommendations about biologics invariably suggesting their use after failing conventional DMARDs, particularly methotrexate. Most did not make specific recommendations about using one class of biologics preferentially. Eight recommended tapering biologics when patients achieved sustained good responses.Five general principles transcend most guidelines: DMARDs should be started as soon as possible after the diagnosis; methotrexate is the best initial treatment; disease activity should be regularly monitored; give biologics to patients with persistently active disease who have already received methotrexate; remission or low disease activity are the preferred treatment target.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658732>Efficacy of Cell-Based Therapies for Traumatic Brain Injuries.</a></h2><p>Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are a leading cause of death and disability. Additionally, growing evidence suggests a link between TBI-induced neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative disorders. Treatments for TBI patients are limited, largely focused on rehabilitation therapy, and ultimately, fail to provide long-term neuroprotective or neurorestorative benefits. Because of the prevalence of TBI and lack of viable treatments, new therapies are needed which can promote neurological recovery. Cell-based treatments are a promising avenue because of their potential to provide multiple therapeutic benefits. Cell-based therapies can promote neuroprotection via modulation of  and promote neurorestoration via induction of angiogenesis and neurogenesis. Neural stem/progenitor cell transplantations have been investigated in preclinical TBI models for their ability to directly contribute to neuroregeneration, form neural-like cells, and improve recovery. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been investigated in clinical trials through multiple different routes of administration. Intravenous administration of MSCs appears most promising, demonstrating a robust safety profile, correlation with neurological improvements, and reductions in systemic  following TBI.

Secreted factors, intercellular transfer of mitochondria and the receptor-ligand interactions have been shown as mediators of this protection. Here we report that tunneling nanotubes (TNTs)-long, thin membranous structures, which have been identified as a novel mode of intercellular cross-talk-are formed in the presence of stroma and mediate transfer of cellular vesicles from stroma to leukemic cells. Importantly, transmission of vesicles via TNTs from stromal cells increases resistance of leukemic cells to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib. Using correlative light-electron microscopy and electron tomography we show that stromal TNTs contain vesicles, provide membrane continuity with the cell bodies and can be open-ended. Moreover, trans-SILAC studies to reveal the non-autonomous proteome showed that specific sets of proteins are transferred together with cellular vesicles from stromal to leukemic cells, with a potential role in survival and adaptation. Altogether, our findings provide evidence for the biological role of the TNT-mediated vesicle exchange between stromal and leukemic cells, implicating the direct vesicle and protein transfer in the stroma-provided protection of leukemic cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665288>Safety of Combination Biologic and Antirejection Therapy Post-Liver Transplantation in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) post-liver transplant (LT) may have bowel  requiring biologic therapy. We aimed to evaluate the safety of combination biologic and antirejection therapy in IBD patients after LT from a tertiary center case series and an updated literature review.Inflammatory bowel disease patients undergoing LT between 1985 and 2018 and requiring combination biologic and antirejection therapy post-LT were identified from the London Health Sciences Transplant Registry (Ontario, Canada). Safety outcomes were extracted by medical chart review. For an updated literature review, EMBASE, Medline, and CENTRAL were searched to identify studies evaluating the safety of combination biologic and antirejection therapy in IBD patients.In the case series, 19 patients were identified. Most underwent LT for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC; 14/19, 74%) treated with anti-integrins (8/19, 42%) or tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) antagonists (6/19, 32%). Infections occurred in 11/19 (58%) patients, most commonly Clostridium difficile (4/19, 21%). Two patients required colectomy, and 1 patient required re-transplantation. In the literature review, 13 case series and 8 case reports reporting outcomes for 122 IBD patients treated with biologic and antirejection therapy post-LT were included. PSC was the indication for LT in 97/122 (80%) patients, and 91/122 (75%) patients were treated with TNF antagonists. Infections occurred in 32/122 (26%) patients, primarily Clostridium difficile (7/122, 6%).Inflammatory bowel disease patients receiving combination biologic and antirejection therapy post-LT appeared to be at increased risk of Clostridium difficile. Compared with the general liver transplant population in the published literature, there was no increased risk of serious infection.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) is an inhibitor of CD38. This study investigated the pathogenic role of CD38+ NK cells and the effect of C3G on RA.Rats with bovine type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were injected with C3G. RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) or mononuclear cells (MNCs) were cultured with C3G. MNCs were also cocultured with CD38+ NK cells following C3G pretreatment.C3G injection significantly alleviated CIA. C3G also significantly increased the level of interleukin (IL)-10 and the regulatory T (Treg) cell proportion, and it decreased the interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon (IFN)-γ levels and CD38+ NK cell proportion in rat peripheral blood and synovial fluid. Additionally, C3G significantly increased RASF apoptosis and decreased RASF proliferation and IL-6 production in the culture medium. Furthermore, C3G stimulated MNCs to increase IL-2 and IL-10 production and the Treg cell proportion, and it caused MNCs to decrease IL-6 and IFN-γ production and the CD38+ NK cell proportion. Although CD38+ NK cells significantly decreased the Treg cell proportion and IL-10 level in MNCs, CD38+ NK cells that had been pretreated with C3G increased the proportion of Treg cells and IL-10 levels and decreased the IL-6 and IFN-γ levels in the coculture. In CD38+ NK cells, C3G significantly increased Sirtuin 6 (Sirt6) expression and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α level, and it decreased natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) expression and the IFN-γ level. However, when CD38+ NK cells were treated with Sirt6 siRNA, C3G did not change the NKG2D expression, the TNF-α level sharply decreased, and the IFN-γ level increased. When MNCs were cocultured with C3G-pretreated CD38+ NK cells in the presence of TNF-α and an anti-IFN-γ antibody, the IL-10+ Treg cell proportion significantly increased. When MNCs were cocultured with C3G-pretreated CD38+ NK cells in the presence of IFN-γ and an anti-TNF-α antibody, the IL-10+ Treg cell proportion sharply decreased. When CIA rats were injected with both C3G and the Sirt6 inhibitor OSS_128167, the rats exhibited joint  and a low Treg cell proportion, but the CD38+ NK proportion was still low.C3G has therapeutic effects on CIA and RA. C3G decreased the proportion of CD38+ cells, RASF proliferation, and proinflammatory cytokine secretion, and it increased the Treg cell proportion. C3G also elevated Sirt6 expression to suppress NKG2D expression, increase TNF-α secretion, and decrease IFN-γ secretion in CD38+ NK cells, which stimulates MNCs to differentiate into Treg cells. This study also demonstrates that the inhibition of Treg cell differentiation in MNCs by CD38+ NK cells is a potential cause of the immune imbalance in RA and CIA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663148>15-LOX-1 has diverse roles in the resensitization of resistant cancer cell lines to doxorubicin.</a></h2><p>Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are a family of enzymes that can oxygenate polyunsaturated fatty acids. As a member of the family, 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) specifically metabolizes arachidonic acid and linoleic acid. 15-LOX-1 can affect physiological and pathophysiological events via regulation of the protein-lipid interactome, alterations in intracellular redox state and production of lipid metabolites that are involved in the induction and resolution of . Although several studies have shown that 15-LOX-1 has an antitumorigenic role in many different cancer models, including breast cancer, the role of the protein in cancer drug resistance has not been established yet. In this study, we, for the first time, aimed to show the potential role of 15-LOX-1 in acquired doxorubicin (DOX) resistance in MCF7 and HeLa cancer cell lines. Our results show that ALOX15 was transcriptionally downregulated in DOX-resistant cells compared with their drug-sensitive counterparts. Moreover, overexpression of ALOX15 in the drug-resistant cells resulted in resensitization of those cells to DOX in a cell-dependent manner. 15-LOX-1 expression could induce apoptosis by activating PPARγ and enhance the accumulation of DOX in drug-resistant MCF7 cells by altering cellular motility properties, and membrane dynamics. However, HeLa DOX cells did not show any of these effects but were susceptible to cell death when treated with 13(S)-HODE. These results underline the role and importance of 15-LOX-1 in cancer drug resistance, and points to novel mechanisms as a therapeutic approach to overcome cancer drug resistance.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658807>Foregut Diverticula.</a></h2><p>Diverticular disease can present anywhere along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

The present study aimed to investigate the possible protective effect of olmesartan (Olm), L-carnitine (L-CA) and their combination in cardiotoxicity induced by doxorubicin (DOX) in rats. Male albino rats were randomly divided into seven experimental groups (n=8): Group I: normal control, group II: L-CA, Group III: Olm, Group IV: DOX. The other three groups were treated with Olm (10 mg/kg), L-CA (300 mg/kg) and their combination for 2 weeks, after induction of cardiotoxicity by a single dose of DOX (20 mg/kg). In results, DOX showed a significant elevation in serum troponin I, CK-MB, and LDH, together with increased  manifested by the rise of TNF-α, ICAM-1, IL-1, MPO, NF-k β and TGF-β in cardiac tissues. While, DOX-induced oxidative stress by increasing in MDA and decreasing in SOD and GSH in heart tissues. In addition, caspase-3 activity was boosted as indication of increased apoptosis.

Pearson correlational coefficients were calculated between independent variables and outcome measures.Serum monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) level positively correlated with improvement on 2-mo satisfaction. Abnormal EMG finding of radiculopathy positively correlated with improvement in PDQ score at 1-mo. Epidural cytokine levels were not detectable in most samples, except for scattered marginally elevated levels in a few cytokines such as MCP-1, RANTES and IL-1b.This exploratory pilot study revealed that some biomarkers and EMG findings indicative of  and nerve root injury may be predictive of improvement following ESI in patients with LSS.

The accumulation of senescent cells is considered a hallmark of aging and thought to contribute to the aging pathologies. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates a myriad of cellular processes and has important roles in embryonic development, physiological tissue homeostasis, and various pathological conditions. TGF-β exerts potent growth inhibitory activities in various cell types, and multiple growth regulatory mechanisms have reportedly been linked to the phenotypes of cellular senescence and stem cell aging in previous studies. In addition, accumulated evidence has indicated a multifaceted association between TGF-β signaling and aging-associated disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, muscle atrophy, and obesity. The findings regarding these diseases suggest that the impairment of TGF-β signaling in certain cell types and the upregulation of TGF-β ligands contribute to cell degeneration, tissue fibrosis, , decreased regeneration capacity, and metabolic malfunction. While the biological roles of TGF-β depend highly on cell types and cellular contexts, aging-associated changes are an important additional context which warrants further investigation to better understand the involvement in various diseases and develop therapeutic options.

An autoimmune cause is suggested in a large proportion of noninfectious causes. Similar to other autoimmune diseases, the pathophysiology of aortitis has been investigated in detail, but the etiology remains unknown. Most cases of aortitis often go undetected for a long time and are often identified at late stages of the disease. Recent advances in imaging techniques have significantly improved the diagnosis of aortitis. However, significant challenges associated with the imaging techniques limit their use. Several routine -based markers, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and inflammatory cytokines, are nonspecific and, therefore, have limited use in the diagnosis of aortitis. The search for more specific serum biomarkers, which can facilitate detection and progression is under progress. Several autoantibodies have been identified, but assigning their role in the pathogenesis as well as their specificity remains a challenge. The current review addresses some of these issues in detail. KEY MESSAGES: • Noninfectious aortitis is an autoimmune disease. • Several biomarkers, including cytokines and autoantibodies, are increased in aortitis. • Imaging techniques, commonly used to detect aortitis, are associated with the high cost and technical challenges. • There is a need to develop low-cost biomarker-based detection tools. • The knowledge of biomarkers in aortitis detection is discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659729>Pulmonary Complications of Cystic Fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by the development of progressive bronchiectasis and impaired lung function with severe airflow obstruction.

Although all CF patients are at increased risk for pulmonary complications including hemoptysis, pneumothorax, pulmonary hypertension, and chronic hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure, the risk of developing these complications increases with progression of lung disease. The focus of this article is to summarize the pathophysiology, epidemiology, and management of these key pulmonary complications.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664319>Inflammatory Biomarkers and Carotid Thickness in HIV Infected Patients under Antiretroviral Therapy, Undetectable HIV-1 Viral Load, and Low Cardiovascular Risk.</a></h2><p>People living with HIV are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and carotid thickness, due to the  caused by the virus, the antiretroviral therapy, and other risk factors. However, few studies have observed the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases and carotid thickness in HIV-positive population at low cardiovascular risk and with undetectable viral load.To evaluate the association between levels of inflammatory markers and carotid thickness in people living with HIV, under antiretroviral therapy and at low cardiovascular risk.To determine low cardiovascular risk in both groups (HIV infected and non-infected individuals), the Framingham Risk Score was used. Inflammatory markers (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, sVCAM-1, and sICAM-1) were assessed using flow cytometry. Carotid thickness (mm) was measured using Doppler ultrasound. Level of significance was p < 0.05.In People living with HIV, age and smoking status were associated with carotid thickness alterations. In the non-HIV group, age, higher total cholesterol, and LDL levels were associated with increased carotid thickness. Using the multivariate analysis, a significant association between TNF-α and IL- 1( levels, and a higher chance of atherosclerosis development in HIV group were observed.Both groups have a similar risk for developing cardiovascular disease, therefore our study demonstrates that HIV-positive individuals with undetectable viral load in antiretroviral therapy without protease inhibitors and with low cardiovascular risk do not present differences in carotid thickness in relation to uninfected individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659503>Surgical management of growing teratoma syndrome: robotic-assisted thoracoscopic resection of mediastinal teratoma.</a></h2><p>Growing teratoma syndrome is a rare condition defined by the presence of enlarging metastatic lesions on serial imaging that arise after or during systemic chemotherapy for nonseminomatous germ cell tumors. Lesions commonly occur in the retroperitoneum, mediastinum, or lung and are notoriously unresponsive to conventional chemoradiotherapy.In this study, we present a dynamic case of a 26-year-old male, who had undergone surgical resection and systemic bleomycin treatment for a metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell tumor, and later developed recurrent masses in his posterior mediastinum seen on surveillance imaging. Tumor markers remained normal. These lesions were resected via a right robot-assisted thoracoscopic approach with the da Vinci Xi®.The operation was completed successfully with an unremarkable postoperative hospital course. The robotic-assisted right thoracoscopic approach allowed for a minimally invasive dissection with good visualization and minimal morbidity when compared to previous cases of surgically resected mediastinal teratomas. Final pathology demonstrated mature teratomatous elements within a setting of  and necrosis.Robot-assisted thoracoscopic management of metastatic mediastinal lesions in the setting of this rare condition is safe and feasible.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660355>Invasive Fungal Carotiditis: A Rare Manifestation of Cranial Invasive Fungal Disease: Case Series and Systematic Review of the Literature.</a></h2><p>Rhinosinusitis, malignant otitis externa, and skull base osteomyelitis represent a spectrum of cranial invasive fungal disease (IFD). These syndromes have distinct characteristics, yet they may progress to involve similar structures, resulting in  and invasion of the adjacent internal carotid artery (ICA). Invasive fungal carotiditis can have devastating consequences, including cerebral infarction, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and death.We retrospectively studied all patients diagnosed with cranial IFD and carotid involvement at our institution from 2003 to 2018. We also searched Medline/PubMed for reports of  or  cranial infections with ICA involvement. All cases with mycologic evidence of cranial IFD and radiographic or pathologic evidence of ICA involvement were included.We identified 78 cases of invasive fungal carotiditis between 1958 and 2018, including 4 cases at our own institution. Forty-one were caused by  and 37 by  species. Presenting symptoms included vision changes (73%), cranial nerve palsy (69%), and headache (42%). Carotid events included occlusion, aneurysm formation, and vessel rupture. Cerebral infarcts occurred in 50% of cases. Mortality at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 2 years was 27%, 41%, and 71% respectively. The median time from symptom onset to death was 150 days for cases due to  and 51 days for cases due to  species.Invasive fungal carotiditis is a rare but morbid manifestation of cranial IFD. Early suspicion of IFD and administration of antifungal treatment, vascular imaging, and endovascular interventions should be considered to reduce the high mortality of this disease.© The Author(s) 2019.

Interleukin 1β plays an important role in the destruction of periodontal tissues. Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) can inhibit the biological activity of IL-1β without triggering any intracellular signaling. This study aimed to prepare IL-1ra-loaded dextran/PLGA microspheres and evaluate the physical and chemical characteristics and anti-inflammatory properties.

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) has been established as an independent causal risk factor for CVD in the general population but has not been well established in the population of PHIV+.We cross-sectionally compared lipid profiles, including nonfasting Lp(a), together with total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides between 35 cART-treated PHIV+ children aged 8-18 years and 37 controls who were matched for age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. We explored associations between Lp(a) and disease- and treatment-related factors (, monocyte activation, and vascular), biomarkers, and neuroimaging outcomes using linear regression models.PHIV+ children had significantly higher levels of Lp(a) compared with controls (median, 43.6 [21.6-82.4] vs 21.8 [16.8-46.6] mg/dL;  = .033). Other lipid levels were comparable between groups. Additional assessment of apolipoprotein B, apolipoprotein CIII, apolipoprotein E, and  genotype revealed no significant differences. Higher Lp(a) levels were associated with higher plasma apoB levels and with lower monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and TG levels in PHIV+ children. Lp(a) was not associated with HIV- or cART-related variables or with neuroimaging outcomes.cART-treated PHIV+ children appear to have higher levels of Lp(a) compared with ethnicity-matched controls, which may implicate higher CVD risk in this population. Future research should focus on the association between Lp(a) and (sub)clinical CVD measurements in cART-treated PHIV+ patients.NRT4074.© The Author(s) 2019.

Beta-glucan or quercetin in a diet can alleviate colorectal cancer (CRC) by regulating the gut microbiota and related genes, but the effects of alternating their consumption for routine ingestion during CRC occurrence remain unknown. This study investigated the effects of alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin for routine ingestion on CRC development in mice. The mortality rate, colonic length, inflammatory cytokines, gut microbiota, and colonic epithelial gene expression in healthy and CRC mice that consumed normal and alternate diets were compared and studied. The results showed that alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin (alternating among a β-glucan diet, a normal diet and a normal diet that was supplemented with quercetin) alleviated colon damage and reduced the mortality rate in CRC mice, with a reduction in mortality of 12.5%. Alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin significantly decreased the TNF-α level, increased the relative abundance of  and downregulated three genes ( and ) that are associated with  and cancer. Alternating the consumption of some bioactive compounds, such as β-glucan and quercetin, in food can contribute to human health.

Various studies have shown that the perioperative use of gabapentin reduces postoperative pain. In our study, fragments of gingival tissue of healthy volunteers were collected during operation. Gene expression of 29 genes was investigated in gingival fibroblasts cell culture treated with gabapentin, compared with untreated cells. Of the different chemokines and interleukins studied, only 10 were statistically significant (CCL1, CCR1, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, ILI1A, ILI1B, IL5, IL6R, TNFSF10). The overexpression of these cytokines, obtained in many studies, leads us to think that gabapentin can interact and cause post-inflammatory gingival hyperplasia, but, probably, in our study the gabapentin has not the same effect, because we used gingival fibroblasts of healthy people.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664482>TAM-ing T cells in the tumor microenvironment: implications for TAM receptor targeting.</a></h2><p>The TAM receptors-TYRO3, AXL, MERTK-are pleiotropically expressed receptors in both healthy and diseased tissue. A complex of the ligands Protein S (PROS1) or Growth Arrest-Specific 6 (GAS6) with apoptotic phosphatidylserine activates the TAM receptors. Hence, this receptor family is essential for the efferocytosis of apoptotic material by antigen-presenting cells. In addition, TAM receptors are expressed by virtually all cells of the tumor microenvironment. They are also potent oncogenes, frequently overexpressed in cancer and involved in survival and therapy resistance. Due to their pro-oncogenic and immune-inhibitory traits, TAM receptors have emerged as promising targets for cancer therapy. Recently, TAM receptors have been described to function as costimulatory molecules on human T cells. TAM receptors' ambivalent functions on many different cell types therefore make therapeutic targeting not straight-forward. In this review we summarize our current knowledge of the function of TAM receptors in the tumor microenvironment. We place particular focus on TAM receptors and the recently unraveled role of MERTK in activated T cells and potential consequences for anti-tumor immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664045>Differential Treatments Based on Drug-induced Gene Expression Signatures and Longitudinal Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Stratification.</a></h2><p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous disease with unpredictable patterns of activity. Patients with similar activity levels may have different prognosis and molecular abnormalities. In this study, we aimed to measure the main differences in drug-induced gene expression signatures across SLE patients and to evaluate the potential for clinical data to build a machine learning classifier able to predict the SLE subset for individual patients. SLE transcriptomic data from two cohorts were compared with drug-induced gene signatures from the CLUE database to compute a connectivity score that reflects the capability of a drug to revert the patient signatures. Patient stratification based on drug connectivity scores revealed robust clusters of SLE patients identical to the clusters previously obtained through longitudinal gene expression data, implying that differential treatment depends on the cluster to which patients belongs. The best drug candidates found, mTOR inhibitors or those reducing oxidative stress, showed stronger cluster specificity. We report that drug patterns for reverting disease gene expression follow the cell-specificity of the disease clusters. We used 2 cohorts to train and test a logistic regression model that we employed to classify patients from 3 independent cohorts into the SLE subsets and provide a clinically useful model to predict subset assignment and drug efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661672>Elucidating the role of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) in metabolic PCOS models.</a></h2><p>PCOS is the most common endocrinopathy in women; associated with obesity and insulin resistance (IR). IR leads to accumulation of advanced-glycation-end-products (AGEs) and their receptor, RAGE. PCOS patients have increased levels of vascular-endothelial-growth-factor (VEGF), interleukin 6/8 (IL-6/8) and anti-Mϋllerian-hormone (AMH). PEDF is a secreted-glycoprotein known for its anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. We aimed to elucidate the role of PEDF in the pathogenesis and treatment of PCOS. We used a prenatal PCOS mouse model and fed the female offspring a high-fat-diet, inducing metabolic PCOS (met.PCOS) characteristics. Female offspring were divided into three groups: control; met.PCOS; met.PCOS+recombinant PEDF (rPEDF). Met.PCOS mice gained more weight, had elevated serum IL-6 and higher mRNA levels of AMH, PEDF and RAGE in their granulosa-cells (GCs) than met.PCOS+rPEDF mice. An in-vitro met.PCOS model in human GCs (KGN) line was induced by prolonged incubation with insulin/AGEs, causing development of IR. Under the same conditions, we observed an elevation of VEGF, IL-6/8 mRNAs, concomitantly with an increase in PEDF mRNA, intracellular protein levels, and an elevation of PEDF receptors (PEDF-Rs) mRNA and protein. Simultaneously, a reduction in the secretion of PEDF from GCs, was measured in the medium. The addition of rPEDF (5nM) activated P38 signaling, implying that PEDF-Rs maintained functionality, and negated AGE-induced elevation of IL-6/8 and VEGF mRNAs. Decreased PEDF secretion may be a major contributor to hyper-angiogenesis and chronic , which lie at the core of PCOS pathogenesis. rPEDF treatment may restore physiological angiogenesis-inflammatory balance, thus suggesting a potential therapeutic role in PCOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665825>A natural AKT inhibitor swertiamarin targets AKT-PH domain, inhibits downstream signaling and alleviates .</a></h2><p>Swertiamarin (SW), a representative component in Flos Lonicerae Japonicae, has been reported to exert significant activity in preventing infections. In this research, we aim to clarify the details of SW and its target to explore SW's underlying anti-inflammatory mechanisms. An azide labeled SW probe was synthesized for protein target fishing, and the results demonstrated that AKT could be captured specifically. Immunofluorescence co-localization with AKT was implemented by a click reaction of the SW probe and alkynyl CY5. The result showed that AKT was one of the targets of SW. Then, a competitive combination experiment using a set of AKT inhibitors and a membrane translocation experiment confirmed that SW might target the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of AKT. This specific binding directly deactivated the phosphorylation of AKT on both Ser473 and Thr308, which induced the dephosphorylation of IKK and NF-κB. Finally, proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8) were suppressed both in cells and acute lung injury animal model by targeting AKT-PH domain. This study demonstrated that SW functions as a natural AKT inhibitor and presents significant anti-inflammatory activity by directly regulating the AKT-PH domain and inhibiting downstream inflammatory molecules.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663501>Rhinogenic Orbital  - What Has Changed over the Past 50 Years?</a></h2><p>The purpose of the study was to compare the incidence, diagnostics, and treatment of rhinogenic inflammatory complications over the past 50 years.Retrospective study of 292 patients of ENT department, University hospital: Group A treated from 1966 to 1995, Group B treated from 1996 to 2015.Preseptal  was the most common type (73% vs. 74%), followed by subperiosteal abscess (21% vs. 20%). Surgery was indicated in 35% vs. 37% of the patients (p = 0.434). The most commonly used surgical approach was the external route (80%) in Group A and endoscopic endonasal surgery (60%) or a combination of endoscopic surgery of the paranasal sinuses and external orbitotomy (30%) in Group B (p < 0.001).

Studies have found that enhancement of autophagy, an intracellular catabolic process, may limit the pathologic progression of OA. Chloramphenicol is a potent activator of autophagy; however, the effects of chloramphenicol on articular cartilage are unknown.Using human OA knee chondrocytes in vitro, we asked, does chloramphenicol (1) activate autophagy in chondrocytes; (2) protect chondrocytes from IL-1β-induced apoptosis; and (3) reduce the expression of matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-13 and IL-6 (markers associated with articular cartilage degradation and joint ). Using an in vivo rabbit model of OA, we asked, does an intra-articular injection of chloramphenicol in the knee (4) induce autophagy; (5) reduce OA severity; and (6) reduce MMP-13 expression?Human chondrocytes were extracted from 10 men with OA undergoing TKA. After treatment with 25 μg/mL, 50 μg/mL, or 100μg/mL chloramphenicol, the autophagy of chondrocytes was detected with Western blotting, transmission electron microscopy, or an autophagy detection kit. There were four groups in our study: one group was untreated, one was treated with 100 μg/mL chloramphenicol, another was treated with 10 ng/mL of IL-1β, and the final group was treated with 10 ng/mL of IL-1β and 100 μg/mL of chloramphenicol. All groups were treated for 48 hours; cell apoptosis was detected with Western blotting and flow cytometry.  marker IL-6 in the cell culture supernatant was detected with an ELISA. Articular cartilage degradation-related enzyme MMP-13 was analyzed with Western blotting. A rabbit model of OA was induced by intra-articular injection of type II collagenase in 20 male 3-month-old New Zealand White rabbits' right hind leg knees; the left hind leg knees served as controls. Rabbits were treated by intra-articular injection of saline or chloramphenicol once a week for 8 weeks. Autophagy of the articular cartilage was detected with Western blotting and transmission electron microscopy. Degeneration of articular cartilage was analyzed with Safranin O-fast green staining and the semi-quantitative index Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) grading system. Degeneration of articular cartilage was evaluated using the OARSI grading system. The expression of MMP-13 in articular cartilage was detected with immunohistochemistry.Chloramphenicol activated autophagy in vitro in the chondrocytes of humans with OA and in an in vivo rabbit model of OA. Chloramphenicol inhibited IL-1-induced apoptosis (flow cytometry results with chloramphenicol, 25.33 ± 3.51%, and without chloramphenicol, 44.00 ± 3.61%, mean difference, 18.67% [95% CI 10.60 to 26.73]; p = 0.003) and the production of proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 (ELISA results, with chloramphenicol, 720.00 ± 96.44 pg/mL, without chloramphenicol, 966.67 ± 85.05 pg/mL; mean difference 74.24 pg/mL [95% CI 39.28 to 454.06]; p = 0.029) in chondrocytes. After chloramphenicol treatment, the severity of cartilage degradation was reduced in the treatment group (OARSI 6.80 ± 2.71) compared with the control group (12.30 ± 2.77), (mean difference 5.50 [95% CI 1.50 to 9.50]; p = 0.013). Furthermore, chloramphenicol treatment also decreased the production of MMP-13 in vitro and in vivo.Chloramphenicol reduced the severity of cartilage degradation in a type II collagen-induced rabbit model of OA, which may be related to induction of autophagy and inhibition of MMP-13 and IL-6.Our study suggests that an intra-articular injection of chloramphenicol may reduce degeneration of articular cartilage and that induction of autophagy may be a method for treating OA. The animal model we used was type II collagen-induced OA, which was different from idiopathic OA and post-traumatic OA. Therefore, we need to use other types of OA models (idiopathic OA or a surgically induced OA model) to further verify its effect, and the side effects of chloramphenicol also need to be considered, such as myelosuppression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660434>A Localized Chimeric Hydrogel Therapy Combats Tumor Progression through Alteration of Sphingolipid Metabolism.</a></h2><p>Rapid proliferation of cancer cells assisted by endothelial cell-mediated angiogenesis and acquired  at the tumor microenvironment (TME) lowers the success rate of chemotherapeutic regimens. Therefore, targeting these processes using localized delivery of a minimally toxic drug combination may be a promising strategy. Here, we present engineering of a biocompatible self-assembled lithocholic acid-dipeptide derived hydrogel (TRI-Gel) that can maintain sustained delivery of antiproliferating doxorubicin, antiangiogenic combretastatin-A4 and anti-inflammatory dexamethasone. Application of TRI-Gel therapy to a murine tumor model promotes enhanced apoptosis with a concurrent reduction in angiogenesis and , leading to effective abrogation of tumor proliferation and increased median survival with reduced drug resistance. In-depth RNA-sequencing analysis showed that TRI-Gel therapy induced transcriptome-wide alternative splicing of many genes responsible for oncogenic transformation including sphingolipid genes. We demonstrate that TRI-Gel therapy targets the reversal of a unique intron retention event in β-glucocerebrosidase 1 (), thereby increasing the availability of functional Gba1 protein. An enhanced Gba1 activity elevates ceramide levels responsible for apoptosis and decreases glucosylceramides to overcome drug resistance. Therefore, TRI-Gel therapy provides a unique system that affects the TME via post-transcriptional modulations of sphingolipid metabolic genes, thereby opening a new and rational approach to cancer therapy.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662579>Aspirin associated with decreased rate of intracranial aneurysm growth.</a></h2><p>Aspirin has emerged as a potential agent in the prevention of rupture of intracranial aneurysms (IAs). In this study, the authors' goal was to test if aspirin is protective against aneurysm growth in patients harboring multiple IAs ≤ 5 mm.The authors performed a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database covering the period July 2009 through January 2019. Patients' data were included if the following criteria were met: 1) the patient harbored multiple IAs; 2) designated primary aneurysms were treated by surgical/endovascular means; 3) the remaining aneurysms were observed for growth; and 4) a follow-up period of at least 5 years after the initial treatment was available. Demographics, earlier medical history, the rupture status of designated primary aneurysms, aneurysms' angiographic features, and treatment modalities were gathered.The authors identified 146 patients harboring a total of 375 IAs. At the initial encounter, 146 aneurysms were treated and the remaining 229 aneurysms (2-5 mm) were observed. During the follow-up period, 24 (10.48%) of 229 aneurysms grew. All aneurysms observed to grow later underwent treatment. None of the observed aneurysms ruptured. Multivariate analysis showed that aspirin was significantly associated with a decreased rate of growth (odds ratio [OR] 0.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.05-0.63). Variables associated with an increased rate of growth included hypertension (OR 14.38, 95% CI 3.83-53.94), drug abuse (OR 11.26, 95% CI 1.21-104.65), history of polycystic kidney disease (OR 9.48, 95% CI 1.51-59.35), and subarachnoid hemorrhage at presentation (OR 5.91, 95% CI 1.83-19.09).In patients with multiple IAs, aspirin significantly decreased the rate of aneurysm growth over time.

Inflammatory response or "joint flare" is a recognized potential side effect. However, the incidence and severity of  following IA HA injection in horses is not well documented. This study compared the effects of two IA HA formulations of different molecular weight (MW) and a saline control on clinical signs and synovial fluid markers of  in normal equine joints. Eight adult horses each had three healthy fetlock joints randomly assigned to treatment with either 1.4 mega Dalton HA, 0.8 mega Dalton HA or saline control once weekly for three weeks. Clinical evaluation and synovial fluid analysis were performed by blinded assessors. Outcomes of interest were lameness score, joint effusion score and synovial fluid white cell count and differential, total protein, viscosity and serum amyloid A. Joints injected with HA developed significant mild-to-moderate inflammatory responses often associated with lameness and joint effusion compared with saline control joints. The higher MW HA formulation elicited a significantly greater inflammatory response than the lower MW HA after the first injection. In HA injected joints, viscosity remained poor for the entire study. Both IA HA formulations in this study induced an inflammatory response in healthy equine joints. This may have implications for the use of HA in equine joints. The findings in this study are limited to the two HA formulations used. Further investigation of different HA formulations and the use of HA in normal and arthritic equine joints is warranted.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661299>Methods in Lung Microbiome Research.</a></h2><p>The lung microbiome is associated with host immune response and health outcomes in experimental models and patient cohorts.

However, they are not always effective against both gastric and duodenal lesions and their use is not devoid of side effects.To explore the mechanisms mediating the clinical efficacy of STW 5 in gastro-duodenal lesions induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), exemplified here by diclofenac, in a comparison to omeprazole.Gastro-duodenal lesions were induced in rats by oral administration of diclofenac (5 mg/kg) for 6 successive days. One group was given concurrently STW 5 (5 mL/kg) while another was given omeprazole (20 mg/kg). A day later, animals were sacrificed, stomach and duodenum excised and divided into 2 segments: One for histological examination and one for measuring inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor α, interleukins-1β and 10), oxidative stress enzyme (heme oxygenase-1) and apoptosis regulator (B-cell lymphoma 2).Diclofenac caused overt histological damage in both tissues, associated with parallel changes in all parameters measured. STW 5 and omeprazole effectively prevented these changes, but STW 5 superseded omeprazole in protecting against histological damage, particularly in the duodenum.The findings support the therapeutic usefulness of STW 5 and its superiority over omeprazole as adjuvant therapy to NSAIDs to protect against their possible gastro-duodenal side effects.©The Author(s) 2019.

This study aimed to investigate the potential role of lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 14 (SNHG14) in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced ALI.Expression of SNHG14, microRNA-34c-3p (miR-34c-3p) and Wnt1 inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1) in LPS-exposed mouse alveolar macrophages (MH-S) and lung tissues from mice with LPS-induced ALI was determined by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The interactions among SNHG14, miR-34c-3p and WISP1 were analyzed by dual-luciferase reporter and RIP assays. Using gain-of-function or loss-of-function approaches, the contents of proinflammatory proteins were determined and MH-S cell viability was assessed to evaluate the in vitro functions of SNHG14, miR-34c-3p and WISP1, and wet/dry weight ratio and proinflammatory proteins in lung tissues were determined to assess their in vivo effects.SNHG14 and WISP1 expression was increased, while miR-34c-3p was decreased in ALI models. SNHG14 bound to miR-34c-3p, resulting in impaired miR-34c-3p-dependent down-regulation of WISP1. Both SNHG14 silencing and miR-34c-3p over-expression reduced the levels of proinflammatory proteins IL-18, IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 and inhibited MH-S cell viability. SNHG14 silencing or miR-34c-3p over-expression decreased the wet/dry weight ratio in lung tissues from ALI mice. The reductions induced by SNHG14 silencing or miR-34c-3p over-expression were rescued by WISP1 over-expression.This study demonstrated that lncRNA SNHG14 silencing alleviated  in LPS-induced ALI through miR-34c-3p-mediated inhibition of WISP1. Our findings suggest that lncRNA SNHG14 may serve as a therapeutic target for ALI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664929>Inflammatory responses to a pathogenic West Nile virus strain.</a></h2><p>West Nile virus (WNV) circulates across Australia and was referred to historically as Kunjin virus (WNV). WNV has been considered more benign than other WNV strains circulating globally. In 2011, a more virulent form of the virus emerged during an outbreak of equine arboviral disease in Australia.To better understand the emergence of this virulent phenotype and the mechanism by which pathogenicity is manifested in its host, cells were infected with either the virulent strain (NSW2012), or less pathogenic historical isolates, and their innate immune responses compared by digital immune gene expression profiling. Two different cell systems were used: a neuroblastoma cell line (SK-N-SH cells) and neuronal cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).Significant innate immune gene induction was observed in both systems. The NSW2012 isolate induced higher gene expression of two genes (IL-8 and CCL2) when compared with cells infected with less pathogenic isolates. Pathway analysis of induced -associated genes also indicated generally higher activation in infected NSW2012 cells. However, this differential response was not paralleled in the neuronal cultures.NSW2012 may have unique genetic characteristics which contributed to the outbreak. The data herein is consistent with the possibility that the virulence of NSW2012 is underpinned by increased induction of inflammatory genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661887>Pyrogallol-Phloroglucinol-6,6-Bieckol Alleviates Obesity and Systemic  in a Mouse Model by Reducing Expression of RAGE and RAGE Ligands.</a></h2><p> () can alleviate diet-induced obesity in animal models, and phlorotannins contained in  help prevent hypertrophy-induced adipocyte differentiation.

It usually occurs as a terminal component at the non-reducing end of carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids. SA participates in multiple physiological functions, such as cell-to-cell interactions, cell migration and proliferation. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by rise in blood glucose level. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the periodontal tissue, leading to destruction of bone surrounding the tooth and ultimately tooth loss. There is a two way relationship between diabetes mellitus and periodontitis. Periodontitis is the sixth complication of diabetes along with retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, macrovascular disease, and altered wound healing. Inflammatory mediators like interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha produced during periodontal  can interfere with the actions of insulin receptors and worsen the glycemic control of diabetic patients. Periodontitis is a major cause of tooth loss, affecting over 300 million people and bacteria associated with periodontitis are also linked with systemic problems like endocarditis, atherosclerosis. Recent work has highlighted a major role for the host sugar sialic acid in the biofilm physiology and host-pathogen interactions of T. forsithya, a key periodontal pathogen. There exists a need for a biomarker, for early detection of disease evolution and more robust therapy efficacy measurements. Serum sialic acids were estimated in Indian population by diphenylamine method and Thiobarbituric acid method. The average values were 68 ± 2.6 mg percent by DPA method and 56 ± 5 mg percent by TBA (thiobarbituric acid assay) method. Age and sex showed no influence on serum sialic acid level. Objectives of the present study was to compare (TSSA) level in healthy subjects, subjects with (CMP) with and without (NIDDM) and its effect on non-surgical periodontal therapy. In the present study, the participants were divided into three groups: Group A, B and C. Group A consists of systemically healthy subjects, Group B consists of subjects with (CMP) while Group C consists of subjects with (CMP) with (NIDDM) and results of this study indicated that, at baseline, there were significant differences between Group A, B and Group C with respect to all the clinical parameters, including (GI), (OHI-S), (PPD), (CAL), (TSSA) and (HbA1c) levels. Thus (TSSA) level could be considered as novel biomarker in the progression of periodontal disease and diabetic status. Periodontitis could be considered as a potential, modifiable, and independent risk factor for the development of diabetes. Early detection of elevated (TSSA) level may help in interpreting the progression of periodontitis, risk of development of diabetes mellitus in future and also to prevent complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661475>[Proinflammatory Cytokines and Skin Wound Healing in Mice].</a></h2><p>Skin wound healing is subject to an intricate regulation, involves many cell populations and molecular mediators, and is one of the key mechanisms that ensures the barrier functions of the skin and the maintenance of body homeostasis. The efficiency of this process is largely determined by the balance of proinflammatory and proregenerative signals, which are mediated by cytokines. The review summarizes the latest data on the role of proinflammatory cytokines, mainly tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and interferons (IFNs), in skin wound healing, including those obtained with the use of genome editing techniques and methods of reverse genetics to establish relevant animal models. The roles that proinflammatory cytokines play at various stages of skin regeneration are discussed for both normal state and systemic pathologies, such as diabetes.

These measures were equivalent to those obtained after 6 days of daily dosing by tofacitinib. However, PET measures at trough plasma levels of the drug from tofacitinib administration were significantly higher than those at peak plasma drug levels and equivalent to pretreatment measures. There were insignificant changes in PET measures for the control animals. F-FDG PET can detect changes in inflammatory activity occurring in response to the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib: (a) during peak and trough plasma drug levels, that is within mere hours of treatment; and (b) over a span of days.© 2019 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661298>Hepatic IKK epsilon expression is dispensable for high-fat feeding-induced increases in liver lipid content and alterations in glucose tolerance.</a></h2><p>There are endocrine and immunological changes that occur during onset and progression of the overweight and obese states.

IRAK3 inhibits signalling cascades downstream of myddosome complexes associated with toll like receptors. IRAK3 contains a death domain that interacts with other IRAK family members, a pseudokinase domain and a C-terminus domain involved with tumour necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6). Previous bioinformatic studies revealed that IRAK3 contained a guanylate cyclase centre in its pseudokinase domain but its role in IRAK3 action is unresolved. We demonstrate that wildtype IRAK3 is capable of producing cGMP. Furthermore, we show that a specific point mutation in the guanylate cyclase centre reduced cGMP production. Cells containing toll like receptor 4 and a nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFĸB) reporter system were transfected with IRAK3 or mutant IRAK3 proteins. Cell-permeable cGMP treatment of untransfected control cells suppresses downstream signalling through modulation of the NFĸB in the presence of lipopolysaccharides. Cells transfected with wildtype IRAK3 also suppress lipopolysaccharide induced NFĸB activity in the absence of exogenous cGMP. Lipopolysaccharide induced NFĸB activity was not suppressed in cells transfected with the IRAK3 mutant with reduced cGMP-generating capacity. Whereas in the presence of exogenously applied cell-permeable cGMP the IRAK3 mutant was able to retain its function by suppressing lipopolysaccharide induced NFĸB activity. Furthermore, increasing the amount of membrane permeable cGMP did not affect IRAK3's ability to reduce NFĸB activity. These results suggest that cGMP generated by IRAK3 may be involved in regulatory function of the protein where the presence of cGMP may selectively affect downstream signalling pathway(s) by modulating binding and/or activity of nearby proteins that interact in the inflammatory signalling cascade.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660347>Impact of Maternal HIV Infection and Placental Malaria on the Transplacental Transfer of Influenza Antibodies in Mother-Infant Pairs in Malawi, 2013-2014.</a></h2><p>Maternal influenza vaccination protects infants against influenza virus infection.

IL-33 is released from stressed or necrotic cells. Initially, IL-33 was described as an inducer of the humoral immune response, which activated Th2 cells and mast cells involved in modulating  and allergic reactions. In addition, IL-33 acts as a stimulator of the Th1, NK, and CD8T cells, which induce a cytotoxic immune response against intracellular pathogens. It was recently discovered that this cytokine is involved in the development of cancer by performing both pro- and antitumor functions. IL-33 can directly affect tumor cells and provokes their proliferation, survival, and metastasis. Moreover, IL-33 stimulates carcinogenesis by remodeling the tumor microenvironment and inducing angiogenesis, thus contributing to the generation of immunosuppressive conditions. At the same time, IL-33 causes tumor infiltration with cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes and natural killers, which leads to cytolysis-mediated cancer cell death. This review describes the versatile role of the IL-33/ST2 cascade in the development of experimental and clinical tumors.

By measuring nuclear bomb test-derived 14C in genomic DNA, we determined the turnover rates of CD4+ and CD8+ naive T-cell populations and defined their dynamics in healthy individuals ranging from 20 to 65 years of age. We demonstrate that naive T-cell generation decreases with age because of a combination of declining peripheral division and thymic production during adulthood. Concomitant decline in T-cell loss compensates for decreased generation rates. We investigated putative mechanisms underlying age-related changes in homeostatic regulation of CD4+ naive T-cell turnover, using mass cytometry to profile candidate signaling pathways involved in T-cell activation and proliferation relative to CD31 expression, a marker of thymic proximity for the CD4+ naive T-cell population. We show that basal nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) phosphorylation positively correlated with CD31 expression and thus is decreased in peripherally expanded naive T-cell clones. Functionally, we found that NF-κB signaling was essential for naive T-cell proliferation to the homeostatic growth factor interleukin (IL)-7, and reduced NF-κB phosphorylation in CD4+CD31- naive T cells is linked to reduced homeostatic proliferation potential. Our results reveal an age-related decline in naive T-cell turnover as a putative regulator of naive T-cell diversity and identify a molecular pathway that restricts proliferation of peripherally expanded naive T-cell clones that accumulate with age.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661891>Molecular Links between Central Obesity and Breast Cancer.</a></h2><p> Worldwide, breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy in women, in regard to incidence and mortality. In recent years, the negative role of obesity during BC development and progression has been made abundantly clear in several studies. However, the distribution of body fat may be more important to analyze than the overall body weight. In our review of literature, we reported some key findings regarding the role of obesity in BC development, but focused more on central adiposity. Firstly, the adipose microenvironment in obese people bears many similarities with the tumor microenvironment, in respect to associated cellular composition, chronic low-grade , and high ratio of reactive oxygen species to antioxidants. Secondly, the adipose tissue functions as an endocrine organ, which in obese people produces a high level of tumor-promoting hormones, such as leptin and estrogen, and a low level of the tumor suppressor hormone, adiponectin. As follows, in BC this leads to the activation of oncogenic signaling pathways: NFκB, JAK, STAT3, AKT. Moreover, overall obesity, but especially central obesity, promotes a systemic and local low grade chronic  that further stimulates the increase of tumor-promoting oxidative stress. Lastly, there is a constant exchange of information between BC cells and adipocytes, mediated especially by extracellular vesicles, and which changes the transcription profile of both cell types to an oncogenic one with the help of regulatory non-coding RNAs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658792>Wound healing effect of regenerated oxidized cellulose versus fibrin sealant patch: An in vivo study.</a></h2><p>Topical hemostatic agents are used when ligation, electrocauterization, or other conventional hemostatic methods are impractical. Because a hemostatic agent is a foreign body, it can cause foreign body reactions, , and infections that can interfere with the wound healing process. Therefore, we should select hemostatic agents after considering their effects on wound healing. Here, we compared the effects of hemostatic agents on wound healing in a rectus abdominis muscle defect in rats.Twelve Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to creation of a 6 × 6 mm defect in the rectus abdominis muscle and divided into four groups: control group; group A, Tachosil fibrin sealant patch; group B, Surgicel Fibrillar oxidized regenerated cellulose; and group C, Surgicel Snow oxidized regenerated cellulose. For the histologic analysis, biopsies were performed on the 3rd, 7th, and 27th days.The foreign body reaction was the weakest in group A and most significant in group C. The inflammatory cell infiltration was the weakest in group A and similar in groups B and C. Muscle regeneration differed among periods. The rats in group A were the most active initially, while those in group C showed prolonged activity.Tachosil and Surgicel administration increased  via foreign body reactions, but the overall wound healing process was not significantly affected. The increased  in the Surgicel groups was due to a low pH. We recommend using Tachosil, because it results in less intense foreign body reactions than Surgicel and faster wound healing due to the fibrin action.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658751> and Probiotics Interactions from a Prolongevity Perspective.</a></h2><p>Probiotics exert beneficial effects on host health through different mechanisms of action, such as production of antimicrobial substances, competition with pathogens, enhancement of host mucosal barrier integrity and immunomodulation. In the context of ageing, which is characterized by several physiological alterations leading to a low grade inflammatory status called inflammageing, evidences suggest a potential prolongevity role of probiotics. Unraveling the mechanisms underlying anti-ageing effects requires the use of simple model systems. To this respect, the nematode  represents a suitable model organism for the study of both host-microbe interactions and for ageing studies, because of conserved signaling pathways and host defense mechanisms involved in the regulation of its lifespan. Therefore, this review analyses the impact of probiotics on  age-related parameters, with particular emphasis on oxidative stress, immunity,  and protection from pathogen infections. The picture emerging from our analysis highlights that several probiotic strains are able to exert anti-ageing effects in nematodes by acting on common molecular pathways, such as insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IIS) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). In this perspective,  appears to be advantageous for shedding light on key mechanisms involved in host prolongevity in response to probiotics supplementation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665348>Cytokine Induction in Nipah Virus-Infected Primary Human and Porcine Bronchial Epithelial Cells.</a></h2><p>During the Nipah virus (NiV) outbreak in Malaysia, pigs and humans were infected. While pigs generally developed severe respiratory disease due to an effective virus replication and associated  processes in the porcine airways, respiratory symptoms in humans were rare and less severe. To elucidate the reasons for the species-specific differences in NiV airway infections, we compared the cytokine responses as a first reaction to NiV in primary porcine and human bronchial epithelial cells (PBEpC and HBEpC, respectively). In both cell types, NiV infections resulted in the expression of type III interferons (IFN-λ). Upon infections with similar virus doses, the viral RNA load and IFN expression were substantially higher in HBEpC. Even if PBEpC expressed the same viral RNA amounts as NiV-infected HBEpC, the porcine cells showed a reduced IFN- and IFN-dependent antiviral gene expression. Despite this inherently limited IFN response, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8) in NiV-infected PBEpC was not decreased. The downregulation of the antiviral activity in the presence of a functional proinflammatory cytokine response might be one of the species-specific factors contributing to efficient virus replication and acute  in the lungs of pigs infected with the Malaysian NiV strain.© The Author(s) 2019.

We used medical records and temporal and spatial data of turtles diagnosed with coccidiosis between 1991 and 2014 to characterize the disease and factors associated with outbreaks. Most affected animals were subadults or older. Neurologic signs with intralesional cerebral coccidia were observed. Coccidia associated with  and necrosis were predominantly found in the intestine, brain, kidney, and thyroid. Cases occurred in the spring and summer. Three major outbreaks (1991, 2002, and 2014) were concentrated in Port Stephens, New South Wales (NSW) and Moreton Bay, Queensland (QLD), but cases occurred as far south as Sydney, NSW. Coccidiosis cases were more likely during, or 1 mo prior to, El Niño-like events. Molecular characterization of the 18S rRNA locus of coccidia from tissues of 10 green turtles collected in 2002 and 2004 in Port Stevens and Sydney imply that they were -like organisms. Two sequences were identified. The genotype 3 sequence was most common (in eight of 10 turtles), with 98.8% similarity to the 18S sequence of . The Genotype 4 sequence was less common (in two of 10 turtles) with 99.7% similarity to the 18S sequence of the most common genotype (Genotype 1) detected in turtles from the 2014 Moreton Bay outbreak. Our study will help with the identification and management of future outbreaks and provide tools for identification of additional disease patterns in green turtles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665016>Neutrophils from severe asthmatic patients induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition in healthy bronchial epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Asthma is a heterogenous disease characterized by chronic  and airway remodeling. An increase in the severity of airway remodeling is associated with a more severe form of asthma. There is increasing interest in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition process and mechanisms involved in the differentiation and repair of the airway epithelium, especially as they apply to severe asthma. Growing evidence suggests that Epithelial-Mesenchymal transition (EMT) could contribute to airway remodeling and fibrosis in asthma. Severe asthmatic patients with remodeled airways have a neutrophil driven . Neutrophils are an important source of TGF-β1, which plays a role in recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells, extracellular matrix (ECM) production and fibrosis development, and is a potent inducer of EMT.As there is little data examining the contribution of neutrophils and/or their mediators to the induction of EMT in airway epithelial cells, the objective of this study was to better understand the potential role of neutrophils in severe asthma in regards to EMT.We used an in vitro system to investigate the neutrophil-epithelial cell interaction. We obtained peripheral blood neutrophils from severe asthmatic patients and control subjects and examined for their ability to induce EMT in primary airway epithelial cells.Our data indicate that neutrophils from severe asthmatic patients induce changes in morphology and EMT marker expression in bronchial epithelial cells consistent with the EMT process when co-cultured. TGF-β1 levels in the culture medium of severe asthmatic patients were increased compared to that from co-cultures of non-asthmatic neutrophils and epithelial cells.As an inducer of EMT and an important source of TGF-β1, neutrophils may play a significant role in the development of airway remodeling and fibrosis in severe asthmatic airways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663301>Interrelationship between inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-33, IL-37) and acquired immunity.</a></h2><p>It is now well-known that interleukins (ILs) play a pivotal role in shaping innate immunity: inflammatory ILs are responsible for all innate aspects of immune response, from the very first vascular reactions to the chronic non-specific response to ; while anti-inflammatory ILs are responsible for keeping adaptive immunity at bay. The interactions between ILs and adaptive immunity have been long considered secondary to the effects on the innate immune system, but in recent years it has appeared more clearly that IL direct interactions with adaptive immunity are extremely important both in physiologic and pathologic immune response. In the present review we analyze the role of inflammatory ILs (IL-1, IL-6, IL-33 and IL-37) on adaptive immunity and briefly discuss the possible therapeutic perspectives of IL-blockade in adaptive immunity disorders.Copyright 2019 Biolife Sas. www.biolifesas.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660146>Fermented black radish ( L. var. ) attenuates methionine and choline deficient diet-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice.</a></h2><p>As one of the wide-ranging form of chronic liver disease, there are only limited therapeutic options for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We evaluated whether fermented black radish ( L. var. ; FBR) ameliorates lipid accumulation, , and hepatic fibrosis, which are characteristics of the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Fermented black radish treatment reduced lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which appeared to be associated with the downregulation of adipogenic transcription factors, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, and lipid accumulation-related genes including adipocyte protein-2 and fatty acid synthase. Administration of FBR to C57BL/6J mice challenged with methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet significantly attenuated the increased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and triglyceride. In addition, treatment with FBR interestingly repressed the hepatic  induced with MCD diet, by lowering the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and suppressing the inactivation of macrophages and Kupffer cells in the liver. Fermented black radish was also shown to mitigate liver fibrosis through the inhibition of alpha-smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor beta-1, and collagen type I alpha 1 chain. Our results indicate that FBR ameliorates NAFLD and its related metabolic disease by regulating multiple pathways, suggesting that FBR may be an effective dietary supplement for ameliorating NAFLD.© 2019 The Authors.

The present study investigates the efficacy of tryptanthrin, a bioactive compound in indigo naturalis, against non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and the signalling events involved.Efficacy of tryptanthrin against NMSC was assessed using DMBA/PMA-induced skin carcinogenesis model in Swiss albino mice. Immunostaining for PCNA and ki-67 was used to mark proliferating cells in tissues. Haematoxylin and eosin staining and toluidine staining were employed to assess , and TUNEL assay was used to detect apoptosis in tissues. The signalling events were evaluated using Western blot, imunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining. MTT assay and clonogenic assay were performed to assess the viability and proliferation of cancer cells, in vitro.In mice, topical application of tryptanthrin suppressed skin carcinogenesis. It attenuated , impeded the proliferation of hair follicle (HF) cells and suppressed the activation of β-catenin, a major driver of HF cell proliferation. Additionally tryptanthrin suppressed the activation of ERK1/2 and p38, both of which promote β-catenin activation and lowered the expression of c-Myc and cyclin-D1. Tryptanthrin suppressed the proliferation of the human NMSC cell line, A431 and abrogated EGF-induced activation of β-catenin and subsequent cytoskeletal rearrangement.The study demonstrates with molecular evidence that tryptanthrin is an effective suppressor of NMSC.© 2019 The Authors.
