In this study, cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp-D- [c(RGDyK)] was conjugated with 2-(p-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (SCN-Bz-NOTA) and then labeled with (68)Ga. The labeled RGD so produced was subjected to an in vitro binding assay and in vivo biodistribution and PET studies.A mixture of SCN-Bz-NOTA (660 nmol) and c(RGDyK) (600 nmol) in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.5) was allowed to react for 20 h at room temperature in the dark for thiourea bond formation. The conjugate obtained was purified by semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The purified c(RGDyK)-SCN-Bz-NOTA (NOTA-RGD) was then labeled with (68)Ga from a (68)Ge/(68)Ga generator and purified by semipreparative HPLC. A competitive binding assay for c(RGDyK) and NOTA-RGD was performed with (125)I-c(RGDyK) as a radioligand and alpha(v)beta(3) integrin-coated plates as a solid phase. (68)Ga-NOTA-RGD (0.222 MBq/100 microL) was injected, through a tail vein, into mice with hind limb ischemia and into mice bearing human  SNU-C4 xenografts. Biodistribution and imaging studies were performed at 1 and 2 h after injection.The labeling of NOTA-RGD with (68)Ga was straightforward. The K(i) values of c(RGDyK) and NOTA-RGD were 1.3 and 1.9 nM, respectively. In the biodistribution study, the mean +/- SD uptake of (68)Ga-NOTA-RGD by ischemic muscles was 1.6+/-0.2 percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g); this uptake was significantly blocked by cold c(RGDyK) to 0.6+/-0.3 %ID/g (P<0.01). Tumor uptake was 5.1+/-1.0 %ID/g, and the tumor-to-blood ratio was 10.3+/-4.8. Small-animal PET revealed rapid excretion through the urine and high levels of tumor and kidney uptake.Stable (68)Ga-NOTA-RGD was obtained in a straightforward manner at a high yield and showed a high affinity for alpha(v)beta(3) integrin, specific uptake by angiogenic muscles, a high level of uptake by tumors, and rapid renal excretion. (68)Ga-NOTA-RGD was found to be a promising radioligand for the imaging of angiogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14734668>Reagents and methods for PET using bispecific antibody pretargeting and 68Ga-radiolabeled bivalent hapten-peptide-chelate conjugates.</a></h2><p>The aim of this work was to develop reagents and methods potentially useful in PET, using (68)Ga in a 2-step pretargeting protocol.We prepared bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) for disease-specific targeting of carcinoembryonic antigen-positive cells and recognition of later-administered bivalent hapten-peptide conjugates. The secondary antibody arm (antibody 679) recognizes a histaminyl-succinyl-glycine (HSG) structural subunit. The bsAbs were prepared as Fab' x Fab' conjugates using chemical cross-linking methods and as bispecific diabodies using recombinant DNA technologies. A HSG-bivalent hapten conjugate bearing the macrocyclic ring chelating agent 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N",N"'-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) was designed to be readily radiolabeled with (68)Ga taken directly from a (68)Ge/(68)Ga generator system. Reagents were tested in vitro and, then, for their targeting properties in a preclinical animal model of human .A chemically cross-linked hMN-14 x 679 F(ab')(2) and a fully humanized bispecific diabody construct (BS1.5H), expressed in Escherichia coli, were prepared for this work. We synthesized the bivalent peptide termed IMP 241 [DOTA-Phe-Lys(HSG)-D-(HSG)-NH(2)] and labeled it with (68)Ga and (67)Ga at temperatures from 45 degrees C to 100 degrees C, over times of 15 min to 1 h, establishing 15 min at 95 degrees C as a useful condition for (68)Ga labeling. When we formulated the IMP 241 bivalent hapten-peptide with ammonium acetate buffer at pH 4-5 and eluted the (68)Ga from the generator directly into the peptide solution, we achieved an almost quantitative incorporation of the (68)Ga into IMP 241, as analyzed by size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography, after mixing the complex with the 679 antibody. For in vivo studies we used (67)Ga-IMP 241 as a surrogate for (68)Ga-IMP 241, in view of the short, 68-min half-life of the (68)Ga nuclide. The (67)Ga-IMP 241 was successfully pretargeted to human  tumor xenografts in athymic mice with both the chemical and the diabody bispecific proteins. High tumor-to-normal tissue ratios for (67)Ga uptake were found for all tissues at 1 to 6 h after injection of (67)Ga-IMP 241. When using the BS1.5H diabody for pretargeting, tumor-to-blood, tumor-to-liver, and tumor-to-lung ratios of (67)Ga-IMP 241 at 1 and 3 h after injection were 41:1 and 137:1, 51:1 and 106:1, and 16:1 and 46:1, respectively.The general approach described, along with the new compositions and the labeling methods we have developed, may eventually allow for use of (68)Ga-labeled specific targeting agents in a routine clinical PET application.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11087333>Experimental pretargeting studies of  with a humanized anti-CEA x murine anti-[In-DTPA] bispecific antibody construct and a (99m)Tc-/(188)Re-labeled peptide.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to localize (99m)Tc and (188)Re radionuclides to tumors, using a bispecific antibody (bsMAb) in a two-step approach where the radionuclides are attached to novel peptides incorporating moieties recognized by one arm of the bsMAb. A chemically cross-linked human/murine bsMAb, hMN-14 x 734 (Fab' x Fab'), anti-carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA] x anti-indium-DTPA was prepared as a prelude to constructing a fully humanized bsMAb for future clinical application. N,N'-o-Phenylenedimaleimide was used to cross-link the Fab' fragments of the two antibodies at their hinge regions. This construct was shown to be >92% pure and fully reactive with CEA and a divalent (indium)DTPA-peptide. For pretargeting purposes, a peptide, IMP-192 [Ac-Lys(In-DTPA)-(In-DTPA)-Lys(TscG-Cys-)-NH(2) ¿TscG = 3-thiosemicarbazonylglyoxyl¿], with two indium-DTPAs and a chelate for selectively binding (99m)Tc or (188)Re, was synthesized. IMP-192 was formulated in a "single dose" kit and later radiolabeled with (99m)Tc (94-99%) at up to 1836 Ci/mmol and with (188)Re (97%) at 459-945 Ci/mmol of peptide. [(99m)Tc]IMP-192 was shown to be stable by extensive in vitro and in vivo testing and had no specific uptake in the tumor with minimal renal uptake. The biodistribution of the hMN-14 x murine 734 bsMAb was compared alone and in a pretargeting setting to a fully murine anti-CEA (F6) x 734 bsMAb that was reported previously [Gautherot, E., Bouhou, J., LeDoussal, J.-M., Manetti, C., Martin, M., Rouvier, E., and Barbet, J. (1997) Therapy for  carcinoma xenografts with bispecific antibody-targeted, iodine-131-labeled bivalent hapten.  80 (Suppl.), 2618-2623]. Both bsMAbs maintained their integrity and dual binding specificity in vivo, but the hMN-14 x m734 was cleared more rapidly from the blood. This coincided with an increased uptake of the hMN-14 x m734 bsMAb in the liver and spleen, suggesting an active reticuloendothelial cell recognition mechanism of this mixed species construct in naive mice. Animals bearing GW-39 human   xenografts were injected with bsMAb (15 microg) and after allowing 24 or 72 h for the bsMAb constructs to clear from the blood (hMN-14 and murine F6 x 734, respectively), [(188)Re]IMP-192 (7 microCi) or [(99m)Tc]IMP-192 (10 microCi) was injected at a bsMAb:peptide ratio of 10:1. Tumor uptake of [(99m)Tc] or [(188)Re]IMP-192 was 12.6 +/- 5.2 and 16.9 +/- 5.5% ID/g at 3 h postinjection, respectively. Tumor/nontumor ratios were between 5.6 and 23 to 1 for every major organ, indicating that early imaging with (99m)Tc will be possible. Radiation absorbed doses showed a 4.8-, 7.2-, and a 12.6 to 1.0 tumor to blood, kidney, and liver ratios when (188)Re was used. Although this new bsMAb pretargeting approach requires further optimization, it already shows very promising targeting results for both radioimmunodetection and radioimmunotherapy of colorectal .</p></html>
