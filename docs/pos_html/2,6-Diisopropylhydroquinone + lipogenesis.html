<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298611> Extract Reduces High-Fat Diet-Induced Obesity Through Regulation of  and  Pathways in Mice.</a></h2><p>Obesity is caused by an energy imbalance between food intake and energy expenditure, and has detrimental effects on human health. Platycodon () widely grows in Korea, Japan, and China. It has long been used for food and as a medicinal product. However, the mechanism of the improvement of obesity by platycodon was still not clear. Therefore, we investigated the detailed mechanisms of the antiobesity activity of platycodon extracts. Twenty mice (C57BL/6J) were placed into five groups. The test group received 1 g/kg platycodon extracts. The positive control group received 10 mg/kg orlistat, while the negative control and normal control groups received phosphate-buffered saline. The extracts were given orally daily for 8 weeks. The  treatment of platycodon extracts reduced body weight gain by 7.5%, improved plasma lipid profiles. In the groups given platycodon extracts, leptin was significantly decreased whereas adiponectin was increased. Furthermore, platycodon extracts downregulated lipogenic gene (, lipoprotein lipase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and fatty acid synthase) expression and increased lipolysis genes (, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, hormone-sensitive lipase, and uncoupling proteins ) in liver and white adipose tissue. In addition, platycodon extracts inhibited the expression of key adipogenic transcriptional factors. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that platycodon extracts ameliorate high-fat diet-induced obesity and its related metabolic disease by regulating multiple pathways. Dietary supplementation of platycodon extracts as a functional food and medicinal ingredients may be suitable for prevention and treatment of obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661889>Combined Exposure to Fructose and Bisphenol A Exacerbates Abnormal Lipid Metabolism in Liver of Developmental Male Rats.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether combined exposure to fructose and bisphenol A (BPA) has a synergistic effect on abnormal lipid metabolism in the liver of developmental male rats and its possible mechanism. Fifty weaned male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: the control, 13% fructose, 20% fructose, 1 µg/mL BPA, and 13% fructose + 1 µg/mL BPA (combined exposure). Rats were exposed to fructose and/or BPA through drinking water for eight weeks. Genes or proteins regulating lipid metabolism include sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), zinc α  glycoprotein (ZAG) and estrogen receptor α (ERα), and the expression of proteins regulating inflammatory response, such as TLR4 and NF-κB, were determined. Serum total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), low, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, HDL-C), blood glucose, insulin, IL-17 and TNF-α levels were also measured. Liver tissue morphology was observed by H&E staining. The results showed that the levels of gene and protein catalyzing  were increased (SREBP1, ACC1 and FAS), while those catalyzing lipolysis were decreased (ATGL, HSL and ZAG), accompanied by dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hepatic fat accumulation, and there were higher expression of TLR4 and NF-κB protein and lower expression of ERα protein in liver, and increased serum IL-17 and TNF-α levels in fructose and/or BPA exposed rats compared with controls. Moreover, the above indicators were more serious in combined exposure group than in single exposure group. Therefore, abnormal lipid metabolism in the liver of developmental rats could be exacerbated by combined exposed to fructose and BPA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31525727>GLUCAGON MODULATES PROLIFERATION AND DIFFERENTIATION OF HUMAN ADIPOSE PRECURSORS.</a></h2><p>Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), which are currently used for the treatment of type  diabetes, have recently been proposed as anti-obesity drugs, due to their relevant effects on weight loss. Furthermore, dual agonists for both GLP-1R and glucagon receptor (GCGR) are under investigation for their promising action on adiposity, although underlying mechanisms still need to be clarified. We have recently demonstrated that GLP-1 and liraglutide interfere with the proliferation and differentiation of human adipose precursors, supporting the hypothesis of a peripheral action of GLP-1RA on weight. Here, we investigated glucagon activity in an in vitro model of primary human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). Glucagon significantly inhibited ASC proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as evaluated by cell count and thymidine incorporation. When added during in vitro-induced , glucagon significantly reduced adipocyte differentiation, as demonstrated by the evaluation of intracellular fat content and quantitative expression of early and mature adipocyte markers (PPARγ and FABP4, HSL). Notably, the inhibitory effect of glucagon on cell proliferation and  was reversed by specific GLP-1R (exendin-9) and GCGR [des-His1-Glu9-glucagon(1-29)] antagonists. The presence of both receptors was demonstrated by Western blot, immunofluorescence and cytofluorimetric analysis of ASCs. In conclusion, we demonstrated a direct inhibitory action of glucagon on the proliferation and differentiation of human adipose precursors, which seems to involve both GLP-1R and GCGR. These findings suggest that the adipose stem compartment is a novel target of glucagon, possibly contributing to the weight loss obtained in vivo with dual GLP-1R/glucagon agonists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31239155>LncRNA NEAT1-MicroRNA-140 axis exacerbates nonalcoholic fatty liver through interrupting AMPK/SREBP-1 signaling.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a severe liver disease, which influences the health of people worldwide. However, the mechanism modulating the pathogenesis of NAFLD remains elusive. It was reported that nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) and microRNA-140 (miR-140) could regulate , but whether they could influence NAFLD are still unknown.HepG2 cells were treated by free fatty acids (FFA) to establish the model of NAFLD in vitro, and C57 mice were treated by high-fat diet to establish the model of NAFLD in vivo. Cell transfection was applied to regulate the expression of NEAT1 and miR-140. Western blotting and qRT-PCR were applied for measuring expression of protein and mRNA, respectively. HE staining and Oil Red O staining were used for observing liver tissues.NEAT1 and miR-140 are upregulated in hepacytes under the NAFLD conditions. NEAT1 directly binds to miR-140 and acts synergistically with miR-140 to exacerbate the progression of NAFLD. Reciprocally, silence of miR-140 or NEAT1 alleviates the severity of NAFLD. The mechanistical study shows that the axis of NEAT1-miR-140 inactivates AMPK/SREBP-1 signaling during the NAFLD. .The NEAT1-miR-140 axis play a crucial role in modulation of NAFLD via inactivation of AMPK/SREBP1 signaling. This study may provide a novel insight for the treatment of NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the critical mediators and the signal transductions are not well demonstrated. As ovipara, chicken represents a specific case in lipid metabolism that liver is the main site of lipid synthesis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the linkage of gut microbiota and fat synthesis in broiler chickens. The broilers were subjected to dietary treatments of combined probiotics (: 4 × 10 cfu/kg; :  × 10 cfu/kg; :  × 10 cfu/kg; :  × 10 cfu/kg, PB) and guar gum (1 g/kg, GG), respectively. Results showed that dietary supplementation of PB and GG changed the cecal microbiota diversity, altered short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) contents, and suppressed . In intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) up-regulated the expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, mainly via the phospho - extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phospho-p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways. GLP-1 suppressed lipid accumulation in primary hepatocytes with the involvement of (AMP)-activated protein kinase/Acetyl CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) signaling. In conclusion, the result suggests that SCFAs-induced GLP-1 secretion via MAPK pathway, which links the regulation of gut microbiota on hepatic  in chickens.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Sun, Zhao, Chen, Fan, Jiao, Zhao, Wang, Li, Li and Lin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31324879>Bone morphogenetic protein  is a depot-specific regulator of human .</a></h2><p>Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) regulate  but it is not clear whether they influence regional adipose tissue (AT) development in humans.To characterise BMP2 expression, BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 signalling, and BMP2's potential effect on proliferation and  in human subcutaneous abdominal and gluteal AT and its constituent preadipocytes.BMP2 expression was measured in whole AT and immortalised preadipocytes via qPCR and Western blot; secreted/circulating BMP2 was measured by ELISA. The effect of BMP2 on preadipocyte proliferation was evaluated using a fluorescent assay. BMP2's effect on  in immortalised preadipocytes was determined via qPCR of adipogenic markers and cellular triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation. BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 signalling was assessed in immortalised preadipocytes via Western blot and qPCR of ID1 expression.BMP2 was expressed and released by abdominal and gluteal AT and preadipocytes. Exogenous BMP2 dose dependently promoted  in abdominal preadipocytes only; 50 ng/ml BMP2 increased PPARG2 expression (10-fold compared to vehicle, p < 0.001) and TAG accumulation (3-fold compared to vehicle; p < 0.001). BMP2 stimulated SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation and ID1 expression in abdominal and gluteal preadipocytes but this was blocked by 500 nM K02288, a type 1 BMP receptor inhibitor (p < 0.001). Co-administration of 500 nM K02288 also inhibited the pro-adipogenic effect of 50 ng/ml BMP2 in abdominal cells; >90% inhibition of TAG accumulation (p < 0.001) and ~50% inhibition of PPARG2 expression (p < 0.001). The endogenous iron regulator erythroferrone reduced BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 signalling by ~30% specifically in subcutaneous abdominal preadipocytes (p < 0.01), suggesting it plays a role in restricting the expansion of the body's largest AT depot during energy deficiency. Additionally, a waist-hip ratio-increasing common polymorphism near BMP2 is an eQTL associated with ~15% lower BMP2 expression in abdominal and gluteal AT (p < 0.05) as well as altered adipocyte size in male abdominal AT (p < 0.05).These data implicate BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 signalling in depot-specific preadipocyte development and abdominal AT expansion in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31271850>Adipose lipidomics and RNA-Seq analysis revealed the enhanced mitochondrial function in UCP1 knock-in pigs.</a></h2><p>Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) plays a key role in nonshivering thermogenesis and is involved in the pathogenesis of obesity. In a previous study, we generated adipocyte-specific UCP1 knock-in (UCP1-KI) pigs, which exhibited improved thermoregulatory ability and decreased fat deposition. To investigate whether UCP1 knock-in alters the lipid composition of adipose tissues, lipidomics of inguinal subcutaneous white adipose tissue (iWAT) and backfat from 6-month-old cold-treated UCP1-KI pigs and wild-type (WT) pigs were profiled. In addition, genome-wide RNA-sequencing of iWAT was performed to further study the genetic basis for lipid alterations. The results showed that iWAT and backfat from UCP1-KI pigs exhibited distinct lipidomic profiles, as the mild lipid alteration was observed in backfat of UCP1 knock-in pigs. Inguinal WAT from UCP1-KI pigs contained significantly decreased total triacylglycerol (p < 0.05), together with the downregulation of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, suggesting the decreased  in iWAT of UCP1-KI pigs. Significantly increased levels of total sphingolipids (p<0.05) were also observed in iWAT from UCP1-KI pigs. Notably, two mitochondrial-specific lipid species, cardiolipin CL72:8 (18:) and CL74:9 (18:), were found to be dramatically increased in iWAT from UCP1-KI pigs, suggesting enhanced mitochondrial function. This observation was further supported by the significant upregulation of numerous mitochondrial-related genes and significantly increased number of large mitochondria and mitochondrial cristae in iWAT of UCP1-KI pigs. Taken together, these data illustrate the specific role of UCP1 in lipid metabolism of fat tissues in pigs and provide new data for characterization of fat traits in UCP1-KI pigs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Since its side effects include skin dryness, whereas its deficiency can be accompanied by dyssebacia, characterized by sebaceous gland enlargement, we asked if HCA is expressed on human sebocytes, and if NA influences sebocyte functions. By using human immortalized SZ95 sebocytes, we found that non-cytotoxic (≤100 μmol/L; MTT-assay) concentrations of NA had no effect on the homeostatic sebaceous  (SLG; Nile Red), but normalized excessive, acne-mimicking SLG induced by several lipogenic agents (arachidonic acid, anandamide, linoleic acid + testosterone; Nile Red; 48-hr treatments). Moreover, it exerted significant anti-proliferative actions (CyQUANT-assay), and increased [Ca ] (Fluo-4 AM-based Ca -measurement). Although NA did not prevent the lipopolysaccharide-induced pro-inflammatory response (up-regulation [Q-PCR] and release [ELISA] of several pro-inflammatory cytokines) of the sebocytes, collectively, these data support the concept that NA may be effective in suppressing sebum production in vivo. While exploring the mechanism of the sebostatic actions, we found that sebocytes express HCA (Q-PCR, immunofluorescent labelling), siRNA-mediated silencing of which prevented the NA-induced Ca -signal and the lipostatic action. Collectively, our data introduce NA, and HCA activators in general, as novel, potent and most likely safe sebostatic agents, with possible anti-acne potential.© 2019 The Authors.

Hydroxytyrosol (HT), a simple polyphenol found in virgin olive oil, is considered to be beneficial for cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. The current study determined whether HT could improve PM-induced adiposity and insulin resistance (IR), and explored the underlying mechanisms. Fifteen adult female C57BL/6j mice on a chow diet were randomly divided into three groups receiving (1) sterile PBS, () PM suspended in sterile PBS (1 mg/mL) and (3) PM+HT (50 mg/kg/day). PM/PBS exposure was administered by oropharynx instillation every other day and HT supplementation was achieved by gavage every day. Four-week PM exposure did not affect body weight, but significantly increased visceral fat mass. The abdominal adiposity coincided with adipocyte hypertrophy and proliferation in visceral white adipose tissue (WAT), as well as decreased metabolic activity in brown adipose tissue and subcutaneous WAT. PM enhanced the oxidative stress by diminishing antioxidant enzyme activities in liver and serum, whereas contents of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in liver and serum were elevated. These changes were accompanied by macrophage infiltration and activation of NF-κB pathway in the liver. Moreover, PM exposure led to glucose intolerance and insulin insensitivity, impaired hepatic glycogenesis, and decreased insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in peripheral tissues. Importantly, HT treatment prevented PM-induced visceral , oxidative stress, hepatic inflammation and NF-κB activation, systemic and peripheral IR. In vitro, after HepG2 cells were incubated with PM (0, 5, 25, 50, 100 and 200 μg/mL), reduced glutathione depletion and 4-HNE, 8-hydroxy-'-deoxyguanosine, MDA increment in a dose-dependent manner were observed; likewise, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Further, with antioxidant NAC and NF-κB inhibitor PDTC, we confirmed that HT attenuated PM-induced IR through restraining NF-κB activation evoked by oxidative stress. In addition, HT could expand gut microbiota richness, reduce pathogenic bacteria and accommodate the microbial architecture in PM-exposed mice, which were correlated with parameters of adiposity, oxidative stress and glycometabolism. HT could effectively correct imbalanced oxidative stress triggered by PM, in turn ameliorated NF-κB pathway and insulin signaling. Gut microbiota may mediate the actions of HT.Copyright © 2019.

However, the effects of HMF on  remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that HMF inhibits the early stage of  and maturation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. HMF treatment during preadipocyte differentiation for 8 days reduced lipid accumulation in a dose-dependent manner, and the expression levels of key adipogenic transcription factors (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα)) and the lipogenic transcription factor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP1), were lower after the initial 4 days of the differentiation. Moreover, PPARγ expression level was lower even after the initial  days, but C/EBPα and SREBP1 expression was not. HMF upregulated the phosphorylation of protein kinase A catalytic subunit α (PKACα), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in 3T3-L1 cells. The phosphorylation of ACC leads to the inhibition of . Furthermore, the induction of phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC by HMF was abolished by RNA interference targeting PKACα.

However, knowledge of the cellular transition from BAT to white adipose tissue (WAT) and the potential role of lncRNAs in goat adipose tissue remains largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the transformation from BAT to WAT using histological and uncoupling protein 1 () gene analyses. Brown adipose tissue mainly existed within the goat perirenal fat at 1 day and there was obviously a transition from BAT to WAT from 1 day to 1 year. The RNA libraries constructed from the perirenal adipose tissues of 1 day, 30 days, and 1 year goats were sequenced. A total number of 21,232 lncRNAs from perirenal fat were identified, including 5393 intronic-lncRNAs and 3546 antisense-lncRNAs. Furthermore, a total of 548 differentially expressed lncRNAs were detected across three stages (fold change ≥ .0, false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05), and six lncRNAs were validated by qPCR. Furthermore,  analysis found lncRNAs that were transcribed close to 890 protein-coding genes. Additionally, a coexpression network suggested that 4519 lncRNAs and 5212 mRNAs were potentially in -regulatory relationships ( > 0.95 or  < -0.95). In addition, Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses showed that the targeted genes were involved in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, fatty acid elongation and metabolism, the citrate cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathways.

The recent CVD European Guidelines strongly recommend regular physical exercise (PE) as a management strategy for prevention and treatment of CVD associated with metabolic disorders and obesity. Although mutations as well as common genetic variants, including the  Val66Met polymorphism, are associated with increased body weight, eating and neuropsychiatric disorders, and myocardial infarction, the effect of this polymorphism on adipose tissue accumulation and regulation as well as its relation to obesity/thrombosis remains to be elucidated. Here, we showed that white adipose tissue (WAT) of humanized knock-in BDNFVal66Met (BDNF) mice is characterized by an altered morphology and an enhanced inflammatory profile compared to wild-type BDNF. Four weeks of voluntary PE restored the adipocyte size distribution, counteracted the inflammatory profile of adipose tissue, and prevented the prothrombotic phenotype displayed, per se, by BDNF mice. C3H10T1/ cells treated with the Pro-BDNFMet peptide well recapitulated the gene alterations observed in BDNF WAT mice. In conclusion, these data indicate the strong impact of lifestyle, in particular of the beneficial effect of PE, on the management of arterial thrombosis and inflammation associated with obesity in relation to the specific BDNF Val66Met mutation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31351176>Glutathione deficiency-elicited reprogramming of hepatic metabolism protects against alcohol-induced steatosis.</a></h2><p>Depletion of glutathione (GSH) is considered a critical pathogenic event promoting alcohol-induced lipotoxicity. We recently show that systemic GSH deficiency in mice harboring a global disruption of the glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (Gclm) gene confers protection against alcohol-induced steatosis. While several molecular pathways have been linked to the observed hepatic protection, including nuclear factor erythroid -related factor  and AMP-activated protein kinase pathways, the precise mechanisms are yet to be defined. In this study, to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underpinning the protective effects of loss of GCLM, global profiling of hepatic polar metabolites combined with liver microarray analysis was carried out. These inter-omics analyses revealed both low GSH- and alcohol-driven changes in multiple cellular pathways involving the metabolism of amino acids, fatty acid, glucose and nucleic acids. Notably, several metabolic changes were uniquely present in alcohol-treated Gclm-null mouse livers, including acetyl-CoA enrichment and diversion of acetyl-CoA flux from  to alterative metabolic pathways, elevation in glutamate concentration, and induction of the glucuronate pathway and nucleotide biosynthesis. These metabolic features reflect low GSH-elicited cellular response to chronic alcohol exposure, which is beneficial for the maintenance of hepatic redox and metabolic homeostasis. The current study indicates that fine-tuning of hepatic GSH pool may evoke metabolic reprogramming to cope with alcohol-induced cellular stress.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

A characteristic of chloracne, in contrast to acne vulgaris, is shrinkage or loss of sebaceous glands. Acne vulgaris, on the other hand, is often accompanied by excessive sebum production. Here, we examined the role of AHR in lipid synthesis in human sebocytes using distinct classes of AHR ligands. Modulation of AHR activity attenuated the expression of lipogenic genes and key pro-inflammatory markers in the absence of canonical DRE-driven transcription of the AHR target gene CYP1A1. Furthermore, topical treatment with TCDD, which mediates DRE-dependent activity, and SGA360, which fails to induce DRE-mediated responses, both exhibited a decrease in the size of sebaceous glands and the number of sebocytes within each gland in the skin. To elucidate the mechanism of AHR-mediated repression of lipid synthesis, we demonstrated that selective AHR modulators, SGA360 and SGA315 increased the protein turnover of the mature sterol regulatory element-binding protein (mSREBP-1), the principal transcriptional regulator of the fatty acid synthesis pathway. Interestingly, selective AHR ligand treatment significantly activated the AMPK-dependent kinase (AMPK) in sebocytes. Moreover, we demonstrated an inverse correlation between the active AMPK and the mSREBP-1 protein, which is consistent with the previously reported role of AMPK in inhibiting cleavage of SREBP-1. Overall, our findings indicate a DRE-independent function of selective AHR ligands in modulating lipid synthesis in human sebocytes, which might raise the possibility of using AHR as a therapeutic target for treatment of acne.© The Author(s) 2019.

Accumulating evidence, however, demonstrates that many of these factors, such as BMP- and -4, as well as GDF15, also regulate lipid metabolism. GDF10 is a divergent member of the TGFβ superfamily with a unique structure and is abundantly expressed in brain and adipose tissue; it is also secreted by the latter into the circulation. Although previous studies have demonstrated that overexpression of GDF10 reduces adiposity in mice, the role of circulating GDF10 on other tissues known to regulate lipid, like the liver, has not yet been examined.Accordingly, GDF10 mice and age-matched GDF10 control mice were fed either normal control diet (NCD) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks and examined for changes in liver lipid homeostasis. Additional studies were also carried out in primary and immortalized human hepatocytes treated with recombinant human (rh)GDF10.Here, we show that circulating GDF10 levels are increased in conditions of diet-induced hepatic steatosis and, in turn, that secreted GDF10 can prevent excessive lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. We also report that GDF10 mice develop an obese phenotype as well as increased liver triglyceride accumulation when fed a NCD. Furthermore, HFD-fed GDF10 mice develop increased steatosis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, fibrosis, and injury of the liver compared to HFD-fed GDF10 mice. To explain these observations, studies in cultured hepatocytes led to the observation that GDF10 attenuates nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) activity; a transcription factor known to induce de novo .Our work delineates a hepatoprotective role of GDF10 as an adipokine capable of regulating hepatic lipid levels by blocking de novo  to protect against ER stress and liver injury.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress have been recognized as key mechanisms in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis. Whether Orai1 facilitates ER stress by oxidative stress remains unknown. The rat model of NAFLD was constructed by feeding high-fat diet (HFD). BRL-3A cells were treated with NEFAs, Orai1inhibtor BTP2, NFκB inhibitor wogonin, or small interfering Orai (siOrai) 1, respectively. The content of intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA), indicating oxidative stress, was measured by a spectrophotometer. ER stress major proteins PERK, IRE1, ATF6, CHOP, and GRP78 were quantified using Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses. For the intracellular location of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Orai1 were measured by Western blot and immunofluorescence, and cytosolic Ca was measured by flow cytometry. As we expected, the liver of rats with NAFLD showed lipid droplets in HE and Oil Red O. The decreased GSH and increased MDA were found in rats fed with HFD. ER stress major proteins PERK, IRE1, ATF6, GRP78, and CHOP were significantly increased in the HFD group. In BRL-3A cells, GSH content dramatically decreased from 1 h, MDA content dramatically increased from 3 h, and expression levels of ER stress significantly increased from 3 h by NEFA treatment. Furthermore, cytosolic Ca increased from 0.5 h by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells. It indicated that NEFAs increased cytosolic Ca to induce oxidative stress, thus ER stress. The content of oxidative stress and ER stress proteins showed the same trends by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells. These effects were reversed by the Orai1 inhibitor BTP2 and the NFκB inhibitor wogonin. Moreover, siOrai1 abrogated NEFAs' influence in BRL-3A cells. Last, ROS was found by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells, and NEFA treatment enhanced the nuclear localization of NF-κB p65 and ORAI1. It was considered that high NEFAs increased cytosolic Ca and enhanced NFκB-dependent SOCE and its moiety protein Orai1 to decrease GSH and thus induced oxidative stress at earlier stages and furthermore tempted ER stress in the pathologic progress of NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Li, Zou, Guo, Zhang, Xia, Zhang, Yang and Xu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31466350>Changes in Plasma Free Fatty Acids Associated with Type- Diabetes.</a></h2><p>Type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with increased total plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations and an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. The exact mechanisms by which the plasma FFA profile of subjects with T2DM changes is unclear, but it is thought that dietary fats and changes to lipid metabolism are likely to contribute. Therefore, establishing the changes in concentrations of specific FFAs in an individual's plasma is important. Each type of FFA has different effects on physiological processes, including the regulation of lipolysis and  in adipose tissue, inflammation, endocrine signalling and the composition and properties of cellular membranes. Alterations in such processes due to altered plasma FFA concentrations/profiles can potentially result in the development of insulin resistance and coagulatory defects. Finally, fibrates and statins, lipid-regulating drugs prescribed to subjects with T2DM, are also thought to exert part of their beneficial effects by impacting on plasma FFA concentrations. Thus, it is also interesting to consider their effects on the concentration of FFAs in plasma. Collectively, we review how FFAs are altered in T2DM and explore the likely downstream physiological and pathological implications of such changes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31261664>Identification of Pyrvinium, an Anthelmintic Drug, as a Novel Anti-Adipogenic Compound Based on the Gene Expression Microarray and Connectivity Map.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a serious health problem, while the current anti-obesity drugs are not very effective. The Connectivity Map (C-Map), an in-silico drug screening approach based on gene expression profiles, has recently been indicated as a promising strategy for drug repositioning. In this study, we performed mRNA expression profile analysis using microarray technology and identified 435 differentially expressed genes (DEG) during  in both C3H10T1/ and 3T3-L1 cells. Then, DEG signature was uploaded into C-Map, and using pattern-matching methods we discovered that pyrvinium, a classical anthelminthic, is a novel anti-adipogenic differentiation agent. Pyrvinium suppressed adipogenic differentiation in a dose-dependent manner, as evidenced by Oil Red O staining and the mRNA levels of adipogenic markers. Furthermore, we identified that the inhibitory effect of pyrvinium was resulted primarily from the early stage of . Molecular studies showed that pyrvinium downregulated the expression of key transcription factors C/EBPa and PPARγ. The mRNA levels of notch target genes  and  were obviously reduced after pyrvinium treatment. Taken together, this study identified many differentially expressed genes involved in  and demonstrated for the first time that pyrvinium is a novel anti-adipogenic compound for obesity therapy.

The fat tissue is an important target for DINP exposure, however, very little is understood about its toxicity and mechanism(s) in adipocyte cells. Therefore, the present work aimed to investigate the role of DINP in  using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. DINP exposure for 10 days extensively induced  in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to adipocytes as assessed by lipid accumulation and gene expression of adipogenic markers. The RT-qPCR results showed that DINP could upregulate the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPα) and C/EBPβ, while the expression of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1) and C/EBPδ was not affected. The DINP-induced  could be inhibited by using the selective PPARγ antagonist GW9662. The RNA-seq analysis was used to study the systemic toxicities of DINP on preadipocytes. A total of 1181 differently expressed genes (DEGs) (640 genes were up-regulated, 541 genes were down-regulated) were detected in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes under 50 μM DINP. The GO enrichment showed the GO term of "fat cell differentiation" was the most significantly affected metabolic functions, and the KEGG pathway enrichment showed the PPAR pathway was the top affected pathway. The interactive pathway (iPath) analysis showed that the changed metabolic pathways were focus on the lipid metabolism.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Blood analyte measurements were used for correlation and mediation analysis to investigate how age, BMI, and fat percentage affect the relation between DLK1 and GDR. Confirmatory animal studies performed in normal (NC) and high fat diet (HFD) fed Dlk1 and Dlk1 mice included DXA scanning, glucose tolerance tests (GTTs), blood measurements, and skeletal muscle glucose uptake studies by positron emission tomography (PET), histology, qRT-PCR, and in vitro cell studies.Overall, DLK1 is positively correlated with fat amounts, which is consistent with a negative linear relationship between DLK1 and GDR. This relationship is not mediated by age, BMI, or fat percentage. In support, DLK1 also correlates positively with HOMA-IR and ADIPO-IR in these humans, but has no linear relationship with the early diabetic inflammation marker MCP-1. In Dlk1 mice, the increase in fat percentage and adipocyte size induced by HFD is attenuated, and these animals are protected against insulin resistance. These Dlk1 effects seem independent of gluconeogenesis, but at least partly relies on increased in vivo glucose uptake in skeletal muscles by Dlk1 regulating the major glucose transporter Glut4 in vivo as well as in two independent cell lines.Thus, instead of an adipogenic inhibitor, Dlk1 should be regarded as a factor causally linked to obesity and insulin resistance, and may be used to predict development of type  diabetes.

It is well known that, in beef, the main FAs associated with these biological processes are oleic acid (C18:1 cis9, OA) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA-c9t11), which may have beneficial effects on metabolic diseases such as type  diabetes and obesity. Here, we performed differential expression and co-expression analyses, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and partial correlation with information theory (PCIT), to uncover the complex interactions between miRNAs and mRNAs expressed in skeletal muscle associated with FA content. miRNA and mRNA expression data were obtained from skeletal muscle of Nelore cattle that had extreme genomic breeding values for OA and CLA. Insulin and MAPK signaling pathways were identified by WGCNA as central pathways associated with both of these fatty acids. Co-expression network analysis identified bta-miR-33a/b, bta-miR-100, bta-miR-204, bta-miR-365-5p, bta-miR-660, bta-miR-411a, bta-miR-136, bta-miR-30-5p, bta-miR-146b, bta-let-7a-5p, bta-let-7f, bta-let-7, bta-miR 339, bta-miR-10b, bta-miR 486, and the genes  and  as potential regulators of fatty acid synthesis.

If the derangement of epicardial fat adjoins the left atrium, the result is an atrial myopathy, which is clinically manifest as AF. In patients with AF, there is a close relationship between epicardial fat volume and the severity of electrophysiological abnormalities in the adjacent myocardial tissues, and epicardial fat mass predicts AF in the general population. The expansion of epicardial adipose tissue in obesity and type  diabetes may also affect the left ventricle, impairing its distensibility and leading to heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Patients with obesity or type  diabetes with AF often have HFpEF, but the diagnosis may be missed, if dyspnea is attributed to increased body mass or to the arrhythmia. The expected response to the treatment for obesity, diabetes or AF may be influenced by their effects on epicardial inflammation and the underlying atrial and ventricular myopathy. Bariatric surgery and metformin reduce epicardial fat mass and ameliorate AF, whereas insulin promotes  and cardiac fibrosis, and its use is accompanied by an increased risk of AF. Rate control strategies for AF may impair exercise tolerance, because they allow for greater time for ventricular filling in patients who cannot tolerate volume loading because of cardiac fibrosis and HFpEF. At the same time, both obesity and diabetes decrease the expected success rate of rhythm control strategies for AF (e.g., electrical cardioversion or catheter ablation), because increased epicardial adipose tissue volumes and cardiac fibrosis are important determinants of AF recurrence following these procedures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615896>The transcription factor NKX1- promotes  and may contribute to a balance between adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation.</a></h2><p>Although  is mainly controlled by a small number of master transcription factors including CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family members and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), other transcription factors also are involved in this process. Thyroid cancer cells expressing a paired box 8 (PAX8)-PPARγ fusion oncogene trans-differentiate into adipocyte-like cells in the presence of the PPARγ ligand pioglitazone, but this trans-differentiation is inhibited by the transcription factor NK2 homeobox 1 (NKX2-1). Here, we tested whether NKX family members may play a role also in normal . Using quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR), we examined the expression of all 14 NKX family members during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. We found that most NKX members, including NKX2-1, are expressed at very low levels throughout differentiation. However, mRNA and protein expression of a related family member, NKX1-, was induced during adipocyte differentiation. NKX1- also was up-regulated in cultured murine ear mesenchymal stem cells (EMSCs) during . Importantly, shRNA-mediated NKX1- knockdown in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes or EMSCs almost completely blocked adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, NKX1- overexpression promoted differentiation of the ST2 bone marrow-derived mesenchymal precursor cell line into adipocytes. Additional findings suggested that NKX1- promotes  by inhibiting expression of the antiadipogenic protein COUP transcription factor II. Bone marrow mesenchymal precursor cells can differentiate into adipocytes or osteoblasts, and we found that NKX1-  both promotes ST2 cell  and inhibits their osteoblastogenic differentiation.

Hydrogen sulfide plays a crucial role in the maintenance and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) that have the potential to differentiate to a diverse group of mesenchymally derived cells. It was shown that these cells show a heavy reliance on cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS)-derived hydrogen sulfide (HS) during differentiation. We have found that expression and activity of 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST), one of three enzymes that hat regulates HS biosynthesis, is significantly lower in MSC as compared with lineage-restricted dermal fibroblasts. Here, we tested the hypothesis that suppression of MPST in dermal fibroblasts might induce plasticity-related changes and broaden the transdifferentiation potency. Inactivation of MPST with phenylpyruvate (PP) or by siRNA silencing led to diminished HS production associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lactic acid. Accumulation of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), a key metabolite required for the expression of ten-eleven translocation hydroxylase (TET), was associated with stimulated transcription of pluripotency related genes including OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, and NANOG. Suppression of TET1 gene and inhibition of glycolysis with glucose analog, -desoxy-d-glucose, or hexokinase II inhibitor significantly reduced expression of pluripotency genes following MPST inactivation or knockdown. MPST disruption promoted the conversion of fibroblasts into adipocytes as evidenced by a significant increase in expression of adipocyte-specific genes, PPARγ, and UCP1, and intracellular accumulation of oil Red-O positive fat droplets. Inhibition of glycolysis inhibited these changes. Under induced differentiation conditions, fibroblasts with disrupted MPST show the potency to differentiate to white adipogenic lineage. Thus, MPST inactivation or silencing enhances the plasticity of dermal fibroblasts in a TET1 and glycolysis dependent manner and promotes adipogenic transdifferentiation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

At the same time, the results of evaluating the clinical efficacy of Q are ambiguous, and the mechanisms of its influence on lipid and carbohydrate-energy metabolism are not well understood.  of the work was to study the effect of quercetin (Q 3,3',4',5,7-pentahydroxyflavone) on the expression of key glycolysis and  enzymes' genes in Zucker-Leprfa (Z) rats characterized by hereditary obesity, compared to «wild-type» Wistar (W) rats. . 24 male Z rats and 32 male W rats aged 8-10 weeks were used. Animals of each line were divided into 4 groups of equal numbers. For 62 days the animals of the first groups (controls) received a balanced diet according to AIN93M, the seconds - the same diet with Q added in a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight. Animals of the third groups received a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet (HFCD) with fat 30% by weight and with the replacement of drinking water with a 20% solution of fructose, the fourths groups - the same diet and supplementation with Q. After removing animals from the experiment, expression levels of liver carbohydrate and lipid metabolism genes Khk, Gck, Pklr, Acaca, Fasn, Scd, Srebf1, Mlxipl, Ppara and Pparg were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with reverse transcription using Actb and Gapdh as reference genes. The levels of triglycerides, total and HDL cholesterol, lipolytic activity and immunoreactive leptin were determined in plasma. . When comparing two animal lines, a significantly higher level of expression of Ppara, Pparg, Mlxipl, Acaca, Fasn, Scd was shown in Z rats compared to W rats, which is consistent with the development of dyslipidemia in the first ones and elevated levels of leptin under both types of diets used. The addition of Q caused in W rats a decrease in the expression of Scd, Mlxipl, Khk and Gck, more pronounced on the background of HFCD whereas in Z rats there were no similar effects, or they had the opposite direction. In addition, in Z rats, consumption of Q led to increased expression of Pklr, which was not observed in W rats. . The modulating effect of Q on the expression of key genes of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism enzymes significantly differs in wild-type W rats and mutant Z rats with hereditary obesity, and this difference appears to be potentiated by the consumption of excess fat and fructose.Copyright© GEOTAR-Media Publishing Group.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31257503>IDH2 compensates for IDH1 mutation to maintain cell survival under hypoxic conditions in IDH1‑mutant tumor cells.</a></h2><p>Mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and  occur in low‑grade gliomas, acute myeloid leukemias and other types of solid cancer.

IDH1 and  mutations result in the loss of normal catalytic function and acquire neomorphic activity, facilitating the conversion of α‑KG into an oncometabolite, (R)‑‑hydroxyglutarate, which can cause epigenetic modifications and tumorigenesis. Small‑molecule inhibitors of mutant IDH1 and  have been developed, and ongoing clinical trials have shown promising results in hematological malignancies, but not in gliomas. These previous findings make it necessary to identify the mechanism and develop more effective therapies for IDH1‑mutant gliomas. In the present study, it was demonstrated that under hypoxic conditions, patient‑derived primary glioma cells and HCT116 cells, both of which carry a monoallelic IDH1 arginine 132 to histidine mutation (R132H), have a slower growth rate than the corresponding wild‑type IDH1 cells. Western blot analysis showed that IDH1 R132H‑mutant cancer cells exhibited upregulated IDH2 protein expression under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, the silencing of IDH2 using small interfering RNA significantly inhibited the growth of IDH1‑mutant cells under hypoxic conditions. Finally, [U‑13C5]glutamine tracer analysis showed that IDH2 knockdown reduced the reductive carboxylation of α‑KG into isocitrate in HCT116R132H/+ cells under hypoxic conditions. The present study showed for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that IDH2 plays a compensatory role in maintaining reductive carboxylation‑dependent  and proliferation in IDH1 R132H tumor cells.

The closely related protein kinase D (PKD) isoforms act as effectors for DAG and PKC. Here, we showed that PKD3 was the predominant PKD isoform expressed in hepatocytes and was activated by lipid overload. PKD3 suppressed the activity of downstream insulin effectors including the kinase AKT and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 and  (mTORC1 and mTORC2). Hepatic deletion of PKD3 in mice improved insulin-induced glucose tolerance. However, increased insulin signaling in the absence of PKD3 promoted  mediated by SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein) and consequently increased triglyceride and cholesterol content in the livers of PKD3-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet. Conversely, hepatic-specific overexpression of a constitutively active PKD3 mutant suppressed insulin-induced signaling and caused insulin resistance. Our results indicate that PKD3 provides feedback on hepatic lipid production and suppresses insulin signaling. Therefore, manipulation of PKD3 activity could be used to decrease hepatic lipid content or improve hepatic insulin sensitivity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Here we identify host cell factor 1 (HCF-1) as a previously unknown ChREBP-interacting protein that is enriched in liver biopsies of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients. Biochemical and genetic studies show that HCF-1 is O-GlcNAcylated in response to glucose as a prerequisite for its binding to ChREBP and subsequent recruitment of OGT, ChREBP O-GlcNAcylation, and activation. The HCF-1:ChREBP complex resides at lipogenic gene promoters, where HCF-1 regulates H3K4 trimethylation to prime recruitment of the Jumonji C domain-containing histone demethylase PHF2 for epigenetic activation of these promoters.

Radiated (n=10) and non-radiated (n=10) fat pads received a single intra-mammary injection of a sham injection or peptide NP-110. Skin changes were examined clinically. Mammary fat pad tissue was processed for fibrotic and adipogenic markers using QPCR and immunohistochemistry.Clinical assessments and molecular analysis confirmed radiation-induced acute skin changes and radiation-induced fibrosis in rat mammary fat pads. Peptide treatment reduced fibrosis as detected by polarized microscopy of picrosirius red staining, increased collagen 3:1 ratio, reduced expression of collagen-1 crosslinking enzymes lysyl-oxidase, transglutaminase  and TGFβ1 protein m and increased adiponectin, an anti-fibrotic adipokine.

In this study, homology model of S1P was created in order to understand the structural basis for S1P inhibition by PF429242 using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation and in silico kinetics studies. PF429242 was docked (GlideScore=-5.20 kcal/mol) into the catalytic triad (D218, H249 and S414) and validated (R=0.5686). The reversible binding kinetic parameter (K/K) was estimated at=7.28E- M with fully bound and apo-states interspersed by 3 transient ligand-bound states with unique binding signatures; water plays a major role in PF429242 dissociation from the catalytic site. Communication between key catalytic triad residues is altered in the presence of PF429242. In apo-S1P state, S414-S307/V216-D218 is the preferred route but in PF429242-bound state, S414-S417/V216-D218 is preferred. Communication between S414 and H249 is also shortened in PF429242 bound state; here, only L410 is required unlike apo-state, which requires P418, V256 and F252. Ligand binding did not alter the communication route between S414 and H249 as both recruited D244 and G220.

These osteoporotic conditions are associated with oxidative stress and hyperglycemia which are both considered as critical factors underlying bone fragility. Glucose excess and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to favor  over osteoblastogenesis. In this study, we investigated whether high glucose exposure could determine dysfunction of mature BMAds, specifically through ROS production. The effects of low (LG, 5 mM) or high glucose (HG, 25 mM) concentrations were examined using human bone mesenchymal stromal cells (hBMSCs) in the time course of differentiation, and, up to 21 days once adipocytes were mature. HG did not alter the adipocyte differentiation process of hBMSCs. Yet, after 21 days under HG exposure, , and adiponectin mRNA expressions were decreased. These alterations were also observed following adipogenic inducer withdrawal as well as in adipocytes fully differentiated in LG then cultured in HG for the last 11 days. Without inducers, HG condition also led to decreased leptin mRNA level. Importantly, intracellular and extracellular ROS concentrations measured using Amplex Red were significantly raised by 50% under HG exposure. This rise was observed once adipocytes ended differentiation and was reproduced within the different cell culture settings without any cytotoxicity. Among genes involved in ROS metabolism, the mRNA level of the HO generating enzyme NOX4 was found upregulated in the presence of HG. Following cell separation, mature BMAds were shown to overproduce ROS and to display the gene alterations in contrast to non-lipid-laden cells. Finally, a non-lethal treatment with a pro-oxidant agent under LG condition reduces the mRNA levels of , adiponectin, and leptin as the HG condition does in the absence of inducers, and amplifies the effect of glucose excess on gene expression. HG concentration drives mature BMAds toward altered expression of the main adipokines and transcriptional factors. These perturbations are associated with a rise in ROS generation likely mediated through enhanced expression of . Mature BMAds are thus responsive to changes in glucose and ROS concentrations, which is relevant regarding with their phenotype and function in age- or metabolic disease-related osteoporosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31382089>Effects of photoperiod on growth, lipid metabolism and oxidative stress of juvenile gibel carp (Carassius auratus).</a></h2><p>A 58-day cultivation experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of photoperiods on growth, lipid metabolism and oxidative stress of juvenile gibel carp.

The light intensity was 1.02 μmol·m·s (at the tank bottom in a 0.5-m water depth). The fish were fed to satiety three times daily (8:30, 14:30 and 18:30). At the end of the experiment, final body weight, specific growth rate, feed efficiency and feed intake were significantly higher in 16L:8D, 20L:4D and 24L:0D groups than those in other groups (P < 0.05). Long-day photoperiods (16L:8D, 20L:4D and 24L:0D) simultaneously promoted , lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. The increases in lipid retention efficiency, whole body lipid concentration and liver lipid content (P < 0.05) indicated that  exceeded fatty acid oxidation. Liver oxidative stress was induced in juvenile gibel carp by short day lengths. The hepatic total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and the contents of metabolite glutathione were the highest in the short-day-length groups (0L:24D, 4L:20D and 8L:16D) (P < 0.05). Based on the growth performance and health status in the long-term cultivation experiment, the optimal photoperiods were 16L:8D, 20L:4D and 24L:0D in juvenile gibel carp.Copyright © 2019.

However, the effective therapy to prevent and treat obesity and overweight, up to now, cannot be found nowadays. Several methods/medicines namely diet control, energy balance, environmental changes, genetic and stem cell therapies, new drugs/chemicals have been extensively studied to enhance the ability to control bodyweight and prevent obesity. Of all the aforementioned methods, green tea, used as a daily beverage, has shown beneficial impacts for the health, especially its anti-obesity effects. Available evidence shows that green tea can interrupt lipid emulsification, reduce adipocyte differentiation, increase thermogenesis, and reduce food intake, thus green tea improves the systemic metabolism and decreases fat mass. Here, we highlight and sum up the update investigations of anti-obesity effect of green tea as well as discuss the potential application of them for preventing obesity and its related metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2019 Diabetes India.

Angiogenic factors have been linked to obesity, yet little is known about their expression during early childhood. To identify associations of angiogenic factors with characteristics on individual and tissue level, subcutaneous white adipose tissue samples were taken from 45 children aged 0-9 years undergoing elective surgery. We measured the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEFGA), fibroblast growth factor 1 and  (FGF1, FGF2), angiopoietin 1 and  (ANGPT1, ANGPT2), TEK receptor tyrosine kinase (TEK), and von Willebrand factor (VWF). In addition, we determined the mean adipocyte size in histologic tissue sections. We found positive correlations of age with FGF1 and FGF2 and a negative correlation with ANGPT2, with pronounced differences in the first two years of life. FGF1, FGF2, and ANGPT1 correlated positively with adipocyte size. Furthermore, we identified a correlation of ANGPT1 and TEK with body mass index-standard deviation score (BMI-SDS), a measure to define childhood obesity. Except for ANGPT2, all angiogenic factors correlated positively with the endothelial marker VWF. In sum, our findings suggest that differences related to BMI-SDS begin early in childhood, and the analyzed angiogenic factors possess distinct roles in adipose tissue biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451060>mA mRNA methylation controls autophagy and  by targeting  and .</a></h2><p>-methyladenosine (mA), the most abundant internal modification on mRNAs in eukaryotes, play roles in .

Binding of double-stranded DNA to AIM2 forms the AIM2 inflammasome, leading to activation of caspase-1 and production of IL-1β and IL-18. Although inflammasome-independent effects of AIM2 have been reported, its role in energy metabolism is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the effect of AIM2 in energy metabolism and glucose homeostasis.Male and female whole body Aim2 knockout (Aim2) mice were used in the current study. Body weight, food intake, body composition, energy expenditure, fasting blood glucose levels, GTT and body temperature were measured at indicated time points. RNA sequencing was carried out on gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) in 14-month-old female mice. mRNA and protein levels in tissues were analysed by quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblot. Immune cell infiltration in gWAT was examined by flow cytometry. Stromal vascular fractions isolated from gWAT were used to investigate adipocyte differentiation.Male and female Aim2 mice were obese compared with wild-type controls from 7 weeks of age until 51 weeks of age, with increased adiposity in both subcutaneous and visceral fat depots. While there were no differences in food intake, Aim2 mice demonstrated decreased energy expenditure and impaired brown adipose tissue function compared with wild-type controls. Fasting glucose and insulin levels were elevated, and Aim2 mice were glucose intolerant on intraperitoneal GTT. RNA sequencing revealed marked upregulation of the IFN-inducible gene Ifi202b, which encodes protein 202 (p202) and elevated inflammatory signalling in gWAT of Aim2 mice. Increased infiltration of total and Ly6C monocytes was noted at 8 weeks of age in gWAT, before the onset of obesity and insulin resistance. Ifi202b knockdown blocked  in stromal vascular fractions and reduced inflammation in bone marrow-derived macrophages, demonstrating a key role of p202 in mediating the increased  and inflammation in Aim2 mice.These results demonstrate a fundamental role for AIM2 in energy metabolism, inflammation and insulin resistance.

Gpr56 transcripts are differentially expressed in 3T3-L1 cells during . Transient knockdown (KD) of Gpr56 in 3T3-L1 cells dramatically inhibits differentiation through reducing the accumulation of both neutral cellular lipids (56%) and production of established  Pparγ  (60-80%), C/ebpα (40-78%) mediator, and Ap2 (56-80%) marker proteins. Furthermore, genome editing of Gpr56 in 3T3-L1 cells created CW2..4 and RM4..5.5 clones (Gpr56  cells) with compound heterozygous deletion frameshift mutations which abolish . Genome edited cells have sustained levels of the  inhibitor β-catenin, reduced proliferation, reduced adhesion, altered profiles, and or abundance of extracellular matrix component gene transcripts for fibronectin, types I, III, and IV collagens and loss of actin stress fibers. β-catenin KD alone is insufficient to restore  in Gpr56  cells.

ELOVL fatty acid elongase 6 (Elovl6) is responsible for converting C16 saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (FAs) into C18 species. We have previously shown that Elovl6 contributes to obesity-induced insulin resistance by modifying hepatic C16/C18-related FA composition. To define the precise molecular mechanism by which hepatic Elovl6 affects energy homeostasis and metabolic disease, we generated liver-specific Elovl6 knockout (LKO) mice. Unexpectedly, LKO mice were not protected from high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance. Instead, LKO mice exhibited higher insulin sensitivity than controls when consuming a high-sucrose diet (HSD), which induces . Hepatic patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (Pnpla3) expression was downregulated in LKO mice, and adenoviral Pnpla3 restoration reversed the enhancement in insulin sensitivity in HSD-fed LKO mice. Lipidomic analyzes showed that the hepatic ceramide(d18:1/18:0) content was lower in LKO mice, which may explain the effect on insulin sensitivity. Ceramide(d18:1/18:0) enhances protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity by interfering with the binding of PP2A to its biological inhibitor I2PP2A, leading to Akt dephosphorylation. Its production involves the formation of an Elovl6-ceramide synthase 4 (CerS4) complex in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and a Pnpla3-CerS4 complex on lipid droplets (LDs). Consistent with this, liver-specific Elovl6 deletion in ob/ob mice reduced both hepatic ceramide(d18:1/18:0) and PP2A activity, and ameliorated insulin resistance. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates the key role of hepatic Elovl6 in the regulation of the acyl-chain composition of ceramide, and that C18:0-ceramide is a potent regulator of hepatic insulin signaling linked to Pnpla3-mediated NAFLD.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31225456>Attenuating MKRN1 E3 ligase-mediated AMPKα suppression increases tolerance against metabolic stresses in mice.</a></h2><p>The 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an essential energy sensor in the cell, which, at low energy levels, instigates the cellular energy-generating systems along with suppression of the anabolic signaling pathways. The activation of AMPK through phosphorylation is a well-known process; however, activation alone is not sufficient, and knowledge about the other regulatory networks of post-translational modifications connecting the activities of AMPK to systemic metabolic syndromes is important, which is still lacking. The recent studies on Makorin Ring Finger Protein 1 (MKRN1) mediating the ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of AMPK( implicate that the post-translational modification of AMPK, regulating its protein homeostasis, could impose significant systemic metabolic effects (Lee . Nat Commun 9:3404). In this study, MKRN1 was identified as a novel E3 ligase for both AMPKα1 and α. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts, genetically deleted for , and  and , became stabilized with the suppression of  pathways and an increase in nutrient consumption and mitochondria regeneration. Of note, the  knockout mice fed normal chow displayed no obvious phenotypic defects or abnormality, whereas the -null mice exhibited strong tolerance to metabolic stresses induced by high-fat diet (HFD). Thus, these mice, when compared with the HFD-induced wild type, were resistant to obesity, diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Interestingly, in whole-body  knockout mouse, only the liver and white and brown adipose tissues displayed anincrease in the active phosphorylated AMPK levels, but no other organs, such as the hypothalamus, skeletal muscles, or pancreas, displayed such increases. Specific ablation of MKRN1 in the mouse liver using adenovirus prevented HFD-induced lipid accumulation in the liver and blood, implicating MKRN1 as a possible therapeutic target for metabolic syndromes, such as obesity, type II diabetes, and fat liver diseases. This study would provide a crucial perspective on the importance of post-translational regulation of AMPK in metabolic pathways and will help researchers develop novel therapeutic strategies that target not only AMPK but also its regulators.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31260678>Effects of short-term prednisolone treatment on indices of lipolysis and lipase signaling in abdominal adipose tissue in healthy humans.</a></h2><p>Glucocorticoid (GC) excess increases lipolysis, circulating free fatty acid concentrations and lipid oxidation rates in humans. In vitro and animal studies have shown that GCs increase adipocyte ATGL and HSL mRNA contents and HSL phosphorylations, but the effects of GC on in vivo lipase signaling in humans are uncertain. Our study was designed to test how GC administration affects ATGL and HSL related signals in human adipose tissue.Nine healthy young men underwent 5 days administration of 37.5 mg prednisolone/d in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover design. At the end of each 5 d period the subjects were studied after an overnight fast for 6.5 h including a basal period and a ½ h hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Adipose tissue biopsies were sampled from the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue at the end of the basal period and the clamp.GC treatment increased serum FFA concentrations and comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58) mRNA - an ATGL activator - and decreased G0/G1 switch  gene (G0S2) mRNA - an ATGL inhibitor - in adipose tissue biopsies. In addition, pro-lipolytic ser HSL phosphorylations and protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation of PLIN1 (Perilipin-1) increased. The transcripts of ANGPTL4 (Angiopoietin-like 4) mRNA - a regulator of circulating triglycerides - were elevated by GC; as were CIDE (Cell-death Inducing DNA fragmentation factor-α-like Effector)-A and CIDE-C mRNA transcripts indicative of concurrent stimulation of lipolysis and . Finally GCs reduced insulin receptor phosphorylation, and Akt protein levels.High dose GC administration to humans leads to pro-lipolytic alterations of CGI-58, G0S2 and ANGPTL4 mRNA transcripts, increases PKA signaling to lipolysis and inhibits the insulin signal in adipose tissue. The increased CIDE-A and CIDE-C mRNA levels suggest concomitant stimulation of lipolysis and lipid storage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

NAFLD covers a spectrum that ranges from simple steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with varying degrees of fibrosis, to cirrhosis, which is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. Lifestyle and eating habit changes during the last century have made NAFLD the most common liver disease linked to obesity, type  diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia, with a global prevalence of 25%. NAFLD arises when the uptake of fatty acids (FA) and triglycerides (TG) from circulation and de novo  saturate the rate of FA β-oxidation and very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG export. Deranged lipid metabolism is also associated with NAFLD progression from steatosis to NASH, and therefore, alterations in liver and serum lipidomic signatures are good indicators of the disease's development and progression. This review focuses on the importance of the classification of NAFLD patients into different subtypes, corresponding to the main alteration(s) in the major pathways that regulate FA homeostasis leading, in each case, to the initiation and progression of NASH.

The obesity epidemic demands interventions to reverse obesity-associated hepatic steatosis, NAFLD, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and several new pharmacologic approaches have been developed within the past several years. Steatosis develops when energy delivery to the liver, modulated by rates of hepatic , exceeds the capacity of the liver to utilize or export this energy. Therefore, pharmacologic approaches to reverse hepatic steatosis have focused largely, though not exclusively, on (1) reducing substrate availability to the liver, () reducing hepatic lipid synthesis, and (3) increasing hepatic mitochondrial fat oxidation (Figure 1).

The expression of , a  gene copy, partially compensates for  disruption due to exon-7 excision in 90% of transcripts subsequently explaining the strong clinical heterogeneity. Several alterations in energy metabolism, like glucose intolerance and hyperlipidemia, have been reported in SMA at both systemic and cellular level, prompting questions about the potential role of energy homeostasis and/or production involvement in disease progression. In this context, we have recently reported the tolerance of mild SMA-like mice ( ) to 10 months of low-intensity running or high-intensity swimming exercise programs, respectively involving aerobic and a mix aerobic/anaerobic muscular metabolic pathways. Here, we investigated whether those exercise-induced benefits were associated with an improvement in metabolic status in mild SMA-like mice. We showed that untrained SMA-like mice exhibited a dysregulation of lipid metabolism with an enhancement of  and adipocyte deposits when compared to control mice. Moreover, they displayed a high oxygen consumption and energy expenditure through β-oxidation increase yet for the same levels of spontaneous activity. Interestingly, both exercises significantly improved lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis in SMA-like mice, and enhanced oxygen consumption efficiency with the maintenance of a high oxygen consumption for higher levels of spontaneous activity. Surprisingly, more significant effects were obtained with the high-intensity swimming protocol with the maintenance of high lipid oxidation. Finally, when combining electron microscopy, respiratory chain complexes expression and enzymatic activity measurements in muscle mitochondria, we found that (1) a muscle-specific decreased in enzymatic activity of respiratory chain I, II, and IV complexes for equal amount of mitochondria and complexes expression and () a significant decline in mitochondrial maximal oxygen consumption, were reduced by both exercise programs.

Bacterial supernatants secreted from diverse periodontal bacteria induce the production of cytokines that contribute to local periodontal tissue destruction. However, little is known about the impact of whole bacterial toxins on the biological behavior of PDLSC. Therefore this study investigated whether proliferation, migration, inflammatory cytokines expression and transcriptional profile would be affected by exposure to endotoxins from bacterial species found in the subgingival plaque. PDLSC were cultured with the following bacterial supernatants: S. mutans, S. anginosus, P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis and T. denticola. These supernatants were prepared in dilutions of 1:1000, 1:500, 1:300 and 1:50. Using quantitative RT-PCR, gene expression of selected inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1β) and cell-surface receptors (TLR2, TLR4) showed upregulation of ≈.0- to 3.0-fold, when exposed to P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis and T. denticola. However, supernatants did not affect proliferation (MTT) and migration (wound scratch assays) of PDLSC. Next generation RNA sequencing confirmed modified lineage commitment of PDLSC by stimulating chondrogenesis,  and inhibition of osteogenesis under P. gingivalis supernatant treatment compared to control. Taken together, this study shows stem cell immunomodulatory response to different periodontal bacteria supernatant and suggests that stem cell transcriptional capacity, migration/proliferation and osteogenesis may differ in the presence of those pathogens.

Thirty six Sprague Dawley rats were divided into T1DM group (diabetic rats), control group (vehicle treatment), and T1DM-Zinc group (diabetic rats administered zinc sulfate 0.25 mg/kg by oral gavage). The bone histomorphological parameters, serum bone metabolism markers (including ALP, OPG, RUNX , and RANKL), BMD, and bone marrow adipocyte numbers were detected after eight weeks of zinc sulfate treatment. The results showed zinc sulfate administration (0.25 mg/kg/d) decreased blood glucose, increased the BMD, decreased serum ALP, and RANKL, increased serum OPG and RUNX  levels, as well as OPG/RANKL ratio of T1DM rats. Meanwhile, the bone histomorphological parameters, bone marrow adipocytes numbers were returned to be normal. The RUNX , and OPG mRNA expression levels in bone tissues of T1DM-Zinc group rats were increased after zinc sulfate treatment compared with the diabetic rats (P < 0.05). Those indicating that zinc sulfate can prevent DOP, the protective mechanism were mainly related to its hypoglycemic effect, bone marrow  inhibition effect, OPG/RANKL ratio and RUNX  up-regulation effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557715>Detailed Functional Characterization of a Waist-Hip Ratio Locus in 7p15. Defines an Enhancer Controlling Adipocyte Differentiation.</a></h2><p>We combined CAGE sequencing in human adipocytes during differentiation with data from genome-wide association studies to identify an enhancer in the SNX10 locus on chromosome 7, presumably involved in body fat distribution. Using reporter assays and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in human cell lines, we characterized the role of the enhancer in . The enhancer was active during  and responded strongly to insulin and isoprenaline. The allele associated with increased waist-hip ratio in human genetic studies was associated with higher enhancer activity. Mutations of the enhancer resulted in less adipocyte differentiation. RNA sequencing of cells with disrupted enhancer showed reduced expression of established adipocyte markers, such as ADIPOQ and LPL, and identified CHI3L1 on chromosome 1 as a potential gene involved in adipocyte differentiation. In conclusion, we identified and characterized an enhancer in the SNX10 locus and outlined its plausible mechanisms of action and downstream targets.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Tg6 mice with chronic erythropoietin overexpression have a high hematocrit, reduced trabecular and cortical bone and bone marrow adipocytes, and decreased bone morphogenic protein  driven ectopic bone and adipocyte formation. Erythropoietin treatment (1 200 IU·kg) for 10 days similarly exhibit increased hematocrit, reduced bone and bone marrow adipocytes without increased osteoclasts, and reduced bone morphogenic protein signaling in the bone marrow. Interestingly, endogenous erythropoietin is required for normal differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells to osteoblasts and bone marrow adipocytes. ΔEpoR mice with erythroid restricted erythropoietin receptor exhibit reduced trabecular bone, increased bone marrow adipocytes, and decreased bone morphogenic protein  ectopic bone formation. Erythropoietin treated ΔEpoR mice achieved hematocrit similar to wild-type mice without reduced bone, suggesting that bone reduction with erythropoietin treatment is associated with non-erythropoietic erythropoietin response. Bone marrow stromal cells from wild-type, Tg6, and ΔEpoR-mice were transplanted into immunodeficient mice to assess development into a bone/marrow organ. Like endogenous bone formation, Tg6 bone marrow cells exhibited reduced differentiation to bone and adipocytes indicating that high erythropoietin inhibits osteogenesis and , while ΔEpoR bone marrow cells formed ectopic bones with reduced trabecular regions and increased adipocytes, indicating that loss of erythropoietin signaling favors  at the expense of osteogenesis. In summary, endogenous erythropoietin signaling regulates bone marrow stromal cell fate and aberrant erythropoietin levels result in their impaired differentiation.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31382826>Fatty degeneration and wnt10b expression in the supraspinatus muscle after surgical repair of torn rotator cuff tendon.</a></h2><p>In the torn rotator cuff muscles, decreased expression of wnt10b prior to elevation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) has previously been reported. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the expression profiles of these -related genes after rotator cuff detachment and reattachment in a rabbit model.We investigated gene expression profiles of PPARγ, C/EBPα, and wnt10b in different parts of rabbit supraspinatus (SSP) muscle after tendon detachment ( = 6 for each time point). In addition, we assessed expression of the same genes after SSP reattachment with different intervals from initial detachment ( = 6). Fatty degeneration of the SSP muscle was examined by Oil red-O staining. Gene expression profiles were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.After SSP detachment, Oil red-O-positive oil deposits increased after 3 weeks. In the SSP reattachment model, numerous Oil red-O-positive cells were present at 5-week reattachment, following - and 3-week detachment. PPARγ and C/EBPα messenger ribonucleic acid expression exhibited a significant increase at  and 3 weeks after SSP detachment and remained increased at 5-week reattachment after - and 3-week detachment. A decreased expression of wnt10b was observed from 1 week after SSP detachment. Expression of wnt10b was recovered not in the central area of the SSP muscle but in the periphery after reattachment. Adipogenic change was not observed when SSP tendon was reattached after 1-week detachment.These results may suggest that once the adipogenic transcription factors, PPARγ and C/EBPα, were elevated, repair surgery after rotator cuff tear could not prevent the emergence of fat in the SSP muscle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31393485>Anthocyanin-rich extract from black rice (Oryza sativa L.

Although anthocyanin-rich extract from black rice (AEBR) was reported to have a beneficial effect on diabetic rats, no studies have been performed on whether black rice anthocyanins are beneficial for diabetic osteoporosis. Therefore, in this study, a streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat model was established to investigate the protective effect of AEBR on diabetes-induced osteoporosis and its possible mechanism. AEBR at three doses (0.5, 1.0, and .0 g kg d) were administered by oral gavage to diabetic rats for 8 weeks. The blood glucose, BMD, bone histomorphometry parameters, serum bone turnover biomarkers, bone marrow adipocyte numbers, as well as osteoprotegerin (OPG), runt-related transcription factor  (RUNX ), and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κ B ligand (RANKL) protein expression in bone and serum were detected. The results indicated that AEBR dose-dependently decreased the blood glucose, increased the BMD, and decreased the serum bone turnover markers. The bone microstructure and osteoclast numbers in bone tissues returned to normal in the high AEBR dosage group; at the same time, the AEBR dose-dependently suppressed bone marrow . The RUNX  as well as the OPG/RANKL ratio in diabetic rats' bone tissues increased significantly in the AEBR treatment group. Our results indicate that AEBR administration can ameliorate bone loss caused by diabetes; this is mainly attributed to its inhibition of bone turnover, suppression of bone marrow , and up-regulation of RUNX  and the OPG/RANKL expression ratio.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594827>Distinct Gut Microbiota Induced by Different Fat-to-Sugar-Ratio High-Energy Diets Share Similar Pro-obesity Genetic and Metabolite Profiles in Prediabetic Mice.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota play important roles in host metabolism, especially in diabetes. However, why different diets lead to similar diabetic states despite being associated with different microbiota is not clear. Mice were fed two high-energy diets (HED) with the same energy density but different fat-to-sugar ratios to determine the associations between the microbiota and early-stage metabolic syndrome. The two diets resulted in different microbiota but similar diabetic states. Interestingly, the microbial gene profiles were not significantly different, and many common metabolites were identified, including l-aspartic acid, cholestan-3-ol (5β, 3α), and campesterol, which have been associated with  and inflammation. Our study suggests that different metabolic-syndrome-inducing diets may result in different microbiota but similar microbiomes and metabolomes. This suggests that the metagenome and metabolome are crucial for the prognosis and pathogenesis of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Various types of diet can lead to type  diabetes. The gut microbiota in type  diabetic patients are also different. So, two questions arise: whether there are any commonalities between gut microbiota induced by different pro-obese diets and whether these commonalities lead to disease. Here we found that high-energy diets with two different fat-to-sugar ratios can both cause obesity and prediabetes but enrich different gut microbiota. Still, these different gut microbiota have similar genetic and metabolite compositions. The microbial metabolites in common between the diets modulate lipid accumulation and macrophage inflammation  and  This work suggests that studies that only use 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to determine how the microbes respond to diet and associate with diabetic state are missing vital information.Copyright © 2019 Shan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31526501>Pyridocarbazole alkaloids from Ochrosia borbonica: lipid-lowering agents inhibit the cell proliferation and  of 3T3-L1 adipocyte via intercalating into supercoiled DNA.</a></h2><p>Bioassay-guided fractionation of an ethanolic extract of Ochrosia borbonica led to the isolation of two known pyridocarbazole alkaloids, ellipticine (1) and 9-methoxyellipticine (), and six known monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (3-8).

BMSCs with activated and inactivated LATS2 were constructed with lentiviral vectors transfections. The BMSCs were allocated to blank control group (MSC group), empty vector control group (MSC-eGFP group), LATS2-overexpressing group (MSC-LATS2 group), empty vector without LATS2 shRNA control group (MSC-shcontrol group) and LATS2-underexpressing group (MSC-shLATS2 group). The transduction efficiencies mediated by the lentiviral vectors were evaluated by flow cytometry. The mRNA and protein expressions of LATS2, phosphorylation of Yes associated protein (p-YAP) and 14-3-3 were quantified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western Blot respectively. Osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs were evaluated through alizarin red and oil red O staining. Proliferation of BMSCs was evaluated using the CCK-8 assay. The effect of Hippo pathway on horizontal and vertical migration ability of BMSCs was measured by the scratch test and Transwell chamber test.The transduction efficiencies mediated by the lentiviral vectors were 93.1%-97.1%. Compared with MSC-eGFP group, the expressions of LATS2, p-YAP and 14-3-3 in MSC-LATS2 group were significantly elevated [LATS2 mRNA (): .55±0.13 vs. 1.08±0.05, LATS2/GAPDH: .63±0.11 vs. 1.06±0.08, p-YAP/total YAP: 1.67±0.11 vs. 1.00±0.04, 14-3-3/β-actin: .22±0.20 vs. 0.98±0.06, all P < 0.05], however, compared with MSC-shcontrol group, the expressions in MSC-shLATS2 group were significantly reduced [LATS2 mRNA (): 0.10±0.01 vs. 1.01±0.05, LATS2/GAPDH: 0.09±0.01 vs. 1.05±0.06, p-YAP/total YAP: 0.10±0.02 vs. 1.10±0.09, 14-3-3/β-actin: 0.05±0.01 vs. 0.90±0.08, all P < 0.05]. It suggested that high and low expression of LATS2 could activate or inhibit Hippo pathway. The osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation and proliferation rate of BMSCs in MSC-LATS2 group were significantly lower than those in MSC-eGFP group, however, those in MSC-shLATS2 group were significantly higher than MSC-shontrol group (all P < 0.05). It suggested that high and low expression of LATS2 could inhibit or promote osteogenesis,  and cell proliferation of BMSCs. Scratch test and Transwell chamber test showed that the degree of scratch healing in MSC-LATS2 group was significantly lower than that in MSC-eGFP group [(22.11±3.02)% vs. (45.99±6.58)%], while the number of cells migrating to the subventricular layer of Transwell was significantly reduced (cells/MP: 20.82±3.05 vs. 111.33±13.28, both P < 0.05); the degree of scratch healing in MSC-shLATS2 group was significantly higher than that in MSC-shcontrol group [(70.32±7.17)% vs. (39.28±.98)%], the number of cells migrating to the subventricular layer of Transwell was increased significantly (cells/MP: 206.19±30.58 vs. 120.10±25.10, both P < 0.05).

C57BL/6J mice were fed a normal diet and HFD supplemented or not (n = 8) with SSPS (.5%), genistein (0.5%) and their mixture (S + G) for 12 weeks. The UPLC-qTOP/MS assay showed that SSPS observably enhanced the urinary concentration of genistein and its metabolites compared to that of single genistein in mice. Supplementation of SSPS, genistein or their combination prevented HFD-induced gain weight, dyslipidemia, oxidative stress and inflammation in obese mice. Interestingly, the combined S + G ingestion exhibited more effective alleviation of dyslipidemia by modulating hepatic FAS, ACC, SREBP-1C and ADRP expressions relative to that of individual SSPS or genistein. Furthermore, S + G activated the energy metabolism pathway AMPK in the liver, and the hepatic PPAR-α/PPAR-γ pathways were doubly activated to alleviate , inflammation, obesity and metabolic syndrome. Moreover, S + G supplementation dramatically modified the gut microbial species at the phylum level with a decrease in Firmicutes and increase in Bacteroidetes.

Placental growth factor is a potent proangiogenic factor that stimulates the formation of mature and durable vessels but is understudied in human diseases. Methods and Results We conducted a prospective case-cohort study of baseline placental growth factor and incident T2DM within the WHS (Women's Health Study). A random sample of incident T2DM cases (n=491) occurring over a 15-year follow-up period was selected and compared with a reference subcohort (n=561). Case subjects were matched to the reference risk set on 5-year age groups and race. All subjects in this analysis were required to have a hemoglobin A <6.5% at WHS enrollment. Median baseline levels of placental growth factor were higher in case subjects compare to the reference subcohort (18.0 pg/mL versus 17. pg/mL) but were only weakly correlated with glycemic measures and not associated with obesity. The risk of diabetes mellitus increased across placental growth factor quartile in the base model (hazard ratios, 1.00, 1.14, 1.46, and .14; P-trend<0.001) and in multivariable-adjusted models accounting for clinical T2DM risk factors (hazard ratios, 1.00, 1.17, 1.45, and .61; P-trend<0.001). These findings were not substantially altered by further adjustment for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, hemoglobin A, or fasting insulin and remained robust in sensitivity analyses excluding those diagnosed within  years of enrollment and those with baseline hemoglobin A ≥6.0%. Conclusions Elevated placental growth factor levels are associated with future T2DM independent of traditional risk factors, measures of glycemia, insulin resistance, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. These prospective data suggest that pathologic angiogenesis may occur well before the clinical onset of T2DM and thus may have relevance to vascular complications of this disease.

It is well known that insulin resistance, especially hepatic insulin resistance, is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Current research has shown that hepatic fatty acid accumulation can cause hepatic insulin resistance through increased gluconeogenesis, , chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired insulin signal pathway. Mitochondria are the major sites of fatty acid β-oxidation, which is the major degradation mechanism of fatty acids. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic fatty acid-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged mitochondria to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to inhibit hepatic fatty acid accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and hepatic insulin resistance. Additionally, we also highlight the potential value of mitophagy in the treatment of hepatic insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 Su, Nie, Huang, Zhu, Feng, Tang and Zheng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31368568>Phenolic components rich ethyl acetate fraction of Orostachys japonicus inhibits lipid accumulation by regulating reactive oxygen species generation in .</a></h2><p>In this study, Orostachys japonicus was extracted with ethyl alcohol and fractionated by a serial of organic solvents.

This is due in part to the limited capacity of VIS fat to buffer lipids allowing them to deposit in insulin-sensitive tissues. Mechanisms underlying selective hypertrophic growth and tissue remodeling properties of VIS fat are not well understood. We identified subsets of adipose progenitors (APs) unique to VIS fat with differential Cd34 expression and adipogenic capacity.

This has made these adult cells, collectively called  (MSCs), strong candidates for fields such as tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Based on evidence from in vivo genetic lineage-tracing studies, pericytes have been identified as a source of MSC precursors in vivo in multiple organs, in response to injury or during homeostasis. Questions of intense debate and interest in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative studies include the following: 1) Are all pericytes, irrespective of tissue of isolation, equal in their differentiation potential? ) What are the mechanisms that regulate the differentiation of MSCs? To gain a better understanding of the latter, recent work has utilized ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) to reconstruct histone landscapes. This indicated that for dental pulp pericytes, the odontoblast-specific gene  was found in a transcriptionally permissive state, while in bone marrow pericytes, the osteoblast-specific gene  was primed for expression.

Yet, it is unknown whether sFRP4 action contributes to the development of these pathologies. Here, we determined whether sFRP4 expression in visceral fat associates with NAFLD and whether it directly interferes with insulin action and lipid and glucose metabolism in primary hepatocytes and myotubes. The association of sFRP4 with clinical measures was investigated in obese men with or without type  diabetes and with or without biopsy-proven NAFLD. To determine the impact of sFRP4 on metabolic parameters, primary human myotubes (hSkMC), or primary hepatocytes from metabolic healthy C57Bl6 and from systemic insulin-resistant mice, i.e. aP2-SREBP-1c, were used. Gene expression of sFRP4 in visceral fat from obese men associated with insulin sensitivity, triglycerides and NAFLD. In C57Bl6 hepatocytes, sFRP4 disturbed insulin action. Specifically, sFRP4 decreased the abundance of IRS1 and FoxO1 together with impaired insulin-mediated activation of Akt-signalling and glycogen synthesis and a reduced suppression of gluconeogenesis by insulin. Moreover, sFRP4 enhanced insulin-stimulated hepatic de novo  (DNL). In hSkMC, sFRP4 induced glycolysis rather than inhibiting insulin signalling. Finally, in hepatocytes from aP2-SREBP-1c mice, sFRP4 potentiates existing insulin resistance. Collectively, we show that sFRP4 interferes with hepatocyte insulin action. Physiologically, sFRP4 promotes DNL in hepatocytes and glycolysis in myotubes. These sFRP4-mediated responses may result in a vicious cycle, in which enhanced rates of DNL and glycolysis aggravate hepatic lipid accumulation and insulin resistance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Immediate early genes (IEGs) are overexpressed in patients with active GO compared to healthy controls. The aim of this study was to study the effects of tobacco smoking and simvastatin on preadipocytes and orbital fibroblasts (OFs) in the adipogenic process.Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) was generated by a validated pump system. Mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes or OFs were exposed to 10% CSE with or without simvastatin.

Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) are the ideal source to study fat formation as they are the progenitors of adipocytes. In this work, we used human MSCs, received from surgery waste, and differentiated them into fat adipocytes. The combination of several layers of information coming from lipidomics, metabolomics and proteomics enabled network analysis of the biochemical pathways in . Simultaneous analysis of metabolites, lipids, and proteins in cell culture is challenging due to the compound's chemical difference, so most studies involve separate analysis with unimolecular strategies. In this study, we employed a multimolecular approach using a two-phase extraction to monitor the crosstalk between lipid metabolism and protein-based signaling in a single sample (~10 cells). We developed an innovative analytical workflow including standardization with in-house produced C isotopically labeled compounds, hyphenated high-end mass spectrometry (high-resolution Orbitrap MS), and chromatography (HILIC, RP) for simultaneous untargeted screening and targeted quantification. Metabolite and lipid concentrations ranged over three to four orders of magnitude and were detected down to the low fmol (absolute on column) level. Biological validation and data interpretation of the multiomics workflow was performed based on proteomics network reconstruction, metabolic modelling (MetaboAnalyst 4.0), and pathway analysis (OmicsNet). Comparing MSCs and adipocytes, we observed significant regulation of different metabolites and lipids such as triglycerides, gangliosides, and carnitine with 113 fully reprogrammed pathways. The observed changes are in accordance with literature findings dealing with adipogenic differentiation of MSC. These results are a proof of principle for the power of multimolecular extraction combined with orthogonal LC-MS assays and network construction. Considering the analytical and biological validation performed in this study, we conclude that the proposed multiomics workflow is ideally suited for comprehensive follow-up studies on  and is fit for purpose for different applications with a high potential to understand the complex pathophysiology of diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31351846>Molecular modelling, synthesis, and biological evaluations of a 3,5-disubstituted isoxazole fatty acid analogue as a PPARα-selective agonist.</a></h2><p>The peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) are important drug targets in treatment of metabolic and inflammatory disorders. Fibrates, acting as PPARα agonists, have been widely used lipid-lowering agents for decades. However, the currently available PPARα targeting agents show low subtype-specificity and consequently a search for more potent agonists have emerged. In this study, previously isolated oxohexadecenoic acids from the marine algae Chaetoceros karianus were used to design a PPARα-specific analogue. Herein we report the design, synthesis, molecular modelling studies and biological evaluations of the novel 3,5-disubstituted isoxazole analogue 6-(5-heptyl-1,-oxazol-3-yl)hexanoic acid (1), named ADAM. ADAM shows a clear receptor preference and significant dose-dependent activation of PPARα (EC = 47 µM) through its ligand-binding domain (LBD). Moreover, ADAM induces expression of important PPARα target genes, such as CPT1A, in the Huh7 cell line and primary mouse hepatocytes. In addition, ADAM exhibits a moderate ability to regulate PPARγ target genes and drive . Molecular modelling studies indicated that ADAM docks its carboxyl group into opposite ends of the PPARα and -γ LBD. ADAM interacts with the receptor-activating polar network of amino acids (Tyr501, His447 and Ser317) in PPARα, but not in PPARγ LBD. This may explain the lack of PPARγ agonism, and argues for a PPARα-dependent adipogenic function. Such compounds are of interest towards developing new lipid-lowering remedies.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Adipocytes predominantly utilize oxidative phosphorylation, whereas osteoblasts use glycolysis to meet ATP demand. Here, we compared progenitor differentiation from the marrow of two inbred mouse strains, C3H/HeJ (C3H) and C57BL6J (B6). These strains differ in both skeletal mass and bone marrow adiposity. We hypothesized that genetic regulation of metabolic programs controls skeletal stem cell fate. Our experiments identified Bcl--like protein 13 (Bcl2l13), a mitochondrial mitophagy receptor, as being critical for adipogenic differentiation. We also found that Bcl2l13 is differentially expressed in the two mouse strains, with C3H adipocyte progenitor differentiation being accompanied by a >-fold increase in Bcl2l13 levels relative to B6 marrow adipocytes. Bcl2l13 expression also increased during adipogenic differentiation in mouse ear mesenchymal stem cells (eMSCs) and the murine preadipocyte cell line 3T3-L1. The higher Bcl2l13 expression correlated with increased mitochondrial fusion and biogenesis. Importantly,  knockdown significantly impaired adipocyte differentiation in both 3T3-L1 cells and eMSCs. Mechanistically,  knockdown reprogrammed cells to rely more on glycolysis to meet ATP demand in the face of impaired oxidative phosphorylation.  knockdown in eMSCs increased mitophagy.

Developing effective strategies to prevent obesity is therefore of paramount importance. One potential strategy to reduce obesity is to consume calcium, which has been implicated to be involved in reducing body weight/fat. In this review, we compile the evidence for the anti-obesity roles of calcium in cells, animals, and humans. In addition, we summarize the possible anti-obesity mechanisms of calcium, including regulation of (a) , (b) fat metabolism, (c) adipocyte (precursor) proliferation and apoptosis, (d) thermogenesis, (e) fat absorption and excretion, and (f) gut microbiota. Although the exact anti-obesity roles of calcium in different subjects and how calcium induces the proposed anti-obesity mechanisms need to be further investigated, the current evidence demonstrates the anti-obesity effects of calcium and suggests the potential application of dietary calcium for prevention of obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31375660>Altered adipocyte differentiation and unbalanced autophagy in type  Familial Partial Lipodystrophy: an in vitro and in vivo study of adipose tissue browning.</a></h2><p>Type- Familial Partial Lipodystrophy is caused by LMNA mutations. Patients gradually lose subcutaneous fat from the limbs, while they accumulate adipose tissue in the face and neck. Several studies have demonstrated that autophagy is involved in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation and the maintenance of the balance between white and brown adipose tissue. We identified deregulation of autophagy in laminopathic preadipocytes before induction of differentiation. Moreover, in differentiating white adipocyte precursors, we observed impairment of large lipid droplet formation, altered regulation of adipose tissue genes, and expression of the brown adipose tissue marker UCP1. Conversely, in lipodystrophic brown adipocyte precursors induced to differentiate, we noticed activation of autophagy, formation of enlarged lipid droplets typical of white adipocytes, and dysregulation of brown adipose tissue genes. In agreement with these in vitro results indicating conversion of FPLD2 brown preadipocytes toward the white lineage, adipose tissue from FPLD2 patient neck, an area of brown , showed a white phenotype reminiscent of its brown origin. Moreover, in vivo morpho-functional evaluation of fat depots in the neck area of three FPLD2 patients by PET/CT analysis with cold stimulation showed the absence of brown adipose tissue activity. These findings highlight a new pathogenetic mechanism leading to improper fat distribution in lamin A-linked lipodystrophies and show that both impaired white adipocyte turnover and failure of adipose tissue browning contribute to disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31407244>Relationships between expression levels of genes related to  and adipocyte function in dogs.</a></h2><p>There are three kinds of adipocytes; white adipocytes accumulate excess energy as fat, whereas brown/beige adipocytes dissipate energy through expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Obesity, a feature of excess accumulation of white adipocytes in a body, is one of the risk factors for onset of various diseases in dogs. As the first step to explore adipose genes related to dog obesity, we examined relationships among mRNA levels of putative molecules related to  and function of adipocytes in fat of hospitalized dogs. Gonadal adipose tissues were collected from a total of 29 dogs, and the gene expression levels were examined by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The multicollinearity analysis revealed that body condition score (BCS), which reflects adiposity, did not correlate with expression levels of any genes but correlated with age of dog. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway stimulates not only commitment of mesenchymal stem cells to white adipocyte-lineage cells but also brown/beige . Some relationships between expression levels of BMP receptors were significant; especially, expression levels of activin receptor-like kinase (Alk) 3 (a BMP type I receptor) positively related to those of Alk2 (another BMP type I receptor), activin receptor type II (ActRII) A (a type II receptor to transmit BMP signal), ActRIIB (another type II receptor to transmit BMP signal) and BMP receptor type  (Bmpr2). PR domain containing 16 (Prdm16) expression levels strongly correlated with expression levels of ActRIIB. Although PRDM16 is known to stimulate brown/beige , expression levels of Ucp1 did not correlate with those of Prdm16. On the other hand, expression levels of Ucp1 correlated with those of Alk6. The present study suggests close relationships among adipose expressions of BMP signal components, and the relationships of expression levels of BMP receptor and those of Prdm16 or Ucp1 in dogs. Further studies using more dogs with various BCS potentially lead to identification of adipose factors to relate with adiposity in dogs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31577953>Calorie-Restriction-Induced Insulin Sensitivity Is Mediated by Adipose mTORC2 and Not Required for Lifespan Extension.</a></h2><p>Calorie restriction (CR) extends the healthspan and lifespan of diverse species. In mammals, a broadly conserved metabolic effect of CR is improved insulin sensitivity, which may mediate the beneficial effects of a CR diet. This model has been challenged by the identification of interventions that extend lifespan and healthspan yet promote insulin resistance. These include rapamycin, which extends mouse lifespan yet induces insulin resistance by disrupting mTORC2 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex ). Here, we induce insulin resistance by genetically disrupting adipose mTORC2 via tissue-specific deletion of the mTORC2 component Rictor (AQ-RKO). Loss of adipose mTORC2 blunts the metabolic adaptation to CR and prevents whole-body sensitization to insulin. Despite this, AQ-RKO mice subject to CR experience the same increase in fitness and lifespan on a CR diet as wild-type mice. We conclude that the CR-induced improvement in insulin sensitivity is dispensable for the effects of CR on fitness and longevity.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31317231>Synergistic activation of thermogenic adipocytes by a combination of PPARγ activation, SMAD3 inhibition and adrenergic receptor activation ameliorates metabolic abnormalities in rodents.</a></h2><p>To treat obesity and related diseases, considerable effort has gone into developing strategies to convert white adipocytes into thermogenic brown-like adipocytes ('browning').

In addition, physiological changes consequent to signal control were examined in vivo using lean and diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6J mice.Combined treatment with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonist rosiglitazone, the SMAD3 inhibitor SIS3 and the adrenergic receptor agonist noradrenaline (norepinephrine) synergistically induced Ucp1, Fgf21 and Cited1 expression, triggering brown . Synergistic induction of Ucp1 by the three agents was negatively regulated by forkhead box O (FOXO)3 via the inhibition of PPARγ-dependent gene transcription. Moreover, the administration of rosiglitazone, SIS3 and the selective β3 adrenergic receptor agonist CL316,243 to DIO mice reduced the amount of body-fat deposits (body weight from day 0 to 14, 12.3% reduction), concomitant with morphological changes in white adipose tissue, an increase in mitochondrial biosynthesis and a marked induction of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Furthermore, administration of the three agents significantly increased serum adiponectin levels (mean 65.56 μg/ml with the three agents vs 20.79 μg/ml in control mice, p < 0.05) and improved glucose and lipid tolerance.These results suggest that the combined regulation of PPARγ, SMAD and the adrenergic receptor signalling pathway synergistically induces brown  and may serve as an effective strategy to treat obesity and related diseases, including type  diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659183>S-nitrosoglutathione inhibits  in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by S-nitrosation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β.</a></h2><p>Murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes share many similarities with primary fat cells and represent a reliable in vitro model of .

Biochemical analysis after 7 days of differentiation showed a prominent anti-adipogenic effect of GSNO which was evident as reduced cellular triglycerides and total protein content as well as decreased mRNA and protein expression of late transcription factors (e.g. peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ) and markers of terminal differentiation (e.g. leptin). By contrast, the nitrosothiol did not affect mRNA and protein expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), which represents a pivotal early transcription factor of the adipogenic cascade. Differentiation was also inhibited by the NO donor (Z)-1-[-(-aminoethyl)-N-(-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,-diolate. Biotin switch experiments showed significantly increased S-nitrosation of C/EBPβ variants indicating that posttranslational S-nitrosative modification of this transcription factor accounts for the observed anti-adipogenic effect of NO.

Obesity and impaired glucose homeostasis are closely related, and during the last decades of investigation about vitamin D, several clinical and epidemiological studies documented an inverse correlation between circulating vitamin D levels, central adiposity and the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. The insufficient sun exposure and outdoor activities of obese individuals, the storage of vitamin D in adipose tissue, because of its lipophilic properties, and the vitamin D-mediated modulation of , insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity and the immune system, are the main reasons for the close relationship between obesity, glucose homeostasis and hypovitaminosis D.

However, the genetic factors underlying myofiber-type specification and intramuscular fat (IMF) accumulation remain to be elucidated. Using two independent intercrosses between Western commercial breeds and Korean native pigs (KNPs) and a joint linkage-linkage disequilibrium analysis, we identified a 488.1-kb region on porcine chromosome 12 that affects both reddish meat color (a*) and IMF. In this critical region, only the MYH3 gene, encoding myosin heavy chain 3, was found to be preferentially overexpressed in the skeletal muscle of KNPs. Subsequently, MYH3-transgenic mice demonstrated that this gene controls both myofiber-type specification and  in skeletal muscle. We discovered a structural variant in the promotor/regulatory region of MYH3 for which Q allele carriers exhibited significantly higher values of a* and IMF than q allele carriers. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation and cotransfection assays showed that the structural variant in the 5'-flanking region of MYH3 abrogated the binding of the myogenic regulatory factors (MYF5, MYOD, MYOG, and MRF4). The allele distribution of MYH3 among pig populations worldwide indicated that the MYH3 Q allele is of Asian origin and likely predates domestication. In conclusion, we identified a functional regulatory sequence variant in porcine MYH3 that provides novel insights into the genetic basis of the regulation of myofiber type ratios and associated changes in IMF in pigs. The MYH3 variant can play an important role in improving pork quality in current breeding programs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443567>Dietary Fructose and the Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h2><p>: Consumption of fructose, the sweetest of all naturally occurring carbohydrates, has increased dramatically in the last 40 years and is today commonly used commercially in soft drinks, juice, and baked goods. These products comprise a large proportion of the modern diet, in particular in children, adolescents, and young adults. A large body of evidence associate consumption of fructose and other sugar-sweetened beverages with insulin resistance, intrahepatic lipid accumulation, and hypertriglyceridemia. In the long term, these risk factors may contribute to the development of type  diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Fructose is absorbed in the small intestine and metabolized in the liver where it stimulates fructolysis, glycolysis, , and glucose production.

Moreover, a diet high in iTFAs could increase the risk of obesity, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and type  diabetes mellitus. Glucose and lipid metabolism are closely linked in white adipose tissue (WAT), yet the underlying mechanisms of the effect of iTFAs in WAT are poorly understood.Parameters of glucose homeostasis, lipid profiles and markers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress of WAT were measured in rats maintained on a high-fat diet containing margarine (HFD-M) (n=10) compared to controls maintained on standard chow (n=10) over 16 weeks.Fat mass and body weight was significantly increased in rats maintained on the HFD-M compared to controls (<0.01). HFD-M rats had increased levels of insulin (INS), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and serum lipid profile was significantly altered. The expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and the phosphorylation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1-alpha and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were significantly increased in subcutaneous and retroperitoneal adipose depots of HFD-M-fed rats. In vitro, wider ER lumens were observed in 100μmol/L elaidic acid (EA)-treated human mature adipocytes. We observed activation of ER stress markers, impaired INS receptor signaling and increased  in adipocytes after EA exposure. These effects could be alleviated by inhibiting ER stress in adipocytes in vitro.Collectively these data suggest that ER stress may be involved in INS resistance and lipid metabolism disorders induced by high-fat diet containing iTFAs. These findings suggest that WAT could be regarded as a key target organ for inhibiting ER stress to reverse the impaired INS receptor signaling, alleviate lipid metabolism disorders, and provide a novel approach to prevent and treat INS resistance and dyslipidemia-related chronic diseases such as T2MD and CVDs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511221>[Risedronate inhibits rat bone marrow  and reduces RANKL expression in adipocytes].</a></h2><p>To investigate the effects of risedronate on bone marrow  and the expression of the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) in adipocytes in the bone marrow micro-environment.Primary cultured rat mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) with or without adipogenic induction for 14 days were treated with 1, 5, 10, and 25 μmol/L risedronate.

A previous long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) profiling analysis revealed a potential role for fatty liver-related lncRNA  (FLRL2) in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. To further understand the role of FLRL2 in NAFLD and explore its therapeutic value, both  and  NAFLD models were constructed. Small interfering RNA and small hairpin RNA interference and adenovirus transfection were adopted to manipulate the expressions of FLRL2, aryl-hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (Arntl), and sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) expression. Steatosis was evaluated through histologic staining with hematoxylin and eosin and oil red O and also by quantitative triglyceride measurements. FLRL2 is a widely distributed nuclear lncRNA that is down-regulated in NAFLD. Overexpression of FLRL2 resolved steatosis, , inflammation, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in NAFLD, and down-regulation of FLRL2 resulted in the opposite effects. Sequence analysis demonstrated that FLRL2 was located in the intronic region of the Arntl gene, and a luciferase assay showed transcriptional activation of the Arntl gene upon FLRL2 overexpression. A similar expression pattern and synergistic effect of Arntl manipulation was observed in NAFLD . Inhibition of Arntl partially reversed the steatosis amelioration induced by FLRL2 overexpression. Downstream Sirt1 was also inhibited in NAFLD and influenced by both FLRL2 and Arntl. In NAFLD mice, FLRL2 enhancement alleviated steatosis, activated the Arntl-Sirt1 axis, and inhibited , ER stress, and inflammation, providing preliminary evidence of the benefits of FLRL2-mediated gene therapy in NAFLD.-Chen, Y., Chen, X., Gao, J., Xu, C., Xu, P., Li, Y., Zhu, Y., Yu, C.

MSCs are affected by several intrinsic and extrinsic signaling modulators, including growth factors, cytokines, extracellular matrix and hormones. Melatonin, produced by the pineal gland, is a hormone that regulates sleep cycles. Recent studies have shown that melatonin improves the therapeutic effects of stem cells. The present study aimed to investigate whether melatonin enhances the biological activities of human adipose‑derived MSCs. The results demonstrated that treatment with melatonin promoted cell proliferation by inducing SRY‑box transcription factor  gene expression and preventing replicative senescence. In addition, melatonin exerted anti‑adipogenic effects on MSCs. PCR analysis revealed that the expression of the CCAAT enhancer binding protein a gene, a key transcription factor in , was decreased following melatonin treatment, resulting in reduced adipogenic differentiation in an in vitro assay. The present study also examined the effect of melatonin on the immunomodulatory response using a co‑culture system of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and MSCs. Activated T cells were strongly inhibited following melatonin exposure compared with those in the control group. Finally, the favorable effects of melatonin on MSCs were confirmed using luzindole, a selective melatonin receptor antagonist. The proliferation‑promoting, anti‑inflammatory effects of melatonin suggested that melatonin‑treated MSCs may be used for effective cell therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31369090>Overeating Saturated Fat Promotes Fatty Liver and Ceramides Compared With Polyunsaturated Fat: A Randomized Trial.</a></h2><p>Saturated fatty acid (SFA) vs polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) may promote nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by yet unclear mechanisms.To investigate if overeating SFA- and PUFA-enriched diets lead to differential liver fat accumulation in overweight and obese humans.Double-blind randomized trial (LIPOGAIN-).

Hepatic glucose production plays a crucial role in the maintenance of normal glucose levels in the organism i.e. between 0.7 to 1.1 g/l. The loss of this function leads to a rare genetic metabolic disease named glycogen storage disease type I (GSDI), characterized by severe hypoglycemia during short fasts. On the contrary, type  diabetes is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, partly due to an overproduction of glucose by the liver. Indeed, diabetes is characterized by increased uptake/production of glucose by hepatocytes, leading to the activation of   and the development of a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In GSDI, the accumulation of glucose-6 phosphate, which cannot be hydrolyzed into glucose, leads to an increase of glycogen stores and the development of hepatic steatosis. Thus, in these pathologies, hepatocytes are subjected to cellular stress mainly induced by glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity. In this review, we have compared hepatic cellular stress induced in type  diabetes and GSDI, especially oxidative stress, autophagy deregulation, and ER-stress. In addition, both GSDI and diabetic patients are prone to the development of hepatocellular adenomas (HCA) that occur on a fatty liver in the absence of cirrhosis. These HCA can further acquire malignant traits and transform into hepatocellular carcinoma. This process of tumorigenesis highlights the importance of an optimal metabolic control in both GSDI and diabetic patients in order to prevent, or at least to restrain, tumorigenic activity during disturbed glucose metabolism pathologies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569751>High Energy Intake Induced Overexpression of Transcription Factors and Its Regulatory Genes Involved in Acceleration of Hepatic : A Rat Model for Type  Diabetes.</a></h2><p>Type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by impaired insulin action and its secretion. The objectives of the present study were to establish an economical and efficient animal model, mimicking pathophysiology of human T2DM to understand probable molecular mechanisms in context with lipid metabolism. In the present study, male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups. Animals were fed with high fat diet (HFD) except healthy control (HC) for 12 weeks. After eight weeks, intra peritoneal glucose tolerance test was performed. After confirmation of glucose intolerance, diabetic control (DC) group was injected with streptozotocin (STZ) (35 mg/kg b.w., i.p.). HFD fed rats showed increase ( ≤ 0.001) in glucose tolerance and HOMA-IR as compared to HC. Diabetes rats showed abnormal ( ≤ 0.001) lipid profile as compared to HC. The hepatocyte expression of transcription factors  and  and their target genes were found to be upregulated, while  and  expressions were downregulated as compared to the HC. A number of animal models have been raised for studying T2DM, but the study has been restricted to only the biochemical level.

Reactive oxygen species play a key role in the regulation of  and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by adipocytes. Quercetin (QCT) regulates  by affecting the redox state of preadipocytes. Ochratoxin A (OTA) is one of the most prevalent mycotoxins contaminating food. It has cytotoxic, genotoxic, pro-inflammatory, and anti-adipogenic effects. Antioxidants are believed to protect cells from the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity induced by OTA. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of QCT and OTA application on preadipocyte differentiation, oxidative status, and adipocyte metabolism. () Methods: Primary rat preadipocytes were isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissue of Wistar rats. Gene expressions were determined by qPCR. Cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, glucose uptake, and lipid accumulation were determined using commercially available kits. (3) Results: A dose-dependent inhibitory effect of QCT on adipogenic differentiation was observed, which was accompanied by a decrease in ROS production. Reduced ROS formation is closely related to impaired glucose uptake by adipocytes.

Here we report a role for the broadly conserved miR-26 family of microRNAs (miR-26a-1, miR-26a-, and miR-26b) as major regulators of APC differentiation and adipose tissue mass. Deletion of all miR-26-encoding loci in mice resulted in a dramatic expansion of adipose tissue in adult animals fed normal chow. Conversely, transgenic overexpression of miR-26a protected mice from high-fat diet-induced obesity. These effects were attributable to a cell-autonomous function of miR-26 as a potent inhibitor of APC differentiation. miR-26 blocks , at least in part, by repressing expression of , a conserved miR-26 target without a previously known role in adipocyte biology that encodes a component of SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes.

Here, we investigated the metabolic impact of this intervention in -mo-old prediabetic University of California, Davis type  diabetes mellitus rats by assessing liver gene expression at 1.5 mo post-IT surgery. Pathway analysis indicated decreased signaling  TGF-β/Smad (a family of proteins named mothers against decapentaplegic homologs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), and PI3K-Akt-AMPK-mechanistic target of rapamycin, likely targeting hepatic stellate cells because differentiation and activation of these cells is associated with decreased signaling  PPAR and TGF-β/Smad. IT surgery up-regulated the expression of genes involved in regulation of cholesterol and terpenoid syntheses and down-regulated those involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism [including cardiolipin (CL)], , and gluconeogenesis. Consistent with the down-regulation of the hepatic CL pathway, IT surgery produced a metabolic switch in liver, kidney cortex, and fat depots toward decreased mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, the process required to fuel high energy-demanding pathways (, gluconeogenesis and glyceroneogenesis), whereas opposite effects were observed in skeletal and cardiac muscles.

Increasing interest has been given to the associations among diet, oxidative stress, gut-liver axis, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Here, we investigated the effects of processed meat proteins on biomarkers of lipid homeostasis, hepatic metabolism, antioxidant functions, and gut microbiota composition in glutaredoxin1 deficient (Glrx1) mice. The wild-type (WT) and Glrx1 mice were fed a soy protein diet (SPD), a dry-cured pork protein diet (DPD), a braised pork protein diet (BPD), and a cooked pork protein diet (CPD) at a dose of 20% of protein for 3 months. Serum and hepatic total cholesterol, serum endotoxin, hepatic liver droplet %, and antioxidant capacity were significantly increased in the CPD fed WT mice. In addition, CPD fed Glrx1 mice significantly increased total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and pro-inflammatory cytokines which are accompanied by higher steatosis scores, intrahepatic lipid accumulation, and altered gene expression associated with lipid metabolism. Furthermore, hepatic gene expression of Nrf2/keap1 signaling pathway and its downstream signaling targets were determined using RT-qPCR. Glrx1 deficiency increased Nrf2 activity and expression of its target genes (GPx, catalase, SOD1, G6pd, and Bbc3), which was exacerbated by intake of CPD. Metagenomic analyses revealed that Glrx1 mice fed meat protein diets had higher abundances of , , and  but lower abundances of , , and  than their wild-type counterparts. In summary, Glrx1 deficiency induced an increase in serum biomarkers for lipid homeostasis, gut microbiota imbalance, and upregulation of Nrf2/Keap1 and antioxidant defense genes, which was aggravated by cooked meat protein diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31270932>PACAP ameliorates hepatic metabolism and inflammation through up-regulating FAIM in obesity.</a></h2><p>Obesity is considered a chronic inflammatory disease, the inflammatory factors, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and small inducible cytokine A5 (RANTES), are elevated in obese individuals. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) suppresses anti-inflammatory cytokines and ameliorates glucose and lipid metabolism. Our previous study showed that Fas apoptosis inhibitory molecule (FAIM) is a new mediator of Akt2 signalling, increases the insulin signalling pathway and lipid metabolism. In this study, we found that PACAP promoted the expression of FAIM protein in a human hepatocyte cell line (L02). Overexpression of FAIM with lentivirus suppressed the expression of the inflammatory factor interleukin 6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Following treatment of obese mice with FAIM or PACAP for  weeks, inflammation was alleviated and the bodyweight and blood glucose levels were decreased. Overexpression of FAIM down-regulated the expression of  proteins, including SREBP1, SCD1, FAS, SREBP2 and HMGCR, and up-regulated glycogen synthesis proteins, including Akt2 (Ser474) phosphorylation, GLUT2 and GSK-3β, in the liver of obese mice. However, down-regulation of FAIM with shRNA promotes obesity. Altogether, our data identified that FAIM mediates the function of PACAP in anti-inflammation, glucose regulation and lipid metabolism in obese liver.© 2019 The Authors.

The role and underlying mechanism of chemerin in developing IR of the granulosa cells from PCOS remain unclear. Plasma, follicular fluid, and human granulosa-lutein cells (hGLs) were collected from non-PCOS and patients with PCOS with or without IR. The chemerin levels were elevated in both follicular fluid and hGL samples from patients with PCOS with IR, and the hGLs from patients with PCOS with IR showed decreased insulin sensitivity and impaired glucose uptake capacity. Moreover, treatment of chemerin attenuated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by decreasing phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)1/ Tyr612, phosphorylation of protein kinase B Ser473, and membrane translocation of glucose transporter type 4 through increasing Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS1 in cultured hGLs. These effects could be abolished by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of chemokine-like receptor 1. Furthermore, insulin induced the expression of chemerin in hGLs.

However, its antidiabetic effect and molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Therefore, we investigated the hypolipidemic effect of  larva extract (ADLE) in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced C57BL/6J mice model. Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in HFD-induced diabetic mice significantly improved after ADLE administration for six weeks. The levels of serum triglyceride (TG), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transferase (ALT) activity, and lipid accumulation were increased in the liver of HFD-fed mice, but the levels were significantly reduced by the ADLE treatment. Moreover, hepatic fibrosis and inflammatory gene expression in the liver from HFD-treated mice were ameliorated by the ADLE treatment. Dephosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by palmitate was inhibited in the ADLE treated HepG2 cells, and subsequently reduced expression of lipogenic genes, such as -, , and  were observed. The reduced expression of lipogenic genes and an increased phosphorylation of AMPK was also observed in the liver from diabetic mice treated with ADLE. In conclusion, ADLE ameliorates hyperlipidemia through inhibition of hepatic  via activating the AMPK signaling pathway. These findings suggest that ADLE and its constituent bioactive compounds are valuable to prevent or treat hepatic insulin resistance in type  diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569380>Curcumin Attenuates  by Inducing Preadipocyte Apoptosis and Inhibiting Adipocyte Differentiation.</a></h2><p>Patients with metabolic syndrome are at an increased risk of developing type  diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The principal risk factor for development of metabolic syndrome is obesity, defined as a state of pathological hyperplasia or/and hypertrophy of adipose tissue. The number of mature adipocytes is determined by adipocyte differentiation from preadipocytes. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effects of curcumin on  and the underlying mechanism. To examine cell toxicity of curcumin, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with 0-50 µM curcumin for 24, 48, or 72 h, then cell viability was measured using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol--yl)-,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The effect of curcumin on the cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry. Curcumin-induced cell apoptosis was determined by the TUNEL assay and curcumin-induced caspase activation was measured by immunoblotting. The effect of curcumin on adipocyte differentiation was determined by measuring mitotic clonal expansion (MCE), expression of adipogenic transcription factors, and lipid accumulation. Results showed the viability of preadipocytes was significantly decreased by treatment with 30 µM curcumin, a concentration that caused apoptosis in preadipocytes, as assessed by the TUNEL assay, and caused activation of caspases 8, 9, and 3. A non-cytotoxic dose of curcumin (15 µM) inhibited MCE, downregulated the expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, prevented differentiation medium-induced β-catenin downregulation, and decreased the lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

Generally, a higher elasticity of culture substrates can drive cells into the osteogenic lineage, whereas low substrate elasticity results in . Applied mechanical loading by cyclic strain is another major variable influencing cell fate. Yet, little is known about the simultaneous effect of both cues. Therefore, the present study investigated the relative importance of both cues on differentiation. MSCs were cultured in an osteogenic and also an adipogenic environment on soft PAAm (E= 23±0.3 kPa), stiff PAAm (111± kPa), and PDMS (E= 1,5±0.07 MPa); either unstrained or with 8% cyclic strain at 1 Hz. Without strain, the relative expression of the early osteogenic marker alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was significantly higher (78%) on PDMS than both PAAm. With 8% cyclic strain ALP expression increased for all groups in comparison to unstrained controls. The highest increase was observed for the soft PAAm by 36%. Moreover, relative Oil red O (ORO) expression -indicating - was the highest for unstrained soft PAAm. On the other hand, the percentage ORO positive cells significantly decreased by 57% and 69% for PAAm soft and stiff when strained. In conclusion, biomaterial elasticity and mechanical loading can act simultaneously on cell differentiation. Substrate elasticity is an important factor regulating the differentiation, but cyclic strain can drive MSCs towards the osteogenesis even on the softest substrate. As such, the osteogenic effect of mechanical loading can overrule the adipogenic effect of soft substrates, thereby acting as an inhibitor.This article is protected by copyright.

However, the epigenetic mechanisms underlying this activity remain unexplored. Here, gene set enrichment analysis using microarray data indicated that there was significant downregulation of -associated and PPARγ target genes and upregulation of genes bound with H3K27me3 in response to piperine. As shown by Gene Ontology analysis, the upregulated genes are related to lipid oxidation and polycomb repressive complex  (PRC2). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that PPARγ (and its coactivators), H3K4me3, and H3K9ac were less enriched at the PPAR response element of three adipogenic genes, whereas increased accumulation of H3K9me2, H3K27me3, and Ezh2 was found, which likely led to the reduced gene expression. Further analysis using three lipolytic genes revealed the opposite enrichment pattern of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 at the Ezh2 binding site. Treatment with GSK343, an Ezh2 inhibitor, elevated lipolytic gene expression by decreasing the enrichment of H3K27me3 during , which confirms that Ezh2 plays a repressive role in lipolysis. Overall, these results suggest that piperine regulates the expression of adipogenic and lipolytic genes by dynamic regulation of histone modifications, leading to the repression of adipocyte differentiation.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315616>NR6A1 regulates lipid metabolism through mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p> is required for the optimal growth of many types of cancer cells, it is shown to control the biosynthesis of the lipid bilayer membrane during rapid proliferation and metastasis, provides cancer cells with signaling lipid molecules to support cancer development and make cancer cells more resistant to oxidative stress-induced cell death.

RT-qPCR method was performed to investigate target gene of NR6A1. Western blot was employed to determine the mechanisms by which NR6A1 regulates lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells.We provide evidence that NR6A1 is a novel regulator of lipid metabolism in HepG2 cells. NR6A1 knockdown can increase lipid accumulation as well as insulin-induced proliferation and migration of HepG2 cells. The lipogenic effect correlated well with the expression of lipogenic genes, including fatty acid synthase (FAS), diglyceride acyltransferase- (DGAT2), malic enzyme 1 (ME1), microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK).

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now one of the major risk factors for HCC. NAFLD, which involves the accumulation of excess lipid in cytoplasmic lipid droplets in hepatocytes, can progress to non-alcoholic steatosis, fibrosis, and HCC. Changes in intracellular Ca constitute important signaling pathways for the regulation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in normal hepatocytes. Recent studies of steatotic hepatocytes have identified lipid-induced changes in intracellular Ca, and have provided evidence that altered Ca signaling exacerbates lipid accumulation and may promote HCC. The aims of this review are to summarise current knowledge of the lipid-induced changes in hepatocyte Ca homeostasis, to comment on the mechanisms involved, and discuss the pathways leading from altered Ca homeostasis to enhanced lipid accumulation and the potential promotion of HCC. In steatotic hepatocytes, lipid inhibits store-operated Ca entry and SERCA2b, and activates Ca efflux from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and its transfer to mitochondria. These changes are associated with changes in Ca concentrations in the ER (decreased), cytoplasmic space (increased) and mitochondria (likely increased). They lead to: inhibition of lipolysis, lipid autophagy, lipid oxidation, and lipid secretion; activation of ; increased lipid; ER stress, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), activation of Ca/calmodulin-dependent kinases and activation of transcription factor Nrf2. These all can potentially mediate the transition of NAFLD to HCC. It is concluded that lipid-induced changes in hepatocyte Ca homeostasis are important in the initiation and progression of HCC. Further research is desirable to better understand the cause and effect relationships, the time courses and mechanisms involved, and the potential of Ca transporters, channels, and binding proteins as targets for pharmacological intervention.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

With the current study we aimed to verify the modulatory effect of endocannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1)-signaling on perilipin  (PLIN2)-mediated lipophagy. Here, we demonstrate that a global knockout of the cannabinoid receptor 1 gene (CB1) reduced the expression of the lipid droplet binding protein PLIN2 in the livers of CB1 and hepatitis B surface protein (HBs)-transgenic mice, which spontaneously develop hepatic steatosis. In addition, the pharmacologic activation and antagonization of CB1 in cell culture also caused an induction or reduction of PLIN2, respectively. The decreased PLIN2 expression was associated with suppressed  and triglyceride (TG) synthesis and enhanced autophagy as shown by increased colocalization of LC3B with lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) in HBs/CB1 mice. The induction of autophagy was further supported by the increased expression of LAMP1 in CB1 and HBs/CB1 mice. LAMP1 and PLIN2 were co-localized in HBs/CB1 indicating autophagy of cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs) i.e., lipophagy. Lipolysis of lipid droplets was additionally indicated by elevated expression of lysosomal acid lipase. In conclusion, these results suggest that loss of CB1 signaling leads to reduced PLIN2 abundance, which triggers lipophagy. Our new findings about the association between CB1 signaling and PLIN2 may stimulate translational studies analyzing new diagnostic and therapeutic options for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563732>Effects of second-generation antipsychotics on human subcutaneous adipose tissue metabolism.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome is prevalent in up to 50% of schizophrenia patients, which reduces their quality of life and their compliance with the treatment. It is unclear whether metabolic adverse effects of these agents are due to their direct effect on insulin-sensitive tissues or are secondary to increased adiposity. The study aimed to investigate the direct effects of the second-generation antipsychotics olanzapine and aripiprazole on human subcutaneous adipose tissue and isolated adipocyte metabolism.Abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue needle biopsies were taken from 72 healthy subjects (49 F/23 M; age: 19-78 yr; BMI: 20.0-35.6 kg/m). Isolated adipocytes or adipose tissue were respectively pre-incubated short- (30 min) and long-term (24 h, 72 h) with or without olanzapine (0.004 μM - 20 μM) and aripiprazole (0.002 μM - 100 μM). Pre-incubated adipose tissue was then snap-frozen for mRNA expression analysis of adipokines genes and genes involved in inflammation, , and mitochondrial function. Isolated adipocytes were used to measure basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and lipolysis.Acute treatment with a therapeutic concentration of olanzapine decreases basal lipolysis in isolated adipocytes; this effect was not observed after long-term incubation with the drug. Supra-therapeutic concentration of aripiprazole reduced basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake after short- and long-term pre-incubation. Both drugs at supra-therapeutic concentrations downregulated the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6 and IL1B genes after 72 h incubation. Similarly, supra-therapeutic concentrations of both drugs and therapeutic concentration of olanzapine, reduced the expression of PPARGC1A, PDK4, and CPT1B genes involved in the regulation of mitochondrial functions. Neither of the antipsychotics affected the expression of the main adipokines LEP and ADIPOQ, genes involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism, LPL and FASN, nor the master  regulator, PPARG.Therapheutic concentrations of olanzapine and aripiprazole have a moderate direct effect on adipocyte lipid and glucose metabolism, respectively. At supra-therapeutic concentrations, both of the antipsychotics seem to act as anti-inflammatory agents and mildly suppressed genes involved in the regulation of mitochondrial functions, which could potentially contribute to metabolic adverse effects. Alternatively, second-generation antipsychotics could induce metabolic side effects via acting on other insulin-sensitive tissues and central nervous system.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The present study investigated the potential role of isoimperatorin on 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. mRNA and protein levels of differentiation- and lipid accumulation-associated genes, as well as the -related signaling pathway were analyzed in control and isoimperatorin-treated differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. Results determined that isoimperatorin promoted 3T3-L1 fibroblast  in a dose-dependent manner compared with standard differentiation inducers. Isoimperatorin significantly increased mRNA and protein expression of the crucial adipogenic transcription factors peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα). mRNA expression of the downstream -related genes sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1c, adipocyte protein , fatty acid synthase, adiponectin and diacylglycerol -acyltransferase  were also significantly increased following isoimperatorin treatment. The underlying mechanism likely involved activation of the Akt signaling pathway.

Adipocytes are one source of estradiol in patients with breast cancer. Recent studies have shown that phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 plays a critical role in . Therefore, estrogen depletion therapy might have beneficial effects in phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1-positive breast cancer. This study was conducted to evaluate the value of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 as a marker for gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment, a form of estrogen depletion therapy, for premenopausal patients with HR-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor -negative breast cancer. We reviewed the medical records of 296 premenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor -negative primary invasive breast cancer treated between 2008 and 2015. Phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 positivity was defined by immunohistochemical staining scores of 1+, + and 3+, whereas a score of 0 was considered negative. Phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1-positive tumors were found in 74.0% of the patients. In the phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1-positive group, disease-free survival of patients treated with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist was significantly longer than that of patients treated without a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (mean 106.7 months vs mean 91.1 months, P = 0.018). Phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 is a potential biomarker for predicting the efficacy of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy in premenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor -negative breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31245168>Hepatic lipid homeostasis by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma .</a></h2><p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ or PPARG) is a ligand-activated transcription factor belonging to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. It plays a master role in the differentiation and proliferation of adipose tissues. It has two major isoforms, PPARγ1 and PPARγ, encoded from a single gene using two separate promoters and alternative splicing. Among them, PPARγ is most abundantly expressed in adipocytes and plays major adipogenic and lipogenic roles in the tissue. Furthermore, it has been shown that PPARγ is also expressed in the liver, specifically in hepatocytes, and its expression level positively correlates with fat accumulation induced by pathological conditions such as obesity and diabetes. Knockout of the hepatic  gene ameliorates hepatic steatosis induced by diet or genetic manipulations. Transcriptional activation of  in the liver induces the adipogenic program to store fatty acids in lipid droplets as observed in adipocytes. Understanding how the hepatic  gene expression is regulated will help develop preventative and therapeutic treatments for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Due to the potential adverse effect of hepatic  gene deletion on peripheral tissue functions, therapeutic interventions that target PPARγ for fatty liver diseases require fine-tuning of this gene's expression and transcriptional activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31477154>4-cholesten-3-one decreases breast cancer cell viability and alters membrane raft-localized EGFR expression by reducing  and enhancing LXR-dependent cholesterol transporters.</a></h2><p>The alteration of lipid metabolism in cancer cells is recognized as one of the most important metabolic hallmarks of cancer. Membrane rafts defined as plasma membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids serve as platforms for signaling regulation in cancer. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the cholesterol metabolite, 4-cholesten-3-one, on lipid metabolism and membrane raft integrity in two breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. Its ability to reduce cell viability and migration has also been investigated.RT-qPCR was performed to evaluate the expression of enzymes involved in  and cholesterol synthesis, and ABCG1 and ABCA1 transporters involved in cholesterol efflux. Its effect on cell viability and migration was studied using the MTT assay, the wound healing assay and the Transwell migration assay, respectively. The effect of 4-cholesten-3-one on membrane rafts integrity was investigated by studying the protein expression of flotillin-, a membrane raft marker, and raft-enriched EGFR by western blot.Interestingly, we found that 4-cholesten-3-one treatment decreased mRNA expression of different enzymes including ACC1, FASN, SCD1 and HMGCR. We further demonstrated that 4-cholesten-3-one increased the expression of ABCG1 and ABCA1. We also found that 4-cholesten-3-one decreased the viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. This effect was neutralized after treatment with LXR inverse agonist or after LXRβ knockdown by siRNA. As a result, we also demonstrated that 4-cholesten-3-one disrupts membrane rafts and cell migration capacity.Our results show that 4-cholesten-3-one exerts promising antitumor activity by altering LXR-dependent lipid metabolism in breast cancer cells without increasing .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519114>GS-0976 (Firsocostat): an investigational liver-directed acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitor for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).</a></h2><p>:   (DNL) plays a major role in fatty acid metabolism and contributes significantly to triglyceride accumulation within the hepatocytes in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

However, the precise underlying mechanisms and signaling by which the immune system regulates energy homeostasis in metabolic tissues remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the AT-rich interactive domain 5A (Arid5a), a cytokine-induced nucleic acid binding protein, is important for the maintenance of adipose tissue homeostasis. Long-term deficiency of Arid5a in mice results in adult-onset severe obesity. In contrast, transgenic mice overexpressing Arid5a are highly resistant to high-fat diet-induced obesity. Inhibition of Arid5a facilitates the in vitro differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells and fibroblasts to adipocytes, whereas its induction substantially inhibits their differentiation. Molecular studies reveal that Arid5a represses the transcription of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma  (Ppar-γ) due to which, in the absence of Arid5a, Ppar-γ is persistently expressed in fibroblasts. This phenomenon is accompanied by enhanced fatty acid uptake in Arid5a-deficient cells, which shifts metabolic homeostasis toward prolipid metabolism. Furthermore, we show that Arid5a and Ppar-γ are dynamically counterregulated by each other, hence maintaining adipogenic homeostasis. Thus, we show that Arid5a is an important negative regulator of energy metabolism and can be a potential target for metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

OPN exists in  forms, secreted-OPN (sOPN) and intracellular-OPN (iOPN). While they might have different biological activities, it remains largely unknown whether sOPN and iOPN induce the differentiation of brown adipocytes. To test this possibility, 3T3-L1 cells were induced by DMI induction with or without recombinant human OPN (rhOPN, 10, 50, 100, 200 μM), respectively. Meanwhile, another batch of 3T3-L1 cells were infected with Ad-GFP-ap2-OPN and followed by DMI differentiation. Subsequently, the infected cells were treated with either anti-CD44 antibody or immunoglobulin G (Ig G). Accumulation of lipid droplets was visualized by Oil red O staining and protein levels were assayed by western blotting analysis. The results showed that sOPN and not rhOPN, notably increased the accumulation of lipid droplets and the expression of brown adipocyte-related genes. Moreover, neutralization of CD44 partially abrogated the effects induced by sOPN. These data demonstrate that sOPN and not rhOPN has the capacity to induce the differentiation of white preadipocytes into brown adipocytes through a CD44-dependent mechanism.

However, FAPs isolated from young dystrophin-deficient  mice are insensitive to this control mechanism. An unbiased mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of FAPs from muscles of wild-type and  mice suggested that the synergistic cooperation between NOTCH and inflammatory signals controls FAP differentiation. Remarkably, we demonstrated that factors released by hematopoietic cells restore the sensitivity to NOTCH adipogenic inhibition in  FAPs.

The hairless phenotype in Rac1-KO mice was markedly exacerbated in Rac1/Rac3-DKO mice. Strikingly, Rac1-KO mice exhibited thinner dermal white adipose tissue, which was considerably further reduced in Rac1/Rac3-DKO mice. DNA microarray using primary keratinocytes from Rac1/Rac3-DKO mice exhibited decreased mRNA levels of Bmp2, Bmp5, Fgf20, Fgf21, Fgfbp1, and Pdgfα. Combinational treatment with bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)  and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21 in culture medium, but not individual purified recombinant proteins, could differentiate 3T3-L1 fibroblasts into adipocytes, as could culture media from primary keratinocytes. Conversely, addition of anti-BMP2 or anti-FGF21 antibodies into the culture medium inhibited fibroblast differentiation.

Pharmacological or bioactive food ingredients that suppress hepatic lipid accumulation through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, which plays a critical role in the regulation of lipid metabolism, are searched.It is found that tomatidine, the aglycone of α-tomatine abundant in green tomatoes, significantly inhibits palmitate-provoked lipid accumulation and stimulates phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) in human HepG2 hepatocytes. The results also indicate that tomatidine can enhance triglyceride turnover and decline in  by upregulating adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and downregulating fatty acid synthase (FAS) via the AMPK signaling-dependent regulation of transcription factors, element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1). Furthermore, mechanistic studies demonstrate that tomatidine-stimulated AMPK phosphorylation is due to CaMKKβ activation in response to an increase in intracellular Ca concentration. Finally, it is discovered that tomatidine functions as an agonist for vitamin D receptor to elicit AMPK-dependent suppression of lipid accumulation.The in vitro study suggests the potential efficacy of tomatidine as a preventive and therapeutic treatment in obesity-related fatty liver diseases.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Steroid hormones and bile acids are potent regulators of hepatic carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Steroid 5β-reductase (AKR1D1) is highly expressed in human liver where it inactivates steroid hormones and catalyzes a fundamental step in bile acid synthesis.Human liver biopsies were obtained from 34 obese patients and AKR1D1 mRNA expression levels were measured using qPCR. Genetic manipulation of AKR1D1 was performed in human HepG2 and Huh7 liver cell lines. Metabolic assessments were made using transcriptome analysis, western blotting, mass spectrometry, clinical biochemistry, and enzyme immunoassays.In human liver biopsies, AKR1D1 expression decreased with advancing steatosis, fibrosis and inflammation. Expression was decreased in patients with type  diabetes. In human liver cell lines, AKR1D1 knockdown decreased primary bile acid biosynthesis and steroid hormone clearance. RNA-sequencing identified disruption of key metabolic pathways, including insulin action and fatty acid metabolism. AKR1D1 knockdown increased hepatocyte triglyceride accumulation, insulin sensitivity, and glycogen synthesis, through increased de novo  and decreased β-oxidation, fueling hepatocyte inflammation. Pharmacological manipulation of bile acid receptor activation prevented the induction of lipogenic and carbohydrate genes, suggesting that the observed metabolic phenotype is driven through bile acid rather than steroid hormone availability.Genetic manipulation of AKR1D1 regulates the metabolic phenotype of human hepatoma cell lines, driving steatosis and inflammation.

However, lipid productivity of microalgae is still far below commercial viability. Here, a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from the oleaginous microalga Nannochloropsis oceanica is identified and heterologously expressed in the green microalga Chlorella pyrenoidosa to characterize its function in the pentose phosphate pathway. It is found that the G6PD enzyme activity toward NADPH production is increased by .19-fold in engineered microalgal strains. Lipidomic analysis reveals up to 3.09-fold increase of neutral lipid content in the engineered strains, and lipid yield is gradually increased throughout the cultivation phase and saturated at the stationary phase.

Our previous study reveals that interleukin-4 (IL-4) inhibits  and promotes lipolysis to decrease lipid deposits by enhancing the activity of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL). The present study further dissects and characterizes the molecular mechanism of IL-4 in regulating HSL expression and lipolytic activity in the terminal differentiated 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes. Our results showed that IL-4 increased cAMP which then enhanced PKA activity and subsequent phosphorylation of HSL and perilipin. The phosphorylated HSL (p-HSL) translocated from cytoplasm to the surface of lipid droplets and exhibited lipolytic function. After being phosphorylated, p-perilipin also facilitated lipolysis through interacting with p-HSL. The in vitro findings were further verified by in vivo study in which IL-4 exhibited pro-lipolytic activity and enhanced HSL activity. In summary, the net outcome of IL-4 treatment is to reduce lipid storage by promoting lipolysis through enhancing HSL activity via cAMP/PKA pathway, the major route leading to lipolysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612177>Perigestational high folic acid: impact on offspring's peripheral metabolic response.</a></h2><p>Offspring of dams exposed to excess folic acid during the perigestational period have been shown by us to be predisposed to metabolic dysfunction revealed by hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, increased insulin and decreased adiponectin in late adulthood. This work aims to characterize adipocyte phenotype and expression profile of genes in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism in visceral adipose tissue and in skeletal muscle. From mating until weaning, a recommended dose of folic acid for pregnancy (C,  mg of folic acid per kg of diet) or a high folic acid dose (HFA, 40 mg of folic acid per kg of diet) was administered to Sprague-Dawley females. At 10 months of age progeny were divided into groups fed the standard chow (C/STD and HFA/STD) and groups fed the standard chow plus drinking water with 10% fructose (C/FRU and HFA/FRU), as an additional metabolic challenge. Adipocyte morphology and quantification of key genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism were studied in visceral adipose tissue and skeletal muscle of 13 months old offspring. HFA exposure led to an enlargement of visceral adipose cells most likely mediated by an upregulation of lipoprotein lipase, and it tended to downregulate Glut4 in visceral adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Fructose exposure in a background of perigestational excess folic acid, but not in controls, induced an upregulation of  pathway genes and it decreased jejunal expression of the proton-coupled folate transporter (Pcft1). In addition, fructose exposure led to a downregulation of jejunal Sglt1 in control animals.

The effects and mechanism of action of PCG on inflammatory responses are determined in adipocyte-conditioned medium (ACM)-cultured macrophages, a cell-to-cell contact system, and a transwell system. The effects of PCG on obesity and obesity-induced inflammatory/oxidant responses are examined in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. PCG effectively suppresses lipid accumulation in adipocytes and adipocyte-induced inflammatory responses in adipocyte-macrophage co-culture systems. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection indicates that the PCG-mediated anti-inflammatory effect is exerted via the nuclear factor erythroid -related factor /Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1(Nrf2/Keap1) pathway. PCG administration results in a significant reduction in body and white adipose tissue (WAT) weights. PCG favorably regulates pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, downregulating nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB).

We thus generated fatty acid-binding protein 4 (Fabp4)-GDF5 transgenic (TG) mice and showed that GDF5 TG mice developed a relative lean phenotype on a high-fat diet (HFD) and showed increased insulin sensitivity. Over expression of GDF5 in adipose tissues greatly promoted the thermogenic process in sWAT after cold or β3-agonist treatment. In TG mice, sWAT showed an important thermogenic effect as the thermogenic gene expression was markedly increased, which was consistent with the typical features of beige adipocytes. Moreover, knockdown of the protein GDF5 impaired browning program in sWAT after thermogenic stimuli. Enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/activating transcription factor  (ATF2) signaling was also identified in sWAT of HFD-fed GDF5 mice, and thermogenesis in mature adipocytes induced by GDF5 protein could be partly blocked by a p38 MAPK inhibitor. Taken together, our data suggest that GDF5 could improve insulin sensitivity and prevent metabolic syndrome, the adaptive thermogenesis in sWAT could mediate the obesity resistance effects of GDF5 in mice and partially resulted in the activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606738>A role for Oncostatin M in the impairment of glucose homeostasis in obesity.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship of OSM with the inflammatory state that leads to impaired glucose homeostasis in obesity. We also assessed whether OSM immunoneutralization could revert metabolic disturbances caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) in mice.28 patients with severe obesity were included and stratified into two groups: 1) glucose levels < 100 mg/dL and ) glucose levels > 100 mg/dL. White adipose tissue was obtained to examine OSM gene expression. Human adipocytes were used to evaluate the effect of OSM in the inflammatory response, and HFD-fed C57BL/6J mice were injected with anti-OSM antibody to evaluate its effects.OSM expression was elevated in subcutaneous and visceral fat from patients with obesity and hyperglycemia, and correlated with Glut4 mRNA levels, serum insulin, HOMA-IR, and inflammatory markers. OSM inhibited  and induced inflammation in human adipocytes. Finally, OSM receptor knockout mice had increased Glut4 mRNA levels in adipose tissue, and OSM immunoneutralization resulted in a reduction of glucose levels and Ccl2 expression in adipose tissue from HFD-fed mice.OSM contributes to the inflammatory state during obesity and may be involved in the development of insulin resistance.© Endocrine Society 2019.

The modulation of gut microbiota, bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis is correlated with obesity-induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the interactions among the gut microbiota, bile acids and FXR in metabolic disorders remained largely unexplored in hamsters. In the current study, hamsters fed a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) were administered vehicle or an antibiotic cocktail by gavage twice a week for four weeks. Antibiotic treatment alleviated HFD-induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis and inflammation accompanied with decreased hepatic  and elevated thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). In the livers of antibiotic-treated hamsters, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1 (CYP7B1) in the alternative bile acid synthesis pathway was upregulated, contributing to a more hydrophilic bile acid profile with increased tauro--muricholic acid (TMCA). The intestinal FXR signaling was suppressed but remained unchanged in the liver. This study is of potential translational significance in determining the role of gut microbiota-mediated bile acid metabolism in modulating diet-induced glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis in the hamster.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31246274>Postnatal triglyceride accumulation is regulated by mineralocorticoid receptor activation under basal and stress conditions.</a></h2><p>Glucocorticoids (GCs) either enhance or reduce obesity in mammals, but limited information exists on the role of corticosteroid receptors in mediating the effect of GCs on lipid metabolism during postnatal development. Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation leads to triglyceride (TG) accumulation post-feeding, whereas glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation reduces TG levels. The TG profile was inversely related to the lipoprotein lipase (lpl) transcript abundance, and this gene was downregulated by MR activation. Cortisol plays an important role in  during postnatal development in zebrafish, and this includes gene/pathway-specific signalling by GR, MR and GR/MR interactions. Ubiquitous MR and GR knockout in zebrafish provides an excellent model to study the mode of action of GCs in regulating lipid metabolism.Glucocorticoids (GCs) act through two receptors, the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which differ in both their affinity to bind GCs and their function. As MR has 10-fold higher affinity for GCs compared to GR, it has been postulated that MR activation occurs at basal levels, while stress levels of these steroid hormones activate GR signalling. There is a growing body of evidence that both these receptors are involved in GC-mediated lipid metabolism. However, the role of GCs in  and lipolysis is controversial, as these steroids appear to both enhance and reduce obesity. As lipid synthesis is a critical part of early development, we hypothesized that both MR and GR contribute to lipid regulation by GCs during postnatal growth. Using MR and GR knockout zebrafish, we demonstrate that MR activation, but not GR activation, is involved in triglyceride (TG) accumulation during the larval development post feeding. Lack of MRs did not affect the gene expression of fatty acid synthase (fas), or acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase  (dgat2), but increased lipoprotein lipase (lpl) transcript abundance. Activation of GR with exogenous cortisol decreased TG levels and increased lpl mRNA levels, but these responses require the presence of MR. Larval transcriptome revealed that MR was the primary regulator of genes involved in lipid synthesis, while GR activation favoured lipid catabolism. Our results underscore a key role for MR activation in mediating postnatal lipid accumulation, as well as cooperatively regulating GR-mediated lipolysis during postnatal stress.© 2019 The Authors.

Despite studies reporting potential interlinks between IDH2 and various diseases, there is lack of effort to comprehensively characterize signature(s) of IDH2 knockout (IDH2 KO) mice. A total of 6583 transcripts were identified from both wild-type (WT) and IDH2 KO mice liver tissues. Afterwards, 167 differentially expressed genes in the IDH2 KO group were short-listed compared to the WT group based on our criteria. The online bioinformatic analyses indicated that lipid metabolism is the most significantly influenced metabolic process in IDH2 KO mice. Moreover, the TR/RXR activation pathway was predicted as the top canonical pathway significantly affected by IDH2 KO. The key transcripts found in the bioinformatic analyses were validated by qPCR analysis, corresponding to the transcriptomics results. Further, an additional qPCR analysis confirmed that IDH2 KO caused a decrease in hepatic de novo  via the activation of the fatty acid β-oxidation process. Our unbiased transcriptomics approach and validation experiments suggested that IDH2 might play a key role in homeostasis of lipid metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668395>MicroRNA-10a-5p regulates macrophage polarization and promotes therapeutic adipose tissue remodeling.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the role of microRNAs generated from adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) during adipose tissue remodeling induced by pharmacological and nutritional stimuli.Macrophage-specific Dicer knockout (KO) mice were used to determine the roles of microRNA generated in macrophages in adipose tissue remodeling induced by the β3-adrenergic receptor agonist CL316,243 (CL). RNA-seq was performed to characterize microRNA and mRNA expression profiles in isolated macrophages and PDGFRα+ adipocyte stem cells (ASCs). The role of miR-10a-5p was further investigated in cell culture, and in adipose tissue remodeling induced by CL treatment and high fat feeding.Macrophage-specific deletion of Dicer elevated pro-inflammatory gene expression and prevented CL-induced de novo beige  in gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT). Co-culture of ASCs with ATMs of wild type mice promoted brown adipocyte gene expression upon differentiation, but co-culture with ATMs of Dicer KO mice did not. Bioinformatic analysis of RNA expression profiles identified miR-10a-5p as a potential regulator of inflammation and differentiation in ATMs and ASCs, respectively. CL treatment increased levels of miR-10a-5p in ATMs and ASCs in gWAT. Interestingly, CL treatment elevated levels of pre-mir-10a in ATMs but not in ASCs, suggesting possible transfer from ATMs to ASCs. Elevating miR-10a-5p levels inhibited proinflammatory gene expression in cultured RAW 264.7 macrophages and promoted the differentiation of C3H10T1/ cells into brown adipocytes. Furthermore, treatment with a miR-10a-5p mimic in vivo rescued CL-induced beige  in Dicer KO mice. High fat feeding reduced miR-10a-5p levels in ATMs of gWAT, and treatment of mice with a miR-10a-5p mimic suppressed pro-inflammatory responses, promoted the appearance of new white adipocytes in gWAT, and improved systemic glucose tolerance.These results demonstrate an important role of macrophage-generated microRNAs in adipogenic niches and identify miR-10a-5p as a key regulator that reduces adipose tissue inflammation and promotes therapeutic .Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

It possesses a wide range of medicinal properties suggesting its potential clinical utility that requires further investigation. The present review intends to highlight the efficacy of kaempferol and its molecular mechanisms of action in regulating bone metabolism. Many reports have acknowledged the bone-protecting property of kaempferol and kaempferol-containing plants using in vitro and in vivo experimental models. Kaempferol supplementation showed bone-sparing effects in newborn rats, glucocorticoid-induced and ovariectomy-induced osteoporotic models as well as bone fracture models. It achieves the bone-protective effects by inhibiting , inflammation, oxidative stress, osteoclastic autophagy and osteoblastic apoptosis while activating osteoblastic autophagy. The anti-osteoporotic effects of kaempferol are mediated through regulation of estrogen receptor, bone morphogenetic protein- (BMP-), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways. In summary, kaempferol exhibits beneficial effects on skeleton, thus is potentially effective for the prophylaxis and treatment of osteoporosis.© 2019 Wong et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31238218>Butylated hydroxyanisole isomers induce distinct  in 3T3-L1 cells.</a></h2><p>Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) isomers, as the widely used anthropogenic antioxidants in food, have been revealed to induce endocrine disrupting effects, while the mechanism how BHA isomers regulate the lipogenic differentiation remains to be elucidated. Using 3T3-L1 differentiation model, the effects of BHA isomers, including -tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole (-BHA), 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole (3-BHA) and their mixture (BHA), on  were tested. The results showed that 3-BHA and BHA promoted adipocyte differentiation and enhanced the cellular lipid accumulation through the regulation of the transcriptional and protein levels of the adipogenetic biomarkers, while -BHA had no effect. The effective window for 3-BHA induced  was the first four days during 3T3-L1 differentiation. BHA isomers showed no binding affinities for peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ). Instead, the upstream of PPARγ signaling pathway, i.e. the phosphorylation of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), upregulation of CAAT/enhancer-binding proteins β (C/EBPβ) and elevated cell proliferation during postconfluent mitosis stage were induced by 3-BHA exposure. Altogether, this study revealed the adipogenic effect of 3-BHA through interference with the upstream events of the PPARγ signaling pathway. The authorized usage of BHA as food additives and its occurrence in human sera can potentially contribute to the incidence of obesity, which is of high concern.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Coffee by-products extracts (31-500 μg mL) and pure phenolics (100 μmol L) reduced lipid accumulation and increased mitochondrial activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Also reduced the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase- and diminished secretion of pro-inflammatory factors in LPS-stimulated RAW2643.7 macrophages. Cytokine release diminished (tumor necrosis factor α: 23-57%; monocyte chemoattractant protein 1: 42-60%; interleukin-6: 30-39%) and adiponectin increased (7-13- fold) in adipocytes treated with macrophage-conditioned media. ROS scavenging and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α pathway counteracted mitochondrial dysfunction.

Behavioral interventions for the treatment of obesity have yet to deliver desired outcomes, thus introducing a pressing need for molecular- and cellular-based therapies. Excess energy from food is stored in the form of triglycerides in white adipose tissue, which expands during weight gain and can lead to insulin resistance and T2D. By contrast, brown adipose tissue (BAT) releases energy from metabolic substrates in the form of heat and secretes factors that can reverse metabolic disease by acting systemically. Therefore, the ability to increase BAT activity is a promising approach to improve energy balance and metabolic homeostasis. Methods are now being developed to generate brown adipocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which would (1) provide an unlimited source of cellular material to study human brown , and () could be used to develop drug- and cell-based therapies for the treatment of metabolic complications associated with obesity.

The intervention of NAFLD can prevent its further development into severe metabolic syndromes. Given the inefficiency and side effects of chemical drugs for treating NAFLD, the hepatic-targeted nanocarriers loaded with bioactive compounds may offer a more effective and acceptable strategy for eliminating NAFLD. Here we developed hepatic-targeted oxidized starch-lysozyme (OSL) nanocarriers to specifically deliver resveratrol (Res) to liver tissue in order to maximize its therapeutic efficiency. The hepatic targeting was achieved using covalently conjugated galactose (Gal), which is recognized by the asialoglycoprotein receptors specifically expressed in hepatocytes. In steatotic HepG2 cell model, treatment with hepatic-targeted Gal-OSL/Res nanocarriers enhanced the cellular Res uptake and anti- capabilities, and effectively decreased triglyceride accumulation by modulating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/silent information regulation  homolog 1(SIRT1)/fatty acid synthase (FAS)/sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP1c) signaling pathway. In mice, Gal-OSL increased Res delivery into liver tissues and increased their hepatic effective concentration in liver. Most importantly, Gal-OSL/Res nanocarriers effectively reversed NAFLD and recovered hepatic insulin sensitivity of NAFLD mice to the healthy state. Furthermore, Gal-OSL/Res efficiently ameliorated lipid deposition and insulin resistance by modulating AMPK/SIRT1/FAS/SREBP1c signaling pathway and downregulated insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) phosphorylation at serine 307 in liver. These findings suggested that the hepatic-targeted Gal-OSL nanocarriers delivering Res could potentially serve as a safe and promising platform for NAFLD and other liver related diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, these methods typically do not inform the contribution of a given substrate to specific pathways on these synthetic processes. We integrated deuterated water (HO) measurement of de novo  (DNL) and glycerol-3-phosphate (GLY) synthesis from all substrates with a C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method that quantifies TG FA and glycerol enrichment from a specific [U-C]precursor. This allowed the [U-C]precursor contribution to DNL and GLY to be estimated. We applied this method in mice to determine the contributions of fructose and glucose supplemented in the drinking water to DNL and GLY in liver, mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT). In liver, fructose contributed significantly more to DNL of saturated fatty acids (SFA) and oleate as well as to GLY compared to glucose. Moreover, its contribution to SFA synthesis was significantly higher compared to that of oleate. MAT and SCAT had lower fractional rates of total DNL and GLY compared to liver and glucose was utilized more predominantly than fructose for TG synthesis in these tissues. This novel HO/C integrated method revealed for the first time, tissue specific selection of substrates for DNL, particularly fructose in regard to glucose in liver. Also, this approach was able to resolve the distribution of specific FAs into the TG sn2 and sn1,3 sites. This stable isotope integrated approach yielded information so far uncovered by other lipidomic tools and should powerfully assist in other nutritional, pathological or environmental contexts.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Recent studies have indicated that the pomegranate (Punica granatum) seed oil (PSO) has many biologically active components that help in controlling diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. However, its impact on the adipogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HADMSC) remains unclear. Here we have attempted to study the anti-obesity potential of SHAMstat3pg, a fatty acid composite extracted from PSO. It is composed of three dietary fatty acids: punicic acid [(9Z,11E,13Z)-9,11,13-Octadecatrienoic acid], oleic acid [Cis-9-Octadecenoic acid], and linoleic acid [(9Z,12Z)-octadeca-9,12-dienoic acid]. In this study, we discuss the impact of the fatty acids on , inflammation, glucose uptake, and mitochondrial ATP production. The impact of SHAMstat3pg on the expression of various obesity-associated protein and mRNA transcripts in HADMSC was also analyzed. The results indicate that exposure to 10 µg/ml of SHAMstat3pg (24 hr) inhibited  of HADMSC, ameliorated inflammation, attenuated ATP production, and glucose uptake. Also, the extract favorably regulated the mRNA expression of the studied obesity-associated gene transcripts. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: SHAMstat3pg has the potential to serve as a multi-targeted therapy for the management of obesity. This study demonstrated that the dietary fatty acids inhibited the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes.

Hedgehog (Hh) pathway plays a vital role in the process of HSCs activation by regulating metabolism, and activation of the Hh pathway promotes transdifferentiation of HSCs into myofibroblasts. Deoxyelephantopin (DET), a naturally occurring sesquiterpene lactone from Elephantopus scaber, has been shown to exert hepatoprotective as well as anticancer effects.

Our results first demonstrated that DET reduced the expression of a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) and a1(I)procollagen at both mRNA and protein levels, and restore  in HSCs. Furthermore, DET decreased the expression of hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase- (PFK2), Glucose transporter 4 (Glut4), and reduced lactate production dose-dependently in HSCs. Moreover, we further revealed that DET reduced fibrotic gene expression, restored lipid accumulation in HSCs. However, the Hh pathway agonist SAG could reverse the above effect of DET.

The prevalence of CVD is closely linked to the prevalence of obesity because obesity is commonly associated with metabolic abnormalities that are important risk factors for CVD, including insulin resistance, pre-diabetes, and type- diabetes, atherosclerotic dyslipidaemia, endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. Women have a more beneficial traditional CVD risk profile (lower fasting plasma glucose, less atherogenic lipid profile) and a lower absolute risk for CVD than men. However, the relative risk for CVD associated with hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia is several-fold higher in women than in men. The reasons for the sex differences in CVD risk associated with metabolic abnormalities are unclear but could be related to differences in the mechanisms that cause hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia in men and women, which could influence the pathogenic processes involved in CVD. In the present paper, we review the influence of a person's sex on key aspects of metabolism involved in the cardiometabolic disease process, including insulin action on endogenous glucose production, tissue glucose disposal, and adipose tissue lipolysis, insulin secretion and insulin plasma clearance, postprandial glucose, fatty acid, and triglyceride kinetics, hepatic lipid metabolism and myocardial substrate use.

Since PPF is rich in phytochemicals with anti-obesity properties, we aimed to investigate the effects of PPF on obesity and its underlying mechanism using a diet-induced obesity model. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed either normal diet, high-fat diet (HFD), or HFD containing 0.% or 0.6% PPF water extract for 8 weeks. PPF significantly reduced body weight, abdominal fat mass, serum glucose, alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, and liver and spleen weights compared to the HFD control group. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that PPF suppressed lipogenic gene expression, including stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 and - and fatty acid synthase, and up-regulated the fatty acid β-oxidation gene, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, in the liver.

Previous studies concluded that these exchanges are incomplete therefore fatty acid H-enrichment requires correcting.  In mice, we measured the H-enrichment of fatty acid positions , 3 and methyl hydrogens from [U-H]glucose to determine H-transfer from glucose to fatty acid via malonyl-CoA, NADPH and acetyl-CoA, respectively.  Positional fatty acid H-enrichments were compared to C-enrichment of the same sites from an equivalent amount of [U-C]glucose provided alongside the [U-H]glucose tracer.                   Transfer of glucose H to fatty acid position  and methyl sites was low (H enrichment of 0.06 ± 0.01 and 0.14 ± 0.01 relative to C) indicating extensive exchange at both malonyl- and acetyl-CoA, respectively.  Transfer of glucose H into fatty acid position 3 was more extensive (0.46 ± 0.04 relative to C, p < 10 versus position ) indicating a more limited exchange of those glucose hydrogens that were transferred via NADPH.  However, mice provided with [U-C]glucose and HO had equivalent H-enrichments of fatty acid positions  and 3 suggesting that in this setting, NADPH and body water H had exchanged extensively. This is explained by contributions of substrates other than exogenous glucose to DNL coupled with their extensive H-enrichment from HO prior to DNL.  Under such conditions, H-enrichment of fatty acids from HO do not need correction.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31264515>A MetAP2 inhibitor blocks , yet improves glucose uptake in cells.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue expansion involves angiogenesis to remodel its capillary network. The enzymemethionine aminopeptidase (MetAP2) promotes angiogenesis.MetAP2 inhibitors suppress angiogenesis and have potential anti-obesity effect. However, impairment in adipose tissue expansion is also linked with impaired glycemic control.This study investigated the effect of BL6, a MetAP2 inhibitor, on  and glucose disposal.To test effect on angiogenesis, Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells(HUVECs) were treated with BL6 for 24h to determine tube formation. Further, to test effect on  and glucose disposal,3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were treated with BL6(0 µM, 20µM, 50 µM or 100µM) during differentiation. Differentiated cells were stained with Oil Red O for determining lipid accumulation, and glucose uptake assay. Protein levels and RNA expression for key genes involved in the adipogenic cascade were determined.BL6 treatment of HUVECs dose dependently blocked angiogenesis. During differentiation of pre-adipocytes, 50μM and 100µM BL6 significantly reduced lipid accumulation. Treatment with 100µM BL6 significantly decreased expression of adipogenic genes. Interestingly, BL6 treatment dose dependently increased glucose uptake by 3T3-L1 cells.MetAP2 inhibitor blocks angiogenesis, attenuates , yet increases cellular glucose uptake. Collectively this proof of concept study supports a possible role for MetAP2 inhibitor BL6, as a putative anti-obesity therapeutic agent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31470288>Gnotobiotic mice inoculated with Firmicutes, but not Bacteroidetes, deteriorate nonalcoholic fatty liver disease severity by modulating hepatic lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a serious liver disorder and characterized by the hepatic accumulation of excess fatty acids. Clinical studies and animal models have shown a shift of gut microbiota from bacteroidetes to firmicutes in NAFLD patients and a diet-induced NAFLD mouse model. Therefore, we hypothesized that these  groups of bacteria may have differential effects on lipid metabolism in the liver, which further contributed to pathogenesis of NAFLD. To elucidate these effects, we inoculated two species of Bacteroidetes (B-group) or five species of Firmicutes (F-group) which were isolated from healthy individuals into germ-free mice. We found that the F-group induced elevated body weight, liver weight, and hepatic steatosis compared to the B-group under high-fat diet (HFD) conditions. The mRNA expression level of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) was elevated in the F-group compared to that in the B-group. Increased mRNA expression levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS), stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase  (DGAT2) were also seen under HFD conditions in the F-group compared to that in the B-group. In addition, the expression level of miR802-5p was only elevated in the F-group under HFD conditions. Taken together, our results suggested that these specific species of Firmicutes may induce more hepatic steatosis by modulating fatty acid influx and  compared to those of Bacteroidetes. These results may provide more understanding of the effects of gut microbiota on NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The mechanisms by which hydrogen sulfide (H2S), an endogenous gasotransmitter, regulates lipid metabolism remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate if the protective effects of H2S during high glucose (HG)‑induced lipid accumulation in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes may be mediated by AMP‑activated protein kinase (AMPK). Triglyceride (TG) content and the production of H2S were determined using  colorimetric assay kits and H2S synthesis methods. The levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein‑1 and adiponectin were evaluated by ELISA. Total AMPK and phosphorylated AMPK levels were assessed by western blot analysis. HG increased the cellular level of TG and decreased H2S production in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes. The H2S donor, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) protected against the HG‑induced accumulation of TG in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, NaHS suppressed HG‑induced TG accumulation by activating AMPK. Collectively, the findings of the present study suggested that HG induced lipid accumulation in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes, and AMPK activation may underlie the lipid‑lowering effects of H2S.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31233505>Adenovirus-mediated expression of SIK1 improves hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in type  diabetes mellitus rats.</a></h2><p>In this study, we investigated the role and mechanism of Salt-induced kinase 1 (SIK1) in regulation of hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in a high-fat food (HFD) and streptozocin (STZ)-induced type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rat model.A diabetic rat model treated with HFD plus low-dose STZ was developed and was transduced to induce a high expression of SIK1 in vivo via a tail-vein injection of a recombinant adenoviral vector. The effects on hepatic glucogenetic and lipogenic gene expression, systemic metabolism and pathological changes were then determined.In T2DM rats, SIK1 expression was reduced in the liver. Overexpression of SIK1 improved hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia and fatty liver, reduced the expression of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription co-activator  (CRTC2), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), pS577 SIK1, sterol regulatory element binding-protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and its target genes, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS), and increased the expression of SIK1, pT182 SIK1 and pS171 CRTC2 in diabetic rat livers with the suppression of gluconeogenesis and lipid deposition.SIK1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism in the livers of HFD/STZ-induced T2DM rats, where it suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis and  by regulating the SIK1/CRTC2 and SIK1/SREBP-1c signalling pathways.

Studies have shown that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has a protective effect against irradiation, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we used a TLR4 knockout (TLR4) mouse irradiation model and found that the white blood cell and platelet counts in the peripheral blood of TLR4 mice recovered slowly after irradiation, with bone marrow hyperplasia and increased mortality. Additionally, we found that the proportion of CD11bGr1 granulocytes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow of TLR4 mice was lower than that of wild-type mice after irradiation. Further, we found that the expression of NADPH Oxidases (NOXs) in the bone marrow was down-regulated after irradiation of TLR4 mice, and administration of the NOXs inhibitor VAS2870 reduced the proportion of CD11bGr1 cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of wild-type mice after irradiation. Irradiation induced severe marrow adipocytes accumulation in TLR4 mice, TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide promoted proliferation and inhibited adipogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells. In summary, our data suggest that TLR4 promotes myeloid hyperplasia by up-regulating the expression of NOXs after irradiation, prohibits marrow adipogensis and increases the tolerance of mice to irradiation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

There is evidence that biological effects of adropin are mediated via GPR19 activation. Animal studies showed that adropin modulates adiposity as well as lipid and glucose homeostasis. Adropin deficient animals have a phenotype closely resembling that of human metabolic syndrome with are obesity dyslipidemia and impaired glucose production. Animals treated with exogenous adropin lose weight, in addition to having reduced expression of lipogenic genes in the liver and fat tissue. While it was shown that adropin may contribute to energy homeostasis and body weight regulation, the role of this protein in controlling fat tissue formation is largely unknown. Thus, in the present study we investigated the effects of adropin on  using 3T3-L1 cells and rat primary preadipocytes. We found a low Enho mRNA expression in 3T3-L1 cells and rat primary preadipocytes. Adropin stimulated proliferation of 3T3-L1 cells and rat primary preadipocytes. Stimulation of 3T3-L1 cell proliferation was mediated via ERK1/ and AKT. Adropin reduced lipid accumulation as well as expression of proadipogenic genes in 3T3-L1 cells and rat preadipocytes, suggesting that this protein attenuates differentiation of preadipocytes into mature fat cells. In summary, these results show that adropin modulates proliferation and differentiation of preadipocytes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Myofibroblasts are the effector cells that excessively deposit extracellular matrix proteins thus compromising lung structure and function. Emerging literature suggests a correlation between fibrosis and metabolic alterations in IPF. In this study, we show that the first-line antidiabetic drug metformin exerts potent antifibrotic effects in the lung by modulating metabolic pathways, inhibiting TGFβ1 action, suppressing collagen formation, activating PPARγ signaling and inducing lipogenic differentiation in lung fibroblasts derived from IPF patients. Using genetic lineage tracing in a murine model of lung fibrosis, we show that metformin alters the fate of myofibroblasts and accelerates fibrosis resolution by inducing myofibroblast-to-lipofibroblast transdifferentiation. Detailed pathway analysis revealed a two-arm mechanism by which metformin accelerates fibrosis resolution.

In this study, we found that Tmem18 was significantly downregulated in rat BMSCs after osteogenic induction. TMEM18 overexpression remarkably downregulated osteo-specific genes including alkaline phosphatase (Alp), Runt-related transcription factor  (Runx2), osteocalcin (Ocn), and osteopontin (Opn), and reduced the number of mineral deposits and ALP activity in vitro, whereas knockdown of Tmem18 yielded the opposite results. In vivo assays also indicated that TMEM18 knockdown BMSCs have an increased bone formation potential in a rat model of calvarial defects. Analyses of the mechanism suggested that TMEM18 overexpression decreased β-catenin expression, whereas the TMEM18 knockdown enhanced β-catenin expression and promoted its nuclear translocation. The positive effects on osteogenic differentiation of rat BMSCs owing to the TMEM18 knockdown were attenuated by β-catenin downregulation.

In rodent models of NAFLD, treatment with a surrogate of TVB-2640, a pharmacological inhibitor of FAS (FASi), has been shown to reduce hepatic fat and other biomarkers of DNL. The purpose of this Phase I clinical study was to test the effect of the TVB-2640 in obese men with certain metabolic abnormalities that put them at risk for NAFLD. Twelve subjects (mean±SE, 42±2y, BMI 37.4±1. kg/m , glucose 103± mg/dL, TG 196±27 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes) underwent 10 days of treatment with TVB-2640 at doses ranging from 50-150 mg/d. Food intake was controlled throughout the study. Hepatic DNL was measured before and after an oral fructose/glucose (F/G) bolus using isotopic labeling with 1- C -acetate IV infusion, followed by measurement of labeled VLDL-palmitate via GC/MS. Substrate oxidation was measured by indirect calorimetry. Across the range of doses, fasting DNL was reduced by up to 90% (P=0.003). Increasing plasma concentrations of TVB-2640 were associated with progressive reductions in the percent of fructose-stimulated peak fractional DNL (R = - 0.749, P=0.0003) and absolute DNL AUC 6h post F/G bolus (R = - 0.409, P=0.025). For all subjects combined, ALT was reduced by 15.8±8.4% (P=0.05). Substrate oxidation was unchanged and safety monitoring revealed that the drug was well tolerated, without an increase in plasma triglycerides. Alopecia occurred in two subjects (reversed after stopping the drug), but otherwise no changes were observed in fasting glucose, insulin, ketones, and renal function. These data support the therapeutic potential of FASi, TVB-2640 in particular, in patients with NAFLD and NASH.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31292295>Lipoatrophy and metabolic disturbance in mice with adipose-specific deletion of kindlin-.</a></h2><p>Kindlin- regulates integrin-mediated cell adhesion to and migration on the extracellular matrix.

In this study, we generated adipose tissue-specific conditional knockout of kindlin- in mice by using Adipoq-Cre BAC-transgenic mice. The results showed that deleting kindlin- expression in adipocytes in mice caused a severe lipodystrophy with drastically reduced adipose tissue mass. Kindlin- ablation elevated the blood levels of nonesterified fatty acids and triglycerides, resulting in massive fatty livers in the mutant mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD). Furthermore, HFD-fed mutant mice displayed type II diabetes-like phenotypes, including elevated levels of fasting blood glucose, glucose intolerance, and peripheral insulin resistance. Kindlin- loss dramatically reduced the expression levels of multiple key factors, including PPARγ, mTOR, AKT, and β-catenin proteins, and suppressed adipocyte gene expression and differentiation. Finally, kindlin- loss drastically reduced leptin production and caused a high bone mass phenotype.

Their role in the reduction of lipid deposits in liver tissue is not unequivocal. CLA contain an equimolar mixture of two isomers of linoleic acid: trans-10,cis-12 CLA and cis-9,trans-11. Only one isomer - trans-10,cis-12 CLA exhibits fat-reducing properties, cis-9,trans-11 CLA does not. The main goal of this study was to determine if CLA isomers affect the activation of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) in liver cells and tissue. FoxO1 is a protein that plays a crucial role in regulation of lipid and carbohydrates metabolism. In vitro and in vivo models of our study were HepG2 cells and C57BL/6J mice. Methods used in the study were qPCR - quantification of FoxO1 gene expression, Western blot - posttranslational phosphorylation of FoxO1, Oil Red O (ORO) - lipid staining and ELISA - quantification of apoB100. In both models trans-10,cis-12 CLA diminished FoxO1 gene expression: decrease by 44.1 ± 20.9% SD in the cells and 65.4 ± 29.8% SD in mice. The lowest accumulation of lipids (drop of 37. ± 1.7% SD) and the highest increase of apoB100 protein (74 ± 12.8% SD) were detected in the medium of cells cultured with trans-10,cis-12 CLA. Both isomers of linoleic acid have different effects on lipid metabolism. Isomer c9,t11 CLA accelerates , whereas isomer t10,c12 CLA activates secretion of lipids in HepG2 cells. In contrast to the in vitro study, unfortunately this pro-health property of t10,c12 CLA was not confirmed in the in vivo model.

Its cellular and molecular investigation in humans is hampered by the limited availability of cell material and the heterogeneity of BAT between and within individuals. In this study, monoclonal lines of conditionally immortalized brown preadipocytes (iBPAs) of mouse and human origin were generated. Conditional immortalization was achieved by doxycycline-controlled expression of simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (LT) with a repressor-based Tet-On system. In the presence of doxycycline, both the murine and human cell lines showed long-term proliferation capacity with a population doubling time of ~28 h. After switching off LT expression by doxycycline removal and exposure to adipogenic differentiation medium, cells from both species acquired brown adipocyte properties. This was evidenced by the accumulation of multilocular lipid droplets, the upregulation of brown adipocyte markers including uncoupling protein 1 and an increase in lipolysis and oxygen consumption following adrenergic stimulation. Switching off LT expression before the onset of adipogenic differentiation was only critical for inducing  in the human iBPAs, while their murine counterparts showed  upon exposure to the adipogenic differentiation cocktail regardless of LT expression. When switched to proliferation medium, cultures of adipogenically differentiated human iBPAs de-differentiated and resumed cell division without losing their adipogenic capacity. We suggest that iBPAs represent an easy-to-use model for fundamental and applied research into BAT offering unique experimental opportunities due to their capacity to switch between proliferative and differentiated states.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the effect of zaluzanin C on differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes.The cytotoxicity of zaluzanin C and its effect on cell proliferation was determined. For the induction of adipocyte differentiation, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with differentiating medium containing 10 μg/mL insulin, 115 μg/mL methylisobutylxanthine, and 1 μM dexamethasone. Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were subjected to Oil red O solution or used for Western blot analysis. Zaluzanin C was added to the cell culture medium at concentrations of 0, 1, .5, 5, and 10 μM.Zaluzanin C did not inhibit cell proliferation and showed no cytotoxicity at 10 μM concentration in 3T3-L1 cells. Therefore, concentration range of 0-10 μM zaluzanin C was used for subsequent experiments. Zaluzanin C inhibited accumulation of lipid droplets in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To understand the underlying mechanism of zaluzanin C, expression of  regulators was determined by Western blot analysis. Zaluzanin C suppressed peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) expression, an  related transcription factor, and inhibited aP2/fatty acid-binding protein-4 expression, a target gene of PPARγ. However, it did not affect expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha related with acquisition of insulin sensitivity.These data suggest that inhibitory effect of zaluzanin C on  of 3T3-L1 adipocytes could be partially caused by suppressing PPARγ.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31379157>Role of Adenosine Monophosphate Deaminase during Fatty Acid Accumulation in Oleaginous Fungus .</a></h2><p>In oleaginous micro-organisms, nitrogen limitation activates adenosine monophosphate deaminase (AMPD) and promotes  via the inhibition of isocitrate dehydrogenase. We found that the overexpression of homologous  in  favored lipid synthesis over cell growth. Total fatty acid content in the recombinant strain was 15.0-34.3% higher than that in the control, even though their biomass was similar. During the early fermentation stage, the intracellular AMP level reduced by 40-60%, together with a 1.9-.7-fold increase in citrate content compared with the control, therefore provided more precursors for fatty acid synthesis. Moreover, the decreased AMP level resulted in metabolic reprogramming, reflected by the blocked TCA cycle and reduction of amino acids, distributing more carbon to lipid synthesis pathways.

Under excess energy conditions, TG is synthesized by acylation of diacylglycerol (DG), whereas TG is broken down into DG and free fatty acid, which provide energy for mitochondrial lipid oxidation when needed. In this regard, DG is not merely an intermediate metabolite for TG metabolism; it also serves as a signaling molecule. DG kinase (DGK) phosphorylates DG to produce phosphatidic acid (PA). Consequently, DGK plays a pivotal role in the control of lipid metabolism and signal transduction pathway. Recently, a report has described that DGKε-knockout (KO) mice show expansion of epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) together with the impairment of glucose clearance after short-term (40 days) high fat diet (HFD) feeding, an early presymptomatic phase of obesity in wild-type animals. Nevertheless, no report describes an investigation of their phenotype under long-term HFD feeding conditions. Remarkably, results obtained during long-term HFD feeding show that WAT mass is decreased significantly and that the blood glucose profile in response to glucose challenge is improved in DGKε-KO mice compared with wild-type, which contrast sharply against the phenotype shown for short-term HFD feeding. Morphological examination reveals that cyclooxygenase- (COX-) expression and clusters of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-positive multilocular brown-like ("beige") adipocyte are induced in DGKε-deficient WAT after long-term HFD feeding, suggesting that beige adipocytes facilitate energy expenditure during prolonged HFD feeding. Administration of celecoxib, a selective inhibitor of COX-, abolishes the appearance of UCP1-positive beige adipocytes in DGKε-KO mice. These findings suggest that DGKε deficiency promotes visceral WAT remodeling in a COX--dependent manner under long-term HFD feeding conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

On days 14 and 21, the animals were euthanized, and the lungs were examined through protein expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), IL-17, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelin-1, and the immunogenic Col V through histological quantitative evaluation and plasma levels of fibrinogen, Von Willebrand factor, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Rats that had been injected with MSCs and CM showed a significant increase in weight and significant improvements at 14 and 21 days after intravenous injection at both time points of analysis of plasma fibrinogen, PDGF, and Von Willebrand factor and NOS- expression, supporting an early anti-inflammatory action, thus reducing TGF-β and collagen I fibers. In contrast, intravenous injection of CM was able to significantly increase the deposition of Col V fibers and IL-17 on both day 14 and day 21 as compared with the amount observed in rats from the BLM group and MSC groups. In conclusion, this study reinforces previous observations on the therapeutic properties of MSCs and CM and is the first report to demonstrate the association of its actions with immunomodulatory biomarkers on lung tissue. We concluded that adipose-derived stem cells and adipose-derived stem cells-CM modulate an in situ imbalance between collagen I- and Col V-mediated IL-17 immune response, emerging as a promising therapeutic option for recovering from BLM pulmonary fibrosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31430278>Promotion of  by JMJD6 requires the AT hook-like domain and is independent of its catalytic function.</a></h2><p>JMJD6 is a member of the Jumonji C domain containing enzymes that demethylate and/or hydroxylate substrate proteins. It is a multi-functional protein that has been implicated in disparate aspects of transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of gene expression, including but not limited to enhancer and promoter binding, release of paused RNA polymerase II, control of splicing, and interaction with the translation machinery. JMJD6 contributes to multiple aspects of animal development, including  modeled in culture. We mutated proposed or characterized domains in the JMJD6 protein to better understand the requirement for JMJD6 in adipogenic differentiation. Mutation of JMJD6 amino acids that mediate binding of iron and -oxogluterate, which are required cofactors for enzymatic activity, had no impact on JMJD6 function, showing that catalytic activity is not required for JMJD6 contributions to adipogenic differentiation. In addition, we documented the formation of JMJD6 oligomers and showed that catalytic activity is not required for oligomerization, as has been reported previously. We also observed no effect of mutations in the sumoylation site and in the poly-serine stretch. In contrast, mutation of the AT hook-like structure, which mediates interaction with DNA and/or RNA, compromised JMJD6 function by blocking its ability to interact with chromatin at genes that express regulators of . The ability of JMJD6 to interact with nucleic acids may be a critical requirement for its function in adipogenic differentiation. The requirement for the AT hook-like domain and the lack of requirement for catalytic activity giving rise to the idea that co-activation of transcription by JMJD6 may be functioning as a scaffold protein that supports the interactions of other critical regulators.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31420057>Effects of oral Nigella sativa oil on the expression levels and serum concentrations of adiponectin, PPAR-γ, and TNF-α in overweight and obese women: a study protocol for a crossover-designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a major public health problem in recent decades. The accumulation of excessive fat promotes inflammatory status. Meanwhile, herbal products are marketed for their weight-loss properties, such as Nigella sativa (N. Sativa) which has been used for centuries to treat rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and asthma; recently, the anti-obesity characteristics of N. sativa have also been indicated. However, the exact mechanisms and cellular-related pathways are still unclear. Thus, we will aim to assess the effects of oral N. sativa on the gene expression of inflammatory and -related factors, including TNF-α, PPAR-γ, and adiponectin as well as assessing their serum concentrations among obese and overweight individuals.Obese and overweight women aged 25-55 years with a body mass index (BMI) of 25-35 kg/m will be recruited from the Obesity Clinic in Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences and will be assessed for eligibility against inclusion criteria. They will be randomly assigned into two groups to receive either two capsules of N. sativa or two capsules of placebo per day for eight weeks (each capsule contains 1000 mg of N. sativa or placebo). There will be a four-week wash-out period and then participants will receive the reverse supplements for another eight weeks. Biochemical assessments and gene expressions (using real-time polymerase chain reaction) will be conducted at the beginning and at the end of every intervention period.The present study will investigate the probable cellular pathways for the anti-obesity effects of N. sativa in overweight/obese women.Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials, IRCT20180528039884N1 .

Even without chemical supplementation, mechanical stimulation by shear stress may help to induce the desired differentiation. The cell format, such as three-dimensional (3D) microtissues (MTs), MT-derived cells or single cells (SCs), may have a pivotal impact as well. Here, we studied modulation of gene expression in human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) exposed to shear stress and/or after MT formation.Electrospun meshes of poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid and amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticles (PLGA/aCaP) at a weight ratio of 60:40 were seeded with human ASCs as MTs or as SCs and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without chemical supplementation. After  weeks of static culture, the scaffolds were cultured statically for another  weeks or placed in a Bose® bioreactor with a flow rate per area of 0.16 mL cm min. Stiffness of the scaffolds was assessed as a function of time. After 4 weeks, minimum stem cell criteria markers and selected markers of osteogenesis, endothelial cell differentiation,  and chondrogenesis were analysed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Additionally, cell distribution within the scaffolds and the allocation of the yes-associated protein (YAP) in the cells were assessed by immunohistochemistry.MTs decayed completely within  weeks after seeding on PLGA/aCaP. The osteogenic marker gene alkaline phosphatase and the endothelial cell marker gene CD31 were upregulated in MT-derived ASCs compared with SCs. Shear stress realised by fluid flow perfusion upregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma  expression in MT-derived ASCs and in SCs. The nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio of YAP expression was doubled under perfusion compared with that under static culture for MT-derived ASCs and SCs.Osteogenic and angiogenic commitments were more pronounced in MT-derived ASCs seeded on bone biomimetic electrospun nanocomposite PLGA/aCaP than in SCs seeded without induction medium. Furthermore, the static culture was superior to the perfusion regimen used here, as shear stress resulted in adipogenic commitment for MT-derived ASCs and SCs, although the YAP nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio indicated higher cell tensions under perfusion, usually associated with preferred osteogenic differentiation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, targeting the aberrant lipogenic activity could be developed therapeutically in PCa. The aim of this study is to investigate the molecular basis and efficacy of osajin, a bioactive prenylated isoflavonoid, in PCa.PCa cells, LNCaP (androgen-sensitive) and C4- (androgen-insensitive/castration-resistant), were used in this study. Proliferation, migration, and invasion analyses were conducted by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol--yl)-,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method, a wound healing assay, and the transwell method.  was determined by a Fatty Acid Quantification Kit and oil red O staining. Apoptosis was assessed by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining, caspase enzymatic activity, and Western blot analyses.Osajin inhibited fatty acid synthase (FASN) expression, a key enzyme for , in PCa cells. By inhibiting FASN, osajin decreased the fatty-acid levels and lipid accumulation. Significantly, osajin downregulated androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in PCa cells. Moreover, osajin suppressed PCa cell growth, migration, and invasion. Through activation of the caspase-dependent pathway, osajin induced apoptosis in PCa cells.These data provide a novel molecular basis of osajin in PCa cells, and cotargeting  and the AR axis via impairment of FASN and AR expression by osajin could be applied as a new and promising approach for the treatment of malignant PCa.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557368>MicroRNA-130a controls bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell differentiation towards the osteoblastic and adipogenic fate.</a></h2><p>With age, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) have reduced ability of differentiating into osteoblasts but have increased ability of differentiating into adipocytes which leads to age-related bone loss. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play major roles in regulating BMSC differentiation. This paper explored the role of miRNAs in regulating BMSC differentiation swift fate in age-related osteoporosis.Mice and human BMSC were isolated from bone marrow, whose miR-130a level was measured. The abilities of BMSC differentiate into osteoblast or fat cell under the transfected with agomiR-130a or antagomiR-130a were analysed by the level of ALP, osteocalcin, Runx2, osterix or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorγ (PPARγ), Fabp4. Related mechanism was verified via qT-PCR, Western blotting (WB) and siRNA transfection. Animal phenotype intravenous injection with agomiR-130a or agomiR-NC was explored by Micro-CT, immunochemistry and calcein double-labelling.MiR-130a was dramatically decreased in BMSC of advanced subjects. Overexpression of miR-130a increased osteogenic differentiation of BMSC and attenuated adipogenic differentiation in BMSC, conversely, Inhibition of miR-130a reduced osteogenic differentiation and facilitated lipid droplet formation. Consistently, overexpression of miR-130a in elderly mice dropped off the bone loss. Furthermore, the protein levels of Smad regulatory factors  (Smurf2) and PPARγ were regulated by miR-130a with an negative effect through directly combining the 3'UTR of Smurf2 and PPARγ.The results indicated that miR-130a promotes osteoblastic differentiation of BMSC by negatively regulating Smurf2 expression and suppresses adipogenic differentiation of BMSC by targeting the PPARγ, and supply a new target for clinical therapy of age-related bone loss.© 2019 The Authors.

They include an antilipogenic action that could have an impact on excessive fat accumulation and obesity-related metabolic alterations. We evaluated the metabolic effects of an oral PHE treatment on mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Eleven-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were fed a HFD and either a 0.028% PHE solution (HFD + PHE) or water to drink for 11 weeks. PHE attenuated the increase in body weight and adiposity without affecting food consumption. Energy efficiency was lower in HFD + PHE mice. Lipid content was reduced in subcutaneous fat pads, liver, and skeletal muscle. In white adipose tissue (WAT), PHE reduced sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA levels, inhibited amine-induced , and did not increase lipolysis. Moreover, HFD + PHE mice presented diminished levels of hydrogen peroxide release in subcutaneous WAT and reduced expression of leukocyte transmigration markers and proinflammatory cytokines in visceral WAT and liver. PHE reduced the circulating levels of glycerol, triacylglycerols, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and insulin. Insulin resistance was reduced, without affecting glucose levels and glucose tolerance. In contrast, PHE increased rectal temperature and slightly increased energy expenditure. The mitigation of HFD-induced metabolic disturbances points toward a promising role for PHE in obesity treatment and encourages further research on its mechanisms of action. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Phenelzine reduces body fat, markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and insulin resistance in high-fat diet mice. Semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase, monoamine oxidase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c are involved in the metabolic effects of phenelzine. Phenelzine could be potentially used for the treatment of obesity-related complications.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31430456>Pinolenic acid ameliorates oleic acid-induced  and oxidative stress via AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Pinolenic acid (PLA), a natural compound isolated from pine nut oil, has been reported to exert bioactivity against lipid anabolism. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanisms still poorly elucidated. The aim of this study is to comprehensively demonstrate the effects of PLA on oleic acid (OA)-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and their relationship with the lipid metabolic regulation. The results demonstrated that treatment with PLA dramatically inhibited lipid accumulation, oxidative stress as well as inflammatory responses induced by oleic acid in HepG2 cells. PLA also obviously decreased the levels of cellular triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO). As well as PLA stilled promoted the antioxidant enzymes activity including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). Furthermore, PLA could increase the expressions of nuclear factor erythroid--related factor  (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase1 (HO-1) to alleviate oxidative damage. It also could reduce -related transcription factors expression, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1c), fatty acid synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). PLA treatment resulted in increasing phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) expression. However, pretreatment with compound C (inhibitor of AMPK) inhibited the effect of PLA on promoting the expression of p-AMPK, SIRT1 and PPARα for lipolysis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PLA possessed the potential to prevent lipid accumulation in OA-induced HepG2 cells via upregulating the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway, which supported the development of new drug candidate against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Serum lipids (406 from 18 classes) were quantified using mass spectrometry from baseline samples when iothalamate-based glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was at least 90 mL/min. Affymetrix GeneChip Array was used to measure renal transcript expression. DKD progression was defined as at least 40% decline in GFR during follow-up.RESULTSParticipants had a mean age of 45 ± 9 years and median urine albumin/creatinine ratio of 43 (interquartile range 11-144). The 32 progressors had significantly higher relative abundance of polyunsaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs) and a lower abundance of C16-C20 acylcarnitines (ACs) (P < 0.001). In a Cox regression model, the main effect terms of unsaturated free fatty acids and phosphatidylethanolamines and the interaction terms of C16-C20 ACs and short-low-double-bond TAGs by categories of albuminuria independently predicted DKD progression. Renal expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase-encoding gene (ACACA) correlated with serum diacylglycerols in the glomerular compartment (r = 0.36, and P = 0.006) and with low-double-bond TAGs in the tubulointerstitial compartment (r = 0.52, and P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONCollectively, the findings reveal a previously unrecognized link between lipid markers of impaired mitochondrial β-oxidation and enhanced  and DKD progression in individuals with preserved GFR. Renal acetyl-CoA carboxylase activation accompanies these lipidomic changes and suggests that it may be the underlying mechanism linking lipid abnormalities to DKD progression.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov, .FUNDINGNIH R24DK082841, K08DK106523, R03DK121941, P30DK089503, P30DK081943, and P30DK020572.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480627>Lyophilized Maqui () Berry Induces Browning in the Subcutaneous White Adipose Tissue and Ameliorates the Insulin Resistance in High Fat Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>Maqui () berry features a unique profile of anthocyanidins that includes high amounts of delphinidin-3-O-sambubioside-5-O-glucoside and delphinidin-3-O-sambubioside and has shown positive effects on fasting glucose and insulin levels in humans and murine models of type  diabetes and obesity. The molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of maqui on the onset and development of the obese phenotype and insulin resistance was investigated in high fat diet-induced obese mice supplemented with a lyophilized maqui berry. Maqui-dietary supplemented animals showed better insulin response and decreased weight gain but also a differential expression of genes involved in de novo , fatty acid oxidation, multilocular lipid droplet formation and thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT). These changes correlated with an increased expression of the carbohydrate response element binding protein b (), the sterol regulatory binding protein 1c () and Cellular repressor of adenovirus early region 1A-stimulated genes 1 () and an improvement in the fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) signaling. Our evidence suggests that maqui dietary supplementation activates the induction of fuel storage and thermogenesis characteristic of a brown-like phenotype in scWAT and counteracts the unhealthy metabolic impact of an HFD.

Besides muscle, the liver has an essential role in regulating glucose homeostasis. Previous studies have reported that treatment of diet-induced obese (DIO) male mice with adropin (the putative secreted domain) reduces fasting blood glucose independently of body weight changes, suggesting that adropin suppresses glucose production in the liver. Here, we explored the molecular mechanisms underlying adropin's effects on hepatic glucose metabolism in DIO mice. Male DIO B6 mice maintained on a high-fat diet received five intraperitoneal injections of adropin (450 nmol/kg/injection) over a 48-h period. We found that adropin enhances major intracellular signaling activities in the liver that are involved in insulin-mediated regulation of glucose homeostasis. Moreover, treatment with adropin alleviated endoplasmic reticulum stress responses and reduced activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinase in the liver, explaining the enhanced activities of hepatic insulin signaling pathways observed with adropin treatment. Furthermore, adropin suppressed cAMP activated protein kinase A (PKA) activities, resulting in reduced phosphorylation of inositol trisphosphate receptor, which mediates endoplasmic reticulum calcium efflux, and of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, a key transcription factor in hepatic regulation of glucose metabolism. Adropin directly affected liver metabolism, decreasing glucose production and reducing PKA-mediated phosphorylation in primary mouse hepatocytes  Our findings indicate that major hepatic signaling pathways contribute to the improved glycemic control achieved with adropin treatment in situations of obesity.© 2019 Gao et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31256364>Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) suppresses high Ca-enhanced  in bone marrow stromal cells.</a></h2><p>We have previously reported that increased extracellular and intracellular Ca lead to adipocyte accumulation in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs).

Estrogen replacement protects against postmenopausal obesity but increases the risks of carcinogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the effects of long-term treatment of raloxifene (RAL), a selective estrogen receptor modulator, on the features of estrogen deficiency-induced obesity and explored the involvement of canonical and non-canonical Wnt regulation in vivo and in vitro.Adult female rats received bilateral OVX and divided into 5 groups: (1) Sham, () OVX, (3) OVX + E: OVX rats were administered with E (50 μg/kg, s.c., 3 times/week), (4) OVX + RAL: OVX rats were treated with RAL (gavage, 1 mg/kg/day) suspended in 0.8% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), (5) OVX + CMC: 0.8% CMC as vehicle control. All treatments were given for 8 weeks beginning at 1 week after OVX. In 3 T3-L1 cells, the effects of RAL on  and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation were evaluated.Treatment with RAL significantly decreased body weight, visceral fat pad mass, adipocyte size and plasma levels of glucose but increased plasma adiponectin. RAL reduced the elevation of HIF-1α, VEGF-A and proinflammatory cytokines (MCP-1 and TNF-α) expression by inhibition of NF-κB p65 and JNK cascades in retroperitoneal WAT. This anti-inflammatory capacity of RAL may result from upregulation of secreted frizzle-related protein 5 (SFRP5), an adipokine that repressed Wnt5a signaling. Furthermore, RAL inhibited adipogenic factors such as PPAR-γ, C/EBP-α, and FABP4, and preserved canonical Wnt10b/β-catenin protein expression. In 3 T3-L1 adipocytes, RAL (20 μM) diminished lipid accumulation and inhibited adipogenic factors accompanied with the induction of β-catenin, which were effectively reversed by the β-catenin inhibitor IWR-1-endo. In addition, RAL reduced LPS-induced NF-κB p65 and p-IκB expression as well as TNF-α secretion. Suppression of SFRP5 by small interfering RNA significantly abrogated the anti-inflammatory effects of RAL.Distinct activation of canonical β-catenin on inhibition of  and non-canonical SFRP5 on suppression of WAT inflammation may contribute to the beneficial effects of RAL. Therefore, this study provides a rationale for the therapeutic potential of RAL for postmenopausal obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31541119>-Aminoadipic acid (-AAA) as a potential biomarker for insulin resistance in childhood obesity.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance is an important clinical feature of metabolic syndrome, which includes obesity and type  diabetes. Increased adipose energy storage in obesity promote insulin resistance and other metabolic adverse effects. To identify a new link between adipocyte and insulin resistance, we performed targeted metabolite profiling of differentiated adipocytes and studied the association between adipogenic metabolites and insulin resistance. We found a correlation between -aminoadipic acid (-AAA) and adipogenic differentiation. Also, circulatory -AAA was positively associated with obesity-related factors (fat mass, fat percent, waist circumference, BMI, BMI z-score, triglycerides, insulin, and HOMA-IR) at baseline and after  years in the children cohort study. Of these factors, increased BMI z-score and HOMA-IR were the primary independent factors associated with higher -AAA levels, and the baseline -AAA level was an indicator of the BMI z-score after  years. To validate the relationship between -AAA and obesity-related factors, we analyzed changes in -AAA levels following obesity intervention programs in two independent studies. In both studies, changes in -AAA levels during the intervention period were positively correlated with changes in the BMI z-score and HOMA-IR after adjusting for confounders. Moreover, the -AAA levels were increased in cell and mouse models of obesity-related insulin resistance. Excess -AAA levels led to impaired insulin signaling in insulin-sensitive cells (liver, skeletal muscle and adipose cells) and caused abnormal gluconeogenesis. Our results demonstrate that -AAA is associated with  and insulin resistance. In this regard, -AAA could be a potential biomarker of obesity and obesity-related metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31354029>Human chromatin remodeler cofactor, RNA interactor, eraser and writer sperm RNAs responding to obesity.</a></h2><p>In the United States almost 33% of adults are considered obese (BMI > 30 kg/m).

Here, the association between CKD and sarcopenic obesity were investigated. The 5/6 nephrectomy was performed to establish CKD in mice. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), quantitative real-time PCR, ELISA kits assay, immunohistochemistry, and cell proliferation assay were carried out to investigate the condition of muscle loss and fatty infiltration were in CKD mice and the origin of adipocytes. Muscle atrophy occurred and adipogenic gene expression, Perilipin and FABP4 were markedly increased in the hind limb muscle of CKD mice. Results indicated that fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) are the precursor of adipocytes in the muscle of CKD mice. Meanwhile, the content of extracellular matrix protein CCN1 was notably increased in serum of CKD patients with sarcopenic obesity which was also found in muscle and serum of CKD mice. CCN1 induced the differentiation of FAPs into adipocytes. These results suggest that CKD mice are susceptible to sarcopenic obesity.

Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats received 20% fructose in drinking water (10 treated with allopurinol and 10 received vehicle) and 10 control rats received tap water. After 14 days, the hepatic response to an acute fructose load was evaluated, and in fasted animals, respirometry studies in freshly isolated mitochondria were performed. In fasting rats, we did not find differences in systemic or hepatic uric acid and triglyceride concentrations among the groups, but mitochondrial respiratory control rate was significantly decreased by high fructose feeding and correlated with a reduced expression of Complex I, as well as decreased aconitase- activity. On the other hand, in fructose fed rats, an acute fructose load increased systemic and hepatic uric acid, triglycerides and oxidative stress. Fructose feeding was also associated with fructokinase and xanthine oxidase overexpression and increased liver de novo  program (fatty acid synthase (FAS) and cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector C (CIDEC) overexpression, ATP citrate lyase (ACL) and acetyl coA carboxylase (ACC) overactivity and decreased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPk) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation).

We elucidated  in pigs using transcriptome analysis. Preadipocytes from subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of Landrace piglets were differentiated into adipocytes in vitro. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) used to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during preadipocyte differentiation up to day 8 revealed 15,918 known and 586 novel genes. We detected 21, 144, and 394 DEGs, respectively, including 16 genes differentially expressed at days , 4 and 8 compared to day 0. Th number of DEGs increased time-dependently. Lipid metabolism, cell differentiation and proliferation, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), wingless-type MMTV integration site (Wnt), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling, and steroid biosynthesis were significant at days , 4, and 8 compared to day 0 (adjusted  < 0.05). Short time-series expression miner (STEM) analysis obtained 26 clusters of differential gene expression patterns, and nine were significant ( < 0.05).

We assessed whether developmental exposure to this mixture in combination with a calorie-rich diet affected metabolic rate, blood lipids,  and lipid storage, and the whole-body level of neutral lipids in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Wildtype zebrafish were exposed to the mixture from 3 h post fertilization to 5, 14 or 17 days post fertilization (dpf) at water concentrations corresponding to 1, 10, 20, or 100 times the geometrical mean of the serum concentration (hsc) in the women. Exposure to the mixture at 20 times hsc lowered metabolic rate at -5 dpf, and increased the number of adipocytes and the amount of visceral adipose tissue at 14 and 17 dpf respectively. Also, mRNA expression of fatty acid binding protein 11a was increased at 17 dpf by 10 and 20 times hsc of the mixture. This study shows that a human-relevant mixture of environmental pollutants affects metabolic rate,  and lipid storage in young zebrafish fed a calorie-rich diet, thus demonstrating its potential to disrupt metabolism.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, a dose dependent study to evaluate liver injury was conducted in hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) deficient (ADH) and ADH normal (ADH) deer mice fed 1%, % or 3.5% EtOH in the liquid diet daily for  months. Blood alcohol concentration (BAC), liver injury marker (alanine amino transferase (ALT)), hepatic lipids and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) activity were measured. Liver histology, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling and cell death proteins were evaluated. Significantly increased BAC, plasma ALT, hepatic lipids and steatosis were found only in ADH deer mice fed 3.5% EtOH. Further, a significant ER stress and increased un-spliced X-box binding protein 1 were evident only in ADH deer mice fed 3.5% EtOH. Both strains fed 3.5% EtOH showed deactivation of AMPK, but increased acetyl Co-A carboxylase 1 and decreased carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A favoring  were found only in ADH deer mice fed 3.5% EtOH. Therefore, irrespective of CYP2E1 overexpression; EtOH dose and hepatic ADH deficiency contribute to EtOH-induced steatosis and liver injury, suggesting a linkage between ER stress, dysregulated hepatic lipid metabolism and AMPK signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474565>Glutamate Signaling in Hepatic Stellate Cells Drives Alcoholic Steatosis.</a></h2><p>Activation of hepatocyte cannabinoid receptor-1 (CBR) by hepatic stellate cell (HSC)-derived -arachidonoylglycerol (-AG) drives de novo  in alcoholic liver disease (ALD). How alcohol stimulates -AG production in HSCs is unknown. Here, we report that chronic alcohol consumption induced hepatic cysteine deficiency and subsequent glutathione depletion by impaired transsulfuration pathway. A compensatory increase in hepatic cystine-glutamate anti-porter xCT boosted extracellular glutamate levels coupled to cystine uptake both in mice and in patients with ALD. Alcohol also induced the selective expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor-5 (mGluR5) in HSCs where mGluR5 activation stimulated -AG production. Consistently, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of mGluR5 or xCT attenuated alcoholic steatosis in mice via the suppression of -AG production and subsequent CBR-mediated de novo . We conclude that a bidirectional signaling operates at a metabolic synapse between hepatocytes and HSCs through xCT-mediated glutamate-mGluR5 signaling to produce -AG, which induces CBR-mediated alcoholic steatosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Our previous study demonstrated that several novel peptides derived from Corylus heterophylla Fisch (C. heterophylla Fisch) have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. In this study, we purified and identified anti-obesity peptides from hazelnut protein hydrolysates by chromatography and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Subsequently, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of the synthetic peptide on  in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by Oil Red O staining, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot. The results showed that a novel synthetic pentapeptide, Arg-Leu-Leu-Pro-His (RLLPH), derived from the C3 fraction, attenuated  by downregulating the expression of several mRNAs related to , including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPα), adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein  (aP2), sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR). Moreover, RLLPH upregulated the levels of phosphorylated Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. A stability study revealed that RLLPH was relatively stable during pepsin digestion. These findings suggest that RLLPH has potential anti-obesity effects and may help combat metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Research into the detailed mechanism of adipocyte development is crucial for the treatment of excess fat. Zinc finger protein 217 plays roles in . However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that ZFP217 knockdown prevented the mitotic clonal expansion process and caused  inhibition. Depletion of ZFP217 increased the expression of the mA methyltransferase METTL3, which upregulated the mA level of cyclin D1 mRNA. METTL3 knockdown rescued the siZFP217-inhibited MCE and promoted CCND1 expression. YTH domain family  recognized and degraded the methylated CCND1 mRNA, leading to the downregulation of CCND1. Consequently, cell-cycle progression was blocked, and  was inhibited. YTHDF2 knockdown relieved siZFP217-inhibited adipocyte differentiation. These findings reveal that ZFP217 knockdown-induced  inhibition was caused by CCND1, which was mediated by METTL3 and YTHDF2 in an mA-dependent manner. We have provided novel insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms by which mA methylation is involved in the ZFP217 regulation of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618980> Extract Ameliorates High-Fat Diet-Induced Obesity in C57BL/6N Mice by Upregulating SIRT1.</a></h2><p> is widely used in Asia as a herbal medicine to treat type  diabetes, dyslipidemia, and inflammation. Here, we investigated the anti-obesity effect and underlying mechanism of  extract (GPE) enriched in gypenoside L, gypenoside LI, and ginsenoside Rg3 and obtained using a novel extraction method. Five-week-old male C57BL/6N mice were fed a control diet (CD), high-fat diet (HFD), HFD + 100 mg/kg body weight (BW)/day GPE (GPE 100), HFD + 300 mg/kg BW/day GPE (GPE 300), or HFD + 30 mg/kg BW/day Orlistat (Orlistat 30) for 8 weeks. The HFD-fed mice showed significant increases in body weight, fat mass, white adipose tissue, and adipocyte hypertrophy compared to the CD group; but GPE inhibited those increases. GPE reduced serum levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol, without affecting HDL-cholesterol. GPE significantly increased AMPK activation and suppressed  by decreasing the mRNA expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP1c), PPARγ coactivator-1α, fatty acid synthase (FAS), adipocyte protein  (AP2), and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and by increasing that of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT1) and hormone- sensitive lipase (HSL).

Bone marrow was aspirated from the proximal humerus and concentrated using an automated system (Angel System; Arthrex). Subacromial bursa was collected from  sites (over the RC tendon and muscle) and digested with collagenase to isolate a single cellular fraction. Proliferation, number of colony-forming units, differentiation potential, and gene expression were compared among the cells derived from each specimen.The cells derived from subacromial bursa showed significantly higher proliferation compared with the cells derived from cBMA after 5, 7, and 10 days (P = .018). Regarding colony-forming units, the subacromial bursa had significantly more colonies than cBMA (P = .002). Subacromial bursal cells over the RC tendon produced significantly more colonies than cells over both the RC muscle and cBMA (P = .033 and P = .028, respectively). Moreover, when compared with cBMA, cells derived from subacromial bursa showed significantly higher differentiation ability and higher gene expression indicative of chondrogenesis, osteogenesis, and .The subacromial bursa is an easily accessible tissue that can be obtained during RC repair, with significant pluripotent stem cell potency for tendon healing. Compared with cBMA taken from the proximal humerus, bursal cells showed significantly increased differentiation ability and gene expression over time.Failed RC repairs have been partly attributed to a poor healing environment. Biologic augmentation of the repair site may help increase healing potential and incorporation of the cuff at the tendon-bone interface.Copyright © 2019.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have multiple beneficial effects on obesity-associated disorders, and therefore may alleviate these alterations. This study aimed to determine the effects of body condition, fat depot, troglitazone, and different fatty acids on secretion of adiponectin, IL6 and TNFα from adipose tissue of healthy cats. Subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue samples were collected from 18 healthy intact female cats, and body condition score (Range 3-7/9) was determined. Concentrations of adiponectin were measured in mature adipocytes cultures and concentrations of IL6 and TNFα were measured in stromovascular cells cultures following treatment with control medium, troglitazone at 10 μM, eicosapentaenoic acid, arachidonic acid, or palmitic acid, at 25, 50, or 100 μM.Stromovascular cells of visceral origin secreted higher concentrations of IL6 than corresponding cells of subcutaneous origin (P = 0.003). Arachidonic acid treatment at 25, 50, and 100 μM increased IL6 secretion in subcutaneous (P = 0.045, P = 0.002, and P < 0.001, respectively) and visceral (P = 0.034, P = 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively) stromovascular cells. Eicosapentaenoic acid treatment increased TNFα secretion in subcutaneous stromovascular cells at 25, 50, and 100 μM (P = 0.002, P = 0.001, and P = 0.015, respectively) and in visceral stromovascular cells at 50 μM (P < 0.001). No significant effect on medium adiponectin concentration was observed following troglitazone treatment (P = 0.4) or fatty acids treatments at 25 (P = 0.), 50 (P = 0.8), or 100 (P = 0.7) μM. Body condition score did not have significant effects on medium concentrations of adiponectin (P = 0.4), IL6 (P = 0.1), or TNFα (P = 0.8).This study demonstrated higher basal secretion of IL6 from visceral compared to subcutaneous adipose tissue, a stimulatory effect of arachidonic acid on secretion of IL6 and a stimulatory effect of eicosapentaenoic acid on TNFα from feline adipose tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31235818>RepSox, a small molecule inhibitor of the TGFβ receptor, induces brown  and browning of white adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Unlike white adipose tissue (WAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT) is mainly responsible for energy expenditure via thermogenesis by uncoupling the respiratory chain. Promoting the differentiation of brown fat precursor cells and the browning of white fat have become a research hotspot for the treatment of obesity and associated metabolic diseases. Several secreted factors and a number of small molecules have been found to promote brown . Here we report that a single small-molecule compound, RepSox, is sufficient to induce  from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in fibroblast culture medium. RepSox is an inhibitor of the transforming growth factor-beta receptor I (TGF-β-RI), other inhibitors of TGF-β pathway such as SB431542, LY2157299, A83-01, and Tranilast are also effective in inducing  from MEFs. These adipocytes express brown adipocyte-specific transcription factors and thermogenesis genes, and contain a large number of mitochondria and have a high level of mitochondrial respiratory activity. More interestingly, RepSox has also been found to promote the differentiation of the brown fat precursor cells and induce browning of the white fat precursor cells. These findings suggest that inhibitors of TGF-β signaling pathway might be developed as new therapeutics for obesity and type  diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547031> Root Extract Inhibits  by Promoting Lipolysis in High Fat Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p> (AH) is widely consumed as a herbal medicine. It possesses biological activity against metabolic diseases. The objective of this study was to investigate effects of AH root water extract (AHR) on  in 3T3-L1 cells and in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. AHR inhibited lipid accumulation during adipocyte differentiation by downregulation of gene expression, such as hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and an adipogenic gene, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Oral administration of AHR significantly suppressed body weight gain, adipose tissue weight, serum leptin levels, and adipocyte cell size in HFD-induced obese mice. Moreover, AHR significantly decreased hepatic mRNA expression levels of cholesterol synthesis genes, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor (SREBP)-, and low-density lipoprotein receptor, as well as fatty acid synthesis genes, such as SREBP-1c and fatty acid synthase. Serum triglyceride levels were also lowered by AHR, likely as a result of the upregulating gene involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a, in the liver. AHR treatment activated gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, which might have promoted HSL and LPL-medicated lipolysis, thereby reducing white adipose tissue weight. In conclusion, AHR treatment can improve metabolic alterations induced by HFD in mice by modifying expression levels of genes involved in , , and lipolysis in the white adipose tissue and liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399502>S100A16-induced  is associated with up-regulation of 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1).</a></h2><p>The steadily increasing epidemic of obesity continues at alarming rates, is an important public health problem, and expression changes of S100A16 and 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1(11β-HSD1) is attributable to the adipocyte differentiation. In our previous study, we found that 11β-HSD1 protein expression increased in S100A16-overexpressed 3T3-L1 cell model. In order to further investigate the relationship between S100A16 and 11β-HSD1, and the molecular mechanisms of S100A16-induced , we constructed S100A16 transgenic and knockout mouse, and S100A16-overexpressed 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell.

Using the 3T3-L1 cell model, we examined the effect of S100A16 and 11β-HSD1 on pre-adipocyte differentiation, and cell signaling events of 11β-HSD1 overexpression induced by S100A16. We found that when compared with C57BL/6 mice, overexpression of S100A16 under the condition of HFD increased lipid content in WAT and fat infiltration in hepatocytes, 11β-HSD1 protein expression increased along with S100A16. Elevated S100A16 and 11β-HSD1 expression promoted  in 3T3-L1 cells. Overexpression of S100A16 inhibited the degradation of 11β-HSD1. We conclude that S100A16-induced  is associated with up-regulation of 11β-HSD1.© 2019 The Author(s).</p></html>
