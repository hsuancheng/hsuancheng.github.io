<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30052459>PEG-Peptide Inhibition of Scavenger Receptor Uptake of Nanoparticles by the Liver.</a></h1><p>PEGylated polylysine peptides represent a new class of scavenger receptor inhibitors that may find utility at inhibiting DNA nanoparticle uptake by Kupffer cells in the liver. PEG-peptides inhibit scavenger receptors in the liver by a novel mechanism involving in situ formation of albumin nanoparticles. The present study developed a new in vivo assay used to explore the structure-activity-relationships of PEG-peptides to find potent scavenger receptor inhibitors. Radio-iodinated PEG-peptides were dosed i.v. in mice and shown to saturate liver uptake in a dose-dependent fashion. The inhibition potency (IC) was dependent on both the length of a polylysine repeat and PEG molecular weight. PEG-Cys- was confirmed to be a high molecular weight (33.5 kDa) scavenger receptor inhibitor with an IC of 18 μM. Incorporation of multiple Leu residues improved potency, allowing a decrease in PEG MW and Lys repeat, resulting in PEG-Cys--(Leu-Lys)-Leu-Lys that inhibited scavenger receptors with an IC = 20 μM. A further decrease in PEG MW to 2 kDa increased potency further, resulting in a low molecular weight (4403 g/mol) PEG-peptide with an IC of 3 μM. Optimized low molecular weight PEG-peptides also demonstrated potency when inhibiting the uptake of radio-iodinated DNA nanoparticles by the liver. This study demonstrates an approach to discover low molecular weight PEG-peptides that serve as potent scavenger receptor inhibitors to block nanoparticle uptake by the liver.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30781926>Complete Covalent Structure of Human Platelet Factor 4.</a></h1><p>The amino acid sequence of the subunit of human platelet factor 4 has been determined. Human platelet factor 4 consists of identical subunits containing 70 amino acids, each with a molecular weight of 7,756. The molecule contains no methionine, phenylalanine or tryptophan. The proposed amino acid sequence of PF4 is: Glu-Ala-Glu-Glu-Asp-Gly-Asp-Leu-Gln-Cys-Leu-Cys-Val-Lys-Thr-Thr-Ser- Gln-Val-Arg-Pro-Arg-His-Ile-Thr-Ser-Leu-Glu-Val-Ile-Lys-Ala-Gly-Pro-His-Cys-Pro-Thr-Ala-Gin- Leu-Ile-Ala-Thr-Leu-Lys-Asn-Gly-Arg-Lys-Ile-Cys-Leu-Asp-Leu-Gln-Ala-Pro-Leu--Lys- Ile-Ile-Lys-Lys-Leu-Leu-Glu-Ser. From consideration of the homology with p-thromboglobulin, disulphide bonds between residues 10 and 36 and between residues 12 and 52 can be inferred.Schattauer GmbH Stuttgart.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959521>Meta-regression analysis to predict the influence of branched-chain and large neutral amino acids on growth performance of pigs1.</a></h1><p>A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), their interactions, and interactions with large neutral amino acids (LNAA) to develop prediction equations for growth performance of pigs. Data from 25 papers, published from 1995 to 2018, for a total of 44 trials and 210 observations were recorded in a database. Diets were reformulated using the NRC (2012) loading values to estimate nutrient concentrations. The response variables were average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain-to-feed ratio (G:F). The predictor variables tested included average body weight (BW), crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, Ile:Lys, Leu:Lys, Val:Lys, BCAA:Lys, Ile:Leu, Val:Leu, Ile:Val, (Ile+Val):Leu, Trp:Lys, Leu:Trp, Ile:Trp, Val:Trp, BCAA:Trp, Met:Lys, Leu:Met, Ile:Met, Val:Met, BCAA:Met, His:Lys, Leu:His, Ile:His, Val:His, BCAA:His, Thr:Lys, Leu:Thr, Ile:Thr, Val:Thr, BCAA:Thr, (Phe+):Lys, Leu:(Phe+), Ile:(Phe+), Val:(Phe+), BCAA:(Phe+), LNAA:Lys, Leu:LNAA, Ile:LNAA, Val:LNAA, and BCAA:LNAA. Amino acids were expressed on standardized ileal digestible basis. The MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used to develop the equations. The inverse of squared SEM was used to account for heterogeneous errors using the WEIGHT statement. Models were selected with a step-wise manual forward selection. In order to be included in the final model, predictor variables had to be statistically significant (P < 0.05) and provide an improvement of at least 2 points in Bayesian information criterion. The optimum equations were: ADG, g = - 985.94 + (15.2499 × average BW (kg)) - (0.08885 × average BW × average BW) + (1.063 × Leu:Lys) + (20.2659 × Ile:Lys) - (0.1479 × Ile:Lys × Ile:Lys) + (9.2243 × (Ile+Val):Leu) - (0.03321 × (Ile+Val):Leu × (Ile+Val):Leu) - (0.4413 × Ile:Trp); G:F, g/kg = 648.3 - (6.2974 × average BW (kg)) + (0.02051 × average BW × average BW) + (0.5396 × Ile:Lys) + (1.7284 × Val:Lys) - (0.00795 × Val:Lys × Val:Lys) - (1.7594 × Met:Lys); and ADFI, kg = predicted ADG/predicted G:F. Overall, the prediction equations suggest that increasing Leu:Lys negatively impacts ADG due to a reduction in G:F and ADFI caused by insufficient levels of other BCAA and LNAA relative to Leu. According to the model, the addition of Val, Ile, and Trp, alone or in combination, has the potential to counteract the negative effects of high dietary Leu concentrations on growth performance.© The Author(s) 2019.
