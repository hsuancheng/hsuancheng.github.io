<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28720829> is a PPARγ antagonist that improves glucose uptake, promotes osteogenesis and inhibits adipogenesis.</a></h2><p>PPAR antagonists are ligands that bind their receptor with high affinity without transactivation activity. Recently, they have been demonstrated to maintain insulin-sensitizing and antidiabetic properties, and they serve as an alternative treatment for metabolic diseases. In this work, an affinity-based bioassay was found to be effective for selecting PPAR ligands from the dried extract of an African plant (Diospyros bipindensis). Among the ligands, we identified  (BA), a compound already known for its anti-inflammatory, anti-tumour and antidiabetic properties, as a PPARγ and PPARα antagonist. Cell differentiation assays showed that BA inhibits adipogenesis and promotes osteogenesis; either down-regulates or does not affect the expression of a series of adipogenic markers; and up-regulates the expression of osteogenic markers. Moreover, BA increases basal glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The crystal structure of the complex of BA with PPARγ sheds light, at the molecular level, on the mechanism by which BA antagonizes PPARγ, and indicates a unique binding mode of this antagonist type. The results of this study show that the natural compound BA could be an interesting and safe candidate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and bone diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28208611>-Mediated Apoptosis in Human Prostate Cancer Cells Involves p53 and Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-κB) .</a></h2><p>Defects in p53 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling  are frequently observed in the initiation and development of various human malignancies, including prostate cancer. Clinical studies demonstrate higher expression of NF-κB/p65/RelA, NF-κB/p50/RelB, and cRel as well as downregulation of the p53 network in primary prostate cancer specimens and in metastatic tumors.  (BA), is a triterpenoid that has been reported to be an effective inducer of apoptosis through modification of several signaling . Our objective was to investigate the  involved in BA-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells. We employed the androgen-responsive LNCaP cells harboring wild-type p53, and androgen-refractory DU145 cells possessing mutated p53 with high constitutive NF-κB activity. Inhibition of cell survival by BA at 10 and 20 µM concentrations occurred as a result of alteration in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in both cell lines that led to an increased cytochrome C release, caspase activation and poly(ADP)ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, leading to apoptosis. BA treatment resulted in stabilization of p53 through increase in phosphorylation at Ser15 in LNCaP cells, but not in DU145 cells, and induction of cyclin kinase inhibitor p21/Waf1 in both cell types. Furthermore, treatment of both prostate cancer cells with BA decreased the phosphorylation of IκB kinase (IKK)α and I-kappa-B-alpha (IκBα) inhibiting the nuclear location of NF-κB/p65 causing cytosolic accumulation and resulting in its decreased nuclear binding. We demonstrate that BA may induce apoptosis by stabilizing p53 and downregulating NF-κB pathway in human prostate cancer cells, irrespective of the androgen association, and therefore can potentially be developed as a molecule of interest in cancer chemoprevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30178892>The protective effect of  on microvascular responsivity and protein expression in alzheimer disease induced by cerebral micro-injection of beta-amyloid and streptozotocin.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is mainly caused by accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) in vessels or parenchyma of the brain. Accordingly, natural compounds such as  (BA) might improve the AD signs by increase in blood flow and through reduction in amyloid plaques.Intra-hippocampal injection of BA (0.2 and 0.4 μmol/L /10 μL DMSO /rat) was done at intervals of 180 and 10 min before co-microinjection of 0.1 μmol/L Aβ dissolved in PBS (5 μL/rat, hippocampi) and 1.5 mg/kg Streptozotocin dissolved in aCSF (10 μL/rat, lateral ventricles). Cerebro-vascular responsivity tested by Laser Doppler, BBB leakage, Elisa assays of cytokines (TNF-α and IL-10), and Western blot analysis of proteins (BDNF and AchE) in the hippocampus were assessed 1 month after the injections.Microvascular reaction and BBB function were significantly impaired in AD rats, which were improved via BA pretreatment. BA could increase BDNF expression and decrease cytokine levels in the hippocampus of AD rats (especially 0.1 μmol/L Aβ: 0.4 μmol/L BA); however, no significant changes were detected in the blotting of AchE among the groups. could have a role in AD through protecting microcirculation, alleviating inflammation, and up-regulating BDNF expression which is clearer toward 1:4 molar ratios of Aβ to BA.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26772157>In vitro anticancer activity of  and derivatives thereof on equine melanoma cell lines from grey horses and in vivo safety assessment of the compound NVX-207 in two horses.</a></h2><p>, a pentacyclic triterpene, and its derivatives are promising compounds for cancer treatment in humans. Melanoma is not only a problem for humans but also for grey horses as they have a high potential of developing melanoma lesions coupled to the mutation causing their phenotype. Current chemotherapeutic treatment carries the risk of adverse health effects for the horse owner or the treating veterinarian by exposure to antineoplastic compounds. Most treatments have low prospects for systemic tumor regression. Thus, a new therapy is needed. In this in vitro study,  and its two derivatives B10 and NVX-207, both with an improved water solubility compared to , were tested on two equine melanoma cell lines (MelDuWi and MellJess/HoMelZh) and human melanoma (A375) cell line. We could demonstrate that all three compounds especially NVX-207 show high cytotoxicity on both equine melanoma cell lines. The treatment with these compounds lead to externalization of phosphatidylserines on the cell membrane (AnnexinV-staining), DNA-fragmentation (cell cycle analysis) and activation of initiator and effector caspases (Caspase assays). Our results indicate that the apoptosis is induced in the equine melanoma cells by all three compounds. Furthermore, we succeed in encapsulating the most active compound NVX-207 in 2-Hydroxyprolyl-β-cyclodextrine without a loss of its activity. This formulation can be used as a promising antitumor agent for treating grey horse melanoma. In a first tolerability evaluation in vivo the formulation was administered every one week for 19 consecutive weeks and well tolerated in two adult melanoma affected horses.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, its pharmacological activity related to an anti-inflammatory effect remain unknown. This present study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of methanol extracts of X. sibiricum roots (MXS), and to further determine its underlying mechanism of action in order to assess the medicinal value of X. sibiricum roots.To assess the anti-inflammatory activity of MXS in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages, the production of nitric oxide (NO) was measured using the Griess reagent system. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators were quantified using an Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Subsequently, immunoblotting analyses were employed to detect inflammatory mediators as well as to elucidate the underlying regulatory mechanisms suppressed by MXS.MXS inhibited LPS-stimulated NO production and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages within the non-cytotoxic concentration range (50-400 μg/ml). In addition, mRNA and protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were significantly suppressed by MXS at the concentration of 400 μg/ml. Furthermore, MXS (200 μg/ml) clearly reduced the phosphorylation levels of the inhibitor of kappa Bα (IκBα) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), without affecting changes in the phosphorylation levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). When five major components (betulin, , β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and scopoletin) of MXS were separately investigated, stigmasterol and β-sitosterol seemed to play major inhibitory roles in the LPS-induced production of inflammatory mediators such as NO, IL-6, and TNF-α.Our results demonstrate that MXS has an anti-inflammatory property in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages, and its anti-inflammatory activity is exerted by the regulation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and STAT3 signaling .Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

B.K. Cui, M.L. Han & Y.C. Dai has been used for medicinal purposes for over 5000 years. Numerous studies have confirmed the biological activity of compounds found in this species. The purpose of this study was a comparative analysis of selected groups of metabolites in the extracts from fruiting bodies and mycelial cultures. Phenolic acids (syringic, gallic, p-hydroxybenzoic, 3,4-dihydrophenylacetic), indole compounds (L-tryptophan, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, 5-methyltryptamine), sterols (ergosterol, ergosterol peroxide, hexestrol, cholecalciferol), and triterpenes (, betulin) were determined quantitatively by high performance liquid chromatography with UV-Vis/DAD detection, while fatty acids were assessed with the gas chromatography method. Cytotoxic activity against selected human cancer cell lines was determined using the lactate dehydrogenase test. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated on lipopolysaccharide activated A549 cells. Those extracts with anti-inflammatory activity were evaluated for their inhibition of pro-inflammatory enzymes. The mycelium extract exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against prostate cancer cells, while the fruiting body extract indicated a moderate effect on the viability of melanoma and prostate cancer. Incubation of lung epithelial cells with biomass extract significantly decreased cyclooxygenase-2 levels compared to LPS activated A549 cells. This paper is the first report of a comparative quantitative analysis of the metabolites in mycelial cultures and fruiting bodies. In addition, a novel element of this study is its comparison of the cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory activity of the obtained extracts. The results of comparing the composition and activity of mycelium and fruiting bodies shows that the cultures could be proposed as a potential biotechnological source for selected biologically active compounds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29784509>Lactoferrin-modified -loaded PLGA nanoparticles are strong anti-leishmanials.</a></h2><p>Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL), caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani, is a potentially fatal disease. The only orally bioavailable drug miltefosine is toxic and the effective liposomal Amphotericin B (AmBisome) is limited by its prohibitive cost and requirement for parenteral administration. Therefore, finding a new potential drug candidate and an alternative delivery system is imperative. We report that  (BA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid from Betula alba bark, was loaded onto uniformly spherical PLGA nanoparticles (BANPs; diameter 187.5 ± 5.60 nm) coated with Lactoferrin (Lf-BANPs). The amastigotes count in macrophages was more effectively reduced by Lf-BANP than BA and BANP. Lf-BANPs reduced the pro-parasitic, anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, but increased nitric oxide (NO), production in L. donovani-infected macrophages indicating that Lf-BANP possesses a significant anti-leishmanial activity.Copyright © 2018.

Px rats were provided with a high-fat diet containing 0.6% KME-E, 0.6% KME-W, and 0.6% dextrin (control) for 8 weeks. As normal-control, Sham-operated rats were provided with 0.6% dextrin. In cell-based studies, the effects of its main terpenoids (betulin, , and oleanolic acid) on glucose  were measured. Both KME-W and KME-E decreased epididymal fat mass by increasing fat oxidation in diabetic rats. KME-E but not KME-W exhibited greater potentiation of first-phase insulin secretion than the Px-control in a hyperglycemic clamp. KME-E also made β-cell mass greater than the control by increasing β-cell proliferation and decreasing its apoptosis. In a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, whole-body glucose infusion rate and hepatic glucose output increased with potentiating hepatic insulin signaling in the following order: Px-control, KME-W, KME-E, and normal-control. Betulin potentiated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake via increased PPAR-γ activity and insulin signaling in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, whereas oleanolic acid enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and cell proliferation in insulinoma cells. In conclusion, KME-E prevented the deterioration of glucose  in diabetic rats more effectively than KME-W and KME-E can be a better therapeutic agent for type 2 diabetes than KME-W.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28109788>Microbial hydroxylation and glycosylation of pentacyclic triterpenes as inhibitors on tissue factor procoagulant activity.</a></h2><p>To discover new inhibitors on tissue factor procoagulant activity, 20 pentacyclic triterpenes were semi-synthetized through microbial transformation and assayed on the model of human THP-1 cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide. In the biotransformation two types of reactions were observed, regio-selective hydroxylation and glycosylation. The bioassay results showed that most of tested compounds were significant effective on this model and two of the biotransformation products 23-hydroxy-28-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl  (3d) and 28-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl oleanic acid (1a) exhibited most potential activities with the IC values of 0.028, 0.035nM respectively. The preliminary structure and activity relationship analysis revealed that the aglycones with single free hydroxyl group on the skeleton (1, 1j) were less effective than that with more free hydroxyl groups (1d, 1f, 2), mono-glycosylation can significantly enhance their inhibitory effects.

On 6th day of treatment, UC was induced by transrectal instillation of 4% acetic acid (AA) and after 48 h colitis was assessed by measuring colitis parameters, biochemical estimations and histology of colon.APME or APAE pretreatment significantly (p < .05-.001) prevented AA-induced reduction in body weight and increase in colitis parameters viz. stool consistency, colon weight/length ratio and ulcer score, area and index. Extracts treatment attenuated (p < .001) increase in alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase in serum and myeloperoxidase activity and cytokines in colon tissue due to AA administration. Extracts treatment prevented AA-induced elevation in lipid peroxidation and decline in activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase and reduced-glutathione content (p < .05-.001) along with histopathological alterations. PRDS also showed similar ameliorative effect on colitis.APME and APAE showed a preventive effect on UC, and ameliorated inflammation and oxidative damage in colon.

BA bound with α-glucosidase to form a BA-α-glucosidase complex, resulting in a more compact structure of the enzyme. The obtained concentrations and spectra profiles of the components resolved by the multivariate-curve resolution-alternating least-squares confirmed the formation of the BA-α-glucosidase complex. Molecular docking showed that BA tightly bound to the active cavity of α-glucosidase, which might hinder the entrance of the substrate leading to a decline in enzyme activity.

The hemorrhoids were induced by applying 6% croton oil preparation in the ano-rectal region. Rats were orally administered methanolic and aqueous extract at doses of 250 and 500mg/kg, each for 7 days. Pilex (200mg/kg) was used as reference anti-hemorrhoidal drug. Hemorrhoids were assessed on eighth day by measuring hemorrhoidal and biochemical parameters along with histology of ano-rectal tissue.Croton oil application caused induction of hemorrhoids as indicated by significant (p<0.001) increase in plasma exudation of Evans blue in ano-rectal tissue, macroscopic severity score and ano-rectal coefficient as compared to normal rats. It significantly (p<0.001) elevated lactate dehydrogenase and cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) levels in serum and increased myeloperoxidase activity and lipid peroxidation in ano-rectal tissue along with marked histological damage as compared to normal rats. Treatment with tuber extracts and pilex significantly (p<0.05-p<0.001) ameliorated Evans blue exudation, hemorrhoidal parameters and other biochemical parameters with attenuation of tissue damage compared to hemorrhoid control rats. The results indicate that tuber extracts exhibited curative action on hemorrhoids. The aqueous extract showed more pronounced effect than methanolic extract. The effects may be attributed to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.Results indicate that tuber of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius exhibited curative action on hemorrhoids through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.

(BA) is a pentacyclic lupane triterpene with a potent antioxidant activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the ameliorative effect and underlying mechanisms of BA on Dex-induced oxidative damage. Mice were pretreated with BA orally (0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg) daily for 14 days, and then a single dose of Dex (25 mg/kg body weight) was administered intraperitoneally 8 h after the last administration of BA to induce oxidative stress. BA pretreatment significantly alleviated Dex-induced changes of blood biochemical indices, increased the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and the ability of inhibiting hydroxyl radical (AIHR), reduced the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in serum. Moreover, BA pretreatment enhanced the T-AOC, AIHR and the activity of peroxidase (POD) in liver, spleen and thymus. Concomitant with these biochemical parameters, BA pretreatment significantly reduced gene and protein expressions of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (P38 MAPK) in the lymphatic organs of Dex-treated mice. BA was found to effectively attenuate Dex-induced oxidative damage. These protective effects may be mediated in part through the JNK-P38 MAPK signaling transduction pathway and BA may be a potential therapeutic agent due to its anti-oxidative properties.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

NF-κB activators and inhibitors also significantly induced and reduced, respectively, cell proliferation/migration/invasion of AR-positive bladder cancer lines, but not AR-knockdown or AR-negative lines, and their growth in xenograft-bearing mice. In both nonneoplastic and neoplastic urothelial cells, NF-κB activators/inhibitors upregulated/downregulated, respectively, AR expression, whereas AR overexpression was associated with increases in the expression levels of NF-κB/p65 and phospho-NF-κB/p65. Thus, NF-κB appeared to be activated in bladder cancer, which was associated with tumor progression. NF-κB activators/inhibitors were also found to modulate tumorigenesis and tumor outgrowth in AR-activated urothelial cells. Accordingly, NF-κB inhibition, together with AR inactivation, has the potential of being an effective chemopreventive and/or therapeutic approach for urothelial carcinoma. .©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30125567> alleviates myocardial hypoxia/reoxygenation injury via inducing Nrf2/HO-1 and inhibiting p38 and JNK .</a></h2><p>Myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (I/RI) can lead to acute myocardial infarction (MI), which is a common cardiovascular disease (CVD) leading to morbidity and mortality worldwide.  exerts protective effect on myocardial I/RI in rats; however, the mechanism remains unknown.

The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of BA on calcium influx and static insulin secretion in pancreatic islets isolated from euglycemic rats. We found that BA triggers calcium influx by a mechanism dependent on ATP-dependent potassium channels and L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels. Additionally, the voltage-dependent and calcium-dependent chloride channels are also involved in the mechanism of BA, probably due to an indirect stimulation of calcium entry and increased intracellular calcium. Additionally, the downstream activation of PKC, which is necessary for the effect of BA on calcium influx, is involved in the full stimulatory response of the triterpene. BA stimulated the static secretion of insulin in pancreatic islets, indicating that the abrupt calcium influx may be a key step in its secretagogue effect. As such, BA stimulates insulin secretion through the activation of electrophysiological mechanisms, such as the closure of potassium channels and opening of calcium and chloride channels, inducing cellular depolarization associated with -biochemical effects, in turn activating PKC and ensuring the secretion of insulin.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

There is a dearth of information of its effect in testis. This study evaluated the protective role of  (BA) against NDMA-induced redox imbalance in testes of rats.Twenty-four male rats were assigned into four groups and treated with normal saline, BA, NDMA and [BA+NDMA]. BA (25 mg/kg) was given for 14 days, while NDMA (5 mg/kg) was given on days 7 and 12.Administration of NDMA significantly increased the weight and relative weight of testes by 51 and 71%, respectively, while treatment with BA attenuated the weight-gain. Furthermore, NDMA decreased the sperm count, motility and live-dead ratio by 57, 36 and 37%, respectively, and increased total sperm abnormality by 56%. However, BA attenuated the changes in the spermiogram of NDMA-treated rats. NDMA significantly decreased the activities of antioxidative enzymes, follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormones, while testicular levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and total cholesterol were increased. Also, NDMA increased the activities of aniline hydroxylase and aminopyrine-N-demethylase.

However, the poor solubility and low bioavailability limit its pharmaceutical effect. Herein, we reported the rapid efficient synthesis of the polyethylene glycol modified (PEGylated) BA liposomes using ethanol injection technique for the first time. In the study, hydrophobic BA was encapsulated in the lipid bilayer of liposomes, meanwhile hydrophilic PEG layer covered the surface of liposomes. The mean diameter of PEGylated BA liposomes was 142nm, which can effectively accumulate in the tumor tissues. In vitro drug release study showed that the PEGylated BA liposomes had a better sustained drug release effect than BA liposomes. The PEGylated BA liposomes also exhibited a better tumor inhibitory effect compared with those of free BA or BA liposomes in vitro and in vivo experiments. Therefore, the PEGylated BA liposomes could serve as a better alternative for the cancer therapy in future.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the mechanisms supporting this effect remain elusive. Recently, GPBAR1 (TGR5) a G-protein coupled receptor has been shown to mediate itching caused by intradermal administration of DCA and LCA. 6α-ethyl-3α, 7α-dihydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholan-23-ol (BAR502) is a non-bile acid dual ligand for FXR and GPBAR1.Cholestasis was induced in wild type and GPBAR1-/- mice by administration of α-naphthyl-isothiocyanate (ANIT) or 17α-ethynylestradiol.In naïve mice skin application of DCA, TLCA, 6-ECDCA, oleanolic and  induces a GPBAR1 dependent pruritogenic response that could be desensitized by re-challenging the mice with the same GPBAR1 agonist. In wild type and GPBAR1-/- mice cholestasis induced by ANIT fails to induce spontaneous itching and abrogates scratching behavior caused by intradermal administration of DCA. In this model, co-treatment with BAR502 increases survival, attenuates serum alkaline phosphatase levels and robustly modulates the liver expression of canonical FXR target genes including OSTα, BSEP, SHP and MDR1, without inducing pruritus. , a selective GPBAR1 ligand, failed to rescue wild type and GPBAR1-/- mice from ANIT cholestasis but did not induced itching.

We used a homology-based approach to identify and functionally characterize two new oxidosqualene cyclases (MdOSC4 and MdOSC5) and one cytochrome P450 (CYP716A175). The gene expression patterns of these enzymes and of previously described oxidosqualene cyclases were further studied in 20 apple cultivars with contrasting triterpene profiles. MdOSC4 encodes a multifunctional oxidosqualene cyclase producing an oleanane-type triterpene, putatively identified as germanicol, as well as β-amyrin and lupeol, in the proportion 82 : 14 : 4. MdOSC5 cyclizes 2,3-oxidosqualene into lupeol and β-amyrin at a ratio of 95 : 5. CYP716A175 catalyses the C-28 oxidation of α-amyrin, β-amyrin, lupeol and germanicol, producing ursolic acid, oleanolic acid, , and putatively morolic acid. The gene expression of MdOSC1 was linked to the concentrations of ursolic and oleanolic acid, whereas the expression of MdOSC5 was correlated with the concentrations of  and its caffeate derivatives. Two new multifuntional triterpene synthases as well as a multifunctional triterpene C-28 oxidase were identified in Malus × domestica.

In order to address these issues, herein, we developed  loaded polylactide-co-glycolide- monomethoxy polyethylene glycol nanoparticles (PLGA-mPEG NPs). The PLGA-mPEG co-polymer was synthesized and characterized using NMR and FT-IR. BA loaded PLGA-mPEG NPs were prepared by an emulsion solvent evaporation method. The developed nanoparticles had a desirable particle size (∼147nm) and exhibited uniform spherical shape under transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The PLGA-mPEG NPs were able to decrease the uptake by macrophages (i.e. J774A.1 and Raw 264.7 cells) as compared to PLGA nanoparticles. In vitro cytotoxicity in MCF7 and PANC-1 cells demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity of BA loaded PLGA-mPEG NPs as compared to free BA. The cellular uptake study in both the cell lines demonstrated time dependent uptake behavior. The enhanced cytotoxicity of BA NPs was also supported by increased cellular apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential loss, generation of high reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell cycle arrest. Further, intravenous pharmacokinetics study revealed that BA loaded PLGA-mPEG NPs could prolong the circulation of BA and remarkably enhance half-life by ∼7.21 folds. Consequently, in vivo studies in Ehrlich tumor (solid) model following intravenous administration demonstrated superior antitumor efficacy of BA NPs as compared to native BA. Moreover, BA NPs treated Ehrlich tumor mice demonstrated no biochemical, hematological and histological toxicities.

Here, we investigated the interactions of BA and its analogs with OATP1B1/3 and rat Oatp1b2 in vitro and in vivo. BA inhibited the activity of OATP1B1/3 and rat Oatp1b2 in vitro. Systemic exposure of atorvastatin was substantially altered with the intravenous co-administration of BA (20 mg/kg). Preincubation (incubation with inhibitors, followed by washout) with BA led to a sustained inhibition of OATP1B3, which recovered rapidly in the media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The addition of albumin to the media decreased intracellular concentrations of BA and expedited the recovery of OATP1B3 activity following preincubation. For asunaprevir and cyclosporin A (previously known to inhibit OATP1B3 upon preincubation), the addition of albumin to the media shortened recovery time with asunaprevir, but not with cyclosporin A. Overall, our results showed that BA inhibits OATP1B transporters in vitro and may incur hepatic transporter-mediated drug interactions in vivo. Our results identify BA as another OATP1B3 inhibitor with preincubation effect and suggest that the preincubation effect and its duration is impacted by altered equilibrium of inhibitors between intracellular and extracellular space (e.g., albumin in the media).Copyright © 2018 American Pharmacists Association®.

However, radioresistance remains a major impediment to radiotherapy. Although BetA () can induce radiosensitization, the underlying mechanism and whether it could induce radiosensitization in oral squamous cell carcinoma are not fully understood. In this study, we showed that BetA increased radiosensitization in CAL-27 and Tca-83 cells. Radiation-triggered Sp1 overexpression was responsible for radioresistance of OSCC (oral squamous cell carcinoma) cells. Treatment with BetA downregulated Sp1 and upregulated PTEN through inducing Sp1 sumoylation and correspondingly increased radiosensitization. Moreover, Sumoylation of Sp1 upregulated PTEN protein expression by downregulating Sp1 as well as inhibiting Sp1 DNA binding activity, thereby leading to the activation of PTEN transcription. Our results suggested that BetA was able to enhance radiosensitization at least partially by downregulating Sp1 and upregulating PTEN through inducing Sp1 sumoylation.

However, problems such as metronidazole-resistant T. vaginalis isolates and allergic reactions have been reported. Based on data previously published by our group, structural changes in  (1) were performed, generating three new compounds that were tested for in vitro anti-T.vaginalis activity in this study. Whereas derivative 2 did not demonstrate anti-T. vaginalis activity, derivatives 3 and 4 reduced trophozoite viability by 100%, with MIC values of 50μM. The structural difference of two compounds was performed only on the C-28 position. Derivative 3 showed low cytotoxicity against Vero cells in 24h; however, derivative 4 was highly cytotoxic, but efficient when associated with metronidazole in the synergism assay. ROS production by neutrophils was reduced, and derivative 3 showed anti-inflammatory effect.

Unfortunately both  and its  precursor, betulin, are very poorly soluble in aqueous buffers, thus their bioavailability and bio-distribution are insufficient in terms of medical applications.To investigate the specific anticancer role of the newly synthesized betulin derivatives in human epidermoid carcinoma cells.In the present study we synthesized five amino acid esters of betulin. For the synthesis we selected alanine (Boc-l-Ala-OH, negative control) and four basic amino acids - natural lysine (Boc-l-Lys(Boc)-OH) and three its unnatural derivatives (Boc-l-Dap(Boc)-OH, Boc-l-Dab(Boc)-OH, and Boc-l-Orn(Boc)-OH). Boc-protected amino acids were most convenient for the synthesis. All new esters have one (betulin-l-Ala-NH2) or two free amino groups which significantly increase their solubility in water and facilitate their transport through the cell membrane. It is worth noting that the biological activity of new esters of betulin is positive correlated with the length of the side chain of l-amino acid. The highest biological activity displayed compound containing lysine side chain (Lys, -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-NH2). Considering the biological activity, other derivatives can be set in the following series: Orn (-CH2-CH2-CH2-NH2)>Dab (-CH2-CH2-NH2)>Dap (-CH2-NH2)>Ala (CH3)>betulin. New betulin esters were tested in normal human keratinocytes (HaCaT) and human epidermoid carcinoma cells (A431). To assess cytotoxicity, MTT test was performed after 24, 48 and 72h of incubation with the test compounds at a concentration range of 0.75-100μM. In case of apoptotic activity, a TUNEL method and comet assay were performed. Additionally expression of caspase-3 and PARP1 was evaluated immunocytochemically.The highest cytotoxicity in cells induced skin cancer new compounds, particularly compound containing a lysine side chain (IC50=7μM) and ornithine (IC50=10μM). The highest number of apoptotic cells was observed in case incubation with compound containing Orn, Dab and Dap side chain.The new betulin ester derivatives display enhanced antitumor activity compared to their non-modified precursors.

B10 is a new glycosylated derivative of  with enhanced cytotoxic activity. The present study was designed to explore the molecular mechanism underlying the anticancer effect of B10 in glioma cells. 25-50μM B10 resulted in a significant decrease of cell viability and BrdU incorporation. 25-50mg/kg B10 significantly reduced the implanted tumor weight and volume in nude mice. Activation of apoptosis was found in glioma cells when the cells were exposed to B10, as evidenced by increased number of TUNEL-stained cells, increased caspase 3 and 9 activities, and Bax and cleaved PARP expression. B10 caused a significant decrease in mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate, mitochondrial complex I, II, III, IV, and V activities, and ATP level, and increase of mitochondrial ROS production, indicating the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction. B10 reduced the expression of sirtuin (SIRT) 1 and resulted in an increase in forkhead box O (FOXO) 3a expression and acetylation. Activation of SIRT1 by SRT-1720 and downregualtion of FOXO3a using shRNA significantly inhibited B10-induced cytotoxicity. B10 markedly increased the expression of Bim and PUMA. Downregualtion of FOXO3a or activation of SIRT1 significantly inhibited B10-induced increase of Bim and PUMA expression. Downregualtion of Bim or PUMA could suppress B10-induced increase of Bax expression. Moreover, B10-induced cytotoxicity was significantly suppressed by downregulation of Bim or PUMA.

Previous studies have indicated that TGF-β responsiveness is determined by TGF-β receptor partitioning between lipid raft/caveolae-mediated and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Lipid raft/caveolae-mediated endocytosis facilitates TGF-β degradation and thus suppressing TGF-β responsiveness.

Research is now geared towards investigating the inhibition of glycolysis for anticancer drug development.  (BA) has demonstrated potent anticancer activities in multiple malignancies. However, its regulatory effects on glycolysis and the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unclear. BA inhibited invasion and migration of highly aggressive breast cancer cells. Moreover, BA could suppress aerobic glycolysis of breast cancer cells presenting as a reduction of lactate production, quiescent energy phenotype transition, and downregulation of aerobic glycolysis-related proteins. In this study, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) was also identified as the molecular target of BA in inhibiting aerobic glycolysis. BA treatment led to GRP78 overexpression, and GRP78 knockdown abrogated the inhibitory effect of BA on glycolysis. Further studies demonstrated that overexpressed GRP78 activated the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor PERK. Subsequent phosphorylation of eIF2 led to the inhibition of -catenin expression, which resulted in the inhibition of c-Myc-mediated glycolysis. Coimmunoprecipitation assay revealed that BA interrupted the binding between GRP78 and PERK, thereby initiating the glycolysis inhibition cascade. Finally, the lung  model validated that BA inhibited breast cancer metastasis , as well as suppressed the expression of aerobic glycolysis-related proteins. In conclusion, our study not only provided a promising drug for aerobic glycolysis inhibition but also revealed that GRP78 is a novel molecular link between glycolytic metabolism and ER stress during tumor metastasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26750873> Increases eNOS Phosphorylation and NO Synthesis via the Calcium-Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p> (BA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpene that attenuates vascular diseases and atherosclerosis, but the mechanism by which it stimulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is unclear. eNOS is the key regulatory enzyme in the vascular endothelium. This study examined the intracellular  underlying the effects of BA on eNOS activity and endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production in endothelial cells. BA treatment induced both eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1177 and NO production. It also increased the level of intracellular Ca(2+) and phosphorylation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ). Inhibition of the L-type Ca(2+) channel (LTCC) and the ryanodine receptor (RyR) abolished BA-induced intracellular levels of Ca(2+) and eNOS phosphorylation. Treatment with W7 (a CaM antagonist), KN-93 (a selective inhibitor of CaMKII), and STO 609 (a selective inhibitor of CaMKK) suppressed eNOS phosphorylation and NO production. Moreover, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was induced by BA, and BA-induced eNOS phosphorylation was inhibited by compound C, an AMPK inhibitor. Taken together, these results indicate that BA activates eNOS phosphorylation and NO synthesis via the Ca(2+)/CaMKII and Ca(2+)/CaMKK/AMPK .

Several synthetic agents used in alleviation of NDMA toxicity have been associated with serious side effects. Therefore, a safe and less toxic agent is desirable. In this study,  (BA), a triterpenoid antioxidant, is proposed as a better and alternative agent to modulate NDMA-induced toxicity. Twenty-four Wistar rats were assigned into four groups of six rats each and treated with normal saline (control), BA (25 mg/kg), NDMA (5 mg/kg) and (BA + NDMA). BA was given by oral gavage for 14 consecutive days, while NDMA was administered intraperitoneally on days 7 and 12. Results showed that administration of NDMA significantly ( p < 0.05) elevated the activities of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase by 51%, 48% and 81%, respectively. Also, NDMA intoxication significantly ( p < 0.05) increased the levels of serum urea and creatinine by 64% and 82%, respectively, and decreased urinary creatinine by 67%. In addition, administration of NDMA significantly ( p < 0.05) increased the levels of hepatic and renal DNA fragmentation by 44% and 61%, respectively, relative to control. The number of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (mnPCEs) in NDMA-treated rats (11.1 ± 2.6 mnPCE/1000PCE) was significantly higher than control (4.3 ± 1.1 mnPCE/1000 PCE). Immunohistochemistry revealed strong expressions of Bcl-2 and nuclear p53 in NDMA-intoxicated rats. Interestingly, pretreatment with BA significantly ( p < 0.05) ameliorated NDMA-induced changes in serum biochemical indices, mnPCEs, DNA fragmentation and expressions of Bcl-2 and p53 proteins.

The risk of developing osteoporosis increases with aging, especially after menopause in women. Discovering the signaling pathways that play a significant role in aging- and menopause-induced osteoporosis should accelerate osteoporosis drug discovery. In this study, we found that bile acid membrane receptor Tgr5 knockout C57BL/6J mice had similar bone mass as wild-type mice during early and middle-age (before 4 months old) bone remodeling; however, Tgr5 markedly decreased bone mass in aged (more than 7 months old) and ovariectomized (OVX) mice compared with wild-type mice. Moreover, Tgr5 knockout strongly induced osteoclast differentiation but had no effect on osteoblast activity. Treatment with different TGR5 agonists consistently inhibited osteoclast differentiation. Importantly, our results showed that Tgr5 regulates osteoclastogenesis by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, which is a central metabolic pathway involved in the pathophysiology of aging and age-related diseases. The bile acid nuclear receptor FXR is an established regulator of bone metabolism. We screened the derivatives of  (BA), a known TGR5 agonist, to identify novel dual agonists of FXR and TGR5. The derivative SH-479, a pentacyclic triterpene acid, could activate both TGR5 and FXR, with a better inhibitory effect on osteoclastogenesis compared with agonists solely activating FXR or TGR5 and additionally enhanced osteoblastogenesis. Furthermore, SH-479 therapeutically abrogated bone loss in C57BL/6J mice through the bone remodeling pathways. Together, our results demonstrate that dual targeting the bile acid membrane receptor TGR5 and nuclear receptor FXR is a promising strategy for osteoporosis.© 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31244838>Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) and the Proteasome Attenuates IL-1β Expression in Primary Mouse Cardiac Fibroblasts.</a></h2><p> IL-1β is a highly potent pro-inflammatory cytokine and its secretion is tightly regulated. Inactive pro-IL-1β is transcribed in response to innate immune receptors activating NFκB. If tissue damage occurs, danger signals released from necrotic cells, such as ATP, can activate NLRP3-inflammasomes (multiprotein complexes consisting of NLRP3, ASC, and active caspase-1) which cleaves and activates pro-IL-1β. NLRP3 activation also depends on NEK7 and mitochondrial ROS-production. Thus, IL-1β secretion may be regulated at the level of each involved component. We have previously shown that NLRP3-dependent IL-1β release can be induced in cardiac fibroblasts by pro-inflammatory stimuli. However, anti-inflammatory mechanisms targeting IL-1β release in cardiac cells have not been investigated. mTOR is a key regulator of protein , including autophagy and proteasome activity. In this study we explored whether autophagy or proteasomal degradation are regulators of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β release from cardiac fibroblasts.  Serum starvation selectively reduced LPS/ATP-induced IL-1β secretion from cardiac fibroblasts. However, no other inflammasome components, nor mitochondrial mass, were affected. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin restored pro-IL-1β protein levels as well as LPS/ATP-induced IL-1β release from serum starved cells. However, neither serum starvation nor rapamycin induced autophagy in cardiac fibroblasts. Conversely, chloroquine and bafilomycin A (inhibitors of autophagy) and  (a proteasome activator) effectively reduced LPS-induced pro-IL-1β protein levels. Key findings were reinvestigated in human monocyte-derived macrophages.  In cardiac fibroblasts, mTOR inhibition selectively favors pro-IL-1β synthesis while proteasomal degradation and not autophagy is the major catabolic anti-inflammatory mechanism for degradation of this cytokine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28757534>Triterpenoids Isolated from Ziziphus jujuba Enhance Glucose Uptake Activity in Skeletal Muscle Cells.</a></h2><p>Jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.), a traditional folk medicine and functional food in China and South Korea, is known for its beneficial properties, which include anti-cancer, anti-oxidative, and anti-obesity effects.

(BA) is an active compound isolated from the bark of the birch tree Betula spp. (Betulaceae) and has been shown to attenuate hepatic fibrosis. However, the effect of BA on the high glucose‑induced fibrosis response in CFs remains to be elucidated, therefore, the present study investigated the effect of BA on high glucose‑induced CFs and examined the possible mechanism underlying the effect of BA on CF transdifferentiation. CFs were pre‑incubated with various concentrations of BA for 24 h and then stimulated with high glucose (25 mM) for various times. Cell proliferation was evaluated using an MTT assay. The mRNA expression levels of α‑smooth muscle actin (SMA) and transforming growth factor (TGF)‑β1 were determined using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. The protein expression levels of α‑SMA, collagen I, collagen III, fibronectin, TGF‑β1, small mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad)2/3, phosphorylated (p)‑Smad2 and p‑Smad3 and were detected using western blot analysis. The data revealed that BA attenuated the CF proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation induced by high glucose. In addition, BA inhibited the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the CFs induced by high glucose. It was also found that BA inhibited the high glucose‑induced phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in the CFs. Taken together, BA suppressed the high glucose‑induced increase in the proliferation of CFs and expression of ECM via inhibition of the TGF‑β1/Smad signaling pathway.

Thus, we aimed to prepare novel 50:50 poly(lactic--glycolic acid) (PLGA)-loaded B nanoparticles (BNP) and to compare its anti-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) activity with parent B.BNP were synthesized and characterized using different methods such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry and particle size analyses. Particle size of BNP was optimized through the application of the stabilizer, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The anti-HCC response was evaluated through in vitro cell line study using Hep-G2 cells, confocal microscopy, in vivo oral pharmacokinetics and animal studies. Further, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis was conducted to observe the changes in the expression of specific genes.Particle size of BNP was optimized through the application of the stabilizer, polyvinyl alcohol. Physicochemical characterization exhibited particle size of 257.1 nm with zeta potential -0.170 mV (optimized batch B, BNP). SEM and FTIR analyses of BNP showed that cylindrical particles of B converted to spherical particles in BNP and there were no interaction between B and used polymers. The release study of optimized BNP was highest (≥80%) than any other formulation. Later, in vitro cell culture analysis using Hep-G2 cells and confocal microscopy studies revealed that BNP had the highest inhibition and penetration properties than parent B. Oral pharmacokinetics studies using albino Wistar rats at single 100 mg dose again exhibited BNP had the higher 50% of plasma concentration (t), a higher maximum plasma concentration () and took longer to reach the maximum plasma concentration (T) than parent B. Next, our in vivo study using nitrosodiethyl amine (NDEA)-induced HCC model documented BNP decreased in number of nodules, restored body weight, oxidative stress parameters, liver marker enzymes and histological architecture than parent B. Lastly, qRT-PCR studies further demonstrated that anti-HCC properties of BNP may be due to over expression of antiapoptotic caspases i.e., caspase 3 and 8.The prepared BNP showed a better therapeutic response against HCC and could be attributed as future candidate molecule for HCC treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30027606>Phytochemical Profiles of Alpine Plant Horminum pyrenaicum L. during Phenological Growth Stages.</a></h2><p>Horminum pyrenaicum L. is a medicinal, aromatic and ornamental plant native to the Pyrenees and Alps.

However, the compound being highly lipophilic, has limited in vivo uptake capacity. BA derivatives with halogen substituent at C-2 have improved membrane permeability and cytotoxicity against cancer cells.The halogenated triterpenoid, 2α-bromo-dihydrobetulonic acid (B1) was synthesized from  (BA) isolated from Bischofia javanica. Aim of the study was to determine whether B1 could act as a more efficient inhibitor of Topo IIα activity and HeLa cell proliferation, in comparison to BA.B1 displayed efficient inhibition of DNA relaxation activity of topoisomerase IIα and the inhibitory effect was markedly improved upon pre-incubation of the compound with enzyme. Topoisomerase IIα inhibition by B1 was relieved in presence of increasing concentrations of DNA suggesting the compound as a reversible catalytic inhibitor. Subsequent UV and fluorescence spectroscopy studies indicated that B1 interacts and intercalates with DNA at concentrations signicantly greater than that required for topoisomerase IIα inhibition. The compound showed cytotoxic activity against HeLa cells with significantly lower IC value (7.5 μM) as compared to that of BA (30 μM) and had very low damaging/cytotoxic effect on normal cells. Treatment of B1 impaired HeLa cell proliferation by inducing Go-G1 arrest through lowered expression of cyclin D1 and PCNA polypeptides, and enhanced expression of p21.

It is related with genomic instability, which has been shown to occur in the presence of autophagy deficiency. Yet, the mechanism that triggers genomic instability and senescence from a condition of autophagy deficiency remains unknown. By analyzing the consequences of treating human keratinocytes (HaCaT) with the pentacyclic triterpenoid  (BA) we were able to propose that cell senescence can develop as a response to parallel damage in the membranes of mitochondria and lysosome.We performed biochemical, immunocytochemical and cytometric assays after challenging HaCaT cells with BA. We also evaluated membrane leakage induced by BA in liposomes and giant unilamellar vesicles.By destabilizing lipid bilayers of mitochondria and lysosomes, BA triggers the misbalance in the mitochondrial-lysosomal axis leading to perceived autophagy impairment, lipofuscinogenesis, genomic instability and cell senescence. The progressive accumulation of mitochondria and lipofuscin, which comes from imperfect mitophagy triggered by BA, provides a continuous source of reactive species further damaging lysosomes and leading to cell aging.This work reveals that the initial trigger of cell senescence can be the physical damage in the membranes of lysosomes and mitochondria.This concept will help in the search of new drugs that act as senescence-inductors. BA is under evaluation as chemotherapeutic agent against several types of tumors and induction of cell senescence should be considered as one of its main mechanisms of action.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, we hypothesized that  may protect against brain ischemic injury in the animal model of stroke. Focal cerebral ischemia was achieved by using the standard intraluminal occlusion method and reperfusion enabled after 2 h ischemia. Neurological deficits were scored. Infarct size was determined with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride monohydrate (TTC) staining and the mRNA expression of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) was determined by RT-PCR in infarct tissue. ROS generation and apoptosis in ischemic tissue were analyzed by measuring the oxidative conversion of cell permeable 2',7'-dichloro-fluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) to fluorescent dichlorofluorescein (DCF) in fluorescence microplate reader and TUNEL assay, respectively. In Kunming mice, 2 h of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion followed by 24 or 72 h of reperfusion led to an enhanced NOX4 expression in the ischemic hemisphere. This was associated with elevated levels of ROS generation and neuronal apoptosis. Pre-treatment with  (50 mg/kg/day for 7 days via gavage) prior to MCA occlusion prevented the ischemia/reperfusion-induced up-regulation of NOX4 and ROS production.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of BA on experimental MN in rats and explored the mechanisms by which it enhances antioxidant activities and resolves inflammatory condition in experimental MN. Passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by a single tail vein injection of anti- Fx1A antiserum. The rats were orally administered BA (25 and 50 mg kg  d ) or dexamethasone (DEX; 0.07 mg kg-1, reference compound) for 4 weeks after the induction of PHN. Blood, urine, and kidney tissue were collected for analysis at the end of the study. Treatment of PHN rats with BA or DEX significantly attenuated renal dysfunction, histopathological alterations and reduced immune complex deposition in the kidneys. Furthermore, BA ameliorated mRNA and protein expression of NF-κB, iNOS, TNF-α, Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO1 in the kidney. BA also restored malondialdehyde level and antioxidant enzyme activities in the kidney. In a nutshell, the protective effect of BA can be explained by its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities, which in turn is due to downregulation of NF-κB pathway and activation of Nrf2.

The concept of immunostimulatory activity of SA-BA is based on the activation of immune system against cancer antigen. This study showed that SA-BA, a pentacyclic triterpene isolated from the bark of the Ziziphus jujube tree, elevated the immunological functions of cancer antigen in anticancer immunotherapy. We found that, SA-BA pulsed human macrophages secreted elevated level of pro-inflammatory cytokines with an increased CD4(+) cell population. Pulse macrophages were also significantly arrested the KG-1A and K562 cell growth in vitro setup at 1:10 ratio for 48h. The use of TNF-α inhibitors confirmed the association between SA-BA with TNF-α function. SA-BA pulsed macrophages displayed substantial T cell allostimulatory capacity and promoted the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The adjuvanticity of SA-BA was proved by the generation of in vivo IgG response. Collectively, these findings will enrich the biomedical applications of SA-BA as a potent immune stimulating agent. Moreover, the macrophage stimulating efficacy of SA-BA might be an effective way in the cancer immunotherapy.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

It is found in different plant organs, both as a free aglycon and as glycosyl derivatives. A wide range of pharmacological activities has been described for this triterpenoid, including antiviral and antitumor effects. In addition, several other interesting properties have been identified in the fields of immunity and metabolism, namely antidiabetic, antihyperlipidemic, and anti-inflammatory activities. Taken together, these latter three properties make  a highly interesting prospect for treating metabolic syndrome.

However, the pathogenesis of NAFLD remains to be elucidated, and no established therapeutic regimens for treating NAFLD exist. Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the main cellular energy sensor, has been implicated as a key regulator of hepatic lipid and glucose . Recently, emerging evidence indicates that many plant-derived natural products are capable of ameliorating NAFLD by targeting AMPK.The published literature in PubMed relating to this topic was searched through June 2016.Significant advances have been made with respect to understanding the protective effects of plant-derived natural products against NAFLD. A variety of natural products, including alkaloids (berberine, demethyleneberberine, nicotine, caffeine, etc.), polyphenols (resveratrol, puerarin, curcumin, caffeic acid, etc.) and other compounds (β- caryophyllene, gastrodin, compound K, , etc.), have demonstrated promising results in preclinical studies. Mechanistic studies of these compounds have focused on their activation of AMPK and its downstream effectors involved in lipid .The findings of this review confirm that plant-derived natural products capable of activating the AMPK signaling pathway are potential therapeutic agents for NAFLD.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28435224>Investigation of triamterene as an inhibitor of the TGR5 receptor: identification in cells and animals.</a></h2><p>G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1, also known as TGR5) has been shown to participate in glucose homeostasis. In animal models, a TGR5 agonist increases incretin secretion to reduce hyperglycemia. Many agonists have been developed for clinical use. However, the effects of TGR5 blockade have not been studied extensively, with the exception of studies using TGR5 knockout mice. Therefore, we investigated the potential effect of triamterene on TGR5.We transfected the TGR5 gene into cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1 cells) to express TGR5. Then, we applied a fluorescent indicator to examine the glucose uptake of these transfected cells. In addition, NCI-H716 cells that secrete incretin were also evaluated. Fura-2, a fluorescence indicator, was applied to determine the changes in calcium concentrations. The levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) were estimated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Moreover, rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1-like diabetes were used to investigate the effects in vivo.Triamterene dose dependently inhibits the increase in glucose uptake induced by TGR5 agonists in CHO-K1 cells expressing the TGR5 gene. In cultured NCI-H716 cells, TGR5 activation also increases GLP-1 secretion by increasing calcium levels. Triamterene inhibits the increased calcium levels by TGR5 activation through competitive antagonism. Moreover, the GLP-1 secretion and increased cAMP levels induced by TGR5 activation are both dose dependently reduced by triamterene. However, treatment with KB-R7943 at a dose sufficient to block the Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) failed to modify the responses to TGR5 activation in NCI-H716 cells or CHO-K1 cells expressing TGR5. Therefore, the inhibitory effects of triamterene on TGR5 activation do not appear to be related to NCX inhibition. Blockade of TGR5 activation by triamterene was further characterized in vivo using the STZ-induced diabetic rats.Based on the obtained data, we identified triamterene as a reliable inhibitor of TGR5. Therefore, triamterene can be developed as a clinical inhibitor of TGR5 activation in future studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27864111>Secondary metabolites from Tetracera potatoria stem bark with anti-mycobacterial activity.</a></h2><p>Tetracera potatoria Afzel. Exg. Don (Dilleniaceae) is a medicinal plant used traditionally in Africa for the treatment of tuberculosis related ailments and respiratory infections. The antibacterial activity of the medium polar extracts of T. potatoria leaves and stem bark was recently reported against Mycobacterium smegmatis (MIC 25µg/mL) and M. aurum (65µg/mL), two fast-growing Mycobacterium strains used as model micro-organisms for the more pathogenic strain Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Fomogne-Fodjo et al., 2014). The aim of this study was consequently to isolate the compounds possibly contributing to this activity, and which may therefore be promising precursors to be used for the development of novel anti-TB drugs.T. potatoria medium polar extract [MeOH/DCM (1:1, v/v)] was fractionated sequentially with petroleum ether to which EtOAC and MeOH were gradually added to increase the polarity. The examination of T. potatoria extract and its fractions was guided by bioassays for anti-mycobacterial activity against M. smegmatis (ATCC 23246) and M. aurum (NCTC 10437) using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method. All the isolated compounds were structurally elucidated using spectroscopic techniques and evaluated for their anti-mycobacterial activity.Two novel secondary metabolites (1, 2) named tetraceranoate and N-hydroxy imidate-tetracerane, together with five known compounds [β-stigmasterol (3), stigmast-5-en-3β-yl acetate (4),  (5), betulin (6) and lupeol (7)] were isolated and identified. Tetraceranoate exhibited the best activity against M. smegmatis with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 7.8µg/mL, while β-stigmasterol,  and betulin showed appreciable anti-mycobacterial activity against both strains (MIC 15µg/mL).Seven compounds were isolated from the medium polar extract [MeOH/DCM (1:1, v/v)] of T. potatoria stem bark. Only tetraceranoate one of the isolated compounds showed antibacterial activity against M. smegmatis having efficacy as high as rifampicin (one of a three drug regimen recommended in the initial phase short-course anti-tuberculosis therapy). Thus, tetraceranoate might be an interesting target for systematic testing of anti-TB treatment and management. This research supports the use of T. potatoria in African traditional medicine for the treatment of tuberculosis related symptoms.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, not only malignant cells but also neighboring normal neurons and glial cells are damaged during PDT. In order to study the potential role of transcription factors-nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), activator protein (AP-1), and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3)-in photodynamic injury of normal neurons and glia, we photosensitized the isolated crayfish mechanoreceptor consisting of a single sensory neuron enveloped by glial cells. Application of different inhibitors and activators showed that transcription factors NF-κB (inhibitors caffeic acid phenethyl ester and parthenolide, activator ), AP-1 (inhibitor SR11302), and STAT-3 (inhibitors stattic and cucurbitacine) influenced PDT-induced death and survival of neurons and glial cells in different ways. These experiments indicated involvement of NF-κB in PDT-induced necrosis of neurons and apoptosis of glial cells. However, in glial cells, it played the antinecrotic role. AP-1 was not involved in PDT-induced necrosis of neurons and glia, but mediated glial apoptosis. STAT-3 was involved in PDT-induced apoptosis of glial cells and necrosis of neurons and glia. Therefore, signaling  that regulate cell death and survival in neurons and glial cells are different. Using various inhibitors or activators of transcription factors, one can differently influence the sensitivity and resistance of neurons and glial cells to PDT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27593449>Evaluation of seasonal changes of triterpenic acid contents in Viscum album from different host trees.</a></h2><p>Viscum album L. (Loranthaceae) is a semi-parasitic plant used in pharmacy and medicine mostly for its hypotensive and anticancer activity. The effects may be related to the presence of triterpenic acids, such as betulinic (BA) and oleanolic (OA) acids.In our investigations the content of triterpenic acids in V. album from different host trees depending on the season of harvest was determined.V. album herb was dried and extracted with ethyl acetate using ultrasound energy. The reversed phase HPLC-PDA method was used for the analysis of triterpenic acids. The structure of the target components was confirmed by mass spectrometry with an electrospray ionization source.Diversity in the content of both compounds was noted; however, OA was the dominant triterpenic acid and the amount thereof was ∼10 times higher than that of BA. The analysis of changes in the amount of triterpenic acids during the spring-winter period revealed the highest content of OA in summer (from 6.84 to 13.65 mg/g). In turn, in the other seasons of harvest, the content was in the range of 4.41-9.83, 6.41-9.56 and 5.59-12.16 mg/g for spring, autumn and winter, respectively. In most cases, a similar tendency was observed for BA.In most cases, the highest amount of the investigated compounds was found in summer; thus, this period seems to be optimal for acquisition of plant material rich in triterpenic acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26482309>Alkyl Amine Bevirimat Derivatives Are Potent and Broadly Active HIV-1 Maturation Inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Concomitant with the release of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particles from the infected cell, the viral protease cleaves the Gag polyprotein precursor at a number of sites to trigger virus maturation. We previously reported that a -derived compound, bevirimat (BVM), blocks HIV-1 maturation by disrupting a late step in protease-mediated Gag processing: the cleavage of the capsid-spacer peptide 1 (CA-SP1) intermediate to mature CA. BVM was shown in multiple clinical trials to be safe and effective in reducing viral loads in HIV-1-infected patients. However, naturally occurring polymorphisms in the SP1 region of Gag (e.g., SP1-V7A) led to a variable response in some BVM-treated patients. The reduced susceptibility of SP1-polymorphic HIV-1 to BVM resulted in the discontinuation of its clinical development. To overcome the loss of BVM activity induced by polymorphisms in SP1, we carried out an extensive medicinal chemistry campaign to develop novel maturation inhibitors. In this study, we focused on alkyl amine derivatives modified at the C-28 position of the BVM scaffold. We identified a set of derivatives that are markedly more potent than BVM against an HIV-1 clade B clone (NL4-3) and show robust antiviral activity against a variant of NL4-3 containing the V7A polymorphism in SP1. One of the most potent of these compounds also strongly inhibited a multiclade panel of primary HIV-1 isolates. These data demonstrate that C-28 alkyl amine derivatives of BVM can, to a large extent, overcome the loss of susceptibility imposed by polymorphisms in SP1.Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

Considering that BA is naturally produced in small quantities in plants, we previously reported the success in engineering its production in yeast. In the present study, we attempted to improve BA biosynthesis in yeast by the use of different strategies.We first isolated a gene encoding a lupeol C-28 oxidase (LO) from Betula platyphylla (designated as BPLO). BPLO showed a higher activity in BA biosynthesis compared to the previously reported LOs. In addition, two yeast platforms were compared for engineering the production of BA, which demonstrated that the WAT11 strain was better to host BA pathway than the CEN.PK strain. Based on the WAT11-chassiss, the Gal80p mutant was further constructed. The mutant produced 0.16 mg/L/OD600 of BA, which was 2.2 fold of that produced by the wild type strain (0.07 mg/L/OD600).This study reported our efforts to improve BA production in yeast employing multiple strategies, which included the identification of a novel LO enzyme with a higher activity in BA biosynthesis, the evaluation of two yeast strains for hosting the BA pathway, and the up-regulation of the expression of the BA pathway genes by managing yeast GAL gene regulon circuit.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30909900>In vitro evaluation of the α-glucosidase inhibitory potential of methanolic extracts of traditionally used antidiabetic plants.</a></h2><p>Different plant parts of Roylea cinerea (D.

(Cornaceae) are traditionally used in the management of diabetes and various other diseases.The air-dried plant parts from different plants were coarsely powdered and macerated in methanol to obtain their crude extracts. The crude extracts were evaluated for their α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. On the basis of results obtained, the methanolic crude extract of Cornus capitata Wall. was further sequentially fractionated in hexane, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, n-butanol. Fractions obtained were also evaluated for their α-glucosidase inhibitory potential. The kinetic study was performed using Lineweaver Burk plot to evaluate the type of inhibition. Furthermore, in silico analysis was also carried with active sites of the enzyme (PDB ID: 3WY1) using Autodock4.Among all the plant extracts, Cornus capitata extract showed maximum inhibitory activity. Therefore its methanolic extract was further fractionated with the help of different solvents and the maximum activity was shown by the ethyl acetate fraction (IC 50 μg/mL). Kinetic analysis indicated that Vmax and Km were increased indicating a competitive type of inhibition. In docking studies, among different constituents known in this plant,  showed minimum binding energy (- 10.21 kcal/mol). The kinetic and docking studies have strengthened the observation made in the present study regarding the α-glucosidase inhibitory activity of Cornus capitata.The study provided partial evidence for pharmacological basis regarding clinical applications of Cornus capitata in the treatment of diabetes suggesting it to be a suitable candidate for the treatment of postprandial hyperglycemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27707051>Factors influencing the fabrication of albumin-bound drug nanoparticles (ABDns): part I.

In this study, we applied ABDDS to a poorly water-soluble drug  (BA) to improve its aqueous solubility. Monomeric albumin-bound BA (ABBns) nanoparticles can be fabricated in the range of 10-20 nm. BA self-assembled with HSA at 0.1:1 to 2:1 molar ratio within 0.5 h in phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and 8.4. Approximately, 85-90% BA could be loaded onto HSA in the presence of Tween 20 (T20) and sodium cholate (NaC). The release of BA from ABBns was linear over 5 days. In conclusion, for poorly water-soluble acidic drugs, a suitable solubiliser can release the drug from HSA binding site, depending on the aggregation number and affinity of the solubiliser for the HSA binding site.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26523458>Adsorption between TC-stabilized AuNPs and the phosphate group: application of the PTP1B activity assay.</a></h2><p>Based on the adsorption between tetracycline (TC) and phosphate groups, a general colorimetric method is explored in this work by using TC-stabilized gold nanoparticles (TC/AuNPs) and 4-aminophenyl phosphate-functionalized Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (APP/MNPs). Taking protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) as an example, 4-aminophenyl phosphate (APP) can be hydrolyzed into 4-aminophenol (AP) by PTP1B, resulting in the disappearance of the phosphate group on the outer layer of MNPs and the loss of corresponding adsorptive ability. Upon addition of TC/AuNP solution, TC/AuNPs will remain in the supernatant solution after magnetic separation and a high absorbance value can be observed. So PTP1B activity is related to the concentrations of TC/AuNPs in the supernatant solution. In this work, the enzyme activity can be determined at levels as low as 0.0885 U mL(-1) and over a linear detection range as wide as 0.1 U mL(-1) to 0.9 U mL(-1). Moreover, using the proposed method, the inhibition effect of  (BA) and sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4) on PTP1B activity can be tested with IC50 values of 30 μM and 4 μM, respectively. Therefore, a universal platform for the accurate colorimetric analysis of kinase and phosphatase activities can be established through the adsorption between TC and phosphate groups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27618005>Anti-Inflammatory Effects and Mechanisms of Action of Coussaric and Betulinic Acids Isolated from Diospyros kaki in Lipopolysaccharide-Stimulated RAW 264.7 Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Diospyros kaki Thunb. is widely distributed in East Asian countries, its leaves being mainly used for making tea. In this study, coussaric acid (CA) and  (BA), both triterpenoid compounds, were obtained from D. kaki leaf extracts through bioassay-guided isolation. CA and BA showed anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, providing important information on their anti-inflammatory mechanism. Furthermore, they markedly inhibited nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages, and suppressed tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels. Furthermore, they decreased protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2. Pre-treatment with CA and BA inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB. We further examined the effects of CA and BA on heme oxygenase (HO)-1 expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages: BA induced HO-1 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner, while CA had no effect. We also investigated whether BA treatment induced nuclear translocation of Nrf2. BA inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB-binding activity, as well as pro-inflammatory mediator and cytokine production (e.g., NO, PGE₂, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6), by partial reversal of this effect by SnPP, an inhibitor of HO-1.

Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a key enzyme in lipid . Studies have shown that macrophage-derived LPL exhibits proatherogenic properties, and plays a major role in lipid accumulation in macrophages. Evidence suggests that oxidative stress can effectively enhance macrophage LPL production.  (BA) is a pentacyclic lupane triterpene with a potent antioxidant activity. In this study, we investigated whether BA affects the expression of macrophage LPL and how it regulates cellular lipid accumulation.We revealed that BA downregulated H2O2-simulated macrophage LPL protein, mRNA levels and its activity in both concentration- and time-dependent manners. Furthermore, BA decreased LPL-involved total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in macrophages. In addition, cellular lipid staining by Oil Red O showed that BA decreased cellular lipid droplet deposition. Next, we confirmed that pretreatment with BA decreased H2O2-induced production of intracellular reactive oxygen species in a concentration-dependent manner. Further studies demonstrated that BA inhibited H2O2-induced membrane translocation of PKC, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and c-Fos. Finally, the induction of LPL production and activity by H2O2 was abolished by BA, inhibition of PKC or ERK or depletion c-Fos, respectively.BA, through its role of antioxidant activity, attenuated macrophage-derived LPL expression and activity induced by oxidative stress, and effectively reduced cellular lipid accumulation, likely through inhibition of the  involving PKC, ERK and c-Fos.

Therefore, we transfected cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells with the TGR5 gene. The functions of the transfected cells were confirmed via glucose uptake using a fluorescent indicator. Moreover, NCI-H716 cells that secreted incretin were also investigated, and the glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) levels were quantified using ELISA kits. In addition, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1-like diabetic rats were used to identify the effect of ursolic acid in vivo. Ursolic acid concentration dependently increased glucose uptake in CHO-K1 cells expressing TGR5. In NCI-H716 cells, ursolic acid induced a concentration-dependent elevation in GLP-1 secretion, which was inhibited by triamterene at the effective concentrations to block TGR5. Ursolic acid also increased the plasma GLP-1 level via TGR5 activation, which was further characterized in vivo with type 1-like diabetic rats. Moreover, ursolic acid is more effective than  in reduction of hyperglycemia and increase of GLP-1 secretion. Therefore, we demonstrated that ursolic acid can activate TGR5, enhancing GLP-1 secretion in vitro and in vivo.

Pygopus2 (hPYGO2) encodes a chromatin remodelling protein important for breast cancer growth and cell cycle progression. The aims of this study were to determine the mechanism of expression of hPYGO2 in breast cancer and to examine how this expression is affected therapeutically.hPYGO2 and ER protein expression was examined in a breast tumour microarray by immunohistochemistry. hPYGO2 RNA and protein expression was examined in ER+ and ER- breast cancer cell lines in the presence of selective estrogen hormone receptor modulator drugs and the specificity protein-1 (SP1) inhibitor,  (BA). The effects of these drugs on the ability for ER and SP1 to bind the hPYGO2 promoter and affect cell cycle progression were studied using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays.hPYGO2 was expressed in seven of eight lines and in nuclei of 98% of 65 breast tumours, including 3 Ductal carcinoma in situ and 62 invasive specimens representing ER-negative (22%) and ER-positive (78%) cases. Treatment with either 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) or fulvestrant reduced hPYGO2 mRNA 10-fold and protein 5-10-fold within 4 h. Promoter analysis indicated an ER/SP1 binding site at nt -225 to -531 of hPYGO2. SP1 RNA interference and BA reduced hPYGO2 protein and RNA expression by fivefold in both ER- and ER+ cells. Further attenuation was achieved by combining BA and 4-OHT resulting in eightfold reduction in cell growth.Our findings reveal a mechanistic link between hormone signalling and the growth transcriptional programme. The activation of its expression by ERα and/or SP1 suggests hPYGO2 as a theranostic target for hormone therapy responsive and refractory breast cancer.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

FA-L-BA showed enhanced cytotoxicity (50% inhibitory concentration [IC] =63.07±2.22 μg/mL) compared to nontargeted control normal liposomes loaded with BA (L-BA; IC =93.14±2.19 μg/mL) in HepG2 cells in vitro. In addition, FA-functionalized liposomes loaded with Ir-1 (FA-L-Ir-1) showed significantly higher cellular uptake in HepG2 cells compared to nontargeted control normal liposomes loaded with Ir-1 (L-Ir-1). This novel approach for the liposomes surface modified with FA by a one-step enzymatic amidation was expected to provide potential application as a drug carrier for active targeted delivery to tumor cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28009869>The protective effect of  (BA) diabetic nephropathy on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>The present study was designed to investigate the protective effect of  (BA) on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. The rats were intraperitoneally injected with STZ (35 mg kg). 7 days later, the animals were intragastrically administered with metformin (MET, 150 mg kg), BA (20 mg kg) or BA (40 mg kg) once daily for consecutive 30 days. The blood glucose, the contents of insulin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in serum were examined. The levels of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in kidney tissues were measured. Moreover, the histopathological alteration and the protein expressions of the signaling pathway were detected by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and western blotting, respectively. BA significantly decreased the levels of serum insulin, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and blood glucose. In addition, BA increased the activities of SOD, CAT and reduced the contents of MDA, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in kidney tissues. BA also ameliorated the histopathological condition. Furthermore, BA attenuated the phosphorylations of p-adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB), and an inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBα) and the expressions of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase (HO)-1. These findings demonstrated that BA exhibited a protective effect on diabetic nephropathy in STZ-induced rats possibly through the AMPK/NF-κB/Nrf2 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29526565>Attenuation of quorum sensing controlled virulence factors and biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by pentacyclic triterpenes, betulin and .</a></h2><p>The production of virulence determinants and biofilm formation in numerous pathogens is regulated by the cell-density-dependent phenomenon, Quorum sensing (QS). The QS system in multidrug resistant opportunistic pathogen, P. aeruginosa constitutes of three main regulatory circuits namely Las, Rhl, and Pqs which are closely linked to its pathogenicity and establishment of chronic infections. In spite intensive antibiotic therapy, P. aeruginosa continue to be an important cause of nosocomial infections and also the major cause of mortality in Cystic Fibrosis patients with 80% of the adults suffering from chronic P. aeruginosa infection. Hence, targeting QS circuit offers an effective intervention to the ever increasing problem of drug resistant pathogens. In the present study, the pentacyclic triterpenes i.e. Betulin (BT) and  (BA) exhibited significant attenuation in production of QS-regulated virulence factors and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa, at the sub-lethal concentration. The test compound remarkably interfered in initial stages of biofilm development by decreasing the exopolysaccharide production and cell surface hydrophobicity. Based on the in vivo studies, the test compounds notably enhanced the survival of Caenorhabditis elegans infected with P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis revealed that BT and BA can act as a strong competitive inhibitor for QS receptors, LasR and RhlR. The findings suggest that BT and BA can serve as potential anti-infectives in the controlling chronic infection of P. aeruginosa.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

For realizing heterogenous production of lupane-type triterpenoids, our research firstly integrated all the seven genes in the MVA pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to increase the supply of squalene (triterpenoids universal precursor) in a single step using the DNA assembler method. Next, cell factories for production of lupeol was constructed by integrating Arabidopsis thaliana lupeol synthetic gene (AtLUP) into chromosome of triterpenoid chassis strain. Results showed that the MVA pathway, about 20 kb nucleotide length, could be assembled in one-pot process and the doubled MVA pathway could significantly improve squalene by 500-fold, reaching 354.00 mg•L⁻¹. NK2-LUP was obtained by introducing AtLUP gene on chromosome, and could produce 8.23 mg•L⁻¹ lupeol. This study supports the possibility of large-scale biosynthetic pathway assembly in S.cerevisiae and lays the foundation of obtaining cell factories for production of lupan-type triterpenoids at the same time.Copyright© by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29739589>Phenolic and triterpenoid composition and inhibition of α-amylase of pistachio kernels (Pistacia vera L.) as affected by rootstock and irrigation treatment.</a></h2><p>The current water scarcity forces farmers to adopt new irrigation strategies to save water without jeopardizing the fruit yield and quality. In this study, the influence of 3 regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) treatments and 3 rootstocks on the functional quality of pistachios were studied. The functional parameters studied included, polyphenols, triterpenoids, and inhibition of α-amylase. The results showed that P. terebinthus and P. atlantica rootstocks led to pistachio kernels with higher contents of polyphenols and triterpenoids (mainly  with 111 and 102 µg g, respectively) than pistachios obtained using P. integerrima rootstock (81 µg g). On the other hand, the use of moderate RDI (T1 treatment) increased the total content of polyphenols (∼10%), quercetin-O-galloyl-hexoside (∼15%), keampferol-3-O-glucoside (∼19%), and polymeric procyanidins (∼20%), as compared to the control trees, resulting in pistachios with a better functional profile, lower economic cost and with a lesser environmental impact.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, no study has been reported the cytotoxicity of this plant towards MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells. The present study was designed to investigate the mode of cell death and signalling  of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with dichloromethane Dillenia suffruticosa root extract (DCM-DS).Extraction of Dillenia suffruticosa root was performed by the use of sequential solvent procedure. The cytotoxicity of DCM-DS was determined by using MTT assay. The mode of cell death was evaluated by using an inverted light microscope and flow cytometry analysis using Annexin-V/PI. Cell cycle analysis and measurement of reactive oxygen species level were performed by using flow cytometry. The cells were treated with DCM-DS and antioxidants α-tocopherol or ascorbic acid to evaluate the involvement of ROS in the cytotoxicity of DCM-DS. Effect of DCM-DS on the expression of antioxidant, apoptotic, growth, survival genes and proteins were analysed by using GeXP-based multiplex system and Western blot, respectively. The cytotoxicity of compounds isolated from DCM-DS was evaluated towards MDA-MB-231 cells using MTT assay.DCM-DS induced apoptosis, G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and oxidative stress in MDA-MB-231 cells. The induction of apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells by DCM-DS is possibly due to the activation of pro-apoptotic JNK1 and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic ERK1, which in turn down-regulates anti-apoptotic BCL-2 to increase the BAX/BCL-2 ratio to initiate the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The cell cycle arrest in DCM-DS-treated MDA-MB-231 cells is possibly via p53-independent but p21-dependent pathway. A total of 3 triterpene compounds were isolated from DCM-DS.  appears to be the most major and most cytotoxic compound in DCM-DS.The data suggest the potential application of DCM-DS in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The objective of this study was to investigate the potential splenocytes protective effect and underlying mechanism of BA using dexamethasone (Dex)-induced mice as a model system. Pretreatment with BA (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg) dose-dependently ameliorated Dex-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis after 14 days of feeding. In addition to reactive oxygen species scavenging activity in Dex-induced splenocytes, BA administration up-regulated antioxidant enzymes, decreased lipid peroxidation, restored mitochondrial function, decreased the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, prevented the decline of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, inhibited caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation, and improved cell survival. These findings reveal that BA was able to mitigate Dex-induced oxidative stress and might play an important role in repairs of oxidative damage in immunological system.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

(BA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid. The present study was designed to explore the effects of BA on OSCC KB cell proliferation in vitro and on implanted tumor growth in vivo and to examine the possible molecular mechanisms. The results showed that BA dose-dependently inhibited KB cell proliferation and decreased implanted tumor volume. In addition, BA significantly promoted mitochondrial apoptosis, as reflected by an increase in TUNEL+ cells and the activities of caspases 3 and 9, an increase in Bax expression, and a decrease in Bcl-2 expression and the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate. BA significantly increased cell population in the G0/G1 phase and decreases the S phase cell number, indicating the occurrence of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. ROS generation was significantly increased by BA, and antioxidant NAC treatment markedly inhibited the effect of BA on apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and proliferation. BA dose-dependently increased p53 expression in KB cells and implanted tumors. p53 reporter gene activity and p53 binding in the promoters of Bax were significantly increased by BA. Knockdown of p53 blocked BA-induced increase in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of cell proliferation. NAC treatment suppressed BA-induced increase in p53 expression. Furthermore, phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was increased by BA. Taken together, the data demonstrated that ROS-p53 signaling was crucial for BA-exhibited antitumor effect in OSCC.

Previous drug design has focused on inhibitors targeting the active site of PTP1B. However, this has not been successful because the active site is positively charged and conserved among the protein tyrosine phosphatases. Therefore, it is important to develop PTP1B inhibitors with alternative inhibitory strategies. Using computational studies including molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and binding free energy calculations, we found that lupane triterpenes selectively inhibited PTP1B by targeting its more hydrophobic and less conserved allosteric site. These findings were verified using two enzymatic assays. Furthermore, the cell culture studies showed that lupeol and  inhibited the PTP1B activity stimulated by TNFα in neurons. Our study indicates that lupane triterpenes are selective PTP1B allosteric inhibitors with significant potential for treating those diseases with elevated PTP1B activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26391061> inhibits IL-1β-induced inflammation by activating PPAR-γ in human osteoarthritis chondrocytes.</a></h2><p> (BA), a triterpenoid isolated from birch bark, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we investigated the anti-osteoarthritic effects of BA in IL-1β-stimulated human osteoarthritis chondrocytes. Human osteoarthritis chondrocytes were pre-incubated with BA (6, 12, 24μM) for 12h and then treated with IL-1β (10ng/ml). The production of PGE2 and NO were detected by ELISA and Griess reagent. The expression of NF-κB, IκB, and PPAR-γ were detected by Western blotting. The results showed that BA dose-dependently inhibited IL-1β-induced MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, PGE2 and NO productions. BA also inhibited IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation. Furthermore, BA was found to activate PPAR-γ and the inhibition of PGE2 and NO by BA can be reversed by PPAR-γ antagonist GW9662.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of salinity stress on the expression of key genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of triterpenoids such as glycyrrhizin, , soyasaponins, and phytosterols in licorice root, as well as providing a phonemic platform to characterize antioxidant properties, glycyrrhizin, and total phenolic content. This study also includes measuring the gene expression level and glycyrrhizin content in leaves and roots of control plants. The studied genes included squalene synthase (SQS1 and SQS2), β-amyrin synthase (bAS), lupeol synthase (LUS), cycloartenol synthase (CAS), β-amyrin 11-oxidase (CYP88D6), and β-amyrin 24-hydroxylase (CYP93E6). Our results revealed that all of the mentioned genes were upregulated following the stress condition with different transcription rates. The highest increase (12-fold) was observed for the expression of the LUS gene, which is related to the  pathway. Also, the highest content of glycyrrhizin was observed at 72 h post-treatment, which was consistent with the upregulated transcription levels of the glycyrrhizin pathway genes especially SQS1 and CYP88D6 at the same time. Correlation and stepwise regression analysis proved the key role of SQS1 gene in the biosynthetic pathway of glycyrrhizin. Antioxidant activity and phenolic content also were increased following stress condition. A comparison between the expression levels of SQS1 and other genes involved in the production of glycyrrhizin, phytosterols, and soyasaponins revealed a similar transcription trend, which shows the gene expression in the roots was significantly higher than the leaves. In contrast, SQS2 and LUS genes displayed a higher expression in leaf tissues. The genes related to  biosynthetic pathway exhibited an expression rate different from other triterpenoid pathway genes, which could be observed in the leaves and roots of control plants and the roots of salt-treated plants. Furthermore, results showed that these two SQS genes have different expression rates due to different plant tissues (roots and leaves) and stress conditions. Importantly, in contrast to previous reports, we detected the glycyrrhizin in leaf tissues. This result may indicate the presence of a different genetic background in native Iranian licorice germplasm.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27236068>Lupane and 18α-oleanane derivatives substituted in the position 2, their cytotoxicity and influence on cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Lupane derivatives containing an electronegative substituent in the position 2 of the skeleton are often cytotoxic, however, the most active compounds are not selective enough. To further study the influence of a substituent in the position 2 in lupane and 18α-oleanane derivatives on their biological properties, we prepared a set of 38 triterpenoid compounds, 19 of them new, most of them substituted in the position 2. From betulin, we obtained 2-bromo dihydrobetulonic acid and 2-bromo allobetulon and their substitutions yielded derivatives with various substituents in the position 2 such as amines, amides, thiols, and thioethers. Nitration of allobetulon and dihydrobetulonic acid gave 2-nitro and 2,2-dinitro derivatives. Fifteen derivatives had IC50 < 50 μM on a chemosensitive CCRF-CEM (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) cell line and were tested on another seven cancer cell lines including resistant and two non-cancer lines. 2-Amino allobetulin had IC50 4.6 μM and caused significant block of the tumor cells in S and slightly in G2/M transition and caused strong inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis at 5 × IC50. 2-Amino allobetulin is the most active derivative of 18α-oleanane skeletal type prepared in our research group to date.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The present study demonstrates the potential effects of self assembled nano size  (SA-BA) by treating human leukemic cell lines (KG-1A and K562) and its normal counterpart. Self assembly property of BA was investigated using SEM and DLS study which showed that the BA forms fibrous structure having few nanometers in diameter. Selective anti-leukemic efficacy study of SA-BA was investigated by cell viability assay. Mode of leukemic cell death and probable pathway of apoptosis was monitored by measuring ROS level, pro and anti-inflammatory cytokine status and expression of caspase-8 and caspage-3 by immunocytochemistry. Higher efficacy of SA-BA over non-assemble BA was monitored toward cancer cells, with no relevant toxicity to normal blood cells. SA-BA facilitated reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated leukemic cell death, confirmed by pre-treatment of N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Induction of apoptosis by SA-BA treatment increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, specifically potentiated TNF-α mediated cell death, confirmed by expression of caspase-8 and caspage-3 by immunocytochemistry.

(BA), a pentacyclic triterpene, has been reported to have a variety of biological effects, including anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. This study was designed to determine whether BA could prevent atherosclerosis in diabetic apolipoprotein-E gene knockout (ApoE KO) mice. The mice were treated with BA for 12 weeks to examine its beneficial effects on atherosclerosis in ApoE KO mice. Male ApoE KO mice and age-matched control group mice (C57BL/6Jms) were used as experimental systems and their systolic blood pressure, insulin resistance, and vascular inflammation were measured. BA-treated ApoE KO mice showed lowered systolic blood pressure. The  parameter showed that BA decreased blood urea nitrogen, triglyceride, and total cholesterol levels. Blood glucose, insulin, glucose tolerance results, and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index were found to be better in BA-treated ApoE KO mice than untreated ApoE KO mice. Consistent with the change in lipid profiles, oil red O and H&E staining revealed that treatment with BA reduced atherosclerotic lesions such as roughened endothelial layers. BA ameliorated the reduction of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, leading to the inhibition of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and endothelin 1 (ET-1) expression. These results suggest that BA may be useful in the treatment and prevention of early atherosclerosis via the attenuation of endothelial dysfunction in diabetic ApoE KO mice.Copyright © 2017.

Expression of the neurosteroid/bile acid receptor Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) has been demonstrated in the brain and is thought to be neuroprotective. However, it is unknown how TGR5 signaling can influence the progression and associated neuroinflammation of HE. HE was induced in C57Bl/6 mice via intraperitoneal injection of azoxymethane (AOM) and tissue was collected throughout disease progression. TGR5 expression was elevated in the frontal cortex following AOM injection in mice. The cellular localization of TGR5 was found in both neurons and microglia in the cortex of C57Bl/6 mice. Central infusion of the TGR5 agonist, , prior to AOM injection delayed neurological decline, increased cortical cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentrations, reduced microglia activation and proliferation, and reduced proinflammatory cytokine production.  treatment in vitro reduced the neuronal expression of chemokine ligand 2, a chemokine previously demonstrated to contribute to HE pathogenesis. Lastly, treatment of the microglia cell line EOC-20 with conditioned media from -treated primary neurons decreased phagocytic activity and cytokine production. Together, these data identify that activation of TGR5, which is up-regulated during HE, alleviates neuroinflammation and improves outcomes of AOM-treated mice through neuron and microglia paracrine signaling.© 2015 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30347681>Sorafenib in Combination with  Synergistically Induces Cell Cycle Arrest and Inhibits Clonogenic Activity in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Cells.</a></h2><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most deadly cancers in the world due to late diagnosis and poor response to available treatments.

The combination of sorafenib with  inhibited the viability and proliferation of PDAC cells without the induction of apoptosis. The antiproliferative effect, caused by G2 cell cycle arrest, was strongly associated with increased expression of p21 and decreased expression of c-Myc and cyclin D1, and was induced only by combined treatment. Additionally, decreased proliferation could also be associated with the inhibition of the P13K/Akt and MAPK signaling .

Blocking angiogenesis to inhibit the growth and metastasis of solid tumors is currently one recognized therapy for cancer in the clinic. Firstly, based on a traditional  plaster, BA-12 was synthesized according to our previous study, as it exhibited better antitumor activities than other derivatives on human bladder carcinoma cells (T24); it was then uploaded for target prediction. Secondly, the efficacy and biotoxicity of BA-12 on angiogenesis were evaluated using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), a quail chick chorioallantoic membrane, and . According to the prediction results, the main mechanisms of BA-12 were metabolic pathways. Thus, multiple metabolomics approaches were applied to reveal the mechanisms of BA-12. Finally, the predictive mechanisms of BA-12 on glutathione metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism activation were validated using targeted metabolomics and pharmacological assays.

All the derivatives were evaluated for cytotoxic activity by MTT assay against five different human cancer cell lines: lung (A549), colon (HCT116), prostate (PC3), pancreatic (MIA PaCa-2) and breast (T47D). The data revealed that compounds 11c, 11d, 11g, 11h and 13a possess most promising cytotoxic potential. The compound 11h was one of the most active compounds, with IC values in the range of 4-6µM against all the five cancer cell lines. The results of this study suggested that derivatives with free -OH (11c, 11d and 11g) and free -COOH (11h and 13a) substitutions in the triazole moiety introduced at the C-28 position significantly improved the anti-tumor activity and may be the favourable position to synthesize potent anticancer leads from BA. Introduction of a non polar alkyl groups at C-28 position (10, 12 and 14) resulted in the significant loss of the activity. Further, DAPI staining, ROS generation and wound healing experiments revealed that compound 11h induces apoptosis in HCT-116 cells.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, a series of natural pentacyclic triterpenoids were collected and their inhibitory effects against CES1 and CES2 were assayed using D-luciferin methyl ester (DME) and N-(2-butyl-1,3-dioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[de] isoquinolin- 6-yl)- 2-chloroacetamide (NCEN) as specific optical substrate for CES1, and CES2, respectively. To this end,  (BA) was found with strong inhibitory effect on CES1 (IC, 15 nM) and relative high selectivity over CES2 (>2400-fold). Primary structure-activity relationships (SAR) analysis and docking simulations revealed that the carboxyl group at the C-28 site of BA is very essential for CES1 inhibition. The inhibition kinetic analyses demonstrated that BA was a potent competitive inhibitor against CES1-mediated DME hydrolysis. Further investigation on the inhibitory effect of BA in living cells (HepG2) based assays demonstrated that BA displayed potent inhibitory effects on intracellular CES1 activities, with the low IC value of 1.30 μM. These results demonstrated that BA is potent and highly selective CES1 inhibitor, which might be used as the promising tool for exploring the biological functions of CES1 in complex biological systems.Copyright © 2019.

Enzalutamide is an approved drug that inhibits AR activity and increases overall survival. However, resistance to enzalutamide develops rapidly often by increasing AR activity, suggesting that new therapies are required for CRPC. We investigated whether  (BA), a small molecule from plants that inhibits multiple deubiquitinases (DUBs), reduces AR, and selectively kills PCa cells, can provide an adjuvant strategy for CRPC. Our data indicated that BA reduced AR protein stability and mRNA expression, making it an attractive agent for CRPC. BA decreased AR mRNA possibly by inhibiting a histone 2A DUB thereby increasing ubiquitinated histone 2A, a transcriptional repressor. We identified multiple and specific DUBs inhibited by BA either in PCa cells or using recombinant DUBs. Similar results were obtained using another multi-DUB inhibitor WP1130, suggesting that these DUB inhibitors can decrease AR expression and increase PCa-specific death. Our results also suggest that combining multi-DUB inhibitors BA or WP1130 with enzalutamide may provide a novel strategy for CRPC by further decreasing AR expression and increasing apoptotic cell death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27188281> synergically enhances BMP2-induced bone formation via stimulating Smad 1/5/8 and p38 .</a></h2><p>Healing of bone defects is a dynamic and orchestrated process that relies on multiple growth factors and cell types. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) is a key growth factor for bone healing, which stimulates mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into osteoblasts.  (BetA) is a natural pentacyclic triterpenoid from plants. This study aimed to examine combinatory effects of BetA and BMP2 on ectopic bone generation in mice.In MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast culture, 10-15 μM of BetA increased the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and expression levels of osteogenic marker genes without the decreased cell viability. In addition, BetA synergistically enhanced BMP2-induced gene expressions and mineralization with the enhancement of phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and p38. In an in vivo ectopic bone formation model, combination of BetA (50 μg) and BMP2 (3 μg) resulted in increases in the amount of new bone generation, compared with treatment with BMP2 alone. Histological studies showed that bone generation with cortical and trabecular structures was resulted from the combination of BetA and BMP2.BetA can enhance in vivo osteogenic potentials of BMP2, possibly via stimulating Smad 1/5/8 and p38 , and combination of both agents can be considered as a therapeutic strategy for bone diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26460147> and oleanolic acid, natural pentacyclic triterpenoids, interfere with N-linked glycan modifications to intercellular adhesion molecule-1, but not its intracellular transport to the cell surface.</a></h2><p> (3β-hydroxy-20(29)-lupen-28-oic acid), oleanolic acid (3β-hydroxy-olean-12-en-28-oic acid), and ursolic acid (3β-hydroxy-urs-12-en-28-oic acid) are close structural isomers of natural pentacyclic triterpenoid carboxylic acids. We recently identified a unique biological effect of ursolic acid, its inhibition of the intracellular trafficking of glycoproteins. In the present study, we demonstrated that  and oleanolic acid did not inhibit the interleukin-1α-induced expression of cell-surface intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in human lung carcinoma A549 cells. Nevertheless,  and, to a lesser extent, oleanolic acid interfered with N-linked glycan modifications to ICAM-1 in a similar manner to castanospermine (an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum α-glucosidases I and II), but not swainsonine (an inhibitor of Golgi α-mannosidase II). Consistent with these results,  and oleanolic acid inhibited yeast α-glucosidase activity, but not Jack bean α-mannosidase activity.

The present study was focused on deciphering the detailed molecular mechanism of BA-induced apoptosis. In the present study, results indicated that BA was highly effective against HeLa cells via induction of time-dependent apoptosis, and the authors demonstrated that the BA treatment acted through downregulating a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) subunit and suppressing the Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473 after increasing the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Then, BA induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, which was consistent with the cell cycle-related protein results in which BA significantly enhanced the expression of p27Kip and p21Waf1/Cip1 in HeLa cells. This target-specific inhibition was associated with mitochondrial apoptosis, as reflected by the increased expression of Bad and caspase-9, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the decline in mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, preincubation of the cells with glutathione (antioxidant) blocked the process of apoptosis, prevented the phosphorylation of downstream substrates. These results established that ROS acted as a key factor to effect apoptosis by BA treatment in HeLa cells. Therefore, these findings demonstrated that BA induced apoptosis in HeLa cells by downregulating the expression of PI3K/Akt signaling molecules via ROS, and triggering a mitochondrial pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30467864>Effect of an anxiolytic botanical containing Souroubea sympetala and Platanus occidentalis on in-vitro diazepam human cytochrome P450-mediated .</a></h2><p>A novel anxiolytic natural health product (NHP) containing Souroubea sympetala and Platanus occidentalis is available for the companion animal market and is currently being developed for clinical evaluation.

It mediates human visual cycle and nourishes photoreceptors. Hypoxia-induced oxidative stress to RPE is a vital cause of retinal degeneration such as the Age-related Macular Degeneration. Most of these retinal diseases are irreversible with no efficient treatment, therefore protecting RPE cells from hypoxia stress is an important way to prevent or slow down the progression of retinal degeneration.  (BA) and betulin (BE) are pentacyclic triterpenoids with anti-oxidative property, but little is known about their effect on RPE cells. We investigated the protective effect of BA, BE and their derivatives against cobalt chloride-induced hypoxia stress in RPE cells. Human ARPE-19 cells were exposed to BA, BE and their eighteen derivatives (named as H3H20) that we customized through replacing moieties at C3 and C28 positions. We found that cobalt chloride reduced cell viability, increased Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production as well as induced apoptosis and necrosis in ARPE-19 cells. Interestingly, the pretreatment of 3-O-acetyl-glycyl- 28-O-glycyl- effectively protected cells from acute hypoxia stress induced by cobalt chloride. Our immunoblotting results suggested that this derivative attenuated the cobalt chloride-induced activation of Akt, Erk and JNK . All findings were further validated in human primary RPE cells. In summary, this BA derivate has protective effect against the acute hypoxic stress in human RPE cells and may be developed into a candidate agent effective in the prevention of prevalent retinal diseases.Copyright © 2018.

Members of the poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARP) familyare involved in both DNA repair and apoptosis, playing important roles in spermatogenesis. Poly-ADP-ribose polymerase can be cleaved by caspases, and the presence of its cleavage product (cPARP) in spermatozoa has been related to chromatin remodelling during spermatogenesis and to the activation of apoptotic . There are no reports on immunodetection of cPARP in ram spermatozoa; thus, we have tested a commercially available antibody for this purpose. cPARP was microscopically detected in the acrosomal ridge of some spermatozoa (indirect immunofluorescence). A preliminary study was carried out by flow cytometry (direct immunofluorescence, FITC). Ram semen was extended in TALP and incubated for 4 h with apoptosis inducers staurosporine (10 μm) or  (200 μm). Both inducers and incubation caused a significant increase in cPARP spermatozoa (0 h, control: 21.4±3.3%, inducers: 44.3±1.4%; 4 h, control: 44.3±2.4%, inducers: 53.3±1.4%). In a second experiment, we compared the sperm fractions after density gradient separation (pellet and interface). The pellet yielded a slightly lower proportion of cPARP spermatozoa (28.5±1.2% vs 36.2±2.0% in the interface; p < 0.001), and a 12-h incubation increased cPARP similarly in both fractions (p < 0.001). cPARP seems to be an early marker of apoptosis in ram semen, although its presence in untreated samples was weakly related to worse quality (pellet/interface). We suggest to study the relationship of PARP and cPARP levels with between-male differences on sperm fertility.© 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30253391>Attenuation of Remifentanil-Induced Hyperalgesia by  Associates with Inhibiting Oxidative Stress and Inflammation in Spinal Dorsal Horn.</a></h2><p>Remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia (RIH) is known to be associated with oxidative stress and inflammation.  (BA) was reported to reduce visceral pain owing to its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory potential. Here, we -explored whether BA can attenuate RIH through inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation in spinal dorsal horn. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: Control, Incision, RIH, and RIH pre-treated with BA. After pretreated with BA (25 mg/kg, i.g.) for 7 days, rats were subcutaneously infused with remifentanil (40 μg/kg) for 30 min during right plantar incision surgery to induce RIH. The paw withdrawal mechanical threshold (PWMT), paw withdrawal thermal latency (PWTL), spinal oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators were determined. Intraoperative remifentanil infusion induced postoperative hyperalgesia, as evidenced by the significant decrease in PWMT and PWTL (p < 0.01), and the significant increase in oxidative stress and inflammation evidenced by up-regulations of malondialdehyde, 3-nitrotyrosine, interleukin-1β and tumour necrosis factor-α (p < 0.01) in spinal dorsal horn and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity (p < 0.01) in dorsal root ganglion, as well as a decrease in manganese superoxide -dismutase activity (p < 0.01) compared with control and -incision groups. All these results mentioned above were markedly reversed by pre-treatment with BA (p < 0.01) compared with RIH group. These findings demonstrated that BA can effectively attenuate RIH, which associates with potentially inhibiting oxidative stress and subsequently down-regulating MMP-9-related pro-inflammatory cyokines in spinal dorsal horn.© 2018 S.

However, the natural abundance of these triterpenoids is low, and their chemical synthesis is costly. Transcription factors have the ability to regulate the metabolite pathways of triterpenoids via multi-gene control, thereby improving metabolite yield. Thus, transcription factors have the potential to facilitate the production of birch triterpenoids. Plant bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) transcription factors play important roles in stress response and secondary metabolism.In this study, we cloned two genes, BpMYC4 and BpbHLH9, that encode bHLH transcription factors in Betula platyphylla Suk. The open reading frame (ORF) of BpMYC4 was 1452 bp and encoded 483 amino acids, while the ORF of BpbHLH9 was 1140 bp and encoded 379 amino acids. The proteins of BpMYC4 and BpbHLH9 were localized in the cell membrane and nucleus. The tissue-specific expression patterns revealed that BpMYC4 expression in leaves was similar to that in the stem and higher than in the roots. The expression of BpbHLH9 was higher in the leaves than in the root and stem. The expressions of BpMYC4 and BpbHLH9 increased after treatment with abscisic acid, methyl jasmonate, and gibberellin and decreased after treatment with ethephon. The promoters of BpMYC4 and BpbHLH9 were isolated using a genome walking approach, and 900-bp and 1064-bp promoter sequences were obtained for BpMYC4 and BpbHLH9, respectively. The ORF of BpbHLH9 was ligated into yeast expression plasmid pYES3 and introduced into INVScl and INVScl1-pYES2-SS yeast strains. The squalene and total triterpenoid contents in the different INVScl1 transformants decreased in the following order INVScl1-pYES-SS-bHLH9 > INVScl1-pYES3-bHLH9 > INVScl1-pYES2- BpSS > INVScl-pYES2. In BpbHLH9 transgenic birch, the relative expression of the genes that encodes for enzymes critical for triterpenoid synthesis showed a different level of up-regulation compair with wild birch(control), and the contents of , oleanolic acid and betulin in bHLH9-8 transgenic birch were increased by 11.35%, 88.34% and 23.02% compared to in wild birch, respectively.Our results showed that the modulation of BpbHLH9 by different hormones affected triterpenoid synthesis and triterpenoid contents.

They also inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production but had no effect on the other inflammatory factors studied. More interestingly, a new anti-inflammatory betulin derivative 9 with a wide-spectrum anti-inflammatory activity was discovered. Compound 9 was found to suppress the expression of cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), as well as that of prostaglandin synthase-2 (COX-2) in addition to iNOS. The in vivo anti-inflammatory effect of compound 9 was indicated via significant suppression of the carrageenan-induced paw inflammation in mice. The results show, for the first time, that the pyrazole-fused betulin derivative (9) and related compounds have anti-inflammatory properties that could be utilized in drug development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26362468>Cell death mechanisms of plant-derived anticancer drugs: beyond apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Despite remarkable progress in the discovery and development of novel cancer therapeutics, cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the world. For many years, compounds derived from plants have been at the forefront as an important source of anticancer therapies and have played a vital role in the prevention and treatment of cancer because of their availability, and relatively low toxicity when compared with chemotherapy. More than 3000 plant species have been reported to treat cancer and about thirty plant-derived compounds have been isolated so far and have been tested in cancer clinical trials. The mechanisms of action of plant-derived anticancer drugs are numerous and most of them induce apoptotic cell death that may be intrinsic or extrinsic, and caspase and/or p53-dependent or independent mechanisms. Alternative modes of cell death by plant-derived anticancer drugs are emerging and include mainly autophagy, necrosis-like programmed cell death, mitotic catastrophe, and senescence leading to cell death. Considering that the non-apoptotic cell death mechanisms of plant-derived anticancer drugs are less reviewed than the apoptotic ones, this paper attempts to focus on such alternative cell death  for some representative anticancer plant natural compounds in clinical development. In particular, emphasis will be on some promising polyphenolics such as resveratrol, curcumin, and genistein; alkaloids namely berberine, noscapine, and colchicine; terpenoids such as parthenolide, triptolide, and ; and the organosulfur compound sulforaphane. The understanding of non-apoptotic cell death mechanisms induced by these drugs would provide insights into the possibility of exploiting novel molecular  and targets of plant-derived compounds for future cancer therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28213701>Ursolic acid-mediated changes in glycolytic pathway promote cytotoxic autophagy and apoptosis in phenotypically different breast cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Plant-derived pentacyclic triterpenotids with multiple biological activities are considered as promising candidates for cancer therapy and prevention. However, their mechanisms of action are not fully understood. In the present study, we have analyzed the effects of low dose treatment (5-20 µM) of ursolic acid (UA) and  (BA) on breast cancer cells of different receptor status, namely MCF-7 (ER, PR, HER2), MDA-MB-231 (ER, PR, HER2) and SK-BR-3 (ER, PR, HER2). UA-mediated response was more potent than BA-mediated response. Triterpenotids (5-10 µM) caused G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, an increase in p21 levels and SA-beta-galactosidase staining that was accompanied by oxidative stress and DNA damage. UA (20 µM) also diminished AKT signaling that affected glycolysis as judged by decreased levels of HK2, PKM2, ATP and lactate. UA-induced energy stress activated AMPK that resulted in cytotoxic autophagy and apoptosis. UA-mediated elevation in nitric oxide levels and ATM activation may also account for AMPK activation-mediated cytotoxic response. Moreover, UA-promoted apoptosis was associated with decreased pERK1/2 signals and the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential. Taken together, we have shown for the first time that UA at low micromolar range may promote its anticancer action by targeting glycolysis in phenotypically distinct breast cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31398872>Water Stress, Irrigation and Concentrations of Pentacyclic Triterpenes and Phenols in  L. cv. Picual Olive Trees.</a></h2><p>Pentacyclic triterpenes and phenols are two types of bioactive molecules found in olive trees that have important activities related to health and disease prevention. Triterpenes, including oleanolic acid, maslinic acid, erythrodiol and uvaol, show antitumoral activities, and phenols such as oleuropein, tyrosol, and hydroxytyrosol are natural antioxidants. The concentration of these metabolites is considered a marker of the quality of olives and olive oil. In recent years, a lack of rain water has caused important economic losses relating to olive trees grown in Jaén, Spain. In this work, we investigated the effect of water stress by drought on the concentration of pentacyclic triterpenes and phenols in the fruits, leaves, stems and roots of cv. Picual olive trees, by comparing the concentration found in water-stressed versus irrigated plants. We used HPLC-UV/Vis and HPLC-MS to identify and determine the concentration of each individual compound. Our results showed that important changes in the concentration of these compounds are produced in response to water stress in different organs. The total content of most of these compounds in the fruits was significantly reduced, affecting their quality and production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27454709>Spatio-Temporal Variation of Terpenoids in Wild Plants of Pentalinon andrieuxii.</a></h2><p>Pentalinon andrieuxii (Müll.Arg.)

A simple, specific, precise and accurate GC method with flame ionization detector (FID) developed and validated for the determination of oleanolic acid (OA) in human serum (HS). To an aliquot of HS, internal standard was added and a combination of liquid-liquid extraction with a mixture of diethyl ether-isopropyl alcohol, filtration and consecutive GC resulted in separation and quantification of OA. The organic phase was analyzed using a GC system equipped with a 30 × 0.25 mm i.d. Rtx-65TG capillary column and FID detection. Total chromatographic time was 10 min and no interfering peaks from endogenous components in blank serum were observed. The OA/internal standard peak area ratio was linearly fitted to the OA concentration (r = 0.992) over the range 10-1500 ng/mL. The mean serum extraction recovery of OA was 96.7 ± 1.0% and the lower limit of quantification based on 5 mL of serum was 10.7 ng/mL. The intra-day coefficient of variation ranged from 1.3 to 3.6% and inter-day varied from 1.4 to 4.5%. The developed method was used to study the pharmacokinetics of OA after oral administration in humans. The assay was simple, sensitive, precise and accurate for the use in the study of the mechanisms of absorption and distribution of OA in humans.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26537839>Preparation of Conjugates of Cytotoxic Lupane Triterpenes with Biotin.</a></h2><p>To better understand the mechanism of action of antitumor triterpenes, we are developing methods to identify their molecular targets.

In this work we determined the inhibitory ability of these compounds on the enzymatic, hemorrhagic, myotoxic and edema-inducing activities of Batx-I, a P-I metalloproteinase isolated from Bothrops atrox venom. BA, UA and OA inhibited the proteolytic activity of Batx-I on gelatin with IC values of 115.3, 223.0 and 357.3 μM, respectively. Additionally, these compounds showed inhibition of the hemorrhagic activity of Batx-I in skin with IC 345.7, 643.5 and 1077.0 μM for BA, UA and OA in preincubation experiments. In studies with independent-injection, in which Batx-I was injected and then, at the same site, a concentration of 600 μM of each compound were administered at either 0, 5 or 10 min, BA showed a significant reduction of hemorrhage at 0 and 5 min. In addition, these compounds inhibited myotoxicity and edema-forming activity of Batx-I at 600 μM concentration. Molecular docking studies suggested that these compounds could occupy part of the substrate binding cleft of the enzyme affecting its catalytic cycle.

It is therefore of high importance to find methods to reduce cadmium accumulation in the human body. Herein, we report that administration of  (BA) protects mice from cadmium chloride (CdCl2)-induced toxicity by inhibiting cadmium-induced apoptosis in both kidney and liver. Mice were given oral doses of 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg of BA daily for ten consecutive days, and were injected with one dose of 1 mg/kg CdCl2 after one hour of BA administration every day. The levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were assessed by ELISA. Residual cadmium was determined by atomic absorption analysis. Protein expression was evaluated by western blotting. Pretreatment with BA significantly reduced residual cadmium levels in the liver, kidney and testis, increased the cadmium output in urine, and reduced tissue damage induced by CdCl2. Moreover, BA prevented body weight loss by CdCl2 in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, BA treatment increased the expression levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), decreased Bcl-2-associated X (Bax), and inhibited the levels of active caspase-3. Importantly, BA within a dose of 30 mg/kg did not induce any signs of toxicity, and protected mice from the toxicity induced by CdCl2 in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that BA inhibits CdCl2 induced apoptosis in the kidney and liver, and BA may be an effective agent for the prevention and treatment of cadmium-induced diseases in humans.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

(BA), an antioxidant prepared from the white birch, exhibits immunomodulation properties. To assess the implications and investigate the mechanisms of BA-elicited immunomodulation, we hypothesized that Dex induced thymocyte apoptosis via oxidative stress could be lessened by BA.Mice were given oral doses of BA (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0mg/kg) daily for 14 days, and induced oxidative stress by giving a single dose of Dex intraperitoneal at the dosage of 25mg/kg body weight 8h after the last administration of BA.Dex administration alone significantly decreased antioxidant enzyme activities, while significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunctions, caspase-3 activation and cellular apoptosis. However, pretreatment with BA dose-dependently mitigated Dex-induced oxidative damage after 14 days of feeding. In addition to ROS scavenging activity in Dex-induced thymocyte, BA administration decreased lipid peroxidation, up-regulated antioxidant enzymes, restored mitochondrial function, increased Bcl-2 expression but reduced Bax expression, inhibited caspase-3 activation, and improved cell survival.These findings reveal a protective capability of BA against Dex-induced cell death by reducing oxidative stress via mitochondrial mediated signal pathway which could be the potential mechanism underlying BA-elicited immunomodulation.Copyright © 2015 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

Cell viability of betulin-, - and ursolic acid-treated bacteria decrease in time dependent manner. Treatment of bacteria in the presence of 2,2'-bipyrydyl increased cell viability. Superoxide anion radical production increased significantly (p < 0.05) in bacterial cells-treated with betulin,  and ursolic acid. Furthermore, NAD/NADH ratio increased significantly (p < 0.05) in betulin-, - and ursolic acid-treated bacteria. Similarly, level of reduced glutathione in E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus decreased significantly with corresponding increase in glutathione disulphide, malondialdehyde and fragmented DNA following betulin,  and ursolic acid treatments.

The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of BA on tumor growth in mice and HCC cell proliferation in vitro. We found that BA dose-dependently inhibited tumor growth in mice induced by DEN plus CCl4 (D/C) and suppressed cell viability and proliferation in several HCC cell lines. In addition, BA increased mitochondrial ROS generation and mitochondrial dysfunction, activating molecular apoptotic events and leading to apoptotic cell death. p53 was increased by BA in D/C-treated mice and HCC cells and inhibition of p53 significantly suppressed the pro-apoptotic and anti-tumor effect of BA. Increase of p66(shc) was involved in the pro-apoptotic and anti-tumor effect of BA. Moreover, BA-induced increase of p66(shc) was dependent upon p53. Sod2 expression was reduced by BA treatment, and a Sod2 mimic (MnTBAP) significantly blocked the pro-apoptotic and anti-tumor effect of BA. Furthermore, miR-21 was increased by BA in D/C-treated mice and HCC cells and inhibition of miR-21 significantly suppressed the pro-apoptotic effect of BA. miR-21 inhibitor attenuated BA-induced decrease of Sod2 and p53 inhibitor blocked BA-induced increase of miR-21. These results demonstrated that p53 is responsible for the anti-tumor effect of BA through up-regulation of p66(shc) and miR-21 and down-regulation of Sod2 expression, leading to mitochondrial ROS accumulation and apoptosis.

However, it is still controversial whether this apoptotic signaling is a relic of an abortive apoptosis related to spermatogenesis or if it should be regarded as a functional preformed pathway in mature sperm leading to stereotypical morphological changes reflecting nuclear disassembly. To address this question, apoptosis was induced using  in mature and immature ejaculated human sperm enriched by density gradient centrifugation. Execution of apoptosis was monitored by observing ultra-morphological changes via transmission electron microscopy. Typical morphological signs of apoptosis in somatic cells include plasma membrane blebbing with the formation of apoptotic bodies, impaired mitochondrial integrity, defects of the nuclear envelope, and nuclear fragmentation; these morphologies have also been observed in human sperm. In addition, these apoptotic characteristics were more frequent in immature sperm compared to mature sperm. Following  treatment, apoptosis-related morphological changes were induced in mature sperm from healthy donors. This effect was much less pronounced in immature sperm. Moreover, in both fractions, the  treatment increased the percentage of acrosome-reacted sperm. The results of our ultra-morphological study prove the functional competence of apoptosis in mature ejaculated human sperm. The theory of a sole abortive process may be valid only for immature sperm.

This plant accumulates triterpenoids; however, compared to Medicago truncatula and Glycine max, less information regarding its composition, content, and biosynthesis is available. In this study, we analyzed the triterpenoid content and composition of L. japonicus. L. japonicus accumulated C-28-oxidized triterpenoids (ursolic, betulinic, and oleanolic acids) and soyasapogenols (soyasapogenol B, A, and E) in a tissue-dependent manner. We identified an oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) and two cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) involved in triterpenoid biosynthesis using a yeast heterologous expression system. OSC9 was the first enzyme derived from L. japonicus that showed α-amyrin (a precursor of ursolic acid)-producing activity. CYP716A51 showed triterpenoid C-28 oxidation activity. LjCYP93E1 converted β-amyrin into 24-hydroxy-β-amyrin, a metabolic intermediate of soyasapogenols. The involvement of the identified genes in triterpenoid biosynthesis in L. japonicus plants was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis. Furthermore, gene loss-of-function analysis of CYP716A51 and LjCYP93E1 was conducted. The cyp716a51-mutant L. japonicus hairy roots generated by genome-editing technique produced no C-28 oxidized triterpenoids. Likewise, complete abolition of soyasapogenols and soyasaponin I was observed in mutant plants harboring Lotus retrotransposon 1 (LORE1) in LjCYP93E1. These results indicate that the activities of these P450 enzymes are essential for triterpenoid biosynthesis in L. japonicus. This study increases our understanding of triterpenoid biosynthesis in leguminous plants and provides information that will facilitate further studies of the physiological functions of triterpenoids using L. japonicus.© The Author(s) 2019.

Br. Here we investigated the in vitro anticancer properties of BrA. We report that BrA inhibits acyl-coA: cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT) activity in rat liver microsomes in a concentration-dependent manner, blocking the biosynthesis of the cholesterol fatty acid ester tumour promoter. We next demonstrated that BrA inhibits ACAT in intact cancer cells with an IC of 12.6 ± 2.4 µM. BrA inhibited both clonogenicity and invasiveness of several cancer cell lines, establishing that BrA displays specific anticancer properties. BrA appears to be more potent than the other pentacyclic triterpenes,  and ursolic acid studied under similar conditions. The inhibitory effect of BrA was reversed by exogenous addition of cholesteryl oleate, showing that ACAT inhibition is responsible for the anticancer effect of BrA. This report reveals new anticancer properties for BrA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29391000>Computational investigations of physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, toxicological properties and molecular docking of , a constituent of Corypha taliera (Roxb.) with Phospholipase A2 (PLA2).</a></h2><p> (BA) is a natural triterpenoid compound and exhibits a wide range of biological and medicinal properties including anti-inflammatory activity. Therefore, this theoretical investigation is performed to evaluate (a) physicochemical properties such as acid dissociation constant (pKa), distribution coefficient (logD), partition coefficient (logP), aqueous solubility (logS), solvation free energy, dipole moment, polarizability, hyperpolarizability and different reactivity descriptors, (b) pharmacokinetic properties like human intestinal absorption (HIA), cellular permeability, skin permeability (P), plasma protein binding (PPB), penetration of the blood brain  (BBB), (c) toxicological properties including mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, risk of inhibition of hERG gene and (d) molecular mechanism of anti-inflammatory action which will aid the development of analytical method and the synthesis of BA derivatives.The physicochemical properties were calculated using MarvinSketch 15.6.29 and Gaussian 09 software package. The pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties were calculated on online server PreADMET. Further, the molecular docking study was conducted on AutoDock vina in PyRx 0.8.The aqueous solubility increased with increasing pH due to the ionization of BA leading to decrease in distribution coefficient. The solvation energies in water, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), acetonitrile, n-octanol, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride were - 41.74 kJ/mol, - 53.80 kJ/mol, - 66.27 kJ/mol, - 69.64 kJ/mol, - 65.96 kJ/mol and - 60.13 kJ/mol, respectively. From the results of polarizability and softness, it was clear that BA is less stable and hence, kinetically more reactive in water. BA demonstrated good human intestinal absorption (HIA) and moderate cellular permeability. Further, BA also exhibited positive CNS activity due to high permeability through BBB. The toxicological study revealed that BA was a mutagenic compound but noncarcinogenic in mice model. Moreover, molecular docking study of BA with PLA2 revealed that BA interacts with GLY22 & GLY29 through hydrogen bond formation and LEU2, PHE5, HIS6, ALA17, ALA18, HIS47 and TYR51 through different types of hydrophobic interactions. The binding affinity of BA was - 41.00 kJ/mol which is comparable to the binding affinity of potent inhibitor 6-Phenyl-4(R)-(7-Phenyl-heptanoylamino)-hexanoic acid (BR4) (- 33.89 kJ/mol).Our computed properties may assist the development of analytical method to assay BA or to develop BA derivatives with better pharmacokinetic and toxicological profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29279966> alleviates dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis and visceral pain in mice.</a></h2><p> (BA) exhibits many biological effects including anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. Free radicals and pro-inflammatory mediators play an important role in the pathology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and associated pain. We, therefore, examined the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-nociceptive potential of BA in colitis. Colitis was induced with 3% (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water in mice for 1to7 days. BA (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg) was given orally for 0 to 7 days. BA was also tested for its efficacy in acetic acid and mustard oil-induced visceral nociception in mice at same doses. BA significantly prevented diarrhea; bleeding and colonic pathological changes induced by DSS. Further, BA reduced the colon nitrite, malondialdehyde, myeloperoxidase, and lipid hydroperoxide levels and restored the superoxide dismutase, catalase and reduced glutathione levels to normalize the redox balance in DSS-exposed mice. Inflammatory mediators like matrix metalloproteinase-9 and prostaglandin E2 levels were also significantly attenuated by BA in colitis mice. Additionally, BA reduced acetic acid and mustard oil-induced visceral pain in mice. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that BA possesses good anti-nociceptive activity and the anti-IBD effects of BA are due to its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory potential.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28065760>Establishment of a suite of assays that support the discovery of proteasome stimulators.</a></h2><p>The proteasome catalyzes the degradation of many mis-folded proteins, which are otherwise cytotoxic. There is interest in the discovery of proteasome agonists, but previous efforts to do so have been disappointing.The cleavage of small fluorogenic peptides is used routinely as an assay to screen for proteasome modulators. We have developed follow-on assays that employ more physiologically relevant substrates.To demonstrate the efficacy of this workflow, the NIH Clinical Collection (NCC) was screened. While many compounds stimulated proteasome-mediated proteolysis of the pro-fluorogenic peptide substrates, most failed to evince activity in assays with larger peptide or protein substrates. We also show that two molecules claimed previously to be proteasome agonists, oleuropein and , indeed accelerate hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate, but have no effect on the turnover of a mis-folded protein in vitro or in cellulo. However, two small molecules from the NCC, MK-866 and AM-404, stimulate the proteasome-mediated turnover of a mis-folded protein in living cells by 3- to 4-fold.Assays that monitor the proteasome-mediated degradation of larger peptides and proteins can distinguish bona fide agonists from compounds only able to stimulate the cleavage of short, non-physiologically relevant peptides.A suite of assays has been established that allows the discovery of bona fide proteasome agonists. AM-404 and MK-866 can be useful tools for cell culture experiments, and can serve as scaffolds to generate more potent 20S stimulators.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To cope with oxidative stress, cells rely on a signaling pathway involving redox-sensitive genes. Herein, we examined the therapeutic efficacy of the small molecule Ginkgolic acid (GA), a Sumoylation antagonist, to disrupt aberrant Sumoylation signaling in human and mouse lens epithelial cells (LECs) facing oxidative stress or aberrantly expressing Sumo1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier). We found that GA globally reduced aberrant Sumoylation of proteins. In contrast,  (BA), a Sumoylation agonist, augmented the process. GA increased Sp1 and Prdx6 expression by disrupting the Sumoylation signaling, while BA repressed the expression of both molecules. In vitro DNA binding, transactivation, Sumoylation and expression assays revealed that GA enhanced Sp1 binding to GC-boxes in the Prdx6 promoter and upregulated its transcription. Cell viability and intracellular redox status assays showed that LECs pretreated with GA gained resistance against oxidative stress-driven aberrant Sumoylation signaling. Overall, our study revealed an unprecedented role for GA in LECs and provided new mechanistic insights into the use of GA in rescuing LECs from aging/oxidative stress-evoked dysregulation of Sp1/Prdx6 protective molecules.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28617146>Diospyros rhodocalyx (Tako-Na), a Thai folk medicine, associated with hypokalemia and generalized muscle weakness: a case series.</a></h2><p>Diospyros rhodocalyx (Tako-Na) is a Thai folk medicine purported to promote longevity, treat impotence, etc. We present patients with hypokalemia, weakness and hypertension after consuming Tako-Na tea.Case 1: A 61-year-old man was brought in nine hours after drinking 400-500 mL of Tako-Na tea. One handful of Tako-Na bark was boiled in water to make tea. He had vomiting and watery diarrhea six hours after drinking it. He took no medications and had no history of hypertension. The only remarkable vital sign was BP 167/90 mmHg. Physical examination revealed generalized muscle weakness. Laboratory findings were potassium 2.7 mmol/L, bicarbonate 24 mmol/L, and transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) 5.6. He was discharged the next day with a BP 140/90 mmHg and potassium 4.2 mmol/L. Case 2: A 78-year-old man, a friend of case 1, also drank Tako-Na tea from the same pot at the same time as case 1. He also had vomiting and diarrhea six hours later. He took no medications despite past history of hypertension (baseline SBP 140-160). Initial BP was 230/70 mmHg. He also had muscle weakness. Laboratory findings were potassium 3.3 mmol/L, bicarbonate 24 mmol/L, TTKG 7.37 and normal thyroid function. He was also discharged the next day with a BP 148/70 mmHg and potassium 4.2 mmol/L. Case 3-7: These were patients reported to a poison center and their potassium concentrations were 1.4, 1.4, 3.3, 1.3 and 1.2 mmol/L, respectively. Three of them were intubated and case 3 died.Tako-Na contains betulin, , taraxerone, lupeol, and lupenone. Their structures are similar to glycyrrhetic acid, the active metabolite of glycyrrhizic acid found in licorice which is well known to cause pseudoaldosteronism. Glycyrrhetic acid is potent in inhibiting 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and causes pseudoaldosteronism.

The treatment is limited, with variable efficacy of benznidazole and nifurtimox.  (BA), a triterpene, can be found in medicinal herbs and has a wide variety of biological and pharmacological activities. The objective was to evaluate  effects on the cell death mechanism in Trypanosoma cruzi strain Y. BA inhibited the growth of epimastigotes in periods of 24h (IC=73.43μM), 48h (IC=119.8μM) and 72h (IC=212.2μM) of incubation; of trypomastigotes (IC=51.88μM) in periods of 24h and intracellular amastigotes (IC=25.94μM) in periods of 24 and 48h of incubation, no toxicity on LLC-MK cells at the concentrations used. Analysis of the possible mechanism of parasite cell death showed alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential, alterations in cell membrane integrity, an increase in the formation of reactive oxygen species and increase swelling of the reservosomes.

OA and UA inhibited the transcription of genes related to peptidoglycan biosynthesis, thereby preventing bacterial growth. However, it is not clear whether this is the only pathway involved in the antimicrobial activity of these compounds against S. mutans. Therefore, we used quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and microarray analyses to examine the expression of genes related to essential metabolic pathways in S. mutans UA159 following incubation with OA, UA, or BA. An oligonucleotide array consisting of 5363 probes was designed to survey 1928 of the 1963 genes in the genome of S. mutans UA159. Genes that showed >2-fold changes in expression in response to the treatment conditions were annotated, and selected target genes involved in central metabolism were analyzed by qPCR. Microarray analysis confirmed that the gene expression patterns of the OA- and UA-treated cells differed from that of the BA-treated culture, indicating differences in the antimicrobial mechanism. In particular, the expression of pfk and pykF, coding for glycolysis regulatory proteins phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase, respectively, were significantly decreased in the OA and UA groups (P < 0.05), as were genes involved in fatty acid and amino acid synthesis. In addition, the microarray analysis confirmed previous qPCR results showing that peptidoglycan synthesis is down-regulated in the OA- and UA-treated groups. OA and UA also appear to decrease the generation of organic acids by S. mutans UA159, which would have an anticaries effect. Overall, these findings suggest that OA and UA affect multiple genes involved in the central metabolism of S. mutans, with inhibition of glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, amino acid synthesis, and peptidoglycan synthesis, all contributing to their antimicrobial activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30274214>Interactions between Triterpenes and a P-I Type Snake Venom Metalloproteinase: Molecular Simulations and Experiments.</a></h2><p>Small molecule inhibitors of snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) could provide a means to rapidly halt the progression of local tissue damage following viperid snake envenomations. In this study, we examine the ability of candidate compounds based on a pentacyclic triterpene skeleton to inhibit SVMPs. We leverage molecular dynamics simulations to estimate the free energies of the candidate compounds for binding to BaP1, a P-I type SVMP, and compare these results with experimental assays of proteolytic activity inhibition in a homologous enzyme (Batx-I). Both simulation and experiment suggest that  is the most active candidate, with the simulations predicting a standard binding free energy of Δ G ∘ = - 11.0 ± 1.4 kcal/mol. The simulations also reveal the atomic interactions that underlie binding between the triterpenic acids and BaP1, most notably the electrostatic interaction between carboxylate groups of the compounds and the zinc cofactor of BaP1. Together, our simulations and experiments suggest that occlusion of the S1 ' subsite is essential for inhibition of proteolytic activity. While all active compounds make hydrophobic contacts in the S1 ' site, β -boswellic acid, with its distinct carboxylate position, does not occlude the S1 ' site in simulation and exhibits negligible activity in experiment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27913938>Cardiotoxic and Dyslipidemic Effects of Doxorubicin and  Amide.</a></h2><p>Changes in the blood lipid spectrum and structural reorganization of the rat myocardium in response to injection of a single sublethal dose of doxorubicin (7 mg/kg) alone and in combination with course administration of betulonic acid amide (100 mg/kg/day for 14 days) were studied.  amide in the specified dose exhibited less pronounced cardiotoxic (necrobiotic impairment of cardiomyocytes) and dyslipidemic (increase of cholesterol and triglyceride levels) effects in comparison with doxorubicin.

The cases reported and the predictions for the near future are unthinkable. Food and Drug Administration data showed that 40% of the approved molecules are natural compounds or inspired by them, from which, 74% are used in anticancer therapy. In fact, natural products are viewed as more biologically friendly, that is less toxic to normal cells. In this review, the most recent and successful cases of secondary metabolites, including alkaloid, diterpene, triterpene and polyphenolic type compounds, with great anticancer potential are discussed. Focusing on the ones that are in clinical trial development or already used in anticancer therapy, therefore successful cases such as paclitaxel and homoharringtonine (in clinical use), curcumin and ingenol mebutate (in clinical trials) will be addressed.

Yarrowia lipolytica, as an oleaginous yeast, is a promising microbial cell factory for the production of highly hydrophobic compounds due to the ability of this organism to accumulate large amounts of lipids that can store hydrophobic products and supply sufficient precursors for terpene synthesis. However, engineering for the heterologous production of  and related triterpenoids has not developed as systematically as that for the production of other terpenoids, thus the production of  in microbes remains unsatisfactory.In this study, we applied a multimodular strategy to systematically improve the biosynthesis of  and related triterpenoids in Y. lipolytica by engineering four functional modules, namely, the heterogenous CYP/CPR, MVA, acetyl-CoA generation, and redox cofactor supply modules. First, by screening 25 combinations of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductases (CPRs), each of which originated from 5 different sources, we selected two optimal -producing strains. Then, ERG1, ERG9, and HMG1 in the MVA module were overexpressed in the two strains, which dramatically increased  production and resulted in a strain (YLJCC56) that exhibited the highest  yield of 51.87 ± 2.77 mg/L. Then, we engineered the redox cofactor supply module by introducing NADPH- or NADH-generating enzymes and the acetyl-CoA generation module by directly overexpressing acetyl-CoA synthases or reinforcing the β-oxidation pathway, which further increased the total triterpenoid yield (the sum of the betulin, , betulinic aldehyde yields). Finally, we engineered these modules in combination, and the total triterpenoid yield reached 204.89 ± 11.56 mg/L (composed of 65.44% betulin, 23.71%  and 10.85% betulinic aldehyde) in shake flask cultures.Here, we systematically engineered Y. lipolytica and achieved, to the best of our knowledge, the highest  and total triterpenoid yields reported in microbes.

(BA), a natural pentacyclic triterpenoid, has been reported to be involved in anti-inflammation, in particular having an inhibitory effect on proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 17 (IL-17) and interferon- (IFN-) production. In this study, we screened BA derivatives and found a BA derivative, SH479, that had a greater inhibitory effect on T17 differentiation. Our further analysis showed that SH479 had a greater inhibitory effect on T17 and T1, and a more stimulatory effect on regulatory T (Treg) cells. To evaluate the effects of SH479 on autoimmune diseases in vivo, we employed the extensively used MS mouse model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our results showed that SH479 ameliorated clinical and histologic signs of EAE in both prevention and therapeutic protocols by regulating the T17/Treg balance. SH479 dose-dependently reduced splenic lymphocyte proinflammatory factors and increased anti-inflammatory factors. Moreover, SH479 specifically inhibited splenic lymphocyte viability from EAE mice but not normal splenic lymphocyte viability. At the molecular level, SH479 inhibited T17 differentiation by regulating signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) phosphorylation, DNA binding activity, and recruitment to the  promoter in CD4 T cells. Furthermore, SH479 promoted the STAT5 signaling pathway and inhibited the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) signaling pathway. Together, our data demonstrated that SH479 ameliorated EAE by regulating the T17/Treg balance through inhibiting the STAT3 and NF-B  while activating the STAT5 pathway, suggesting that SH479 is a potential novel drug candidate for autoimmune diseases including MS.Copyright © 2017 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26647913> Kills Colon Cancer Stem Cells.</a></h2><p>Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered to be the origin of cancer and it is suggested that they are resistant to chemotherapy. Current therapies fail to eradicate CSCs and therefore selecting a resistant cell subset that is able to facilitate tumor recurrences.  (BetA) is a broad acting natural compound, shown to induce cell death via the inhibition of the stearoyl-CoA- desaturase (SCD- 1). This enzyme converts saturated fatty acids into unsaturated fatty acids and is over-expressed in tumor cells. Here we show that BetA induces rapid cell death in all colon CSCs tested and is able to affect the CSCs directly as shown, via the loss of clonogenic capacity. Similar results were observed with inhibition of SCD-1, suggesting that SCD-1 activity is indeed a vulnerable link in colon CSCs and can be considered an ideal target for therapy in colon cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27463705>Estrogen Receptor Signaling and the PI3K/Akt Pathway Are Involved in -Induced eNOS Activation.</a></h2><p> (BA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid with anti-inflammatory, antiviral and anti-cancer properties. Beneficial cardiovascular effects such as increased nitric oxide (NO) production through enhancement of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity and upregulation of eNOS expression have been demonstrated for this compound. In the present study, immortalized human EA.hy 926 endothelial cells were incubated for up to 1 h with 1-100 µM BA and with the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin, or the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI 182,780. Phosphorylation status of eNOS and total eNOS protein were analyzed by Western blotting using a serine 1177 phosphosite-specific antibody. Bioactive NO production was assessed by determination of cGMP content in rat lung fibroblasts (RFL-6) reporter cells. Short-term incubation of EA.hy 926 cells with BA resulted in eNOS phosphorylation at the serine 1177 residue in a concentration- and time-dependent manner with a half-maximal effective concentration of 0.57 µM. This was associated with an enhanced production of NO. BA-induced eNOS phosphorylation and NO production was completely blocked by pretreatment with ICI 182,780, and was attenuated by pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002. These results indicate that fast non-genomic effects of ER with downstream signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway and consecutive eNOS phosphorylation at serine 1177 are involved in BA-induced eNOS activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27965071>A  derivative SH479 inhibits collagen-induced arthritis by modulating T cell differentiation and cytokine balance.</a></h2><p>The ideal therapeutic drug for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) should not only inhibit inflammation, but also prevent articular joint damage and particularly inhibit osteoclastogenesis.  (BA) is a natural pentacyclic triterpene that has displayed moderate anti-inflammatory and anti-osteoclastogenesis activities in various experimental systems, suggesting that BA or its derivatives could have an inhibitory effect on RA. In this study, we screened BA derivatives and found a heterocyclic ring-fused BA derivative, SH479, which had greater inhibitory effect than BA on Th17 differentiation. Moreover, we investigated the immune regulatory activity and potential therapeutic effects of SH479 in an experimental model of rheumatoid arthritis, the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. SH479 significantly inhibited Th1 and Th17 polarization, antigen-specific T cell proliferation and splenic lymphocyte-induced osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, it diminished arthritis scores as well as bone destruction and cartilage depletion in the CIA mouse model. The protective effect of SH479 was accompanied by decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IFN-γ, together with enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokine expression including IL-10 and IL-4, as well as elevated CD4 Foxp3 cell number. At the molecular level, our results indicated that SH479 alleviated CIA through regulation of CD4 T cell subtypes by JAK-STAT . In conclusion, this study demonstrates that SH479 has therapeutic potential for rheumatoid arthritis through an anti-inflammatory effect by shifting a pathogenic Th17/Th1 response to a Th2/Treg phenotype, and also through an additional articular bone protection effect.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, the effects of BA treatment on liver cancer have little to be known. Thus, the study is conducted to explore the in vitro and in vivo role of BA in liver cancer. And the interactions between BA and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand of APO2, also known as TRAIL, were investigated in liver cancer cells. A synergistic effect of BA and APO2 combination on apoptosis induction in liver cancer cells was observed. The cancer cells were insensitive to APO2 single therapy. However, liver cancer cells receiving BA were sensitive to APO2-triggered apoptotic response by enhancing Caspases cleavage, due to elevation of decoy receptor 1 and 2 (DcR1 and DcR2) dependent on p53. Bcl-2 family members of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, belonging to anti-apoptosis, were decreased, whereas Bad and Bak, as pro-apoptotic members, were increased for BA and APO2 combined treatment. Additionally, the mouse xenograft model suggested that BA and APO2 in combination markedly inhibited liver cancer growth in comparison to BA or APO2 monotherapy without toxicity. The present study revealed a dramatically therapeutic strategy for promoting APO2-induced anti-cancer effects on liver cancer cells via BA combination.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The purpose of the study was to explore the therapeutic potential of  in bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) induced VaD in experimental rats. VaD was induced by BCCAO in rats and  (10 and 15 mg/kg/day po) was administered 1 week after surgery. The cerebral blood pressure of the animal was recorded before and after the treatment using Laser Doppler flow meter. Object recognition task for non-spatial, Morris water maze for spatial and locomotor activity was performed to evaluate behavioral changes in rats. At the end of the study, animals were decapitated and hippocampus was separated to perform biochemical, neuroinflammatory and second messengers cAMP/cGMP analysis. Histology was done to study the brain pathophysiology. BCCAO surgery was able to significantly impaired memory in rats as observed behavioral and biochemical parameters. Moreover, BA demonstrated a neuroprotective effect in a dose-dependent manner. BA was able to re-establish cerebral blood flow, restore behavioral parameters and showed significant improvements in the as cAMP,cGMP and BDNF levels, restrain the oxidative stress and inflammatory parameters. In histopathology,  treated groups showed a decrease in microgliosis and less pathological abnormalities comparable to diseased rat's brain.

Results we examined the involvement of CXC chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) on the mechanical sensitivity of inflamed periodontal tissue, using a mouse model of periodontitis established by the ligation of the tooth cervix of a maxillary second molar and inoculation with Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis). Infiltration of inflammatory cells into gingival tissue was not observed following the inoculation. Under light anesthesia, the mechanical head withdrawal threshold (MHWT) on the buccal gingiva was measured using an electronic von Frey anesthesiometer. No significant changes in MHWT were observed in the mice with P. gingivalis-induced periodontitis during the experimental period. Continuous administration of CXCR4 neutralizing antibody to the gingival tissue significantly decreased MHWT and increased the number of gingival CXCR4 immunoreactive macrophages in the periodontitis group. Nitric oxide metabolites in the gingival tissue were significantly increased after the inoculation of P. gingivalis and were reduced by gingival CXCR4 neutralization. Gingival L-arginine administration induced gingival mechanical allodynia in naive animals. Moreover, the decrease in MHWT after treatment with P. gingivalis and CXCR4 neutralization was partially reversed by nitric oxide synthase inhibition in the gingival tissue. Nuclear factor-kappa B was expressed in infiltrating macrophages after inoculation of P. gingivalis and administration of the nuclear factor-kappa B activator  induced gingival mechanical allodynia in naive mice. Conclusions These findings suggest that CXCR4 signaling inhibits nitric oxide release from infiltrating macrophages and is involved in modulation of the mechanical sensitivity in the periodontal tissue in P. gingivalis-induced periodontitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29660337>Effect of  and its ionic derivatives on M-MuLV replication.</a></h2><p>Murine leukemia virus (MuLV) is a retrovirus known causing leukemia and neurological disorders in mice, and its viral life cycle and pathogenesis have been investigated extensively over the past decades. As a natural antiviral agent,  is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that can be found in the bark of several species of plants (particularly the white birch). One of the hurdles for  to release its antiviral potency is its poor water solubility. In this study, we synthesized more water-soluble ionic derivatives of , and examined their activities against Moloney MuLV (M-MuLV). The mouse fibroblast cells stably infected with M-MuLV, 43D cells, were treated with various doses of betulinic acids and its derivatives, and the viral structural protein Gag in cells and media were detected by western blots. Two ionic derivatives containing the benzalkonium cation were found to inhibit the virus production into media and decreased Gag in cells. However, a cell proliferation assay showed that the benzalkonium cation inhibited the growth of 43D cells, suggesting that our ionic derivatives limited virus production through the inhibition of  in 43D cells. Interestingly, all of these  compounds exhibited a minimum impact on the processing and release of Gag from 43D cells, which outlines the differences of viral maturation between MuLV and human immunodeficiency virus.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, its efficacy is limited by its poor aqueous solubility and relatively short half-life. In this study, BA-monomethoxy polyethylene glycol (mPEG) conjugate was synthesized by covalent coupling the C-28 carboxylic acid position of BA with amine groups of mPEG, in order to improve its solubility and anticancer efficacy. mPEG-BA conjugate was characterized using various analytical techniques including NMR, FT-IR and MALDI-MS. The mPEG-BA conjugate was cytotoxic, demonstrated internalization and induced cell apoptosis in Hep3B and Huh7 hepatic cancer cells. The western-blot analysis revealed, marked decrease in Bcl-2/Bax ratio, and increase in cleaved-PARP and cleaved-caspase-3 expressions. In vivo studies in Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) model following intravenous administration demonstrated significant reduction in tumor volume in case of PEGylated BA as compare to native BA. Furthermore, PEGylated BA treated EAT mice showed no biochemical and histological toxicities. These findings demonstrate the potential of PEGylated BA in cancer therapy, with improved water solubility and efficacy.Copyright © 2016.

Here we investigated the immunomodulatory activity of eight semi-synthetic amide derivatives of . Screening of derivatives BA1-BA8 led to the identification of compounds with superior immunomodulatory activity than BA on activated macrophages and lymphocytes. BA5, the most potent derivative, inhibited nitric oxide and TNFα production in a concentration-dependent manner, and decreased NF-κB activation in Raw 264.7 cells. Additionally, BA5 inhibited the proliferation of activated lymphocytes and the secretion of IL-2, IL-4 IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A and IFNɣ, in a concentration-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis in lymphocyte cultures showed that treatment with BA5 induces cell cycle arrest in pre-G1 phase followed by cell death by apoptosis. Moreover, BA5 also inhibited the activity of calcineurin, an enzyme that plays a critical role in the progression of cell cycle and T lymphocyte activation. BA5 has a synergistic inhibitory effect with dexamethasone on lymphoproliferation, showing a promising profile for drug combination. Finally, we observed immunosuppressive effects of BA5 in vivo in mouse models of lethal endotoxemia and delayed type hypersensitivity.

To overcome its poor aqueous solubility and low bioavailability, structural modifications of its functional groups are made to generate novel lead(s) having better efficacy and less toxicity than the parent compound. BA analogue, 2c was found most potent inhibitor of colon cancer cell line, HT-29 cells with IC50 value 14.9 μM which is significantly lower than standard drug 5-fluorouracil as well as parent compound, . We have studied another mode of PCD, autophagy which is one of the important constituent of cellular catabolic system as well as we also studied proteasomal degradation pathway to investigate whole catabolic pathway after exploration of 2c on HT-29 cells.Mechanism of autophagic cell death was studied using fluorescent dye like acridine orange (AO) and monodansylcadaverin (MDC) staining by using fluorescence microscopy. Various autophagic protein expression levels were determined by Western Blotting, qRT-PCR and Immunostaining. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) was used to study the colocalization of various autophagic proteins. These were accompanied by formation of autophagic vacuoles as revealed by FACS and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Proteasomal degradation pathway was studied by proteasome-Glo™ assay systems using luminometer.The formation of autophagic vacuoles in HT-29 cells after 2c treatment was determined by fluorescence staining--confirming the occurrence of autophagy. In addition, 2c was found to alter expression levels of different autophagic proteins like Beclin-1, Atg 5, Atg 7, Atg 5-Atg 12, LC3B and autophagic adapter protein, p62. Furthermore we found the formation of autophagolysosome by colocalization of LAMP-1 with LC3B, LC3B with Lysosome, p62 with lysosome. Finally, as proteasomal degradation pathway downregulated after 2c treatment colocalization of ubiquitin with lysosome and LC3B with p62 was studied to confirm that protein degradation in autophagy induced HT-29 cells follows autolysosomal pathway.In summary,  analogue, 2c was able to induce autophagy in HT-29 cells and as proteasomal degradation pathway downregulated after 2c treatment so protein degradation in autophagy induced HT-29 cells follows autolysosomal pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29382964>Safety evaluation of a new anxiolytic product containing botanicals  spp. and  spp. in dogs.</a></h2><p>Separation anxiety and noise aversion are common behavioral problems in dogs.

They do all occur in combination in European mistletoe (Viscum album L.). Commercial Viscum album L. extracts are aqueous, excluding the insoluble triterpenes. We have previously shown that mistletoe lectins and triterpene acids are effective against Ewing sarcoma in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo.We recreated a total mistletoe effect (viscumTT) by combining an aqueous extract (viscum) and a triterpene extract (TT) solubilised with cyclodextrins and analysed the effects of viscumTT and the single extracts on TC-71 Ewing sarcoma cells in vitro by transcriptomic and proteomic profiling.Treatment with the extracts strongly impacted Ewing sarcoma cell gene and protein expression. Apoptosis-associated and stress-activated genes were upregulated, proteasomal protein abundance enhanced and ribosomal and spliceosomal proteins downregulated. The mechanism of action of viscum, TT and viscumTT in TC-71 and MHH-ES-1 cells suggests the involvement of the unfolded protein response. While viscum and viscumTT extract treatment indicate response to oxidative stress and activation of stress-mediated MAPK signalling, TT extract treatment suggests the involvement of TLR signalling and autophagy.Since the combinatory extract viscumTT exerts highly effective pro-apoptotic effects on Ewing sarcoma cells in vitro, this phytopolychemotherapy could be a promising adjuvant therapeutic option for paediatric patients with Ewing sarcoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29413572>Comparative pharmacokinetics of triterpenic acids in normal and immunosuppressed rats after oral administration of Jujubae Fructus extract by UPLC-MS/MS.</a></h2><p>The fruit of Ziziphus jujuba (Jujubae Fructus) has been used as food and crude drug for thousands of years. Although several chemical and biological studies have revealed triterpenic acid as the main bioactive constituent of Jujubae Fructus responsible for immune-regulatory activity, only few pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted. To comprehend the kinetics of triterpenic acids and promote their curative application, a sensitive and efficient ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry method (UPLC-MS/MS) was established. UPLC-MS/MS was applied for the simultaneous determination of ceanothic acid, epiceanothic acid, pomonic acid, alphitolic acid, maslinic acid, , and betulonic acid in normal and immunosuppressed rat plasma samples. After sample preparation, chromatographic separation was performed on an Acquity UPLC BEH C column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm) with acetonitrile: methanol (1:1, v/v) and 0.5% ammonium acetate in water as mobile phase. The established method was validated and found to be specific, accurate, and precise for the seven triterpenic acids, and was successfully applied for the pharmacokinetic study of rat plasma samples. The results showed that the pharmacokinetic parameters (C, T, AUC, AUC and CLz/F) in the plasma samples of immunosuppressed rats were significantly different from those in normal rats, and might provide an insight for the clinical usage of triterpenic acids from Jujubae Fructus.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The method is based on the chelation effect of zirconium (Zr(4+)) ions on the phosphate group, which may induce aggregation of 4-aminophenylphosphate-functionalized gold nanoparticles (APP/AuNPs) and the corresponding color change of the testing solution. Owing to the dephosphorylation of PTP1B, the aggregation of AuNPs will be influenced by PTP1B since there is no coordination reactivity between Zr(4+) ions and 4-aminophenol, the hydrolyzed product of APP catalyzed by the enzyme. Therefore, a simple colorimetric method for the assay of PTP1B activity can be developed. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the ratios of absorbance at a wavelength of 650 nm to that at 522 nm vary linearly with the PTP1B activity in the range from 0.005 to 0.18 U mL(-1) with the lowest detection limit of 0.0017 U mL(-1). Moreover, using this proposed method, the inhibition effect of 6-chloro-3-formyl-7-methylchromone, , ursolic acid, and sodium orthovanadate on PTP1B activity can be tested with IC50 values of 10, 13, 9, and 1.1 μM, respectively.

Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) play key roles in the structural diversification of plant triterpenoids. Among these, the CYP716A subfamily, which functions mainly as a triterpene C-28 oxidase, is common in plants. Licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis) produces bioactive triterpenoids, such as glycyrrhizin and soyasaponins, and relevant P450s (CYP88D6, CYP72A154, and CYP93E3) have been identified; however, no CYP716A subfamily P450 has been isolated. Here, we identify CYP716A179, which functions as a triterpene C-28 oxidase, by RNA sequencing analysis of tissue-cultured stolons of G. uralensis. Heterologous expression of CYP716A179 in engineered yeast strains confirmed the production of oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, and  from β-amyrin, α-amyrin, and lupeol, respectively. The transcript level of CYP716A179 was about 500 times higher in tissue-cultured stolons than in intact roots. Oleanolic acid and  were consistently detected only in tissue-cultured stolons.

The betulinyl sulfamates were subjected to inhibit carbonic anhydrases (CA), e.g. CAIX, an attractive target for tumor-selective therapy strategies in cancer cells. Data on combined in vitro antitumor activity with CAIX inhibition are very rare. The betulinyl sulfamates were tested against five tumor cell lines and normal human skin fibroblasts. The mode of cell death on MCF7 breast cancer cells induced by the most active compounds CAI1, CAI3 and CAI6 was investigated by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) experiments. The compounds showed inhibitory activity towards CAIX, which was determined via in vitro enz-yme assay. Our preliminary investigations revealed that all compounds showed potent anticancer properties with IC values below 20 μM against all tumor cells. Interestingly, among the panel of sulfamate conjugates, CAI3 found to be highly cytotoxic (average IC = 5-10 μM) and possess high inhibitory activity (K = 1.25 nM) towards CAIX.

Here, we showed that in LNCaP and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells transiently overexpressing androgen receptor splice variant-7 (AR-V7), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) was activated and could result in up-regulated interleukin () gene expression, indicating a positive interaction between AR-V7 expression and activated NF-κB/IL-6 signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) pathogenesis. Importantly, both AR-V7-induced NF-κB activation and  gene transcription in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells could be inhibited by melatonin. Furthermore, stimulation of  mRNA expression in LNCaP cells by , a pharmacological NF-κB activator, was reduced by melatonin treatment. Our data support the presence of bi-directional positive interactions between AR-V7 expression and NF-κB activation in CRPC pathogenesis. Of note, melatonin, by inhibiting NF-κB activation via the previously-reported MT₁ receptor-mediated antiproliferative pathway, can disrupt these bi-directional positive interactions between AR-V7 and NF-κB and thereby delay the development of castration resistance in advanced prostate cancer.

Plants have been shown to be a good source for the development of new antimalarial chemotherapeutic agents, as shown for the discovery of quinine and artemisinin derivatives. Our research group has been working with semisynthetic triterpene derivatives that show potential antimalarial activity toward different strains of Plasmodium falciparum by specifically modulating calcium  in the parasite. Promising results were obtained for nanomolar concentrations of the semisynthetic  derivative LAFIS13 against the P. falciparum 3D7 strain in vitro, with a selectivity index of 18 compared to a mammalian cell line. Continuing these studies, we present here in vitro and in vivo toxicological evaluations of this compound, followed by docking studies with PfATP6, a sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA) protein. LAFIS13 showed an LD between 300 and 50 mg/kg, and the acute administration of 50 mg/kg (i.p.) had no negative effects on hematological, biochemical and histopathological parameters. Based on the results of the in vitro assays, LAFIS13 not exerted significant effects on coagulation parameters of human peripheral blood, but a hemolytic activity was verified at higher concentrations. According to the molecular docking study, the PfATP6 protein may be a target for LAFIS13, which corroborates its previously reported modulatory effects on calcium homeostasis in the parasite. Notably, LAFIS13 showed a higher selectivity for the mammalian SERCA protein than for PfATP6, thus impairing the selectivity between parasite and host. In summary, the direct interaction with calcium pumps and the hemolytic potential of the compound proved to be plausible mechanism of LAFIS13 toxicity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Importantly, no such report is available demonstrating the involvement of BA or its structural analogs in the modulation of PI3K pathway. Using, human leukemia HL-60 cells as a model, we for the first time report that CBA decreased expression of PI3K p110α, p85α, and pAKT in HL-60. Furthermore, we could find significant depletion of pGSK3β, cyclin D1 and increased expression of p21/cip, p27/Kip proteins. CBA induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, increased sub-G0 DNA fraction and annexin V binding of the cells besides imparting the typical surface features of cell death. Also, this target specific inhibition was associated with mitochondrial apoptosis as was reflected by expression studies of various proteins together with reactive oxygen species generation and decline in mitochondrial trans membrane potential. The apoptotic effectors i.e., caspase 8 and caspase 9 were found to get upregulated besides PI3K associated DNA repair enzyme i.e., PARP cleavage was observed.

It is currently believed that both classes act by similar modes of action to generate aberrant noninfectious particles via inhibition of CA-SP1 cleavage during Gag proteolytic processing. In this study, we utilized a series of novel analogues with decreasing similarity to PF-46396 to determine the chemical groups within PF-46396 that contribute to antiviral activity, Gag binding, and the relationship between these essential properties. A spectrum of antiviral activity (active, intermediate, and inactive) was observed across the analogue series with respect to CA-SP1 cleavage and HIV-1 (NL4-3) replication kinetics in Jurkat T cells. We demonstrate that selected inactive analogues are incorporated into wild-type (WT) immature particles and that one inactive analogue is capable of interfering with PF-46396 inhibition of CA-SP1 cleavage. Mutations that confer PF-46396 resistance can impose a defective phenotype on HIV-1 that can be rescued in a compound-dependent manner. Some inactive analogues retained the capacity to rescue PF-46396-dependent mutants (SP1-A3V, SP1-A3T, and CA-P157S), implying that they can also interact with mutant Gag. The structure-activity relationships observed in this study demonstrate that (i) the tert-butyl group is essential for antiviral activity but is not an absolute requirement for Gag binding, (ii) the trifluoromethyl group is optimal but not essential for antiviral activity, and (iii) the 2-aminoindan group is important for antiviral activity and Gag binding but is not essential, as its replacement is tolerated.Combinations of antiretroviral drugs successfully treat HIV/AIDS patients; however, drug resistance problems make the development of new mechanistic drug classes an ongoing priority. HIV-1 maturation inhibitors are novel as they target the Gag protein, specifically by inhibiting CA-SP1 proteolytic cleavage. The lack of high-resolution structural information of the CA-SP1 target in Gag has hindered our understanding of the inhibitor-binding pocket and maturation inhibitor mode of action. Therefore, we utilized analogues of the maturation inhibitor PF-46396 as chemical tools to determine the chemical components of PF-46396 that contribute to antiviral activity and Gag binding and the relationship between these essential properties. This is the first study to report structure-activity relationships of the maturation inhibitor PF-46396. PF-46396 is chemically distinct from -derived maturation inhibitors; therefore, our data provide a foundation of knowledge that will aid our understanding of how structurally distinct maturation inhibitors act by similar modes of action.Copyright © 2016 Murgatroyd et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684465> suppresses breast cancer aerobic glycolysis via caveolin-1/NF-κB/c-Myc pathway.</a></h2><p>Emerging evidence has suggested that targeting glycolysis may be a promising strategy for cancer treatment.  (BA) is a natural pentacyclic terpene that has been reported to be active in inhibiting various malignancies. Here, we showed that BA could inhibit aerobic glycolysis activity in breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 by hampering lactate production, glucose uptake and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), as well as suppressing aerobic glycolysis-related proteins including c-Myc, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) and p-PDK1/PDK1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1). Mechanistic studies validated Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) as one of key targets of BA in suppressing aerobic glycolysis, as BA administration resulted in Cav-1 upregulation, whereas silencing Cav-1 abrogated the inhibitory effect of BA on aerobic glycolysis. Further investigations demonstrated that BA suppressed aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer cells by regulating the Cav-1/NF-κB/c-Myc pathway. More meaningfully, BA significantly inhibited breast cancer growth and glycolytic activity in both the transgenic MMTV-PyVT breast cancer spontaneous model and the zebrafish breast cancer xenotransplantation model without any detectable side effects in vivo. Taken together, our study sheds novel insights into BA as a promising candidate drug for suppressing aerobic glycolysis, highlighting Cav-1 as a potential molecular target of BA and aerobic glycolysis regulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study was conducted to evaluate the potency of self-assembled  (SA-BA) against DOX induced chemotherapeutic toxicity in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). The isolated  from the bark of Ziziphus jujuba tree was purified by column chromatography and characterized by FT-IR, XRD, (1)H NMR and self-assembly property was investigated by SEM imaging. DOX treatment produced significant reduction of viability of PBLs mainly by lowering cellular anti-oxidant pool and elevating the reactive oxygen species level. Pre-treatment with SA-BA followed by DOX exposure for 24h protected the PBLs from DOX induced oxidative stress. Potent anti-apoptotic role of SA-BA was also confirmed by FACS analysis and western blot assay. Severe inflammation is one of the major concerns in DOX treatment. We found that pre-treatment with SA-BA on PBLs significantly protected the PBLs from DOX induced inflammation. Thus, our finding confirms that SA-BA can be used to ameliorate the cytotoxic effects of DOX, which can be a helpful strategy during DOX mediated chemotherapy in cancer patients.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Several phytochemical-derived anticancer drugs including curcumin, , phenethylisothiocyanate and celastrol, and many others induce reactive oxygen species, and their effects on gene regulation show some overlap in various cancer cell lines. We hypothesize that reactive oxygen species-inducing anticancer agents and many other natural products target a common pathway in cancer cells, which initially involves downregulation of specificity protein 1 (Sp1), Sp3, and Sp4, which are highly expressed in tumors/cell lines derived from solid tumors. This hypothesis is supported by several published reports showing that a large number of phytochemical-derived anticancer agents downregulate Sp1, Sp3, Sp4, and pro-oncogenic Sp-regulated genes involved in cell growth (cyclin D1 and growth factor receptors), survival (bcl-2 and survivin), angiogenesis and migration (MMP-9, vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptors), and inflammation (NF-kB). The contribution of this pathway to the anticancer activity of drugs such as curcumin, celastrol, , and phenethylisothiocyanate must be determined in order to optimize clinical applications of drug combinations containing these compounds.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30583403>NMR-based systematic analysis of bioactive phytochemicals in red wine.

However, a systematic analysis of the major healthy molecules contained in wines has not been conducted yet. Our study explored the potential arsenal of beneficial molecules contained in wine from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective. The experimental approach was based on chromatography and untargeted NMR spectroscopy. In addition to already known bioactive molecules, for the first time, xanthurenic acid and oleanic acid were identified in wine in relatively high concentrations. On account of their many biological activities, these two molecules widen the range of potential beneficial effects of wine and pave the way toward the evaluation of their still unexplored sensory properties.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The derivatization reaction was screened for influential factors and statistically significant parameters with a p value less than 0.05. A multi-response optimization based on a desirability function was then applied, while simultaneously considering overall detection enhancement of compounds. Results showed that derivatization using N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) in pyridine (22:13:65v/v/v) for 2h at 30°C was the most efficient method of derivatizing all the hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups contained in the triterpene structures. The validity of the method was demonstrated using GC-MS analyzes of a mixture containing eleven standards (β-amyrin, α-amyrin, lupeol, erythrodiol, uvaol, betulin, oleanolic acid, , ursolic acid, maslinic acid and corosolic acid). These compounds are representative of different classes of terpene compounds bearing different functional groups such as alcohols, diols, and carboxylic acids. The derivatization procedure was then tested on four plant extracts: apple pomace, salvia sclarea (dried leaves and flowers), sea buckthorn (Hyppophae rhammnoides L.) berries, and B. serrata resin. The identification of triterpenes was based on the comparison of their retention time and mass spectra to those of standards. The presence of compounds already identified in the literature was confirmed and new ones such as maslinic and corosolic acids were identified in apples, sea buckthorn and salvia sclarea.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we performed bio-guided fractionation of Betula utilis Bark (BUB), in which it was extracted in methanol and fractionated with hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, n-butanol and water. All six fractions were evaluated for their in-vitro anticancer activity in nine different cancer cell lines and ethyl acetate fraction was found to be one of the most potent fractions in terms of inducing cytotoxic activity against various cancer cell lines. By utilizing column chromatography, six triterpenes namely betulin, , lupeol, ursolic acid (UA), oleanolic acid and β-amyrin have been isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of BUB and structures of these compounds were unraveled by spectroscopic methods. β-amyrin and UA were isolated for the first time from Betula utilis. Isolated triterpenes were tested for in-vitro cytotoxic activity against six different cancer cell lines where UA was found to be selective for breast cancer cells over non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells (MCF 10A). Tumor cell selective apoptotic action of UA was mainly attributed due to the activation of extrinsic apoptosis pathway via up regulation of DR4, DR5 and PARP cleavage in MCF-7 cells over non-tumorigenic MCF-10A cells. Moreover, UA mediated intracellular ROS generation and mitochondrial membrane potential disruption also play a key role for its anti cancer effect. UA also inhibits breast cancer migration. Altogether, we discovered novel source of UA having potent tumor cell specific cytotoxic property, indicating its therapeutic potential against breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28334682>Phytochemical-induced nucleolar stress results in the inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation.</a></h2><p>The nucleolus is a stress sensor and compromised nucleolar activity may be considered as an attractive anticancer strategy. In the present study, the effects of three plant-derived natural compounds, i.e., sulforaphane (SFN), ursolic acid (UA) and  (BA) on nucleolar state were investigated in breast cancer cell lines of different receptor status, namely MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 cells. Cytostatic action of phytochemicals against breast cancer cells was observed at low micromolar concentration window (5-20µM) and mediated by elevated p21 levels, and cell proliferation of SFN-, UA- and BA-treated normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) was unaffected. Phytochemical-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation was accompanied by increased levels of superoxide and protein carbonylation that lead to disorganization of A- and B-type lamin  and alterations in the nuclear architecture. Phytochemicals promoted nucleolar stress as judged by the nucleoplasmic translocation of RNA polymerase I-specific transcription initiation factor RRN3/TIF-IA, inhibition of new rRNA synthesis and decrease in number of nucleoli. Phytochemicals also decreased the levels of NOP2, proliferation-associated nucleolar protein p120, and WDR12 required for maturation of 28S and 5.8S ribosomal RNAs and formation of the 60S ribosome, and phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein that may result in diminished translation and inhibition of cell proliferation. In summary, three novel ribotoxic stress stimuli were revealed with a potential to be used in nucleolus-focused anticancer therapy.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about the effect of BA on normal cells. In this study, the effects of BA on normal neuronal cell apoptosis and the mechanisms involved were studied using differentiated PC12 cells as a model. Treatment with 50 μM BA for 24 h apparently induced PC12 cell apoptosis. In the early stage of apoptosis, the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased. Afterwards, the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, the release of cytochrome c and the activation of caspase-3 occurred. Treatment with antioxidants could significantly reduce BA-induced PC12 cell apoptosis. In conclusion, we report for the first time that BA induced the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in differentiated PC12 cells through ROS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28950663> protects the neuronal damage in new born rats from isoflurane-induced apoptosis in the developing brain by blocking FASL-FAS signaling pathway.</a></h2><p> (BA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic lupane group triterpenoid, has reported to protect cerebral ischemia. Present study evaluates the protective effect of  on the isoflurane-induced neuronal damage in neonatal mice. All the mice of 7days age were exposed to isoflurane (2%; 2h) for the duration of 3day. At the end of protocol cognitive function was evaluated by Morris water maze (MWM) test. However count of apoptotic cells were estimated by TUNEL staining. Concentration of oxidative stress parameters [superoxide dismutase (SOD); catalase (CAT) and reduced glutathione (GSH)], cytokines [tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α); interlukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1β] and expressions of caspase 3, FAS and FASL were estimated in the neuronal cells. Result of the study suggested that treatment with  significantly reduces the escape latency and enhances platform crossing time than negative control group. Count of apoptotic cells were also found to be reduced in BA treated group of mice than negative control group. Moreover treatment with BA significantly attenuates the concentration of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress in isoflurane induced neonatal mice. However expressions of caspase-3, FAS/FASL was found to be significantly reduced in BA treated group of mice than negative control group.

Renal fibrosis is a complication of kidney injury and associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. In our previous investigation, a lupane-type pentacyclic triterpenoid,  (BA) was found to have protective effect on chronic kidney disease (CKD) and renal fibrosis. This prompted us to explore the therapeutic value of UA, a chemically related compound to BA in CKD. CKD was induced by feeding adenine with the feed at a concentration of 0.75% for 28 days. UA at the dose rate of 30 mg/kg in 0.5% carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) was administered by oral route, simultaneously with adenine feeding for 28 days. Adenine feeding increased the kidney weight to body weight index, decreased the kidney function due to injury as indicated by increased markers like serum urea, uric acid, creatinine, cystatin C and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and initiated the fibrotic response in kidney by increasing the profibrotic proteins viz. transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), fibronectin and collagen. However, treatment with UA reversed the damage induced by adenine as shown by reduced kidney injury and fibrosis markers which was further clearly evident in histological picture indicating the suitability of UA for use in CKD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In our previous study, two pentacyclic triterpene derivatives (Q8 and Y3) have been found to have anti-influenza virus entry activities. Keeping the potential synergy of biological activity of pentacyclic triterpenes and l-ascorbic acid in mind, we synthesized a series of novel l-ascorbic acid-conjugated pentacyclic triterpene derivatives (18-26, 29-31, 35-40 and 42-43). Moreover, we evaluated these novel compounds for their anti-influenza activities against A/WSN/33 virus in MDCK cells. Among all evaluated compounds, the 2,3-O,O-dibenzyl-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid- conjugate (30) showed the most significant anti-influenza activity with an EC50 of 8.7 μM, and no cytotoxic effects on MDCK cells were observed. Time-of-addition assay indicated that compound 30 acted at an early stage of the influenza life cycle. Further analyses revealed that influenza virus-induced hemagglutination of chicken red blood cells was inhibited by treatment of compound 30, and the interaction between the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and compound 30 was determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with a dissociation constant of KD = 3.76 μM. Finally, silico docking studies indicated that compound 30 and its derivative 31 were able to occupy the binding pocket of HA for sialic acid receptor. Collectively, these results suggested that l-ascorbic acid-conjugated pentacyclic triterpenes were promising anti-influenza entry inhibitors, and HA protein associated with viral entry was a promising drug target.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Alterations in cellular bioenergetics through the regulation of 5' adenosine monophosphate‑activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling may be a prerequisite to stemness.  (BA) is a well‑known bioactive compound with antiretroviral and anti‑inflammatory potential, which has been reported to exert anticancer effects on various types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer. The present study aimed to investigate whether BA could inhibit pancreatic CSCs via regulation of AMPK signaling. The proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells was examined by MTT and colony formation assays. The migratory and invasive abilities of pancreatic cancer cells were assessed using wound‑scratch and Transwell invasion assays. In addition, the expression levels of candidate genes were measured by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The results revealed that BA inhibited the proliferation and tumorsphere formation of pancreatic cancer cells, suppressed epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration and invasion, and reduced the expression of three pluripotency factors [SRY‑box 2 (Sox2), octamer‑binding protein 4 (Oct4) and Nanog]. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that there was a significant inverse association between the expression levels of phosphorylated (P)‑AMPK and Sox2 in pancreatic cancer, and it was revealed that BA may activate AMPK signaling. Notably, knockdown of AMPK reversed the suppressive effects of BA on EMT and stemness of pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, BA reversed the effects of gemcitabine on stemness and enhanced the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine. Collectively, these results indicated that BA may effectively inhibit pluripotency factor expression (Sox2, Oct4 and Nanog), EMT and the stem‑like phenotype of pancreatic cancer cells via activating AMPK signaling. Therefore, BA may be considered an attractive therapeutic candidate and an effective inhibitor of the stem‑like phenotype in pancreatic cancer cells.

However, the efficacy of current treatments for breast cancer is limited. In addition to the high risk of recurrence, some of these have side effects that significantly reduce the quality of life. Therefore, new avenues of treatment for breast cancer are needed.  (BA), a pipeline anticancer drug, exerts anti-proliferative effects on breast cancer cells is mainly through inhibition of cyclin and topoisomerase expression, leading to cell cycle arrest. It induces apoptosis through mitochondrial pathway and anti-angiogenesis effect by inhibiting the expression of transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling. In addition, it exerts anti-metastatic effect by inhibiting the expression of matrix metalloproteases. The specific targets of BA in breast cancer are reported to be the estrogen receptor and various multidrug resistance proteins. Synergistically interactions of BA with other chemotherapeutics are also described in the literature. In this review, we describe the detailed published mechanisms of action of BA, a pentacyclic triterpene with a lupine skeleton, on multiple molecular targets to treat breast cancer.

However, the role of BA on MC proliferation and ECM accumulation in diabetic condition remains unclear. So, in the present study, we investigated the role of BA on cell proliferation and ECM accumulation in rat glomerular MCs cultured under high glucose (HG) condition. In the current study, we demonstrated that BA suppressed HG-induced MC proliferation, arrested HG-induced cell-cycle progression, reversed HG-inhibited expression of p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1). It also suppressed HG-induced fibronectin (FN) expression in MCs. Furthermore, BA inhibited HG-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38MAPK in MCs. In conclusion, our present study demonstrated that BA inhibited HG-induced cell proliferation and FN expression in MCs via inhibiting ERK1/2 and p38MAPK .

Recently,  and its derivatives have attracted attention because they showed anti-cancer effects via a ROS- and mitochondria-related mechanism. However, the source of ROS overproduction and the role of mitochondria were poorly identified, and the weak in vivo antitumour activity of these compounds limits their development as drugs.Cytotoxicity was detected using MTT assays. In vivo anti-HCC effects were assessed using nude mice bearing HepG2 tumour xenografts. Cell cycle analysis, apoptosis rate and mitochondrial membrane potential were measured by flow cytometry. ROS production was detected using a microplate reader or a fluorescence microscope. Changes in gene and protein levels were measured by RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Other assays were performed using related detection kits.B5G9, a piperazidine derivative of 23-hydroxy  (23-HBA), showed excellent in vivo anti-HCC effects, with a tumour growth inhibitory rate of greater than 80%, and no significant side effects. B5G9 stimulated the production of ROS, which were derived from the mitochondria, but it had no effect on various other antioxidant systems. Moreover, B5G9 induced mitochondrial dysfunction, which was characterized by morphological changes, membrane potential collapse, membrane permeabilization, and decreases in the O consumption rate and ATP production. Furthermore, mtDNA-depleted ρ0 HepG2 cells were less sensitive to B5G9 treatment than wt HepG2 cells, indicating the importance of mitochondria in B5G9-induced cell death.We discovered a piperazidine derivative of 23-HBA, B5G9, with excellent anti-HCC effects both in vivo and in vitro and no obvious toxic effects. The underlying mechanism was associated with mitochondria-derived ROS overproduction, and mitochondria played essential roles in B5G9-induced cell death.

Rhus chinensis Mill is a Chinese herbal medicine used to treat various types of solid tumors in China. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease group caused by abnormal changes in glucose metabolism resulted in lactic acid production, which remodels acidosis.Although previous studies have shown that the active compounds of Rhus chinensis Mill. can inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, whether its triterpenoids could effectively regulate glycolysis involved in CRC have not been systematically investigated.In this study, the extraction of triterpenoids extract from Rhus chinensis Mill. was obtained, and cell viability assay, the percentage of apoptosis for CRC cells were counted, and matrigel invasion assay and production of lactic acid and glucose uptake assay was determined. we further examined the expression of the key glycolytic enzymes and acid-sending ion channel (ASIC) family members of SW620 cells, and some key proteins in the glycolytic pathway were further verified.Notably, triterpenoids (TER) of Rhus chinensis Mill. showed effective anti-proliferative activity and significantly altered protein levels associated with CRC cell survival and glycolysis metabolism. TER could down-regulate the expression of ASIC2, in CRC SW620 cell line. Most importantly, the levels of ASIC2 and calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) were also down-regulated by TER. Furthermore, inhibition of activated the ASIC2-mediated calcineurin/NFAT1 pathway and target gene transcript expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in parallel to reduce, and resulted in the reduced invasion ability by TER treatment.The potential pathways and targets that involved in glycolysis to excert the anti-CRC effects of main compounds in triterpenoids of Rhus chinensis Mill. were predicted by network pharmacology methods. Our findings thus provided rational evidence that inhibition of the ASIC2-induced calcineurin/NFAT pathway by triterpenoids in Rhus chinensis Mill. profoundly suppressed cell growth and invasion in CRC, which target alternative glycolysis in colorectal tumor cells, may be a useful adjuvant therapy in the treatment of colorectal cancer.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, they are often associated with problems like insoluble in physiological environment and cytotoxicity issue due to impurities and catalyst residues contained in the nanotubes. On the other hand, surface coating agents play an essential role in preventing the nanoparticles from excessive agglomeration as well as providing good water dispersibility by replacing the hydrophobic surfaces of nanoparticles with hydrophilic moieties. Therefore, we have prepared four types of biopolymer-coated single walled carbon nanotubes systems functionalized with anticancer drug,  in the presence of Tween 20, Tween 80, polyethylene glycol and chitosan as a comparative study. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies confirm the bonding of the coating molecules with the SWBA and these results were further supported by Raman spectroscopy. All chemically coated samples were found to release the drug in a slow, sustained and prolonged fashion compared to the uncoated ones, with the best fit to pseudo-second order kinetic model. The cytotoxic effects of the synthesized samples were evaluated in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (3T3) at 24, 48 and 72 h. The in vitro results reveal that the cytotoxicity of the samples were dependent upon the drug release profiles as well as the chemical components of the surface coating agents. In general, the initial burst, drug release pattern and cytotoxicity could be well-controlled by carefully selecting the desired materials to suit different therapeutic applications.</p></html>
