We sequenced HNF1A in 27 patients and GCK in seven subjects with asymptomatic mild fasting hyperglycemia. In addition, we calculated MODY probability with MPC.We identified 11 mutations in 34 patients (32.3%). We found three novel mutations. In the GCK group, six cases had mutations (85.7%), and their MODY probability on MPC was higher than 50%. In the HNF1A group, five of 27 individuals had mutations (18.5%). The MPC was higher than 75% in 11 subjects (including all five cases with HNF1A mutations).Approximately one third of the studied patients have GCK or HNF1A mutations. Inclusion criteria included efficiency in detecting patients with GCK mutations but not for HNF1A mutations (< 20%). MPC was helpful in narrowing the number of candidates for HNF1A screening.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31268904>Metformin improved oxidized low-density lipoprotein-impaired mitochondrial function and increased glucose uptake involving Akt-AS160 pathway in raw264.7 macrophages.</a></h2><p>Macrophage accumulation in the vascular wall is a hallmark of atherosclerosis. Studies showed that shifting of oxidized lipids-induced inflammatory macrophages towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype by promoting oxidative metabolism attenuated atherosclerosis progression. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether metformin, which has ameliorated atherosclerosis in animal models and clinical trials, modulated oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) induced inflammatory status in macrophages by regulating cellular oxidative metabolism.Murine raw264.7 macrophages were incubated with Ox-LDL (50 μg/mL) in the presence or absence of metformin (15 μmol/L) for 24 h. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the transcription of classically activated (M1) pro-inflammatory and alternatively activated () anti-inflammatory markers and mitochondrial DNA copy numbers. Cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial membrane potential were detected by immunofluorescence. Cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, glucose uptake, and lactic acid production were measured by commercial kit and normalized to cellular lysates. Western blotting analysis was performed to detect the expression of mitochondrial fusion/fission related proteins, enzymes mediating lipid metabolism and signaling pathway of glucose transport. Differences between groups were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance.Metformin improved Ox-LDL-impaired anti-inflammatory phenotype in raw264.7 macrophages as shown by up-regulated transcription of anti-inflammatory markers including interleukin 10 (0.76 ± 0.04 vs. 0.94 ± 0.01, P = 0.003) and Resistin-like molecule alpha (0.67 ± 0.08 vs. 1.78 ± 0.34, P = 0.030). Conversely, Ox-LDL-diminished phosphorylation of Akt was up-regulated by metformin treatment (0.47 ± 0.05 vs. 1.02 ± 0.08, P = 0.040), associated with an improvement of mitochondrial function, characterized by decreased ROS generation (2.50 ± 0.07 vs. 2.15 ± 0.04, P = 0.040), increased lipid oxidation, and elevated cellular ATP production (0.026 ± 0.001 vs. 0.035 ± 0.003, P = 0.020). Moreover, metformin-mediated Akt activation increased Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS160) phosphorylation (0.51 ± 0.04 vs. 1.03 ± 0.03, P = 0.0041), promoted membrane translocation of glucose transporter 1, and increased glucose influx into the cells (4.78 ± 0.04 vs. 5.47 ± 0.01, P < 0.001).This study suggested that targeting macrophage metabolism with new or existing drugs had therapeutic potential for the prevention and treatment of -accelerated atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31020913>Modulation of inflammation in wounds of diabetic patients treated with porcine urinary bladder matrix.</a></h2><p> To determine if porcine urinary bladder matrix (UBM) treatment is associated with modulation of wound inflammation in diabetic patients.  mRNA associated with M1 and  macrophages were measured in wounds of diabetic and nondiabetic patients pre- and post-treatment with UBM and an M1: score was calculated.  Wound tissue from diabetic subjects exhibited elevated M1: scores compared with nondiabetic patients, suggesting a greater pro-inflammatory state prior to treatment. Post-treatment, there was significantly greater reduction in the magnitude of the individual M1: scores in the diabetic patients resulting in similar levels in both groups of patients.

Te control group comprised 10 patients of 18-40 age group who died from injuries incompatible with life. Patients with MI were divided into two groups. Group 1 comprised patients who died during the frst 72 hours of MI, group 2 comprised patients who died on days 4‒28. Macrophage infltration in the brain was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis. We used CD68 as a marker for the cells of the macrophage lineage and stabilin-1 as an -like macrophage biomarker.In group 1 the number of brain CD68+ macrophages was signifcantly higher than in the control group. In group 2 the intensity of brain CD68+ cells infltration was lower than in group 1 and higher than in the control group. Tere was a small amount of stabilin-1+ macrophages in the brain of healthy people, as well as of patients who died from MI. Tere were no signifcant diﬀerences in the number of stabilin-1+ cells between group 1 and group 2. Correlation analysis revealed the presence of positive correlation between the number of CD68 + macrophages in the infarct, peri-infarct, and non-infarct areas of the myocardium and the number of CD68+ macrophages in the brain in patients with MI. Tere were not correlations between the number of CD68 + and stabilin-1+ cells and the presence of , history of stroke, history of MI, and pre-infarction angina.Te number of brain CD68+ macrophages signifcantly increased during the frst three days of MI.

However, there is a paucity of data on Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) in this population. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the clinical and polysomnographic (PSG) characteristics of ATSI and non- ATSI adult patients who underwent diagnostic PSG between 2011 and 2015. There were a total of 3078 patients. Of the total, 403 (13%) were of ATSI origin. Amongst those of ATSI origin, 61% were male and 39% females, while amongst the non-ATSI cohort, 66% were males. The median age was 47.8 years in ATSI and 51.5 years in the non- ATSI cohort. In the combined cohort, body mass index was >30 kg/ ( 61%), hypertension (14.4%),  ( 17.8%) and heart disease ( 23.3%). The ATSI patients had higher rates of class III obesity (27 v 15%), hypertension (26 v 14%), cardiac disease (34 v 23%) and  (37 v 17%). Among all the study participants, the PSG confirmed 83.7% of the patients had an apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI) more than 5/hour, mild (AHI 5-15/hour) in (28.4%), moderate (AHI 15-30/hour) in (22.3%), and severe (AHI > 30/hour) in (33.0%). Among the ATSI patients, 46% had severe OSA. The median total AHI value was higher in the ATSI population (25, IQR: 11 - 58) compared to the non-ATSI (17, IQR: 7 - 36), and in rural/remote population (19, IQR: 8 - 42) compared to urban (17, IQR: 7 - 37). This trend was similar for NREM (Non Rapid Eye Movement)-AHI and REM (Rapid Eye Movement) AHI scores, although statistically significant difference was found only with ATSI status. In the combined cohort the probability of (OR= 1.62, 95% CI: 1.32-2.00, p<0.001) of severe OSA was 62% higher in individual with hypertension , however, when stratified by ATSI status, the association was only significant in the non-ATSI population (OR=1.53 95% CI: 1.21 - 1.94, p<0.001). The odds of severe AHI was also significantly associated with heart disease (1.37; 95%CI: 1.14,1.63, p<0.001),  (1.74; 95%CI: 1.43,2.10; p<0.001) and smoking (1.28; 95%CI: 1.09,1.50, p=0.0023) in the overall study cohort. In both ATSI and non- ATSI patients, BMI, neck circumference, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset and respiratory arousal index were significantly higher and independently associated with severe AHI.© Sleep Research Society 2019.

We hypothesized that diet quality is determined by eating behaviors, but evidence in women with obesity is lacking. We evaluated diet quality and eating behavior in 56 women with obesity (mean ± SEM, 36.7 ± 0.7 kg/, 46% White, 50% nulliparous) early in pregnancy (14.9 ± 0.1 weeks). Diet quality was objectively assessed with food photography over six days and defined by Healthy Eating Index. Eating behaviors were assessed by validated questionnaires. Women reported consuming diets high in fat (38 ± 1% of energy) and the HEI was considered "poor" on average (46.7 ± 1.3), and for 71% of women. Diet quality was independently associated with education level ( 0.01), food cravings ( < 0.01), and awareness towards eating ( 0.01). Cravings for sweets and fast foods were positively correlated with respective intakes of these foods ( < 0.01 and  0.04, respectively), whereas cravings for fruits and vegetables did not relate to diet intake. We provide evidence of the determinants of poor diet quality in pregnant women with obesity. Based on this observational study, strategies to improve diet quality and pregnancy outcomes are to satisfy cravings for healthy snacks and foods, and to promote awareness towards eating behaviors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31246958>Mid-upper arm circumference predicts death in adult patients admitted to a TB ward in the Philippines: A prospective cohort study.</a></h2><p>The Philippines is ranked 3rd globally for tuberculosis incidence (554/100,000 population). The tuberculosis ward at San Lazaro Hospital, Manila receives 1,800-2,000 admissions of acutely unwell patients per year with high mortality. Objectives of this prospective cohort study were to quantify the association of under-nutrition (primary) and  (secondary) with inpatient mortality occurring between 3-28 days of hospital admission in patients with suspected or previously diagnosed TB.We enrolled 360 adults (≥18 years); 348 were eligible for the primary analysis (alive on day 3). Clinical, laboratory, anthropometric and enhanced tuberculosis diagnostic data were collected at admission with telephone tracing for mortality up to 6 months post-discharge. In the primary analysis population (mean age 45 years, SD = 15.0 years, 70% male), 58 (16.7%) deaths occurred between day 3-28 of admission; 70 (20.1%) between day 3 and discharge and documented total post-day 3 mortality including follow-up was 96 (27.6%). In those in whom it could be assessed, body mass index (BMI) ranged from 11.2-30.6 kg/ and 141/303 (46.5%) had moderate/severe undernutrition (BMI<17 kg/). A sex-specific cut-off for mid-upper arm circumference predictive of BMI<17 kg/ was associated with inpatient Day 3-28 mortality in males (AOR = 5.04, 95% CI: 1.50-16.86; p = 0.009; p = 0.032 for interaction by sex). The inability to stand for weight/height for BMI assessment was also associated with mortality (AOR = 5.59; 95% CI 2.25-13.89; p<0.001) as was severe compared to normal/mild anaemia (AOR = 9.67; 95% CI 2.48-37.76; p<0.001). No TB specific variables were associated with Day 3-28 mortality, nor was  (HbA1c ≥6.5% or  treatment). Similar effects were observed when the same multivariable model was applied to confirmed TB patients only and to the outcome of all post-day 3 in-patient mortality.This research supports the use of mid-upper arm circumference for triaging acutely unwell patients and the design and testing of nutrition-based interventions to improve patient outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31139852>Targeting gut microbiota and barrier function with prebiotics to alleviate autoimmune manifestations in NOD mice.</a></h2><p>Adopting a diet containing indigestible fibre compounds such as prebiotics to fuel advantageous bacteria has proven beneficial for alleviating inflammation. The effect of the microbial changes on autoimmunity, however, remains unknown. We studied the effects of prebiotic xylooligosaccharides (XOS) on pancreatic islet and salivary gland inflammation in NOD mice and tested whether these were mediated by the gut microbiota.Mother and offspring mice were fed an XOS-supplemented diet until  onset or weaning and were compared with a control-fed group.  incidence was monitored, insulitis and sialadenitis were scored in histological sections from adult mice, and several metabolic and immune variables were analysed in mice before the development of . Gut barrier function was assessed using an in vivo FITC-dextran permeability test. The importance of XOS-mediated gut microbial changes were evaluated in antibiotic-treated mice fed either XOS or control diet or given a faecal microbiota transplant from test animals. onset was delayed in the XOS-fed mice, which also had fewer cellular infiltrations in their pancreatic islets and salivary glands. Interestingly, insulitis was most reduced in the XOS-fed groups when the mice were also treated with an antibiotic cocktail. There was no difference in sialadenitis between the dietary groups treated with antibiotics; the mice were protected by microbiota depletion regardless of diet. Faecal microbiota transplantation was not able to transfer protection. No major differences in glucose-insulin regulation, glucagon-like peptide-1, or short-chain fatty acid production were related to the XOS diet. The XOS diet did, however, reduce gut permeability markers in the small and large intestine. This was accompanied by a more anti-inflammatory environment locally and systemically, dominated by a shift from M1 to  macrophages, a higher abundance of activated regulatory T cells, and lower levels of induction of natural killer T cells and cytotoxic T cells.Prebiotic XOS have microbiota-dependent effects on salivary gland inflammation and microbiota-independent effects on pancreatic islet pathology that are accompanied by an improved gut barrier that seems able to heighten control of intestinal diabetogenic antigens that have the potential to penetrate the mucosa to activate autoreactive immune responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31225583>Total energy expenditure in patients with colorectal cancer: associations with body composition, physical activity, and energy recommendations.</a></h2><p>Total energy expenditure (TEE) data in patients with early-stage cancer are scarce, precluding an understanding of energy requirements.The objective was to cross-sectionally characterize TEE in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and to compare measured TEE with energy recommendations. It was hypothesized that TEE would differ according to body mass, body composition, and physical activity level (PAL) and current energy recommendations would have poor individual-level accuracy.Patients with newly diagnosed CRC had resting energy expenditure (REE) measured by indirect calorimetry and TEE by doubly labeled water. Hypermetabolism was defined as REE > 110% of that predicted from the Mifflin St.-Jeor equation. Body composition was assessed via DXA. Physical activity was determined as the ratio of TEE to REE (TEE:REE) (PAL) and residual activity energy expenditure (RAEE). TEE was compared with energy recommendations of 25-30 kcal/d and Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) using Bland-Altman analyses. Patients were stratified according to median BMI, PAL, and sex-specific ratio of fat mass (FM) to fat-free mass (FFM).Twenty-one patients (M:F 14:7; mean ± SD BMI: 28.3 ± 4.9 kg/, age: 57 ± 12 y) were included. Most (n = 20) had stage II-III disease; 1 had stage IV. Approximately half (n = 11) were hypermetabolic; TEE was not different in those with hypermetabolism and REE as a percentage of predicted was not correlated with TEE. Mean ± SD TEE was 2473 ± 499 kcal/d (range: 1562-3622 kcal/d), or 29.7 ± 6.3 kcal/kg body weight (range: 20.4-48.5 kcal/kg body weight). Mean ± SD PAL was 1.43 ± 0.27. The energy recommendation of 25 kcal/kg underestimated TEE (-12.6% ± 16.5%, P = 0.002); all energy recommendations had wide limits of agreement (the smallest was DRI with measured PAL: -21.2% to 29.3%). Patients with higher BMI and FM:FFM had higher bias using kilocalories per kilogram recommendations; bias from several recommendations was frequently lower (i.e. underestimation) in patients with higher PAL and RAEE.TEE variability was not reflected in energy recommendations and error was related to body weight, body composition, and physical activity.

Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAS) has been recently reported to have cancer-promoting effects. The aim of our study was to observe the effect of OSAS on serum levels of CEA in patients with T2DM. MATERIAL AND METHODS We enrolled 401 T2DM patients in this study. There were 244 patients with OSAS and 157 patients without OSAS. RESULTS The CEA level in T2DM patients with OSAS was higher than that in those without OSAS (p<0.05). The participants with AHI scores ≥30 had higher CEA levels than those with 5≤ AHI scores <30 (p<0.05). The AHI score and ODI score were independently associated with increased risk of high CEA level in T2DM patients (odds ratio [OR]=1.052, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.011~1.095) and (OR=1.214, 95% CI: 1.070~1.377). Moreover, among male T2DM patients, the AHI score and ODI score had a linear correlation with the CEA level; this association was also observed in T2DM patients who smoked, had an HbA1c level ≥7%, or had a BMI ≥28 kg/ (all p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The AHI score and ODI score were positively associated with the CEA level in T2DM patients. The relationship was stronger in male T2DM patients and in those who smoked, were obese, or had poor glycemic control. The mechanism may be related to metabolic disorders, and the potential increased risk of colorectal cancer should be investigated in a prospective study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161219>Intuitive eating is associated with weight loss after bariatric surgery in women.</a></h2><p>Although the data on eating behavior after bariatric surgery are substantial, data on "intuitive eating" are lacking.The aim of this study was to evaluate the link between intuitive eating and weight loss after bariatric surgery.This cross-sectional study used a self-administered questionnaire freely available on social networks and targeted women who had undergone bariatric surgery. Intuitive eating was evaluated with the Intuitive Eating Scale-2 (IES-2). The 3 questionnaire subscores (Eating for Physical Rather than Emotional Reasons, Reliance on Hunger and Satiety Cues, and Unconditional Permission to Eat) were also analyzed. The relation between IES-2 scores and the relative variation in body mass index [BMI (in kg/)] was assessed with linear regression models. Adjusted β (βAdj) and standardized β $( {{\rm{\beta }}_{{\rm{Adj}}}^{{\rm{STD}}}} )$ were reported.We analyzed the responses of 401 women with a mean age of 39 ± 11 y, a mean preoperative BMI of 45.5 ± 7.9, and a mean current BMI of 30.5 ± 7. The mean relative BMI loss was 32.7 ± 12.9%, and the mean IES-2 score was 3.3 ± 0.6. The total IES-2 score was associated with the relative BMI loss, with ∼2.6% BMI loss for each 1-point increase in the IES-2 score [PAdj = 0.007; βAdj = -2.57 (95% CI: -4.44, -0.70); ${\rm{\beta }}_{{\rm{Adj}}}^{{\rm{STD}}}$= -0.12] after adjusting for elapsed time since surgery and type of surgery. Eating for Physical Rather than Emotional Reasons was the subscore most strongly associated with BMI change after adjustment [PAdj = 0.002; βAdj = -2.08 (95% CI: -3.37, 0.79); ${\rm{\beta }}_{{\rm{Adj}}}^{{\rm{STD}}}$ = -0.14].This study highlights a significant association between intuitive eating and BMI decrease after bariatric surgery. Furthermore, eating behaviors changed with increasing time since surgery. An intuitive nutritional approach may be complementary with bariatric surgery in the postoperative phase, which should prompt complementary prospective studies to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic education programs centered on intuitive eating in the postoperative period.© American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31532488>Determinants of change in arterial stiffness over 5 years in early chronic kidney disease.</a></h2><p>Arterial stiffness (AS) is an established and potentially modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). There have been few studies to evaluate the progression of AS over time or factors that contribute to this, particularly in early CKD. We therefore investigated AS over 5 years in an elderly population with CKD Stage 3 cared for in primary care.A total of 1741 persons with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30-59 mL/min/1.73  underwent detailed clinical and biochemical assessment at baseline and Years 1 and 5. Carotid to femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured to assess AS using a Vicorder device.970 participants had PWV assessments at baseline and 5 years. PWV increased significantly by a mean of 1.1 m/s (from 9.7 ± 1.9 to 10.8 ± 2.1 m/s). Multivariable linear regression analysis identified the following independent determinants of ΔPWV at Year 5: baseline age,  status, baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure, baseline PWV, ΔPWV at 1 year, ΔSBP over 5 years and Δserum bicarbonate over 5 years (R2 = 0.38 for the equation).We observed a clinically significant increase in PWV over 5 years in a cohort with early CKD despite reasonably well-controlled hypertension. Measures of BP were identified as the most important modifiable determinant of ΔPWV, suggesting that interventions to prevent arterial disease should focus on improved control of BP, particularly in those who evidence an early increase in PWV. These hypotheses should now be tested in prospective trials.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of ERA-EDTA.

We estimated the effect of BMI on the risk of mortality using a Cox proportional hazards model with BMI as a restricted cubic spline as well as effect modification by adding interaction terms to the spline.During a median of 13.7 years, 876 individuals died. The relationship between baseline BMI and all-cause mortality was reverse J-shaped. When analyses were restricted to those with normal albumin excretion rate, the relationship was U-shaped. The nadir BMI (BMI with the lowest mortality) was in the normal weight region (24.3 to 24.8 kg/); however, among individuals with diabetic nephropathy, the nadir BMI was in the overweight region (25.9 to 26.1 kg/). Diabetic nephropathy, -onset age, and sex modified the relationship between BMI and mortality (Pinteraction < 0.05).Normal weight is optimal for individuals with type 1  to delay mortality, whereas underweight might be an indication of underlying complications. Maintaining normal weight may translate into reduced risk of mortality in type 1 , particularly for individuals of male sex, later -onset age, and normal albumin excretion rate.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515553>Associations of plasma, RBCs, and hair carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios with fish, meat, and sugar-sweetened beverage intake in a 12-wk inpatient feeding study.</a></h2><p>Naturally occurring carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios [13C/12C (CIR) and 15N/14N (NIR)] are promising dietary biomarkers. As these candidate biomarkers have long tissue residence times, long-term feeding studies are needed for their evaluation.Our aim was to evaluate plasma, RBCs, and hair CIR and NIR as biomarkers of fish, meat, and sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake in a 12-wk dietary intervention.Thirty-two men (aged 46.2 ± 10.5 y; BMI: 27.2 ± 4.0 kg/) underwent a 12-wk inpatient dietary intervention at the National Institute of  and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) in Phoenix, Arizona. The effects of fish, meat, and SSB intake on CIR and NIR were evaluated using a balanced factorial design, with each intake factor at 2 levels (present/absent) in a common, background diet (50% carbohydrate, 30% fat, 20% protein). Fasting blood samples were taken biweekly from baseline, and hair samples were collected at baseline and postintervention. Data were analyzed using multivariable regression.The postintervention CIR of plasma was elevated when diets included meat (β = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.73,1.05) and SSBs (β = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.64). The postintervention NIR of plasma was elevated when diets included fish (β = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.64, 1.05) and meat (β = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.42, 0.8). Results were similar for RBCs and hair. Postintervention RBC CIR and NIR had strong associations with baseline, suggesting that turnover to the intervention diets was incomplete after 12 wk. Estimates of isotopic turnover rate further confirmed incomplete turnover of RBCs.CIR was associated with meat and SSBs, and more strongly with meat. NIR was associated with fish and meat, and more strongly with fish. Overall, CIR and NIR discriminated between dietary fish and meat, and to a lesser extent SSBs, indicating their potential utility as biomarkers of intake in US diets.

Matherial and methods. 61 women with left breast cancer without severe cardiovascular pathology were examined at the stage of doxorubicin therapy and 3D conformal radiation therapy. Group 1 comprised 32 patients of middle age (49.8 ± 4.5 years). Group 2 comprised 29 elderly patients (68.3 ± 3.6 years). In addition to Score risk assessment, additional factors, including psychosocial factors, were studied. All patients underwent ECG, echocardiography and 24-hour ECG monitoring. Anxiety levels were assessed using the HADS scale and scale CH. D. Spielberger -Yu.L. Khanin. The study was conducted before the start of treatment, after the completion of the doxorubicin course and after the completion of the course of radiotherapy. Results with discussion. In middle-aged patients, moderate Score risk was found in 21.9%, in the elderly at 58.6% (p = 0.0043, RR 2.68, 95% CI 1.301-5.520). A high Score risk was found in 15.6% of middle-aged patients and 41.4% of elderly patients (p = 0.0438, RR 2.648, 95% CI 1061-6.607). The most common risk factors in the patients studied in addition to age were heredity, overweight, hypercholesterolemia and . All examined patients had moderate reactive anxiety. Patients of middle age have moderate personal anxiety, in elderly patients high personal anxiety. After treatment with doxorubicin in a cumulative dose not exceeding 360 mg/ , a reduction in the ejection fraction below 50% was found in 6 middle-aged patients and 17.2% in elderly patients. Asymptomatic diastolic dysfunction was detected in 31.3% of middle-aged patients and 55.2% of the elderly. In patients of both groups, after arranging treatment, arrhythmia was detected.The obtained data indicate to the need for in-depth examination of middle-aged and especially elderly patients with left breast cancer with an assessment of risk factors and conducting an in-depth examination using Echocardiography, 24-hour ECG monitoring and psychological testing to prevent and early detection of cardiovascular complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315318>Socio-economical and Clinico-Radiological Profile of 474 MDR TB Cases of a Rural Medical College.</a></h2><p>To study the socio economical and clinico radiological profile of 474 diagnosed MDR TB cases who came for the initiation of MDR TB regimen in DRTB center of R.D.Gardi Medical college, Ujjain.This is a retrospective and prospective observational study for a total period of three years from October 2013 to September 2016. The patients were evaluated clinically, radiologically and were investigated thoroughly according to PMDT guidelines and then were started on MDR TB treatment. The study was conducted at drug resistance tuberculosis center (DR-TB) managed by department of Pulmonary Medicine.474 cases were included in the study and we found that patients were in the age range of 10-84 years, maximum patients were in age group of 30 to 39 years, and mean age was 38 yrs. Male to female ratio was 2.73 to 1, most of the patients in the study were from rural area i.e. 61.6%. Illiteracy was found in 339 (71.5%) cases and out of these 339, 165 patients (48.6%) were defaulter, 101(29.8%) are cases of relapse, 39(11.5%) were failure, 34(10.02%) of new cases. Maximum numbers of patient were in lower class accounting 63.7% and upper lower class 31.6%, lower middle class only 4.5%. Study also showed mean BMI was 14.9 kg/ (range 5.7-25.4 kg/), 88.6% of patients were undernourished with BMI less then 18.5kg/ .The most common symptoms was cough seen in 96%, followed by fever 67.5%, Dyspnea 52.7%, Anorexia 26.2%, chest pain in 19.8% and least common was haemoptysis seen in 7.6% of patient. Common co-morbidities with MDR-TB found was anemia in 176 out of 474 (i.e.37.1%), 123(25.9%) COPD. Radiological severity showed 219(46.2%) moderate lesion, 139 (29.3%) mild, 107(22.6%) extensive lesion and 9(1.9%) normal, 312(65.8%) of patient are non-cavitory and 162 (34.2%) are cavitory in which 99 (20.9%) were unilateral and 63(13.3%) are bilateral cavitory lesion. Defaulter are most common accounting of 218(46.0%), relapse139 (29.3%) and failure 68 (14.3%), new 48 (10.2%), most of them had taken more than one episode of ATT (72.8%). Most common source of ATT taken by patient is RNTCP it accounts 424 (89.5%) and 46 (9.7%) from private. 181 out of 474 (38.2%) cases delayed the treatment for 1-7 days, 82 out of 474 (17.3%) cases delayed treatment for 8-10 days, 96 out of 474 (20.3%) cases delayed treatment for 11-19 days and 115 out of 474 delayed the treatment for more than 19 days. 95 out of 474 cases i.e. 20.1% cases come from more than 150 km away from their residing area for the initiation of treatment.The epidemiological picture of TB showed that males were predominant in our study however female were more affected in younger age group compared to male. More than 51% of the cases were in productive age group which affects the socioeconomic condition of family and society. More than 2/3 of patients were from lower socioeconomic group with low BMI. Therefore improving nutrition and immunity can play an important role. 2.3% of the cases were HIV reactive and were on ART. Co-morbidities like COPD and  were seen in our study which were statistically significant and had impact on the treatment outcome of results. Significant delay in initiation of MDR-TB regimen from date of DST was seen in 24.3% cases which is matter of concern. Most of the patients had taken ATT from RNTCP in which Defaulter and relapse was major contributor of MDR-TB suspect in our study and patient taking ATT privately were less.

We aimed to assess maternal and surgical predictors of surgical site skin infection (SSSI) in very severely obese women and to undertake an exploratory evaluation of clinical outcomes in women with a supra-panniculus transverse compared to an infra-panniculus transverse skin incision.Using a retrospective cohort design, case-records were reviewed of very severely obese women with a singleton pregnancy delivered by caesarean between August 2011 and December 2015 (n = 453) in two maternity hospitals in Scotland. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine predictors for SSSI. Outcomes were compared between women who had a supra-panniculus transverse compared to infra-panniculus transverse skin incision.Lower maternal age was predictive of SSSI, with current smoking status and longer wound open times being marginally significant. Maternal BMI, suture method and material demonstrated univariate associations with SSSI but were not independent predictors. Women with a supra-panniculus transverse skin incision were older (32.9 (4.4), vs. 30.6 (5.7), p = 0.002), had higher BMI (49.2 (7.1), vs. 43.3 (3.3), p<0.001), shorter gestation at delivery (days) (267.7 (14.9), vs. 274.8 (14.5), p<0.001) and higher prevalence of gestational  (42.6% vs. 21.9%, p = 0.002).

We have previously demonstrated no differences in the prevalence of clinically active urolithiasis between NPHPT and hypercalcemic asymptomatic PHPT, and that it is significantly higher in postmenopausal osteoporotic women with NPHPT in comparison to women with normal serum PTH and calcium concentrations. Few studies have addressed the occurrence of silent or occult kidney stones in asymptomatic hypercalcemic PHPT, but no data are available for NPHPT.To determine the presence of occult urolithiasis in NPHPT patients using routine abdominal ultrasonography.We studied 35 patients with NPHPT (mean age 63.2 ± 10.7 years, 96% women; serum PTH 116.5 ± 39.2 pg/mL, 25OHD 38.5 ± 6.82 ng/mL, total calcium 9.1 ± 0.56 mg/dL; albumin 4.02 ± 0.37 g/dL; BUN 34.35 ±10.23 mg/dL; p = 3.51 ± 0.60 mg/dL; estimated glomerular filtration rate 88.44 ± 32.45 mL/min/1.73 , and 24-h urinary calcium excretion 140.6 ± 94.3 mg/24 h). The criteria for the diagnosis of NPHPT were as follows: serum PTH above the reference range (11-65 pg/mL), normal albumin-corrected serum calcium concentrations, normal 24-h urinary calcium excretion, serum 25OHD above 30 ng/mL, estimated GFR (MDRD) above 60 mL/min/1.73  (with the exclusion of medications such as thiazide diuretics, lithium, bisphosphonates, and denosumab), a history of clinical symptoms of urolithiasis, and a family history of kidney stones. Thirty-five patients were evaluated and 25 of them met the inclusion criteria. Five patients presented nephrolithiasis corresponding to 20% of the study population. There were no statistically significant differences in any of the clinical or laboratory variables studied between patients with or without urolithiasis, although mean serum PTH levels were higher in patients with stones (180.06 ± 126.48 vs. 100.72 ± 25.28 pg/mL, p = 0.1). The size of the stones ranged from 0.6 to 0.9 cm and all of the stones were located in the renal pelvis.We found a high prevalence of occult kidney stones in NPHPT patients, similar to what is observed in clinically manifested urolithiasis, in hypercalcemic PHPT.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

We also tested in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) whether the interindividual variation in OXT serum levels might be explained by genetic variation.The OXT concentration was increased in subjects with elevated BMI and positively correlated with WHR, waist circumference, and triglyceride levels. The OXT concentration in subjects with BMI <25 kg/ was significantly lower (n = 256; 78.6 pg/mL) than in subjects with a BMI between 25 and 30 kg/ (n = 314; 98.5 pg/mL, P = 6 × 10-6) and with BMI >30 kg/ (n = 137; 106.4 pg/mL, P = 8 × 10-6). OXT levels were also positively correlated with plasma glucose and insulin and were elevated in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (P = 4.6 × 10-3). Heritability of OXT was estimated at 12.8%.

The adverse effect of  is attributed to high levels of inflammation, but the cellular mechanisms responsible remain elusive. In this study, we show that intrinsic skeletal stem cells (SSCs), a subset of mesenchymal stem cells, are essential for resolution of inflammation to occur during osseous healing by using genetic approaches to selectively ablate SSCs. T1D caused aberrant nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation in SSCs and substantially enhanced inflammation in vivo. Constitutive or tamoxifen-induced inhibition of NF-κB in SSCs rescued the impact of  on inflammation, SSC expansion, and tissue formation. In contrast, NF-κB inhibition in chondrocytes failed to reverse the effect of T1D. Mechanistically,  caused defective proresolving macrophage () polarization by reducing TGF-β1 expression by SSCs, which was recovered by NF-κB inhibition or exogenous TGF-β1 treatment. These data identify an underlying mechanism for altered healing in T1D and demonstrate that  induces NF-κB hyperactivation in SSCs to disrupt their ability to modulate  polarization and resolve inflammation.© 2019 by the American  Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554917>A lower duodenal immune response is associated with an increase of insulin resistance in patients with morbid obesity.</a></h2><p>The intestinal immune response could play an important role in obesity-related comorbidities.

Furthermore, we evaluated the potential of these metabolites to act as predictive markers for GDM.This was a prospective study investigating overweight and obese [prepregnancy BMI (in kg/) ≥25 and >30, respectively] pregnant women (prepregnancy median BMI: 28.5; IQR: 26.4-31.5; n = 357). Fasting serum samples were analyzed with a targeted NMR approach in early pregnancy (median: 14.3 weeks of gestation). GDM was diagnosed on the basis of a 2-h, 75-g oral-glucose-tolerance test at a median of 25.7 weeks of gestation.In early pregnancy, 78 lipid metabolites differed in women who later developed GDM (n = 82) compared with those who remained healthy (n = 275) (ANCOVA, adjusted for confounding factors and corrected for multiple comparisons; false discovery rate <0.05). Higher concentrations of several-sized VLDL particles and medium- and small-sized HDL particles, and lower concentrations of very large-sized HDL particles, were detected in women developing GDM. Furthermore, concentrations of amino acids including 2 branched-chain amino acids, isoleucine and leucine, and GlycA, a marker for low-grade inflammation, were higher in women who developed GDM. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the most predictive marker for GDM was a higher concentration of small-sized HDL particles (AUC: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.77; P < 0.001).We identified a distinct early pregnancy metabolomic profile especially attributable to small HDL particles in women developing GDM.

Thus it is not surprising that clinical providers are often overwhelmed with the multitude of symptomatology upon initial presentation in patients with obesity. However, despite a "complicated medical history," a systematic, organized approach in obesity medicine utilizes a personalized-tailored treatment strategy coupled with understanding of the disease state, presence of comorbidities, contraindications, side effects, and patient preferences. Here, we present the case of a young patient with Class 3b severe obesity, several obesity-related complications, and extensive psychological history. Through synergistic and additive treatments (behavioral/nutritional therapy combined with anti-obesity pharmacotherapy and concurrent enrollment in our bariatric surgery program), the patient was able to achieve significant -30.5% total body weight loss with improvement of metabolic parameters. Though these results are not typical of all patients, we must emphasize the need to encompass all available anti-obesity therapies (lifestyle, pharmacotherapy, medical devices, bariatric surgery in monotherapy or combination) in cases of refractory or severe obesity, as we do similarly for other disease modalities such as refractory hypertension or poorly controlled Type 2  that requires robust escalation in therapy.Copyright © 2019 Srivastava and Apovian.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336473>Prevalence of peripheral arterial disease among type 2  in coastal Karnataka.</a></h2><p>Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is one of the leading complications of Type 2  (T2DM).

Pyridoxamine reduced HFD-induced weight gain, attenuated adipocyte size increases, RAGE ligand accumulations, RAGE-RAGE ligands binding, decreased macrophage M1 polarization and increased  polarization in visceral fat tissues, but not in subcutaneous tissues. Pyridoxamine induced glyoxalase 1 (Glo-1) expression in visceral fat in the HFD group, whereas pyridoxamine induced Glo-1 expression in perivascular fat tissues was no higher than that observed in the normal fat diet (NFD) controls. In vitro, pyridoxamine suppressed the release of RAGE ligands from AGE treated macrophages, but non-significantly attenuated RAGE ligands release in AGE treated adipocytes. Pyridoxamine was found to suppress weight increases and M1 polarization, and to increase Glo-1 expression through the RAGE pathway in perivascular and visceral fat tissues of HFD-induced obese rats. These findings suggest pyridoxamine is a candidate for the treatment of obesity or complications related to obesity-induced inflammation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Participants with a hemoglobin A1c level of 7% or greater, , or other chronic diseases were excluded.BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, waist circumference, and cause-specific mortality. Cox regression, adjusted for confounders, yielded mortality hazard ratios (HRs) after at least 5 years of follow-up and before age 75 years.Among 115 400 participants aged 35 to <75 years at recruitment, mean BMI was 28.0 kg/ (SD, 4.1 kg/) in men and 29.6 kg/ (SD, 5.1 kg/) in women. The association of BMI at recruitment with all-cause mortality was J-shaped, with the minimum at 25 to <27.5 kg/. Above 25 kg/, each 5-kg/ increase in BMI was associated with a 30% increase in all-cause mortality (HR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.24 to 1.36]). This association was stronger at ages 40 to <60 years (HR, 1.40 [CI, 1.30 to 1.49]) than at ages 60 to <75 years (HR, 1.24 [CI, 1.17 to 1.31]) but was not materially affected by sex, smoking, or other confounders. The associations of mortality with BMI and waist-to-hip ratio were similarly strong, and each was weakened only slightly by adjustment for the other. Waist circumference was strongly related to mortality and remained so even after adjustment for BMI and hip circumference.Analyses were limited to mortality.General, and particularly abdominal, adiposity were strongly associated with mortality in this Mexican population.Mexican Health Ministry, Mexican National Council of Science and Technology, Wellcome Trust, Medical Research Council, and Kidney Research UK.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31104054>The Amount of Weight Loss Six Months after Bariatric Surgery: It Makes a Difference.</a></h2><p>Bariatric surgery, especially Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), has become the most frequently used therapy for morbid obesity.The aim of this study was to examine the effects of surgically induced weight loss on cardiopulmonary function 6 months after the procedure, as well as the effect of such an intervention on well-known risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.This is a cross-sectional study on 66 morbidly obese patients (BMI ≥40 or ≥35 kg/ with present comorbidities), comparing their cardiopulmonary function prior to and 6 months after RYGB surgery.The substantial amount of weight loss (29.80 ± 13.27 kg) after RYGB surgery was associated with significant reduction of comorbidities, especially  and sedentary lifestyle (p = 0.005 and p = 0.002, respectively). Regarding functional capacity, there was significant increase in peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak, p = 0.003), duration of exercise testing, metabolic equivalents (exercise time and METs, p < 0.001), and in peak O2 pulse. These findings were particularly pronounced in a group of patients who had lost more than 18% of initial weight.Reduction of body weight after RYGB surgery is associated with significantly improved cardiorespiratory function 6 months after surgery, especially in patients who lost more than 18% of their initial body weight. In addition, substantial decreases in body weight were also associated with a reduction of cardiovascular risk factors such as , smoking, hypertriglyceridemia, and sedentary lifestyle.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

We investigated the neurorestorative effects of exosomes derived from mouse brain endothelial cells (EC-Exo) as treatment for stroke in T2DM mice and investigated the role of miR-126 in mediating EC-Exo-derived therapeutic benefits in T2DM-stroke mice. Methods- Adult, male BKS.Cg-m+/+Lepr/J (T2DM) mice were subjected to photothrombotic stroke model. T2DM mice were intravenously injected at 3 days after stroke with (1) PBS; (2) liposome mimic (vehicle control, 3×10); (3) EC-Exo (3×10); (4) knockdown of miR-126 in EC-Exo (miR-126 EC-Exo, 3×10). Behavioral and cognitive tests were performed, and mice were sacrificed at 28 days after stroke. Results- Compared with non-DM stroke mice, T2DM-stroke mice exhibit significantly decreased serum and brain tissue miR-126 expression. Endothelial cells and EC-Exo contain high levels of miR-126 compared with other cell types or exosomes derived from other types of cells, respectively (smooth muscle cells, astrocytes, and marrow stromal cells). Compared with PBS or liposome mimic treatment, EC-Exo treatment of T2DM-stroke mice significantly improves neurological and cognitive function, increases axon density, myelin density, vascular density, arterial diameter, as well as induces  macrophage polarization in the ischemic boundary zone. MiR-126 EC-Exo treatment significantly decreases miR-126 expression in serum and brain, as well as attentuates EC-Exo treatment-induced functional improvement and does not significantly increase axon and myelin density, vascular density, arterial diameter or induce  macrophage polarization in T2DM-stroke mice. In vitro, EC-Exo treatment significantly increases primary cortical neuron axonal outgrowth and increases endothelial capillary tube formation whereas miR-126 EC-Exo attentuates EC-Exo induced capillary tube formation and axonal outgrowth. Conclusions- EC-Exo treatment of stroke promotes neurorestorative effects in T2DM mice. MiR-126 may mediate EC-Exo-induced neurorestorative effects in T2DM mice.

Unresolved inflammation, associated with the dysregulation of both the phenotype and function of macrophages, is involved in the poor healing of diabetic wounds. Here, we report that topical pharmacological inhibition of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) by canrenoate or MR small interfering RNA can resolve inflammation to improve delayed skin wound healing in diabetic mouse models; importantly, wounds from normal mice are unaffected. The beneficial effect of canrenoate is associated with an increased ratio of anti-inflammatory  macrophages to proinflammatory M1 macrophages in diabetic wounds. Furthermore, we show that MR blockade leads to downregulation of the MR target, LCN2, which may facilitate macrophage polarization toward the  phenotype and improve impaired angiogenesis in diabetic wounds. Indeed, diabetic LCN2-deficient mice showed improved wound healing associated with macrophage  polarization and angiogenesis. In addition, recombinant LCN2 protein prevented IL-4-induced macrophage switch from M1 to  phenotype. In conclusion, topical MR blockade accelerates skin wound healing in diabetic mice via LCN2 reduction,  macrophage polarization, prevention of inflammation, and induction of angiogenesis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

O-GlcNAcase (OGA) is an enzyme harboring O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) hydrolase and cryptic lysine acetyltransferase activities. Here, we report that OGA is upregulated in a wide range of human cancers and drives aerobic glycolysis and tumor growth by inhibiting pyruvate kinase  (PKM2). PKM2 is dynamically O-GlcNAcylated in response to changes in glucose availability. Under high glucose conditions, PKM2 is a target of OGA-associated acetyltransferase activity, which facilitates O-GlcNAcylation of PKM2 by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). O-GlcNAcylation inhibits PKM2 catalytic activity and thereby promotes aerobic glycolysis and tumor growth. These studies define a causative role for OGA in tumor progression and reveal PKM2 O-GlcNAcylation as a metabolic rheostat that mediates exquisite control of aerobic glycolysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31059543>Risk factors for incident anemia of chronic diseases: A cohort study.</a></h2><p>Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) refers to hypoproliferative anemia in the context of acute or chronic activation of the immune system. There is a paucity of prospective data addressing the risk factors for ACD development. An association between common chronic diseases and ACD was examined cross-sectionally and longitudinally.A cohort of 265,459 healthy participants without ACD at baseline were prospectively followed annually or biennially.During average follow-up period of 62 months, 4,906 participants developed ACD (incidence rate 3.58 per 1000 person-years). Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] for incident ACD comparing estimated glomerular filtration rate 30-60 and < 30 vs. ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73  were 3.93 [3.18-4.85] and 39.11 [18.50-82.69]; HRs [95% CI] for ACD comparing prediabetes and  vs. normal were 1.19 [1.12-1.27] and 2.46 [2.14-2.84], respectively. HRs [95% CI] for incident ACD comparing body-mass-index (BMI) of < 18.5, 23-24.9 and ≥ 25 vs. 18.5-22.9 kg/ were 0.89 [0.78-1.00], 0.89 [0.80-0.99] and 0.78 [0.66-0.91], respectively.

Unfortunately, existing programs have had limited long-term success of lessening insulin resistance, the key physiological risk indicator for T2D. Underlying psychosocial factors, particularly depressive symptoms, have been related to insulin resistance, independent of BMI or body fat. Preliminary evidence indicates that mindfulness-based programs show promise for intervening with depression and T2D; yet, this approach is novel and data in adolescents are scarce.The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the benefits, and potential underlying mechanisms, of a mindfulness-based intervention in adolescents at-risk for T2D with depressive symptoms and (2) to consider clinical implementation with this specific, psychologically, and medically at-risk adolescent population.The research team conducted a case study report. The setting was an outpatient therapy clinic and research laboratory at a university.The participant was a 16-y-old female with elevated depressive symptoms, obesity, and insulin resistance, and a family history of T2D.The intervention was a 6-wk mindfulness-based group program. The key outcomes were patterns of change in trait mindfulness, depression, and insulin resistance in the course of a 1-y follow-up. Secondary outcomes were patterns of change in reported-overeating patterns and cortisol awakening response.Compared with her scores at baseline, the participant displayed a pattern of increased trait mindfulness, decreased depressive symptoms, and lessening of insulin resistance immediately following the group program and at 1 y. BMI and body fat were stable. There was a remission in reported-overeating and a pattern of declining cortisol awakening response 1 y later. Participant feedback on the intervention was generally positive but also provided potential modifications to strengthen acceptability and effectiveness.The current case results suggest that teaching mindfulness skills to adolescent girls at risk for T2D with depressive symptoms may offer distinctive advantages for treating depression and T2D risk. Clinical implications for increasing the success of implementing mindfulness-based programs in this population include a focus on promotion of social connectedness within the group, implementation of strategies to increase adherence to home practice activities, and the use of facilitation techniques to promote concrete understanding of abstract mindfulness concepts. Future, adequately powered clinical trial data are required to test therapeutic mechanisms and recommended adaptations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968140>Restricting carbohydrates at breakfast is sufficient to reduce 24-hour exposure to postprandial hyperglycemia and improve glycemic variability.</a></h2><p>The breakfast meal often results in the largest postprandial hyperglycemic excursion in people with type 2 .Our purpose was to investigate whether restricting carbohydrates at breakfast would be a simple and feasible strategy to reduce daily exposure to postprandial hyperglycemia.Adults with physician-diagnosed type 2  [n = 23; mean ± SD age: 59 ± 11 y; glycated hemoglobin: 6.7% ± 0.6%; body mass index (kg/): 31 ± 7] completed two 24-h isocaloric intervention periods in a random order. Participants consumed one of the following breakfasts: 1) a very-low-carbohydrate high-fat breakfast (LCBF; <10% of energy from carbohydrate, 85% of energy from fat, 15% of energy from protein) or 2) a breakfast with dietary guidelines-recommended nutrient profile (GLBF; 55% of energy from carbohydrate, 30% of energy from fat, 15% of energy from protein), with the same lunch and dinner provided. Continuous glucose monitoring was used to assess postprandial glucose responses over 24 h, and visual analog scales were used to assess ratings of hunger and fullness.The LCBF significantly reduced postprandial hyperglycemia after breakfast (P < 0.01) and did not adversely affect glycemia after lunch or dinner. As such, overall postprandial hyperglycemia (24-h incremental area under the glucose curve) and glycemic variability (mean amplitude of glycemic excursions) were reduced with the LCBF (24-h incremental area under the glucose curve: -173 ± 361 mmol/L; P = 0.03; mean amplitude of glycemic excursions: -0.4 ± 0.8 mmol/L · 24 h; P = 0.03) compared with the GLBF. Premeal hunger was lower before dinner with the LCBF than with the GLBF (P-interaction = 0.03).A very-low-carbohydrate high-fat breakfast lowers postbreakfast glucose excursions. The effects of this simple strategy appear to be sufficient to lower overall exposure to postprandial hyperglycemia and improve glycemic variability. Longer-term interventions are warranted.

Aberrant macrophage activation to M1 or  is characterized by a deleterious state of chronic inflammation and loss of positive trophic signals. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is used to treat  due to its beneficial role against insulin resistance. The present study examined the effect of GLP-1 on macrophage activation, which contributed to  polarization and secretion of anti-inflammatory factors. In addition, the present study demonstrated that GLP-1 was able to reduce M1 polarization and inflammatory response by using the murine monocyte/macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and detecting M1/-specific genes. RAW264.7 cells were incubated with GLP-1 in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide or interleukin-4, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and signal transduction and transcriptional activation factor 3 (STAT3) activity was assessed by quantification of phosphorylation expression and macrophage polarization was determined by detecting M1/-specific genes expression. The results demonstrated that GLP-1/GLP-1 receptor attenuated the phosphorylation of JNK and its signal transduction through the cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A signaling pathway, while the phosphorylation of STAT3 increased through following treatment with GLP-1. The present study observed that GLP-1 exerts its beneficial effects on macrophage polarization by modulating the JNK/STAT3 signaling pathway. The present results also suggested that the effects of GLP-1 on endocrine and metabolic diseases are possibly mediated by modulation of signaling pathways, and provide a basis for pharmacologic targeting of macrophage activation and an insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the progression of metabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31242290>Overt Proteinuria, Moderately Reduced eGFR and Their Combination Are Predictive of Severe Diabetic Retinopathy or Diabetic Macular Edema in .</a></h2><p>Since the combined effects of proteinuria and a moderately decreased eGFR on incident severe eye complications in patients with  are still largely unknown, these associations were determined in a large historical cohort of Japanese patients with .We evaluated the effects of overt proteinuria (OP) (dipstick 1+ and over) and/or moderately reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (MG) (baseline eGFR 30.0-54.9 mL/min/1.73 ) on the incidence of treatment-required diabetic eye diseases (TRDED).

Since then, a number of initiatives have attempted to address this imbalance. The aim was to evaluate contemporary data as to whether disparities exist in glycaemic control, monitoring, and prescribing in people with T2D.A T2D cohort was identified from the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre dataset: a nationally representative sample of 164 primary care practices (general practices) across England.  healthcare provision and glucose-lowering medication use between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2016 were studied. Healthcare provision included annual HbA1c, renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]), blood pressure (BP), retinopathy, and neuropathy testing. Variables potentially associated with disparity outcomes were assessed using mixed effects logistic and linear regression, adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES) using the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), and nested using random effects within general practices. Ethnicity was defined using the Office for National Statistics ethnicity categories: White, Mixed, Asian, Black, and Other (including Arab people and other groups not classified elsewhere). From the primary care adult population (n = 1,238,909), we identified a cohort of 84,452 (5.29%) adults with T2D. The mean age of people with T2D in the included cohort at 31 December 2016 was 68.7 ± 12.6 years; 21,656 (43.9%) were female. The mean body mass index was 30.7 ± SD 6.4 kg/. The most deprived groups (IMD quintiles 1 and 2) showed poorer HbA1c than the least deprived (IMD quintile 5). People of Black ethnicity had worse HbA1c than those of White ethnicity. Asian individuals were less likely than White individuals to be prescribed insulin (odds ratio [OR] 0.86, 95% CI 0.79-0.95; p < 0.01), sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58-0.79; p < 0.001), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.31-0.44; p < 0.001).

Individuals in IMD quintile 5 were more likely than those in the other IMD quintiles to have annual testing for HbA1c, BP, eGFR, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Black individuals were less likely than White individuals to have annual testing for HbA1c (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79-0.99; p = 0.04) and retinopathy (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70-0.96; p = 0.011). Asian individuals were more likely than White individuals to have monitoring for HbA1c (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.20; p = 0.023) and eGFR (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.00-1.19; p = 0.048), but less likely for retinopathy (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79-0.97; p = 0.01) and neuropathy (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.97; p = 0.01).

This cross-sectional study was carried out among 368 women aged 20-50 years who randomly selected from health centers across Tehran, Iran. Dietary intake was collected using a reliable and validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The FQS includes vegetables, fruits, whole grains, yogurt, nuts and legumes, coffee, refined grains, desserts and ice cream, sugar-sweetened beverages, red meats, fried food consumed outside the home, processed meats, potato and potato chips. Standard methods were used to assess blood pressure, biochemical and anthropometric measures. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the association between FQS and CVD risk factors.  Participant mean age and body mass index (BMI) were 30.7 ± 6.9 years and 24.3 ± 4.0 kg/, respectively. After taking potential confounders into account, FQS had no significant association with risk of overweight and obesity [Odds ratio (OR): 1.1, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.68, 1.8;  = 0.683],  (OR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.22, 1.74;  = 0.374), metabolic syndrome (OR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.10, 1.32;  = 0.127), hypercholesterolemia (OR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.29, 1.01; = 0.051), or hypertriglyceridemia (OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 0.71, 3.70;  = 0.244).  The results showed that FQS was not significantly associated with CVD risk factors among women. Prospective cohort studies are warranted to confirm our findings.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31342680>Metabolic surgery in South Africa: an initial academic hospital experience.</a></h2><p>In South Africa, 42.0% of adult females and 13.5% of adult males are classified as obese, the highest recorded numbers in Sub-Saharan Africa. Metabolic surgery has been proven to be a safe and effective treatment, yet due to demand on government resources has only been performed to a limited extent in public hospitals. The aim of this study was to describe the safety and efficacy of performing metabolic surgery at a single academic hospital in South Africa.This was a single centre retrospective review of 57 metabolic surgery procedures performed from October 2011 to September 2017 at Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. The primary outcome was safety including mortality and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included effect of surgery on weight and  resolution.A total of 57 patients underwent laparoscopic metabolic surgery, of which 44 (83.0%) were female with a mean age (standard deviation) of 42.8 (8.0) years. Fifty-six patients (98%) underwent Roux-and-Y gastric bypass and one (2%) had a sleeve gastrectomy performed. There were no mortalities and overall morbidity was 14.0%, with 3 (5.3%) classified as major and 5 (8.8%) as minor. The follow-up rate at 1 year was 100%. Mean preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 58.8 kg/, and comorbidities included hypertension (59.6%), Type 2  (42.1%), and dyslipidaemia (36.8%). There were no conversions to open surgery and at one year the mean (95% confidence interval) percentage excess body mass index loss was 50.4% (44.0-56.8%).Metabolic surgery can be performed safely in the public sector in South Africa, with short-term safety and efficacy outcomes comparable to international reports. Larger scale studies are needed to determine long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness.Copyright© Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550752></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31072076>The Association between Obesity Phenotypes and Early Renal Function Decline in Adults without Hypertension, Dyslipidemia, and .</a></h2><p>The prevalence of chronic kidney disease is increasing worldwide. Several studies have suggested that obesity is associated with early renal dysfunction. However, little is known about the relationship between obesity phenotypes and early renal function decline. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the relationship between obesity phenotypes and early renal function decline in adults without hypertension, dyslipidemia, and .We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of clinical and anthropometric data from 1,219 patients who underwent a routine health checkup in 2014. We excluded adults with cardiovascular disease, renal disease, , hypertension, dyslipidemia, or low glomerular filtration rate (<60 mL/min/1.73 ). Renal function was determined according to the estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration creatinine-cystatin C equation.Age, sex, body mass index, waist circumference, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein, and fasting glucose had an association with the estimated glomerular filtration rate. After adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, and alcohol intake, the odds ratios of the metabolically abnormal normal weight and metabolically abnormal obese phenotypes for the presence of low estimated glomerular filtration rates were 1.807 (95% confidence interval, 1.009- 3.236) and 1.834 (95% confidence interval, 1.162-2.895), compared with the metabolically healthy normal weight phenotype. However, the metabolically healthy obese phenotype did not show a significant association with early renal function decline.In this cross-sectional study, we confirmed the association between the metabolically abnormal normal weight and metabolically abnormal obese phenotypes and early kidney function decline in adults without hypertension, dyslipidemia, and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284764>Different monocyte phenotypes result in proresolving macrophages in conjugated linoleic acid-induced attenuated progression and regression of atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>Monocytes/macrophages drive progression and regression of atherosclerosis. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), an anti-inflammatory lipid, mediates atheroprotective effects. We investigated how CLA alters monocyte/macrophage phenotype during attenuated progression and regression of atherosclerosis. Apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE) mice were fed a high-fat (60%) high-cholesterol (1%) diet (HFHCD) for 2 wk, followed by 6-wk 1% CLA 80:20 supplementation to investigate disease progression. Simultaneously, ApoE mice were fed a 12-wk HFHCD with/without CLA for the final 4 wk to investigate regression. Aortic lesions were quantified by  staining. Proteomic analysis, real-time quantitative PCR and flow cytometry were used to interrogate monocyte/macrophage phenotypes. CLA supplementation inhibited atherosclerosis progression coincident with decreased proinflammatory and increased anti-inflammatory macrophages. However, CLA-induced regression was associated with increased proinflammatory monocytes resulting in increased proresolving  bone marrow-derived macrophages, splenic macrophages, and dendritic cells in lesion-draining lymph nodes. Proteomic analysis confirmed regulation of a proinflammatory bone marrow response, which was abolished upon macrophage differentiation. Thus, in attenuation and regression of atherosclerosis, regardless of the monocyte signature, during monocyte to macrophage differentiation, proresolving macrophages prevail, mediating vascular repair. This study provides novel mechanistic insight into the monocyte/macrophage phenotypes in halted atherosclerosis progression and regression of atherosclerosis.-Bruen, R., Curley, S., Kajani, S., Lynch, G., O'Reilly, M.

We aimed to assess the changes in serum Mg concentrations at 12-month follow-up in patients, with and without T2DM, who underwent one anastomosis gastric bypass surgery. Overall, 50 patients (80% female, age 42.2 (12.5) years) with morbid obesity (mean baseline BMI 43.8 (4.3) kg/) were included in the analysis. Half of the included patients had T2DM diagnosed at baseline, and these patients showed lower serum Mg concentration (0.78 (0.07)) vs. 0.83 (0.05) mmol/L;  = 0.006), higher blood glucose levels (129.9 (41.3) vs. 87.6 (8.1) mg/dL;  < 0.001) as well as HbA1c concentrations (6.7 (1.4) vs. 5.3 (0.5)%;  < 0.001). During follow-up, BMI and glucose levels showed a decrease; however, serum Mg levels remained stable. At baseline 42% of patients were found to be Mg deficient, which was reduced to 33% at six months and to 30% at 12 months follow-up. Moreover, patients with T2DM had an odds ratio of 9.5 (95% CI = 3.0-29.7;  < 0.001) for magnesium deficiency when compared to patients without T2DM.

The subjects responded to a self-administered baseline questionnaire in 1992 and to a follow-up questionnaire seeking information about  in 2002. Their mean ± SD body mass index was 22.6 ± 2.6 kg/ (men) and 22.1 ± 2.7 (women). The intakes of total soy foods, fried soy foods, nonfried soy foods, soy protein, and soy isoflavones were estimated through the use of a validated food-frequency questionnaire administered in 1992. Associations between soy intake and the risk of  were evaluated through the use of Cox proportional hazards models incorporating age, education level, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, history of hypertension, use of vitamin supplements, menopausal status, and dietary factors including glycemic load, total energy, total fat, meat, fruit, vegetables, and coffee.During a 10-y follow-up, 438 participants reported physician-diagnosed . Women in the highest tertile of intakes of total soy foods, fried soy foods, nonfried soy foods, soy protein, and soy isoflavone had significantly lower HRs, after controlling for covariates, than those with the lowest intakes.

This study evaluated the predictors of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in individuals without traditional CVRFs.A total of 1250 (52.8 ± 6.5 years, 46.9% male) asymptomatic individuals without CVRFs who underwent coronary computed tomographic angiography for a general health examination were analysed. The following were considered as traditional CVRFs: systolic/diastolic blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg; fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL; total cholesterol ≥240 mg/dL; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥160 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol <40 mg/dL; body mass index ≥25.0 kg/; current smoking status; and previous medical history of hypertension, , and dyslipidaemia. Subclinical atherosclerosis, defined as the presence of any coronary plaque, was present in 20.6% cases; the incidences of non-calcified, calcified, and mixed plaque were 9.6%, 12.6%, and 2.6%, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis showed that LDL-C level [odds ratio (OR): 1.008; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.001-1.015], together with age (OR: 1.101; 95% CI: 1.075-1.128) and male sex (OR: 5.574; 95% CI: 3.310-9.388), was associated with the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis (All P < 0.05). LDL-C level was significantly associated with an increased risk of calcified plaques rather than non-calcified or mixed plaques.LDL-C, even at levels currently considered within normal range, is independently associated with the presence of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in individuals without traditional CVRFs. Our results suggest that a stricter control of LDL-C levels may be necessary for primary prevention in individuals who are conventionally considered healthy.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Fourteen subjects with type 2  (aged 49·5 (sd 8·6) years, BMI 29·4 (sd 4·5) kg/, low habitual Ca consumption (<600 mg/d)) were included in this randomised, crossover clinical trial. Subjects participated in two 12-week experimental sessions (high-Ca fat-free milk (HC) or low-Ca control (LC)) separated by 8-week washout. Subjects daily consumed in the laboratory a breakfast shake containing 700 mg (HC) or 6·4 mg (LC) of Ca. Energy-restricted diets containing 800 mg of dietary Ca/d were prescribed. Dietary records data indicated the consumption of 1200 mg of Ca/d during HC and of 525 mg of Ca/d during LC. There was a greater reduction in body weight, body fat mass, waist circumference and waist:hip ratio after HC. Serum 25-hydoxyvitamin D and homeostatic model assessment-2 β-cell function (HOMA2-%B) increased, and serum uric acid, parathormone (PTH) and glycated Hb (HbA1c) concentrations reduced after HC. In addition, changes from baseline in terms of serum uric acid, glucose, HbA1c and PTH concentrations were lower, and those of HOMA2-%B, serum Ca and 25-hydoxyvitamin D were higher after the HC than after LC. The consumption of approximately three servings of fat-free milk and 1200 mg of dietary Ca/d enhanced weight loss, improved body composition and promoted glycaemic control in subjects with type 2  and low habitual Ca consumption (<600 mg/d).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309977>Aerobic and Resistance Exercise Improves Shoulder Function in Women Who Are Overweight or Obese and Have Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>Adverse upper limb musculoskeletal effects occur after surgical procedures and radiotherapy for breast cancer and can interfere with activities of daily living.The objective of this study was to examine the effects of a 16-week exercise intervention on shoulder function in women who are overweight or obese and have breast cancer.This study was a randomized controlled trial.The study was performed at the Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy at the University of Southern California.One hundred women with breast cancer were randomly allocated to exercise or usual-care groups. The mean (SD) age of the women was 53.5 (10.4) years, 55% were Hispanic white, and their mean (SD) body mass index was 33.5 (5.5) kg/.The 16-week exercise intervention consisted of supervised, progressive, moderate to vigorous aerobic and resistance exercise 3 times per week.Shoulder active range of motion, isometric muscular strength, and patient-reported outcome measures (including Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand and the Penn Shoulder Scale) were assessed at baseline, after the intervention, and at the 3-month follow-up (exercise group only). Differences in mean changes for outcomes were evaluated using mixed-model repeated-measures analysis.Compared with the usual-care group, the exercise group experienced significant increases in shoulder active range of motion (the mean between-group differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were as follows: shoulder flexion = 36.6° [95% CI = 55.2-20.7°], external rotation at 0° = 23.4° [95% CI = 31.1-12.5°], and external rotation at 90° = 34.3° [95% CI = 45.9-26.2°]), improved upper extremity isometric strength, and improved Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand and Penn Shoulder Scale scores.Limitations include a lack of masking of assessors after the intervention, an attention control group, and statistical robustness (shoulder function was a secondary end point).A 16-week exercise intervention effectively improved shoulder function following breast cancer treatment in women who were overweight or obese, who were ethnically diverse, and who had breast cancer.© 2019 American Physical Therapy Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31373771>Association between insulin and post-caesarean resuscitation rates in infants of women with GDM: A retrospective study.</a></h2><p>Gestational  (GDM) and caesarean deliveries independently increase the risk of postoperative complications.

We sought to investigate the impact of insulin use in women with GDM on resuscitation rates of infants post caesarean delivery.A retrospective database review of women with singleton term (≥ 37 weeks) pregnancies who were on insulin for GDM delivering between January 2005 and December 2014 at a major metropolitan hospital in Sydney.One thousand eight hundred and fifty-seven women with GDM were identified. The mean age was 31.01 ± 5.63 years and mean gestational period of 39.07 ± 1.00 weeks. 31.0% received insulin treatment for GDM. Women who were on insulin were older (31.9 ± 5.7 vs 30.6 ± 5.6 years, P < 0.001), had a higher body mass index (BMI) (31.2 ± 7.7 vs 29.0 ± 7.4 kg/, P < 0.001), higher rates of preeclampsia (7.3% vs 4.1%, P = 0.004), lower rates of alcohol consumption (0.4% vs 1.7%, P = 0.014), and had infants with lower resuscitation rates (21.2% vs 28.6%, P = 0.001).

Whole-body protein degradation (i.e., the rate of appearance [Ra] of endogenous leucine), leucine disposal to protein synthesis (PS), deamination, and reamination, were determined before and after the HFD, both in the postabsorptive state and following a euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic, hyperaminoacidemic clamp, using isotope dilution methods.After the HFD, mean values (± SEs) for postabsorptive leucine Ra decreased by ∼20%: from 2.52 (0.15) to 2.03 (0.16) μmol x kg-1 x min-1, P < 0.049, after vs. before the HFD respectively. PS also decreased, by ∼25%: from 2.03 (0.15) to 1.57 (0.15), P < 0.045. Leucine concentration (P = 0.1) and reamination (P = 0.095) decreased moderately, whereas deamination was unchanged. Following the clamp, plasma amino acid concentrations (P < 0.001), leucine deamination (+ ∼50%, P < 0.00002), reamination (+ ∼30%, P < 0.0007), and PS (+ ∼35%, P < 0.00001) were all increased compared with postabsorptive state values, whereas endogenous leucine Ra was suppressed (by 15%, P < 0.00001, and by 25%, P < 0.001, with the primary or the reciprocal pool models, respectively). No significant differences in these insulin effects before compared with after the HFD were observed. Metabolic control (glycated hemoglobin), daily insulin requirement, and insulin-mediated glucose disposal were unchanged after the HFD.A HFD downregulates postabsorptive protein turnover in men with T1DM, by decreasing both protein degradation and synthesis, possibly due to a subtle decrease and/or delay in amino acid absorption. It does not significantly affect the insulin (and amino acid sensitivity) to protein turnover, glucose disposal, and metabolic control.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31120971>Assessment of lung function in successfully treated tuberculosis reveals high burden of ventilatory defects and COPD.</a></h2><p>Burden, phenotype and risk-factors of lung function defects in successfully treated tuberculosis cases are unclear.We performed spirometry with bronchodilators in new drug-sensitive adult (≥18 years) pulmonary tuberculosis cases during the 12 months following successful treatment in India. Airflow obstruction was defined as pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC<5th percentile of Global Lung Initiative mixed-ethnicity reference (lower limit of normal [LLN]). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was defined as post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC<LLN among participants with obstruction. Restrictive spirometry pattern was defined as FVC<LLN among participants without obstruction.

The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of different exercise modalities on non-alcoholic fatty liver indices (fatty liver index [FLI], lipid accumulation product [LAP], hepatic steatosis index [HSI], and Framingham Steatosis Index [FSI]) in women with T2D.Fifty-two women with T2D and a mean age of 55.07±5.92 yrs, body mass index (BMI) 28.94±4.09 kg/ , and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 9.41±0.82% were randomized to a sprint interval training (SIT) (n=17), combined aerobic and resistance (A+R) training (n=17), or control group (n=18) for 10 weeks. Two-way repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to find differences between groups and the effects of time and Time×Group interactions after 10 weeks on non-alcoholic fatty liver indices. After this, ANOVA models were constructed to determine the effects of group allocation and change in non-alcoholic fatty liver indices.There were significant time interactions for FLI (P<0.001), HSI (P<0.001), and LAP (P<0.001). Also, there were significant Time×Group interactions for fasting blood glucose (P=0.034), and HbA1c (P=0.006).Results highlight that exercise training, independent of mode of training, is an effective strategy to improve some indices related to hepatic steatosis and blood glucose profiles in women with T2D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31426846>Decitabine assists umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells in improving glucose homeostasis by modulating macrophage polarization in type 2 diabetic mice.</a></h2><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a promising therapy for type 2  (T2D). Mechanistic researches demonstrate that the anti-diabetic effect of MSCs is partially mediated by eliciting macrophages into an anti-inflammatory phenotype thus alleviating insulin resistance. However, single MSC infusion is insufficient to ameliorate sustained hyperglycemia or normalize blood glucose levels. In this study, we used decitabine (DAC), which is involved in the regulation of macrophage polarization, to test whether MSCs combined with decitabine can prolong and enhance the anti-diabetic effect in T2D mice.High-fat diet (HFD) and streptozocin (STZ) were given to induce T2D mouse model. Successfully induced T2D mice were randomly divided into four groups: T2D group, MSC group, DAC group, and MSC + DAC group. Blood glucose was monitored, and glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were evaluated during the entire analysis period. Epididymal fat was extracted for analysis of macrophage phenotype and inflammation in adipose tissue. In vitro, we examined the effect of MSC + DAC on macrophage polarization in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and explore the possible mechanism.MSC infusion effectively improved insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis in T2D mice within 1 week, whereas combination therapy of MSCs + DAC extended the anti-diabetic effects of MSCs from 1 to 4 weeks (the end of the observation). Correspondingly, more  macrophages in adipose tissue were observed in the combination therapy group over the entire study period. In vitro, compared with the MSC group, MSCs combined with decitabine more effectively polarized M1 macrophages to  macrophages. Further analysis showed that the effect of MSC + DAC on macrophage polarization was largely abrogated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) antagonist GW9662.Our data suggest that MSCs combined with decitabine can more effectively alleviate insulin resistance and prolong and enhance the anti-diabetic effect of MSCs in T2D mice in part by prompting  polarization in a PPARγ-dependent manner. Thus, decitabine may be an applicable addition to MSCs for  therapy. UC-MSCs combined with decitabine activate the IL4R/STAT6/STAT3/PPARγ axis to further promote  macrophage polarization in adipose tissue, reduce inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity, and lead to better glucose metabolism and long-term hypoglycemic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536102>Association of Treatment With Metformin vs Sulfonylurea With Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events Among Patients With  and Reduced Kidney Function.</a></h2><p>Before 2016, safety concerns limited metformin use in patients with kidney disease; however, the effectiveness of metformin on clinical outcomes in patients with reduced kidney function remains unknown.To compare major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among patients with  and reduced kidney function who continued treatment with metformin or a sulfonylurea.Retrospective cohort study of US veterans receiving care within the national Veterans Health Administration, with data supplemented by linkage to Medicare, Medicaid, and National Death Index data from 2001 through 2016.

The analyses used propensity score weighting to compare the cause-specific hazard of MACE between treatments and estimate cumulative risk accounting for the competing risks of changing therapy or noncardiovascular death.There were 67 749 metformin and 28 976 sulfonylurea persistent monotherapy users; the weighted cohort included 24 679 metformin and 24 799 sulfonylurea users (median age, 70 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 62.8-77.8]; 48 497 men [98%]; and 40 476 white individuals [82%], with median estimated glomerular filtration rate of 55.8 mL/min/1.73  [IQR, 51.6-58.2] and hemoglobin A1c level of 6.6% [IQR, 6.1%-7.2%] at cohort entry). During follow-up (median, 1.0 year for metformin vs 1.2 years for sulfonylurea), there were 1048 MACE outcomes (23.0 per 1000 person-years) among metformin users and 1394 events (29.2 per 1000 person-years) among sulfonylurea users. The cause-specific adjusted hazard ratio of MACE for metformin was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75-0.86) compared with sulfonylureas, yielding an adjusted rate difference of 5.8 (95% CI, 4.1-7.3) fewer events per 1000 person-years of metformin use compared with sulfonylurea use.Among patients with  and reduced kidney function persisting with monotherapy, treatment with metformin, compared with a sulfonylurea, was associated with a lower risk of MACE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30977832>Identifying Pathogenic Variants of Monogenic  Using Targeted Panel Sequencing in an East Asian Population.</a></h2><p>Monogenic  is a specific type of  in which precision medicine could be applied. In this study, we used targeted panel sequencing to investigate pathogenic variants in Korean patients clinically suspected to have monogenic .The eligibility criteria for inclusion were non-type 1  patients with an age of onset ≤ 30 years and a BMI (body mass index) ≤ 30 kg/. Among the 2,090 non-type 1  patients, 109 were suspected to have monogenic  and subjected to genetic testing. We analyzed 30 monogenic  genes using targeted panel sequencing. The pathogenicity of the genetic variants was evaluated according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines.Among the 109 suspected monogenic  patients, 23 (21.1%) patients harbored pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants. A total of 14 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants of common maturity onset  of the young (MODY) genes were identified in GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A, and HNF1B. Other pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were identified in WFS1, INS, ABCC8 and FOXP3. The mitochondrial DNA 3243 A>G variant was identified in five participants. Patients with pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants had a significantly higher MODY probability, a lower BMI, and a lower C-peptide level than those without pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (P=0.007, P=0.001, and P=0.012, respectively).Using targeted panel sequencing followed by pathogenicity evaluation, we were able to make molecular genetic diagnoses for 23 (21.1%) suspected monogenic  patients. Lower BMI, higher MODY probability, and lower C-peptide levels were characteristics of these participants.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002708>Risk factors for gestational : An umbrella review of meta-analyses of observational studies.</a></h2><p>Gestational  (GDM) is a common pregnancy complication, with complex disease mechanisms, and several risk factors may contribute to its onset. We performed an umbrella review to summarize the evidence from meta-analyses of observational studies on risk factors associated with GDM, evaluate whether there are indications of biases in this literature and identify which of the previously reported associations are supported by convincing evidence.We searched PubMed and ISI Web of Science from inception to December 2018 to identify meta-analyses examining associations between putative risk factors for GDM. For each meta-analysis we estimated the summary effect size, the 95% confidence interval, the 95% prediction interval, the between-study heterogeneity, evidence of small-study effects, and evidence of excess-significance bias.Thirty eligible meta-analyses were identified, providing data on 61 associations. Fifty (82%) associations had nominally statistically significant findings (P<0.05), while only 15 (25%) were significant at P<10-6 under the random-effects model. Only four risk factors presented convincing evidence:, low vs. normal BMI (cohort studies), BMI ~30-35 kg/ vs. normal BMI, BMI >35 kg/ vs. normal BMI, and hypothyroidism.The compilation of results from synthesis of observational studies suggests that increased BMI and hypothyroidism show the strongest consistent evidence for an association with GDM. Diet and lifestyle modifications in pregnancy should be tested in large randomized trials. Our findings suggest that women with known thyroid disease may be offered screening for GDM earlier in pregnancy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31167184>Histological Evidence of Diabetic Kidney Disease Precede Clinical Diagnosis.</a></h2><p>In the absence of a histological diagnosis, persistent albuminuria is globally accepted as the main diagnostic criteria for diabetic kidney disease (DKD).In the present retrospective study, we evaluated data from an Italian cohort of 42 deceased diabetic donors (mainly with type 2 ).

A kidney biopsy was available for 36 patients; of these, one was not interpretable and 32 showed histopathological lesions consistent with DKD and encompassing all histological classes. Thus, we found a relatively high proportion of histologically proven DKD that had been clinically undiagnosed, as none of the patient had significant proteinuria and eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 .The data we present here support the need to implement routine kidney biopsies in normoalbuminuric diabetic subjects in the early stages of CKD.

However, the impact of maternal metformin treatment on the trajectory of fetal, infant, and childhood growth is unknown.PubMed, Ovid Embase, Medline, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane database were systematically searched (from database inception to 26 February 2019). Outcomes of GDM-affected pregnancies randomised to treatment with metformin versus insulin were included (randomised controlled trials and prospective randomised controlled studies) from cohorts including European, American, Asian, Australian, and African women. Studies including pregnant women with pre-existing  or non-diabetic women were excluded, as were trials comparing metformin treatment with oral glucose-lowering agents other than insulin. Two reviewers independently assessed articles for eligibility and risk of bias, and conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer. Outcome measures were parameters of fetal, infant, and childhood growth, including weight, height, BMI, and body composition. In total, 28 studies (n = 3,976 participants) met eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. No studies reported fetal growth parameters; 19 studies (n = 3,723 neonates) reported measures of neonatal growth. Neonates born to metformin-treated mothers had lower birth weights (mean difference -107.7 g, 95% CI -182.3 to -32.7, I2 = 83%, p = 0.005) and lower ponderal indices (mean difference -0.13 kg/m3, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.00, I2 = 0%, p = 0.04) than neonates of insulin-treated mothers. The odds of macrosomia (odds ratio [OR] 0.59, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.77, p < 0.001) and large for gestational age (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.99, p = 0.04) were lower following maternal treatment with metformin compared to insulin. There was no difference in neonatal height or incidence of small for gestational age between groups. Two studies (n = 411 infants) reported measures of infant growth (18-24 months of age). In contrast to the neonatal phase, metformin-exposed infants were significantly heavier than those in the insulin-exposed group (mean difference 440 g, 95% CI 50 to 830, I2 = 4%, p = 0.03). Three studies (n = 520 children) reported mid-childhood growth parameters (5-9 years). In mid-childhood, BMI was significantly higher (mean difference 0.78 kg/, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.33, I2 = 7%, p = 0.005) following metformin exposure than following insulin exposure, although the difference in absolute weights between the groups was not significantly different (p = 0.09). Limited evidence (1 study with data treated as 2 cohorts) suggested that adiposity indices (abdominal [p = 0.02] and visceral [p = 0.03] fat volumes) may be higher in children born to metformin-treated compared to insulin-treated mothers. Study limitations include heterogeneity in metformin dosing, heterogeneity in diagnostic criteria for GDM, and the scarcity of reporting of childhood outcomes.Following intrauterine exposure to metformin for treatment of maternal GDM, neonates are significantly smaller than neonates whose mothers were treated with insulin during pregnancy. Despite lower average birth weight, metformin-exposed children appear to experience accelerated postnatal growth, resulting in heavier infants and higher BMI by mid-childhood compared to children whose mothers were treated with insulin. Such patterns of low birth weight and postnatal catch-up growth have been reported to be associated with adverse long-term cardio-metabolic outcomes. This suggests a need for further studies examining longitudinal perinatal and childhood outcomes following intrauterine metformin exposure.

However, the effect of finerenone on renal and CV outcomes has not been investigated in long-term trials yet.The Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease -(FIDELIO-DKD) trial aims to assess the efficacy and safety of finerenone compared to placebo at reducing clinically important renal and CV outcomes in T2D patients with CKD. FIDELIO-DKD is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, event-driven trial running in 47 countries with an expected duration of approximately 5.5 years. FIDELIO-DKD randomized 5,734 patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥25-<75 mL/min/1.73  and albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥30-≤5,000 mg/g).

Demographic data were collected. BP, weight and height were measured and recorded.Five hundred and sixty six participants (n=566) were enrolled, 91.6% (519) from urban areas, and 72.6% (410) were females. The average age was 53.7 (18-95) years old and body mass index (BMI) was 28.2±6.6 Kg/. The prevalence of hypertension was 47.3% (267/566), without gender or living areas differences (both p>0.1) Prevalence of hypertension was lower in those who self-identified as inter-racial ethnicity, in comparison with Afro-Caribbean (33% vs. 48.3%; p=0.04). About third of the hypertensive patients were not aware of the high BP (89/267; 35.6%). Between hypertensive patients, 64.4% (172/267) were receiving antihypertensive drugs. The rate of BP control was 32% of the hypertensive patients and 50% of those receiving anti-hypertensive medication. Significant lower BP control was observed between diabetic vs. non-diabetic patients (34.3% vs. 60%; p<0.001).We found a high prevalence of HTN in this population, especially in patients with  or previous cardiovascular diseases.

The difference between the estimated and the true aortic BP increases with decreasing estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR). The present study investigated whether aortic calcification affects noninvasive estimates of central BP.Twenty-four patients with CKD stage 4-5 undergoing coronary angiography and an aortic computed tomography scan were included (63% males, age [mean ± SD ] 53 ± 11 years, and eGFR 9 ± 5 mL/min/1.73 ). Invasive aortic BP was measured through the angiography catheter, while non-invasive central BP was obtained using radial artery tonometry with a SphygmoCor® device. The Agatston calcium score (CS) in the aorta was quantified on CT scans using the CS on CT scans.The invasive aortic systolic BP (SBP) was 152 ± 23 mm Hg, while the estimated central SBP was 133 ± 20 mm Hg. Ten patients had a CS of 0 in the aorta, while 14 patients had a CS >0 in the aorta. The estimated central SBP was lower than the invasive aortic SBP in patients with aortic calcification compared to patients without (mean difference 8 mm Hg, 95% CI 0.3-16; p = 0.04). The brachial SBP was lower than the aortic SBP in patients with aortic calcification compared to patients without (mean difference 10 mm Hg, 95% CI 2-19; p = 0.02).In patients with advanced CKD the presence of aortic calcification is associated with a higher difference between invasively measured central aortic BP and non-invasive estimates of central BP as compared to patients without calcifications.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

We compared the risks of maternal, fetal and neonatal complications between patients with GDM and those without GDM.We included 354 patients, 121 (34.3%) had GDM and 63 needed insulin treatment (52.9% of the GDM women). Patients with GDM were older (30.4 ± 5.1 vs 28.9 ± 4.8 years,p = 0.008) and had more frequently a history of GDM (24.8% vs 6.1%; p < 0.0001).

Macrophages are an important component of AT, and are involved in tissue homeostasis, tissue repair and fibrosis. AT-resident macrophages are categorized into two subtypes, the M1-like and -like macrophages. -like macrophages are reported to play anti-inflammatory roles, and to be involved in clearing and removal of dying/dead adipocytes, and recruiting adipocyte progenitors (APs). -like macrophages are also reported to be involved in the promotion of fibrosis in a transforming growth factor-β-dependent manner. However, the precise roles of -like macrophages in the AT have not yet been clearly delineated. Recently, we generated genetically engineered transgenic mice in which CD206 -like macrophages can be conditionally depleted. Unexpectedly, we found that the depletion of CD206 -like macrophages resulted in the enhanced generation of smaller adipocytes, improved insulin sensitivity and proliferation of APs. We further clarified that the CD206 -like macrophages directly interact with the APs to regulate their growth/differentiation and adipogenesis, thereby controlling adiposity and systemic insulin sensitivity. In the present review, we discuss how CD206 -like macrophages provide a niche for APs and maintain glucose homeostasis.© 2019 The Authors.

We sought to determine the association of social support with prevalent chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney function decline in an African American cohort. We also examined whether age modifies the association between social support and kidney function decline.We identified Jackson Heart Study (JHS) participants with baseline (Exam in 2000-2004) functional and structural social support data via the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL) and social network size questions, respectively. With ISEL as our primary exposure variable, we performed multivariable regression models to evaluate the association between social support and prevalent CKD [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73  or urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) ≥30 mg/g], eGFR decline, and rapid renal function decline (RRFD) (> 30% decrease in eGFR over approximately 10 years). All models were adjusted for baseline sociodemographics, , hypertension, smoking status, and body mass index; models for eGFR decline and RRFD were additionally adjusted for eGFR and ACR. In models for eGFR decline, we assessed for interaction between age and social support. For secondary analyses, we replaced ISEL with its individual domains (appraisal, belonging, self-esteem, and tangible) and social network size in separate models as exposure variables.Of 5301 JHS participants, 4015 (76%) completed the ISEL at baseline. 843 (21%) had low functional social support (ISEL score < 32). Participants with low (vs. higher) functional social support were more likely to have lower income (47% vs. 28%), be current or former tobacco users (39% vs. 30%), have  (25% vs. 21%) or CKD (14% vs. 12%). After multivariable adjustment, neither ISEL or social network size were independently associated with prevalent CKD, eGFR decline, or RRFD. Of the ISEL domains, only higher self-esteem was associated with lower odds of prevalent CKD [OR 0.94 (95% CI 0.89-0.99)]. The associations between social support measures and eGFR decline were not modified by age.In this African-American cohort, social support was not associated with prevalent CKD or kidney function decline. Further inquiry of self-esteem's role in CKD self-management and renal outcomes is warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567014>Apolipoprotein AI) Promotes Atherosclerosis Regression in Diabetic Mice by Suppressing Myelopoiesis and Plaque Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Despite robust cholesterol lowering, cardiovascular disease risk remains increased in patients with . Consistent with this,  impairs atherosclerosis regression after cholesterol lowering in humans and mice. In mice, this is attributed in part to hyperglycemia-induced monocytosis, which increases monocyte entry into plaques despite cholesterol lowering. In addition,  skews plaque macrophages toward an atherogenic inflammatory M1 phenotype instead of toward the atherosclerosis-resolving  state typical with cholesterol lowering. Functional high-density lipoprotein (HDL), typically low in patients with , reduces monocyte precursor proliferation in murine bone marrow and has anti-inflammatory effects on human and murine macrophages. Our study aimed to test whether raising functional HDL levels in diabetic mice prevents monocytosis, reduces the quantity and inflammation of plaque macrophages, and enhances atherosclerosis regression after cholesterol lowering.Aortic arches containing plaques developed in  mice were transplanted into either wild-type, diabetic wild-type, or diabetic mice transgenic for human apolipoprotein AI, which have elevated functional HDL. Recipient mice all had low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to promote plaque regression. After 2 weeks, plaques in recipient mouse aortic grafts were examined.Diabetic wild-type mice had impaired atherosclerosis regression, which was normalized by raising HDL levels. This benefit was linked to suppressed hyperglycemia-driven myelopoiesis, monocytosis, and neutrophilia. Increased HDL improved cholesterol efflux from bone marrow progenitors, suppressing their proliferation and monocyte and neutrophil production capacity. In addition to reducing circulating monocytes available for recruitment into plaques, in the diabetic milieu, HDL suppressed the general recruitability of monocytes to inflammatory sites and promoted plaque macrophage polarization to the , atherosclerosis-resolving state.

We investigated an optimal BMI range for osteoporosis and type 2 .This cross-sectional study used data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), 2008 to 2011. We included 3,774 men aged > 50 years and 4,982 postmenopausal women. Logistic regression models were applied to elucidate each BMI category's osteoporosis and  risks.The prevalence of osteoporosis was 9.0% for men and 40.8% for women. The prevalence of type 2  in men was 19.7% and in women was 15.5%. In men with BMI > 25 kg/, the osteoporosis risk did not further increase as BMI increased. In women, BMI was linearly associated with osteoporosis risk without a plateau. In both men and women, higher BMI was associated with a higher type 2  risk. Men with a BMI of 23.0 to 24.9 kg/ harbored about a 30% lower osteoporosis risk than and a similar  risk to those with a BMI of 21.0 to 22.9 kg/. In women with a BMI of 23.0 to 24.9 kg/, the adjusted odds ratio for osteoporosis was 0.72 (95% confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.87); the  risk was not higher than in those with a BMI of 21.0 to 22.9 kg/.For Korean men aged > 50 years and postmenopausal women, a BMI of 23.0 to 24.9 kg/ was the optimal range for minimizing osteoporosis and type 2  risks simultaneously.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664994>Obesity,  and the risk of colorectal adenoma and cancer.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most commonly diagnosed gastrointestinal (GI) malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. In the current case-control study, an association between diagnosis of CRC, obesity and  was investigated.Demographic characteristics, colonoscopy reports, history of drug, smoking, and medical history were collected from patients referred to a colonoscopy unit. The location, size and number of the polyps were recorded during the colonoscopy. Statistically, t-test was conducted for mean comparison for the groups. Pearson's chi-squared test (χ2) was applied to categorize variables. Five classification methods based on the important clinicopathological characteristics such as age, BMI, , family history of colon cancer was performed to predict the results of colonoscopy.Overall, 693 patients participated in this study. In the present study, 115 and 515 patients were evaluated for adenoma/adenocarcinoma and normal colonoscopy, respectively. The mean age of patients positive for adenoma or adenocarcinoma were significantly higher than the negative groups (p value < 0.001). Incidence of overweight and/or obesity (BMI > 25 kg/) were significantly higher in adenoma positive patients as compared to controls (49.9 and 0.9% respectively, p value = 0.04). The results also demonstrated a significant association between suffering from  and having colon adenoma (OR = 1.831, 95%CI = 1.058-3.169, p value = 0.023). The experimental results of 5 classification methods on higher risk factors between colon adenoma and normal colonoscopy data were more than 82% and less than 0.42 for the percentage of classification accuracy and root mean squared error, respectively.In the current study, the occurrence of obesity measured based on BMI and  in the adenoma positive patient group was significantly higher than the control group although there was no notable association between obesity,  and adenocarcinoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474242>Maternal dietary intake of vitamin A during pregnancy was inversely associated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia: the Japan Environment and Children's Study.</a></h2><p>The pathogenesis of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is largely unknown; however, vitamin A seems to play a role in diaphragmatic development. Previous, case-control studies reported that maternal dietary vitamin A intake was inversely associated with the risk of CDH. To our knowledge, however, there is no prospective evidence regarding this association. Our aim was to examine whether maternal intake of vitamin A was associated with CDH occurrence. Baseline data, from the Japan nationwide birth cohort study (2011-2014), on 89,658 mothers (mean age at delivery = 31·2 years) who delivered singleton live births, were analysed. We assessed dietary habits using a food-frequency questionnaire focused on the first trimester, and estimated the daily intakes of total vitamin A (retinol activity equivalents), retinol, provitamin A carotenoids, and vegetables. The occurrence of CDH was ascertained from medical records. A total of 40 cases of CDH were documented. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of CDH occurrence for the high total vitamin A intake category (median = 468 μg/day) was 0·6 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0·3, 1·2) with reference to the low intake category (230 μg/day). When we restricted to mothers with a pre-pregnancy body mass index of 18·5 to 24·9 kg/, vitamin A intake was inversely associated with the risk of their children being born with CDH (OR = 0·5, 95% CI = 0·2, 1·0).

The lanthipeptides are a major subset of RiPPs. Through genome-mining we identified a novel lanthipeptide biosynthetic gene cluster (lah) from Lachnospiraceae bacterium C6A11, an anaerobic bacterium that is a member of the human microbiota and is implicated in the development of host disease states such as type 2  and resistance to Clostridium difficile colonization. The lah cluster encodes at least seven putative precursor peptides and multiple post-translational modification (PTM) enzymes. Two unusual class II lanthipeptide synthetases LahM1/ and a substrate tolerant S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) dependent methyltransferase LahSB are biochemically characterized in this study. We also present the crystal structure of LahSB in complex with product S-adenosylhomocysteine. This study sets the stage for further exploration of the final products of the lah pathway as well as their potential physiological functions in human/animal gut microbiota.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

For weeks 13-26 participants chose to continue with 1-3 VLED d/wk or follow a prescriptive eating plan. Primary outcomes were feasibility and change in BMI expressed as a percentage of the 95th percentile (BMI %95th percentile) at 12 wk. Secondary outcomes were diet acceptability, body composition, cardiometabolic risk, vascular structure and function, quality of life (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory), and eating behaviors [Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ-C)]. Linear mixed models were used to assess change in outcome measures.Of 45 adolescents invited to participate, 30 adolescents (mean ± SD age: 14.5 ± 1.4 y, female n = 25) with a median BMI of 34.9 (range: 27.7-52.4) were recruited. At 12 wk, 23 participants chose to continue with the VLED 2-3 d/wk, and 21 completed the study, indicating the feasibility of IER. Consistent with intention-to-treat analysis, BMI %95th percentile was reduced at 12 wk (difference in estimated marginal means ± SEMs: -5.6 ± 1.1, P < 0.001) and 26 wk (-5.1 ± 1.9, P = 0.013) compared with baseline. Plasma triglycerides were reduced at 26 wk from baseline (-0.33 ± 0.12 mmol/L, P = 0.03). Body fat percentage reduced between 12 and 26 wk (-1.57% ± 0.76%, P = 0.05).

We aimed to examine the effects of physical activity, measured using an accelerometer, and obesity on hypertension onset.At baseline, 426 middle-aged Japanese men who were not on antihypertensive medications were included. Physical activity was measured for 7 consecutive days using an accelerometer. Mean daily moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and step count (SC) were calculated. Low MVPA and low SC were each defined as the first tertile. Obesity was defined as ≥25 kg/ of body mass index. The onset of hypertension was defined as receiving antihypertensive agents during the 4-year follow-up. The combined effects of obesity and physical inactivity on hypertension were examined using Cox regression analysis. Potential confounders included age, smoking, alcohol consumption, daily salt intake, dyslipidemia, , and systolic and diastolic blood pressures.Cox regression analysis revealed that both obesity and low MVPA predicted hypertension in patients, independent of confounders (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.64, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-6.42, p = 0.033), unlike obesity alone (HR: 1.50, 95% CI: 0.50-3.26, p = 0.590). Stratification by obesity and SC revealed similar hypertension risks among the two groups (Obesity with low SC [HR: 2.10, 95% CI 0.88-5.24, p = 0.089]; Obesity without low SC [HR: 1.72, 95% CI 0.93-4.01, p = 0.082]).Here, findings suggest that the coexistence of obesity and decreased MVPA may increase the risk of hypertension onset.Copyright © 2019 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity.

However, there are no data available on reverse remodelling after TAVI assessed by CT. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the predictors and the prognostic value of left ventricular (LV) reverse remodelling following TAVI using CT angiography.We investigated 117 patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent CT scanning before and after TAVI procedure with a mean follow-up time of 2.6 years after TAVI. We found a significant reduction in LV mass (LVM) and LVM indexed to body surface area comparing pre- vs. post-TAVI images: 180.5 ± 53.0 vs. 137.1 ± 44.8 g and 99.7 ± 25.4 vs. 75.4 ± 19.9 g/, respectively, both P < 0.001. Subclinical leaflet thrombosis (SLT) was detected in 25.6% (30/117) patients. More than 20% reduction in LVM was defined as reverse remodelling and was detected in 62.4% (73/117) of the patients. SLT, change in mean pressure gradient on echocardiography and prior myocardial infarction was independently associated with LV reverse remodelling after adjusting for age, gender, and traditional risk factors (hypertension, body mass index, , and hyperlipidaemia): OR = 0.27, P = 0.022 for SLT and OR = 0.22, P = 0.006 for prior myocardial infarction, OR = 1.51, P = 0.004 for 10 mmHg change in mean pressure gradient. Reverse remodelling was independently associated with favourable outcomes (HR = 0.23; P = 0.019).TAVI resulted in a significant LVM regression on CT. The presence of SLT showed an inverse association with LV reverse remodelling and thus it may hinder the beneficial LV structural changes.

Inflammatory processes in T2D are orchestrated by macrophage activation in different organs. Macrophages undergo classical M1 pro-inflammatory or alternative  anti-inflammatory activation in response to tissue microenvironmental signals. These subsets of macrophages are characterised by their expression of cell surface markers, secreted cytokines and chemokines. Transcriptional regulation is central to the polarisation of macrophages, and several major pathways have been described as essential to promote the expression of specific genes, which dictate the functional polarisation of macrophages. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge of transcriptional control of macrophage polarisation and the role this plays in development of insulin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511803>Association of Obesity Indicators with Hypertension in Type 2  Patients.</a></h2><p>To study the association of waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio (WHR) and body mass index (BMI) with hypertension in type 2  (DM) patients in a tertiary care hospital.The anthropometric measures of patients were recorded in the Diabetic Outdoor of Nishtar Hospital Multan from 2013 to 2018 after taking approval from the Institutional Ethical Review Committee.

Epidemiological evidence indicates that consumption of white rice is positively associated with T2D risk, while intake of brown rice is inversely associated. Thus, we explored the effect of substituting brown rice for white rice on T2D risk factors among adults in urban South India. A total of 166 overweight (BMI ≥ 23 kg/) adults aged 25-65 years were enrolled in a randomised cross-over trial in Chennai, India. Interventions were a parboiled brown rice or white rice regimen providing two ad libitum meals/d, 6 d/week for 3 months with a 2-week washout period. Primary outcomes were blood glucose, insulin, glycosylated Hb (HbA1c), insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance) and lipids. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was a secondary outcome. We did not observe significant between-group differences for primary outcomes among all participants. However, a significant reduction in HbA1c was observed in the brown rice group among participants with the metabolic syndrome (-0·18 (se 0·08) %) relative to those without the metabolic syndrome (0·05 (se 0·05) %) (P-for-heterogeneity = 0·02).

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study evaluated YH1 as an add-on medication for poorly controlled type 2 .Forty-six patients with poorly controlled type 2  were randomly assigned 1:1 to the YH1 or placebo group. Before the trial, all subjects had received three or more classes of OHAs with HbA1c > 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and a body mass index ≥ 23 kg/. During the 12-week trial, participants continued to take OHAs without any dose or medication changes. The primary endpoint was the percentage change in HbA1c level. Per-protocol analysis was applied to the final evaluation.At week 12, there was an 11.1% reduction in HbA1c from baseline and a 68.9% increase in homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) of β cell function in the YH1 group, which also exhibited significant reductions in two-hour postprandial glucose (-26.2%), triglycerides (-29.5%), total cholesterol (-21.6%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-17.4%), body weight (-0.5%), and waist circumference (-1.1%). The changes in fasting plasma glucose, HOMA insulin resistance and symptom scores were not significantly different between the YH1 and placebo groups. No serious adverse events occurred during this clinical trial.This pilot study indicates that YH1 together with OHAs can improve hypoglycemic action and β-cell function in overweight/obese patients with poorly controlled type 2 . YH1 is a safe add-on medication for OHAs and has beneficial effects on weight control and lipid metabolism. A larger study population with longer treatment and follow-up periods is required for further verification.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30997492>The effect of high compared with low dairy consumption on glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and metabolic flexibility in overweight adults: a randomized crossover trial.</a></h2><p>Dairy products contain many nutritious components that may benefit metabolic health. There are indications that glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, which are generally disturbed in overweight and obese individuals, may improve by increased dairy intake. This may also affect one's metabolic flexibility.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of high compared with low dairy intake on glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and metabolic flexibility in overweight adults (aged 45-65 y).In this randomized intervention study, subjects consumed a high- and a low-dairy diet [HDD (5-6 dairy portions) and LDD (≤1 dairy portion), respectively] for 6 wk in a crossover design, with a washout period of 4 wk. Dairy portions were 200 g semi-skimmed yoghurt, 30 g reduced-fat (30+) cheese, and 250 mL semiskimmed milk and buttermilk. After 6 wk, a 75-g oral-glucose-tolerance test (13C-labeled) and a subsequent fasting challenge were performed. Metabolic flexibility was studied by determining the respiratory quotient (RQ) using indirect calorimetry. Fasting and postprandial plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin were analyzed. The dual isotope technique enabled calculation of glucose kinetics.The study was completed by 45 overweight men and postmenopausal women [age 58.9 ± 4.3 y, BMI 27.9 ± 1.9 kg/ (mean ± SD)]. Fasting RQ and ΔRQ, reflecting metabolic flexibility, did not differ after both diets. Fasting glucose concentrations were similar, whereas fasting insulin concentrations were lower after the LDD (LDD: 8.1 ± 2.8 mU/L; HDD: 8.9 ± 3.3 mU/L; P = 0.024). This resulted in a higher HOMA-IR after the HDD (P = 0.027). Postprandial glucose and insulin responses as well as glucose kinetics were similar after both diets.The amount of dairy intake during a 6-wk period had a neutral effect on metabolic flexibility or postprandial glucose metabolism in middle-aged overweight subjects. More trials are needed to study the effects of specific dairy types and to differentiate between metabolic subgroups.

Thus, strategies that reprogram inflammatory macrophages may improve the healing of poor wounds, particularly in the aged skin of individuals with  or other chronic diseases. As shown in our previous study, KGM-modified SiO nanoparticles (KSiNPs) effectively activate macrophages to differentiate into the -type phenotype by inducing mannose receptor (MR) clustering on the cell surface. Here, we assess whether KSiNPs accelerate wound healing following acute or chronic skin injury. Using a full-thickness excision model in either diabetic mice or healthy mice, the wounds treated with KSiNPs displayed a dramatically increased closure rate and collagen production, along with decreased inflammation and increased angiogenesis in the regenerating tissues. Furthermore, KSiNPs induced the formation of -like macrophages by clustering MR on the cells. Accordingly, the cytokines produced by the KSiNP-treated macrophages were capable of inducing fibroblast proliferation and subsequent secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM). Based on these results, KSiNPs display great potential as an effective therapeutic approach for cutaneous wounds by effectively suppressing excessive or persistent inflammation and fibrosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to investigate the association between indices of  and the incidence of hypertension and compare the predictive powers of these indices in middle-aged Japanese.This 5-year cohort study included 2210 Japanese aged 30-64 years without hypertension. Hazard ratios of high fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels, high post-loaded BG levels, high glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, insulin resistance (defined by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]) and impaired insulin secretion at baseline for the incidence of hypertension were estimated using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg or receiving antihypertensive treatment.During the follow-up, 456 participants developed hypertension. After adjustment for HbA1c and HOMA-IR, FBG was independently and significantly associated with hypertension. The hazard ratio of participants with FBG ≥7.0 mmol/l was 1.79 compared with those with FBG <5.6 mmol/l. Even among those with HbA1c <6.5%, HOMA-IR <2.5, body mass index <25 kg/, age <55 years old, blood pressure <130/80 mmHg or non- and moderate drinking, the results were similar. High 120-min BG level and impaired insulin secretion did not increase the risk for hypertension.FBG was a predictable index for future incidence of hypertension in middle-aged Japanese men and women.

Although DLW may reveal true physiological differences undetected by respiratory chambers, an alternative possibility is that the expenditure differences resulted from failure to correctly estimate the respiratory quotient (RQ) used in the DLW calculations.To examine energy expenditure differences between isocaloric diets varying widely in carbohydrate and to quantitatively compare DLW data with respiratory chamber and body composition measurements within an energy balance framework.DLW measurements were obtained during the final 2 wk of month-long baseline (BD; 50% carbohydrate, 35% fat, 15% protein) and isocaloric ketogenic diets (KD; 5% carbohydrate, 80% fat, 15% protein) in 17 men with a BMI of 25-35 kg/. Subjects resided 2 d/wk in respiratory chambers to measure energy expenditure (EEchamber). DLW expenditure was calculated using chamber-determined RQ either unadjusted (EEDLW) or adjusted (EEDLWΔRQ) for net energy imbalance using diet-specific coefficients. Accelerometers measured physical activity. Body composition changes were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) which were combined with energy intake measurements to calculate energy expenditure by balance (EEbal).After transitioning from BD to KD, neither EEchamber nor EEbal were significantly changed (∆EEchamber = 24 ± 30 kcal/d; P = 0.43 and ∆EEbal = -141 ± 118 kcal/d; P = 0.25). Similarly, physical activity (-5.1 ± 4.8%; P = 0.3) and exercise efficiency (-1.6 ± 2.4%; P = 0.52) were not significantly changed. However, EEDLW was 209 ± 83 kcal/d higher during the KD (P = 0.023) but was not significantly increased when adjusted for energy balance (EEDLWΔRQ = 139 ± 89 kcal/d; P = 0.14). After removing 2 outliers whose EEDLW were incompatible with other data, EEDLW was marginally increased during the KD by 126 ± 62 kcal/d (P = 0.063) and EEDLW∆RQ was only 46 ± 65 kcal/d higher (P = 0.49).DLW calculations failing to account for diet-specific energy imbalance effects on RQ erroneously suggest that low-carbohydrate diets substantially increase energy expenditure.

Type 2  (T2DM) is a common comorbidity in patients with MO. The aim is to study T2DM remission and to develop a prediction model for T2DM remission after two-stage surgical treatment of patients with MO.Materials and methods: The study included 97 patients with MO. The mean BMI was 68.08 (95% CI: 66.45 - 69.71) kg/. 70 (72,2%) patients with MO were diagnosed with T2DM. The first stage of treatment for the main group (n=60) included the IGB placement, for the control group (n=37) - conservative therapy. In the second stage of treatment the patients underwent bariatric surgery. The study addresses such indicators as BMI, percentage of weight loss, percentage of excess weight loss, ASA physical status class, fasting glucose level, HbA1c, C-peptide.Results: Two-stage treatment of morbidly obese patients with T2DM promotes complete T2DM remission in 68.1% of patients. The risk prediction model for failure to achieve complete T2DM remission 12 months after LRYGB based on a baseline C-peptide level has a high predictive value, AUC = 0.84 (95% CI: 0.69-0.93), OR = 0.23 ( 95% CI: 0.08-0.67).Conclusions: Two-stage treatment of patients with MO promotes improvement of carbohydrate metabolism indicators. With a C-peptide level > 3.7 ng/ml, prediction of complete T2DM remission 12 months after Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass is favorable.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31120372>Symptom Based Clustering of Men in the LURN Observational Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>Conventional classification of patients with lower urinary tract symptoms into diagnostic categories based on a predefined symptom complex or predominant symptom appears inadequate. This is due to the frequent presentation of patients with multiple urinary symptoms which could not be perfectly categorized into traditional diagnostic groups. We used what is to our knowledge a novel clustering method to identify subtypes of male patients with lower urinary tract symptoms based on detailed multisymptom information.We analyzed baseline data on 503 care seeking men in the LURN (Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network) Observational Cohort study. Symptoms and symptom severity were assessed using the LUTS (Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms) Tool and the AUA SI (American Urological Association Symptom Index), which include a total of 52 questions. We used a resampling based, consensus clustering algorithm to identify patient subtypes with distinct symptom signatures.Four distinct symptom clusters were identified. The 166 patients in cluster M1 had predominant symptoms of frequency, nocturia, hesitancy, straining, a weak stream, intermittency and incomplete bladder emptying suggestive of bladder outlet obstruction. The 93 patients in cluster  mainly endorsed post-micturition symptoms (eg post-void dribbling and post-void leakage) with a weak stream in some of them. The 114 patients in cluster M3 reported mostly urinary frequency without incontinence. The 130 patients in cluster M4 reported severe frequency, urgency and urgency incontinence. Most other urinary symptoms statistically differed between cluster pairs. Patient reported outcomes of bowel symptoms, mental health, sleep dysfunction, erectile function and urological pain significantly differed across the clusters.We identified 4 data derived clusters among men seeking care for lower urinary tract symptoms. The clusters differed from traditional diagnostic categories. Further subtype refinement will be done to incorporate clinical data and nonurinary patient reported outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603914>The effectiveness of a community-based, type 2  prevention programme on health-related quality of life. The DE-PLAN study.</a></h2><p>The DE-PLAN was a European multicenter study, with the primary objective of testing whether a community-based lifestyle modification programme could serve as a means of primary prevention for type 2  (T2D) in high-risk individuals (based on the FINDRISC questionnaire). The aim of this study was to examine the impact of a 1-year community-based lifestyle intervention on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in individuals from four participating European centers (Athens, Barcelona, Krakow, Kaunas), through a post-hoc analysis.Each center was allowed to implement different intervention strategies specifically tailored to the needs of their corresponding population sample. Before and after the intervention, participants underwent clinical evaluation, anthropometric measurements, an oral glucose tolerance test and lipid profile measurements. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the validated HRQOL-15D questionnaire. A difference of ±0.015 in the 15D questionnaire score was set as the threshold of clinically meaningful change.Data from 786 participants (67% females, mean age 59.7±9.4 years, BMI 31.5±4.5 kg/) with complete data regarding the HRQOL were analyzed (Athens: 104, Barcelona: 434, Krakow: 175, Kaunas: 70). After 1 year, a significant overall improvement in HRQOL was shown, as depicted by a change of 15D score from baseline value (0.88±0.9) to post-intervention (0.90±0.87, P<0.001), achieving the threshold of clinically meaningful change. A significant weight reduction was also observed (-0.8±4.0 kg, P<0.001). In multivariate analysis, improvement in HRQOL was independently associated with lower 15D score at baseline (P<0.001) and self-reported increase in overall exercise time (P<0.001) as assessed through specifically designed trial questionnaires.A community-based lifestyle intervention programme aiming at T2D prevention, applied on a heterogeneous population and with varied methods, was shown to improve overall health-related quality of life to a clinically meaningful degree.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31382970>Mesenchymal stem cells promote type 2 macrophage polarization to ameliorate the myocardial injury caused by diabetic cardiomyopathy.</a></h2><p>Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a common complication of  and is characterized by chronic myocardial inflammation. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) infusions have recently been suggested to alleviate myocardial injury and ameliorate cardiac function. However, few studies have focused on the effects of MSCs in DCM. Therefore, we explored the effects of MSC-regulated macrophage polarization on myocardial repair in DCM.A DCM rat model was induced by a high-fat diet and streptozotocin (STZ) administration and infused 4 times with MSCs. Rat blood and heart tissue were analyzed for blood glucose levels, lipid levels, echocardiography, histopathology, macrophage phenotype ratios and inflammatory cytokines, respectively. We mimicked chronic inflammation in vitro by inducing peritoneal macrophages with high glucose and LPS, then cocultured these macrophages with MSCs to explore the specific mechanism of MSCs on macrophage polarization.DCM rats exhibited abnormal blood glucose levels and lipid metabolism, cardiac inflammation and dysfunction. MSC infusion ameliorated metabolic abnormalities and preserved cardiac structure and function in DCM rats. Moreover, MSC infusion significantly increased the  phenotype macrophages and alleviated cardiac inflammation. Interestingly, this in vitro study revealed that the MSCs pretreated with a COX-2 inhibitor had little effect on  macrophage polarization, but this phenomenon could be reversed by adding prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).Our results suggested that MSC infusions can protect against cardiac injury in DCM rats. The underlying mechanisms may include MSC-enhanced  macrophage polarization via the COX-2-PGE2 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31166482>Lipid profile and statin use in critical care setting: implications for kidney outcome.</a></h2><p>To determine whether pre-hospital statin use is associated with lower renal replacement therapy requirement and/or death during intensive care unit stay.Prospective cohort analysis.

In 2015, CC was the sixth leading cause of death for women aged 30-59 years in Mexico. Despite the importance of having high-quality and accurate estimates of CC treatment costs that can be used to effectively evaluate the impact of preventive programs, there is scarce information on this topic in Mexico.To estimate the treatment costs by stage diagnosis in patients with CC at a Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) oncology hospital in Mexico City.An observational retrospective study of the resources used to treat 346 women with CC was conducted. Medical charts were reviewed and relevant resource use information was extracted using a data collection instrument that was created based on treatment guidelines. Data were classified into nine cost categories to estimate the total cost per patient.The mean age of patients in the study sample was 54.3 years (range: 41-67), and the average body mass index (BMI) was >26 kg/. Among the participants, 37% were smokers, 39% had , and 56% had hypertension. The medical cost for stages I-IV ranged from $4,738 to $6,058 USD, with an estimated average cost of $5,114 USD.Total treatment costs per patient are high, especially since they were estimated considering only 7.5 months of treatment. This is the first study to estimate the annual cost to treat CC in Mexico and to additionally document the resource pattern use, cost by stage of cancer, and the distribution by cost categories.Creative Commons Attribution License</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30965344>Open-Label Clinical Trials of Oral Pulse Dexamethasone for Adults with Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome.</a></h2><p>In adults with primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), daily prednisone may induce complete remissions (CR) and partial remissions (PR), but relapses are frequent and adverse events are common.We carried out 2 open-label, uncontrolled trials to explore the efficacy and tolerability of pulse oral dexamethasone as an alternative to daily prednisone.

We investigated the association between a high-protein diet, RHF and declining kidney function.A total of 9226 subjects from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study, a community-based prospective study (2001-14), were enrolled and classified into quartiles according to daily amount of protein intake based on food frequency questionnaires. RHF was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with residuals of >95th percentile after adjustment for age, sex, history of hypertension or , height and weight. Rapid decline of renal function was defined as decline rate of eGFR >3 mL/min/1.73 /year.The relative risk of RHF was 3.48-fold higher in the highest than in the lowest protein intake quartile after adjustment for confounding factors [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-8.71]. The mean eGFR decline rate was faster as quartiles of protein intake increased. Furthermore, the highest quartile was associated with 1.32-fold increased risk of rapid eGFR decline (95% CI 1.02-1.73). When subjects were divided into two groups with or without RHF, the highest quartile was associated with a rapid decline in renal function only in RHF subjects (odds ratio 3.35; 95% CI 1.07-10.51). The sensitivity analysis using the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2008-15) data with 40 113 subjects showed that higher quartile was associated with increased risk for RHF.A high-protein diet increases the risk of RHF and a rapid renal function decline in the general population. These findings suggest that a high-protein diet has a deleterious effect on renal function in the general population.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of ERA-EDTA.

Appropriate screening, diagnosis, and management by primary care clinicians are necessary to prevent adverse CKD-associated outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, end-stage kidney disease, and death.Defined as a persistent abnormality in kidney structure or function (eg, glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <60 mL/min/1.73  or albuminuria ≥30 mg per 24 hours) for more than 3 months, CKD affects 8% to 16% of the population worldwide. In developed countries, CKD is most commonly attributed to  and hypertension. However, less than 5% of patients with early CKD report awareness of their disease. Among individuals diagnosed as having CKD, staging and new risk assessment tools that incorporate GFR and albuminuria can help guide treatment, monitoring, and referral strategies. Optimal management of CKD includes cardiovascular risk reduction (eg, statins and blood pressure management), treatment of albuminuria (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers), avoidance of potential nephrotoxins (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and adjustments to drug dosing (eg, many antibiotics and oral hypoglycemic agents). Patients also require monitoring for complications of CKD, such as hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, vitamin D deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and anemia. Those at high risk of CKD progression (eg, estimated GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 , albuminuria ≥300 mg per 24 hours, or rapid decline in estimated GFR) should be promptly referred to a nephrologist.Diagnosis, staging, and appropriate referral of CKD by primary care clinicians are important in reducing the burden of CKD worldwide.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31365522>Identifying important parameters in the inflammatory process with a mathematical model of immune cell influx and macrophage polarization.</a></h2><p>In an inflammatory setting, macrophages can be polarized to an inflammatory M1 phenotype or to an anti-inflammatory  phenotype, as well as existing on a spectrum between these two extremes. Dysfunction of this phenotypic switch can result in a population imbalance that leads to chronic wounds or disease due to unresolved inflammation. Therapeutic interventions that target macrophages have therefore been proposed and implemented in diseases that feature chronic inflammation such as  and atherosclerosis. We have developed a model for the sequential influx of immune cells in the peritoneal cavity in response to a bacterial stimulus that includes macrophage polarization, with the simplifying assumption that macrophages can be classified as M1 or . With this model, we were able to reproduce the expected timing of sequential influx of immune cells and mediators in a general inflammatory setting. We then fit this model to in vivo experimental data obtained from a mouse peritonitis model of inflammation, which is widely used to evaluate endogenous processes in response to an inflammatory stimulus. Model robustness is explored with local structural and practical identifiability of the proposed model a posteriori. Additionally, we perform sensitivity analysis that identifies the population of apoptotic neutrophils as a key driver of the inflammatory process. Finally, we simulate a selection of proposed therapies including points of intervention in the case of delayed neutrophil apoptosis, which our model predicts will result in a sustained inflammatory response.

We aimed to investigate the association between obesity (defined by BMI and abdominal measures) and HF outcomes in Asia.Utilising the Asian Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure (ASIAN-HF) registry (11 Asian regions including Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, India, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Japan, and Korea; 46 centres with enrolment between 1 October 2012 and 6 October 2016), we prospectively examined 5,964 patients with symptomatic HF (mean age 61.3 ± 13.3 years, 26% women, mean BMI 25.3 ± 5.3 kg/, 16% with HF with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF; ejection fraction ≥ 50%]), among whom 2,051 also had waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) measurements (mean age 60.8 ± 12.9 years, 24% women, mean BMI 25.0 ± 5.2 kg/, 7% HFpEF). Patients were categorised by BMI quartiles or WHtR quartiles or 4 combined groups of BMI (low, <24.5 kg/ [lean], or high, ≥24.5 kg/ [obese]) and WHtR (low, <0.55 [thin], or high, ≥0.55 [fat]). Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine a 1-year composite outcome (HF hospitalisation or mortality). Across BMI quartiles, higher BMI was associated with lower risk of the composite outcome (ptrend < 0.001). Contrastingly, higher WHtR was associated with higher risk of the composite outcome. Individuals in the lean-fat group, with low BMI and high WHtR (13.9%), were more likely to be women (35.4%) and to be from low-income countries (47.7%) (predominantly in South/Southeast Asia), and had higher prevalence of  (46%), worse quality of life scores (63.3 ± 24.2), and a higher rate of the composite outcome (51/232; 22%), compared to the other groups (p < 0.05 for all). Following multivariable adjustment, the lean-fat group had higher adjusted risk of the composite outcome (hazard ratio 1.93, 95% CI 1.17-3.18, p = 0.01), compared to the obese-thin group, with high BMI and low WHtR. Results were consistent across both HF subtypes (HFpEF and HF with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF]; pinteraction = 0.355). Selection bias and residual confounding are potential limitations of such multinational observational registries.In this cohort of Asian patients with HF, the 'obesity paradox' is observed only when defined using BMI, with WHtR showing the opposite association with the composite outcome. Lean-fat patients, with high WHtR and low BMI, have the worst outcomes. A direct correlation between high WHtR and the composite outcome is apparent in both HFpEF and HFrEF.Asian Sudden Cardiac Death in HF (ASIAN-HF) Registry ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30972941>Hyperglycemia-Triggered Sphingosine-1-Phosphate and Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor 3 Signaling Worsens Liver Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury by Regulating M1/ Polarization.</a></h2><p>Hyperglycemia aggravates hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), but the underlying mechanism for the aggravation remains elusive. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors (S1PRs) have been implicated in metabolic and inflammatory diseases. Here, we discuss whether and how S1P/S1PRs are involved in hyperglycemia-related liver IRI. For our in vivo experiment, we enrolled diabetic patients with benign hepatic disease who had liver resection, and we used streptozotocin (STZ)-induced hyperglycemic mice or normal mice to establish a liver IRI model. In vitro bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were differentiated in high-glucose (HG; 30 mM) or low-glucose (LG; 5 mM) conditions for 7 days. The expression of S1P/S1PRs was analyzed in the liver and BMDMs. We investigated the functional and molecular mechanisms by which S1P/S1PRs may influence hyperglycemia-related liver IRI. S1P levels were higher in liver tissues from patients with  and mice with STZ-induced . S1PR3, but not S1PR1 or S1PR2, was activated in liver tissues and Kupffer cells under hyperglycemic conditions. The S1PR3 antagonist CAY10444 attenuated hyperglycemia-related liver IRI based on hepatic biochemistry, histology, and inflammatory responses. Diabetic livers expressed higher levels of M1 markers but lower levels of  markers at baseline and after ischemia/reperfusion. Dual-immunofluorescence staining showed that hyperglycemia promoted M1 (CD68/CD86) differentiation and inhibited  (CD68/CD206) differentiation. Importantly, CAY10444 reversed hyperglycemia-modulated M1/ polarization. HG concentrations in vitro also triggered S1P/S1PR3 signaling, promoted M1 polarization, inhibited  polarization, and enhanced inflammatory responses compared with LG concentrations in BMDMs. In contrast, S1PR3 knockdown significantly retrieved hyperglycemia-modulated M1/ polarization and attenuated inflammation. In conclusion, our study reveals that hyperglycemia specifically triggers S1P/S1PR3 signaling and exacerbates liver IRI by facilitating M1 polarization and inhibiting  polarization, which may represent an effective therapeutic strategy for liver IRI in .Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We reviewed the medical records of 374 T2DM patients aged between 20 and 75 years who were prescribed empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg as add-on therapy for more than 90 consecutive days. Changes in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline levels and the reduction in body weights of the study participants were assessed. We found that younger patients (≤ 50 years), patients with the highest levels of HbA1c (>9%) at baseline, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of >90 mL/min/1.73 , and patients with a shorter duration of T2DM (< 10 years) were more likely to exhibit a better glycemic response. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that a shorter duration of T2DM, higher baseline levels of HbA1c, and higher eGFR were positively associated with HbA1c reduction. Higher BMI and lower HbA1c levels were predictors of a more significant reduction in body weight among patients taking empagliflozin. The glucose-lowering effect of empagliflozin was more evident in T2DM patients with higher baseline HbA1c levels, better renal function, and shorter duration of T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31030200>Initiation Condition of Hemodialysis Is Independently Associated with All-Cause Mortality in Maintenance Hemodialysis Patients: A Retrospective Study.</a></h2><p>Despite the progression of dialysis techniques,  the mortality of hemodialysis (HD) patients is still high in China. Here, a retrospective study was performed to investigate the neglected risk factors of all-cause mortality during maintenance HD (MHD).We investigated 117 MHD patients who died between 2011 and 2016 in the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University HD center. In order to analyze the risk factors of 48 months all-cause death, the methods of Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression were used.Multivariate analyses of adjusted age and gender showed that MHD patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate <7 or >10 mL/min/1.73  and anemia (hemoglobin <100 g/L) at the initiation of dialysis are independently associated with the higher death risk. Using central venous catheter vascular access, cerebrovascular comorbidities, , low-flux dialyzer, and dialysis frequency ≤2 times weekly were also the independent risk factors of death within 48 months.This study indicated that the status of HD initiation is a risk factor of long-term survival in MHD patients, which were usually ignored for lacking of nephrology care prior and could potentially be identified and modified to improve the survival prognosis.

Insulin resistance was assessed via the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (primary endpoint) and confirmed by [6-6-2H2]-glucose-labeled, 2-step hyperinsulinemic clamp (n = 20). Clinically relevant cardiometabolic endpoints [including flow-mediated dilatation, augmentation index, lipoprotein status (by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy), and nitric oxide (NO)-related metabolite assay] and anthocyanin metabolism were assessed.A daily intake of 1 cup of blueberries improved endothelial function (flow-mediated dilatation: +1.45%; 95% CI: 0.83%, 2.1%; P = 0.003), systemic arterial stiffness (augmentation index: -2.24%; 95% CI: -3.97%, -0.61%; P = 0.04) and attenuated cyclic guanosine monophosphate concentrations. In statin nonusers (n = 71), elevated high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (+0.08 mmol/L; P = 0.03), high-density lipoprotein particle density (+0.48n, ×10-6; P = 0.002) and apolipoprotein A-I (+0.05 g/L; P = 0.01) concentrations were observed following the 1-cup/d intervention. Treatment compliance was 94.1% (wrapper returns) and total concentrations of anthocyanin-derived phenolic acid metabolites significantly increased, dose-dependently, in serum and 24-h urine (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively). Insulin resistance, pulse wave velocity, blood pressure, NO, and overall plasma thiol status were unaffected. Likewise, a half cup per day had no effect on any biomarkers.Despite insulin resistance remaining unchanged we show, to our knowledge, the first sustained improvements in vascular function, lipid status, and underlying NO bioactivity following 1 cup blueberries/d. With effect sizes predictive of 12-15% reductions in CVD risk, blueberries should be included in dietary strategies to reduce individual and population CVD risk.

Taking into account the ethnic differences, this study aimed to determine the most appropriate cut-off points of anthropometric indices in predicting the incidence of MetS and its components in Ahvaz.This study is part of a cohort study conducted at the  Research Center of Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences on a population of over 20 in Ahvaz during 2009-2014. Of the 592 patients, 505 patients who were not diagnosed with MetS in 2009, were entered into this study. The data analyzed involved demographic information including age and sex, anthropometric information including height, weight, waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC) and the ratios between them, laboratory data including blood levels of Triglyceride (TG), Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and clinical data including systolic(S) and diastolic(D)blood pressure(BP). After 5 years, the subjects were re-evaluated for MetS based on the National Cholesterol Education Program - Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) criteria and the most appropriate cut-off points of anthropometric indices for the prediction of the incidence of MetS using the Receiver Operative Characteristic (ROC) curves were obtained.Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR) index with a cut-off point of 0.53 followed by WC with a cut-off point of 87.5 cm had the highest power to predict the incidence of MetS. The cut-off points of WC and Body mass index (BMI) were respectively 89.5 cm and 26 kg/ for men, and 83.5 cm and 27.5 kg/ for women. All anthropometric indices were able to predict the components of this syndrome (with the exception of low HDL-C). The cut-off point of WC in predicting High FBS, High TG and High BP was 84.5, 84.8, and 86.5 cm, respectively.Overall, it seems that given its ease of measurement, the WC index is preferred to other indices for predicting the incidence of MetS and its components in clinical screening.Copyright © 2019  India.

On separate mornings, 20 healthy nondiabetic men and women (mean age 30 ± 3 y; body mass index 23 ± 0.7 kg/) consumed a glucose beverage or 4 different breads (each 121 g); LAW-R (refined), LAW-W (wholemeal), HAW-R, or HAW-W. The starch contents of the LAW and HAW breads were 24% and 74% amylose, respectively. Venous blood samples were collected at regular intervals before and for 3 h after the breakfast meal to measure plasma glucose, insulin, ghrelin, and incretin hormone concentrations, and the incremental area under the curve (AUC) was calculated (mmol/L × 3 h). Satiety and cravings were also measured at 30-min intervals during the postprandial period.HAW breads had a glycemic response (AUC) that was 39% less than that achieved with conventional wheat breads (HAW 39 ± 5 mmol/L × 3 h; LAW 64 ± 5 mmol/L × 3 h; P < 0.0001). Insulinemic and incretin responses were 24-30% less for HAW breads than for LAW breads (P < 0.05). Processing of the flour (wholemeal or refined) did not affect the glycemic, insulinemic, or incretin response. The HAW breads did not influence plasma ghrelin, or subjective measures of satiety or cravings during the postprandial period.Replacing LAW with HAW flour may be an effective strategy for lowering postprandial glycemic and insulinemic responses to bread in healthy men and women, but further research is warranted.

Whether the beneficial effects extend to those at lower risk remains unclear.We investigated the long-term CV effects of pioglitazone or sulfonylureas (SUs) across the spectrum of pretreatment CV risk.Among 2820 participants of the TOSCA.IT trial, four subgroups with different risk of outcome-a composite of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, urgent coronary revascularization-were identified by the RECursive Partitioning and AMalgamation (RECPAM) method. Within each group, the effect of SUs or pioglitazone on the outcome was evaluated.Sex was the first splitting variable, followed by urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) (>9 mg/g or ≤9 mg/g) and body mass index (BMI) (>28.7 or ≤28.7 kg/). Female patients had the lowest risk (reference); male patients with UACR >9 mg/g and BMI >28.7 kg/ had the highest risk [hazard ratio (HR), 5.58; 95% CI, 3.32 to 9.69]. Patients in this group present a cluster of conditions suggestive of marked insulin resistance (higher BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides, blood pressure, and UACR and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) than the other groups. Treatment with pioglitazone in this group was associated with a significantly lower occurrence of the outcome than SUs (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.76). No significant difference between study treatments was observed in the other RECPAM classes.It is possible to identify patients with type 2  early in the stage of their disease and who are largely free from evident CV disease in whom add-on pioglitazone to metformin confers CV protection as compared with SUs.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31203060>Sellar Xanthogranuloma: A Quest Based on Nine Cases Assessed with an Anterior Pituitary Provocation Test.</a></h2><p>Xanthogranuloma is a chronic inflammatory mass characterized by cholesterol crystal deposition, which is rarely seen in the sellar region.

The chief symptoms were visual symptoms in 3, polyuria in 3, headache in 4, and tiredness in 4 patients. Perimetry found visual field deficit in 6 patients. Anterior pituitary provocation tests disclosed impairment of ≥1 hormone in all patients: growth hormone in 8 patients and adrenocorticotropic hormone-cortisol axis in 8 patients. The lesions were suprasellar in 2 patients, intrasellar in 2 patients, and intrasuprasellar region in 5 patients. Three of the lesions were solid and 6 were single cystic to multicystic. Very low intensity area on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was observed in 4 lesions. Postcontrast study performed in 7 lesions showed enhancement in solid parts or cyst walls. Surgical decompression improved visual disturbance in half of the patients but rarely improved hormonal deficits. Follow-up (median, 47 months) found no recurrence of the lesion.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the long-term effects of SG on T2DM remission with remission seen after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or gastric banding (GB).A literature search was performed in PubMed and Cochrane Library using the following search terms: 'sleeve gastrectomy', '', 'gastric bypass' and 'gastric banding'. Studies published between January 2000 and April 2018, and with following inclusion criteria were selected for this review: BMI ≥ 35 kg/, age ≥ 18 years, follow-up ≥ 1 year, T2DM. Data was statistically analysed using a random-effects model and results were expressed as odds ratio with 95% confidence interval.After exclusion, 35 out of an initial 748 studies, consisting of 18 138 T2DM patients, remained for inclusion. Of these patients, 2480 underwent a SG. The remaining patients underwent a RYGB (n = 10,597) or GB (n = 5061). One year postoperatively, SG patients reached significantly (OR 0.71, p = 0.003) less T2DM remission than RYGB. After stratifying for different criteria for remission, RYGB still tended to result in higher remission rates, but the difference was not statistically significant. Beyond 1 year of follow-up, the difference between RYGB and SG in terms of T2DM remission decreased. SG was superior to the GB (OR 2.17, p = 0.001) after 1 year of follow-up.This review demonstrates important remission of T2DM following SG. Nevertheless, as remission was significantly more often observed following RYGB surgery, the latter procedure remains the gold standard for reaching T2DM remission in patients with concurrent obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980645>Loss of Inverse Association between Framingham Risk Score and Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate in Moderate to Severe Diabetic Kidney Disease.</a></h2><p>We investigated the association of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with Framingham risk score (FRS), and actual cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with type 2  (T2DM). We also assessed improvement in FRS for prediction of CVD after inclusion of eGFR and albuminuria.A total of 571 patients with T2DM and mean age 55 were divided into 2 groups based on the presence of CVD. Participants without CVD were then divided into three groups according to FRS. CVD is defined as an episode of CCU admission, Myocardial infarction, history of coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous intervention. FRS is calculated using the Wilson 1998 Circulation equation, which includes age, sex, high blood pressure, smoking, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), total cholesterol and  as components to assess CVD risk in 10 years.An inverse adjusted association between eGFR and prevalent CVD was confirmed by multiple logistic regression analysis (OR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.74, 0.94, P = 0.03). We observed every 10 mL/min/1.73  decrease in eGFR is related to 3% increase in FRS in patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD) (coefficient = -0.03, P < 0.001). The association between FRS and GFR and also CVD and eGFR were not significant in patients with CKD (P = 0.12; P = 0.17, respectively). Predictive values for FRS components with and without considering eGFR and albuminuria were calculated (0.74 and 0.75, respectively).Inclusion of eGFR and albuminuria in the FRS formula did not improve the predictive value of the model. We showed an inverse association between eGFR and FRS in early stages of diabetic kidney disease, which was lost in patients with CKD.© 2019 The Author(s).

CT subjects have normal-range hormonal profiles and food intake but exhibit resistance to weight gain despite living in the modern world's obesogenic environment.The goal of this study is to identify molecular mechanisms underlying this protective phenotype against weight gain.We conducted a clinical overfeeding study on 30 CT subjects and 30 controls (BMI 20-25 kg/) matched for age and sex. We performed clinical and integrative molecular and transcriptomic analyses on white adipose and muscle tissues.Our results demonstrate that adipocytes were markedly smaller in CT individuals (mean ± SEM: 2174 ± 142 μm 2) compared with controls (3586 ± 216 μ) (P < 0.01). The mitochondrial respiratory capacity was higher in CT adipose tissue, particularly at the level of complex II of the electron transport chain (2.2-fold increase; P < 0.01). This higher activity was paralleled by an increase in mitochondrial number (CT compared with control: 784 ± 27 compared with 675 ± 30 mitochondrial DNA molecules per cell; P < 0.05). No evidence for uncoupled respiration or "browning" of the white adipose tissue was found. In accordance with the mitochondrial differences, CT subjects had a distinct adipose transcriptomic profile [62 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate of 0.1 and log fold change >0.75)], with many differentially expressed genes associating with positive metabolic outcomes. Pathway analyses revealed an increase in fatty acid oxidation ( P = 3 × 10-04) but also triglyceride biosynthesis (P = 3.6 × 10-04). No differential response to the overfeeding was observed in the 2 groups.The distinct molecular signature of the adipose tissue in CT individuals suggests the presence of augm ented futile lipid cycling, rather than mitochondrial uncoupling, as a way to increase energy expenditure in CT individuals. We propose that increased mitochondrial function in adipose tissue is an important mediator in sustaining the low body weight in CT individuals. This knowledge could ultimately allow more targeted approaches for weight management treatment strategies.

However, prior studies included limited cancer deaths and had inconsistent findings. Therefore, we evaluated insulin resistance and cancer-specific and all-cause mortality in postmenopausal women participating in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI).Eligible were a subsample of 22 837 WHI participants aged 50-79 years enrolled at 40 US clinical centers from 1993 to 1998 who had baseline fasting glucose and insulin levels. Baseline insulin resistance was measured by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Cancers were verified by central medical record review and deaths verified by medical record and death certificate review enhanced by National Death Index queries. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. All statistical tests were two-sided.During a median of 18.9 years of follow-up, 1820 cancer deaths and 7415 total deaths occurred. Higher HOMA-IR quartile was associated with higher cancer-specific mortality (Q4 vs Q1, HR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.09 to 1.47; Ptrend = .003) and all-cause mortality (Q4 vs Q1, HR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.51 to 1.76; Ptrend < .001). A sensitivity analysis for  status did not change findings. Among women with body mass index less than 25 kg/, higher HOMA-IR quartile was associated with higher cancer mortality (Fine and Gray, P = .004).High insulin resistance, as measured by HOMA-IR, identifies postmenopausal women at higher risk for cancer-specific and all-cause mortality who could potentially benefit from early intervention.© The Author(s) 2019.

Normal weight women without GDM constituted the reference group.Compared to reference group, overweight or obese women without GDM had an increased risk of macrosomia [odds ratio adjusted for age, parity, smoking and socio-economic status (aOR)1.18 (95% CI 1.09-1.28) and 1.50 (95% CI 1.19-1.88)], and caesarean delivery [aORs 1.17 (95% CI 1.07-1.28) and 1.52 (95% CI 1.37-1.69)], respectively. In normal weight GDM women the risk of macrosomia [aOR 1.17 (95% CI 0.85-1.62)] and caesarean delivery [aOR 1.10 (95% CI 0.96-1.27)] was not significantly increased as compared to normal weight women without GDM. GDM increased the risk of treatment at neonatal ward in all BMI categories and maternal obesity without GDM was also a risk factor for treatment at neonatal ward. Interaction p values between BMI and GDM on these outcomes were <0.001.Maternal overweight and obesity without GDM increased the risk of macrosomia and caesarean delivery when compared to the reference group. These risks were amplified when overweight/obesity was accompanied by GDM. Obesity without GDM was a risk factor for treatment at neonatal ward; GDM increased this risk in all BMI categories. Our results suggest that especially maternal obesity should be considered as a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes and GDM further amplifies this risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31548005>Can Chinese T2D patients with BMI 20-32.5 kg/m benefit from loop duodenojejunal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy?</a></h2><p>Loop duodenojejunal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (LDJB-SG) is a simplified biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch.This study investigated the therapeutic outcomes of LDJB-SG and predictors of type 2  (T2D) remission in Chinese patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 20 to 32.5 kg/m.A university hospital.This retrospective study included 28 T2D patients with a BMI of 20 to 32.5 kg/m who underwent LDJB-SG. T2DM remission, weight loss, postoperative nutrition status, and complications at 1- and 3-year follow-up were assessed. Remission of T2DM was defined as a fasting blood glucose <7 mmol/L and HbA1C <6.5% for 1 year without pharmacological intervention.At 1-year follow-up after LDJB-SG, the T2D remission rate was 75% (21/28), and the mean total weight loss was 23.6%. The 3-year T2D remission rate and percent of total weight loss were 68.4% (13/19) and 20.3%, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that duration of T2D was the only risk factor associated with T2D remission (P < .05). LDJB-SG improved the metabolic syndrome by increasing the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (P = .0157), decreasing waist circumference (P < .0001), and decreasing triglycerides (P = .0053). Postoperative complications of LDJB-SG included malodorous flatus (64.3%), accidental diarrhea induced by greasy food (57.1%), de novo gastroesophageal reflux disease (28.6%), anemia (25%), fatigue (21.4%), underweight (17.9%), intolerance to cooked rice (10.7%), constipation (7.1%), and steatorrhea (3.6%).LDJB-SG resulted in acceptable T2D remission and metabolic improvement at 1- and 3-year follow-up in Chinese T2D patients with a BMI of 20 to 32.5 kg/m. T2D duration may serve as the predictor of T2D remission. LDJB-SG should be performed with caution because of the high incidence of postoperative complications.Copyright © 2019.

Patients afflicted with arrhythmia depend on antiarrhythmic medication or invasive therapy, such as pacemaker implantation. An ideal way to treat these patients would be CCS tissue restoration. This, however, requires precise knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying CCS development. Here, we aimed to identify regulators of CCS development. We performed a compound screen in zebrafish embryos and identified tolterodine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, as a modifier of CCS development. Tolterodine provoked a lower heart rate, pericardiac edema, and arrhythmia. Blockade of muscarinic M3, but not , receptors induced transcriptional changes leading to amplification of sinoatrial cells and loss of atrioventricular identity. Transcriptome data from an engineered human heart muscle model provided additional evidence for the contribution of muscarinic M3 receptors during cardiac progenitor specification and differentiation. Taken together, we found that muscarinic M3 receptors control the CCS already before the heart becomes innervated. Our data indicate that muscarinic receptors maintain a delicate balance between the developing sinoatrial node and the atrioventricular canal, which is probably required to prevent the development of arrhythmia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016375>The role of polyamines in the regulation of macrophage polarization and function.</a></h2><p>Naturally occurring polyamines are ubiquitously distributed and play important roles in cell development, amino acid and protein synthesis, oxidative DNA damage, proliferation, and cellular differentiation. Macrophages are essential in the innate immune response, and contribute to tissue remodeling. Naïve macrophages have two major potential fates: polarization to (1) the classical pro-inflammatory M1 defense response to bacterial pathogens and tumor cells, and (2) the alternatively activated  response, induced in the presence of parasites and wounding, and also implicated in the development of tumor-associated macrophages. ODC, the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis, leads to an increase in putrescine levels, which impairs M1 gene transcription. Additionally, spermidine and spermine can regulate translation of pro-inflammatory mediators in activated macrophages. In this review, we focus on polyamines in macrophage activation patterns in the context of gastrointestinal inflammation and carcinogenesis. We seek to clarify mechanisms of innate immune regulation by polyamine metabolism and potential novel therapeutic targets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968129>Maternal obesity and the human milk metabolome: associations with infant body composition and postnatal weight gain.</a></h2><p>Maternal obesity is a risk factor for childhood obesity; this is a major public health concern given that ∼40% of pregnant women are either overweight or obese. Whether differences in milk composition in lean compared with obese women contribute to childhood obesity is unclear.We aimed to analyze relationships between maternal obesity and human milk metabolites, infant body composition, and postnatal weight gain.This was a prospective study in which mothers intending to breastfeed exclusively, and their newborn infants, were enrolled at delivery (n = 35 mother-infant pairs). We excluded mothers with , other medical conditions, or pregnancy complications. Participants were grouped by maternal prepregnancy BMI <25 (lean) or ≥25 kg/ (overweight/obese). We analyzed infant body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and used untargeted liquid chromatography-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to measure the milk content of 275 metabolites at 1 and 6 mo postpartum.At 1 mo postpartum, 10 metabolites differed between overweight/obese and lean groups with nominal P < 0.05, but none was altered with a false discovery rate <0.25. Many differentially abundant metabolites belonged to the same chemical class; e.g., 4/10 metabolites were nucleotide derivatives, and 3/10 were human milk oligosaccharides. Milk adenine correlated positively with both continuously distributed maternal BMI and with infant adiposity and fat accrual. Analysis of milk composition at 6 mo postpartum revealed 20 differentially abundant metabolites (P < 0.05) in overweight/obese compared with lean women, including 6 metabolites with a false discovery rate of <0.25. At both 1 and 6 mo, human milk abundance of 1,5-anhydroglucitol, which has not previously been described in milk, was positively associated with maternal BMI.Maternal obesity is associated with changes in the human milk metabolome. While only a subset of metabolites correlated with both maternal and infant weight, these point to potential milk-dependent mechanisms for mother-child transmission of obesity.

We aimed to investigate whether a single TXA bolus of 1 g influences the risk of CS in patients who were operated on without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. In 2249 propensity-score-matched pairs who underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting with or without TXA administration, the risk of CS was 0.5% and 0.3% in the TXA and non-TXA groups, respectively (P = 0.36). In the subgroups of patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates <30, 30-60 and >60 ml/min/1.73 , the risk of CS in the TXA group was 2.8%, 1.2% and 0.4%, respectively (P = 0.002), and in the non-TXA group 0.0%, 0.0% and 0.3%, respectively (P = 0.36). The risk of stroke, in-hospital mortality and 30-day mortality did not differ significantly between study groups (P-value >0.05). Our data indicate that in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, a single TXA bolus of 1 g generally does not increase the risk of CS. However, the presence and extent of renal insufficiency have a very significant impact on the incidence of CS even after single-dose TXA.© The Author(s) 2019.

Clinical decision support (CDS) is a health information technology (IT) component that provides useful information to providers as healthcare is being delivered. We hypothesized that CDS incorporated into the electronic health record (EHR) could improve the recognition and management of adrenal crisis within the pediatric ED. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the impact of electronic CDS on the management of patients with known adrenal insufficiency (AI) presenting to two pediatric ED locations over a 19-month period with symptoms suggestive of adrenal crisis. Outcome variables assessed included the frequency of hydrocortisone (HC) administration, appropriateness of HC dosing, and timing to HC order placement and administration. Results A total of 145 encounters were reviewed. When the electronic CDS was in place at the time of the ED visit, patients were nearly 3 times as likely to receive HC (p = 0.002). Among those patients who received HC, the presence of the CDS increased the likelihood of an appropriate 50-mg/ dose of HC being given from 20 to 53% (p = 0.02). However, the CDS did not significantly reduce the time from ED arrival to HC order placement (p = 0.36) or administration (p = 0.59). Conclusions The use of innovative health IT strategies, such as the electronic CDS, can improve the recognition and management of adrenal crisis among patients with AI presenting to the pediatric ED.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399947>Bridging interventions before bariatric surgery in patients with BMI ≥ 50 kg/m: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Bariatric surgery on patients with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 50 kg/m, historically known as superobesity, is technically challenging and carries a higher risk of complications. Bridging interventions have been introduced for weight loss before bariatric surgery in this population. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the efficacy and safety of bridging interventions before bariatric surgery in patients with BMI ≥ 50 kg/m.MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched from database inception to September 2018. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they conducted any bridging intervention for weight loss in patients with BMI greater than 50 kg/m prior to bariatric surgery. Primary outcome was the change in BMI before and after bridging intervention. Secondary outcomes included comorbidity status after bridging interventions and resulting complications. Pooled mean differences (MD) were calculated using random effects meta-analysis.13 studies including 550 patients met inclusion criteria (mean baseline BMI of 61.26 kg/m). Bridging interventions included first-step laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), intragastric balloon (IGB), and liquid low-calorie diet program (LLCD). There was a reduction of BMI by 12.8 kg/m after a bridging intervention (MD 12.8, 95% CI 9.49-16.1, P < 0.0001). Specifically, LSG demonstrated a BMI reduction of 15.2 kg/m (95% CI 12.9-17.5, P < 0.0001) and preoperative LLCD by 9.8 kg/m (95% CI 9.82-15.4, P = 0.0006). IGB did not demonstrate significant weight loss prior to bariatric surgery. There was remission or improvement of type 2 , hypertension, and sleep apnea in 62.8%, 74.6%, and 74.6% of patients, respectively.First-step LSG and LLCD are both safe and appropriate bridging interventions which can allow for effective weight loss prior to bariatric surgery in patients with BMI greater than 50 kg/m.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31269487>Starting Renal Replacement Therapy: Is It About Time?</a></h2><p>Studies of the timing of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have primarily defined "early" versus "late" initiation of dialysis using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)-based criteria. Our objective was to determine the theoretical time that could be spent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 prior to reaching a conservative eGFR threshold of 5 mL/min/1.73  compared to the actual time spent in CKD stage 5 by risk factors of interest.Eight-hundred and seventy Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort participants with CKD stage 5 who started renal replacement therapy (RRT) were included for retrospective study. We used mixed models to estimate the person-specific trajectory of renal function. We then used these individual trajectories to estimate the amount of time that would be spent in CKD stage 5 (between eGFR of 15 and 5 mL/min/1.73 ) and compared this estimate to the actual time spent in CKD stage 5 prior to ESRD (between eGFR of 15 mL/min/1.73  and ESRD).We found the median observed time between eGFR of 15 mL/min/1.73  to RRT was 9.6 months, but the median predicted time between eGFR of 15 mL/min/1.73  to eGFR of 5 mL/min/1.73  was 17.7 months. Some of the largest differences between the predicted and actual amount of time spent in CKD stage 5 were noted among those with systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg (9.7 months longer predicted compared to actual), proteinuria <1 g/g (9.1 months), and serum albumin ≥3.5 g/dL (9.0 months).We found marked differences between the actual and predicted time spent in CKD stage 5 based on risk factors of interest. We believe that placing timing of dialysis initiation in the perspective of time is novel and may identify subgroups of patients who may derive particular benefit from a more concerted effort to delay RRT.© 2019 S.

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a means of determining body composition and body fat distribution at different sites including whole body and trunk-locations where there tends to be high correlation at an individual level.We performed an analysis of DXA-derived metrics of adiposity (truncal fat %,subtotal fat % and total fat %) from the NHANES database and then correlated the findings with markers of insulin resistance. We analyzed the data from DXA scans in NHANES 1999-2004. Homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance and HOMA-β (beta-cell function) were estimated. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated (ρ) between HOMA-IR,HOMA-β and different measures of obesity (Waist circumference(in cm), Body Mass Index (kg/), truncal fat %, subtotal fat % as well as total fat %) to gauge the relationship between markers of glucose homeostasis and DXA derived metrics of obesity. We also performed logarithmic transformation of HOMA-IR as well as HOMA-β to ensure normality of distribution and to meet the criteria for regression analysis. A forward selection model (by outcome and gender) was performed to predict log transformed insulin resistance (log HOMA-IR) as well as log transformed HOMA-β (log HOMA-β,measure of beta cell function) from age, serum triglycerides, HDL, trunk fat % and the SBP (in both males and females separately), after reviewing the spearman correlation coefficients.There were a total of 6147 men and 6369 women who were part of the study cohort. There was a positive correlation between markers of adiposity and log HOMA-IR and log HOMA-β in both males and females.Truncal fat % had the highest nonparametric correlation coefficent with log HOMA-IR among the DXA derived fat% (0.54 in males and 048 in females). In the multivariate analysis, truncal fat % was an independent predictor of logHOMA-IR as well as logHOMA-β. In males, the significant predictors of log HOMA-IR were; age, truncal fat % and HDL cholesterol (Adjusted R square of 0.325 (±0.66), F(3,207) = 34.63, p < .01). In females, the significant predictors of log HOMA-IR were; age, truncal fat %, SBP, Serum triglyceride and HDL cholesterol (Adjusted R square of 0.307 (±0.65),F(5,198) = 18.9, p < .01). In both males and females, the significant predictors of log HOMA-β were; age, and truncal fat % (Males; adjusted R square of 0.25 (±0.63), F (2,208) = 36.4, p < .01, Females; adjusted R square of 0.27 (±0.62), F (2,201) = 38.4, p < .01).Body fat % on DXA is an imaging biomarker for insulin resistance.

Liver-resident macrophages (Kupffer cells, KCs) and oxidative stress play critical roles in the pathogenesis of toxin-induced liver injury. Here, we evaluated the role of oxidative stress in regulating KC polarization against acetaminophen (APAP)-mediated acute liver injury in a streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemic murine model. Compared to the controls, hyperglycemic mice exhibited a significant increase in liver injury and intrahepatic inflammation. KCs obtained from hyperglycemic mice secreted higher levels of the proinflammatory factors, such as TNF-α and IL-6, lower levels of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10. Furthermore, enhanced oxidative stress was revealed by increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in KCs from hyperglycemic mice post APAP treatment. In addition, ROS inhibitor NAC resulted in a significant decrease of ROS production in hyperglycemic KCs from mice posttreated with APAP. We also analyzed the role of hyperglycemia in macrophage M1/ polarization. Interestingly, we found that hyperglycemia promoted M1 polarization, but inhibited  polarization of KCs obtained from APAP-exposed livers, as evidenced by increased MCP-1 and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) gene induction but decreased Arg-1 and CD206 gene induction accompanied by increased STAT1 activation and decreased STAT6 activation. NAC restored Arg-1, CD206 gene induction, and STAT6 activation. To explore the mechanism how hyperglycemia regulates KCs polarization against APAP-induced acute liver injury, we examined the AMPK/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and found decreased AMPK activation and increased AKT activation in liver and KCs from hyperglycemic mice post APAP treatment. AMPK activation by its agonist AICAR or PI3K inhibition by its antagonist LY294002 inhibited ROS production in KCs from hyperglycemic mice post APAP treatment and significantly attenuated APAP-induced liver injury in the hyperglycemic mice, compared to the control mice. Our results demonstrated that hyperglycemia exacerbated APAP-induced acute liver injury by promoting liver-resident macrophage proinflammatory response via AMPK/PI3K/AKT-mediated oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553973></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31208912>Extracellular Vesicles from Albumin-Induced Tubular Epithelial Cells Promote the M1 Macrophage Phenotype by Targeting Klotho.</a></h2><p>Albumin absorbed by renal tubular epithelial cells induces inflammation and plays a key role in promoting diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression.

However, whether albuminuria influences macrophage phenotypes and underlying mechanisms during the development of DKD is still unclear. We found that M1 macrophage-related markers were increased in  (DM) mouse renal tissues with the development of DKD, and coculture of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from human serum albumin (HSA)-induced HK-2 cells with macrophages induced macrophage M1 polarization in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Through a bioinformatic analysis, miR-199a-5p was selected and found to be increased in EVs from HSA-induced HK-2 cells and in urinary EVs from DM patients with macroalbuminuria. Tail-vein injection of DM mice with EVs from HSA-induced HK-2 cells induced kidney macrophage M1 polarization and accelerated the progression of DKD through miR-199a-5p. miR-199a-5p exerted its effect by targeting Klotho, and Klotho induced macrophage  polarization through the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway both in vivo and in vitro.

Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed alterations in miR-carrier distribution in plasma of DM and DN patients compared to healthy controls. Both miR-21 and miR-126 increased in EVs of DN patients, whereas miR-660 increased in the Ago-2 fraction and miR-132 decreased in the HDL fractions. Moreover, in vitro, differentially expressed miRs improved EC barrier formation (EV-miR-21) and rescued the angiogenic potential (HDL-miR-132) of ECs cultured in serum from DM and DN patients. In conclusion, miR measurement in EVs, HDL and Ago-2 may improve the biomarker sensitivity of these miRs for microvascular injury in DN while carrier-specific miRs can improve endothelial barrier formation (EV-miR-21/126) or exert a pro-angiogenic response (HDL-miR-132).© 2019 by the American  Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606511>Quercetin Promotes Diabetic Wound Healing via Switching Macrophages From M1 to  Polarization.</a></h2><p>For patients with , excessive and long-lasting inflammatory reactions at the wound site commonly lead to the delayed refractory wound healing. The polarization of macrophages in terms of M1 and  phenotypes is closely related to the production of inflammatory cytokines. Quercetin is traditionally recognized to have anti-inflammatory effect; however, whether quercetin modulates macrophage polarization from M1 to  and thus promotes diabetic wound healing remain unknown.Wounded male diabetic rats were equally divided into five groups: model group, solvent control group (10% DMSO), and three drug groups treated with quercetin (Q) at concentrations of 10 mg/mL (Q-LD [low dose]), 20 mg/mL (Q-MD [medium dose]), and 40 mg/mL (Q-HD [high dose]), respectively. The anti-inflammatory effect of quercetin on diabetic wounds was observed. Immunohistochemistry and quantificational real-time polymerase chain reaction were applied to test the changes in macrophage polarization and inflammatory responses.The wound contraction was fastest in Q-HD group. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson's trichrome staining revealed that fibroblast distribution and collagen deposition in quercetin-treated groups were significantly higher than those in the model group. Immunohistochemistry tests showed more CD206-positive cells and less iNOS-positive cells in quercetin-treated groups. Furthermore, the levels of proinflammatory factors in quercetin-treated groups were lower than those in the model group, whereas the levels of the anti-inflammatory factors and angiogenesis-related factors were relatively higher.In short, quercetin inhibits inflammatory reactions via modulating macrophage polarization switching from M1 to  phenotype, thereby accelerating the diabetic wound repair.Copyright © 2019.

Several of the changes we observed, including enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory genes and dysregulated UPR and metabolism genes were first observed in the liver followed by the pancreas. In the present study we investigated further early changes in hepatic innate immunity and metabolism in two models of type 1  (T1D), the BBdp rat and NOD mouse. There was a striking increase in lipid deposits in liver, particularly in neonatal BBdp rats, with a less striking but significant increase in neonatal NOD mice in association with dysregulated expression of lipid metabolism genes. This was associated with a decreased number of extramedullary hematopoietic clusters as well as CD68 macrophages in the liver of both models. In addition, PPARɣ and phosphorylated AMPKα protein were decreased in neonatal BBdp rats. BBdp rats displayed decreased expression of antimicrobial genes in neonates and decreased  genes at 30 days. This suggests hepatic steatosis could be a common early feature in development of T1D that impacts metabolic homeostasis and tolerogenic phenotype in the prediabetic liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31393981>Indirect Effects of a Cognitive-Behavioral Intervention on Adolescent Weight and Insulin Resistance Through Decreasing Depression in a Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>Depression is linked to excess weight, insulin resistance, and type 2  (T2D). We previously reported that in adolescent girls at-risk for T2D with moderately elevated depression, randomization to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) produced greater decreases in depression at post-treament and greater decreases in fasting/2-h insulin at 1 year, compared to health education (HE). The current study is a secondary analysis of this parallel-group randomized controlled trial. We examined whether decreasing depression explained intervention effects on body composition and insulin outcomes. We hypothesized that decreases in depression would be an explanatory mediator and that indirect effects would be strongest at higher levels of baseline depression.Participants were 12-17 years girls with overweight/obesity and family history of T2D randomized to 6-week group CBT (n = 58) or HE (n = 61). Procedures took place at an outpatient pediatric clinic. At baseline, post-treatment, and 1 year, adolescents completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale to assess depression symptoms; body mass index (BMI [kg/]) was measured from height/fasting weight; insulin resistance was derived from 2-h oral glucose testing. Adiposity was assessed with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at baseline and 1 year. Indirect effects of intervention were tested on 1-year changes in BMI, adiposity, and insulin through decreases in depression. Baseline depression was tested as a moderator of mediation.There was an indirect effect of CBT on decreased 1-year fasting insulin via decreases in depression during treatment, among adolescents with more elevated baseline depression.Decreasing elevated depression may be one mechanism in the targeted prevention of T2D in at-risk adolescents.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of Pediatric Psychology 2019.

Metabolite profiling offers an opportunity to systematically discover new predictors for weight gain that are relatively easy to measure compared to traditional approaches.Using baseline metabolite profiling data of middle-aged individuals from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS; n = 1,508), we identified 42 metabolites associated (p < 0.05) with longitudinal change in body mass index (BMI). We performed stepwise linear regression to select 8 of these metabolites to build a metabolite risk score (MRS) for predicting future weight gain. We replicated the MRS using data from the Mexico City  Study (MCDS; n = 768), in which one standard deviation increase in the MRS corresponded to ~0.03 increase in BMI (kg/) per year (i.e. ~0.09 kg/year for a 1.7 m adult). We observed that none of the available anthropometric, lifestyle, and glycemic variables fully account for the MRS prediction of weight gain. Surprisingly, we found the MRS to be strongly correlated with baseline insulin sensitivity in both cohorts and to be negatively predictive of T2D in MCDS. Genome-wide association study of the MRS identified 2 genome-wide (p < 5 × 10-8) and 5 suggestively (p < 1 × 10-6) significant loci, several of which have been previously linked to obesity-related phenotypes.We have constructed and validated a generalizable MRS for future weight gain that is an independent predictor distinct from several other known risk factors. The MRS captures a composite biological picture of weight gain, perhaps hinting at the anabolic effects of preserved insulin sensitivity. Future investigation is required to assess the relationships between MRS-predicted weight gain and other obesity-related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31343140>Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) as the first manifestationof type 2  in a child.</a></h2><p>Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) may occur in young patients with type 1 and type 2  and in infants with hyperglycaemia. Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state is characterised by extremely high glucose concentration, which, by increasing osmotic diuresis, intensifies dehydration. Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state criteria include the following: plasma glucose > 600 mg/dl, venous pH > 7.25, sodium bicarbonate > 15 mmol/l, slight ketonuria, plasma osmolality > 320 mOsm/kg, and impairment of consciousness (aggression, unconsciousness, convulsions). We describe the case of a 13-year-old patient with severe obesity (at presentation body mass > 120 kg, BMI > 40 kg/), who developed HHS (glycaemia 647 mg/dl, pH 7.18, pCO2 96.5 mmHg, BE - 5.0 mmol/l, HCO3 35.2 mmol/l; Na 167 mmol/l, plasma osmolarity 370 mOsm/kg) in the course of pneumonia and newly diagnosed type 2  (HbA1c 15.5%, C-peptide 2.63 ng/ml). In the follow-up, due to the hypoglycaemia, insulin was discontinued, metformin was administered at a dose of 2 g/day, with a further reduction to 500 mg/day, together with physical rehabilitation and a low-calorie diet. Weight reduction during 6 months of observation was approximately 37 kg.

His experiments were conducted in the presence of excess oxygen, but today tumor tissue is known to be a hypoxic environment. However, an increase of glycolysis and lactate production is still a valid observation. Numerous abnormalities and mutations of metabolic enzymes have been found in many cancers. For example, pyruvate kinase  has been associated with many cancers and is a major contributor to directing glycolysis into fermentation, forming lactate. Increases in several enzymes, including glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase , Rad6, or deficiency of other enzymes such as succinate dehydrogenase, all may contribute directly or indirectly to increases in lactate associated with the Warburg effect. In addition, the increased lactate and acid-base changes are modified further by monocarboxylate transporters and carbonic anhydrase, which contribute to alkalinizing tumor cells while acidifying the tumor extracellular environment. This acidification leads to cancer spread. Fully understanding the mechanisms underlying the Warburg effect should provide new approaches to cancer treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Participants underwent physical examinations and completed questionnaires regarding 15 AHOs and health behaviors. Hypogonadism was defined as serum testosterone levels ≤3.0 ng/mL or use of testosterone replacement therapy. We investigated the role of 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs6258 and rs12150660) in the sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) locus implicated in increased hypogonadism risk in the general population.Of 491 TCS (median age at assessment, 38.2 years; range, 18.7-68.4 years), 38.5% had hypogonadism. Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis identified hypogonadism risk factors, including age at clinical evaluation (odds ratio [OR], 1.42 per 10-year increase; P= .006) and body mass index of 25 to <30 kg/ (OR, 2.08; P= .011) or ≥30 kg/ (OR, 2.36; P= .005) compared with <25 kg/. TCS with ≥2 risk alleles for the SHBG SNPs had a marginally significant increased hypogonadism risk (OR, 1.45; P= .09). Vigorous-intensity physical activity appeared protective (OR, 0.66; P= .07). Type of cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimen and socioeconomic factors did not correlate with hypogonadism. Compared with TCS without hypogonadism, those with hypogonadism were more likely to report ≥2 AHOs (65% vs 51%; P= .003), to take medications for hypercholesterolemia (20.1% vs 6.0%; P<.001) or hypertension (18.5% vs 10.6%; P= .013), and to report erectile dysfunction (19.6% vs 11.9%; P= .018) or peripheral neuropathy (30.7% vs 22.5%; P= .041). A marginally significant trend for increased use of prescription medications for either  (5.8% vs 2.6%; P= .07) or anxiety/depression (14.8% vs 9.3%; P= .06) was observed.At a relatively young median age, more than one-third of TCS have hypogonadism, which is significantly associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk factors, and erectile dysfunction.

Data on lifestyle-related factors (BMI, FBG, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity) were collected at baseline. Lifestyle-related risk factors were defined as mainly vegetable/mainly meat diet, former/current smoking, alcohol consumption ≥3 times/week, and no physical activity. Associations between these factors and IHD were examined using Cox proportional hazards regression models.High BMI (≥25 kg/), high FBG (≥100 mg/dL), mainly meat diet, and former/current smoking were associated with increased risk for IHD. Alcohol consumption ≤twice/week and physical activity ≤twice/week were associated with lower risk of IHD. With increased lifestyle-related risk factors, the risk of IHD also increased in women (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.18-4.73) and men (HR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.48-1.85). This increase was larger in women, with a significant sex interaction (p = 0.0001). Significant interactions between BMI and alcohol consumption (p = 0.0002) and between BMI and physical activity (p = 0.0063) were observed. Interactions were seen between FBG level and meal type in both BMI<25 kg/ (p = 0.0106) and BMI≥25 kg/ (p = 0.0281) and between FBG level and alcohol consumption in BMI ≥25 kg/ (p = 0.0118).The impact of lifestyle-related factors on IHD was more pronounced in women than in men and may be modified by BMI and FBG level among Korean adults.

The outcome measure was all-cause mortality. Of the 276 patients, 151 (55%) were medically treated, while 125 (45%) underwent an AVR. Over a mean follow-up of 3.2 ± 1.8 years (range 0-6.9 years), a total of 96 (34.8%) deaths occurred: 17 (13.6%) in AVR group vs. 79 (52.3%) in those medically treated, when transaortic flow was defined by FR (P < 0.001). When transaortic flow was defined by SVi, a total of 79 (31.3%) deaths occurred: 18 (15.1%) in AVR group vs. 61 (45.9%) in medically treated (P < 0.001). In a propensity-matched multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusting for age, gender, body surface area, smoking, hypertension, , atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular mass, and mean aortic gradient, not having AVR was associated with a 6.3-fold higher hazard ratio (HR) of all-cause mortality [HR 6.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.34-13.16; P < 0.001] when flow was defined by FR. In the SVi-guided model, it was 3.83-fold (HR 3.83, 95% CI 2.30-6.37; P < 0.001).In patients with normal flow low gradient severe AS, AVR was associated with a significantly improved survival compared with those who received standard medical treatment.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Portugal has the highest European unadjusted incidence and prevalence rates of ESKD. In 2012, we started to follow a cohort of elderly CKD patients, we describe their baseline characteristics, risk profile, and cardiovascular disease burden.All CKD patients aged 65 years and older referred to our department during 2012 were enrolled. Baseline data included: demographic, CKD stage, medication, comorbid conditions. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated by the CKD-EPI formula.A total of 416 patients, 50% referred by primary care physicians, aged 77 ± 7 years, 52% male, with a median eGFR of 32 mL/min/1.73m2 participated in the study. Fifty percent had  (DM), 85% dyslipidemia, 96% hypertension; 26% were current/former smokers, and 24% had a body mass index > 30 kg/.

Seven hundred thirty-eight T2DM patients were categorized into six groups, including 374 men and 364 post-menopausal women who were sub-divided into three groups based on albumin excretion that involved normal albuminuria, microalbuminuria, and large amount of albuminuria (138, 127, 109, 135, 125, and 104 cases, UACR<30, 30-300, and >300 mg/g, M1, , M3, F1, F2, and F3). Measurement of circulating miR-154-5p, OC, and other biochemical indicators were performed by real-time PCR, ELISA, and chemiluminescence assays in T2DM patients and in 141 M0 and 139 F0 control subjects.  There are few differences appeared between groups. Comparing with men, women had higher age, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), adiponectin (ADPN), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), UACR, procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), β-C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (β-CTx), OC, and miR-154-5p, but lower FPG, HOMA-IR, and HbA1c. T2DM patients with albuminuria (micro or macro) had lower bone turnover markers (P1NP, β-CTx, and OC) and adiponectin, but higher HbA1c, CTGF, and miR-154-5p. In addition, after regression analysis, UACR was positively correlated with CTGF, HbA1c, and miR-154-5p, and negatively correlated with ADPN and bone turnover markers (P1NP, β-CTx, and OC). However, OC showed a positive correlation with ADPN and other bone turnover markers (P1NP and β-CTx), but negative correlation with CTGF, UACR, and miR-154-5p in all three groups.  These findings suggested that increased serum levels of miR-154-5p and decreased OC levels may influence osteogenesis and proteinuria in T2DM and may identify novel targets for diagnosis and treatment of diabetic kidney disease and osteoporosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062080>Effects of dietary glutamine supplementation on immune cell polarization and muscle regeneration in diabetic mice with limb ischemia.</a></h2><p> is a chronic inflammatory disorder resulting in endothelial dysfunction which contributes to peripheral arterial disease and limb ischemia.

This study investigated the effects of dietary glutamine (GLN) supplementation on immune cell polarization in diabetic mice subjected to limb ischemia. was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin for 5 consecutive days in C57BL/6J mice. Diabetic mice were fed the AIN-93 diet or an AIN-93 diet in which a part of the casein was replaced by GLN. After 3 weeks of the dietary intervention, mice were subjected to unilateral femoral artery ligation to induce limb ischemia.GLN supplementation enhanced the proportion of anti-inflammatory monocytes and regulatory T cells in the blood. Expression of C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 by activated CD4 T cells was promoted and prolonged in the GLN-supplemented group. GLN downregulated the percentage of M1 macrophages in muscle tissues which was correlated with lower levels of C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 in plasma. The muscle M1/ ratio was also reduced in the GLN group. Gene expression of interleukin-6 was suppressed by GLN supplementation, while expression levels of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and myogenic differentiation 1 genes were elevated in post-ischemic muscles. Histological findings also indicated that muscle regeneration was accelerated in the GLN group.GLN supplementation in diabetic mice may exert more-balanced polarization of CD4 T cells, monocytes, and macrophages, thus attenuating inflammatory responses and contributing to muscle regeneration after limb ischemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31529060>Association between body mass index and stroke risk among patients with type 2 .</a></h2><p>Very few studies focused on the association between body mass index (BMI) and stroke risk among patients with .We aimed to investigate the association between BMI and stroke risk in patients with type 2 .Demographic, anthropometric, laboratory and medication information were extracted from the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network common data model.We performed a retrospective cohort study of 67,086 patients with type 2 .Incident stroke including both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke were defined.During a mean follow up of 3.74 years. 8,918 incident stroke events occurred.

Hepatic fat was measured by proton MRS, insulin sensitivity index (SI) calculated by minimal modeling from a frequently-sampled intravenous glucose test, RBC fatty acid profiles by gas chromatography were used to estimate SCD-1 indices. Hepatic fat, S, and SCD-1 were similar in black women and lower than in whites, regardless of menopausal status. Fasting and postprandial large, medium and small TRLPs, but not very small TRLPs, were lower in black women. Fasting large, medium and very small TRLPs negatively correlated with S and positively correlated with visceral and hepatic fat, and SCD-1 activity in both groups. In multivariate models, visceral fat and SCD-1 were associated with total fasting TRLP concentrations (adjR= 0.39, P=0.001). Black women had smaller postprandial changes in large (P=0.005) and medium TRLPs (P=0.007).  Lower visceral fat and SCD-1 activity may contribute to the paradoxical association of lower fasting and postprandial TRLP subfractions despite insulin resistance in black compared to white pre- and post-menopausal women. Similar concentrations of very small TRLPs are related to insulin resistance and could be important mediators of cardiometabolic disease risk in women.  .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336480>Association between selected trace elements and body mass index and waist circumference: A cross sectional study.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of obesity has increased worldwide.

Highest complication rates were observed among women with BMI ≥50 kg/m , including gestational  (29%), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (20%) and caesarean section (48%). Of infants born to women with BMI ≥50 kg/m , 12% were late-pre-term, 23% required special or intensive care and 20% had birth weight ≥4.0 kg. When compared with obese women with BMI 30-49 kg/m , women with BMI ≥50 kg/m were significantly more likely to develop a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (preeclampsia adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3.98 (1.93-8.18), pregnancy-induced hypertension aOR 3.55 (1.79-7.03)) and deliver a late pre-term infant (aOR 2.45 (1.31-4.58)).The prevalence of severe maternal obesity in our non-tertiary setting is higher than previous national estimates. Women with BMI ≥50 kg/m are an important subgroup of the obese obstetric population who experience high rates of complications and interventions.

Information of obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery was obtained from their medical records. The changes in the BMI, HbA1C, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), and lipid levels between three months before and after the surgery were assessed.The patients (n=106) were mostly Malay (66.0%), had at least one comorbidity (61.3%), and had a mean age of 40.38±11.75 years. Following surgery, the BMI of the patients was found to reduce by 9.78±5.82kg/. For the patients who had  (n=24) and hypertension (n=47), their mean HbA1C, SBP and DBP were also shown to reduce significantly by 2.02±2.13%, 17.19±16.97mmHg, and 11.45±12.63mmHg, respectively. Meanwhile, the mean total cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein levels of those who had dyslipidaemia (n=21) were, respectively, lowered by 0.91±1.18mmol/L, 0.69±1.11mmol/L and 0.47±0.52mmol/L.The findings suggest that in addition to weight reduction, bariatric surgery is helpful in improving the , hypertension and dyslipidaemia control among obese patients.

Metabolic surgery represents the operative treatment of type 2  and other metabolic disorders. Metabolic surgery does not focus on weight loss, as many mechanisms, which are responsible for the improvement of the glycemic control are independent from weight loss. There are many studies, which show the efficient effect of metabolic surgery in diabetic patients with class II obesity. Furthermore, there is growing evidence, that metabolic surgery does also work in patients with a BMI below 35 kg / . Multiple surgical and endocrinological associations have endorsed these facts and adopted their guidelines. In obese type 2 diabetics with a BMI below 35 kg /  and a poor glycemic control metabolic surgery should be considered as a therapeutic option.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076418>Characterization of Glycolytic Enzymes and Pyruvate Kinase  in Type 1 and 2 Diabetic Nephropathy.</a></h2><p>Elevated glycolytic enzymes in renal glomeruli correlated with preservation of renal function in the Medalist Study, individuals with ≥50 years of type 1 . Specifically, pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) activation protected insulin-deficient diabetic mice from hyperglycemia-induced glomerular pathology. This study aims to extend these findings in a separate cohort of individuals with type 1 and type 2  and discover new circulatory biomarkers for renal protection through proteomics and metabolomics of Medalists' plasma. We hypothesize that increased glycolytic flux and improved mitochondrial biogenesis will halt the progression of diabetic nephropathy.Immunoblots analyzed selected glycolytic and mitochondrial enzymes in postmortem glomeruli of non-Medalists with type 1  ( = 15), type 2  ( = 19), and no  ( = 5). Plasma proteomic (SOMAscan) ( = 180) and metabolomic screens ( = 214) of Medalists with and without stage 3b chronic kidney disease (CKD) were conducted and significant markers validated by ELISA.Glycolytic (PKM1, PKM2, and ENO1) and mitochondrial (MTCO2) enzymes were significantly elevated in glomeruli of CKD- versus CKD+ individuals with type 2 . Medalists' plasma PKM2 correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (  = 0.077;  = 0.0002). Several glucose and mitochondrial enzymes in circulation were upregulated with corresponding downregulation of toxic metabolites in CKD-protected Medalists. Amyloid precursor protein was also significantly upregulated, tumor necrosis factor receptors downregulated, and both confirmed by ELISA.Elevation of enzymes involved in the metabolism of intracellular free glucose and its metabolites in renal glomeruli is connected to preserving kidney function in both type 1 and type 2 .

Fifty-seven severely obese patients with a mean body mass index value of 44.1 ± 6 kg/ were consecutively recruited and received a complete ophthalmological evaluation and optical coherence tomography. Twenty-nine patients who underwent gastric bypass were evaluated also 3 months, and 1 year after surgery.At baseline, blood pressure value were directly and significantly related to intraocular pressure values (p<0.05, R = 0.35). Blood pressure values were also significantly and inversely related to retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, particularly in the temporal sector (RE p<0.05 r-0.30; LE p<0.01, R = -0.43). Moreover, minimum foveal thickness values were significantly and inversely associated with body mass index (RE p<0.02, R = -0.40; LE p<0.02, R = -0.30). A significant reduction of body mass index (p<0.05) and a significant (p<0.05) improvement of blood pressure was observed three months and one year after gastric bypass, which were significantly associated with an increase in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and minimum foveal thickness values in both eyes (p<0.05).The results of this study suggest that obese patients may have a greater susceptibility to develop glaucomatous optic nerve head damage and age-related macular degeneration.

There are little data substantiating current popular opinion that it is associated with knee pain or osteoarthritis (OA) later in life. We aimed to evaluate the relationship of football with these outcomes in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI).This is a study of male OAI participants with knee x-ray readings, symptom assessments, and completed surveys on lifetime physical activity. The OAI is a multi-center, observational cohort recruited from the community not based on football participation status. A history of exposure to American football was ascertained via self-report. Knee radiographs were scored for Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade (0-4). Radiographic OA (ROA) was defined as KL ≥ 2 in at least one knee. Frequent knee pain meant at least one knee with frequent knee pain. Symptomatic radiographic OA (SOA) required at least one knee with both ROA and frequent knee pain.1166 men had a mean age of 63.7 (SD 9.2) years and body mass index of 28.6 (SD 4.2) kg/. 31% (365/1166) played football at some point in their lives, 95% of whom participated from ages 12 - 18 years. The ORs for SOA from lowest to highest football participation were 1.2, 1.5, and 2.2 respectively (p for trend = 0.004). Findings were similar for football from ages 12 - 18 years and for outcomes of knee pain and ROA.This is the first large epidemiologic study to suggest that football participation, including in the teen years, may be detrimental towards knee health.

However, data regarding its impact on renal outcomes are scarce. We conducted a single-center, prospective cohort study of 339 type 2 diabetic patients with anemia. The primary outcome was the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope for two years. We performed multiple linear regression and restricted cubic spline analyses to assess the association of serum EPO levels with the renal outcome. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73  or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio >30 mg/g creatinine. Median baseline EPO and eGFR level were 14.4 IU/L and 53 mL/min/1.73 m, respectively. Inappropriately low EPO levels were observed in 73% of anemic patients and 59% of anemic patients even without CKD, suggesting that EPO deficiency precedes the onset of CKD in . Multivariable analysis revealed that iron status and hemoglobin levels were major determinants of EPO levels. Median eGFR slope was -1.3 mL/min/1.73 m/year. We found that low EPO levels, but not low hemoglobin levels, were associated with a faster decline in eGFR, independent of clinically relevant factors. The eGFR decline was steeper, particularly when the EPO level was below the upper limit of normal. Lower EPO concentrations were associated with rapid eGFR decline, especially in patients with iron deficiency (P for interaction = 0.01). Relative EPO deficiency should be considered as a culprit in anemia of unknown etiology in diabetic patients, even those without CKD. Low EPO levels, especially when accompanied by poor iron status, are predictive of rapid loss of renal function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31439648>Role of CCR2 in the Development of Streptozotocin-Treated Diabetic Cardiomyopathy.</a></h2><p>CCR2 has been proven to play an important role in . However, the role of CCR2 in diabetic cardiomyopathy has not been examined. In this study, we investigated the effects of cardiac CCR2 on diabetic cardiomyopathy. We created a model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy. Expression of CCR2 was upregulated in the hearts of STZ-induced diabetic mice. CCR2 knockout significantly improved STZ-induced cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis. Moreover, deletion of CCR2 inhibited STZ-induced apoptosis and the production of STZ-induced reactive oxygen species in the heart. CCR2 knockout resulted in  polarization in hearts of STZ-treated mice. Treatment with a CCR2 inhibitor reversed hyperglycemia-induced cardiac dysfunction in  mice. These results suggest that CCR2-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in the heart are involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy and that CCR2 could be a novel target for therapy.© 2019 by the American  Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967686>Macrophages of the subcutaneous and omental fatty tissue in obese patients: Immunohistochemical phenotyping of  subtypes in relation to type 2 .</a></h2><p>Macrophages are linked to the initiation of the chronic inflammation believed to underlie the changes taking place in the white fatty tissue of obese people.

In this study, we evaluated the M1 and  macrophages ratio in obese subjects with, or without . To identify all macrophages, we used CD68 expression, while CD204 expression is typically used for the  macrophage.During bariatric surgery, carried out in obese people with and without type 2  (T2D), we obtained subcutaneous adipose tissue from the navel and omental adipose tissue. We also obtained the same tissue from people with a physiological range of BMI from a judicial autopsy. Applying immunohistochemical staining anti-CD68 and anti-CD204, we carried out a quantitative evaluation of the number of macrophages.We found CD68+ and CD204+ positive macrophages in perivascular spaces and between fat cells, both isolated and in larger infiltrates. They were also present in so-called "crown-like structures" (CLS) around dying adipocytes. Quantitative analysis showed an increased number of macrophages in all obese patients compared to the control group of non-obese, individuals without T2D. The most striking observation was the macrophage increase in the visceral fatty tissue of diabetics. The number of CD68 and CD204 positive macrophages was statistically significantly smaller in patients without T2D.We demonstrated a significantly greater number of macrophages in visceral adipose tissue, especially in patients with T2D.

Patients with serial echocardiograms, baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥50% and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥90 mL/min/1.73  were matched 1:1 with patients with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73  for age (±5 years), sex, history of hypertension or , use of renin-angiotensin inhibitors, and LVEF (±5%). A secondary analysis included patients with preserved LVEF and normal left ventricular mass index matched for the same parameters except use of renin-angiotensin inhibitors.Patients with CKD were at increased risk for HFpEF admission: crude hazard ratio (HR) 1.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.38-2.32, p < 0.001) and adjusted HR (for coronary disease, loop diuretics, left atrial diameter) 1.64 (95% CI 1.22-2.21, p = 0.001). LVEF and left ventricular diameter decreased over time in both groups but no difference was observed in rate of dropping.

This study compared subcuticular suture closure with staple closure regarding the aesthetics of the neck incision scar.A single-blinded comparative prospective study with two cohorts involving one facility and multiple surgeons was done to study all consecutive patients who underwent one/two-level ACDF operations from 2015-2016. We excluded patients with corpectomies, postoperative wound infection, reoperations in the same admission, any previous ACDF operations, non-compliance in follow-up, and inability to give informed consent. We did single-layer skin stapling without platysma closure or subcuticular suture with platysma closure. Patients followed up between 1.5 and six months. We used the Stony Brook Scar Evaluation Scale (SBSES), range 0-5 with five being the best score. Digital images were taken in a standardized manner and saved in a secure database. A blinded plastic surgeon and a blinded neurosurgeon, not involved in the operation, evaluated the scars using SBSES. A priori sample size using a clinically significant difference of one was determined. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used; a p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.We studied 93 staple and 66 suture closures. There is no significant difference between the groups regarding age, sex, the incidence of , smoking, obesity (body mass index (BMI) >30 kg/), chemotherapy or the length of the incision. There is no statistically significant difference regarding SBSES as evaluated by the plastic surgeon (staples vs. sutures, median 2 vs. 2, range 0-5, p = 0.32).

Triggers of eryptosis include increased cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration, oxidative stress, osmotic shock, energy depletion and several uremic toxins. Little is known about the pathogenesis of eryptosis in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients; furthermore, its relevance in worsening clinical conditions in these patients is still not completely defined.We investigated eryptosis levels in PD patients and its association with inflammatory and clinical parameters.A total of 46 PD patients and 17 healthy subjects (CTR) were enrolled. All eryptosis measurements were made in freshly isolated RBCs using the flow cytometer.Eryptosis was significantly higher in PD patients than that in CTR (p < 0.001). Eryptosis levels did not differ significantly between PD patients with and without , with and without hypertension, and with and without cardiovascular disease. Eryptosis showed no significant differences between patients treated with continuous ambulatory PD/automated PD, with Kt/Vurea value ≤1.7 and >1.7, with a negative or positive history of peritonitis. On the contrary, eryptosis showed significantly lower levels in PD patients with weekly creatinine clearance ≥45 L/week/1.73  (2.8%, 1.7-4.9 vs. 5.6%, 5.0-13.5; p= 0.049). Eryptosis showed significantly lower levels in PD patients with residual diuresis (n = 23) than that in patients without (3.7%, 2.6-5.6 vs. 5%, 3.1-16; p = 0.03). In these 23 patients, significant negative correlations between percentage of eryptosis and residual glomerular filtration rate (rGFR; Spearman's rho = -0.51, p = 0.01) and diuresis volume (Spearman's rho = -0.43, p = 0.05) were found.The present study demonstrated higher eryptosis levels in PD patients compared to corresponding levels in CTR. Furthermore, important PD comorbidity and main PD parameters do not influence eryptosis. Importantly, our data have reported an increase in eryptosis levels with progressive residual diuresis and rGFR loss, probably due to decreased uremic toxins clearance.© 2019 S.

Early in embryonic development, pre-macrophages arise from the fetal yolk sac and track through the bloodstream to reach diverse embryonic tissues, where they mature. Most of these macrophages exhibit an -like phenotype. The critical period for neural tube closure is contained within the period of yolk sac-derived pre-macrophage tracking and distribution, which poses a question: might these pre-macrophages or macrophages exert an influence on the closing neural tube? Evidence suggests that perturbations in macrophage polarization or  macrophage function might contribute to the failure of neural tube closure associated with , one carbon metabolism (including folic acid deficit), inositol, arachidonic acid, and sphingosine-1-phosphate, as well as in the teratogenicity of nitric acid, valproic acid, and fumonisin. The influence of each of these factors is interpreted in light of potential interactions with -like macrophages or macrophage progenitors on the developing neural tube. By placing these anti inflammatory macrophages at the center of various epigenetic, neurochemical, and signaling processes suspected to be involved in neural tube closure, potential associations are revealed between macrophages and embryonic structural developmental processes such as collagen and actin dynamics. The choice of this model is also an attempt to explain why some etiologies for failure of neural tube closure are rescued by folic acid, whereas other etiologies are rescued only by formate, inositol, or not at all.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Some traditional pharmaceutical compounds may shift the polarization of recruited macrophages to improve metabolic homeostasis. TanshinoneⅡA (TAN2A) is a major active component of Salvia miltiorrhiza, a traditional anti-inflammatory cardiovascular medicine. In our study, we firstly constructed a phenanthroimidazole derivative of TAN2A named TAN20 by chemical synthesis, then identified its structure by chromatography and hydrogen spectroscopy, and finally examined its effects on immunometabolic responses. We found that TAN20 significantly induced the alternatively-activated () rather than the classically-activated macrophages (M1), mainly through releasing the type II cytokines. Such effects were more pronounced than that from TAN2A. Compared to TAN2A, TAN20 substantially reduced body weight, decreased serum free fatty acid and HOMA-IR, and increased insulin sensitivity in obesity-induced diabetic mice. These effects of TAN20 were further validated on diabetic cynomolgus monkeys, which are closer to human physiological conditions. Taken together, our findings explicitly showed that TAN20 significantly polarized the macrophage and improved metabolic homeostasis in obesity-induced diabetic models, suggesting that TAN20 may be a potential drug against  and obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Binary logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the uncorrected and corrected odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, with the >=18.5-22.9 group serving as a reference.A total of 11,136 pregnant women were analyzed. Incidences of above mentioned six adverse outcomes were greater in women with higher pre-pregnancy BMI. The risks of the abovementioned six adverse outcomes were increased significantly among the >=23-23.9, >=24-24.9, >=25-27.9 groups and substantially higher in the >=28-29.9, >=30 groups after correction. <18.5 group showed an increased risk of small-for-gestational age infants.For women of childbearing age in Beijing, China, the optimal pre-pregnancy BMI range was >=18.5-22.9 kg/, with the cutoff value for overweight status being >=23.0 kg/ and the cutoff value for obesity being >=28.0 kg/.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621859> by Air, Land, and Sea: Effect of Deployments on HbA1c and BMI.</a></h2><p>Service members (SMs) in the United States (U.S.) Armed Forces have  at a rate of 2-3%. Despite having a chronic medical condition, they have deployed to environments with limited medical support. Given the scarcity of data describing how they fare in these settings, we conducted a retrospective study analyzing the changes in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and body mass index (BMI) before and after deployment.SMs from the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps with  who deployed overseas were identified through the Military Health System (MHS) Management Analysis and Reporting Tool and the Defense Manpower Data Center. Laboratory and pharmaceutical data were obtained from the MHS Composite Health Care System and the Pharmacy Data Transaction Service, respectively. Paired t-tests were conducted to calculate changes in HbA1c and BMI before and after deployment.SMs with  completed 11,325 deployments of greater than 90 days from 2005 to 2017. Of these, 474 (4.2%) SMs had both HbA1c and BMI measurements within 90 days prior to departure and within 90 days of return. Most (84.2%) required  medications: metformin in 67.3%, sulfonylureas in 19.0%, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors in 13.9%, and insulin in 5.5%. Most SMs deployed with an HbA1c < 7.0% (67.1%), with a mean predeployment HbA1c of 6.8%. Twenty percent deployed with an HbA1c between 7.0 and 7.9%, 7.2% deployed with an HbA1c between 8.0 and 8.9%, and 5.7% deployed with an HbA1c of 9.0% or higher. In the overall population and within each military service, there was no significant change in HbA1c before and after deployment. However, those with predeployment HbA1c < 7.0% experienced a rise in HbA1c from 6.2 to 6.5% (P < 0.001), whereas those with predeployment HbA1c values ≥7.0% experienced a decline from 8.0 to 7.5% (P < 0.001). Those who deployed between 91 and 135 days had a decline in HbA1c from 7.1 to 6.7% (P = 0.010), but no significant changes were demonstrated in those with longer deployment durations. BMI declined from 29.6 to 29.3 kg/ (P < 0.001), with other significant changes seen among those in the Army, Navy, and deployment durations up to 315 days.Most SMs had an HbA1c < 7.0%, suggesting that military providers appropriately selected well-managed SMs for deployment. HbA1c did not seem to deteriorate during deployment, but they also did not improve despite a reduction in BMI. Concerning trends included the deployment of some SMs with much higher HbA1c, utilization of medications with adverse safety profiles, and the lack of HbA1c and BMI evaluation proximal to deployment departures and returns. However, for SMs meeting adequate glycemic targets, we demonstrated that HbA1c remained stable, supporting the notion that some SMs may safely deploy with . Improvement in BMI may compensate for factors promoting hyperglycemia in a deployed setting, such as changes in diet and medication availability.

Eight of them were with genome-wide significance and two with a border line association. Since these data have not been studied in an independent Han Chinese population, we aimed to investigate the association of these susceptibility loci with type 2  in an independent Han Chinese population. We executed a case-control study in 2 000 Chinese by the SNPscan method. Firstly, the repetitive sequences of 10 loci were assessed. Next, we investigated the association of 8 SNPs out of 10 with type 2  and constructed the GRS of those 8 SNPs. Finally, the relationship of the 8 loci and -related traits was analyzed. Based on the fact, that highly repetitive sequences were detected in 2 SNPs, we investigated the remaining 8 SNPs. With the exception of four SNPs (CMIP rs16955379, PEPD rs3786897, PSMD6 rs831571, ZFAND3 rs9470794), the other SNPs had the same direction of effect (odds ratio [OR]>1.0) as in the original reports, especially GLIS3 rs7041847 and KCNK16 rs1535500 were significantly associated with type 2  (rs1535500: p=0.005, OR=1.224, 95% CI 1.062-1.409; rs7041847: p=0.035, OR=1.118, 95% CI 1.070-1.388). The GRS constructed from the 8 SNPs was significantly associated with type 2  in the Chinese population (p=0.004, OR=1.065, 95% CI: 1.021-1.111). Among the participants with 24≤BMI<28 kg/ the 8 SNPs were significantly associated with type 2  (p=0.040, OR=1.079, 95% CI: 1.003-1.160).

We aimed to study the association of RHR with rapid renal function decline (RRFD) and to explore whether the association of RHR with RRFD is modulated by arterial stiffness in individuals with type 2 . Approach and Results: One thousand one hundred forty-two Asian people with type 2  were followed for 3.9±0.9 years in a regional hospital and a primary care facility. RRFD was defined as eGFR decline of 5 mL/min per 1.73  or greater per year. Arterial stiffness was assessed by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. One hundred sixty-eight participants (15%) were classified as having RRFD. Participants with elevated RHR were younger, had higher levels of HbA1c, albuminuria, C-reactive protein, and pulse wave velocity. Compared with the lowest quartile, participants in quartile 4 had a higher risk for RRFD after adjustment for known risk factors (adjusted odds ratio 1.91 [1.11-3.28]). RHR improved discrimination and net reclassification for prediction of RRFD above traditional risk factors. Remarkably, arterial stiffness modulated the association of RHR with RRFD ( for interaction =0.03). RHR was significantly associated with risk of RRFD only in those with increased arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity above age-reference value 7.7 m/s).RHR independently predicts RRFD, and the association is modulated by arterial stiffness. An elevated heart rate may be one factor in the spectrum of cardiovascular risk factors associated with renal functional impairment, especially in those with type 2  and an increased arterial stiffness.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31483474>Quality of Chronic Kidney Disease Management in Canadian Primary Care.</a></h2><p>Although patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are routinely managed in primary care settings, no nationally representative study has assessed the quality of care received by these patients in Canada.To evaluate the current state of CKD management in Canadian primary care practices to identify care gaps to guide development and implementation of national quality improvement initiatives.This cross-sectional study leveraged Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network data from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2015, to develop a cohort of 46 162 patients with CKD managed in primary care practices. Data analysis was performed from August 8, 2018, to July 31, 2019.The study examined the proportion of patients with CKD who met a set of 12 quality indicators in 6 domains: (1) detection and recognition of CKD, (2) testing and monitoring of kidney function, (3) use of recommended medications, (4) monitoring after initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), (5) management of blood pressure, and (6) monitoring for glycemic control in those with  and CKD. The study also analyzed associations of divergence from these quality indicators.The cohort comprised 46 162 patients (mean [SD] age, 69.2 [14.0] years; 25 855 [56.0%] female) with stage 3 to 5 CKD. Only 4 of 12 quality indicators were met by 75% or more of the study cohort. These indicators were receipt of an outpatient serum creatinine test within 18 months after confirmation of CKD, receipt of blood pressure measurement at any time during follow-up, achieving a target blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or lower, and receiving a hemoglobin A1c test for monitoring  during follow-up. Indicators in the domains of detection and recognition of CKD, testing and monitoring of kidney function (specifically, urine albumin to creatinine ratio testing), use of recommended medications, and appropriate monitoring after initiation of treatment with ACEIs or ARBs were not met. Only 6529 patients (18.4%) with CKD received a urine albumin test within 6 months of CKD diagnosis, and 3954 (39.4%) had a second measurement within 6 months of an abnormal baseline urine albumin level. Older age (≥85 years) and CKD stage 5 were significantly associated with not satisfying the criteria for the quality indicators across all domains. Across age categories, younger patients (aged 18-49 years) and older patients (≥75 years) were less likely to be tested for albuminuria (314 of 1689 patients aged 18-49 years [18.5%], 1983 of 11 919 patients aged 75-84 years [61.6%], and 614 of 5237 patients aged ≥85 years [11.7%] received the urine albumin to creatinine ratio test within 6 months of initial estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min per 1.73 ; P < .001). Patients aged 18 to 49 years were less commonly prescribed recommended medications (222 of 2881 [7.7%]), whereas patients aged 75 to 84 years were prescribed ACEIs or ARBs most frequently (2328 of 5262 [44.2%]; P < .001).The findings suggest that management of CKD across primary care practices in Canada varies according to quality indicator.

We developed and validated a prediction model for anterior circulation LVO stroke using past medical history elements present on admission and neurological examination. Methods- We retrospectively reviewed AIS patients admitted between 2009 and 2017 to 3 hospitals within a large healthcare system in the United States. Patients with occlusions of the internal carotid artery or M1 or  segments of the middle cerebral artery were randomly split into 2/3 derivation and 1/3 validation cohorts for development of an anterior circulation LVO prediction model and score that was further curtailed for potential use in the prehospital setting. Results- A total of 1654 AIS were reviewed, including 248 (15%) with proximal anterior circulation LVO AIS. In the derivation cohort, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at the time of cerebrovascular imaging, current smoking status, type 2 , extracranial carotid, and intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis was significantly associated with anterior circulation LVO stroke. The prehospital score was curtailed to National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, current smoking status, and type 2 . The areas under the curve for the prediction model, prehospital score, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score alone were 0.796, 0.757, and 0.725 for the derivation cohort and 0.770, 0.689, and 0.665 for the validation cohort, respectively. The Youden index J was 0.46 for a score of >6 with 84.7% sensitivity and 62.0% specificity for the prediction model. Conclusions- Previously reported LVO stroke prediction scores focus solely on elements of the neurological examination. In addition to stroke severity, smoking, , extracranial carotid, and intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis were associated with anterior circulation LVO AIS. Although atherosclerotic stenosis may not be known until imaging is obtained, smoking and  history can be readily obtained in the field and represent important elements of the prehospital score supplementing National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31398219>Do the body mass index and the diagnosis of gestational  influence the level of physical activity during pregnancy and postpartum?</a></h2><p>Obesity and lack of physical exercise are associated with the increase of  in women of reproductive age and during the gestational period.

The sample was stratified according to preconception BMI and the presence or absence of diagnosis of GDM, resulting in four groups with 66 participants each: low risk pregnancy (LRP) with normal weight (BMI ≥ 18.5 and ≤ 24 kg/), LRP and overweight/obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/), GDM with normal weight and GDM with overweight/obese. The level of PA of each participant was measured as Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) during the preconceptional period (T0), in the third trimester of gestation (T1), and three months after delivery (T2). The comparison of the MET values showed that the values found in the evaluation three months after delivery (T2) were higher than 1.00 (1.10 MET for the LRP-normal weight, 1.06 MET for LRP-overweight/obese, 1.02 MET for the GDM- normal weight, 1.07 MET for the GDM-overweight/obese). On the pre-gestational (T0) and third trimester (T1) analyzes, the values were less than 1.00 MET. The analysis between groups in relation to BMI and diagnosis of GDM showed no difference.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428971>Short-Term  Remission Outcomes in Patients with BMI ≤ 30 kg/m Following Sleeve Gastrectomy.</a></h2><p>Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has become the most popular bariatric procedure. Although bariatric surgery is recommended for type 2  (T2DM) in Asian patients with BMI 27.5-32.4 kg/m, reported evidences, especially following SG, are still lacking.Patients' data from June 2016 to June 2018 that underwent SG as primary surgery at our setting were analyzed. Patients with T2DM, without insulin use and BMI 27.5-30 kg/m, were our main criteria. Preoperative and postoperative parameters were as such: age, BMI, T2DM duration, anti-diabetic medications, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin, C-peptide, and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Follow-up duration was at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.Eighteen patients (7 male and 11 female) were presented for this study. The mean age and  duration were 46.3 ± 11.9 years and 31.8 ± 26.5 months, respectively. The mean preoperative vs postoperative 12-month assessment was as such: BMI 29.3 ± 0.9 vs 23.9 ± 0.9 kg/m, FPG 8.4 ± 3.1 vs 5.6 ± 0.7 mmol/L, HbA1c 8.3 ± 1.8 vs 5.9 ± 0.7%, insulin 103.9 ± 47.4 vs 53.9 ± 13.1 pmol/L, C-peptide 1.90 ± 1.22 vs 1.08 ± 0.44 ng/ml, and HOMA-IR 5.5 ± 4.0 vs 1.9 ± 0.6, all reached statistical significance (p value < 0.05).In short-term, and also under strict selection criteria, SG can result in both improvement and remission of T2DM in patients with BMI 27.5-30 kg/m. Larger sample size and longer follow-up duration will be needed in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31060902>The Notch ligand DNER regulates macrophage IFNγ release in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</a></h2><p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide with no curative therapy. A non-canonical Notch ligand, DNER, has been recently identified in GWAS to associate with COPD severity, but its function and contribution to COPD is unknown.DNER localisation was assessed in lung tissue from healthy and COPD patients, and cigarette smoke (CS) exposed mice. Microarray analysis was performed on WT and DNER deficient M1 and  bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM), and gene set enrichment undertaken. WT and DNER deficient mice were exposed to CS or filtered air for 3 day and 2 months to assess IFNγ-expressing macrophages and emphysema development. Notch and NFKB active subunits were quantified in WT and DNER deficient LPS-treated and untreated BMDM.Immunofluorescence staining revealed DNER localised to macrophages in lung tissue from COPD patients and mice. Human and murine macrophages showed enhanced DNER expression in response to inflammation. Interestingly, pro-inflammatory DNER deficient BMDMs exhibited impaired NICD1/NFKB dependent IFNγ signalling and reduced nuclear NICD1/NFKB translocation. Furthermore, decreased IFNγ production and Notch1 activation in recruited macrophages from CS exposed DNER deficient mice were observed, protecting against emphysema and lung dysfunction.DNER is a novel protein induced in COPD patients and 6 months CS-exposed mice that regulates IFNγ secretion via non-canonical Notch in pro-inflammatory recruited macrophages. These results provide a new pathway involved in COPD immunity that could contribute to the discovery of innovative therapeutic targets.This work was supported from the Helmholtz Alliance 'Aging and Metabolic Programming, AMPro'.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Total health related costs, Glycated Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) and BMI was recorded. Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA) was used. Utility values according to results of A1c were obtained from published studies.Improvements were observed in A1C (8.6% at baseline to 6.2% in the first year, p < 0.001) and BMI (30.7 kg/m at baseline to 24.3 kg/m in the first year, p < 0.001), and the effect lasted for 4 years after RYGB. In the CMM group, A1C fluctuated in four years. The health utility for RYGB group scores 3.756, whereas CMM group scores 3.594 in four years. The total healthcare costs decreased sharply from the second year after RYGB ($8,483 [¥52,596] in the first year to $672[¥4,164] in the second year, p < 0.001) and maintained for 3 years. In the CMM group, the total healthcare costs changed without significance. RYGB costs US$19,359 (¥125,836) per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained (incremental cost-utility ratio [ICUR]) compared to CMM, which was lower than a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $20,277/QALY.Compared to CMM, RYGB is cost-effective for Chinese patients with type 2  and obesity 4 years after operation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31216384>Autologous transplantation of photoactivated subcutaneous adipose tissue improves glucose homeostasis in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence indicates that normal adipose tissue transplantation improves whole-body energy metabolism and glucose homeostasis in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model. Adipose tissue macrophages are associated with glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance in type 2  and obesity in humans, offering a potential target for therapeutics. However, whether transplantation of autologous adipose tissue that changes the macrophage phenotype directly contributes to systemic glucose intolerance has not been determined. We specifically developed our device, with more refined wavelengths of light to activate the macrophage phenotype in isolated subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) from host HFD mice. Autologous transplantation of photoactivated sWAT into HFD mice significantly reverses the M1 macrophage phenotype into , reduces the infiltration of macrophages in adipose tissues of HFD mice, and decreases the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Strikingly, this transplantation reduced blood glucose levels and caused significant improvement in glucose tolerance, which was not shown in sham-operated or nonphotoactivated sWAT-transplanted HFD mice. Moreover, positron emission/computed tomography scans indicated higher glucose uptake in the heart but not in the liver, hindlimb muscles, or abdominal sWAT. These data suggested that the ability of photoactivation to shift Adipose tissue macrophage polarization in HFD mice caused a significant improvement in glucose homeostasis and that autologous transplantation might be a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of .© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31086840>Glycated albumin is correlated with glycated hemoglobin in type 2 .</a></h2><p>Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) retrospectively evaluates mean glycemia in the preceding 2-3 months and is the gold standard for assessing glycemic control, while glycated albumin (GA) is currently considered a short to intermediate term integrated glycemic control marker, since it reflects glycemic status over the last 3 weeks. We aimed to investigate the levels of GA, HbA1c and fasting glycemia in a group of patients with type 2 .The observational study included adult type 2  patients (n=135) according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, randomly selected from Clinical Centre of , Cluj-Napoca, Romania. Fasting glycemia, GA, HbA1c and creatinine were measured using commercially available methods.Of the whole group, 62 (45.9%) were men. Mean age was 62.1±8.6 years old, body mass index was 31.8±6.1 kg/ and  duration was 10.0 (4.0; 15.0) years. Fasting glycemia was 162±13.7 mg/dl, GA was 28.0 (21.0; 40.0)% and HbA1c 8.9±2.3%. We found GA was significantly correlated with HbA1c (r=0.19; p=0.029) and fasting glycemia (r=0.32; p<0.001), while HbA1c was significantly correlated with fasting glycemia (r=0.40; p<0.001).GA was significantly correlated with both HbA1c and fasting glycemia in our patients with type 2 . While HbA1c is recognized as being the reference test for  control monitoring, GA might a useful biomarker for assessing short to intermediate term glycemic control, particularly important in situations when HbA1c test cannot be reliable or earlier clinical decision making is mandatory.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968941>Effects of tai chi on physiology, balance and quality of life in patients with type 2 : A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>To systematically synthesize and critically evaluate evidence on the effects of tai chi for patients with type 2 .Seven electronic databases (Wan Fang, SinoMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library) were systematically searched from their inception to March 2018.Randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of tai chi on individuals with type 2  were eligible.Biomedical outcomes (fasting plasma glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting insulin, insulin resistance, body mass index, total cholesterol, blood pressure) as well as balance and quality of life-related outcomes were extracted independently by 2 reviewers. Stata 12.0 software was used to synthesize data if there was no or moderate heterogeneity across studies. Otherwise, narrative summaries were performed.A total of 23 studies (25 articles) involving 1,235 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Significant changes in tai chi-related effects were observed in lowering fasting plasma glucose (standardized mean difference; SMD -0.67; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) -0.87 to -0.47; p <0.001), HbA1c (mean difference; MD-0.88%; 95% CI -1.45% to -0.31%; p =0.002) and insulin resistance (MD -0.41; 95% CI -0.78 to -0.04; p = 0.029). Beneficial effects of tai chi were also found in decreasing body mass index (MD -0.82 kg/; 95% CI -1.28 to -0.37 kg/; p < 0.001) and total cholesterol (SMD -0.59; 95% CI -0.90 to -0.27; p < 0.001). In addition, tai chi reduced blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (MD -10.03 mmHg; 95% CI -15.78 to -4.29 mmHg; p = 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (MD -4.85 mmHg; 95% CI -8.23 to -1.47 mmHg; p = 0.005)) and improved quality of life-related outcomes (physical function (MD 7.07; 95% CI 0.79-13.35; p = 0.027), bodily pain (MD 4.30; 95% CI 0.83-7.77; p = 0.015) and social function (MD 13.84; 95% CI 6.22-21.47; p < 0.001)). However, no impact was exerted on fasting insulin (SMD -0.32; 95% CI -0.71 to 0.07; p = 0.110) or balance (MD 2.71 s; 95% CI -3.29 to 8.71 s; p = 0.376).Tai chi is effective in controlling biomedical outcomes and improving quality of life-related outcomes in individuals with type 2 , although no effects were observed on balance and fasting insulin. Further high-quality research is needed to elucidate the effects of different types of tai chi, the long-term effects of tai chi, the impact on respiratory function, and the association between tai chi and the risk of developing type 2  in healthy individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049566>Metabolomics Reveal Altered Postprandial Lipid Metabolism After a High-Carbohydrate Meal in Men at High Genetic Risk of .</a></h2><p>The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene confers one of the strongest genetic predispositions to type 2 , but  development can be modified by diet.The aim of our study was to evaluate postprandial metabolic alterations in healthy men with a high genetic risk of , after two meals with varying macronutrient content.The study was conducted in 21 homozygous nondiabetic men carrying the high-risk (HR, n = 8, age: 31.2 ± 6.3 y, body mass index (BMI, kg/) 28.5 ± 8.1) or low-risk (LR, n = 13, age: 35.2 ± 10.3 y, BMI: 28.1 ± 6.4) genotypes at the rs7901695 locus. During two meal challenge test visits subjects received standardized isocaloric (450 kcal) liquid meals: high-carbohydrate (HC, carbohydrates: 89% of energy) and normo-carbohydrate (NC, carbohydrates: 45% of energy). Fasting (0 min) and postprandial (30, 60, 120, 180 min) plasma samples were analyzed for metabolite profiles through untargeted metabolomics. Metabolic fingerprinting was performed on an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system connected to an iFunnel quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer.In HR-genotype men, after the intake of an HC-meal, we noted a significantly lower area under the curves (AUCs) of postprandial plasma concentrations of most of the phospholipids (-37% to -53%, variable importance in the projection (VIP) = 1.2-1.5), lysophospholipids (-29% to -86%, VIP = 1.1-2.6), sphingolipids (-32% to -47%, VIP = 1.1-1.3), as well as arachidonic (-36%, VIP = 1.4) and oleic (-63%, VIP = 1.3) acids, their metabolites: keto- and hydoxy-fatty acids (-38% to -78%, VIP = 1.3-2.5), leukotrienes (-65% to -83%, VIP = 1.4-2.2), uric acid (-59%, VIP = 1.5), and pyroglutamic acid (-65%, VIP = 1.8). The AUCs of postprandial sphingosine concentrations were higher (125-832%, VIP = 1.9-3.2) after the NC-meal, AUCs of acylcarnitines were lower (-21% to -61%, VIP = 1.1-2.4), and AUCs of fatty acid amides were higher (51-508%, VIP = 1.7-3.1) after the intake of both meals.In nondiabetic men carrying the TCF7L2 HR genotype, subtle but detectable modifications in intermediate lipid metabolism are induced by an HC-meal.

We previously reported high PD-1/PDL-1 staining in ATC, raising the possibility of the productive application of the immunotherapeutic pembrolizumab. However, having found pembrolizumab to anecdotally have limited single-agent activity in ATC, we sought to alternatively define whether pembrolizumab might synergistically combine with chemoradiotherapy as initial ATC therapy.An investigator-initiated therapeutic phase 2 trial of pembrolizumab, 200 mg IV every 3 weeks, combined with chemoradiotherapy [docetaxel/doxorubicin, 20 mg/ each IV weekly plus volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)] was initiated as front-line therapy (with or without surgery) in ATC to assess efficacy and toxicities. Six-month overall survival (OS) was selected as the primary endpoint using a Simon's optimal design with interim analysis (targeting accrual of 25 patients; Cohort A: prior resection, Cohort B: no resection). Based upon a prior patient cohort treated similarly, but without pembrolizumab, the design was such that, if 6 month true survival is 75%, the probability of declaring the approach worthy of further pursuit would be 91%.Three patients were enrolled, two with rapidly enlarging unresectable neck masses. Early tumor responses were favorable in all three, and all three satisfactorily completed: intended radiotherapy, preceding and radiotherapy-concurrent pembrolizumab, and concurrent chemoradiotherapy. However, all three patients died <6 months following therapy initiation - one from pulmonary metastases, and two from otherwise unexpected fatal pulmonary complications occurring subsequent to chemoradiotherapy completion - prompting study closure.Although initially tolerated and effective in terms of locoregional disease control, disappointing survival outcomes compared to historical controls raise uncertainty that the piloted approach merits further pursuit in ATC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31529059>Continuous Free Cortisol Profiles in Healthy Men - Validation of Microdialysis Method.</a></h2><p>In humans, approximately 95% of circulating cortisol is bound to corticosteroid-binding globulin and albumin. It is only the free fraction that is biologically active and can activate signalling pathways via glucocorticoid hormone receptors in cells. Microdialysis is a well-established technique that enables the sampling of molecules in different compartments of the body, including extracellular fluid. This is the first study validating a rapid sampling microdialysis method measuring free cortisol in the subcutaneous and blood compartments of healthy volunteers.Healthy non-smoking volunteers (42 men; age 18-24 years; BMI 18-25 kg/) received placebo (saline), 250 µg Synacthen or 1 mg dexamethasone with ten minutely sampling to measure total and free cortisol (subcutaneous, intravenous and saliva) for an hour before and 4 hours after administration.Following stimulation by Synacthen, total serum cortisol and free cortisol in both compartments rose significantly, achieving and maintaining maximum levels between 2 and 3 hours following the stimulus. A decline in cortisol levels was evident after the administration of dexamethasone or placebo, but there was a clear pulsatile activity around lunchtime in the latter group which was prominent in the blood compartment (total and free cortisol). There was good correlation between serum total and free cortisol (SC and intravenous) in the Synacthen and dexamethasone groups with no significant delay (less than 5 minutes) between total and free cortisol.This seminal study demonstrated the dynamic responses of total blood cortisol and microdialysis derived free cortisol in blood, subcutaneous tissue and saliva in man.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Dietary intakes of BCAAs including, valine, leucine, and isoleucine were collected at baseline using the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Odds ratio (OR) of hypertension were determined by logistic regression across quartiles of BCAAs, adjusted for sex, age, smoking status, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), , and some dietary factors.The mean ± standard deviation for age and BMI of participants (41.9% men) were 39.7 ± 12.8 years and 26.9 ± 4.6 kg/  , respectively. The median intakes of total BCAAs, valine, leucine, and isoleucine was 17.9, 5.5, 7.8, and 4.5 percentage of total amino acids intake, respectively. We documented 429 (10%) hypertension incident cases. The multivariable adjusted OR for the highest vs lowest quartiles of BCAAs was 1.54 (95% confidence interval (CI):1.03-2.32; P for trend = 0.05); furthermore, the OR (95% CI) of hypertension for the highest vs the lowest quartile of valine was 1.61 (1.10-2.36; P for trend = 0.009) in the fully adjusted model. However, we found no significant association between leucine and isoleucine with incidence of hypertension.Findings indicated that higher BCAA intake, in particular valine, is associated with higher risk of incident hypertension.© 2019 The Author(s).

However, lithium exposure has been associated with an impaired renal concentrating ability (RCA) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We examined RCA and estimated GFR in a cohort of patients treated with lithium.134 patients (≥ 18 years of age) with a mood disorder treated with lithium were screened; 100 patients were included. Demographic and clinical characteristics and blood and urine samples were collected. Additionally, a dDAVP-test was performed to determine maximal RCA.A dDAVP-test was performed in 98 patients (37 males, 61 females). Mean age was 51 years (SD: 12), median duration of lithium therapy 7 years (IQR: 4-15), mean maximal urine osmolality (Uosmol) 725 mOsmol/kg (SD: 153), and median eGFR 84 ml/min/1.73  (IQR: 68-95). Fifty patients (51%) had an impaired RCA and 17 patients (17%) had nephrogenic  (Uosmol 600-800 and < 600 mOsmol/kg, respectively). Notably, clinical symptoms did not predict an impaired RCA. Nineteen patients (19%) had an eGFR ≤ 60 ml/min/ 1.73 . Multivariable regression analysis showed a significant association between the duration of lithium treatment and maximal Uosmol (B = -6.1, 95%-CI: -9.4, -2.9, p < 0.001) and eGFR (B = -0.6, 95%-CI: 0.2, -3.3; p < 0.01).RCA is impaired in the majority of lithium-treated patients. Both RCA and eGFR are inversely associated with the duration of lithium therapy. Prospective follow-up will enable us to evaluate if abnormalities in RCA can be used to predict the development of lithium-induced chronic kidney disease.</p></html>
