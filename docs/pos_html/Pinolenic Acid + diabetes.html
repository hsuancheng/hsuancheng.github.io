Moreover, T2D patients with rs174537 GG genotype were at risk of developing T2D&CAD (odds ratio (OR) 1.763; 95 % CI 1.143-2.718; p = 0.010), with elevated plasma LDL-cholesterol, arachidonic , and delta-6 desaturase.Our results show that SNPs in FADS gene (particularly rs174537) associate with plasma fatty acids and desaturase levels in patients with both T2D and CAD, which maybe increases the risk of CAD in diabetic patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31514316>Docosahexaenoic and Eicosapentaenoic Acids Prevent Altered-Muc2 Secretion Induced by Palmitic  by Alleviating Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in LS174T Goblet Cells.</a></h2><p>Diets high in saturated fatty acids (FA) represent a risk factor for the development of obesity and associated metabolic disorders, partly through their impact on the epithelial cell barrier integrity. We hypothesized that unsaturated FA could alleviate saturated FA-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurring in intestinal secretory goblet cells, and consequently the reduced synthesis and secretion of mucins that form the protective mucus barrier. To investigate this hypothesis, we treated well-differentiated human colonic LS174T goblet cells with palmitic  (PAL)-the most commonly used inducer of lipotoxicity in in vitro systems-or -9, -6, or -3 unsaturated fatty acids alone or in co-treatment with PAL, and measured the impact of such treatments on ER stress and Muc2 production. Our results showed that only eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids protect goblet cells against ER stress-mediated altered Muc2 secretion induced by PAL, whereas neither  nor -9 and -6 FA are able to provide such protection. We conclude that EPA and DHA could represent potential therapeutic nutrients against the detrimental lipotoxicity of saturated fatty acids, associated with type 2  and obesity or inflammatory bowel disease. These in vitro data remain to be explored in vivo in a context of dietary obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28480372>FREE FATTY ACIDS PROFILING IN RESPONSE TO CARNITINE SYNERGIZE WITH LUTEIN IN DIABETIC RATS.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to investigate the fatty acids profiling in diabetic rats induced by sterptozocine (STZ) and their response to administration of lutein and carnitine.Ninety male albino rats were divided into 6 groups as follows: Normal control. The remaining rats were injected  a single dose of STZ (65 mg /kg bw) for induction of . Diabetic rats were grouped as: GP II: (Untreated): GP III: Rats were given orally with L-lutein (100 mg/kg bw).GP IV: Rats were given carnitine (30 μg/kg) . GP V: Rats were given carnitine and lutein GP VI were given metformin (100mg/kg bw/d) for 6 weeks.Treatment of diabetic rats with lutein, L-carnitine, combined decreased the levels of glucose, HA1C compared with untreated diabetic (p<0.001). Administration of L-lutein, carnitine, combined to normal rats significantly decreased the levels of myristic, palmitice, palmitoleic, stearic, linoleic, α-, arachidic and eicosadienoic when compared with control normal rats (p<0.001).Abnormalities of fatty acids composition was observed in diabetic rats. Combination treatment with lutein and carnitine could ameliorate deleterious effect induced by STZ and attenuate the changed fatty  composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26764053>LA and ALA prevent glucose intolerance in obese male rats without reducing reactive lipid content, but cause tissue-specific changes in fatty  composition.</a></h2><p>While the cause of Type 2  remains poorly defined, the accumulation of reactive lipids within white adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver have been repeatedly implicated as underlying mechanisms. The ability of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to prevent the development of insulin resistance has gained considerable interest in recent years; however, the mechanisms-of-action remain poorly described. Therefore, we determined the efficacy of diets supplemented with either linoleic  (LA) or α- (ALA) in preventing insulin resistance and reactive lipid accumulation in key metabolic tissues of the obese Zucker rat. Obese Zucker rats displayed impaired glucose homeostasis and reduced n-3 and n-6 PUFA content in the liver and epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT). After the 12-wk feeding intervention, both LA- and ALA-supplemented diets prevented whole body glucose and insulin intolerance; however, ALA had a more pronounced effect. These changes occurred in association with n-3 and n-6 accumulation in all tissues studied, albeit to different extents (EWAT > liver > muscle). Triacylglycerol (TAG), diacylglycerol (DAG), ceramide, and sphingolipid accumulation were not attenuated in obese animals supplemented with either LA or ALA, suggesting that preservation of glucose homeostasis occurred independent of changes in reactive lipid content. However, PUFA-supplemented diets differentially altered the fatty  composition of TAGs, DAGs, and PLs in a tissue-specific manner, suggesting essential fatty  metabolism differs between tissues. Together, our results indicate that remodeling of the fatty  composition of various lipid fractions may contribute to the improved glucose tolerance observed in obese rats fed PUFA-supplemented diets.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25097001>Adipose tissue n-3 fatty acids and metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Evidence regarding the relationship of n-3 fatty acids (FA) to type 2  and metabolic syndrome components (MetS) is inconsistent.To examine associations of adipose tissue n-3 FA with MetS.We studied 1611 participants without prior history of  or heart disease who were participants in a population-based case-control study of diet and heart disease (The Costa Rica Heart Study). We calculated prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for MetS by quartile of n-3 FA in adipose tissue derived mainly from plants (α- (ALA)), fish (eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA)) or metabolism (docosapentaenoic  (DPA), as well as the EPA:ALA ratio, a surrogate marker of delta-6 desaturase activity).N-3 FA levels in adipose tissue were associated with MetS prevalence in opposite directions. The PR (95% CI) for the highest compared with the lowest quartile adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), residence, lifestyle, diet and other FAs were 0.60 (0.44, 0.81) for ALA, 1.43 (1.12, 1.82) for EPA, 1.63 (1.22, 2.18) for DPA and 1.47 (1.14, 1.88) for EPA:ALA, all P for trend <0.05. Although these associations were no longer significant (except DPA) after adjustment for BMI, ALA and DPA were associated with lower glucose and higher triglyceride levels, P<0.05 (respectively).These results suggest that ALA could exert a modest protective benefit, whereas EPA and DHA are not implicated in MetS. The positive associations for DPA and MetS could reflect higher delta-6 desaturase activity caused by increased adiposity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27025974>From the α to the ω-3: Breaking the link between impaired fetal growth and adult cardiovascular disease.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerotic vascular disease is an important cause of premature morbidity and mortality. An extensive body of epidemiologic data links impaired fetal growth, evidenced by reductions in birth weight, with a higher risk for cardiovascular disease in adulthood. This association appears to be at least partially independent of established cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and type 2 . There is currently no clinically established strategy to prevent cardiovascular events secondary to being born with poor fetal growth. This review summarizes recent evidence that suggests that ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may be beneficial for this indication; in particular being associated with more marked reductions in blood pressure and subclinical atherosclerosis in people who were born with poor fetal growth, than in those with healthy birth weight. Possible mechanisms, and the evidence base required to support the implementation of dietary guidelines specific to people born with impaired fetal growth are also described.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The SM obtained was given to obese/diabetic KK-A(y) mice and wild-type C57BL/6J mice. SM supplementation significantly increased fecal lipids paralleled with a decrease in non-HDL cholesterol levels in the serum and neutral lipids and in cholesterol levels in the livers of KK-A(y) mice. The reduction of liver lipid levels also resulted in a decrease in the total fatty  content of the KK-A(y) mice livers, while n-3 fatty acids derived from the conversion of α- (18:3n-3) increased due to SM supplementation. In contrast to the KK-A(y) mice, little change in the serum and liver lipids was observed in wild-type C57BL/6J mice.

To this effect, we evaluated FFA profiles among healthy subjects and NAFLD patients stratified by body weight, to identify FFA valuable for early diagnosis of NAFLD.Serum FFA profiles of healthy and NAFLD (lean, overweight and obese) subjects was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and distinctions in FFA patterns were evaluated using one-way ANOVA while Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and logistic regression models were used to explore FFA significant for diagnosing NAFLD.NAFLD patients presented significantly higher (P < 0.05) serum FFA profiles compared to healthy controls (HC). While total FFA profiles were insignificantly different between lean (2093.33 ± 558.11 μg/ml) and overweight (2420.81 ± 555.18 μg/ml) NAFLD patients, obese NAFLD (2739.01 ± 810.35 μg/ml) presented most significantly elevated (P < 0.05) total FFA profiles compared with HC.

Fatty acids may contribute by acting as precursors of signalling molecules or by direct activity on receptors. The medium- and long-chain NEFA receptor FFA1 (free fatty  receptor 1, previously known as GPR40) has been linked to enhancement of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, whereas FFA4 (free fatty  receptor 4, previously known as GPR120) has been associated with insulin-sensitising and anti-inflammatory effects, and both receptors are reported to protect pancreatic islets and promote secretion of appetite and glucose-regulating hormones. Hypothesising that FFA1 and FFA4 mediate therapeutic effects of dietary components, we screened a broad selection of NEFA on FFA1 and FFA4 and characterised active compounds in concentration-response curves. Of the screened compounds, pinolenic , a constituent of pine nut oil, was identified as a relatively potent and efficacious dual FFA1/FFA4 agonist, and its suitability for further studies was confirmed by additional in vitro characterisation. Pine nut oil and free and esterified pure pinolenic  were tested in an acute glucose tolerance test in mice. Pine nut oil showed a moderately but significantly improved glucose tolerance compared with maize oil. Pure pinolenic  or ethyl ester gave robust and highly significant improvements of glucose tolerance. In conclusion, the present results indicate that pinolenic  is a comparatively potent and efficacious dual FFA1/FFA4 agonist that exerts antidiabetic effects in an acute mouse model. The compound thus deserves attention as a potential active dietary ingredient to prevent or counteract metabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30153579>Phosphorylation of protein kinase B, the key enzyme in insulin-signaling cascade, is enhanced in linoleic and arachidonic -treated HT29 and HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Defects in the insulin-signaling pathway have been implicated in the pathogenesis of impaired glucose uptake, insulin resistance, and type 2 . However, the specific defects that precipitate these abnormalities are yet to be fully elucidated. After binding to insulin, the plasma membrane-embedded insulin receptor transmembrane protein initiates a cascade of phosphorylation that leads to the activation of protein kinase B (AKT) and subsequently to the initiation of some metabolic actions of insulin. The activities of this receptor, insulin binding, and tyrosine kinase activation is dependent on its plasma lipid environment. Published data on the influence of omega-3 and -6 polyunsaturated fatty acids on insulin response are scarce. Moreover, the findings of the published investigations, most of which used omega-3 and -6, polyunsaturated fatty- blends, have been inconclusive. Hence, further, well thought out research is needed. The aim of the current study was to elucidate the effect of treatments with linoleic  (LNA), arachidonic  (ARA),  (ALA), docoshexaenoic  (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) on cell membrane composition and consequently on the insulin-signaling pathway and specifically AKT phosphorylation.Human colon adenocarcinoma (HT29) and liver hepatocellular (HepG2) cells were treated with or without 40 µM of LNA, ARA, ALA, EPA, or DHA for 48 h, the fatty- composition of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) from the treated cells by capillary gas liquid chromatograph. Cells were incubated for 30 min with or without human insulin (50 ng/mL), and the phosphorylation of AKT was assessed with the use of Western blotting.The fatty acids were incorporated in the PtdCho and PtdEtn of both cell lines, but the level of incorporation was higher in HT29. Phosphorylation of AKT increased when HT29 was treated with LNA (P < 0.05) and ARA (P < 0.01) but not with ALA, EPA, or DHA. A similar but non-significant increase in AKT phosphorylation was observed in LNA- and ARA- treated HepG2 cells.The finding of this investigation demonstrates that plasma membrane lipid bilayer enrichment with LNA or ARA treatment enhances insulin action by AKT activation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to address this question in the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) population. Dietary intakes of participants without T2D (n=2,139) were assessed using the validated food frequency questionnaire. To assess the risk of T2D after 6 years of follow-up, we used multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models. Three major dietary fat patterns were: (1) high amounts of dietary cholesterol, saturated fats, oleic , linoleic , , and trans fats; (2) high amounts of long-chain polyunsaturated fats; and (3) high amounts of dietary cholesterol and saturated fats. Dietary total fat intake hazard ratio [HR=1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.77~2.23 and HR=0.69, 95% CI=0.27~1.76, in the second and third tertile, respectively] was not related to the development of T2D. Animal- and plant-based dietary fat intakes were additionally not related to the risk of T2D. After adjustment for confounding variables, there was no significant association between dietary fat pattern score and T2D incidence. Whereas, the third pattern had a borderline negative association with  development (HR=0.56, 95% CI=0.29~1.07). These novel data suggest that dietary fat composition may modify the risk of T2D incidence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24355403>Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids during gestation and lactation to a vitamin B12-deficient or -supplemented diet improves pregnancy outcome and metabolic variables in Wistar rats.</a></h2><p>Maternal vitamin B12 deficiency leads to an adverse pregnancy outcome and increases the risk for developing  and metabolic syndrome in mothers in later life. Our earlier studies have demonstrated that vitamin B12 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are interlinked in the one carbon cycle. The present study for the first time examines the effect of maternal n-3 PUFA supplementation to vitamin B12 deficient or supplemented diets on pregnancy outcome, fatty- status and metabolic variables in Wistar rats. Pregnant dams were assigned to one of the following groups: control, vitamin B12 deficient, vitamin B12 supplemented, vitamin B12 deficient + n-3 PUFA or vitamin B12 supplemented + n-3 PUFA. The amount of vitamin B12 in the supplemented group was 0.50 μg kg(-1) diet and n-3 PUFA was  (ALA) 1.68, eicosapentaenoic  5.64, docosahexaenoic  (DHA) 3.15 (g per 100g fatty acids per kg diet). Our findings indicate that maternal vitamin B12 supplementation did not affect the weight gain of dams during pregnancy but reduced litter size and weight and was ameliorated by n-3 PUFA supplementation. Vitamin B12 deficiency or supplementation resulted in a low percentage distribution of plasma arachidonic  and DHA. n-3 PUFA supplementation to these diets improved the fatty- status. Vitamin B12 deficiency resulted in higher homocysteine and insulin levels, which were normalised by supplementation with either vitamin B12 or n-3 PUFA. Our study suggests that maternal vitamin B12 status is critical in determining pregnancy outcome and metabolic variables in dams and that supplementation with n-3 PUFA is beneficial.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31416272>Dietary Fat Intake and Metabolic Syndrome in Older Adults.</a></h2><p>Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 , and cancer worldwide.To assess fat intake in older adults with or without MetS.Cross-sectional nutritional survey in older adults living in the Balearic Islands ( = 477, 48% women, 55-80 years old) with no previous CVD.Assessment of fat (total fat, MUFA, PUFA, SFA, TFA, linoleic , α-, marine and non-marine ω-3 FA, animal fat and vegetable fat, cholesterol) and macronutrient intake using a validated food frequency questionnaire, and its comparison with recommendations of the US Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the Spanish Society of Community Nutrition (SENC).Participants with MetS showed higher BMI, lower physical activity, higher total fat and MUFA intake, and lower intake of energy, carbohydrates, and fiber than participants without MetS. Men and women with MetS were below the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) proposed by IOM for carbohydrates and above the AMDR for total fat and MUFAs, and women were below the AMDR proposed for α- (ALA) compared with participants without MetS.Subjects with MetS were less likely to meet IOM and SENC recommendations for fat and macronutrient intakes as compared to non-MetS subjects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27434045>Association of Plasma Phospholipid n-3 and n-6 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids with Type 2 : The EPIC-InterAct Case-Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>Whether and how n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are related to type 2  (T2D) is debated. Objectively measured plasma PUFAs can help to clarify these associations.Plasma phospholipid PUFAs were measured by gas chromatography among 12,132 incident T2D cases and 15,919 subcohort participants in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-InterAct study across eight European countries. Country-specific hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Prentice-weighted Cox regression and pooled by random-effects meta-analysis. We also systematically reviewed published prospective studies on circulating PUFAs and T2D risk and pooled the quantitative evidence for comparison with results from EPIC-InterAct. In EPIC-InterAct, among long-chain n-3 PUFAs, α- (ALA) was inversely associated with T2D (HR per standard deviation [SD] 0.93; 95% CI 0.88-0.98), but eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) were not significantly associated. Among n-6 PUFAs, linoleic  (LA) (0.80; 95% CI 0.77-0.83) and eicosadienoic  (EDA) (0.89; 95% CI 0.85-0.94) were inversely related, and arachidonic  (AA) was not significantly associated, while significant positive associations were observed with γ- (GLA), dihomo-GLA, docosatetraenoic  (DTA), and docosapentaenoic  (n6-DPA), with HRs between 1.13 to 1.46 per SD. These findings from EPIC-InterAct were broadly similar to comparative findings from summary estimates from up to nine studies including between 71 to 2,499 T2D cases. Limitations included potential residual confounding and the inability to distinguish between dietary and metabolic influences on plasma phospholipid PUFAs.These large-scale findings suggest an important inverse association of circulating plant-origin n-3 PUFA (ALA) but no convincing association of marine-derived n3 PUFAs (EPA and DHA) with T2D. Moreover, they highlight that the most abundant n6-PUFA (LA) is inversely associated with T2D.

Few studies have examined the impact of n-3 PUFA-containing botanical oils on T2D.Fifty-nine subjects with early-stageT2D or metabolic syndrome participated in an 8-week, randomized, single-blind, parallel intervention study and were provided PUFA-containing oils. Individuals received either corn oil (CO), a botanical oil (BO) combination (borage [Borago officinalis L.]/echium oil [Echium plantagineum L.]) or fish oil (FO). The BO combination was enriched in , gamma-, and stearidonic acids and the FO in eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids. Serum fatty acids and other serum lipids(triglycerides and total, HDL and LDL cholesterol), as well as markers of inflammation (leptin, and C-reactive protein) and glucose regulation (glucose and hemoglobin A1c) were assessed from fasting participants at baseline and after the intervention.Compliance was verified by expected increases in specific PUFAs in each of the three oil arms. Participants in the CO group showed no differences in serum lipids, markers of inflammation or glucose regulation between pre- and post-treatment measures.

The aim of this study was to examine the influence of ω-3 ALA on IS and adiponectin.We conducted a randomized study in patients with T2DM and assessed IS using HEC. Twenty patients with T2DM were included and randomly assigned to receive 3 g/d of ALA or placebo for 60 d, in a double-blind design. The assessment of IS by HEC was performed at baseline and after 60 d in all patients; blood samples were taken for the measurement of serum lipids, glucose, insulin, adiponectin, and cytokines. The primary outcome variables were an increase of both glucose infusion rate (GIR) in steady state and glucose metabolization (M) by HEC. The secondary outcomes were an increase in adiponectin levels and a decrease in fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index, lipids and cytokines. The study was conducted at an academic medical center.The ALA group improved IS corrected for fat-free mass (M/FFM; P = 0.04). Both groups showed increased adiponectin after 60 d (P = 0.01), however, the increase for the ALA group was greater (P = 0.04). In the ALA group, adiponectin was positively correlated with GIR (r = 0.76; P = 0.01) and M/FFM (r = 0.62; P = 0.06), and negatively correlated with HOMA-IR (r = -0.61; P = 0.03).ω-3 ALA supplementation improved glucose homeostasis and was associated with an increase in adiponectin. Improvement in the overall metabolic profile with ω-3 ALA suggests a potential clinical utility for this agent and requires further investigation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

NO production was measured in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages for 24 h at concentrations up to 100 μg/mL and antidiabetic potential was assessed by α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibition (up to 10 mg/mL) assays. The phytochemical composition of the extracts was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).The methanol leaf extract had the highest activity against DPPH• (IC = 26 μg/mL) and ABTS• (IC = 140 μg/mL), FRAP (IC = 48 μg/mL) and CCA (IC = 770 μg/mL). Only the dichloromethane leaf extract (LDCM) showed anti-inflammatory activity (IC = 48 μg/mL).

Two months before insemination, the rabbits (15 animals/group) were fed different diets: commercial standard (group C), supplemented with 10% extruded linseed (group L), and 3% fish oil (group FO). The L group does showed both the highest feed intake before AI (P < 0.01) and the highest body weight (BW) throughout pregnancy (P < 0.001). The L does yielded less milk than the C does (P < 0.001); however, no differences were observed in either weight or size of litter at weaning. Regardless of diet, insulin concentrations and HOMA-IR values were higher during the first half of pregnancy (P < 0.001). Nevertheless, the L does showed higher mean insulin concentrations than FO rabbits (P < 0.01) and the lowest glucose clearance (P < 0.01) during pregnancy. On the other hand, pregnant FO rabbits showed the lowest glucose concentrations (P < 0.05) and the lowest Homeostasis model assessment values for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, P < 0.05) as well as a faster restoration of baseline glucose levels following glucose load (P < 0.001). Before and during pregnancy, the BW of the rabbits was positively related to fasting sample- and tolerance test-derived indices of insulin resistance (P < 0.05) suggesting that a high pre-pregnancy BW predisposes to gestational insulin resistance. Linseed supplementation increased BW and predisposed to insulin resistance during pregnancy; whereas, fish oil improved insulin sensitivity without significant changes in BW.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

STZ was used to induce apoptosis of RIN5 F cells in vitro and T1- and T2DM in vivo. The effect of PUFAs: γ- (GLA), arachidonic  (AA) of ω-6 series, and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) of ω-3 series; cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitors and antiinflammatory metabolite of AA and DHA, lipoxin A4 (LXA4), and resolvin D2 and protectin, respectively against STZ-induced cytotoxicity to RIN5 F cells in vitro and LXA4 against T1- and T2DM in vivo was studied. Changes in the antioxidant content, lipid peroxides, nitric oxide, and expression of PDX1, P65, nuclear factor-κb (NF-κb), and IKB genes in STZ-treated RIN5 F cells in vitro and Nrf2, GLUT2, COX2, iNOS protein levels in the pancreatic tissue of T1- and T2DM and LPCLN2 (lipocalin 2), NF-κb, IKB I in adipose tissue of T2DM after LXA4 treatment were studied. Plasma glucose, insulin, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels also were measured in STZ-induced T1- and T2DM Wistar rats.Among all PUFAs tested, AA and EPA are the most effective against STZ-induced cytotoxicity to RIN5 F cells in vitro. Neither COX nor LOX inhibitors blocked the cytoprotective action of AA in vitro and T1- and T2DM by STZ. LXA4 production by RIN5 F cells in vitro and plasma LXA4 levels in STZ-induced T1- and T2DM animals were decreased by STZ that reverted to normal after AA treatment. AA prevented both T1- and T2DM induced by STZ. Antiinflammatory metabolite of AA and LXA4 prevented both T1- and T2DM induced by STZ. The expression of Pdx1, NF-κb, IKB genes in the pancreas and plasma TNF-α levels in T1- and T2DM; Nrf2, Glut2, COX2, and iNOS proteins in pancreatic tissue of T1DM and LPCLN2, NF-κb, IKB I in adipose tissue of T2DM reverted to normal in LXA4-treated animals.Both AA and LXA4 prevented STZ-induced cytotoxicity to RIN5 F cells in vitro and T1- and T2DM in vivo, suggesting that these two bioactive lipids may function as antidiabetic molecules.

In the past few decades, many epidemiological studies have been conducted on the myriad health benefits of omega-3 PUFAs. In this review, we summarized the structural features, properties, dietary sources, metabolism, and bioavailability of omega-3 PUFAs and their effects on cardiovascular disease, , cancer, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, depression, visual and neurological development, and maternal and child health. Even though many health benefits of omega-3 PUFAs have been reported in the literature, there are also some controversies about their efficacy and certain benefits to human health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30923750>Delta-6-desaturase (FADS2) inhibition and omega-3 fatty acids in skeletal muscle protein turnover.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential dietary components. They are not only used for energy, but also act as signaling molecules. The delta-6 desaturase (D6D) enzyme, encoded by the FADS2 gene, is one of two rate limiting enzymes that convert the PUFA precursors - α- (n-3) and linoleic  (n-6) to their respective metabolites. Alterations in the D6D enzyme activity alters fatty  profiles and are associated with metabolic and inflammatory diseases including cardiovascular disease and type 2 . Omega-3 PUFAs, specifically its constituent fatty acids DHA and EPA, are known for their anti-inflammatory ability and are also beneficial in the prevention of skeletal muscle wasting, however the mechanism for muscle preservation is not well understood. Moreover, little is known of the effects of altering the n-6/n-3 ratio in the context of a high-fat diet, which is known to downregulate protein synthesis. Twenty C57BL6 male mice were fed a high-fat lard (HFL, 45% fat (mostly lard), 35% carbohydrate and 20% protein, n-6:n-3 PUFA, 13:1) diet for 6 weeks. Mice were then divided into 4 groups (n = 5 per group): HFL- , high-fat oil- (HFO, 45% fat (mostly Menhaden oil), 35% carbohydrate and 20% protein, n-6:n-3 PUFA, 1:3), HFL+ (HFL diet plus an orally administered FADS2 inhibitor, 100 mg/kg/day), and HFO+ (HFO diet plus an orally administered FADS2 inhibitor, 100 mg/kg/day). After 2 weeks on their respective diets and treatments, animals were sacrificed and gastrocnemius muscle harvested. Protein turnover signaling were analyzed via Western Blot. 4-EBP1 and ribosomal protein S6 expression were measured. A two-way ANOVA revealed no significant change in the phosphorylation of both 4EBP-1 and ribosomal protein S6 with diet or inhibitor. There was a significant reduction in STAT3 phosphorylation with the inhibition of FADS2 (p = 0.03). Additionally, we measured markers of protein degradation through levels of FOXO phosphorylation, ubiquitin, and LC3B expression; there was a trend towards increased phosphorylation of FOXO (p = 0.08) and ubiquitinated proteins (p = 0.05) with FADS2 inhibition. LC3B expression, a marker of autophagy, was significantly higher in the HFL plus FADS2 inhibition group from all other comparisons. Lastly, we analyzed activation of mitochondrial biogenesis which is closely linked with protein synthesis through PGC1-α and Cytochrome-C expression, however no significant differences were associated with either marker across all groups. Collectively, these data suggest that the protective effects of muscle mass by omega-3 fatty acids are from inhibition of protein degradation. Our aim was to determine the role of PUFA metabolites, DHA and EPA, in skeletal muscle protein turnover and assess the effects of n-3s independently. We observed that by inhibiting the FADS2 enzyme, the protective effect of n-3s on protein synthesis and proliferation was lost; concomitantly, protein degradation was increased with FADS2 inhibition regardless of diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25733475>Plasma nutrient biomarkers are associated with waist-to-height ratio in youth with type 1 .</a></h2><p>Plasma fatty acids (FAs) and micronutrients have been associated with central obesity in adults; however, previous studies of these associations in adults have yielded mixed results. In addition, no comparable research has been conducted among youth with type 1  (T1D).We investigated the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between plasma nutrient biomarkers and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) in youth with T1D.These analyses included 1324 youth aged 3-20 y at T1D diagnosis with a baseline visit in the SEARCH (Search for  in Youth) Study and a subset of 1178 of these youth with a follow-up visit an average of 23 mo (range: 16-40 mo) after their baseline visit. Plasma phospholipid FAs and vitamins were measured, and estimated desaturase activities were calculated at baseline. Anthropometric measurements and -related assessments were collected at each visit. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the association between plasma nutrient biomarkers and WHtR.In cross-sectional analysis, plasma palmitic  (P = 0.004), dihomo-γ- (DGLA; P = 0.017) and Δ6 desaturase (D6D; P = 0.006) were positively correlated with WHtR after adjustment of confounders.

The results showed that peony seed oil showed weak anti-α-amylase activity; however, strong anti-α-glucosidase activity was noted. The GC-MS analysis of the oil showed 9 constituents of which α- was found to be the major component (38.66%), followed by linoleic  (26.34%) and oleic  (23.65%). The anti-diabetic potential of peony seed oil was tested in STZ induced diabetic mice. Administration of peony seed oil and glibenclamide reduced the blood glucose level and the area under curve (AUC) in STZ induced diabetic mice. There were significant increases in body weight, liver glycogen content, serum insulin level, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and decreases in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C), total serum cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG) in test groups as compared to the untreated diabetic groups. In vivo antioxidant studies on STZ induced diabetic mice revealed the reduction of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increase of glutathione peroxides (GSH-px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione (GSH). The results provided a sound rationale for future clinical trials of oral administration of peony seed oil to alleviate postprandial hyperglycemia in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28792694>Metabolic Profiling of Plasma in Gestational  Using Liquid Chromatography and Q-TOF Mass Spectrometry.</a></h2><p>To delineate the metabolomic profiling and identify early diagnostic biomarkers in maternal plasma from the pregnant women who subsequently developed gestational  (GDM) using liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF MS).Plasma samples were collected from GDM pregnant women (n = 30) and healthy controls (n = 30) at the 20th gestational week in Huzhou Central Hospital and Huzhou Maternal and Child Health Hospital.

A comprehensive search was conducted with MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) ≥1 month in duration that compared diets enriched in ALA with usual diets on glycemic parameters. For each study, the risk of bias as well as the study quality was assessed. Using the statistical software RevMan (v5.3), data were pooled using the generic inverse method with random effects model, and final results were expressed as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed by the Cochran Q statistic and quantified by the I statistic.A total of 8 trials (N = 212) were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to a control diet, a median dose of 4.4 g/day of ALA intake for a median duration of 3 months did not affect HbA1c (%) (MD = -.01; [95%: -.32, .31], P = .96). A median ALA dose of 5.4 g/day did not lower FBG (MD = .07; [95% CI: -.61, .76], P = .84) or FBI (MD = 7.03, [95% CI: -5.84, 19.89], P = .28). Summary effect estimates were generally compromised by considerable and unexplained heterogeneity (I ≥75%). In the subgroup analysis of continuous predictors, a reduction in HbA1c (%) and FBG (mmol/L) was significantly associated with an increased intake of ALA. Further adjustment for Publication Bias using Duval and Tweedie's trim-and-fill analysis provided an adjusted, significant MD of -.25 (95% CI: -.38, -.12; P <.001) for HbA1c (%).ALA-enriched diets did not affect HbA1c, FBG, or FBI. The scarce number of existing RCTs and the presence of heterogeneity in our meta-analysis limit the ability to make firm conclusions about ALA in T2DM management.

In a case-control study of 622 Chinese T2D patients and 293 healthy controls, a genetic risk score (GRS) was created based on nine T2D genetic variants. Logistic regression was used to examine the interaction of the GRS with erythrocyte phospholipid n-3 fatty acids for T2D risk. Every 1-unit (corresponding to 1 risk allele) increase in GRS was associated with 12% (Odds ratio (OR): 1.12; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.04-1.20) higher risk of T2D. Compared with the lowest quartile, participants had lower T2D risk in the 2nd (OR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.36-0.84), 3rd (OR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.38-0.88) and 4th (OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.44-1.03) quartile of  (ALA) levels. Significant interaction (-interaction = 0.029) of GRS with ALA for T2D risk was observed. Higher ALA levels were associated with lower T2D risk only among participants within the lowest GRS tertile, with ORs 0.51 (95% CI: 0.26-1.03), 0.44 (95% CI: 0.22-0.89) and 0.49 (95% CI: 0.25-0.96) for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th ALA quartile, compared with the 1st.

Experimental groups received diets containing canola oil (HF + CNO) and fish oil (HF + FO) as a source of ALA and EPA + DHA respectively. After 60 days of feeding rats with their respective diets, OS and inflammatory markers in serum were assessed. Dyslipidemia caused significant (p < 0.05) increase in OS (lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide, and protein carbonyl), pro-inflammatory cytokine (CRP, IL-1β, MCP-1, and TNF-α), and eicosanoid (PGE, LTB, and LTC) level in serum of both young and aged rats. Aged dyslipidemic rats presented significantly (p < 0.05) higher level of these markers compared to young dyslipidemic rats. Hyperglycemia onset further augmented OS and inflammatory markers in young dyslipidemic rats significantly (p < 0.05). Administration of n-3 fatty acids downregulated the serum markers of OS and inflammation in all the three experimental models. Thus, aging and hyperglycemia onset intensified dyslipidemia-induced OS and inflammation.

To study the impact of RYGB on the dietary ingestion and plasma concentration of PUFAs and on the intestinal expression of genes involved in their endogenous biosynthesis in severely obese women with type 2 .Before, and 3 and 12 months after RYGB, obese women (n = 20) self-reported a seven-day dietary record, answered a food frequency query and provided plasma samples for  (ALA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA), docosahexaenoic (DHA) and arachidonic (ARA)  assessment by gas chromatography. Intestinal biopsies (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) were collected through double-balloon endoscopy before and 3 months after RYGB for gene expression analysis by microarray (Human GeneChip 1.0 ST array) and RT-qPCR validation.Compared to the preoperative period, patients had decreased intakes of PUFAs, fish and soybean oil (p < 0.05) and lower plasma concentrations of ALA and EPA (p < 0.001) 3 and 12 months after RYGB. FADS1 gene expression was lower in duodenum (RT-qPCR fold change = -1.620, p < 0.05) and jejunum (RT-qPCR fold change = -1.549, p < 0.05) 3 months following RYGB, compared to before surgery.RYGB decreased PUFA ingestion, plasma ALA and EPA levels, and intestinal expression of FADS1 gene. The latter encodes a key enzyme involved in endogenous biosynthesis of PUFAs. These data suggest that supplementation of omega-3 PUFAs may be required for obese patients undergoing RYGB.

The simple anthropometric measure of body mass index does not always reflect the biological effects of excessive body fat on health, thus additional molecular characterizations of obese phenotypes are needed to assess the risk of developing subsequent metabolic conditions at an individual level.To better understand the associations of free fatty acids (FFAs) with metabolic phenotypes of obesity, we applied a targeted metabolomics approach to measure 40 serum FFAs from 452 individuals who participated in four independent studies, using an ultra-performance liquid chromatograph coupled to a Xevo G2 quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometer.FFA levels were significantly elevated in overweight/obese subjects with  compared to their healthy counterparts. We identified a group of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) that are closely correlated with metabolic status in two groups of obese individuals who underwent weight loss intervention and can predict the recurrence of  at two years after metabolic surgery. Two UFAs, dihomo-gamma- and palmitoleic , were also able to predict the future development of metabolic syndrome (MS) in a group of obese subjects.These findings underscore the potential role of UFAs in the MS pathogenesis and also as important markers in predicting the risk of developing  in obese individuals or  remission after a metabolic surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28336102>Influence of gestational  on fatty  concentrations in human colostrum.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to examine differences in fatty  concentrations in colostrum of women with and without gestational  (GDM). The effect of GDM on fatty  composition of colostrum is not fully understood, although rates of GDM are increasing globally.A prospective case-control study was conducted of postpartum women with and without GDM. Gas chromatographic analysis was conducted to examine differences in colostral fatty acids of the colostrum samples of 29 women with and 34 without GDM.Analyses of the fatty  composition revealed significantly higher concentrations of four essential ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids-γ-, eicosatrienoic, arachidonic, and docosatetraenoic-in the colostrum of GDM women compared with non-GDM women. Timing of collection influenced saturated medium chain fatty  and monounsaturated fatty  levels.Differences in concentrations of ω-6 fatty acids but not in dietary linoleic fatty  or ω-3 fatty acids suggest that altered concentrations are attributed to changes in specific endogenous metabolic pathways. Implications of higher concentrations of ω-6 fatty acids in the colostrum of women with GDM have yet to be determined. Timing of colostrum collection is critical in determining colostral fatty  and metabolite concentrations.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In total, 71 334 women without  at baseline were followed up from 1993 to 2011.  was identified using questionnaires and drug-reimbursement claims, and incident cases were validated. FA consumption in 1993 was estimated from a validated dietary questionnaire. Cox regression estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % CI of  risk, comparing the upper tertile group with the lowest. High n-3 PUFA consumption was associated with T2D even after adjustment for confounders, including other FA and BMI (HR 1·26; 95 % CI 1·13, 1·41; upper tertile compared with lowest). Upon stratification by overweight (BMI≥25 kg/m2)/non-overweight, a positive association between total PUFA consumption and T2D was observed, but it was restricted to non-overweight women (HR 1·22; 95 % CI 1·05, 1·42), whereas n-3 PUFA consumption was associated with increased T2D risk in both BMI strata (BMI<25 kg/m2: HR 1·19; 95 % CI 1·01, 1·40 and BMI≥25 kg/m2: HR 1·38; 95 % CI 1·20, 1·59). Within the n-3 PUFA, high DPA (HR 1·41; 95 % CI 1·23, 1·63) and α- (ALA) intakes were associated with increased T2D risk, but the effects of ALA were restricted to overweight women (HR 1·17; 95 % CI 1·01, 1·36). Within the n-6 PUFA, only arachidonic  (AA) intake was associated with T2D risk (HR 1·49; 95 % CI 1·33, 1·66). The associations with DPA and AA persisted even after adjustment of their principal source in this cohort, the consumption of meat. The effects of PUFA are heterogeneous within the FA group.

The association of a combination of fatty acids with incident type 2  (T2D) has not been evaluated.We measured plasma phospholipid fatty acids by gas chromatography in 27,296 adults, including 12,132 incident cases of T2D, over the follow-up period between baseline (1991-1998) and 31 December 2007 in 8 European countries in EPIC-InterAct, a nested case-cohort study. The first principal component derived by principal component analysis of 27 individual fatty acids (mole percentage) was the main exposure (subsequently called the fatty  pattern score [FA-pattern score]). The FA-pattern score was partly characterised by high concentrations of linoleic , stearic , odd-chain fatty acids, and very-long-chain saturated fatty acids and low concentrations of γ-, palmitic , and long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids, and it explained 16.1% of the overall variability of the 27 fatty acids. Based on country-specific Prentice-weighted Cox regression and random-effects meta-analysis, the FA-pattern score was associated with lower incident T2D. Comparing the top to the bottom fifth of the score, the hazard ratio of incident T2D was 0.23 (95% CI 0.19-0.29) adjusted for potential confounders and 0.37 (95% CI 0.27-0.50) further adjusted for metabolic risk factors. The association changed little after adjustment for individual fatty acids or fatty  subclasses. In cross-sectional analyses relating the FA-pattern score to metabolic, genetic, and dietary factors, the FA-pattern score was inversely associated with adiposity, triglycerides, liver enzymes, C-reactive protein, a genetic score representing insulin resistance, and dietary intakes of soft drinks and alcohol and was positively associated with high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and intakes of polyunsaturated fat, dietary fibre, and coffee (p < 0.05 each). Limitations include potential measurement error in the fatty acids and other model covariates and possible residual confounding.A combination of individual fatty acids, characterised by high concentrations of linoleic , odd-chain fatty acids, and very long-chain fatty acids, was associated with lower incidence of T2D.

Regulation of lipid metabolism is crucial in the improvement of type 2  and obesity associated symptoms. The role of CaMKII in membrane associated lipid metabolism was the focus of this study. Five to six weeks old male Wistar rats were used in this study. GC×GC-TOFMS technique was used to determine the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (linoleic , arachidonic  and 11,14-eicosadienoic ). Carnitine palmitoyltransferase (Cpt-1) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc-1) genes expression were assessed using quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). From the results, CaMKII activation by exercise increased the levels of arachidonic  and 11,14-eicosadienoic  while a decrease in the level of  was observed in the skeletal muscle. The results indicated that exercise-induced CaMKII activation increased CPT-1 expression and decreased ACC-1 expression in rat skeletal muscle. All the observed increases with activation of CaMKII by exercise were aborted when KN93, an inhibitor of CaMKII was injected in exercising rats. This study demonstrated that CaMKII activation by exercise regulated lipid metabolism. This study suggests that CaMKII can be a vital target of therapeutic approach in the management of diseases such as type 2  and obesity that have increased to epidemic proportions recently.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27796616>Human Milk Fatty  Composition: Comparison of Novel Dried Milk Spot Versus Standard Liquid Extraction Methods.</a></h2><p>Accurate assessment of the long chain polyunsaturated fatty  (LC-PUFA) content of human milk (HM) provides a powerful means to evaluate the FA nutrient status of breastfed infants. The conventional standard for FA composition analysis of HM is liquid extraction, trans-methylation, and analyte detection resolved by gas chromatography. This standard approach requires fresh or frozen samples, storage in deep freeze, organic solvents, and specialized equipment in processing and analysis. Further, HM collection is often impractical for many studies in the free living environment, particularly for studies in developing countries. In the present study, we compare a novel and more practical approach to sample collection and processing that involves the spotting and drying ~50 μL of HM on a specialized paper stored and transported at ambient temperatures until analysis. Deming regression indicated the two methods aligned very well for all LC-PUFA and the abundant HM FA. Additionally, strong correlations (r > 0.85) were observed for DHA, ARA, EPA, linoleic (LA), and  acids (ALA), which are of particular interest to the health of the developing infant. Taken together, our data suggest this more practical and inexpensive method of collection, storage, and transport of HM milk samples could dramatically facilitate studies of HM, as well as understanding its lipid composition influences on human health and development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29298969>[Dietetary recommendation for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease].</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is currently the most common chronic liver disease in the developed world. Nowadays, in the adult population of Europe it is estimated at 14% to 21%. Its most important risk factors are obesity and metabolic syndrome. Introducing lifestyle changes such as: dietary intervention and increased physical activity are the first-line treatment and are intended to support not only NAFLD but also associated diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance,  and dyslipidemia. Dietary management focuses on weight reduction of overweight or obese people by decreasing energy in diet. It is recommended to limit the intake of saturated fats and trans fatty acids as well as cholesterol. Instead, it is important to increase the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty  diets, mainly from the n-3 family, which exhibit anti-inflammatory activity. It is also beneficial to eat nuts, despite their high energy value, as a source of , which lowers LDL cholesterol. It is important to increase the share of vegetable protein (eg. soya) and limit the intake of fat meat, milk and the dairy products. A key role in the treatment and prevention of NAFLD is also a reduction of simple sugars and total exclusion of added sugar in the diet. The rise of NAFLD in developed countries is analogous to the increase of fructose consumption, which high intake is directly indicated as the main cause of the disease. Choosing foods with high fiber content, low glycemic index and meals composed with low glycemic load, is conducive to weight reduction. An important role in supporting NAFLD treatment is also attributed to vitamin D, C and E supplementation and some probiotic bacteria, as well as cinnamon and turmeric, which improve insulin sensitivity. Daily physical activity is strongly recommended as the supplement of healthy lifestyle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109059>Maternal Omega-3 Nutrition, Placental Transfer and Fetal Brain Development in Gestational  and Preeclampsia.</a></h2><p>Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic fatty  (DHA), are widely recognized to impact fetal and infant neurodevelopment. The impact of DHA on brain development, and its inefficient synthesis from the essential  (ALA), has led to recommended DHA intakes of 250-375 mg eicosapentaenoic  + DHA/day for pregnant and lactating women by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Despite these recommendations, the intake of omega-3s in women of child-bearing age in the US remains very low. The low maternal status of DHA prior to pregnancy could impair fetal neurodevelopment. This review focuses on maternal omega-3 status in conditions of gestational  (GDM) and preeclampsia, and the subsequent impact on placental transfer and cord blood concentration of omega-3s. Both GDM and preeclampsia are associated with altered maternal omega-3 status, altered placental omega-3 metabolism, reduced cord blood omega-3 levels and have an impact on neurodevelopment in the infant and on brain health later in life. These findings indicate lower DHA exposure of the developing baby may be driven by lower placental transfer in both conditions. Thus, determining approaches which facilitate increased delivery of DHA during pregnancy and early development might positively impact brain development in infants born to mothers with these diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27009754>Serum n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, Δ5- and Δ6-desaturase activities, and risk of incident type 2  in men: the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study.</a></h2><p>The role of n-6 (ω-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in type 2  (T2D) is inconclusive. In addition, little is known about how factors involved in PUFA metabolism, such as zinc, may affect the associations.We investigated the associations of serum n-6 PUFAs and activities of enzymes involved in PUFA metabolism, Δ5 desaturase (D5D) and Δ6 desaturase (D6D), with T2D risk to determine whether serum zinc concentrations could modify these associations.The study included 2189 men from the prospective Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study, aged 42-60 y and free of T2D at baseline in 1984-1989. T2D was assessed by self-administered questionnaires, by fasting and 2-h oral-glucose-tolerance test blood glucose measurement at re-examination rounds 4, 11, and 20 y after baseline, and by record linkage to the hospital discharge registry and the reimbursement register on  medication expenses. Multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze associations.During the average follow-up of 19.3 y, 417 men developed T2D. Those with higher estimated D5D activity (extreme-quartile HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.74; P-trend < 0.001) and higher concentrations of total n-6 PUFAs (HR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.73; P-trend < 0.001), linoleic  (LA; HR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.70; P-trend < 0.001), and arachidonic  (AA; HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.85; P-trend = 0.007) had a lower risk and those with higher concentrations of γ- (GLA; HR: 1.28; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.68; P = 0.021) and dihomo-γ- (DGLA; HR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.84; P-trend = 0.005) and higher D6D activity had a higher (HR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.14, 1.97; P-trend < 0.001) multivariate-adjusted risk of T2D. Zinc mainly modified the association with GLA on T2D risk, with a higher risk observed among those with serum zinc concentrations above the median (P-interaction = 0.04).Higher serum total n-6 PUFA, LA, and AA concentrations and estimated D5D activity were associated with a lower risk of incident T2D, and higher GLA and DGLA concentrations and estimated D6D activity were associated with a higher risk. In addition, a higher serum zinc concentration modified the association of GLA on the risk of T2D.© 2016 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28651693>Fatty  and lipid profiles in primary human trophoblast over 90h in culture.</a></h2><p>Little is known about the mechanisms underlying the preferential transport of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) to the fetus by the syncytiotrophoblast and the role of cytotrophoblasts in placental lipid metabolism and transport. We studied primary human trophoblast (PHT) cells cultured for 90h to determine the fatty  and lipid composition of cytotrophoblast (18h culture) and syncytiotrophoblast (90h culture) cells. In cultured PHT total lipid fatty acids were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced at 90h compared to 18h in culture including lower levels of palmitic  (PA, 16:0, -37%), palmitoleic  (POA, 16:1n-7, -30%), oleic  (OA, 18:1n-9, -31%), LCPUFA arachidonic  (AA, 20:4n-6, -28%) and α- (ALA, 18:3n-3, -55%). In major lipid classes, OA and most of the n-3 and n-6 LCPUFA were markedly lower at 90h in TG (-57 to -76%; p < 0.05). In the cellular NEFA, n-6 LCPUFA, dihomo-γ- (DGLA, 20:3n-6) and AA were both reduced by -51% and DHA was -55% lower (p < 0.05) at 90h. In contrast, phospholipid FA content did not change between cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblast except for OA, which decreased by -62% (p < 0.05). Decreasing PHT TG and NEFA lipid content at 90h in culture is likely due to processes related to differentiation such as alterations in lipase activity that occur as cytotrophoblast cells differentiate. We speculate that syncytiotrophoblast prioritizes PL containing AA and DHA for transfer to the fetus by mobilizing FA from storage lipids.Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28185855>Biphasic effect of  on glucose-induced dysmorphogenesis and lipoperoxidation in whole rat embryo in culture.</a></h2><p>Type 1  complicated with pregnancy, know as diabetic embryopathy, is the cause of neonatal malformations and low for gestational age neonates. With the use of the whole-embryo culture system, it has been demonstrated that high glucose causes embryo dysmorphogenesis, and that oxidative stress appears to be the main mechanism. In recent years, beneficial effect of omega-3 fatty acids has been demonstrated in various diabetic models, and in diabetic complications. Since diabetic embryopathy is mediated probably through membrane lipoperoxidation, This study was designed to find if omega-3 fatty acids could ameliorate the effect of high glucose over the dysmorphogenesis of whole rat embryo in culture. Postimplantational rat embryos were cultured in hyperglycemic media, with addition of , and morphologic and morphometric parameters were registered. Also, lipoperoxidation and fatty acids composition were measured in cultured embryos. Growth of embryos cultured in presence of glucose was very affected, whereas lipoperoxidation was increased, and it was found that Triton X-100 causes similar results than glucose. Addition of low micromolar doses of  overcome the effect of high glucose or Triton X-100, but higher doses does not ameliorates the effects of the carbohydrate or the detergent. Paradoxically, there are not significant changes in fatty acids composition, although the U/S fatty acids ratio shows an increasing tendency by high glucose and a normalizing tendency by omega-3 fatty acids. In conclusion, glucose and Triton X-100 induces in vitro dysmorphogenesis in post-implantational rat embryos associated with increased lipoperoxidation; and this nocive effect could be ameliorated by low micromolar doses of ALA.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Importantly, data among pregnant women are scarce. We investigated individual plasma phospholipid n-3 and n-6 PUFAs in early to midpregnancy in relation to subsequent risk of gestational  (GDM).Within the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Fetal Growth Studies-Singleton Cohort (n = 2,802), individual plasma phospholipid n-3 and n-6 PUFAs levels were measured at gestational weeks (GWs) 10-14, 15-26, 23-31, and 33-39 among 107 GDM cases (ascertained on average at GW 27) and 214 non-GDM controls. Conditional logistic regression was used, adjusting for major risk factors for GDM. After adjusting for covariates, individual n-3 eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) were inversely correlated with insulin-resistance markers, whereas individual n-6 dihomo-gamma- (DGLA) was positively correlated with insulin-resistance markers. At GW 15-26, a standard deviation (SD) increase in total n-3 PUFAs and individual n-3 DPA was associated with a 36% (adjusted odds ratio 0.64; 95% CI 0.42-0.96; P = 0.042) and 33% (0.67; 95% CI 0.45-0.99; P = 0.047) lower risk of GDM, respectively; however, the significance did not persist after post hoc false-discovery rate (FDR) correction (FDR-corrected P values > 0.05). Associations between total n-6 PUFAs and GDM were null, whereas associations with individual n-6 PUFAs were differential. Per SD increase, gamma- (GLA) at GWs 10-14 and DGLA at GWs 10-14 and 15-26 were significantly associated with a 1.40- to 1.95-fold higher risk of GDM, whereas docosatetraenoic  (DTA) at GW 15-26 was associated with a 45% (0.55; 95% CI 0.37-0.83) lower risk of GDM (all FDR-corrected P values < 0.05). Null associations were observed for linoleic  (LA) in either gestational window in relation to risk of GDM. Women with high (≥median) n-3 PUFAs and low (<median) n-6 PUFAs levels had a 64% (95% CI 0.14-0.95; P value = 0.039) lower risk of GDM versus women with low n-3 and high n-6 PUFAs. Limitations include the inability to distinguish between exogenous and endogenous influences on circulating PUFA levels and the lack of causality inherent in observational studies.Our findings may suggest a potential role of primarily endogenously metabolized plasma phospholipid n-6 PUFAs including GLA, DGLA, and DTA in early to midpregnancy in the development of GDM. Null findings on primarily diet-derived n-3 EPA and DHA and n-6 LA do not provide strong evidence to suggest a beneficial role in prevention of GDM, although not excluding the potential benefit of EPA and DHA on glucose-insulin homeostasis given the inverse associations with insulin-resistance markers. Our findings highlight the importance of assessing individual circulating PUFAs to investigate their distinct pathophysiologic roles in glucose homeostasis in pregnancy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26189725>Hydroxytyrosol Inhibits Cannabinoid CB1 Receptor Gene Expression in 3T3-L1 Preadipocyte Cell Line.</a></h2><p>The 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line is a well characterized cell model for studying the adipocyte status and the molecular mechanisms involved in differentiation of these cells. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes have the ability to synthesize and degrade endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) and their differentiation into adipocytes increases the expression of cannabinoid (CB1) and PPAR-γ receptors. Clinically, the blocking stimulation of the endocannabinoid pathway has been one of the first approaches proposed to counteract the obesity and obesity-associated diseases (such as , metabolic syndrome and cancer). In this connection, here we studied in cultured 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes the effects of n-3-PUFA, α- (OM-3), n-6-PUFA, Linoleic  (OM-6), and hydroxytyrosol (HT) on the expression of CB1 receptor gene and the adipogenesis-related genes PPAR-γ, Fatty  Synthase (FAS) and Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL). HT was able to inhibit 3T3-L1 cell differentiation by down-regulating cell proliferation and CB1 receptor gene expression. HT exhibited anti-adipogenic effects, whereas OM-3 and OM-6 exerted an inhibitory action on cell proliferation associated with an induction of the preadipocytes differentiation and CB1 receptor gene expression. Moreover, the expression of FAS and LPL genes resulted increased after treatment with both HT and OM-3 and OM-6. The present study points out that the intake of molecules such as HT, contained in extra virgin olive oil, may be considered also in view of antiobesity and antineoplastic properties by acting directly on the adipose tissue and modulating CB1 receptor gene transcription.© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27165261>Dietary Black Raspberry Seed Oil Ameliorates Inflammatory Activities in db/db Mice.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the status of the markers related to inflammation in db/db mice fed black raspberry seed (BRS) oil, which is rich in α-.

Long-chain polyunsaturated FAs (LC-PUFAs) are pivotal in brain and visual development. It is of interest to investigate whether and how specific pregnancy conditions, which alter fatty  metabolism (excessive pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) or gestational weight gain (GWG)), affect lipid supply to the foetus. For this purpose, we evaluated the erythrocyte FAs of mothers and offspring (cord-blood) at birth, in relation to pre-pregnancy BMI and GWG. A total of 435 mothers and their offspring (237 males, 51%) were included in the study. Distribution of linoleic  (LA) and α- (ALA), and their metabolites, arachidonic , dihomogamma linoleic (DGLA) and ecosapentanoic , was significantly different in maternal and foetal erythrocytes. Pre-pregnancy BMI was significantly associated with maternal percentage of MUFAs (Coeff: -0.112; p = 0.021), LA (Coeff: -0.033; p = 0.044) and DHA (Coeff. = 0.055; p = 0.0016); inadequate GWG with DPA (Coeff: 0.637; p = 0.001); excessive GWG with docosaexahenoic  (DHA) (Coeff. = -0.714; p = 0.004). Moreover, pre-pregnancy BMI was associated with foetus percentage of PUFAs (Coeff: -0.172; p = 0.009), omega 6 (Coeff: -0.098; p = 0.015) and DHA (Coeff: -0.0285; p = 0.036), even after adjusting for maternal lipids. Our findings show that maternal GWG affects maternal but not foetal lipid profile, differently from pre-pregnancy BMI, which influences both.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26270516>[The importance of γ- in the prevention and treatment].</a></h2><p>The etiology of diet-related disorders is closely associated with dietary factors. A special role is attributed to intake of fat and fatty  profile, both quantitative and qualitative. For prevention and treatment of the abovementioned diseases a proper supply of unsaturated fatty acids plays a significant role, because of their particular importance to health. γ- (GLA), with three double bonds in the carbon chain, also known as all-cis 6,9,12-octadecatrienoic , belongs to the n-6 family of fatty acids. It plays biologically important functions in the human body, such as being a substrate for eicosanoids synthesis, involvement in the transport and oxidation of cholesterol, and being one of the components of lipid membrane. Its inadequate dietary intake or impaired formation is the cause of many inflammatory and degenerative diseases. A rich source of this fatty  is vegetable oils, until recently used mainly in folk medicine. Nowadays, studies conducted both in animal models and in humans suggest its health-promoting properties in the prevention and treatment of atopic dermatitis, cardiovascular diseases, , cancers and rheumatoid arthritis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28566642>Modulatory Effect of an Isolated Triglyceride from Fenugreek Seed Oil on of α-Amylase, Lipase and ACE Activities, Liver-Kidney Functions and Metabolic Disorders of Diabetic Rats.</a></h2><p>This study was designed to examine physicochemical characteristics, chemical compositions and biological activities of fenugreek seed oil (FSO) and its pure triglyceride (TG). One fenugreek TG was purified using a bioassay-guided fractionation and administrated to surviving diabetic rats. The free fatty acids percentage as well as, the peroxide, the saponification and the iodine values were 2%, 12 mequiv. O/kg of oil, 189 (mg KOH/g) and 110 (g/100 g of oil), respectively.  (C 26.14%), Linoleic  (C 41.13%) and Oleic  (C 17.07%) were the dominant fatty acids in the FSO. β-sitosterol was the major sterol (85.3%) in the FSO. LnLnO (17.1%), LLL (16.6%), OLL and OOLn (8.4%), were the abundant triglycerides. The hexane extract of fenugreek seed (exhibiting the powerful inhibitory activity against alpha-amylase) was purified using a bioassay-guided fractionation affording one fenugreek TG: (11Z)-11- eicosenoic  2, 3- bis[((9Z, 12Z, 15Z)-1-oxo-9, 12, 15-octadecatrien-1-yl)oxy] propyl ester. In diabetic rats, the administration of the fenugreek TG inhibited α-amylase activity in small intestine by 36% as compared to untreated diabetic rats. Moreover, fenugreek TG increased insulin sensibility which leads to decrease in blood glucose level by 43%. In addition, this study demonstrated that administration of pure fenugreek TG to diabetic rats ameliorated the glycogen rate in liver and muscle. In addition, the administration of fenugreek TG reverted back the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme respectively in kidney and plasma by 33 and 29%. Interestingly, the fenugreek TG inhibited lipase activity in small intestine by 33% which leads to the regulation of lipid profile. Moreover, the fenugreek TG protected liver-kidney function evidenced by histological study. In conclusion, our finding demonstrates that the administration of fenugreek TG to diabetic rats can make it a potential candidate for industrial application as a pharmacological agent for the treatment of hyperglycemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31485451>Effect of Early and Late Interventions with Dietary Oils on Vascular and Neural Complications in a Type 2 Diabetic Rat Model.</a></h2><p>Determine the effect of dietary oils enriched in different mono- or polyunsaturated fatty acids, i.e., olive oil (18 : 1, oleic ), safflower oil (18 : 2 n-6, linoleic ), flaxseed oil (18 : 3 n-3, ), evening primrose oil (18 : 3 n-6, gamma ), or menhaden oil (20:5/22 : 6 n-3 eicosapentaenoic/docosahexaenoic acids), on vascular and neural complications in high-fat-fed low-dose streptozotocin-treated Sprague-Dawley rats, an animal model for late-stage type 2 .Rats were fed a high-fat diet (45% kcal as fat primarily derived from lard) for 8 weeks and then treated with a low dose of streptozotocin (30 mg/kg) in order to induce hyperglycemia. After an additional 8 (early intervention) or 20 (late intervention) weeks, the different groups of rats were fed diets with 1/2 of the kcal of fat derived from lard replaced by the different dietary oils. In addition, a control group fed a standard diet (4.25% kcal as fat) and a diabetic group maintained on the high-fat diet were maintained. The treatment period was approximately 16 weeks. The endpoints evaluated included vascular reactivity of epineurial arterioles, motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity, thermal and corneal sensitivity, and innervation of sensory nerves in the cornea and skin.Our findings show that menhaden and flaxseed oil provided the greatest benefit for correcting peripheral nerve damage caused by , whereas enriching the high-fat diet with menhaden oil provided the most benefit to acetylcholine-mediated vascular relaxation of epineurial arterioles of the sciatic nerve. Enriching the diets with fatty acids derived from the other oils provided none to partial improvements.These studies imply that long-chain n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids could be an effective treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathy with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids derived from fish oil being the most effective.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26571451>Omega 6 fatty acids for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.</a></h2><p>Omega 6 plays a vital role in many physiological functions but there is controversy concerning its effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. There is conflicting evidence whether increasing or decreasing omega 6 intake results in beneficial effects.The two primary objectives of this Cochrane review were to determine the effectiveness of:1. Increasing omega 6 (Linoleic  (LA), Gamma- (GLA), Dihomo-gamma- (DGLA), Arachidonic  (AA), or any combination) intake in place of saturated or monounsaturated fats or carbohydrates for the primary prevention of CVD.2. Decreasing omega 6 (LA, GLA, DGLA, AA, or any combination) intake in place of carbohydrates or protein (or both) for the primary prevention of CVD.We searched the following electronic databases up to 23 September 2014: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on the Cochrane Library (Issue 8 of 12, 2014); MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to September week 2, 2014); EMBASE Classic and EMBASE (Ovid) (1947 to September 2014); Web of Science Core Collection (Thomson Reuters) (1990 to September 2014); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and Health Technology Assessment Database, and Health Economics Evaluations Database on the Cochrane Library (Issue 3 of 4, 2014). We searched trial registers and reference lists of reviews for further studies. We applied no language restrictions.Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions stating an intention to increase or decrease omega 6 fatty acids, lasting at least six months, and including healthy adults or adults at high risk of CVD. The comparison group was given no advice, no supplementation, a placebo, a control diet, or continued with their usual diet. The outcomes of interest were CVD clinical events (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal end points) and CVD risk factors (changes in blood pressure, changes in blood lipids, occurrence of type 2 ). We excluded trials involving exercise or multifactorial interventions to avoid confounding.Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included trials.We included four RCTs (five papers) that randomised 660 participants. No ongoing trials were identified. All included trials had at least one domain with an unclear risk of bias. There were no RCTs of omega 6 intake reporting CVD clinical events. Three trials investigated the effect of increased omega 6 intake on lipid levels (total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL-cholesterol), and high density lipoprotein (HDL-cholesterol)), two trials reported triglycerides, and two trials reported blood pressure (diastolic and systolic blood pressure). Two trials, one with two relevant intervention arms, investigated the effect of decreased omega 6 intake on blood pressure parameters and lipid levels (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and HDL-cholesterol) and one trial reported triglycerides. Our analyses found no statistically significant effects of either increased or decreased omega 6 intake on CVD risk factors.Two studies were supported by funding from the UK Food Standards Agency and Medical Research Council. One study was supported by Lipid Nutrition, a commercial company in the Netherlands and the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs. The final study was supported by grants from the Finnish Food Research Foundation, Finnish Heart Research Foundation, Aarne and Aili Turnen Foundation, and the Research Council for Health, Academy of Finland.We found no studies examining the effects of either increased or decreased omega 6 on our primary outcome CVD clinical endpoints and insufficient evidence to show an effect of increased or decreased omega 6 intake on CVD risk factors such as blood lipids and blood pressure. Very few trials were identified with a relatively small number of participants randomised. There is a need for larger well conducted RCTs assessing cardiovascular events as well as cardiovascular risk factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28802571>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids improve endothelial function in humans at risk for atherosclerosis: A review.</a></h2><p>Epidemiology studies and clinical trials show that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) can prevent atherosclerotic morbidity and evidence suggests this may be mediated by improving endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by reduced vasodilation and a pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic state, and is an early pathological event in the development of atherosclerosis. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD), a gold standard for assessing endothelial dysfunction, is a predictor of future cardiovascular events and coronary heart disease risk. Notably, risk factors for endothelial dysfunction include classic risk factors for atherosclerosis: Elevated lipids, , hypertension, elevated BMI, cigarette smoking, and metabolic syndrome. In this paper, we review the ability of n-3 PUFAs to improve endothelial dysfunction in individuals with classic risk factors for atherosclerosis, but lacking diagnosed atherosclerotic disease, with the goal of identifying those individuals that might gain the most vasoprotection from n-3 PUFA supplements. We include trials using eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), or  (ALA) alone, or EPA+DHA; and assessing endothelial function by FMD, forearm blood flow, or peripheral arterial tonometry. We found that n-3 PUFAs improved endothelial dysfunction in 16 of 17 studies in individuals with hyperlipidemia, elevated BMI, metabolic syndrome, or that smoked cigarettes, but only in 2 of 5 studies in diabetics. Further, these trials showed that use of EPA+DHA consistently improve endothelial dysfunction; ALA-enriched diets appear promising; but use of EPA or DHA alone requires further study. We conclude that individuals with hyperlipidemia, elevated BMI, metabolic syndrome, or that smoke could derive vaosprotective benefits from EPA+DHA supplementation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Fasting blood samples were obtained at each visit and plasma phospholipid n-6 PUFAs were measured, which included linoleic  (LA), dihomo-γ- (DGLA) and arachidonic  (AA); n-3 PUFAs included α- (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). Estimated D5D and D6D were calculated as FA product-to-precursor ratios, where D5D=AA/DGLA and D6D=DGLA/LA. To examine the longitudinal relationships between long chain PUFAs, desaturase activities and fasting plasma lipids in youth with T1D mixed effects models were used for each individual PUFAs, D5D and D6D, adjusted for demographics, clinic site,  duration, insulin regimen, insulin dose/kg, HbA1c, insulin sensitivity score, and body mass index with random effects to account for the repeated measurements.Favorable lipid associations were found between LA and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (β=-0.58, p<0.05); AA, plasma triglycerides (TG) (β=-0.04, p<0.05) and TG/high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-C ratio (β=-0.04, p<0.05); and D5D, plasma TG (β=-0.2, p<0.05) and TG/HDL-cholesterol ratio (β=-0.23, p<0.05). Findings were mixed for the n-3 PUFAs and DGLA: ALA was positively associated with plasma TG (β=0.33, p<0.05) and HDL cholesterol (β=9.86, p<0.05); EPA was positively associated with total cholesterol (β=8.17, p<0.05), LDL cholesterol (β=5.74, p<0.01) and HDL cholesterol (β=2.27, p<0.01); and DGLA was positively associated with TG/HDL-cholesterol ratio (β=0.05, P<0.05).Findings suggest that the most abundant PUFA, LA as well as its metabolic bi-product AA, may be important targets for CVD lipid risk factor reduction in youth with T1D.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The results showed that BBPs have high dietary fiber (57.46%), carbohydrate (18.93%) and protein (13.81%) content versus low fat content (<1%) contributing to a low energy value of 139.24 kcal per 100 g. Profiling of fatty acids showed an abundance of the essential polyunsaturated α- and linoleic acids, exhibiting an excellent nutritional quality as revealed by their low atherogenic and thrombogenic indices and their hypocholesterolemic properties. The methanol extract which exhibited the highest total phenolic, flavonoid and tannin contents was found to be the most active extract in terms of antimicrobial and anti-radical activities. In alloxan-induced diabetic mice, the oral administration of a methanol extract (500 mg per kg bw) attenuated the elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase activities, and urea, uric , and creatinine. It effectively normalized the status of lipid profiles, mitigated oxidative stress through the activation of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, GPx and SOD), and alleviated oxidative stress-mediated histopathological changes in the pancreas, liver, kidney and testis. Compositional analysis by HPLC-PDA-ESI-MS/MS revealed the presence of flavan-3-ols (catechin, epicatechin and their derivatives), flavones (apigenin derivatives) and flavonols (glycosides of quercetin and kaempferol), among others.

However, concentrations of individual serum FFAs have never been published in terms of their relationship (correlation) to homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and percent remaining β-cell function (HOMA-%β) in the type 2 diabetics (T2Ds).  consumption has a negative correlation with the insulin resistance, which in turn is negatively correlated with the remaining β-cell function. The primary objective was to test the hypothesis that there would be different relationship (correlation) between the blood serum individual free FFA mol % levels and HOMA-IR and/or HOMA-%β in T2D. The secondary objective was to test the hypothesis that flaxseed oil, previously being shown to be ineffective in the glycemic control in T2Ds, may alter these correlations in a statistically significant manner as well as HOMA-IR and/or HOMA-%β.Patients were recruited via a newspaper advertisement and two physicians have been employed. All the patients came to visit one and three months later for a second visit. At the second visit, the subjects were randomly assigned (double blind) to flaxseed or safflower oil treatment for three months, until the third visit.Different statistically significant correlations or trends towards among some serum individual free FFA mol % levels and HOMA-IR and HOMA-%β, pre- and post-flaxseed and safflower oil supplementation were found. However, flaxseed oil had no impact on HOMA-IR or HOMA-%β despite statistically significant alterations in correlations compared to baseline HOMA-IR.The obtained data indicate that high doses of flaxseed oil have no statistically significant effect on HOMA-IR or HOMA-%β in T2Ds, probably due to the additive effects of negative and positive correlations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29566193>Serum n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and risk of death: the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study.</a></h2><p>The cardioprotective properties of linoleic  (LA), a major n-6 (ω-6) polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), have been recognized, but less is known about its associations with other causes of death. Relatively little is also known about how the minor n-6 PUFAs-γ- (GLA), dihomo-γ- (DGLA), and arachidonic  (AA)-relate to mortality risk.We investigated the associations of serum n-6 PUFAs, an objective biomarker of exposure, with risk of death in middle-aged and older men and whether disease history modifies the associations.We included 2480 men from the prospective Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study, aged 42-60 y at baseline in 1984-1989. The stratified analyses by baseline disease status included 1019 men with a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, or  and 1461 men without a history of disease.During the mean follow-up of 22.4 y, 1143 deaths due to disease occurred. Of these, 575 were CVD deaths, 317 were cancer deaths, and 251 were other-cause deaths. A higher serum LA concentration was associated with a lower risk of death from any cause (multivariable-adjusted HR for the highest compared with the lowest quintile: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.71; P-trend < 0.001) and with deaths due to CVD (extreme-quintile HR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.74; P-trend < 0.001) and non-CVD or noncancer causes (HR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.76; P-trend = 0.001). Serum AA had similar, although weaker, inverse associations. Serum GLA and DGLA were not associated with risk of death, and none of the fatty acids were associated with cancer mortality. The results were generally similar among those with or without a history of major chronic disease (P-interaction > 0.13).Our findings showed an inverse association of a higher biomarker of LA intake with total and CVD mortality and little concern for risk, thus supporting the current dietary recommendations to increase LA intake for CVD prevention. The finding of an inverse association of serum AA with the risk of death needs replication in other populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129605>Creation of a database to assess effects of omega-3, omega-6 and total polyunsaturated fats on health: methodology for a set of systematic reviews.</a></h2><p>To create a database of long-term randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing higher with lower omega-3, omega-6 or total polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), regardless of reported outcomes, and to develop methods to assess effects of increasing omega-6,  (ALA), long-chain omega-3 (LCn3) and total PUFA on health outcomes.Systematic review search, methodology and meta-analyses.Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Clinicaltrials.gov and trials in relevant systematic reviews.RCTs of ≥24 weeks' duration assessing effects of increasing ALA, LCn3, omega-6 or total PUFAs, regardless of outcomes reported.Methods included random-effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses.

High SFA intakes have been associated with increased CVD and type-2  (T2D) risk, due to alterations in cholesterol homoeostasis and adipose tissue inflammation. PUFA, in particular EPA and DHA, have been associated with health benefits, including anti-inflammatory effects. It is well established that dietary fat composition plays an important role in biological processes. A recent review of evidence suggests that replacement of SFA with PUFA has potential to reduce risk of CVD and T2D. The public health and molecular impact of EPA and DHA have been well-characterised, while less is known of effects of α- (ALA). The current dietary guideline for ALA is 0·5% TE; however evidence from supplementation trials suggests that benefit is observed at levels greater than 2 g/d (0·6-1% TE). This review highlights the gap in the evidence base relating to effects of the replacement of SFA with ALA, identifying the need for randomised controlled trials to determine the optimal dose of ALA substitution to define the efficacy of dietary fat modification with ALA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26255030>Protective Effect of Unsaturated Fatty Acids on Palmitic -Induced Toxicity in Skeletal Muscle Cells is not Mediated by PPARδ Activation.</a></h2><p>Unsaturated free fatty acids (FFA) are able to prevent deleterious effects of saturated FFA in skeletal muscle cells although the mechanisms involved are still not completely understood. FFA act as endogenous ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), transcription factors regulating the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. The aim of this study was to determine whether activation of PPARδ, the most common PPAR subtype in skeletal muscle, plays a role in mediating the protective effect of unsaturated FFA on saturated FFA-induced damage in skeletal muscle cells and to examine an impact on mitochondrial respiration. Mouse C2C12 myotubes were treated for 24 h with different concentrations of saturated FFA (palmitic ), unsaturated FFA (oleic, linoleic and α-), and their combinations. PPARδ agonist GW501516 and antagonist GSK0660 were also used. Both mono- and polyunsaturated FFA, but not GW501516, prevented palmitic -induced cell death. Mono- and polyunsaturated FFA proved to be effective activators of PPARδ compared to saturated palmitic ; however, in combination with palmitic  their effect on PPARδ activation was blocked and stayed at the levels observed for palmitic  alone. Unsaturated FFA at moderate physiological concentrations as well as GW501516, but not palmitic , mildly uncoupled mitochondrial respiration. Our results indicate that although unsaturated FFA are effective activators of PPARδ, their protective effect on palmitic -induced toxicity is not mediated by PPARδ activation and subsequent induction of lipid regulatory genes in skeletal muscle cells. Other mechanisms, such as mitochondrial uncoupling, may underlie their effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30636521>Dietary Fats in Relation to Total and Cause-Specific Mortality in a Prospective Cohort of 521 120 Individuals With 16 Years of Follow-Up.</a></h2><p>Evidence linking saturated fat intake with cardiovascular health is controversial. The associations of unsaturated fats with total and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality remain inconsistent, and data about non-CVD mortality are limited.To assess dietary fat intake in relation to total and cause-specific mortality.We analyzed data of 521 120 participants aged 50 to 71 years from the National Institutes of Health-American Association of Retired Persons Diet and Health Study with 16 years of follow-up. Intakes of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans-fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were assessed via food frequency questionnaires. Hazard ratios and 95%CIs were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. Overall, 129 328 deaths were documented during 7.3 million person-years of follow-up. In the replacement of carbohydrates, multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios of total mortality comparing extreme quintiles were 1.29 (95% CI, 1.25-1.33) for SFAs, 1.03 (1.00-1.05) for trans-fatty acids, 0.98 (0.94-1.02) for MUFAs, 1.09 (1.06-1.13) for animal MUFAs, 0.94 (0.91-0.97) for plant MUFAs, 0.93 (0.91-0.95) for PUFAs, 0.92 (0.90-0.94) for marine omega-3 PUFAs, 1.06 (1.03-1.09) for α-, 0.88 (0.86-0.91) for linoleic , and 1.10 (1.08-1.13) for arachidonic . CVD mortality was inversely associated with marine omega-3 PUFA intake ( P trend <0.0001), whereas it was positively associated with SFA, trans-fatty , and arachidonic  intake. Isocalorically replacing 5% of the energy from SFAs with plant MUFAs was associated with 15%, 10%, 11%, and 30% lower total mortality, CVD, cancer, and respiratory disease mortality, respectively. Isocaloric replacement of SFA with linoleic  (2%) was associated with lower total (8%), CVD (6%), cancer (8%), respiratory disease (11%), and  (9%) mortality.Intakes of SFAs, trans-fatty acids, animal MUFAs, α-, and arachidonic  were associated with higher mortality. Dietary intake of marine omega-3 PUFAs and replacing SFAs with plant MUFAs or linoleic  were associated with lower total, CVD, and certain cause-specific mortality.URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

The relation between dietary and circulating FA in cardiometabolic patients is largely unknown. We examined whether dietary n-3 FA and LA were reflected in plasma lipid pools in post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients.Patients in Alpha Omega Cohort filled out a 203-item food-frequency questionnaire from which eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA),  (ALA), and LA intake were calculated. Circulating individual FA (% total FA) were assessed in cholesteryl esters (CE; n = 4066), phospholipids (PL; n = 838), and additionally in total plasma for DHA and LA (n = 739). Spearman correlation coefficients (r) were calculated for dietary vs. circulating FA. Circulating FA were also compared across dietary FA quintiles, overall and in subgroups by sex, obesity, , statin use, and high alcohol intake. Patients were on average 69 years old and 79% was male. Moderate correlations between dietary and circulating levels were observed for EPA (r∼0.4 in CE and PL) and DHA (r ∼0.5 in CE and PL, ∼0.4 in total plasma), but not for ALA (r ∼0.0). Weak correlations were observed for LA (r 0.1 to 0.2). Plasma LA was significantly lower in statin users and in patients with a high alcohol intake.In post-MI patients, dietary EPA and DHA were well reflected in circulating levels. This was not the case for LA, which may partly be influenced by alcohol use and statins.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

In the United States, most IVFEs are composed of 100% soybean oil; internationally multiple alternative IVFEs (using fish oil, olive oil, and long- and medium-chain triglycerides) are available or being developed. The hope is that these IVFEs will prevent, or decrease the risk of, some of the HPN-associated complications. The goal of this article is to review how IVFEs came into use, their composition and metabolism, options for IVFE delivery in HPN, benefits and risks of IVFE use, and strategies to minimize the risks associated with IVFE use in HPN patients.© 2016 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30309708>Association of erythrocyte n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids with incident type 2  in a Chinese population.</a></h2><p>The association between circulating n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) biomarkers and incident type 2  in Asian populations remains unclear. We aimed to examine the association of erythrocyte n-3 PUFA with incident type 2  in a Chinese population.A total of 2671 participants, aged 40-75 y, free of type 2  at baseline, were included in the present analysis. Incident type 2  cases (n = 213) were ascertained during median follow-up of 5.6 years. Baseline erythrocyte fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography. We used multivariable Cox regression models to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of type 2  across quartiles of erythrocyte n-3 PUFA.After adjustment for potential confounders, HRs (95% CIs) of type 2  were 0.68 (0.47, 1.00), 0.77 (0.52, 1.15), and 0.63 (0.41, 0.95) in quartiles 2-4 of docosapentaenoic  (C22:5n-3) (P-trend = 0.07), compared with quartile 1; and 1.08 (0.74, 1.60), 1.03 (0.70, 1.51), and 0.57 (0.38, 0.86) for eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5n-3) (P-trend = 0.007). No association was found for docosahexaenoic  (C22:6n-3) or  (C18:3n-3).Erythrocyte n-3 PUFA from marine sources (C22:5n-3 and C20:5n-3), as biomarkers of dietary marine n-3 PUFA, were inversely associated with incident type 2  in this Chinese population. Future prospective investigations in other Asian populations are necessary to confirm our findings.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Because of this, there is a high interest in healthy natural products that could prevent the appearance of such diseases. This paper aims to study the content of fatty acids (FAs) and phenolic compounds of brown alga Laminaria ochroleuca (L. ochroleuca) and to determine the nutritional quality of the lipids extracted using pressurized liquids extraction (PLE) technique. PLE was applied to the algae using four solvents of different polarity (hexane, ethyl acetate, ethanol and ethanol:water 1:1). Results showed that the higher yield (52%), is obtained with ethanol: water solvent, however, both ethyl acetate and ethanol enrich unsaturated fatty  (USFA) (palmitoleic, , linoleic, oleic, araquidonic and eicosapenataenoic) in the lipid fraction of L. ochroleuca, providing extracts up to 55% of their total fatty  content compared to other solvents. The nutritional quality of the lipids in all PLE extracts was assessed by considering the ω-6/ ω-3 fatty  ratio and two dietary indexes involved in the risks of coronary heart disease, atherogenic (AI) and thrombogenic (TI). The lower (best) index values are for ethanol extract, 4.4 (ω-6/ ω-3), 0.74 (AI) and 1.05 (TI), followed of ethyl acetate, 4.4 (ω-6/ ω-3), 0.87 (AI) and 1.24 (TI). Finally, the antioxidant capacity of PLE alga extracts in terms of total phenol content (TPC) was analyzed by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The ethanol: water extracts showed the highest TPC with a concentration up to 173.65 mg eq. gallic  / g PLE extract.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We quantitatively determined 11 FFAs, seven cytokine/adipokine, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and C-peptide levels from the fasting blood samples that were collected at 16 weeks of gestation. Multivariate analyses were performed along with separate analyses for each individual FFA.High HOMA-IR (p<0.001) and C-peptide (p<0.0001) levels were positively associated with a twofold to fourfold increased risk for developing gestational  (GDM). Negative relationships were found with specific FFAs (molecular percentage, palmitoleic, oleic, , myristic acids) and HOMA-IR and C-peptide levels (p<0.01 to p<0.0001). In contrast, palmitic, stearic, arachidonic, dihomo-γ- (DGLA) and docosahexaenoic acids were positively associated with HOMA-IR and C-peptide (p<0.01 to p<0.0001). The individual FFAs also predicted cytokine/adipokine levels. For example, women who had elevated DGLA (highest quartile) were twice as (adjusted OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.98) likely to have higher interleukin (IL)-8 (p<0.0001) levels. Conversely, women with high palmitoleic, oleic, and  levels had reduced odds (≥2-fold, p<0.01 to p<0.001) for having higher IL-8, IL-6 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels.Our results suggest that maternal individual FFAs uniquely affect insulin resistance and secretion. The effects are either direct or indirect via modulation of the inflammatory response. Modifying the composition of FFAs may help in reducing the risk of GDM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28651694>Maternal plasma phosphatidylcholine polyunsaturated fatty acids during pregnancy and offspring growth and adiposity.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are essential for offspring development, but it is less clear whether pregnancy PUFA status affects growth and adiposity.In 985 mother-offspring pairs from the ongoing Singaporean GUSTO cohort, we analyzed the associations between offspring growth and adiposity outcomes until age 5 years and five PUFAs of interest, measured in maternal plasma at 26-28 weeks' gestation: linoleic  (LA), arachidonic , α-, eicosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). We measured fetal growth by ultrasound (n=924), neonatal body composition (air displacement plethysmography (n=252 at birth, and n=317 at age 10 days), and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (n=317)), postnatal growth (n=979) and skinfold thicknesses (n=981). Results were presented as regression coefficients for a 5% increase in PUFA levels.LA levels were positively associated with birthweight (β (95% CI): 0.04 (0.01, 0.08) kg), body mass index (0.13 (0.02, 0.25) kg/m), head circumference (0.11 (0.03, 0.19) cm), and neonatal abdominal adipose tissue volume (4.6 (1.3, 7.8) mL for superficial subcutanous tissue, and 1.2 (0.1, 2.4) mL for internal tissue), but not with later outcomes. DHA levels, although not associated with birth outcomes, were related to higher postnatal length/height: 0.63 (0.09, 1.16) cm at 12 months and 1.29 (0.34, 2.24) cm at 5 years.LA was positively associated with neonatal body size, and DHA with child height. Maternal PUFA status during pregnancy may influence fetal and child growth and adiposity.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Visceral adiposity is part of the metabolic syndrome, together with insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension and inflammation. Alleviation of metabolic syndrome requires normalization of insulin release and responses. This review assesses our current knowledge of the mechanisms that allow n-3 PUFAs to improve insulin secretion and sensitivity. EPA has been more extensively studied than either ALA or DHA. The complex actions of EPA include increased G-protein-receptor-mediated release of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) from enteroendocrine L-cells in the intestine, up-regulation of the apelin pathway and down-regulation of other control pathways to promote insulin secretion by the pancreatic β-cells, together with suppression of inflammatory responses to adipokines, inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α actions and prevention of decreased insulin-like growth factor-1 secretion to improve peripheral insulin responses. The receptors involved and the mechanisms of action probably differ for ALA and DHA, with antiobesity effects predominating for ALA and anti-inflammatory effects for DHA. Modifying both GLP-1 release and the actions of adipokines by n-3 PUFAs could lead to additive improvements in both insulin secretion and sensitivity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This review covers total fats, individual fatty acids and foods that provide specific fats.Evidence for blood pressure lowering is stronger for supplements providing individual marine fatty acids than for fish intake since data on fish consumption are scarce. Such effects are more readily apparent in hypertensive than normal subjects. Biological mechanisms to support linkage between dietary fish oils and blood pressure are plausible. Information on other dietary fatty acids (saturates, linoleic , ) is mostly less robust and therefore inconclusive. However, findings with respect to consumption of dairy foods especially of the low-fat variety do suggest association with lower blood pressures. Apart from marine fatty acids which have mostly been significantly associated with clinically modest blood pressure-lowering, the effects of other dietary fatty acids are inconsistent or clinically minor. Consumption of dairy especially of yoghurt has been linked with lower blood pressure despite the relatively high saturated fat content but the mechanism is unclear.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26459126>[Effectiveness of phytotherapy in supportive treatment of type 2  III. Momordica (Momordica charantia)].</a></h2><p>Momordica charantia is a thermophilic voluble plant from the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa and the Caribbean. In central Europe, momordica requires greenhouse plantations. Mature fruits resemble a cucumber or a pumpkin and can be used as other similar vegetables. Crude fruits are very bitter and refreshing. For centuries the plant has been known in Chinese traditional medicine for its antidiabetic effects as well as for the treatment of cancer or infections caused by worms, viruses and malaria. Antidiabetic effects are attributed namely to cucurbitane type triterpenoids, charantin, p-insulin and 9cis-11trans-13trans-conjugated . These substances in momordica preparations show antidiabetic effectiveness in clinical studies by increasing insulin secretion and deceasing insulin resistance or glucose absorption from the gut. Beside this main effect the extract possesses certain neuroprotective and antioxidant effects (especially p9cis-11trans-13trans-conjugated ) and contributes to normalize blood lipid and adipokine levels which results in the normalization of metabolic syndrome. Antidiabetic effectiveness of momordica was compared to active treatment with several oral antidiabetic drugs and proved comparable effects. However, the number of studies is limited and their methodological approach variable. Therefore, the evidence is so far inconclusive.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30680455>Dietary intake of fish, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and risk of inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.</a></h2><p>Fish consumption and dietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated acids (PUFAs) may be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to conduct a systematic review and summarize published articles on the association between fish consumption and dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs with the risk of IBD.PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were used to conduct a comprehensive search and identify eligible literature published prior to January 2019. Fixed-effects model or random-effects models (DerSimonian-Laird method) were applied to pool the effect sizes. Cochrane Q test was used to trace the potential source of heterogeneity across studies.12 studies (5 prospective and 7 case-control) were included in the systematic review, which ten of them were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Studies were included a total sample size of 282610 participants which 2002 of them were cases of IBD [1061 Crohn's disease (CD) and 937 ulcerative colitis (UC)]. A negative association was found between fish consumption and the incidence of CD (pooled effect size: 0.54, 95%CI: 0.31-0.96, P = 0.03). There was no relationship between total dietary n-3 PUFAs intake and IBD (pooled effect size: 1.17, 95%CI: 0.80-1.72, P = 0.41).

Endotoxins are now well recognized as an important factor implicated in the onset and maintain of this inflammatory state during fat digestion in high-fat diet. As a preventive strategy, lipid formulation could be optimized to limit these phenomena, notably regarding fatty  profile and PL emulsifier content. Little is known about soybean polar lipid (SPL) consumption associated to oils rich in saturated FA vs. anti-inflammatory omega-3 FA such as α- on inflammation and metabolic endotoxemia. We then investigated in mice the effect of different synthetic diets enriched with two different oils, palm oil or flaxseed oil and containing or devoid of SPL on adipose tissue inflammation and endotoxin receptors. In both groups containing SPL, adipose tissue (WAT) increased compared with groups devoid of SPL and an induction of MCP-1 and LBP was observed in WAT. However, only the high-fat diet in which flaxseed oil was associated with SPL resulted in both higher WAT inflammation and higher circulating sCD14 in plasma. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that LPS transporters LBP and sCD14 and adipose tissue inflammation can be modulated by SPL in high fat diets differing in oil composition. Notably high-flaxseed oil diet exerts a beneficial metabolic impact, however blunted by PL addition. Our study suggests that nutritional strategies can be envisaged by optimizing dietary lipid sources in manufactured products, including fats/oils and polar lipid emulsifiers, in order to limit the inflammatory impact of palatable foods.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was done on 68 women diagnosed with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria aged 18-40 years old. Participants were randomly assigned into 2 groups to receive either 1 000 mg omega-3 fatty acids from flaxseed oil containing 400 mg α- plus 400 IU vitamin E supplements (n=34) or placebo (n=34) for 12 weeks. Hormonal parameters were quantified at the beginning of the study and after 12-week intervention. After 12 weeks of intervention, compared to the placebo, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E co-supplementation resulted in a significant decrease in insulin (-1.0±3.5 vs. +2.7±6.6 µIU/mL, P=0.004), homeostasis model of assessment-estimated insulin resistance (-0.2±0.8 vs. +0.6±1.5, P=0.005), homeostasis model of assessment-estimated B cell function (-4.3±14.3 vs. +10.5±24.5, P=0.004) and a significant increase in quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (+0.006±0.02 vs. -0.01±0.04, P=0.008).

Among them conjugated fatty acids are of great interest. Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA), which exert a multidirectional health-benefiting influence, and conjugated  acids (CLnA, super CLA) are examples of this group of fatty acids. CLnA are a group of positional and geometric isomers of octadecatrienoic  (C18:3), which possess double bonds at positions 9, 11, 13 or 8, 10, 12 of their chain. Some vegetable oils are rich sources of CLnA, e.g. bitter melon oil (from Momordica charantia seeds) and pomegranate oil (from Punica granatum seeds). The aim of this paper was to present information concerning natural sources and health-promoting activities of conjugated  acids. The presented data reveal that conjugated  acids may be very useful in prevention and treatment of many diseases, especially , arteriosclerosis , obesity and cancers (mammary, prostate and colon cancer). Among many potential mechanisms of their action, the fact that some CLnA are converted by oxidoreductases into CLA is very important. It seems to be very reasonable to conduct research concerning the possibility of CLnA use in prevention of many diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28931585>Fatty  Proportions in Plasma Cholesterol Esters and Phospholipids Are Positively Correlated in Various Swedish Populations.</a></h2><p> Fatty  (FA) proportions in cholesterol esters (CEs) and plasma phospholipids are widely used as dietary biomarkers. Information on how proportions in these fractions correlate could have implications for interpretation and use of FA biomarkers in observational and interventional studies. We investigated correlations between FA proportions in CEs and phospholipids in free-living individuals and assessed how diet-induced alterations of FA proportions correlate between fractions. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients () between FA proportions (percentage of total FAs) in circulating CEs and phospholipids were calculated separately in 8 individual study populations including Swedish females and males ( = 2052; age range: 11-84 y), and pooled by inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis. In addition, study populations were stratified by age, sex, body mass index (BMI; in kg/m), and  status, and strata-specific  were pooled by meta-analysis. In 2 randomized trials ( = 79) in which dietary saturated FAs were isocalorically replaced with unsaturated FAs, treatment-wise calculations of  were conducted between FA changes in CEs and phospholipids. Overall, FA proportions in CEs and phospholipids correlated well and especially strongly for polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs), with pooled  (95% CIs) ranging from 0.74 (0.72, 0.76) for α- to 0.92 (0.91, 0.93) for eicosapentaenoic . Weak correlations (pooled  < 0.4) were observed only for palmitic  and stearic , with pooled  (95% CIs): 0.29 (0.24, 0.33) and 0.30 (0.25, 0.34), respectively. Overall, correlations were not affected by age, sex, BMI, or  status. Strong correlations ( ≥ 0.6) between diet-induced FA changes in CEs and phospholipids were observed for most PUFAs. Proportions of most FAs in CEs and phospholipids ranked individuals similarly, suggesting that FA proportions in these fractions can be used interchangeably in populations of diverse age, sex, body composition, and  status. Caution is advised, however, when comparing results from studies assessing palmitic  or stearic  in different lipid fractions.© 2017 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25676565>Role of fish oil in human health and possible mechanism to reduce the inflammation.</a></h2><p>The roles of Omega-3 FAs are inflammation antagonists, while Omega-6 FAs are precursors for inflammation. The plant form of Omega-3 FAs is the short-chain α-, and the marine forms are the long-chain fatty acids: docosahexaenoic  and eicosapentaenoic . Omega-3 FAs have unlimited usages, and they are considered as omnipotent since they may benefit heart health, improve brain function, reduce cancer risks and improve people's moods. Omega-3 FAs also have several important biological effects on a range of cellular functions that may decrease the onset of heart diseases and reduce mortality among patients with coronary heart disease, possibly by stabilizing the heart's rhythm and by reducing blood clotting. Some review studies have described the beneficial roles of Omega-3 FAs in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancer, , and other conditions, including inflammation. Studies of the effect of Omega-3 FAs gathered from studies in diseased and healthy population. CVDs including atherosclerosis, coronary heart diseases, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome were the major fields of investigation. In studies of obesity, as the central obesity increased, the level of adipocyte synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were increased and the level of anti-inflammatory adiponectin was decreased indicating a state of inflammation. The level of C reactive protein (CRP) synthesized from hepatocyte is increased by the influence of IL-6. CRP can be considered as a marker of systemic inflammation associated with increased risks of CVDs. In molecular studies, Omega-3 FAs have direct effects on reducing the inflammatory state by reducing IL-6, TNF-α, CRP and many other factors.

TSL 95% ethanol extract exhibited the highest transactivity of PPARγ and contained the highest amounts of natural PPARγ ligands including palmitic , linoleic , and α- among different TSL ethanol extracts (0, 10, 50, 70, and 95%). The efficacy and the mechanism of TSL ethanol extract (95%) mediated anti-diabetic effects were examined by both in vivo and in vitro models in this study. An improved whole-body insulin sensitivity was observed in high-fat diet-fed (HFD) mice after 14 weeks of TSL treatment, as evidenced by a faster rate of plasma glucose clearing. The improved insulin sensitivity was through direct stimulation of PPARγ and adiponectin expression in adipose tissues of HFD mice. In addition to the PPARγ pathway, TSL stimulated glucose uptake via directly inducing AMPKα but not AS160 activation in C2C12 myotubes under palmitate-induced insulin resistance. TSL successfully induced sirtuin 1 and restored PGC1α, but failed to restore mitochondrial electron transport complexes I, III, IV and V in mRNA levels. Loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential coupled with AMPK activation suggests that TSL acts as a mitochondrial inhibitor to stimulate AMPK-mediated glucose uptake. This study demonstrated that TSL stimulated glucose uptake via AMPK activation in skeletal muscles and promoted PPARγ and normalized adiponectin expression in adipose tissues, thereby ameliorating insulin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887939>Fatty acids: a role for Africa?</a></h2><p>Health effects of fatty acids have been very controversial. Total mortality is inversely associated with the amount of total fat consumed. In contrast, trans fatty acids or SFA intake is positively related to mortality while the inverse is observed with consumption of MUFA or PUFA. Among PUFA, long-chain (LC) n-3 PUFA have many beneficial effects. Dietary intake of some types of fatty acids is specific to Africa. Energy from saturated fat does not exceed 14% and energy from n-6 PUFA does not exceed 8% of total energy intake. Dietary intake of LC n-3 PUFA is less than 100 mg/d whereas international recommendations promote 250-500 mg/d. Consumption of plant n-3 PUFA mainly α- (ALA) is highly variable depending on the country. Both fish and ALA availability are low in several African countries. The prevalence of  and cardiovascular events remain very low in Africa, partly explained by the fact that the whole dietary pattern is globally the best of all continents. One objective of 'fat for Africa' could be to increase, as much as possible, the dietary intake of LC n-3 PUFA by promoting sustainable aquaculture and to maintain as much as possible traditional dietary pattern by preventing a tendency to westernisation, provided that the amount of energy and protein is sufficient to fight against wasting and stunting where it still exists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27344992>A panel of free fatty  ratios to predict the development of metabolic abnormalities in healthy obese individuals.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidences support that metabolically healthy obese (MHO) is a transient state.

Results showed that higher baseline level of oleic /stearic  (OA/SA), and lower levels of stearic /palmitic  (SA/PA) and arachidonic /dihomo-γ- (AA/DGLA) ratios were associated with higher rate of MHO to MUO conversion in the longitudinal SHDS.

Genetic variants of fatty  desaturase (FADS) contribute to the variations of PUFA composition. Here we have explored whether similar correlations are also true among Chinese Han people.A case-control study was employed to examine this correlation in Han Chinese people. The study included 421 healthy adults and 331 T2DM patients.The ratio of arachidonic /linoleic  (AA/LA), which reflects Δ6 desaturase activity, was significantly increased in T2DM patients. Furthermore, the ratio of eicosapentaenoic /α- (EPA/ALA), which reflects Δ5 desaturase activity, was markedly decreased in T2DM patients. Importantly, among four single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs174545, rs2072114, rs174602 and rs174616) in the FADS1-FADS2 gene cluster, only minor allele (T) of rs174616 was associated with decreased risk of T2DM in both codominant and dominant models after adjustment for age, gender and BMI. Furthermore, the ratio of AA/LA in both controls and T2DM was reduced in T carriers while an increased proportion of LA was seen in T2DM patients compared with control patients.These data suggest that in northern Han Chinese people, the minor allele (T) of rs174616 in the FADS1-FADS2 gene cluster is associated with a decreased conversion rate of LA to AA, which may contribute to decreased reduced risk of developing T2DM.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The HFHC-SFA caused a significant increase in serum HDL cholesterol and phospholipids as well as elevated levels of oxidized HDL and oxidized LDL. Replacing SFA with PUFA significantly reduced the levels of these oxidized lipoproteins and enhanced the ability of HDL to protect LDL from oxidation. The SFA-mediated impairment of HDL antioxidant potential was not associated with the cholesterol content of the diet, obesity or insulin resistance. In contrast, the effect of the HFHC diets on fecal macrophage-derived cholesterol excretion was independent of the fatty  source.SFA intake impairs the antioxidant potential of HDL and increases serum levels of oxidized lipoprotein species whereas the antioxidant potential of HDL is enhanced after PUFA consumption.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Many aldehydes are volatile enough to be detected in headspace gases of blood or cultured cells and in exhaled breath, in particular propanal and hexanal which are derived from omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, respectively. Aldehydes are therefore potential non-invasive biomarkers of oxidative stress and of various diseases in which oxidative stress is thought to play a role including cancer, cardiovascular disease and . It is unclear, however, how changes in the abundance of the fatty  precursors, for example by altered dietary intake, affect aldehyde concentrations. We therefore fed male Wistar rats diets supplemented with either palm oil or a combination of palm oil plus an n-3 fatty  (, eicosapentaenoic, or docosahexaenoic acids) for 4 weeks. Fatty  analysis revealed large changes in the abundance of both n-3 and n-6 fatty acids in the liver with smaller changes observed in the brain. Despite the altered fatty  abundance, headspace concentrations of C1-C8 aldehydes, and tissue concentrations of thiobarbituric  reactive substances, did not differ between the 4 dietary groups. Our data suggest that tissue aldehyde concentrations are independent of fatty  abundance, and further support their use as volatile biomarkers of oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31434641>Omega-3, omega-6, and total dietary polyunsaturated fat for prevention and treatment of type 2 : systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.</a></h2><p>To assess effects of increasing omega-3, omega-6, and total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on  diagnosis and glucose metabolism.Systematic review and meta-analyses.Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Clinicaltrials.gov, and trials in relevant systematic reviews.Randomised controlled trials of at least 24 weeks' duration assessing effects of increasing α-, long chain omega-3, omega-6, or total PUFA, which collected data on  diagnoses, fasting glucose or insulin, glycated haemoglobin (HbA), and/or homoeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).Statistical analysis included random effects meta-analyses using relative risk and mean difference, and sensitivity analyses.

Rich in unsaturated fats, especially linoleic , soybean oil is assumed to be healthy, and yet it induces obesity, , insulin resistance, and fatty liver in mice. Here, we show that the genetically modified soybean oil Plenish, which came on the U.S. market in 2014 and is low in linoleic , induces less obesity than conventional soybean oil in C57BL/6 male mice. Proteomic analysis of the liver reveals global differences in hepatic proteins when comparing diets rich in the two soybean oils, coconut oil, and a low-fat diet. Metabolomic analysis of the liver and plasma shows a positive correlation between obesity and hepatic C18 oxylipin metabolites of omega-6 (ω6) and omega-3 (ω3) fatty acids (linoleic and α-, respectively) in the cytochrome P450/soluble epoxide hydrolase pathway. While Plenish induced less insulin resistance than conventional soybean oil, it resulted in hepatomegaly and liver dysfunction as did olive oil, which has a similar fatty  composition. These results implicate a new class of compounds in diet-induced obesity-C18 epoxide and diol oxylipins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27593084>Fatty -related modulations of membrane fluidity in cells: detection and implications.</a></h2><p>Metabolic homeostasis of fatty acids is complex and well-regulated in all organisms. The biosynthesis of saturated fatty acids (SFA) in mammals provides substrates for β-oxidation and ATP production. Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) are products of desaturases that introduce a methylene group in cis geometry in SFA. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 and n-3 PUFA) are products of elongation and desaturation of the essential linoleic  and α-, respectively. The liver processes dietary fatty acids and exports them in lipoproteins for distribution and storage in peripheral tissues. The three types of fatty acids are integrated in membrane phospholipids and determine their biophysical properties and functions. This study was aimed at investigating effects of fatty acids on membrane biophysical properties under varying nutritional and pathological conditions, by integrating lipidomic analysis of membrane phospholipids with functional two-photon microscopy (fTPM) of cellular membranes. This approach was applied to two case studies: first, pancreatic beta-cells, to investigate hormetic and detrimental effects of lipids.

Activation of GPR120 promotes the secretion of incretin GLP-1, which is known to have effects on anti-metabolic syndrome. As such, GPR120 is a potential target of pharmaceuticals for type II . In this study, we performed ligand-screening for GPR120 on glycero- and sphingo-type lipids and their derivatives using a Transforming Growth Factor α-shedding assay. We found that phytosphingosine (PHS) activates GPR120 in a manner comparable to the natural ligand α- (ALA) and superior to that of the synthetic ligand GW9508. The IC50 value of PHS was 33.4 μM, of ALA was 31.0 μM and of GW9508 was 41.7 μM. Additionally, PHS-induced activation of GPR120 was inhibited by the specific antagonist AH7614. Many of the natural or synthetic ligands found thus far are compounds with carboxyl groups. However, PHS does not possess a carboxyl group, suggesting that its manner of interaction with GPR120 may be significantly different from that of other ligands. Since PHS is rich in the plasma membrane of yeast, our results imply that PHS found in fermented food could have effects on anti- through activation of GPR120.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28918508>Metabolic engineering of Schizosaccharomyces pombe to produce punicic , a conjugated fatty  with nutraceutic properties.</a></h2><p>Punicic  (PuA) is a conjugated  (C18:3Δ) with a wide range of nutraceutic effects with the potential to reduce the incidence of a number of health disorders including , obesity, and cancer. It is the main component of seed oil from Punica granatum and Trichosanthes kirilowii. Previously, production of relatively high levels of this unusual fatty  in the seed oil of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plant was accomplished by the use of A. thaliana fad3/fae1 mutant high in linoleic  (18:2∆) and by co-expression of P. granatum FATTY  CONJUGASE (PgFADX) with Δ12-DESATURASE (FAD2). In the current study, P. granatum cDNAs governing PuA production were introduced into the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Expression of PgFADX alone resulted in production of PuA at the level of 19.6% of total fatty acids. Co-expression PgFADX with PgFAD2, however, further enhanced PuA content to 25.1% of total fatty acids, the highest level reported to date for heterologous expression.

Findings were centrally pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was examined by age, sex, race, , statins, aspirin, ω-6 levels, and FADS desaturase genes.Incident total CHD, fatal CHD, and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI).The 19 studies comprised 16 countries, 45 637 unique individuals, and 7973 total CHD, 2781 fatal CHD, and 7157 nonfatal MI events, with ω-3 measures in total plasma, phospholipids, cholesterol esters, and adipose tissue. Median age at baseline was 59 years (range, 18-97 years), and 28 660 (62.8%) were male.

Although DPA was associated with a lower risk of total CHD (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90-0.99), ALA (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.95-1.05), EPA (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.87-1.02), and DHA (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-1.00) were not. Significant associations with nonfatal MI were not evident. Associations appeared generally stronger in phospholipids and total plasma. Restricted cubic splines did not identify evidence of nonlinearity in dose responses.On the basis of available studies of free-living populations globally, biomarker concentrations of seafood and plant-derived ω-3 fatty acids are associated with a modestly lower incidence of fatal CHD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26116231>Insulin resistance by TNF-α is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and is ameliorated by punicic , a PPARγ agonist.</a></h2><p>Punicic  (PA), a poly unsaturated fatty  found abundantly in pomegranate seed oil is reported to have PPARγ agonist property.

An accurate prediction of future type 2  risk in the early postpartum period after GDM would allow for timely interventions to prevent or delay type 2 . In addition, new targets for interventions may be revealed by understanding the underlying pathophysiology of the transition from GDM to type 2 . The aim of this study is to identify both a predictive signature and early-stage pathophysiology of the transition from GDM to type 2 .We used a well-characterised prospective cohort of women with a history of GDM pregnancy, all of whom were enrolled at 6-9 weeks postpartum (baseline), were confirmed not to have  via 2 h 75 g OGTT and tested anually for type 2  on an ongoing basis (2 years of follow-up). A large-scale targeted lipidomic study was implemented to analyse ~1100 lipid metabolites in baseline plasma samples using a nested pair-matched case-control design, with 55 incident cases matched to 85 non-case control participants. The relationships between the concentrations of baseline plasma lipids and respective follow-up status (either type 2  or no type 2 ) were employed to discover both a predictive signature and the underlying pathophysiology of the transition from GDM to type 2 . In addition, the underlying pathophysiology was examined in vivo and in vitro.Machine learning optimisation in a decision tree format revealed a seven-lipid metabolite type 2  predictive signature with a discriminating power (AUC) of 0.92 (87% sensitivity, 93% specificity and 91% accuracy). The signature was highly robust as it includes 45-fold cross-validation under a high confidence threshold (1.0) and binary output, which together minimise the chance of data overfitting and bias selection. Concurrent analysis of differentially expressed lipid metabolite pathways uncovered the upregulation of α-/linoleic  metabolism (false discovery rate [FDR] 0.002) and fatty  biosynthesis (FDR 0.005) and the downregulation of sphingolipid metabolism (FDR 0.009) as being strongly associated with the risk of developing future type 2 . Focusing specifically on sphingolipids, the downregulation of sphingolipid metabolism using the pharmacological inhibitors fumonisin B1 (FB1) and myriocin in mouse islets and Min6 K8 cells (a pancreatic beta-cell like cell line) significantly impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion but had no significant impact on whole-body glucose homeostasis or insulin sensitivity.We reveal a novel predictive signature and associate reduced sphingolipids with the pathophysiology of transition from GDM to type 2 .

After adjustment for other confounders, the ratio of EPA/AA (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.12-0.70, p = 0.0055) and the ratio of n-3/n-6 PUFAs (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25-0.80, p = 0.0066) showed an independent reverse association with carotid atherosclerosis. In addition, the area under receiver-operating characteristic curves for carotid atherosclerosis was significantly greater in an established risk model with EPA/AA and n-3/n-6 ratios than in the established risk model alone.These data suggest that low ratios of both EPA/AA ratio and n-3/n-6 PUFAs were closely associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients on HD.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We studied the long-term diabetic risk in GDM offspring and evaluated the effect of n-3 PUFA intervention. Healthy offspring rats were fed standard diet (soybean oil) after weaning. GDM offspring were divided into three groups: GDM offspring (soybean oil), n-3 PUFA adequate offspring (fish oil), and n-3 PUFA deficient offspring (safflower oil), fed up to 11 months old. The diabetic risk of GDM offspring gradually increased from no change at weaning to obvious impaired glucose and insulin tolerance at 11 months old. N-3 PUFA decreased oxidative stress and inflammation in the liver of older GDM offspring. There was a differential effect of n-3 PUFA and n-6 PUFA on hepatic telomere length in GDM offspring. Non-targeted metabolomics showed that n-3 PUFA played a modulating role in the liver, in which numerous metabolites and metabolic pathways were altered when GDM offspring grew to old age. Many metabolites were related to  risk, such as α-, palmitic , ceramide, oxaloacetic , tocotrienol, tetrahydro-11-deoxycortisol, andniacinamide.

Thus, our objective was to evaluate the effect of long-term consumption of weakly oxidised PUFA from flaxseed oil on oxidative stress biomarkers of LDL-receptor(-/-) mice. To test our hypothesis, mice were separated into three groups. The first group received a high-fat diet containing fresh flaxseed oil (CONT-), the second was fed the same diet prepared using heated flaxseed oil (OXID), and the third group received the same diet containing fresh flaxseed oil and had  induced by streptozotocin (CONT+). Oxidative stress, aortic parameters and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease were assessed. After 3 months, plasma lipid profile, glucose levels, body weight, energy intake and dietary intake did not differ among groups. Likewise, oxidative stress, plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), hepatic MDA expressed as nmol/mg portion (ptn) and antioxidant enzymes did not differ among the groups. Hepatic linoleic , α-, arachidonic  and EPA  declined in the OXID and CONT+ groups. Aortic wall thickness, lumen and diameter increased only in the OXID group. OXID and CONT+ groups exhibited higher concentrations of MDA, expressed as μmol/mg ptn per %PUFA, when compared with the CONT- group. Our results suggest that ingestion of oxidised flaxseed oil increases hepatic MDA concentration and is potentially pro-atherogenic. In addition, the mean MDA value observed in all groups was similar to those reported in other studies that used xenobiotics as oxidative stress inducers.

It has been shown to exhibit a myriad of beneficial bioactivities including anti-cancer, anti-, anti-obesity, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. Pomegranate (Punica granatum) seed oil contains approximately 80% PuA and is currently the major natural source of this remarkable fatty . While both PuA and pomegranate seed oil have been used as functional ingredients in foods and cosmetics for some time, their value in pharmaceutical/medical and industrial applications are presently under further exploration. Unfortunately, the availability of PuA is severely limited by the low yield and unstable supply of pomegranate seeds.

We sought to investigate serum fatty  composition in CD, and associations of fatty acids with disease activity, cytokines, and adipokines. Serum was prospectively collected from 116 CD subjects and 27 non-IBD controls. Clinical disease activity was assessed by the Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI). Serum fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography. Serum cytokines and adipokines were measured by Luminex assay. Dietary histories were obtained from a subset of patients.

BA dysregulation plays an important role in the development of metabolic disease. However, BAs in relation to fatty acids have not been fully investigated in obesity-related metabolic disorders. A targeted metabolomic measurement of serum BA and free fatty  profiles was applied to sera of 381 individuals in 2 independent studies. The results showed that the ratio of dihomo-γ- (DGLA) to deoxycholic  (DCA) species (DCAS) was significantly increased in obese individuals with type 2  (T2DM) from a case-control study and decreased in the remission group of obese subjects with T2DM after metabolic surgery. The changes were closely associated with their metabolic status. These results were consistently confirmed in both serum and liver of mice with diet-induced obesity, implying that such a metabolic alteration in circulation reflects changes occurring in the liver.  studies of human liver L-02 cell lines under BA treatment revealed that DCA and its conjugated form, TDCA, significantly inhibited mRNA expression of fatty  transport protein 5 in the presence of DGLA, which was involved in hepatocyte DGLA uptake. Thus, the DGLA:DCAS ratio may be a promising biomarker for metabolic abnormalities in obesity.-Lei, S., Huang, F., Zhao, A., Chen, T., Chen, W., Xie, G., Zheng, X., Zhang, Y., Yu, H., Zhang, P., Rajani, C., Bao, Y., Jia, W., Jia, W.

PPARγ receptor is found to play a crucial role in the modulation of lipid and glucose homeostasis. Its commotion has been reported to play a significant role in a broad spectrum of diseases such as type 2 , inflammatory diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and in some cancers. Hence, PPARγ is an important therapeutic target. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and their metabolites (henceforth referred to as bioactive lipids) are known to function as agonists of PPARγ. However, agonistic binding modes and affinity of these ligands to PPARγ are yet to be deciphered.In this study, we performed a comparative molecular docking, binding free energy calculation and molecular dynamics simulation to infer and rank bioactive lipids based on the binding affinities with the ligand binding domain (LBD) of PPARγ.The results inferred affinity in the order of resolvin E1 > neuroprotectin D1 > hydroxy-linoleic  > docosahexaenoic  > lipoxin A4 > gamma-, arachidonic  >  > eicosapentaenoic  > linoleic . Of all the bioactive lipids studied, resolvin E1, neuroprotectin D1 and hydroxy-linoleic  showed significant affinity comparable to proven PPARγ agonist namely, rosiglitazone, in terms of Glide XP docking score, H-bond formation with the key residues, binding free energy and stable complex formation with LBD favouring co-activator binding, as inferred through Molecular Dynamics trajectory analysis.Hence, these three bioactive lipids (resolvin E1, neuroprotectin D1 and hydroxy-linoleic ) may be favourably considered as ideal drug candidates in therapeutic modulation of clinical conditions such as type 2 DM, Alzheimer's disease and other instances where PPARγ is a key player.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26671157>Correlation between the serum eicosapentanoic -to-arachidonic  ratio and the severity of cerebral white matter hyperintensities in older adults with memory disorder.</a></h2><p>The relationships of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic  and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), to stroke and cardiovascular events have been studied extensively. The present study was undertaken to analyze the relationships of the severity of cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH) to the blood polyunsaturated fatty acids level and the ratio of serum EPA level to the serum arachidonic  (AA) level (EPA/AA ratio) among older adults.A total of 150 patients underwent diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging and blood sampling under the fasting state. In regard to WMH, the periventricular hyperintensities and deep white matter hyperintensities were rated according to the Fazekas classification. The serum docosahexaenoic , EPA, AA, dihomo-γ- and EPA/AA ratio were compared in relation to the grade of severity of WMH. Furthermore, multiple regression analysis was carried out with age, sex and atherosclerosis risk factors (hypertension, , hyperlipidemia, smoking status) as the covariables, serum polyunsaturated fatty acids level as an independent variable and Fazekas grade as the dependent variable.A rise of the periventricular hyperintensities grade was associated with a significant reduction of the mean EPA level (P < 0.05) and EPA/AA ratio (P < 0.05). The multiple regression analysis identified a significant negative correlation between the periventricular hyperintensities grade and the serum EPA/AA ratio (β = -0.215, P < 0.05).These results suggest that the serum EPA/AA ratio have an important role in the formation and progression of WMH.© 2015 Japan Geriatrics Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311728>Effect of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy on Fatty  Composition and Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 1 in Adult Insulin-Dependent  Patients: A Pilot Study.</a></h2><p>Metabolic changes in insulin-dependent  (IDDM) impair vasodilation, and this leads to tissue hypoxia and microvascular pathology. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can significantly improve the outcome of ischemic conditions in IDDM patients and reduce vascular complications. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of HBOT on plasma fatty  (FA) composition, and expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) in IDDM patients.Our study included 24 adult IDDM patients diagnosed with peripheral vascular complications. The patients were exposed to 10 sessions of 100% oxygen inhalation at 2.4 atmosphere absolute for 1 hour. Blood samples were collected at admission and after HBOT for measurement of metabolic parameters, FA composition and IGFBP-1. Measurement of plasma FA composition was determined by gas chromatography. Expression of IGFBP-1 in the serum was estimated by Western blot analysis.HBOT decreased blood levels of total cholesterol (p<0.05), triglycerides (p<0.05) and low-density lipoprotein (p<0.05). HBOT increased plasma levels of individual FAs: palmitic  (p<0.05), palmitoleic  (p<0.05), docosapentaenoic  (p<0.05) and docosahexaenoic  (p<0.01), and decreased levels of stearic  (p<0.05),  (p<0.05) and linoleic  (p<0.01). Expression of IGFBP-1 (p<0.01) was increased, whereas the level of insulin (p<0.001) was decreased in the serum after HBOT.Our results indicate that HBOT exerts beneficial effects in IDDM patients by improving the lipid profile and altering FA composition.Copyright © 2019 Canadian  Association.

The objective of the present study was to prospectively examine the association between circulating concentrations of individual FAs and T2D incidence among Japanese adults. We conducted a nested case-control study in a cohort of 4754 employees, aged 34-69 y, who attended a comprehensive health checkup in 2008-2009 and donated blood samples for the Hitachi Health Study. During 5 y of follow-up,  was identified on the basis of plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and self-report. Two controls matched to each case by sex, age, and date of checkup were randomly chosen by using density sampling, resulting in 336 cases and 678 controls with FA measurements. GC was used to measure the FA composition in serum phospholipids. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the HRs and 95% CIs after adjusting for potential confounders. We examined the association of T2D risk with 25 different individual and combinations of FAs. T2D risk was positively associated with serum dihomo-γ-linoleic  concentration (highest compared with the lowest quartile-HR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.04, 2.11; trend = 0.02) and inversely associated with Δ5-desaturase activity (highest compared with the lowest quartile-HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.99; trend = 0.02), independent of body mass index (BMI). There were also inverse associations between T2D risk with serum total n-6 (ω-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), linoleic , and -vaccenic , but these were attenuated and became nonsignificant after adjustment for BMI. Serum n-3 (ω-3) PUFAs and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) were not associated with T2D risk. T2D risk was associated with circulating concentrations of the n-6 PUFA dihomo-γ-linoleic  and Δ5-desaturase activity but not with n-3 PUFA or SFA concentrations in Japanese adults.© 2017 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31266749>Dietary fats and mortality among patients with type 2 : analysis in two population based cohort studies.</a></h2><p>To assess the association of dietary fatty acids with cardiovascular disease mortality and total mortality among patients with type 2 .Prospective, longitudinal cohort study.Health professionals in the United States.11 264 participants with type 2  in the Nurses' Health Study (1980-2014) and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986-2014).Dietary fat intake assessed using validated food frequency questionnaires and updated every two to four years.Total and cardiovascular disease mortality during follow-up.During follow-up, 2502 deaths including 646 deaths due to cardiovascular disease were documented. After multivariate adjustment, intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) was associated with a lower cardiovascular disease mortality, compared with total carbohydrates: hazard ratios comparing the highest with the lowest quarter were 0.76 (95% confidence interval 0.58 to 0.99; P for trend=0.03) for total PUFAs, 0.69 (0.52 to 0.90; P=0.007) for marine n-3 PUFAs, 1.13 (0.85 to 1.51) for α-, and 0.75 (0.56 to 1.01) for linoleic . Inverse associations with total mortality were also observed for intakes of total PUFAs, n-3 PUFAs, and linoleic , whereas monounsaturated fatty acids of animal, but not plant, origin were associated with a higher total mortality. In models that examined the theoretical effects of substituting PUFAs for other fats, isocalorically replacing 2% of energy from saturated fatty acids with total PUFAs or linoleic  was associated with 13% (hazard ratio 0.87, 0.77 to 0.99) or 15% (0.85, 0.73 to 0.99) lower cardiovascular disease mortality, respectively. A 2% replacement of energy from saturated fatty acids with total PUFAs was associated with 12% (hazard ratio 0.88, 0.83 to 0.94) lower total mortality.In patients with type 2 , higher intake of PUFAs, in comparison with carbohydrates or saturated fatty acids, is associated with lower total mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality.

However, the clinical relevance of omega-3PUFAs in human retinal pathologies remains unclear. The ARED 2 study found no effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on progression of age related macular degeneration (AMD). The aim of this study was to compare serum levels of omega-3- and omega-6 PUFAs between patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR), AMD and retinal vein occlusion (RVO), and to identify potential confounders of serum level measurements.Venous blood samples were collected from 44 patients with DR, 25 with AMD, 12 with RVO and 27 controls. The lipid phase was extracted and analyzed using mass spectrometry. Retinal disease staging was done by indirect funduscopy and FAG where appropriate. Patient demographics and medical history including current medication and fasting state were acquired. Tukey contrasts for multiple comparisons of the mean and linear regression analysis were used for statistical analysis.Our data revealed no significant differences in omega-6 PUFA serum levels between patients with AMD, DR, RVO and controls (p > 0.858). Uncorrected omega-3 PUFA levels were significantly higher in patients with AMD compared to DR but not compared to controls (p = 0.004). However, after correcting for possible confounders such as body mass index (BMI), age, sex, fasting and use of statins, no statistically significant difference remained for serum omega-3 PUFA levels. Fasting was identified as an independent confounder of total omega-6 PUFAs, three individual omega-6 PUFAs and one omega-3 PUFA(p < 0.0427). Statin use was identified as an independent confounder of α- (an omega-3PUFA; p = 0.0210).In this pilot study with relatively low patient numbers, we report significant differences in serum levels of omega-3PUFAs among patients with different types of retinal diseases. However, these differences were not robust for disease specificity after correction for possible confounders in our cohort. Our results demonstrate that serum lipid profiles need to be interpreted with caution since they are significantly altered by variables like fasting and medication use independent from the underlying disease. Correcting for respective confounders is thus necessary to compare serum lipid profiles in clinical studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31521398>Mediterranean diet: The role of long-chain ω-3 fatty acids in fish; polyphenols in fruits, vegetables, cereals, coffee, tea, cacao and wine; probiotics and vitamins in prevention of stroke, age-related cognitive decline, and Alzheimer disease.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms of action of the dietary components of the Mediterranean diet are reviewed in prevention of cardiovascular disease, stroke, age-associated cognitive decline and Alzheimer disease. A companion article provides a comprehensive review of extra-virgin olive oil. The benefits of consumption of long-chain ω-3 fatty acids are described. Fresh fish provides eicosapentaenoic  while α- is found in canola and soybean oils, purslane and nuts. These ω-3 fatty acids interact metabolically with ω-6 fatty acids mainly linoleic  from corn oil, sunflower oil and peanut oil. Diets rich in ω-6 fatty acids inhibit the formation of healthier ω-3 fatty acids. The deleterious effects on lipid metabolism of excessive intake of carbohydrates, in particular high-fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners, are explained. The critical role of the ω-3 fatty  docosahexaenoic  in the developing and aging brain and in Alzheimer disease is addressed. Nutritional epidemiology studies, prospective population-based surveys, and clinical trials confirm the salutary effects of fish consumption on prevention of coronary artery disease, stroke and dementia. Recent recommendations on fish consumption by pregnant women and potential mercury toxicity are reviewed. The polyphenols and flavonoids of plant origin play a critical role in the Mediterranean diet, because of their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of benefit in type-2 , cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancer prevention. Polyphenols from fruits and vegetables modulate tau hyperphosphorylation and beta amyloid aggregation in animal models of Alzheimer disease. From the public health viewpoint worldwide the daily consumption of fruits and vegetables has become the main tool for prevention of cardiovascular disease and stroke.

Recent studies have demonstrated an inverse association between nut consumption and incidence of colon cancer; however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. An emerging concept suggests that microribonucleic acids (miRNAs) may help explain the relationship between walnut consumption and decreased colorectal neoplasia risk. Seven days after HT-29 colon cancer cell injection, mice were randomized to either control or walnut diets for 25 days of diet treatment. Thirty samples of tumor and of omental adipose were analyzed to determine changes in lipid composition in each dietary group. In the tumors of the walnut-containing diet, we found significant increases in α-, eicosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic and total omega-3 acids, and a decrease in arachidonic , as compared to the control diet. Final tumor size measured at sacrifice was negatively associated with percentage of total omega-3 fatty  composition (r=-0.641, P=.001). MicroRNA expression analysis of colorectal tumor tissue revealed decreased expression of miRNAs 1903, 467c and 3068 (P<.05) and increased expression of miRNA 297a* (P=.0059) in the walnut-treated group as compared to control diet. Our results indicate that changes in the miRNA expression profiles likely affect target gene transcripts involved in pathways of anti-inflammation, antivascularization, antiproliferation and apoptosis. We also demonstrate the incorporation of protective fatty acids into colonic epithelium of walnut-fed mice, which may independently alter miRNA expression profiles itself. Future studies of the mechanism of widespread miRNA regulation by walnut consumption are needed to offer potential prognostic and therapeutic targets.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Amounts of LC-PUFA depend on the exogenous intake of their precursors [linoleic (LA) and α- (ALA)] and by rate of their metabolism, which is influenced by activities of enzymes, such as Δ6-desaturase (D6D, FADS2), D5D, FADS1, elongases (Elovl2, -5, 6).Altered activities of D5D/D6D were described in plenty of diseases, e.g. neuropsychiatric (depressive disorders, bipolar disorder, dementia), metabolic (obesity, metabolic syndrome, DM2) and cardiovascular diseases (arterial hypertension, coronary heart disease), inflammatory states and allergy (Crohns disease, atopic eczema) or some malignancies. Similar results were obtained in studies dealing with the associations between genotypes/haplotypes of FADS1/FADS2 and above mentioned diseases, or interactions of dietary intake of LA and ALA on one hand and of the polymorphisms of minor allels of FADS1/FADS2, usually characterized by lower activities, on the other hand.The decrease of the desaturases activities leads to decreased concentrations of products with concomitant increased concentrations of substrates. Associations of some SNP FADS with coronary heart disease, concentrations of plasma lipids, oxidative stress, glucose homeostasis, and inflammatory reaction, were described.

The present study was conducted to elucidate the effects of the fixed oil extracted from OS leaves on the blood glucose levels and serum lipid profile of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. In addition, the anti-oxidative activity of OS leaves to protect various organs including the liver, kidney and heart was investigated. The fixed oil of the OS leaves was extracted using hexane, and the various fatty  contents of the oil were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Male Wistar rats were allocated into three groups (n=7 per group): Normal control rats, diabetic rats and diabetic rats fed daily with the fixed oil for three weeks. The results showed that α- was the primary fatty  contained in the fixed oil of OS. After 3 weeks of diabetic induction, the rats exhibited increased blood glucose levels and serum lipid profile, in addition to elevated serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase MB subunit (CK-MB), creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). The fixed oil significantly decreased the elevated levels of blood glucose, the serum lipid profile and the levels of serum creatinine and BUN (P<0.001), without exerting significant effects on the elevated serum levels of AST, ALT, LDH and CK-MB. Furthermore, the fixed oil increased the diabetically-reduced levels of serum insulin and decreased the rat kidney weight. Fixed oil suppressed the elevated thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) level and increased the activity of various antioxidative enzymes in the rat renal tissue.

D6D is a rate-limiting enzyme for maintaining many aspects of lipid homeostasis and normal health. D6D is important to recognize the mechanisms that regulate the expression of this enzyme in humans. A lower level of D6D was seen in breast tumors compared to normal tissues. Interestingly, the elevated serum level of D6D was seen in MS and DM, which explains the critical role of D6D in inflammatory diseases.We searched databases of PubMed, Web of Science (WOS), Google Scholar, Scopus and related studies by predefined eligibility criteria. We assessed their quality and extracted data.Regarding the mTOR signaling pathway, there is remarkable contributions of many inflammatory diseases to attention to common metabolic pathways are depicted. Of course, we need to have the insights into each disorder and their pathological process. The first step in balancing the intake of EFAs is to prevent the disruption of metabolism and expression of the D6D enzyme.The ω6 and ω3 pathways are two major pathways in the biosynthesis of PUFAs. In both of these, D6D is a vital bifunctional enzyme desaturating linoleic  or . Therefore, if ω6 and ω3 EFAs are given together in a ratio of 2: 1, the D6D expression will be down-regulated and normalized.Creative Commons Attribution License</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29359025>Cardiac autonomic neuropathy: Risk factors, diagnosis and treatment.</a></h2><p>Cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is a serious complication of  (DM) that is strongly associated with approximately five-fold increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. CAN manifests in a spectrum of things, ranging from resting tachycardia and fixed heart rate (HR) to development of "silent" myocardial infarction. Clinical correlates or risk markers for CAN are age, DM duration, glycemic control, hypertension, and dyslipidemia (DLP), development of other microvascular complications. Established risk factors for CAN are poor glycemic control in type 1 DM and a combination of hypertension, DLP, obesity, and unsatisfactory glycemic control in type 2 DM. Symptomatic manifestations of CAN include sinus tachycardia, exercise intolerance, orthostatic hypotension (OH), abnormal blood pressure (BP) regulation, dizziness, presyncope and syncope, intraoperative cardiovascular instability, asymptomatic myocardial ischemia and infarction. Methods of CAN assessment in clinical practice include assessment of symptoms and signs,  based on HR and BP, short-term electrocardiography (ECG), QT interval prolongation, HR variability (24 h, classic 24 h Holter ECG), ambulatory BP monitoring, HR turbulence, baroreflex sensitivity, muscle sympathetic nerve activity, catecholamine assessment and cardiovascular sympathetic tests, heart sympathetic imaging. Although it is common complication, the significance of CAN has not been fully appreciated and there are no unified treatment algorithms for today. Treatment is based on early diagnosis, life style changes, optimization of glycemic control and management of cardiovascular risk factors. Pathogenetic treatment of CAN includes: Balanced diet and physical activity; optimization of glycemic control; treatment of DLP; antioxidants, first of all α-lipoic  (ALA), aldose reductase inhibitors, acetyl-L-carnitine; vitamins, first of all fat-soluble vitamin B1; correction of vascular endothelial dysfunction; prevention and treatment of thrombosis; in severe cases-treatment of OH. The promising methods include prescription of prostacyclin analogues, thromboxane A2 blockers and drugs that contribute into strengthening and/or normalization of Na, K-ATPase (phosphodiesterase inhibitor), ALA, dihomo-γ- (DGLA), ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs), and the simultaneous prescription of ALA, ω-3 PUFAs and DGLA, but the future investigations are needed. Development of OH is associated with severe or advanced CAN and prescription of nonpharmacological and pharmacological, in the foreground midodrine and fludrocortisone acetate, treatment methods are necessary.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28916975>Flaxseed Oil Supplementation Improve Gene Expression Levels of PPAR-γ, LP(a), IL-1 and TNF-α in Type 2 Diabetic Patients with Coronary Heart Disease.</a></h2><p>This study was carried out to determine the effects of flaxseed oil administration on gene expression levels related to insulin, lipid and inflammation in overweight diabetic patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). This randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted among 60 diabetic patients with CHD. Subjects were randomly allocated into two groups to intake either 1000 mg n-3 fatty  from flaxseed oil containing 400 mg α- [ALA (18:3n-3)] (n = 30) or placebo (n = 30) twice a day for 12 weeks. Gene expression related to insulin, lipid and inflammation were quantified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of diabetic patients with CHD with RT-PCR method. Results of RT-PCR demonstrated that after the 12-week intervention, compared with the placebo, flaxseed oil supplementation could up-regulate gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) (P = 0.02) in PBMC of diabetic patients with CHD. In addition, compared with the placebo, taking flaxseed oil supplements down-regulated gene expression levels of lipoprotein(a) [LP(a)] (P = 0.001), interleukin-1 (IL-1) (P = 0.001) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) (P = 0.02) in PBMC of diabetic patients with CHD. We did not observe any significant effect of flaxseed oil supplementation on gene expression levels of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), IL-8 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) in PBMC of diabetic patients with CHD.

To test the hypothesis that the fatty  (FA) compositions differ between Sri Lankan and Japanese populations and that high concentrations of n-3 polyunsaturated FAs and linoleic  are associated with a low level of arteriosclerosis, the authors compared the circulating FA compositions between Sri Lankan and Japanese populations and examined the association of the circulating FA composition with arterial stiffness in each population. The study participants were patients with , dyslipidemia, or hypertension in Sri Lanka (n = 100) or Japan (n = 236). Serum FA compositions were measured by gas chromatography. Arterial stiffness was measured using the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI). Analysis of covariance was used to compare the FA compositions between the populations. Multiple regression was used to assess the association between each FA and CAVI levels. The concentrations of myristic, γ-, dihomo-γ-, and arachidonic acids were higher in the Sri Lankan patients than in the Japanese patients. In contrast, the concentrations of linoleic, α-, and eicosapentaenoic acids were higher in the Japanese patients than in the Sri Lankan patients. Although no associations of n-3 polyunsaturated FAs and linoleic  with CAVI were observed in both patient populations, odd-chain saturated FAs (pentadecanoic and heptadecanoic acids) were significantly inversely associated with CAVI levels in the Sri Lankan (P for trend = .03) but not the Japanese patients. The odd-chain saturated FAs might be inversely associated with atherosclerosis in this Sri Lankan population.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The inclusion criterion was the diagnosis of type 2 . The exclusion criteria were as follows: body mass index >40 kg/m2, heart failure, gastroparesis, diabetic diarrhea, dietary counseling by a registered dietitian during the previous 12 months, and inability to perform the weighed diet records (WDR). The dietary fatty acids (saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated) consumption was estimated by 3-day WDR. Compliance with the WDR technique was assessed by comparison of protein intake estimated from the 3-day WDR and from the 24-h urinary nitrogen output performed on the third day of the WDR period. The presence of DKD was defined as urinary albumin excretion (UAE) ≥ 30 mg / 24 h or/and glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m2.

Since then, new findings have been published regarding the relationship between omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, including supplementation, and cardiovascular health.A literature search was undertaken in PubMed and Medline, for literature published between January 1, 2007 and August 31, 2013.A total of eight research questions were developed and, using the National Health and Medical Research Council's evidence assessment framework, conclusions were made in relation to dietary intake of fish and omega-3 LCPUFA for cardiovascular health. In the evidence published since 2007, this summary of evidence concludes that dietary intake of fish was found to be mostly consistent with respect to protection from heart disease and stroke. Higher fish intake was associated with lower incident rates of heart failure in addition to lower sudden cardiac death, stroke and myocardial infarction. In relation to omega-3 LCPUFA supplementation, neither a beneficial nor adverse effect was demonstrated in primary or secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). Although the evidence continues to be positive for the role of omega-3 LCPUFA in the treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia and a modest positive benefit in heart failure.

Lipotoxicity to the pancreatic beta cells is considered to be a major underlying cause for this phenomenon. The aim of this study was to analyse the toxicity profile of FFAs in the human EndoC-βH1 beta-cell line and to compare the results with isolated rat and human islets with special reference to the physiologically most prevalent FFAs palmitic  (PA) and oleic  (OA). Toxicity after a 2-day incubation with the different FFAs was analysed by the caspase-3 assay and confirmed by the propidium iodide and annexin V staining tests. The long-chain saturated PA (C16:0) and the monounsaturated OA (C18:1) were both toxic to human EndoC-βH1 beta cells and pseudoislets, as well as to rat islets, and, as confirmed in a pilot experiment, also to human islets. Furthermore, OA provided no protection against the toxicity of PA. Likewise, elaidic  (EA, the trans isomer of OA; trans-OA) was significantly toxic, in contrast to the non-metabolisable analogues methylated PA (MePA) and methylated OA (MeOA). Fatty acids with a chain length  < C16 were not toxic in EndoC-βH1 beta cells. Caspase-3 was also activated by linoleic  (LA)(C18:2) but not by γ- (γ-LNA)(C18:3). Overall, only long-chain FFAs with chain lengths  > C14, which generate hydrogen peroxide in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation, were toxic. This conclusion is also supported by the toxicity of the branched-chain FFA pristanic , which is exclusively metabolised in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation. The lack of a protective effect of the monounsaturated fatty  OA has important consequences for a beta-cell protective lipid composition of a diet. A cardioprotective diet with a high OA content does not fulfil this requirement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29441023>Comparison of Fatty  and Gene Profiles in Skeletal Muscle in Normal and Obese C57BL/6J Mice before and after Blunt Muscle Injury.</a></h2><p>Injury and obesity are two major health burdens affecting millions of people worldwide. Obesity is recognized as a state of chronic inflammation accompanied by various co-morbidities like T2D or cardiovascular diseases. There is increasing evidence that obesity impairs muscle regeneration, which is mainly due to chronic inflammation and to excessive accumulation of lipids in adipose and non-adipose tissue. To compare fatty  profiles and changes in gene expression at different time points after muscle injury, we used an established drop tower-based model with a defined force input to damage the  on the left hind limb of female C57BL/6J mice of normal weight and obese mice. Although most changes in fatty  content in muscle tissue are diet related, levels of eicosaenoic (normal weight) and DHG- (obese) in the phospholipid and docosahexaenoic  (normal weight) in the triglyceride fraction are altered after injury. Furthermore, changes in gene transcription were detected in 3829 genes in muscles of normal weight mice, whereas only 287 genes were altered in muscles of obese mice after trauma. Alterations were found within several pathways, among them notch-signaling, insulin-signaling, sonic hedgehog-signaling, apoptosis related pathways, fat metabolism related cholesterol homeostasis, fatty  biosynthetic process, fatty  elongation, and acyl-CoA metabolic process. We could show that genes involved in fat metabolism are affected 3 days after trauma induction mostly in normal weight but not in obese mice. The strongest effects were observed in normal weight mice for , the activating protein for leukotriene synthesis, and , an enzyme substantial for LDL synthesis. In summary, we show that obesity changes the fat content of skeletal muscle and generally shows a negative impact upon blunt muscle injury on various cellular processes, among them fatty  related metabolism, notch-, insulin-, sonic hedgehog-signaling, and apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28333262>Selection in Europeans on Fatty  Desaturases Associated with Dietary Changes.</a></h2><p>FADS genes encode fatty  desaturases that are important for the conversion of short chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to long chain fatty acids. Prior studies indicate that the FADS genes have been subjected to strong positive selection in Africa, South Asia, Greenland, and Europe. By comparing FADS sequencing data from present-day and Bronze Age (5-3k years ago) Europeans, we identify possible targets of selection in the European population, which suggest that selection has targeted different alleles in the FADS genes in Europe than it has in South Asia or Greenland. The alleles showing the strongest changes in allele frequency since the Bronze Age show associations with expression changes and multiple lipid-related phenotypes. Furthermore, the selected alleles are associated with a decrease in linoleic  and an increase in arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids among Europeans; this is an opposite effect of that observed for selected alleles in Inuit from Greenland. We show that multiple SNPs in the region affect expression levels and PUFA synthesis. Additionally, we find evidence for a gene-environment interaction influencing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels between alleles affecting PUFA synthesis and PUFA dietary intake: carriers of the derived allele display lower LDL cholesterol levels with a higher intake of PUFAs. We hypothesize that the selective patterns observed in Europeans were driven by a change in dietary composition of fatty acids following the transition to agriculture, resulting in a lower intake of arachidonic  and eicosapentaenoic , but a higher intake of linoleic  and α-.© The Author 2017.

Synthetic FFAR1 agonists can be used as antidiabetic drugs to promote glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). However, the physiological role of FFAR1 in β-cells remains poorly understood. Here we show that 20-HETE activates FFAR1 and promotes GSIS via FFAR1 with higher potency and efficacy than dietary fatty acids such as palmitic, linoleic, and α-. Murine and human β-cells produce 20-HETE, and the ω-hydroxylase-mediated formation and release of 20-HETE is strongly stimulated by glucose. Pharmacological inhibition of 20-HETE formation and blockade of FFAR1 in islets inhibits GSIS. In islets from type-2 diabetic humans and mice, glucose-stimulated 20-HETE formation and 20-HETE-dependent stimulation of GSIS are strongly reduced. We show that 20-HETE is an FFAR1 agonist, which functions as an autocrine positive feed-forward regulator of GSIS, and that a reduced glucose-induced 20-HETE formation contributes to inefficient GSIS in type-2 .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30145885>Flaxseed Oil Attenuates Hepatic Steatosis and Insulin Resistance in Mice by Rescuing the Adaption to ER Stress.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence has demonstrated the benefits of α--rich flaxseed oil (ALA-FO) against lipid metabolism abnormality in both rodent models and humans. However, the metabolic response of FO to insulin resistance and type 2  is still inconsistent. This study aimed to explore the effect of FO on chronic high fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and inflammation, mainly focusing on hepatic n-3 fatty  remodeling and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response. The results showed that lard-based HFD feeding for 16 weeks (60% fat-derived calories) induced whole-body insulin resistance, lipid profile abnormality, and inflammation in mice, which was alleviated by FO in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, FO effectively improved hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in mice by modulating the specific location of ALA and its long-chain n-3 fatty acids across hepatic lipid fractions and enhancing insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of hepatic insulin receptor subtract-1 (IRS-1) tyrosine 632 and protein kinase B (AKT) ( p < 0.05).

However, average intakes are very low in a large proportion of the UK population. Some groups, such as vegans and vegetarians, purposely omit fish (along with meat) from their diet resulting in zero or trace intakes of long chain (LC) n-3 PUFA. Although the efficacy of dietary fish oil supplementation in the prevention of CVD has been questioned in recent years, the balance of evidence indicates that LC n-3 PUFA exert systemic pleiotropic effects through their influence on gene expression, cell signalling, membrane fluidity and by conversion to specialised proresolving mediators; autacoid lipid mediators that resolve inflammatory events. The long-term impact of reduced tissue LC n-3 PUFA content on cardiovascular health is surprisingly poorly understood, particularly with regard to how low proportions of LC n-3 PUFA in cell membranes may affect cardiac electrophysiology and chronic inflammation. Randomised controlled trials investigating effects of supplementation on prevention of CHD in populations with low basal LC n-3 PUFA tissue status are lacking, and so the clinical benefits of supplementing non-fish-eating groups with vegetarian sources of LC n-3 PUFA remain to be determined. Refocusing dietary LC n-3 PUFA intervention studies towards those individuals with a low LC n-3 PUFA tissue status may go some way towards reconciling results from randomised controlled trials with the epidemiological evidence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29698923>Anti-inflammatory effects of α- in M1-like macrophages are associated with enhanced production of oxylipins from α- and linoleic .</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammation, mediated in large part by proinflammatory macrophage populations, contributes directly to the induction and perpetuation of metabolic diseases, including obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 . Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can have profound effects on inflammation through the formation of bioactive oxygenated metabolites called oxylipins. The objective of this study was to determine if exposure to the dietary omega-3 PUFA α- (ALA) can dampen the inflammatory properties of classically activated (M1-like) macrophages derived from the human THP-1 cell line and to examine the accompanying alterations in oxylipin secretion. We find that ALA treatment leads to a reduction in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α production. Although ALA is known to be converted to longer-chain PUFAs eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), DHA oxylipins were reduced overall by ALA treatment, as was LPS-induced secretion of EPA oxylipins. In contrast, we observed profound increases in oxylipins directly derived from ALA. Lipoxygenase products of linoleic  were also dramatically increased, and LPS-induced production of AA oxylipins, particularly prostaglandin D2, was reduced. These results suggest that ALA may act to dampen the inflammatory phenotype of M1-like macrophages by a unique set of mechanisms distinct from those used by the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. Thus, there is strong rationale for investigating the functions of ALA oxylipins and lesser-known LA oxylipins since they hold promise as anti-inflammatory agents.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The FADS2 product introduces a double bond at the Δ6, Δ4 and Δ8 positions by acting on at least ten substrates, including 16:0, 18:2n-6, and 18:3n-3. Our aim was to characterize the competition for accessing FADS2 mediated Δ6 desaturation between 16:0 and the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the human diet, 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3, to evaluate whether competition may be relevant in other tissues and thus linked to metabolic abnormalities associated with FADS2 or fatty  levels. MCF7 cells stably transformed with FADS2 biosynthesize 16:1n-10 from exogenous 16:0 in preference to 16:1n-7, the immediate product of SCD highly expressed in cancer cell lines, and 16:1n-9 via partial β-oxidation of 18:1n-9. Increasing availability of 18:2n-6 or 18:3n-3 resulted in decreased bioconversion of 16:0 to 16:1n-10, simultaneously increasing the levels of highly unsaturated products. FADS2 cells accumulate the desaturation-elongation products 20:3n-6 and 20:4n-3 in preference to the immediate desaturation products 18:3n-6 and 18:4n-3 implying prompt/coupled elongation of the nascent desaturation products. MCF7 cells incorporate newly synthesized 16:1n-10 into phospholipids. These data suggest that excess 16:0 due to, for instance, de novo lipogenesis from high carbohydrate or alcohol consumption, inhibits synthesis of highly unsaturated fatty acids, and may in part explain why supplemental preformed EPA and DHA in some studies improves insulin resistance and other factors related to  and metabolic syndrome aggravated by excess calorie consumption.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The -308A allele carriers also had lower levels of plasma palmitoleic  (P=0·009), oleic  (P=0·039), total MUFA (P=0·014), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) activity index-16 (P=0·007), SCD-18 (P=0·020) and higher levels of PUFA (P=0·046) and DHA (P=0·044). Significant interactions modifying the risk of belonging to the INF cluster were observed with inflammatory cluster as outcome between -857C/T and plasma α- (P=0·026), and also between -308G/A and plasma stearic  (P=0·044) and total SFA (P=0·040). Our study contributes to knowledge on TNF-α SNP and their association with inflammatory biomarker levels, plasma FA and the interaction among them, of particular interest for the Brazilian population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29145851>ALA/LA ameliorates glucose toxicity on HK-2 cells by attenuating oxidative stress and apoptosis through the ROS/p38/TGF-β pathway.</a></h2><p>Growing evidence indicates that oxidative stress (OS) plays a pivotal role in Diabetic nephropathy (DN). In a previous study we demonstrated that ALA/LA protected HK-2 cells against high glucose-induced cytotoxicity. So we aimed to establish the glucose injury model of HK-2 cells and investigate the beneficial effects of ALA/LA on high glucose-induced excessive production of TGF-β1 and the possible mechanisms mediating the effects.The expression of OS markers in high glucose-induced HK-2 cells treated with ALA/LA., including the antioxidant enzymes and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, as well as the apoptosis rate were assayed by ELISA and flow cytometry. The p38/transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signal pathway were measured by real-time RT-PCR and western blot.The modeling condition of glucose toxicity on HK-2 cells was at the glucose concentration of 40.9 mM. ALA/LA can significantly increase the activities of antioxidant enzymes and decrease ROS production stimulated by high glucose. The study also found that ALA/LA caused a decrease in the apoptosis rate and TGF-β level of HK-2 cells under high glucose stress through the ROS/p38 pathway.ALA/LA exerts protective effects in vitro through inhibition of ROS generation, down regulation of the activation of the p38MAPK pathway and the expression of TGF-β in HK-2 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29849178>Effect of supplementation with flaxseed oil and different doses of fish oil for 2 weeks on plasma phosphatidylcholine fatty acids in young women.</a></h2><p>Although assumed, it remains unclear that fatty  (FA) biomarkers of n-3 long-chain PUFA reflect wide ranges of intake. However, to be utilised as biomarkers, to predict dietary intake, dose-response curves that cover a spectrum of intakes are required. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the FA composition of plasma phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a sensitive biomarker of n-3 FAs from fish oil, across a range of supplementation doses, and  (ALA) supplementation, in young, healthy women.A total of 303 young women were randomised to intakes ranging between 0.33 and 4.50 g EPA+DHA/day from fish oil (not all doses used in each year) or flaxseed oil (5.90-6.60 g/d) daily for 14 days in a series of trials, over 5 years. Fasting blood was collected at baseline (day 0) and day 14 and plasma PC FA composition, total and HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations measured.Fourteen days supplementation with fish oil significantly (P < 0.01) increased, in a dose-dependent fashion, plasma PC EPA, DPA and DHA at all doses except 1 and 3 mL/day. For the combined group of women who consumed any fish oil there was a 16% (P < 0.01) decrease in plasma triacylglycerol concentrations after 14 days supplementation. Flaxseed oil supplementation for 14 day resulted in significant (P < 0.01) increases in ALA, EPA and DPA, whilst DHA remained unchanged.Our data demonstrate plasma PC is a sensitive biomarker of n-3 FA intake and reflects changes within 14 days across a range of intakes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30683848>The effect of different sources of fish and camelina sativa oil on immune cell and adipose tissue mRNA expression in subjects with abnormal fasting glucose metabolism: a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Molecular mechanisms linking fish and vegetable oil intakes to their healthy metabolic effects may involve attenuation of inflammation. Our primary aim was to examine in a randomized controlled setting whether diets enriched in fatty fish (FF), lean fish (LF) or ALA-rich camelina sativa oil (CSO) differ in their effects on the mRNA expression response of selected inflammation-related genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in subjects with impaired fasting glucose.Samples from 72 participants randomized to one of the following 12-week intervention groups, FF (n = 19), LF (n = 19), CSO (n = 17) or a control group (n = 17), were available for the PBMC study. For SAT, 39 samples (n = 8, n = 10, n = 9, n = 12, respectively) were available. The mRNA expression was measured at baseline and 12 weeks by TaqMan® Low Density Array.In PBMCs, LF decreased ICAM1 mRNA expression (P < 0.05), which was different (P = 0.06, Bonferroni correction) from the observed increase in the FF group (P < 0.05). Also, compared to the control group, LF decreased ICAM1 mRNA expression (P < 0.05). Moreover, the change in ICAM1 mRNA expression correlated positively with the intake of FF (P < 0.05) and negatively with the intake of LF (P < 0.05), independently of study group. A diet enriched in CSO, a rich source of  (ALA), decreased PBMC IFNG mRNA expression (P < 0.01). The intake of CSO in the CSO group, but not the increase in plasma ALA proportions, correlated inversely with the IFNG mRNA expression in PBMCs (P = 0.08). In SAT, when compared with the control group, the effect of FF on decreasing IL1RN mRNA expression was significant (P < 0.03).We propose that CSO intake may partly exert its benefits through immuno-inflammatory molecular regulation in PBMCs, while modulation of ICAM1 expression, an endothelial/vascular-related gene, may be more dependent on the type of fish consumed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27732912>The proportion of total C18:1 trans-fatty acids in red blood cell membranes relates to carotid plaque prevalence.</a></h2><p>Consistent evidence supports the pro-atherogenic properties of dietary trans-fatty acids (TFAs). However, there are no clinical data on TFA intake and atheroma plaque. We cross sectionally investigated whether the proportion of total C18:1 TFA in red blood cells (RBCs), which mirrors dietary TFA intake, independently relates to carotid plaque prevalence in subjects with new-onset type 2  without prior cardiovascular disease (n=101, 56% men, mean age 61 years) and age- and sex-matched controls (n=96). RBC fatty  composition was determined by gas chromatography. Plaque (defined as carotid intima-media thickness ≥1.5 mm) was sonographically assessed at three bilateral carotid segments. In multivariate models adjusting for group ( or control) and classical cardiovascular risk factors, for each 0.1% increase in RBC total C18:1 TFA isomers, plaque prevalence increased by 53% (P=.002). In contrast, for each 0.1% increase in RBC , the vegetable omega-3 fatty , plaque prevalence decreased by 43% (P<.001). We conclude that the RBC membrane proportion of total C18:1 TFA, considered a proxy of intake, directly relates to the ultrasound feature that best predicts future cardiovascular events.

Treatment with high doses of pharmacologic-grade omega-3 fatty  (n-3FA) supplements achieves significant reductions in triglycerides (TG), non-high-density lipoprotein- (non-HDL-) and TG-rich lipoprotein- (TRL-) cholesterol levels. n-3FA supplements have significant effects on markers of atherosclerosis risk including endothelial function, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, cellular and humoral markers of inflammation, hemodynamic factors, and plaque stabilization. This review summarizes the lipid and cardiometabolic effects of prescription-grade n-3FAs and will discuss clinical trials, national/organizational guidelines, and expert opinion on the impact of supplemental n-3FAs on CV health and disease.Clinical trial evidence supports use of n-3FAs in individuals with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), but the data either does not support or is lacking for other types of cardiometabolic risk including prevention of stroke, treatment in patients with heart failure,  and prediabetes, and for primary prevention in the general population. Despite inconsistent findings to support widespread benefit, there is persistent population-wide enthusiasm for n-3FA as a dietary supplement for its cardiometabolic benefits. Fortunately, there are ongoing clinical trials to assess whether the lipid/lipoprotein benefits may be extended to other at-risk populations and whether lower-dose therapy may provide background benefit for primary prevention of ASCVD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26964726>Predictive value of serum dihomo-γ- level and estimated Δ-5 desaturase activity in patients with hepatic steatosis.</a></h2><p>Hepatic steatosis is considered one of the features of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) metabolism is modulated in obesity. However, it has yet to be fully elucidated whether a serum PUFA profile is associated with hepatic steatosis.We aimed to clarify the relationship between a serum PUFA profile and liver lipid content.A cross-sectional study was conducted on 288 patients with dyslipidemia, , or coronary artery disease on statin therapy. Several PUFAs were measured, including eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), dihomo-γ- (DGLA) and arachidonic  (AA) in serum lipids, and Δ-5 desaturase (D5D) activity was estimated by AA to DGLA ratio. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) measured visceral fat area (VFA) and the ratio of CT attenuation for liver to spleen (L/S).The L/S ratio showed significant correlations with serum DGLA level and D5D activity (p<0.0001 for both). Serum DGLA level and D5D activity were significantly correlated with body mass index (BMI) or VFA, and with Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) (p<0.0001 for all). Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that a high DGLA level or low D5D activity was a significant determinant for hepatic steatosis (p<0.0001 for both) independent of BMI and HOMA-IR. ROC analysis revealed that they significantly enhanced the value of MetS-related factors in predicting hepatic steatosis (p<0.05 for both).A high DGLA level and low D5D activity in serum lipids may be useful markers predicting hepatic steatosis incrementally to MetS-related conventional factors.Copyright © 2016 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity.

The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of different drying on retention of bioactive molecules, such as omega-3 fatty acids, total phenolic content and antiradical activity of purslane. Five different dehydration methods including microwave (100 MW, 5 min), tray, vacuum, low temperature low humidity, infrared were used at 55-60 °C for 5-7 h for dehydration of purslane. Three solvents, viz. water, ethanol and methanol were used for extraction of bioactive molecules from purslane. Total polyphenol content, antiradical activity and rehydration ratio of the bioactive molecules were determined. Results revealed that total PUFA, α- (ALA), total polyphenol content and antiradical activity were found to retain in the dried purslane in the range of (47.9-59.9 %), (42.5-50 %), (188-408GAE/100 g) and (33.0-88.8 mg/100 g) respectively. The highest values of ALA, total polyphenol content and antiradical activity were found to obtain in the vacuum dried sample. Rehydration ratio was found in the range of 3.2-4.3 and vacuum dried purslane showed maximum rehydration. It could be concluded that vacuum dehydration of purslane is an effective method for retention of bioactive molecules and good rehydration behaviour of dried purslane.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27207550>Early Low-Fat Diet Enriched With  Reduces Liver Endocannabinoid Tone and Improves Late Glycemic Control After a High-Fat Diet Challenge in Mice.</a></h2><p>Evidence suggests that alterations of glucose and lipid homeostasis induced by obesity are associated with the elevation of endocannabinoid tone. The biosynthesis of the two main endocannabinoids, N-arachidonoylethanolamine and 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol, which derive from arachidonic , is influenced by dietary fatty acids (FAs). We investigated whether exposure to n-3 FA at a young age may decrease tissue endocannabinoid levels and prevent metabolic disorders induced by a later high-fat diet (HFD) challenge. Three-week-old mice received a 5% lipid diet containing lard, lard plus safflower oil, or lard plus linseed oil for 10 weeks. Then, mice were challenged with a 30% lard diet for 10 additional weeks. A low n-6/n-3 FA ratio in the early diet induces a marked decrease in liver endocannabinoid levels. A similar reduction was observed in transgenic Fat-1 mice, which exhibit high tissue levels of n-3 FA compared with wild-type mice. Hepatic expression of key enzymes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism was concomitantly changed. Interestingly, some gene modifications persisted after HFD challenge and were associated with improved glycemic control. These findings indicate that early dietary interventions based on n-3 FA may represent an alternative strategy to drugs for reducing endocannabinoid tone and improving metabolic parameters in the metabolic syndrome.© 2016 by the American  Association.

The genotypes of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of FADS2 gene were determined using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Other biochemical parameters were measured in the serum using standard analytical procedures.D6D activity was increased ( < 0.001) and D5D activity was decreased in T2D patients ( < 0.001) compared to controls. Homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index was positively correlated with D6D ( = 0.34,  < 0.001) and negatively correlated with D5D ( = -0.19,  = 0.02).

In the present study, the effects of supplementation with dietary antioxidants, flaxseed and α-tocopherol were investigated in diabetic golden Syrian hamsters fed with a high-fat diet. Thirty-five golden Syrian hamsters were randomly divided into a control group (C) and four diabetic groups (DM, DM + flax, DM + E and DM + Flax + E). The hamsters received four different diets for a 20-week period, as follows: i) Groups C and DM received a high-fat diet (40% energy as fat), deficient in α- (ALA); ii) the DM + Flax group received a high-fat diet enriched with ground flaxseed 15 g/100 g of food, rich in ALA; iii) the DM + E group received a high-fat diet enriched with vitamin E, 40 mg α-tocopherol/100 g of food; and iv) the DM + Flax + E group received a high-fat diet enriched with flaxseed and vitamin E. The results of serum lipid and oxidative stress analysis suggested that the antiatherogenic effect of flaxseed, α-tocopherol and their combination added to a high-fat diet in diabetic hamsters was based primarily on their antioxidative role, demonstrated by decreased serum lipid peroxidation and increased liver glutathione content. Improvements of serum glucose and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were observed and may have contributed to the prevention of diabetic macroangiopathy evidenced in the histopathological examination. The antioxidant effect of flaxseed was similar to that of α-tocopherol in diabetic hamsters fed a high-fat diet and combined supplementation did not appear to bring more benefits than flaxseed alone. Moreover, the high dose of ground flaxseed alone may have a better cardioprotective effect than α-tocopherol in diabetic hamsters by reducing total cholesterol and non-HDL-C levels and increasing HDL-C levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25789320>: an omega-3 fatty  with neuroprotective properties-ready for use in the stroke clinic?</a></h2><p> (ALA) is plant-based essential omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids that must be obtained through the diet. This could explain in part why the severe deficiency in omega-3 intake pointed by numerous epidemiologic studies may increase the brain's vulnerability representing an important risk factor in the development and/or deterioration of certain cardio- and neuropathologies. The roles of ALA in neurological disorders remain unclear, especially in stroke that is a leading cause of death. We and others have identified ALA as a potential nutraceutical to protect the brain from stroke, characterized by its pleiotropic effects in neuroprotection, vasodilation of brain arteries, and neuroplasticity. This review highlights how chronic administration of ALA protects against rodent models of hypoxic-ischemic injury and exerts an anti-depressant-like activity, effects that likely involve multiple mechanisms in brain, and may be applied in stroke prevention. One major effect may be through an increase in mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a widely expressed protein in brain that plays critical roles in neuronal maintenance, and learning and memory. Understanding the precise roles of ALA in neurological disorders will provide the underpinnings for the development of new therapies for patients and families who could be devastated by these disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29534257>Therapeutic Perspectives on Chia Seed and Its Oil: A Review.</a></h2><p>The attraction of novel foods proceeds alongside epidemic cardiovascular disease, , obesity, and related risk factors. Dieticians have identified chia () as a product with a catalog of potential health benefits relating to these detriments. Chia is currently consumed not only as seeds, but also as oil, which brings about similar effects. Chia seeds and chia seed oil are used mainly as a food commodity and the oil is also used popularly as a dietary ingredient used in various dietary supplements available in the U. S. market. Chia seed is rich in -, the biological precursor to eicosapentaenoic , a polyunsaturated fatty , and docosahexaenoic . Because the body cannot synthesize -, chia has a newfound and instrumental role in diet. However, the inconclusive nature of the scientific community's understanding of its safety warrants further research and appropriate testing. The focus of this work is to summarize dietary health benefits of  seed and oil to acknowledge concerns of adverse events from its ingestion, to assess current research in the field, and to highlight the importance of quality compendial standards to support safe use. To achieve this end, a large-scale literature search was partaken on the two well-known databases, PubMed and SciFinder.

Accumulating evidence suggests that GPR120 activation is a feasible solution to ameliorating chronic inflammation and improving glucose metabolism. In this study we investigated whether ginsenoside Rb2 (Rb2), which exhibited regulatory activities in glucose and lipid metabolism, affected GPR120 expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells, and examined the contribution of GPR120 activation to reducing the LPS-induced inflammatory response. LPS (100 ng/mL) activated the macrophages, resulting in dramatic increases in TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and NO production. Treatment with a ω-3 fatty  α- (ALA, 50 μmol/L) produced moderate reduction in LPS-stimulated inflammatory cytokines and NO production (TNF-α and IL-6 were decreased by 46% and 42%, respectively). Pre-incubation with Rb2 (1 or 10 μmol/L) for 12 h before ALA treatment dramatically amplified the inhibitory effects of ALA (TNF-α and IL-6 were decreased by 74% and 86%, respectively). Compared to the treatment with ALA alone, pre-incubation with Rb2 resulted in a more prominent reduction in LPS-stimulated expression of iNOS and COX-2 and LPS-stimulated IKK/NF-κB phosphorylation and MAPK pathway activation. Rb2 (0.1-100 μmol/L) dose- and time-dependently increased both mRNA and protein expression of GPR120 in RAW264.7 cells, but treatment with Rb2 alone did not exert anti-inflammatory effect in LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells. In RAW264.7 cells transfected with GPR120 shRNA, the ameliorating effects of Rb2 on LPS-induced inflammation were abolished. In conclusion, Rb2 exerts anti-inflammatory effect in LPS-stimulated mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells in vitro by increasing GPR120 expression and subsequently enhancing ω-3 fatty -induced GPR120 activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29877283>Increased Serum Dihomo-γ- Levels Are Associated with Obesity, Body Fat Accumulation, and Insulin Resistance in Japanese Patients with Type 2 .</a></h2><p>Objective To clarify the associations between serum omega-6 (n-6) and omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) levels and obesity-related metabolic abnormalities in patients with type 2 . Methods and Materials Data from 225 Japanese patients with type 2  were cross-sectionally analyzed. The serum levels of n-6 PUFAs [dihomo-γ- (DGLA) and arachidonic  (AA)] and n-3 PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic ) were measured, and the estimated Δ-5 desaturase (D5D) activity was calculated based on the AA to DGLA ratio. The associations between the composition of PUFAs and obesity-related parameters, including the body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, alanine amino transferase (ALT) level, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and body fat percentage, as measured by a bioelectrical impedance analysis, were analyzed. Results Among the PUFAs, the DGLA level had the strongest correlations with BMI (p<0.001), waist circumference (p<0.001), ALT level (p<0.001), HOMA-IR (p<0.001), and body fat percentage (p<0.01). AA was positively correlated and D5D was negatively correlated with several obesity-related parameters, while n-3 PUFAs did not have a constant correlation. A multivariate regression analysis revealed that the DGLA level was an independent determinant for HOMA-IR (β=0.195, p=0.0066) after adjusting for sex, age, BMI, and the ALT, triglyceride, and HbA1c levels. Conclusion A high serum DGLA level was associated with obesity, body fat accumulation, a high ALT level, and insulin resistance in patients with type 2 . The measurement of the serum PUFA levels may be useful for evaluating metabolic abnormalities and estimating the dietary habits of patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29695780>Structural basis for GPR40 allosteric agonism and incretin stimulation.</a></h2><p>Activation of free fatty  receptor 1 (GPR40) by synthetic partial and full agonists occur via distinct allosteric sites.

The relations of ALA and LA intakes with T2D risk were modified by BMI, with significant associations restricted to obese/overweight subjects. Among them, relative risks (95% confidence intervals) comparing extreme quartiles of intakes were 0.55 (0.32-0.93) in men and 0.53 (0.34-0.85) in women for ALA, while 0.71 (0.41-1.16) in men and 0.56 (0.36-0.89) in women for LA.

Namely, noradrenaline (NA) levels positively correlate whereas adrenaline (AD) levels negatively correlate with obesity and/or CDV disease. Western diets, which are tipically rich in Ω-6 fatty acids (FAs) and deficient in Ω-3 FAs, may contribute to the development of obesity, type 2  and/or coronary artery disease. Taking this into consideration and the fact that our group has already described that saturated FAs affect catecholamine handling by adrenal chromaffin cells, this work aimed to investigate the effect of unsaturated FAs upon catecholamine handling in the same model. Our results showed that chronic exposure to unsaturated FAs differently modulated CA cellular content and release, regardless of both FA series and number of carbon atoms. Namely, the Ω-6 arachidonic and linoleic acids, based on their effect on CA release and cellular content, seemed to impair NA and AD vesicular transport, whereas γ- selectively impaired AD synthesis and release. Within the Ω-9 FAs, oleic  was devoid of effect, and elaidic  behaved similarly to γ-. Eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (Ω-3 series) impaired the synthesis and release of both NA and AD. These results deserve attention and future development, namely, in what concerns the mechanisms involved and correlative effects in vivo.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Current knowledge and future perspectives.</a></h2><p>Gestational  (GDM) is a serious problem growing worldwide that needs to be addressed with urgency in consideration of the resulting severe complications for both mother and fetus. Growing evidence indicates that a healthy diet rich in fruit, vegetables, nuts, extra-virgin olive oil and fish has beneficial effects in both the prevention and management of several human diseases and metabolic disorders. In this review, we discuss the latest data concerning the effects of dietary bioactive compounds such as polyphenols and PUFA on the molecular mechanisms regulating glucose homoeostasis. Several studies, mostly based on in vitro and animal models, indicate that dietary polyphenols, mainly flavonoids, positively modulate the insulin signalling pathway by attenuating hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance, reducing inflammatory adipokines, and modifying microRNA (miRNA) profiles. Very few data about the influence of dietary exposure on GDM outcomes are available, although this approach deserves careful consideration. Further investigation, which includes exploring the 'omics' world, is needed to better understand the complex interaction between dietary compounds and GDM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30358922>Perilla Oil Supplementation Improves Hypertriglyceridemia and Gut Dysbiosis in Diabetic KKAy Mice.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study is to examine whether perilla oil supplementation improves glucolipid metabolism and modulates gut microbiota in diabetic KKAy mice.The successfully established diabetic KKAy mice are randomized into four groups: diabetic model (DM), low-dose perilla oil (LPO), middle-dose perilla oil (MPO), and high-dose perilla oil (HPO). C57BL/6J mice are fed a chow diet as normal control (NC). At the end of 12 weeks, mice are euthanized and glucolipid indications are analyzed. Gut microbiota analysis is carried out based on the sequencing results on V4 region of 16S rRNA. Although serum glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, abundance-based coverage estimator, and shannon are unchanged, serum triglyceride significantly decreases in LPO compared with DM. The histopathological changes of hepatocellular macrovesicular steatosis and adipocyte hypertrophy are ameliorated by perilla oil supplementation. Blautia is significantly decreased in LPO, MPO, and HPO, compared with DM. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis shows NC and LPO are relatively coherent.These findings indicate that dietary supplementation with perilla oil can improve hypertriglyceridemia and gut dysbiosis in diabetic KKAy mice, which can be associated with potential benefits to human health.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
