In this study, we explored the role of selenophosphate synthetase 1 (SEPHS1) in the pluripotency maintenance and reprogramming. We found that high level of SEPHS1 is retained in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which is decreased during their differentiation. SEPHS1 knockdown significantly reduced reprogramming efficiency, proving that SEPHS1 is required for acquisition of pluripotency. However, SEPHS1 knockdown did not affect the expression of significant pluripotency genes, suggesting that SEPHS1 may be involved in the survival of pluripotent stem cells rather than in the regulation of pluripotency genes. Transcriptome analysis revealed altered expression of the gene set related to the ROS pathway and apoptosis in SEPHS1-knockdown cells. We also demonstrated the role of SEPHS1 in human ESC clonogenicity, and we found improved single-cell survival of hESCs by selenium treatment in a concentration-dependent manner. Our study implies that hSEPHS1 is a regulator of selenium-mediated redox-signaling in human pluripotent stem cells and plays a role in their survival.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It is known that the proteinogenic amino  differ in their susceptibility to non-enzymatic modification, such as hydroxylation, peroxidation, chlorination etc. In a novel bioinformatics approach, we introduce measures to quantify the susceptibility of the 20 standard proteinogenic amino  to such modification. Based on these amino  scores, we calculated different susceptibilities for 116,387 proteins, testing various scoring approaches. These approaches are based on review articles, text mining and a combination of both. We also show an application by combining the score information with a tool for visualization.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is difficult to control the unsaturated copper-nitrogen constructions as well as compare their ORR performance in a similar carbon matrix by a simple but efficient way. Herein, we easily attained two types of Cu + -N 2 and Cu 2+ -N 4 constructions just by etching the pyrolyzed Cu-doped zeolitic imidazolate framework nanoleaf (Cu-ZIF-L) with sulfuric  or nitric , respectively. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were adopted to further confirm the different copper-nitrogen constructions after different  treatment. By comparison, electrochemical studies demonstrate that Cu + -N 2 sites get higher activity for boosting the ORR performance than that of Cu 2+ -N 4 sites. Furthermore, Cu-N/C-H 2 SO 4 acted as air cathode in the Zinc-air battery exhibits an excellent performance and stability.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The receptor responsible for succinate signalling, SUCNR1 (also known as GPR91), is a member of the G-protein-coupled-receptor family and links succinate signalling to renin-induced hypertension, retinal angiogenesis and inflammation. Because SUCNR1 senses succinate as an immunological danger signal-which has relevance for diseases including ulcerative colitis, liver fibrosis, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis-it is of interest as a therapeutic target. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of rat SUCNR1 in complex with an intracellular binding nanobody in the inactive conformation. Structure-based mutagenesis and radioligand-binding studies, in conjunction with molecular modelling, identified key residues for species-selective antagonist binding and enabled the determination of the high-resolution crystal structure of a humanized rat SUCNR1 in complex with a high-affinity, human-selective antagonist denoted NF-56-EJ40. We anticipate that these structural insights into the architecture of the succinate receptor and its antagonist selectivity will enable structure-based drug discovery and will further help to elucidate the function of SUCNR1 in vitro and in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614581>Coordination Complex Formation and Redox Properties of Kynurenic and Xanthurenic  Can Affect Brain Tissue Homeodynamics.</a></h2><p>Reactive  species (ROS) are known for their participation in various physiological and pathological processes in organisms, including ageing or degeneration. Kynurenine pathway metabolites, such as kynurenic (KYNA) or xanthurenic (XA) , can affect neurodegenerative diseases due to their ROS scavenging and Fe ion coordination complex formation but insights are still incomplete. Therefore, we investigated the formation and antioxidant capabilities of KYNA- and XA-Fe complexes by nano-electrospray-mass spectrometry, differential pulse voltammetry, deoxyribose degradation and Fe autoxidation assays. XA formed coordination complexes with Fe or Fe ions and was an effective antioxidant. By contrast, only Fe-KYNA complexes could be detected. Moreover, KYNA showed no antioxidant effects in the FeCl/ascorbic  deoxyribose degradation assay variant and only negligible activities in the Fe autoxidation assay. Coordination complexes of Fe ions with KYNA probably stabilize KYNA in its keto tautomer form. Nevertheless, both KYNA and XA exhibited sufficient antioxidant activities in some of the employed assay variants. The results provide evidence that both have the potential to alleviate neurodegenerative diseases by helping to maintain tissue redox homeodynamics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613588>Electrons-Donating Derived Dual-Resistant Crust of VO Nano-Particles via Ascorbic  Treatment for Highly Stable Smart Windows Applications.</a></h2><p>Traditional vanadium dioxide (VO) material faced severe challenges of low stability in , humid, and oxygenic environments, which hinder its real applications. Here, we report a facile improving process which can enhanced the stability of VO nanocrystals in the environments above. Ascorbic  (AA), as an important antioxidant for organism in medicine and biology, was ingeniously used for enhancing the antioxidation abilities of inorganic material. At the same time, the AA could generate the hydrogen doping occurred on the surface of VO nanocrystals, which enhanced their Antiacid abilities simultaneously. The AA treated VO nanocrystals retain stable in HSO and HO solution and exhibit high durability in hyperthermal (60 °C) and humid (90%) environment. Characterizations and first-principles theoretical calculations confirmed that the coordination of ascorbic  molecules on VO nanocrystals induced charge-carrier density reorganization and protons transferring electrostatically. Then the formed HVO provides an enhancing formation energy for  vacancy and protects the particles from corrosion. This work is beneficial to the VO nanoparticles coated and decorated processes and exhibit good potential for practical application of VO-based smart windows.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606807>Tissue-Specific Peculiarities of Vibration-Induced Hypoxia in Rabbit Liver and Kidney.</a></h2><p>Activity of the energy production systems in rabbit liver and kidney under conditions of unfavorable vibration exposure was studied by the polarography method using a galvanic-type closed  sensor. The rate of oxidation of endogenous substrates by mitochondria was determined by the tissue and was 5.2±0.6 and 8.13±1.4 (ng-atom O)×min×mg protein for liver and kidney of intact animals, respectively. After 21 vibration sessions against the background of inhibition of NAD-dependent substrate oxidation in liver mitochondria, the rate metabolism of exogenous succinic  increased by 44% and then decreased with prolongation of the effect, which indicated impaired function of the respiratory chain. Similar fluctuations of the parameters were revealed in kidney mitochondria, though their amplitude was lower. The study of bioenergetic mechanisms of hypoxia in various tissues makes it possible to determine the targets for the pharmacological action of antihypoxic drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635017>Synergetic activation of peroxymonosulfate by MnO-loaded β-FeOOH catalyst for enhanced degradation of organic pollutant in water.</a></h2><p>In this paper, manganese dioxide (MnO) loaded iron oxyhydroxide (β-FeOOH) was synthesized aiming to improve the catalytic performance of β-FeOOH as peroxymonosulfate activator. The β-FeOOH@MnO/PMS system exhibited excellent performance and its reaction rate constant of  Orange 7 (AO7) degradation (0.0533 min) was approximately 2.3 times as that in β-FeOOH/PMS system (0.0232 min). β-FeOOH@MnO possessed superior properties as catalyst than β-FeOOH, owing to the higher surface hydroxyl density with higher specific surface area, redox ability and electronic transmission rate. Moreover, on the basis of the analysis from FTIR and XPS, it was found that the redox reaction of Fe/Fe and Mn/Mn synergistically activated PMS as well as the generation of FeOH and MnOH accelerated activating PMS in the β-FeOOH@MnO/PMS system. Thus, MnO and FeOOH synergistically activated PMS to reactive  species (ROS). And O, O and OH were identified as predominant ROS in the β-FeOOH@MnO/PMS system on the basis of the result from quenching experiments and ESR. As a result, TOC removal rate was increased up to 22.62%. Additionally, β-FeOOH@MnO exhibited good stability with low iron dissolution and manganese dissolution. Generally, this study proposed that β-FeOOH@MnO was an efficient and environmental catalyst as PMS activator for organic pollutant degradation in water.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, NO and NO accumulation during nitrite denitrification in a lab-scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR) were investigated. Results showed that low pH (< 7) and high influent loading (> 360:90) (COD:NO-N) caused serious NO and NO accumulation. The maximal NO accumulation of 4.96 mg L was observed at influent loading of 720:180 and the maximal NO accumulation of 46.29 mg L was found at pH of 6. The NO accumulation was far higher than the values reported in previous studies. In addition, the high NO accumulation could completely inhibit the activities of reductases involved in denitrification. High NO and NO accumulation were mainly caused by significant free nitrous  (FNA) and NO inhibition at low pH and high influent loading. There were significant differences on NO and NO accumulation at different carbon to nitrogen (COD/N). Low COD/N (≤ 4) could mitigate NO accumulation, but led to high NO accumulation. It is speculated that NO accumulation is related to the rapid denitrification with accumulated electron in anaerobic stage at high COD/N. NO accumulation is attributed to intense electron competition at low COD/N. High dissolved  (DO) of 4.04 mg L was detected during NO detoxification in this experiment, which is speculated to be partly caused by NO dismutation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658614>Inducible Cardiac-Specific Deletion of Sirt1 in Male Mice Reveals Progressive Cardiac Dysfunction and Sensitization of the Heart to Pressure Overload.</a></h2><p>Heart failure is associated with profound alterations of energy metabolism thought to play a major role in the progression of this syndrome. SIRT1 is a metabolic sensor of cellular energy and exerts essential functions on energy metabolism, oxidative stress response, apoptosis, or aging. Importantly, SIRT1 deacetylates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), the master regulator of energy metabolism involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty  utilization. However, the exact role of SIRT1 in controlling cardiac energy metabolism is still incompletely understood and conflicting results have been obtained. We generated a cardio-specific inducible model of Sirt1 gene deletion in mice () to decipher the role of SIRT1 in control conditions and following cardiac stress induced by pressure overload. SIRT1 deficiency induced a progressive cardiac dysfunction, without overt alteration in mitochondrial content or properties. Sixteen weeks after  deletion an increase in mitochondrial reactive  species (ROS) production and a higher rate of oxidative damage were observed, suggesting disruption of the ROS production/detoxification balance. Following pressure overload, cardiac dysfunction and alteration in mitochondrial properties were exacerbated in  mice. Overall the results demonstrate that SIRT1 plays a cardioprotective role on cardiac energy metabolism and thereby on cardiac function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629789>Evaluation of apoptotic potential of glyphosate metabolites and impurities in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (in vitro study).</a></h2><p>Glyphosate is used for cereal, vegetable and fruit crops for reducing or inhibiting the growth of weeds as well as a desiccant for various grain crops. That is why, glyphosate has been shown to be accumulated in humans and animals through ingestion of food of both plant and animal origin. The study aimed to assessed the effect of glyphosate, its metabolites: aminomethylphosphonic  (AMPA), methylphosphonic  and its impurities: PMIDA, N-methylglyphosate, hydroxymethylphosphonic  and bis(phosphonomethyl)amine on apoptosis induction in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs were exposed to the compounds studied at the concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 5 mM for 4 h. We have observed an increase in reactive  species (including hydroxyl radical) and cytosolic calcium ions levels as well as reduction of transmembrane mitochondrial potential (ΔΨm) in PBMCs exposed to the compounds examined. All substances studied changed PBMCs membrane permeability, activated caspase-8, -9, -3 and caused chromatin condensation, which showed that they were capable of inducing apoptosis both via extrinsic and particularly intrinsic pathway. Generally the study demonstrated that there were no differences between apoptotic changes induced by glyphosate, its metabolites or impurities, and observed changes were not provoked by low concentrations of investigated compounds.Copyright © 2019.

Furthermore, the knockdown of CaHSP60-6 increased sensitivity to heat stress. The 60 kDa heat shock protein (HSP60) also known as chaperonin (cpn60) is encoded by multi-gene family that plays an important role in plant growth, development and in stress response as a molecular chaperone. However, little is known about the HSP60 gene family in pepper (Capsicum annuum L.). In this study, 16 putative pepper HSP60 genes were identified through bioinformatic tools. The phylogenetic tree revealed that eight of the pepper HSP60 genes (50%) clustered into group I, three (19%) into group II, and five (31%) into group III. Twelve (75%) CaHSP60 genes have more than 10 introns, while only a single gene contained no introns. Chromosomal mapping revealed that the tandem and segmental duplication events occurred in the process of evolution. Gene ontology enrichment analysis predicted that CaHSP60 genes were responsible for protein folding and refolding in an ATP-dependent manner in response to various stresses in the biological processes category. Multiple stress-related cis-regulatory elements were found in the promoter region of these CaHSP60 genes, which indicated that these genes were regulated in response to multiple stresses. Tissue-specific expression was studied under normal conditions and induced under 2 h of heat stress measured by RNA-Seq data and qRT-PCR in different tissues (roots, stems, leaves, and flowers). The data implied that HSP60 genes play a crucial role in pepper growth, development, and stress responses. Fifteen (93%) CaHSP60 genes were induced in both, thermo-sensitive B6 and thermo-tolerant R9 lines under heat treatment. The relative expression of nine representative CaHSP60 genes in response to other abiotic stresses (cold, NaCl, and mannitol) and hormonal applications [ABA, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), and salicylic  (SA)] was also evaluated. Knockdown of CaHSP60-6 increased the sensitivity to heat shock treatment as documented by a higher relative electrolyte leakage, lipid peroxidation, and reactive  species accumulation in silenced pepper plants along with a substantial lower chlorophyll content and antioxidant enzyme activity. These results suggested that HSP60 might act as a positive regulator in pepper defense against heat and other abiotic stresses. Our results provide a basis for further functional analysis of HSP60 genes in pepper.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642100>3-Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic  attenuated oxidative glutamate toxicity in neuron-like cell lines by apoptosis inhibition.</a></h2><p>3-Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic  (AKBA), a pentacyclic triterpenic  present in gum resin of Boswellia serrata, has been found to possess antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. In this study, we aimed to examine protective properties of AKBA against glutamate-induced neuronal injury. To investigate the effects of AKBA (2.5-10 µM) on glutamate injury in neuron-like cells PC12 and N2a, two treatment regimens (incubation for 2 or 0 hours before glutamate exposure) were used. Then, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method was used to determine viability of the cells. Cellular redox status was evaluated using fluorimetry and comet assays. Annexin V/propidium iodide double staining and Western blot analysis of relative apoptotic proteins were conducted. Based on the results, 24 hours incubation with glutamate (8 mM) increased the cell mortality of PC12 and N2a (P < .001). However, AKBA (2.5-10 µM) enhanced the cell viability in both treatment regimens (P < .001). Also co- and pretreatment with AKBA significantly attenuated lipid peroxidation, reactive  species production, and DNA injury (P < .05 and P < .001). AKBA also restored the activity of cellular superoxide dismutase under glutamate toxicity; this effect was seen to be more significant during the pretreatment regimen (P < .001). Moreover, Western blot analysis indicated that AKBA inhibited glutamate-induced programmed cell death through depressing the elevation of the expression ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and cleaved-caspase-3 proteins, concentration-dependently. Overall, the present findings suggest the neuroprotective activities of AKBA against glutamate-induced cell injury probably by inhibiting oxidative damage and reducing apoptotic cell death.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635029>α-Lipoic  Inhibits IL-8 Expression by Activating Nrf2 Signaling in -infected Gastric Epithelial Cells.</a></h2><p> causes gastritis and gastric cancers. Oxidative stress is involved in the pathological mechanism of -induced gastritis and gastric cancer induction. Therefore, reducing oxidative stress may be beneficial for preventing the development of -associated gastric diseases. Nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a crucial regulator for the expression of antioxidant enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which protects cells from oxidative injury. α-Lipoic  (α-LA), a naturally occurring dithiol, shows antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in various cells. In the present study, we examined the mechanism by which α-LA activates the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukine-8 (IL-8), and reduces reactive  species (ROS) in -infected AGS cells. α-LA increased the level of phosphorylated and nuclear-translocated Nrf2 by decreasing the amount of Nrf2 sequestered in the cytoplasm by complex formation with Kelch-like ECH1-associated protein 1 (KEAP 1). By using exogenous inhibitors targeting Nrf2 and HO-1, we showed that up-regulation of activated Nrf2 and of HO-1 results in the α-LA-induced suppression of interleukin 8 (IL-8) and ROS. Consumption of α-LA-rich foods may prevent the development of -associated gastric diseases by decreasing ROS-mediated IL-8 expression in gastric epithelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632961>NFκB/Orai1 Facilitates Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress by Oxidative Stress in the Pathogenesis of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Non-esterified fatty  (NEFAs) promote  lipogenesis, which caused abnormal hepatic lipid accumulation, by the NFκB-Orai1 pathway. Oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress have been recognized as key mechanisms in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis. Whether Orai1 facilitates ER stress by oxidative stress remains unknown. The rat model of NAFLD was constructed by feeding high-fat diet (HFD). BRL-3A cells were treated with NEFAs, Orai1inhibtor BTP2, NFκB inhibitor wogonin, or small interfering Orai (siOrai) 1, respectively. The content of intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA), indicating oxidative stress, was measured by a spectrophotometer. ER stress major proteins PERK, IRE1, ATF6, CHOP, and GRP78 were quantified using Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses. For the intracellular location of reactive  species (ROS) and Orai1 were measured by Western blot and immunofluorescence, and cytosolic Ca was measured by flow cytometry. As we expected, the liver of rats with NAFLD showed lipid droplets in HE and Oil Red O. The decreased GSH and increased MDA were found in rats fed with HFD. ER stress major proteins PERK, IRE1, ATF6, GRP78, and CHOP were significantly increased in the HFD group. In BRL-3A cells, GSH content dramatically decreased from 1 h, MDA content dramatically increased from 3 h, and expression levels of ER stress significantly increased from 3 h by NEFA treatment. Furthermore, cytosolic Ca increased from 0.5 h by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells. It indicated that NEFAs increased cytosolic Ca to induce oxidative stress, thus ER stress. The content of oxidative stress and ER stress proteins showed the same trends by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells. These effects were reversed by the Orai1 inhibitor BTP2 and the NFκB inhibitor wogonin. Moreover, siOrai1 abrogated NEFAs' influence in BRL-3A cells. Last, ROS was found by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells, and NEFA treatment enhanced the nuclear localization of NF-κB p65 and ORAI1. It was considered that high NEFAs increased cytosolic Ca and enhanced NFκB-dependent SOCE and its moiety protein Orai1 to decrease GSH and thus induced oxidative stress at earlier stages and furthermore tempted ER stress in the pathologic progress of NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Li, Zou, Guo, Zhang, Xia, Zhang, Yang and Xu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622794>Implementation of artificial neural network model for continuous hydrogen production using confectionery wastewater.</a></h2><p>In the present study, an artificial neural network (ANN) was implemented to estimate the hydrogen production from confectionery wastewater.

Nanocomposites were created by evaporation of the water-albumin dispersion with nanotubes using diode laser with temperature control. Two types of nanotubes were used. SWCNT I were synthesized using the electric arc method, SWCNT II were synthesized using the gas phase method. SWCNT I had a diameter and length less than SWCNT II. The mechanism of interaction between BSA and SWCNT in solid nanocomposites is considered. An experimental and theoretical studies of the interaction between aspartic (Asp) and glutamic (Glu) amino  located on the outer surface of BSA and nanotubes using of vibrational spectroscopy (Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy) was carried out. The possibility of nanotubes functionalization by  atoms of negative amino  residues Asp and Glu, which are on the outer surface of BSA, is shown by molecular modeling. The formation of covalent bonds between BSA and SWCNT in nanocomposites with different concentrations of nanotubes (0.01, 0.1 and 1 g/l) was confirmed by vibrational spectra. The covalent interaction between BSA with SWCNT under the laser irradiation leads to the conformational changes in the secondary and tertiary structures of albumin. This is confirmed by a significant decrease in the intensity of the absorption bands in the high-frequency region. The calculation of the vibrational spectra of the three Glycine:Glycine, Glutamic :Threonine and Aspartic :Lysine complexes, which take into account hydrogen, ion-dipole and ion-ion bonds, showed that a disturbance in the intermolecular interaction between amino  residues led to significant decrease in the intensity of absorption bands in the region of stretching vibrations bonds OH and NH. From the Raman spectra, it was found that a significant number of defects in SWCNT is caused by the covalent attachment of  atoms to the graphene surface of nanotubes. An increase in the diameter of nanotubes (4 nm) has practically no effect on the absorption spectrum of nanocomposite, while measuring the concentration of SWCNT affects the FTIR spectra. This confirmed the hydrophobic interaction between BSA and SWCNT. Thus, it was shown that BSA solid nanocomposites with CNTs can interact either with the help of hydrophobic forces or with the formation of covalent bonds, which depends on the diameter of the used nanotubes. The viability of connective fibroblast tissue cells on nanocomposites with both types of SWCNT was demonstrated. It was found that nanocomposites based on SWCNT I provide slightly better compatibility of their structure with fibroblasts. It allows to achieve better cell adhesion to the nanocomposite surface. These criteria make extensive use of scaffold nanocomposites in biomedicine, depending on the requirements for their quality and application.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It is industrially produced by chemical route; however, a more economical and environmentally friendly production process is of interest. In this context, this study aimed to select wild yeasts able to produce xylitol and compare their performance in sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate. For this, 960 yeast strains, isolated from soil, wood, and insects have been prospected and selected for the ability to grow on defined medium containing xylose as the sole carbon source. A total of 42 yeasts was selected and their profile of sugar consumption and metabolite production were analyzed in microscale fermentation. The six best xylose-consuming strains were molecularly identified as  spp The fermentative kinetics comparisons on defined medium and on sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate showed physiological differences among these strains. Production yields vary from Y = 0.25 g/g to Y = 0.34 g/g in defined medium and from Y = 0.41 g/g to Y = 0.60 g/g in the hydrolysate. Then, the xylitol production performance of the best xylose-consuming strain obtained in the screening, which was named   B12, was compared with the previously reported xylitol producing yeasts   A3,  sp.

All the yeasts were able to metabolize xylose, but   740 showed the highest xylitol production yield, reaching a maximum of 0.83 g xylitol/g of xylose in hydrolysate. The screening strategy allowed identification of a new   strain that efficiently grows in xylose even in hydrolysate with a high content of acetic  (~6 g/L). In addition, this study reports, for the first time, a high-efficient xylitol producing strain of  , which achieved, to the best of our knowledge, one of the highest xylitol production yields in hydrolysate reported in the literature.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675578>Flyash augmented FeO as a heterogeneous catalyst for degradation of stabilized landfill leachate in Fenton process.</a></h2><p>In this study magnetite (FeO) was augmented over coal flyash and analyzed for the effectiveness as a catalyst in heterogeneous Fenton process for the degradation of persistent organic pollutant present in stabilized landfill leachate. FeO and flyash augmented FeO was prepared by simple chemical precipitation method and both had magnetic nature. XRD, FTIR and SEM with EDX characterization were consummated for both catalysts. The Fenton experiments were performed in batch mode and to identify the optimal operating condition for effective COD removal the leachate pH, catalysts and HO dosages were varied. The reusability of the catalysts was studied. To understand the degradation mechanism adsorption study, Fenton oxidation of benzoic  and scavenging experiments with KI and NaF were performed. It was witnessed that flyash augmented FeO exhibited 84.7% of COD degradation which was 12.3% of higher removal efficiency than FeO at optimum pH 3, 0.05 M HO and 1000 mg/L of catalyst dosage in 100 min reaction time. This flyash augmented FeO showed 68% of TOC removal and good increment in biodegradability. Poor NH-N removal was observed in the Fenton treatment process. Decrease in aromaticity was found based on SUVA value and also indicated the removal of organic matter. Similarly, reusability and stability were higher than FeO. The results indicate that flyash augmented FeO is a competent catalyst in heterogeneous Fenton process for treatment of mature leachate.

Although high-valent Mn(V)-oxo complexes have been proposed as the active oxidants that afford high regio-, stereo-, and enantioselectivities in the catalytic oxidation reactions, the importance of the spin state (e.g.,  = 0 or 1) of the proposed Mn(V)-oxo species is an area that requires further study. In the present study, we have theoretically demonstrated that a mononuclear nonheme Mn(V)-oxo species with an  = 1 ground spin state is the active oxidant that effects the stereo- and enantioselective alkane hydroxylation reaction; it is noted that synthetic octahedral Mn(V)-oxo complexes, characterized spectroscopically and/or structurally, possess an  = 0 spin state and are sluggish oxidants. In an experimental approach, we have investigated the catalytic hydroxylation of alkanes by a mononuclear nonheme Mn(II) complex, [(-PMB)Mn], and HO in the presence of carboxylic ; alcohol is the major product with high stereo- and enantioselectivities. A synthetic Mn(IV)-oxo complex, [(-PMB)Mn(O)], is inactive in C-H bond activation reactions, ruling out the Mn(IV)-oxo species as an active oxidant. DFT calculations have shown that a Mn(V)-oxo species with an  = 1 spin state, [(-PMB)Mn(O)(OAc)], is highly reactive and capable of oxygenating the C-H bond via  rebound mechanism; we propose that the triplet spin state of the Mn(V)-oxo species results from the consequence of breaking the equatorial symmetry due to the binding of an equatorial  from an acetate ligand. Thus, the present study reports that, different from the previously reported  = 0 Mn(V)-oxo species, Mn(V)-oxo species with a triplet ground spin state are highly reactive oxidants that are responsible for the regio-, stereo-, and enantioselectivities in the catalytic hydroxylation of alkanes by mononuclear nonheme manganese complexes and terminal oxidants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670612>Mammalian transient receptor potential TRPA1 channels: from structure to disease.</a></h2><p>The Transient Receptor Potential Ankyrin TRPA channels are Ca-permeable non-selective cation channels remarkably conserved through the animal kingdom. Mammals have only one member, TRPA1, which is widely expressed in sensory neurons and in non-neuronal cells (such as epithelial cells and hair cells). TRPA1 owes its name to the presence of 14 ankyrin repeats located in the N-terminus of the channel, an unusual structural feature that may be relevant to its interactions with intracellular components. TRPA1 is primarily involved in the detection of an extremely wide variety of exogenous stimuli that may produce cellular damage. This include a plethora of electrophilic compounds that interact with nucleophilic amino  residues in the channel, and many other chemically-unrelated compounds whose only common feature seems to be their ability to partition in the plasma membrane. TRPA1 has been reported to be activated by cold, heat and mechanical stimuli, and its function is modulated by multiple factors, including Ca, trace metals, pH, and reactive , nitrogen and carbonyl species. TRPA1 is involved in acute and chronic pain, inflammation, plays a role in the pathophysiology of nearly all organ systems and is an attractive target for the treatment of related diseases. Here we review the current knowledge about the mammalian TRPA1 channel, linking its unique structure, widely tuned sensory properties and complex regulation to its roles in multiple pathophysiological conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654767>Universal stress proteins contribute Edwardsiella piscicida adversity resistance and pathogenicity and promote blocking host immune response.</a></h2><p>Universal stress proteins (Usps) exist ubiquitously in bacteria and other organisms. Usps play an important role in adaptation of bacteria to a variety of environmental stresses. There is increasing evidence that Usps facilitate pathogens to adapt host environment and are involved in pathogenicity. Edwardsiella piscicida (formerly included in E. tarda) is a severe fish pathogen and infects various important economic fish including tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). In E. piscicida, a number of systems and factors that are involved in stress resistance and pathogenesis were identified. However, the function of Usps in E. piscicida is totally unknown. In this study, we examined the expressions of 13 usp genes in E. piscicida and found that most of these usp genes were up-regulated expression under high temperature, oxidative stress,  stress, and host serum stress. Particularly, among these usp genes, usp13, exhibited dramatically high expression level upon several stress conditions. To investigate the biological role of usp13, a markerless usp13 in-frame mutant strain, TX01Δusp13, was constructed. Compared to the wild type TX01, TX01Δusp13 exhibited markedly compromised tolerance to high temperature, hydrogen peroxide, and low pH. Deletion of usp13 significantly retarded bacterial biofilm growth and decreased resistance against serum killing. Pathogenicity analysis showed that the inactivation of usp13 significantly impaired the ability of E. piscicida to invade into host cell and infect host tissue. Introduction of a trans-expressed usp13 gene restored the lost virulence of TX01Δusp13. In support of these results, host immune response induced by TX01 and TX01Δusp13 was examined, and the results showed reactive  species (ROS) levels in TX01Δusp13-infected macrophages were significantly higher than those in TX01-infected cells. The expression level of several cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, and CC2) in TX01Δusp13-infected fish was significantly higher than that in TX01-infected fish. These results suggested that the deletion of usp13 attenuated the ability of bacteria to overcome the host immune response to pathogen infection. Taken together, our study indicated Usp13 of E. piscicida was not only important participant in adversity resistance, but also was essential for E. piscicida pathogenicity and contributed to block host immune response to pathogen infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Activating endogenous neural stem/progenitors cells (NSPCs), lining in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and dentate gyrus, facilitates injured brain tissue recovery in both short and long-term experimental settings. While, only a few proliferated NSPCs migrate toward the lesions to enhance endogenous repair after ischemia. Here, the results indicated that the functional recovery was evidently improved and the infarct volume was significantly reduced with ascorbic  (AA) treatment in a dose-dependent manner from 125 to 500 mg/Kg, and the suitable therapeutic concentration was 250 mg/Kg. The possible mechanism might be due to activating sodium-vitamin C cotransporter 2 (SVCT2), which was down-regulated in SVZ after ischemia. Furthermore, immunostaining images depicted the number of migrated NSPCs from SVZ were significantly increased with 250 mg/Kg AA treatment or SVCT2 overexpression under the physiological and pathological condition . Besides, the data also represented that 250 mg/Kg AA or SVCT2 overexpression facilitated NSPCs migration  promoting F-actin assembling in the manner of up-regulating CDC42 expression using -glucose deprivation . Collectively, the present study indicates that SVCT2 promotes NSPCs migration through CDC42 activation to facilitate F-actin assembling, which enlarges the therapeutic scope of AA and the role of SVCT2 in NSPCs migration after brain injury.Copyright © 2019 Yang, Zhang, Chen, Wang, Lei, Zhong, Xian, Quan, Lu, Huang, Chen, Ge and Feng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610455>Comparison of humic and fulvic  on remediation of arsenic contaminated soil by electrokinetic technology.</a></h2><p>The use of humic  (HA) and fulvic  (FA) as reinforcing agents to improve the efficiency of electrokinetic remediation (EKR) were investigated for the first time using an artificially contaminated soil. A series of soil leaching tests and bench-scale EKR experiments were performed to elucidate the mechanisms of As removed from artificially contaminated soil. The characterization of total reducing capacity (TRC) and functional group were carried out to reveal the difference of HA and FA. The observations demonstrated that with 0.1 M NaOH and KCl as the anolyte, using both HA and FA enhanced the efficiency of EKR. After 25 days of EKR, the removal efficiency of TAs in HA/FA-enhanced EKR was about 2.0-3.0 times greater than when unenhanced. Compared to HA, more As was removed in EKR with FA, which has more TRC and -containing groups. These EKR experimental results, with the support of data obtained from soil leaching test, indicate that competitive adsorption, reductive dissolution and complexation were the reasons why HA and FA promoted the release of As in the soil and further enhanced the remediation efficiency.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, whether 10-HDA can protect against LPS-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage is largely unexplored. In this study, we first observed that 10-HDA decreased BBB permeability in LPS-stimulated C57BL/6 mice by Evan's blue (EB) dye. Immunostaining and Western blot results showed that 10-HDA alleviated BBB dysfunction by inhibiting the degradation of tight junction proteins (occludin, claudin-5 and ZO-1). In LPS-stimulated human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs), 10-HDA decreased the expression of chemokines (CCL-2 and CCL-3), adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1), reactive  species, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and increased the expression of tight junction proteins. Interestingly, LC-MS/MS analysis showed that 10-HDA pretreatment upregulated the expression of mitochondria-associated proteins, which may reflect the mechanism underlying the regulatory effect of 10-HDA on reactive  species. We further illustrated that 10-HDA promoted the activation of the AMPK pathway and the downstream PI3K/AKT pathway. Compound C (an AMPK inhibitor) and LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) markedly reversed the alleviating effect of 10-HDA on the expression of tight junction proteins, indicating that 10-HDA inhibited LPS-induced BBB dysfunction by triggering the activation of the AMPK/PI3K/AKT pathway. Collectively, these data reveal that 10-HDA may be an interesting candidate for clinical evaluation in the treatment of diseases related to BBB damage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation, which causes skin photodamage, is considered as an extrinsic skin aging factor. It reduces skin hydration, and increases wrinkle formation and reactive  species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokine expression. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the anti-aging effects of an ethanol extract of Oc (Oc.Ex).A UVB-irradiated hairless mouse model was used to examine relevant changes in skin hydration, wrinkle formation, and skin epidermal thickness. Also, antioxidant markers such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were analyzed, and Oc. Ex skin protective effects against UVB irradiation-induced photoaging were examined by determining the levels of skin hydration factors.Oc.Ex improved epidermal barrier dysfunctions such as increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and capacitance reduction in UVB-irradiated mice. It upregulated skin hydration-related markers, including hyaluronic  (HA), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, and pro-collagen, in UVB-irradiated mice, compared with the vehicle control group. It also reduced UVB-induced wrinkle formation, collagen degradation, and epidermal thickness. Additionally, it remarkably suppressed the increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and restored the activity of SOD and CAT in UVB-irradiated mice, compared with the vehicle control group. Furthermore, Oc. Ex treatment downregulated the production of inflammatory cytokines and phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathway activated by UVB irradiation.This study revealed that Oc. Ex reduced skin thickness and the degradation of collagen fibers by increasing hydration markers and collagen-regulating factors in the skin of UVB-irradiated mice. It also inhibited UVB-induced antioxidant enzyme activity and inflammatory cytokine expression via MAPK signaling downregulation, suggesting that it prevents UVB-induced skin damage and photoaging, and has potential for clinical development in skin disease treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661119>Glutamine affects T24 bladder cancer cell proliferation by activating STAT3 through ROS and glutaminolysis.</a></h2><p>Changes in metabolism are common phenomena in tumors. Glutamine (Gln) has been documented to play a critical role in tumor growth. In this study, we aimed to to explore the mechanisms through which bladder cancer cells utilize Gln to fulfill their biosynthetic needs during proliferation. In addition, the roles of Gln in the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle, reactive  species (ROS) regulation, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) expression were examined in vitro in the T24 bladder cancer cell line. The results revealed that the T24 cell line was markedly Gln‑dependent and that Gln supplementation promoted T24 proliferation through the actions of Gln as a ROS moderator and as a metabolic fuel in the TCA cycle. Importantly, extracellular Gln deprivation deregulated the production of the transcription factor, STAT3. Additionally, STAT3 expression was affected by the degree of Gln metabolism, as regulated by Gln intermediates and ROS. Thus, on the whole, the findings of this study demonstrate that Gln promotes the proliferation of the Gln‑dependent bladder cancer cell line, T24, by supplementing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and neutralizing ROS to activate the STAT3 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665431>PAMP-INDUCED SECRETED PEPTIDE 3 (PIP3) modulates immunity in Arabidopsis thaliana.</a></h2><p>Small post-translationally modified peptides are important signalling components of plant defence responses against phytopathogens, acting both as positive and negative modulators. PAMP-INDUCED SECRETED PEPTIDE (PIP) 1 and 2 has been shown to amplify plant immunity. Here we investigate the role of the related peptide PIP3 in the regulation of immune response in Arabidopsis. Treatment with synthetic PIP peptides led to similar transcriptome reprogramming, indicating an effect on innate immunity-related processes and phytohormones, including jasmonic  (JA) biosynthesis and signalling. PIP3 overexpressing (OX) plants showed enhanced growth inhibition in response to flg22 exposure. In addition, flg22-induced production of reactive  species and callose deposition were significantly reduced in PIP3-OX plants. Interestingly, PIP3-OX plants showed increased susceptibility both toward Botrytis cinerea and the biotrophic pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Expression of both JA and salicylic  biosynthesis and signalling genes was more induced during B. cinerea infection in PIP3-OX plants compared with wild-type plants. Promoter and ChIP-seq analyses indicated that the transcription factors WRKY18, WRKY33 and WRKY40 cooperatively act as repressors for PIP3. The results point to a fine-tuning role for PIP3 in modulation of immunity through the regulation of SA and JA biosynthesis and signalling pathways in Arabidopsis.© The Author(s) 2019.

This method is based on the simultaneous administration of [1-C]glycine and [N]glycine followed by the measurement of excretion kinetics of breath CO and urinary N. The basic idea of the DLAAM is that the unknown C recovery RF(C) of the 1-C amino , essential for the calculation of the net CO production, can be approximated by the easily measureable N recovery RF(N) of the α-NH labelled amino . In four healthy adult men (76-97 kg) the DLAAM was tested parallel to the IC and in one man (74 kg) parallel to the DLWM. Using the approximation RF(C) ≈ RF(N) the RCO (in l CO d) was calculated to 387.0 ± 30.3 (DLAAM) vs. 382.8 ± 22.6. (IC). The Bland-Altman plot shows that the difference between the DLAAM and IC of individual RCO is within the 95 % confidence interval (mean ± 2 SD): +4.3 ± 37.5 l CO d. We conclude that the DLAAM and IC may be used interchangeably. The physical activity level (PAL) was calculated based on the DLAAM vs. DLWM to about 1.5.

Hydrogen sulfide plays a crucial role in the maintenance and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) that have the potential to differentiate to a diverse group of mesenchymally derived cells. It was shown that these cells show a heavy reliance on cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS)-derived hydrogen sulfide (HS) during differentiation. We have found that expression and activity of 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST), one of three enzymes that hat regulates HS biosynthesis, is significantly lower in MSC as compared with lineage-restricted dermal fibroblasts. Here, we tested the hypothesis that suppression of MPST in dermal fibroblasts might induce plasticity-related changes and broaden the transdifferentiation potency. Inactivation of MPST with phenylpyruvate (PP) or by siRNA silencing led to diminished HS production associated with increased production of reactive  species (ROS) and lactic . Accumulation of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), a key metabolite required for the expression of ten-eleven translocation hydroxylase (TET), was associated with stimulated transcription of pluripotency related genes including OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, and NANOG. Suppression of TET1 gene and inhibition of glycolysis with glucose analog, 2-desoxy-d-glucose, or hexokinase II inhibitor significantly reduced expression of pluripotency genes following MPST inactivation or knockdown. MPST disruption promoted the conversion of fibroblasts into adipocytes as evidenced by a significant increase in expression of adipocyte-specific genes, PPARγ, and UCP1, and intracellular accumulation of oil Red-O positive fat droplets. Inhibition of glycolysis inhibited these changes. Under induced differentiation conditions, fibroblasts with disrupted MPST show the potency to differentiate to white adipogenic lineage. Thus, MPST inactivation or silencing enhances the plasticity of dermal fibroblasts in a TET1 and glycolysis dependent manner and promotes adipogenic transdifferentiation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Indeed, improvements in modelling gas-liquid mass transfer can bring huge benefits in terms of reaction rates, plant energy expenditure, -base equilibria and greenhouse gas emissions. Despite these efforts, there is still no universally valid correlation between the design and operating parameters of a wastewater treatment plant and the gas-liquid mass transfer coefficients. That is why the current practice for  mass transfer modelling is to apply overly simplified models, which come with multiple assumptions that are not valid for most applications. To deal with these complexities, correction factors were introduced over time. The most uncertain of them is the α-factor. To build fundamental gas-liquid mass transfer knowledge more advanced modelling paradigms have been applied more recently. Yet these come with a high level of complexity making them impractical for rapid process design and optimisation in an industrial setting. However, the knowledge gained from these more advanced models can help in improving the way the α-factor and thus gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient should be applied. That is why the presented work aims at clarifying the current state-of-the-art in gas-liquid mass transfer modelling of  and other gases, but also to direct academic research efforts towards the needs of the industrial practitioners.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606550>Modulation of FLT3 signal transduction through cytoplasmic cysteine residues indicates the potential for redox regulation.</a></h2><p>Oxidative modification of cysteine residues has been shown to regulate the activity of several protein-tyrosine kinases. We explored the possibility that Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), a hematopoietic receptor-tyrosine kinase, is subject to this type of regulation. An underlying rationale was that the FLT3 gene is frequently mutated in Acute Myeloid Leukemia patients, and resulting oncogenic variants of FLT3 with 'internal tandem duplications (FLT3ITD)' drive production of reactive  in leukemic cells. FLT3 was moderately activated by treatment of intact cells with hydrogen peroxide. Conversely, FLT3ITD signaling was attenuated by cell treatments with agents inhibiting formation of reactive  species. FLT3 and FLT3ITD incorporated DCP-Bio1, a reagent specifically reacting with sulfenic  residues. Mutation of FLT3ITD cysteines 695 and 790 reduced DCP-Bio1 incorporation, suggesting that these sites are subject to oxidative modification. Functional characterization of individual FLT3ITD cysteine-to-serine mutants of all 8 cytoplasmic cysteines revealed phenotypes in kinase activity, signal transduction and cell transformation. Replacement of cysteines 681, 694, 695, 807, 925, and 945 attenuated signaling and blocked FLT3ITD-mediated cell transformation, whereas mutation of cysteine 790 enhanced activity of both FLT3ITD and wild-type FLT3. These effects were not related to altered FLT3ITD dimerization, but likely caused by changed intramolecular interactions. The findings identify the functional relevance of all cytoplasmic FLT3ITD cysteines, and indicate the potential for redox regulation of this clinically important oncoprotein.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

This led to the perception of H2AX being a general marker of direct DNA damage with the treatment of other agents such as low-dose exogenous ROS that unlikely act on cellular DNA directly. Cold physical plasma confers biomedical effects majorly via release of reactive  and nitrogen species (ROS). , increase of H2AX has often been observed with plasma treatment, leading to the conclusion that DNA damage is a direct consequence of plasma exposure. However, increase in H2AX also occurs during apoptosis, which is often observed with plasma treatment as well. Moreover, it must be questioned if plasma-derived ROS can reach into the nucleus and still be reactive enough to damage DNA directly. We investigated H2AX induction in a lymphocyte cell line upon ROS exposure (plasma, hydrogen peroxide, or hypochlorous ) or UV-B light. Cytotoxicity and H2AX induction was abrogated by the use of antioxidants with all types of ROS treatment but not UV radiation. H2AX phosphorylation levels were overall independent of analyzing either all nucleated cells or segmenting H2AX phosphorylation for each cell cycle phase. SB202190 (p38-MAPK inhibitor) and Z-VAD-FMK (pan-caspase inhibitor) significantly inhibited H2AX induction upon ROS but not UV treatment. Finally, and despite H2AX induction, UV but not plasma treatment led to significantly increased micronucleus formation, which is a functional read-out of genotoxic DNA DSBs. We conclude that plasma-mediated and low-ROS H2AX induction depends on caspase activation and hence is not the cause but consequence of apoptosis induction. Moreover, we could not identify lasting mutagenic effects with plasma treatment despite phosphorylation of H2AX.Copyright © 2019 Sander Bekeschus et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655487>Free radicals and neonatal encephalopathy: mechanisms of injury, biomarkers, and antioxidant treatment perspectives.</a></h2><p>Neonatal encephalopathy (NE), most commonly a result of the disruption of cerebral  delivery, is the leading cause of neurologic disability in term neonates. Given the key role of free radicals in brain injury development following hypoxia-ischemia-reperfusion, several oxidative biomarkers have been explored in preclinical and clinical models of NE. Among these, antioxidant enzyme activity, uric  excretion, nitric oxide, malondialdehyde, and non-protein-bound iron have shown promising results as possible predictors of NE severity and outcome. Owing to high costs and technical complexity, however, their routine use in clinical practice is still limited. Several strategies aimed at reducing free radical production or upregulating physiological scavengers have been proposed for NE. Room-air resuscitation has proved to reduce oxidative stress following perinatal asphyxia and is now universally adopted. A number of medications endowed with antioxidant properties, such as melatonin, erythropoietin, allopurinol, or N-acetylcysteine, have also shown potential neuroprotective effects in perinatal asphyxia; nevertheless, further evidence is needed before these antioxidant approaches could be implemented as standard care.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619699>Isolation and characterization of an atypical LEA gene (IpLEA) from Ipomoea pes-caprae conferring salt/drought and oxidative stress tolerance.</a></h2><p>Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins belong to a large family that exists widely in plants and is mainly involved in desiccation processes during plant development or in the response to abiotic stresses. Here, we reported on an atypical LEA gene (IpLEA) related to salt tolerance from Ipomoea pes-caprae L. (Convolvulaceae). Sequence analysis revealed that IpLEA belongs to the LEA_2 (PF03168) group. IpLEA was shown to have a cytoplasmic localization pattern. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis showed that IpLEA was widely expressed in different organs of the I. pes-caprae plants, and the expression levels increased following salt, osmotic, oxidative, freezing, and abscisic  treatments. Analysis of the 1,495 bp promoter of IpLEA identified distinct cis-acting regulatory elements involved in abiotic stress. Induction of IpLEA improved Escherichia coli growth performance compared with the control under abiotic stresses. To further assess the function of IpLEA in plants, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing IpLEA were generated. The IpLEA-overexpressing Arabidopsis seedlings and adult plants showed higher tolerance to salt and drought stress than the wild-type. The transgenic plants also showed higher oxidative stress tolerance than the wild-type Arabidopsis. Furthermore, the expression patterns of a series of stress-responsive genes were affected. The results indicate that IpLEA is involved in the plant response to salt and drought, probably by mediating water homeostasis or by acting as a reactive  species scavenger, thereby influencing physiological processes under various abiotic stresses in microorganisms and plants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606785>Exogenous application of β-sitosterol mediated growth and yield improvement in water-stressed wheat (Triticum aestivum) involves up-regulated antioxidant system.</a></h2><p>Water stress reduces crop production significantly, and climate change has further aggravated the problem mainly in arid and semi-arid regions.

Water stress without BBS treatment reduced biological yield, grain yield, harvest index, and photosynthetic efficiency significantly by 28.9%, 42.8%, 19.6%, and 20.5% compared with the well-watered plants, respectively. Proline content increased in water-stressed and BSS-treated plants, owing to a significant role in cellular osmotic adjustment. Application of BSS was effective in reducing the generation of hydrogen peroxide (HO) and hence the malondialdehyde content significantly in water-stressed and well-watered wheat plants. Application of BSS up-regulated the activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, POD, and APX) significantly and increased the content of tocopherol, ascorbic , and carotene thereby reducing the levels of reactive  species. The increased antioxidant system in BSS treated plants was further supported by the expression level of SOD and dehydrin genes in both water-stressed and well-watered plants. In the present study, the application of BBS at 100 mg L was beneficial and can be recommended for improving the growth and yield of the wheat crop under water stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644601>Constitutive expression of an A-5 subgroup member in the DREB transcription factor subfamily from Ammopiptanthus mongolicus enhanced abiotic stress tolerance and anthocyanin accumulation in transgenic Arabidopsis.</a></h2><p>Dehydration-responsive element-binding (DREB) transcription factors (TFs) are key regulators of stress-inducible gene expression in plants. Anthocyanins, an important class of flavonoids, protect plants from reactive  species produced under abiotic stresses. However, regulation of DREBs on anthocyanin accumulation is largely unknown. Here, an A-5 subgroup DREB gene (AmDREB3) isolated from Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, a desert broadleaf shrub with very high tolerance to harsh environments, was characterized in terms of both abiotic stress tolerance and anthocyanin accumulation. AmDREB3 does not contain the transcriptional repression motif EAR, and the protein was located in the nucleus and has transcriptional activation capacity. The transcription of AmDREB3 was differentially induced in the shoots and roots of A. mongolicus seedlings under drought, salt, heat, cold, ultraviolet B, and abscisic  treatments. Moreover, the transcript levels in twigs, young leaves, and roots were higher than in other organs of A. mongolicus shrubs. Constitutively expressing AmDREB3 improved the tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis to drought, high salinity and heat, likely by inducing the expression of certain stress-inducible genes. The transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings also exhibited an obvious purple coloration and significant increases in anthocyanin accumulation and/or oxidative stress tolerance under drought, salt, and heat stresses. These results suggest that the AmDREB3 TF may be an important positive regulator of both stress tolerance and anthocyanin accumulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616386>, a Peroxisome Biogenesis Factor, Is Involved in Regulating Vegetative Growth, Conidiation, Sexual Development, and Virulence in .</a></h2><p>Peroxisomes are involved in a wide range of important cellular functions. Here, the role of the peroxisomal membrane protein PEX3 in the plant-pathogen and mycotoxin producer  was studied using knock-out and complemented strains. To fluorescently label peroxisomes' punctate structures, GFP and RFP fusions with the PTS1 and PTS2 localization signal were transformed into the wild type PH-1 and Δ knock-out strains. The GFP and RFP transformants in the Δ background showed a diffuse fluorescence pattern across the cytoplasm suggesting the absence of mature peroxisomes. The Δ strain showed a minor, non-significant reduction in growth on various sugar carbon sources. In contrast, deletion of  affected fatty  β-oxidation in  and significantly reduced the utilization of fatty . Furthermore, the Δ mutant was sensitive to osmotic stressors as well as to cell wall-damaging agents. Reactive  species (ROS) levels in the mutant had increased significantly, which may be linked to the reduced longevity of cultured strains. The mutant also showed reduced production of conidiospores, while sexual reproduction was completely impaired. The pathogenicity of Δ, especially during the process of systemic infection, was strongly reduced on both tomato and on wheat, while to production of deoxynivalenol (DON), an important factor for virulence, appeared to be unaffected.Copyright © 2019 Kong, Zhang, Wang, van der Lee, Waalwijk, van Diepeningen, Brankovics, Xu, Xu, Chen and Feng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670942>Super-Efficient  Two-Photon Photodynamic Therapy with Gold Nanocluster as Type I Photosensitizer.</a></h2><p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a clinically approved, minimally invasive therapeutic technique that can induce the regression of targeted lesions via generating excessive cytotoxic reactive  species. However, due to the limited penetration depth of visible excitation light and the intrinsic hypoxia microenvironment of solid tumors, the efficacy of PDT in the treatment of cancer, especially deep-seated or large tumors, is unsatisfactory. Herein, we developed an efficient  PDT system based on a nanomaterial, dihydrolipoic -coated gold nanocluster (AuNC@DHLA), that combined the advantages of large penetration depth in tissue, extremely high two-photon (TP) absorption cross-section (σ ~10 GM), efficient ROS generation, a Type I photochemical mechanism, and negligible  toxicity.

Previously, we have shown that low amounts of PRDXs are associated with male infertility and that PRDX6 is the primary antioxidant defence in human spermatozoa, maintaining survival and DNA integrity (Gong et al., 2012, Fernandez and O'Flaherty, 2018). Oxidative stress can trigger different pathway cascades in the spermatozoa, including truncated apoptosis. It has been reported that the phosphorylation status of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and its target AKT (protein kinase B) prevent the spermatozoon from entering the truncated apoptotic cascade. Here, we aim to study the regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway by PRDX6 and assess its role in maintaining sperm viability. Human semen samples were obtained over 1 year from 20 healthy non-smoking volunteers aged 22-30 years old. Sperm viability, lipid peroxidation and apoptosis-like changes were determined by flow cytometry while phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT substrates were assessed by immunoblotting using anti-phospho-PI3K and anti-phospho-AKT substrates antibodies. We found that the addition of arachidonic  and lysophosphatidic , products of PRDX6 calcium independent phospholipase A2 (Ca2+-iPLA2), prevented loss of sperm viability and maintained the phosphorylation of PI3K. Antioxidant compounds such as D-penicillamine partially prevented the oxidative damage on spermatozoa that led to a reduction of their viability. Thus, other pathways can also participate in sperm survival and be regulated by PRDXs. In conclusion, PRDX6 contributes to the regulation of ROS production and the PI3K/AKT pathway for the maintenance of sperm survival.© The Author(s) 2019.

This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of this combined therapy on lung dysfunction following esophagectomy.In this retrospective before-after study, we compared the clinical course of consecutive patients undergoing thoracoscopic esophagectomy treated with the combination of corticosteroids, ascorbic , and thiamine between June and December 2018 with a control group treated with corticosteroids alone between January 2016 and May 2018. Outcomes included oxygenation (arterial partial pressure of  (PaO)/fractional concentration of inspired  (FiO) ratios), duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay.In all, 17 patients were included in this study (6 in the combination therapy group and 11 patients in the control group). Mean PaO/FO ratios in the combined therapy group were significantly higher than in the control group at all points during the observation period (p <0.001). In the combined therapy group, the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay were significantly shorter (p <0.001, p = 0.009).This study suggests that combined therapy including corticosteroids, ascorbic , and thiamine may be effective in improving oxygenation after esophagectomy.

The epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hyaluronic  (HA) are believed to be involved in the focal adhesion pathway function by regulating the adherence of the molecules to the extracellular matrix. However, regulatory and molecular mechanisms through which the EGF and HA could influence the embryo development is not clear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of continued or stage specific supplementation of EGF and/or HA on the developmental competence and quality of bovine preimplantation embryos and the subsequent consequences on the expression and DNA methylation patterns of genes involved in the focal adhesion pathway. The results revealed that, the supplementation of EGF or HA from zygote to the blastocysts stage reduced the level of reactive  species and increased hatching rate after thawing. On the other hand, HA decreased the apoptotic nuclei and increased blastocyst compared to EGF supplemented group. Gene expression and DNA methylation analysis in the resulting blastocysts indicated that, combined supplementation of EGF and HA increased the expression of genes involved in focal adhesion pathway while supplementation of EGF, HA or a combination of EGF and HA during the entire preimplantation period changed the DNA methylation patterns of genes involved in focal adhesion pathway. On the other hand, blastocysts developed in culture media supplemented with EGF + HA until the 16-cell stage exhibited higher expression level of genes involved in focal adhesion pathway compared to those supplemented after the 16-cell stage. Conversely, the DNA methylation level of candidate genes was increased in the blastocysts obtained from embryos cultured in media supplemented with EGF + HA after 16-cell stage. In conclusion, supplementation of bovine embryos with EGF and/or HA during the entire preimplantation period or in a stage specific manner altered the DNA methylation and expression patterns of candidate genes involved in the focal adhesion pathway which was in turn associated with the observed embryonic developmental competence and quality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609072>Avocatin B Protects Against Lipotoxicity and Improves Insulin Sensitivity in Diet-Induced Obesity.</a></h2><p>The effects of an avocado-derived fatty  oxidation (FAO) inhibitor, avocatin B (AvoB), on glucose and lipid metabolism in models of diet-induced obesity (DIO) and in vitro models of lipotoxicity are evaluated. The safety of its oral consumption in humans is also determined.Mice are given high-fat diets (HFD) for 8 weeks. Thereafter, AvoB or vehicle is administered orally twice weekly for 5 weeks. AvoB inhibits FAO which led to improved glucose tolerance, glucose utilization, and insulin sensitivity. AvoB's effects on metabolism under lipotoxic conditions are evaluated in vitro in pancreatic β-islet cells and C2C12 myotubes. AvoB inhibits FAO and increases glucose oxidation, resulting in lowering of mitochondrial reactive  species that improves insulin responsiveness in C2C12 myotubes and insulin secretion in INS-1 (832/13) cells, respectively. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in healthy human participants is conducted to assess the safety of AvoB consumption (50 mg or 200 mg per day for 60 days). AvoB is well-tolerated and not associated with any dose-limiting toxicity.Therapeutic agents that are safe and effectively inhibit FAO and improve DIO-associated pathologies are currently not available.

Furthermore, Rh2HAZnO induced morphological changes of these cell lines, mainly intracellular reactive  species (ROS) were observed by ROS staining and nucleus by Hoechst staining.We confirmed that Rh2HAZnO exhibits the anti-cancer effects on A549 lung cancer, HT29 colon cancer, and MCF7 breast cancer cells. Moreover, intracellular reactive  species (ROS) were observed in three cancer cell lines. Rh2HAZnO induced apoptotic process through p53-mediated pathway by upregulating p53 and BAX and downregulating BCL2. Specifically, Rh2HAZnO induced activation of cleaved PARP (Asp214) in A549 lung cancer cells and upregulated Caspase-9/phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in other cell lines (HT29 and MCF-7). Furthermore, Rh2HAZnO induced morphological changes in the nucleus of these cell lines.These results suggest that the potential anticancer activity of novel Rh2HAZnO nanoparticles might be linked to induction of apoptosis through the generation of ROS by activation of the Caspase-9/p38 MAPK pathway.© 2019 Kim et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649278>The natural compound gracillin exerts potent antitumor activity by targeting mitochondrial complex II.</a></h2><p>Mitochondria play a pivotal role in cancer bioenergetics and are considered a potential target for anticancer therapy. Considering the limited efficacy and toxicity of currently available mitochondria-targeting agents, it is necessary to develop effective mitochondria-targeting anticancer drugs. By screening a large chemical library consisting of natural products with diverse chemical entities, we identified gracillin, a steroidal saponin, as a mitochondria-targeting antitumor drug. Gracillin displayed broad-spectrum inhibitory effects on the viability of a large panel of human cancer cell lines, including those carrying acquired resistance to chemotherapy or EGFR-targeting drugs, by inducing apoptosis. We show that gracillin attenuates mitochondria-mediated cellular bioenergetics by suppressing ATP synthesis and by producing reactive  species (ROS). Mechanistically, gracillin disrupts complex II (CII) function by abrogating succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity without affecting the succinate:ubiquinone reductase. The gracillin-induced cell death was potentiated by 3-nitropropionic  (3-NPA) or thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), which inhibit CII by binding to the active site of SDHA or to the ubiquinone-binding site, respectively. Finally, we show that gracillin effectively suppressed the mutant-Kras-driven lung tumorigenesis and the growth of xenograft tumors derived from cell lines or patient tissues. Gracillin displayed no obvious pathophysiological features in mice. Collectively, gracillin has potential as a CII-targeting antitumor drug.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614143>Neurotensin receptors regulate transactivation of the EGFR and HER2 in a reactive  species-dependent manner.</a></h2><p>Neurotensin is a 13 amino  peptide which is present in many lung cancer cell lines. Neurotensin binds with high affinity to the neurotensin receptor 1, and functions as an autocrine growth factor in lung cancer cells. Neurotensin increases tyrosine phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the neurotensin receptor 1 antagonist SR48692 blocks the transactivation of the EGFR. Here the effects of reactive  species on the transactivation of the EGFR and HER2 were investigated. Using non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, neurotensin receptor 1 mRNA and protein were present. Using NCI-H838 cells, neurotensin or neurotensin but not neurotensin increased EGFR, ERK and HER2 tyrosine phosphorylation which was blocked by SR48692. Neurotensin addition to NCI-H838 cells increased significantly reactive  species which was inhibited by SR48692, Tiron (superoxide scavenger) and diphenylene iodonium (DPI inhibits the ability of NADPH oxidase and dual oxidase enzymes to produce reactive  species). Tiron or DPI impaired the ability of neurotensin to increase EGFR, ERK and HER2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Neurotensin stimulated NSCLC cellular proliferation whereas the growth was inhibited by SR48692, DPI or lapatinib (lapatinib is tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the EGFR and HER2). Lapatinib inhibited the ability of the neurotensin receptor 1 to transactivate the EGFR and HER2. The results indicate that neurotensin receptor 1 regulates the transactivation of the EGFR and HER2 in a reactive  species-dependent manner.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652670>Transcription Factor  Is Involved in Salt Stress Response in Diploid Cotton Species ( L.).</a></h2><p>Cotton is one of the most economically important crops in the world, and it is exposed to various abiotic stresses during its lifecycle, especially salt stress.

During hypoxic events, bacterial respiration causes an increase in carbon dioxide (CO) while  (O) declines. This is rarely accounted for when assessing hypoxia tolerances of aquatic organisms. We investigated the impact of environmentally realistic increases in CO on responses to hypoxia in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). We conducted a critical  (O) test, a common measure of hypoxia tolerance, using two treatments in which O levels were reduced with constant ambient CO levels (~530 µatm), or with reciprocal increases in CO (rising to ~2,500 µatm). We also assessed blood -base chemistry and haemoglobin-O binding affinity of sea bass in hypoxic conditions with ambient (~650 μatm) or raised CO (~1770 μatm) levels. Sea bass exhibited greater hypoxia tolerance (~20% reduced O), associated with increased haemoglobin-O affinity (~32% fall in P) of red blood cells, when exposed to reciprocal changes in O and CO. This indicates that rising CO which accompanies environmental hypoxia facilitates increased O uptake by the blood in low O conditions, enhancing hypoxia tolerance. We recommend that when impacts of hypoxia on aquatic organisms are assessed, due consideration is given to associated environmental increases in CO.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644947>Protective effects of syringic  on neurobehavioral deficits and hippocampal tissue damages induced by sub-chronic deltamethrin exposure.</a></h2><p>Recent developments in the field of insecticide exposure have led to a renewed interest in alternative antioxidant therapy. The present study was to investigate the neuroprotective role of syringic  (SA, 25 mg/kg/day) on the neurotoxicity and oxidative damage induced by deltamethrin (DTM, 1.28 mg/kg/day during two months) in CA1/3 pyramidal neurons. Animals were divided into 4 groups (n = 16/group) (250-270 g) for control, DTM, SA and DTM + SA. DTM and SA were administered by oral gavage daily. Rats that were given sub-chronic DTM had revealed a significant increase in caspase-3 levels, impaired recognition memory, reduced antioxidant activity and enhanced free radicals in the hippocampus. The results showed that SA ameliorated neurobehavioral alterations, reduced reactive /nitrogen species, pyknosis in the CA1/3 and increased antioxidant enzyme activity. In conclusion, SA (25 mg/kg/day) had potential neuroprotective and therapeutic impacts against sub-chronic DTM exposure via its antioxidant and antiapoptotic efficacy.

The adaptations of fishes to deep-sea environment apparently have occurred independently many times. The genetic basis of adaptation for obtaining their energy remains unknown. Mitochondria play a central role in aerobic respiration. Analyses of the available 2,161 complete mitochondrial genomes of 1,042 fishes, including 115 deep-sea species, detect signals of positive selection in mitochondrial genes in nine branches of deep-sea fishes. Aerobic metabolism yields much more energy  unit of source material than anaerobic metabolism. The adaptive evolution of the mtDNA may reflect that aerobic metabolism plays a more important role than anaerobic metabolism in deep-sea fishes, whose energy sources (food) are extremely limited. This strategy maximizes the usage of energy sources. Eleven mitochondrial genes have convergent/parallel amino  changes between branches of deep-sea fishes. Thus, these amino  sites may be functionally important in the acquisition of energy, and reflect convergent evolution during their independent invasion of the harsh deep-sea ecological niche.Copyright © 2019 Shen, Pu, Chen, Murphy and Shen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644277>Physiological and Metabolomics Analyses Reveal the Roles of Fulvic  in Enhancing the Production of Astaxanthin and Lipids in  under Abiotic Stress Conditions.</a></h2><p>In this study, it was found that fulvic  (FA) enhanced the contents of astaxanthin and lipids in  under high light and nitrogen starvation conditions by 2- and 1.2-fold, respectively.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a ligand-inducible transcription factor and plays an important role in fatty  metabolism. Our previous study found that 1-O-alkyl glycerophosphate (AGP), a naturally occurring ether analog of lysophosphatidic , is a high-affinity, partial agonist of PPARγ. In this study, we investigated the role of AGP in microglial activation and illustrated the underlying molecular mechanism. We found that AGP treatment increased the production of intracellular reactive  species and induced PPARγ activation in microglial cells. Interestingly, AGP also up-regulated the expression levels of the cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) scavenger receptor, a high-affinity receptor for oxidized low-density lipoproteins. The findings suggest that AGP induces PPARγ activation, enhances CD36 expression and increases the production of intracellular reactive  species (ROS) in microglial cells.Copyright © 2019.

We show that cystine imported into E. coli can transfer disulfide bonds to cytoplasmic proteins. To minimize this problem, the imported cystine is rapidly reduced. However, this conversion of cystine to cysteine precludes product inhibition of the importer, so cystine import continues into cells that are already sated with cysteine. The burgeoning cysteine pool is itself hazardous, as cysteine promotes the formation of reactive  species, triggers sulfide production, and competitively inhibits a key enzyme in the isoleucine biosynthetic pathway. The Lrp transcription factor senses the excess cysteine and induces AlaE, an export protein that pumps cysteine back out of the cell until transcriptional controls succeed in lowering the amount of transporter. While it lasts, the overall phenomenon roughly doubles the NADPH demand of the cell. It comprises another example of the incompatibility of the reduced cytoplasms of microbes with the oxic world in which they dwell. It also reveals one natural source of cytoplasmic disulfide stress and sheds light on a role for broad-spectrum amino- exporters.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623788>Phenylalanine roles in the seed-to-seedling stage: Not just an amino .</a></h2><p>Phenylalanine is an aromatic amino  that provides the carbon skeleton for the phenylpropanoid pathway, making many diverse chemicals used for structure, defense, and yet undiscovered functions.

This class of drugs is used for the treatment of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Fenofibrate is one of the members of this class of synthetic PPARα receptor ligands. The oral administration of 0.3% fenofibrate caused a decrease in strength due to loss of body weight in laboratory animals when improving behavioural features. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of liver cells showed a genotoxic effect of fenofibrate, due to accumulation of reactive  species, which could be attributed to activation of peroxisomal β-oxidation processes, as well as to the lack of increase in the expression of genes encoding antioxidant defense proteins. Treatment with fenofibrate did not cause brain mtDNA damage. It has been shown that fenofibrate induced mitochondrial β-oxidation in the brain, as indicated by the increased expression of the Acadm and Cpt1a and Ppargc1a and Ppara. The study found no effect of fenofibrate on the increase of mitochondrial biogenesis in brain and liver cells. Thus, we can conclude that fenofibrate significantly affects lipid metabolism in the liver and brain, but in the liver it is associated with an increase of oxidative stress, resulting in mtDNA oxidative damage. However, fenofibrate-induced increase in the expression of Ppargc1a is not associated with an increase of mitochondrial biogenesis.

The amine-terminated Mn-CQDs were then subsequently conjugated to folic  (FA) and chlorin e6 (Ce6) to obtain the Mn-CQDs@FA/Ce6 magnetofluorescent photodynamic therapy (PDT) agent. in vitro studies using three different cells indicated specific targeting of Mn-CQDs@FA/Ce6 to the overexpressing folate receptor human epithelial carcinoma cell line (HeLa) cancer cells. Furthermore, Mn-CQDs@FA/Ce6 enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal with an r /r ratio of 5.77. Favorably, by using the Mn-CQDs@FA delivery system, active Ce6 can reach the cellular interior while its red fluorescence (FL) and reactive  species generation can be retained, as has been verified by confocal microscopy. in vitro cell viability studies verified the biocompatibility of Mn-CQDs@FA/Ce6 nanohybrid with no significant toxicity up to 500 ppm while PDT treatment with 5 min irradiation (671 nm, 1 W cm ) was effective in killing >90% of cells. The light-triggered Mn-CQDs@FA/Ce6 multifunctional hybrid can serve as a dual-modal FL/MRI probe and as an efficient PDT agent to detect and eradicate cancer cells remotely.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657343>[Analysis of clinical characteristics of severe and critically ill influenza A (H1N1)].</a></h2><p>To investigate the clinical features, laboratory results, chest CT imaging manifestations and treatments of severe and critical influenza A (H1N1), and to analyze the relationship with the prognosis.The clinical data of 54 adult patients with severe and critical H1N1 admitted to the Fourth People's Hospital of Nanning from November 2018 to February 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. Throat swab specimens of the patients were determined for nucleic  detection of influenza A (H1N1) virus, and all of the patients were confirmed. The gender, age, course of disease, underlying diseases, symptoms, body temperature, hospital stays, chest CT findings and laboratory results were collected, and the treatments and prognosis were recorded.Of 54 patients, 38 patients were enrolled in severe group, and 16 in critical group. Fever, cough, sputum, shortness of breath and so on could be found in the two groups. The CD4T lymphocytes were less than normal reference value (410-1 590/μL) in both groups. The chest CT findings manifestations of severe group were scattered patchy shadows and ground glass appearance, all of them were cured and discharged after antiviral, antibiotics, and  treatment. In critical group, the time in hospital was longer, the disease progresses varied faster, the shortness of breath was more apparent, and a large patch of fuzzy and real change shadows on both lungs could be found from CT findings.

Nonetheless, their low bioavailability forecasts controversy about mechanisms on their in vivo scavenging activity against reactive  species (ROS). It has been proposed that PC reduce directly ROS concentration. An alternative or complementary action of PC could be the activation of the cell's antioxidant pathway, involving the regulation of gene expression, like that initiated by the Nrf2 transcription factor. To date there is not enough experimental data to support or discard this possibility. In the present study, we evaluated the use of several PC to prevent peroxidation of macromolecules and to elicit the activation of the Nrf2 transcription factor in HO-stresed IEC-6 enterocytic cell line. Synchrotron microspectroscopy demonstrated that PC compounds protected proteins, lipids and nucleic  against oxidation induced by HO. Immunofluorescence results showed that treatment with quercetin (Qc), catechin (Cat) and capsaicin (Cap) induced the translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus, at the same level as did HO treatment, thus mimicking the action of the endogenous cell response to peroxidation. Even though the detailed mechanism still needs to be elucidated, we demonstrated the activation of Nrf2 by PCs in response to oxidative stress.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Artemisinin has been reported to sensitize cervical cancer cells to radiotherapy. In the present study, we determined whether ART and ARM could enhance the cytotoxicity of 5-aminolevulinic  (5-ALA)-based photodynamic therapy (PDT) against the mammary tumor cells of mice. The corrected PpIX fluorescence intensities in the control, 5-ALA, 5-ALA + ART, and 5-ALA + ARM groups were 3.385 ± 3.730, 165.7 ± 33.45, 139.0 ± 52.77, and 165.4 ± 51.10 a.u., respectively. At light doses of 3 and 5 J/cm, the viability of 5-ALA-PDT-treated cells significantly decreased with ART ( < 0.01 and  < 0.01) and ARM treatment ( < 0.01 and  < 0.01). Besides, the number of annexin V-FITC and ethidium homodimer III-positive cells was greater in the 5-ALA-PDT with ARM group than that in the other groups. -acetylcysteine could not significantly inhibit the percentages of apoptotic cells or inviable cells induced by 5-ALA-PDT with ARM. These reactive  species-independent mechanisms might enhance cytotoxicity in 5-ALA-PDT with ARM-treated tumor cells, suggesting that the use of 5-ALA-PDT with ARM could be a new strategy to enhance PDT cytotoxicity against tumor cells. However, as these results are only based on in vitro studies, further in vivo investigations are required.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632848>The planktonic stages of the salmon louse ( are tolerant of end-of-century CO concentrations.</a></h2><p>The copepod  is an obligate ectoparasite of salmonids. Salmon lice are major pests in salmon aquaculture and due to its economic impact  is one of the most well studied species of marine parasite. However, there is limited understanding of how increased concentration of CO associated with ocean acidification will impact host-parasite relationships.

Herein, we report a precisely designed sonodynamic chemotherapeutics which exhibits US-responsive drug release via ROS generation from co-loaded sono-sensitizer. Doxorubicin (DOX)-coordinated titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TNP) were encapsulated with polymeric phenyboronic  (pPBA) via phenylboronic ester bond between pPBA and DOX. Loaded DOX was readily released under US irradiation due to the ROS-cleavable characteristics of phenylboronic ester bond. The size of nanoparticles was around 200nm, and DOX was released by ROS generated under US irradiation. Tumor targeting by PBA moiety, intracellular ROS generation, and combined therapeutic effect against tumor cells were confirmed in vitro. Finally, we demonstrated high tumor accumulation and efficient tumor growth inhibition in tumor-bearing mice under US irradiation, which revealed potential as a multi-functional agent for sonodynamic chemotherapy.Copyright © 2019.

The binary oxides of hafnium present a rich diversity of crystal structures and are of considerable technological importance given their high dielectric constants, refractory characteristics, radiation hardness, and anion conductivity; however, high-symmetry tetragonal and cubic polymorphs of HfO2 are accessible only at substantially elevated temperatures (1720 and 2600 °C, respectively). Here, we demonstrate that the core-shell arrangement of VO2 and amorphous HfO2 promotes outwards  diffusion along an electropositivity gradient and yields an epitaxially matched V2O3/HfO2 interface that allows for the unprecedented stabilization of the metastable cubic polymorph of HfO2 under ambient conditions. Free-standing cubic HfO2, otherwise accessible only above 2600 °C, is stabilized by  etching of the vanadium oxide core. In contrast, interdiffusion under oxidative conditions yields the negative thermal expansion material HfV2O7. Variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction demonstrate that the prepared HfV2O7 exhibits pronounced negative thermal expansion in the temperature range between 150 and 700 °C.

In this study, Mn-AGS was first applied to treat real wastewater (bottom ash leachates) containing high levels of As(III) and Cu(II) in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) for 91 days. Influent and effluent As(III), As(V), Cu(II), as well as pH and chemical  demand (COD) were monitored daily, and sludge was collected regularly for morphological observation, chemical characterization, and microbial analysis. The results indicated that As(III) and Cu(II) could be efficiently removed from wastewater (∼83% and ∼100%, respectively), but the performance was sensitive to pH variation, especially for As(III). The removed As and Cu were mostly bound to carbonates (60.2 ± 2.0% and 70.0 ± 0.6%, respectively) and Fe/Mn oxides (28.2 ± 1.6% and 14.6 ± 0.5%, respectively) in the final sludge. Influent As(III) was partially oxidized into As(V), and high fractions of As(V) were obtained in the Fe/Mn oxide-bound phase. Unexpectedly, microbial analysis revealed that community richness was only slightly changed when the influent was acidized (pH 4.0) but greatly reduced after the influent pH back to 6.0. It could be explained by that -fast bacteria rapidly grew after pH recovery and eliminated non--fast bacteria. This work further supported the practical application of Mn-AGS to treat As(III)-containing organic wastewaters.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The release of reactive  species (ROS) usually initiates lipid peroxidation and resulting in inflammation and tissue injury. However, the detailed identification of the Pb-produced lipid hydroperoxides has received little attention. Furthermore, the mechanisms behind such effects are less informed. Therefore, this study firstly investigated Pb-produced lipid hydroperoxides in human HepG2 cells using LC/MS. The effects of Pb on the antioxidant enzymes were additionally examined using qPCR and their dependent activities. As a protection trial, the ameliorative effects of rosmarinic (RMA) and ascorbic (ASA)  on Pb-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress and their regulatory effects on Nrf2/Keap1 pathway were investigated. The achieved results confirmed cytotoxicity and oxidative damage of Pb on HepG2 cells. In addition, 20 lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) were identified including 11 phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxides (PCOOH), 5 triacylglycerol hydroperoxides (TGOOH) and 4 cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides (CEOOH). The most dominant LOOH species were PCOOH 34:2, PCOOH 34:3, PCOOH 38:7, TGOOH 60:14, TGOOH 60:15, CEOOH 18:3 and CEOOH 20:4. Pb significantly downregulated Nrf2-regulated antioxidant enzymes at both the pretranscriptional and functional levels. Co-exposure of HepG2 cells to RMA and ASA significantly reduced Pb-produced adverse outcomes. This protection occurred via activation Nrf2-Keap1 antioxidant pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, wheat bran protein isolate was digested with alcalase to produce wheat bran protein hydrolysate (WPH) that was then separated into different peptide fractions (<1, 1-3, 3-5, and 5-10 kDa) by membrane ultrafiltration. WPH and the peptide fractions were evaluated for in vitro activities such as antioxidant, renin inhibition, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. In addition, the blood pressure-lowering effects of WPH and the <1 kDa peptides were determined by oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Results showed that the ACE and renin inhibitions were significantly (p < .05) higher for the <1 kDa fraction (84.25% ± 2.45%, 75.19% ± 1.75%, respectively) when compared to the WPH and >1 kDa fractions. The <1 kDa fraction also showed significantly (p < .05) higher  radical antioxidant activity with 2044.73 ± 37.45 (μM TE/g protein) when compared to lower values obtained for the >1 kDa membrane fractions and WPH. Oral administration (100 mg/kg body weight) of the <1 kDa membrane fraction to SHRs resulted in a better decrease (-35 mmHg) in the systolic blood pressure when compared to the WPH (-20 mmHg) after 6 hr. And seven peptides (NL, QL, FL, HAL, AAVL, AKTVF, and TPLTR) were identified and amino  sequence was determined by tandem mass spectrometry. We conclude that the WPH could be considered as a suitable natural antihypertensive and antioxidant resource. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The results of the present study indicate that WPH and its ultrafiltration fractions possess potential as a source of antihypertensive and strong antioxidant peptides. It has been proved that wheat bran has a good blood pressure lowering and antioxidation and other biological activities, and the <1 kDa fraction showing high  radical absorbance capacity level also has better in vitro ACE inhibition and renin-inhibitory activity. The higher antihypertensive efficiency of the <1 kDa fraction may be because the peptides can be better absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract or an increased ability to interact with the enzyme (ACE or renin) protein structure to change the active conformation and lead to decreased catalysis. The results of this study indicate that WPH, especially <1 kDa peptide, can be used as a component in formulating antihypertensive functional foods and nutraceuticals, thus improving the industrial production efficiency and bioavailability of wheat bran.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608254>Intracellular Reactive  Species (ROS) Removal and Cytoprotection Effects of Sweet Potatoes of Various Flesh Colors and Their Polyphenols, Including Anthocyanin.</a></h2><p>The flesh color of sweet potatoes varies based on the antioxidant pigments in the cultivar.

Despite their importance under normal conditions, abnormal overproduction of ROS under unbalanced or irregular homeostasis can cause severe inflammatory diseases. Various antioxidants have been developed in the biomedical field to resolve high levels of ROS; however, high doses of natural antioxidants such as polyphenol can induce side effects on health. Further, synthetic antioxidants are still controversial in regards to their safety and their complicated synthesis. Inspired from our previous work, a nitric oxide-scavenging nanogel designed for treating rheumatoid arthritis, we report herein a biocompatible tannic  (TA)-based nanogel as an effective ROS scavenger. A polymeric phenylboronic -tannic  nanogel (PTNG) was prepared by simply mixing through to the formation of phenylboronic ester bonds between polymeric phenylboronate and TA. We focused on the reaction of phenylboronic ester with H2O2, which readily consumes H2O2 molecules, and applied it as an antioxidant. In addition, TA is a well-known antioxidant, specifically a free radical scavenger; thus, we expected combinatory ROS scavenging effects for PTNG. Various ROS scavenging assays revealed the significant antioxidant effects of PTNG. Under an induced inflammation model in vitro, our PTNG showed high biocompatibility as well as strong anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, in the zymosan-induced peritonitis mouse model, a representative acute inflammation model in vivo, PTNG reduced significant neutrophil recruitment and pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicating successful alleviation of inflammation. On the basis of these results, we suggest that PTNG has great potential as an antioxidant and should find application in the treatment of further ROS-overproducing inflammatory diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611895>Apocarotenoids Involved in Plant Development and Stress Response.</a></h2><p>Carotenoids are isoprenoid pigments synthesized by all photosynthetic organisms and many heterotrophic microorganisms. They are equipped with a conjugated double-bond system that builds the basis for their role in harvesting light energy and in protecting the cell from photo-oxidation. In addition, the carotenoids polyene makes them susceptible to oxidative cleavage, yielding carbonyl products called apocarotenoids. This oxidation can be catalyzed by carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases or triggered nonenzymatically by reactive  species. The group of plant apocarotenoids includes important phytohormones, such as abscisic  and strigolactones, and signaling molecules, such as β-cyclocitral. Abscisic  is a key regulator of plant's response to abiotic stress and is involved in different developmental processes, such as seed dormancy. Strigolactone is a main regulator of plant architecture and an important signaling molecule in the plant-rhizosphere communication. β-Cyclocitral, a volatile derived from β-carotene oxidation, mediates the response of cells to singlet  stress. Besides these well-known examples, recent research unraveled novel apocarotenoid growth regulators and suggests the presence of yet unidentified ones. In this review, we describe the biosynthesis and biological functions of established regulatory apocarotenoids and touch on the recently identified anchorene and zaxinone, with emphasis on their role in plant growth, development, and stress response.Copyright © 2019 Felemban, Braguy, Zurbriggen and Al-Babili.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638792>Label-Free Quantitative Proteomics Reveals the Multitargeted Antibacterial Mechanisms of Lactobionic  against Methicillin-Resistant  (MRSA) using SWATH-MS Technology.</a></h2><p>The objective of the present study was to reveal the antibacterial mechanism of lactobionic  (LBA) against methicillin-resistant  (MRSA) using quantitative proteomics by sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH-MS) to analyze 100 differentially expressed proteins after LBA treatment.

In this work, a hydro-alcoholic extract of manna (HME) from Sicilian  Vahl was investigated using HPLC-DAD to find phenol components and using chemical and biological in vitro assays to determine its reducing, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity. We identified elenolic , tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, catechin, fraxetin, verbascoside, gallic , procyanidin-B1, and luteolin 3,7 glucoside, in order of abundance. Measurements of total antioxidant activity by Folin-Ciocalteu reaction and ferric reducing ability (FRAP), as well as of scavenger activity towards ABTS•, DPPH•, and perferryl-myoglobin radicals, showed that the phytocomplex effectively reduced oxidants with different standard potentials. When compared with vitamin E, HME also behaved as an efficient chain-breaking antioxidant against lipoperoxyl radicals from methyl linoleate. In cellular models for oxidative stress, HME counteracted membrane lipid oxidation of human erythrocytes stimulated by -butyl hydroperoxide and prevented the generation of reactive  species, as well as the GSH decay in IL-1β-activated intestinal normal-like cells. Moreover, in this in vitro intestinal bowel disease model, HME reduced the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8.

The dose (D) distribution in radiation therapy can be measured as a change of the physical measurement parameter T2 using T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. The detection by T2 is relying on the local change of the molecular mobility due to local polymerization initiated by radicals generated by the ionizing radiation. The dosimetric signals R2 = 1/T2 of many of the current polymer gels are dose-rate dependent, which reduces the reliability of the gel for clinical use. A novel gel dosimeter, based on methacrylic , gelatin and the newly added dithiothreitol (MAGADIT) as an -scavenger was analyzed for basic properties, such as sensitivity, reproducibility, accuracy and dose-rate dependence. Dithiothreitol features no toxic classification with a difference to THPC and offers a stronger negative redox-potential than ascorbic . Polymer gels with three different concentration levels of dithiothreitol were irradiated with a preclinical research X-ray unit and MR-scanned (T2) for quantitative dosimetry after calibration. The polymer gel with the lowest concentration of the  scavenger was about factor 3 more sensitive to dose as compared to the gel with the highest concentration. The dose sensitivity (α = ∆R2/∆D) of MAGADIT gels was significantly dependent on the applied dose rate D ˙ (≈48% reduction between D ˙ = 0.6 Gy/min and D ˙ = 4 Gy/min). However, this undesirable dose-rate effect reduced between 4-8 Gy/min (≈23%) and almost disappeared in the high dose-rate range (8 ≤ &nbsp; D ˙ ≤ &nbsp; 12 Gy/min) used in flattening-filter-free (FFF) irradiations. The dose response varied for different samples within one manufacturing batch within 3%-6% (reproducibility). The accuracy ranged between 3.5% and 7.9%. The impact of the dose rate on the spatial integrity is demonstrated in the example of a linear accelerator (LINAC) small sized 5 × 10 mm 10 MV photon field. For MAGADIT the maximum shift in the flanks in this field is limited to about 0.8 mm at a FFF dose rate of 15 Gy/min.

Effect of the METS on glucose homeostasis, oxidative stress, antioxidant status, histopathology of pancreas and also on intracellular reactive  species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential, apoptosis, cell cycleof pancreatic islet cells were studied in diabetic rats.The major phytochemicals identified and quantified by HPLC in the extract were berberine, caffeic , myricetin and ferulic . This result showed that methanol extract exhibited good antioxidant effect. The methanol extract of the plant prevented the diabetogenic effect of STZ and significantly lowered the fasting blood glucose level, glycated haemoglobin and increased insulin and C-peptide level in treated rats. METS reduced apoptosis of STZ treated islet cells by significantly decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL6), intracellular ROS generation, lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide (NO) production and increasing mitochondrial membrane potential and sub-G peak area, enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants.The results revealed that the methanol extract of the stem of the plant possesses protective effects against diabetes and associated complications.Copyright © 2019.

Yr36, which encodes the Wheat Kinase START1 (WKS1), is an effective high-temperature adult-plant resistance gene and confers resistance to a broad spectrum of Pst races. We previously showed that WKS1 phosphorylates the thylakoid ascorbate peroxidase (tAPX) protein and reduces its ability to detoxify peroxides, which may contribute to the accumulation of reactive  species (ROS). WKS1-mediated Pst resistance is accompanied by leaf chlorosis in the Pst-infected regions, but the underlying mechanisms remain still elusive. Here, we show that WKS1 interacts with and phosphorylates PsbO, an extrinsic member of photosystem II (PSII), to reduce photosynthesis and regulate leaf chlorosis in conferring Pst resistance. A point mutation in PsbO-A1 or reductions in its transcript levels by RNA interference resulted in chlorosis and reduced Pst sporulation. Biochemical analyses revealed that WKS1 phosphorylates PsbO at two conserved amino  involved in its physical interactions with PSII and reduces the binding affinity of PsbO to PSII. Phosphorylated PsbO dissociated from the PSII protein complex, and underwent fast degradation by cysteine and aspartic proteases. Taken together, these results demonstrate that perturbations of wheat PsbO by point mutation or its phosphorylation by WKS1 reduce photosynthesis rate and delays the growth of Pst pathogen before the induction of ROS.Copyright © 2019 The Author.

Because the intensity and quality of sunlight can change dramatically throughout the day, various regulatory mechanisms help plants adjust their photosynthetic output accordingly, including the regulation of light energy accumulation to prevent the generation of damaging reactive  species. Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) is a regulatory mechanism that dissipates excess light energy, but how it is regulated is not fully elucidated. Herein, we report a new NPQ-regulatory protein named Day-Length-dependent Delayed-Greening1 (DLDG1). The Arabidopsis DLDG1 associates with the chloroplast envelope membrane, and the dldg1 mutant had a large NPQ value compared with wild type. The mutant also had a pale-green phenotype in developing leaves but only under continuous light; this phenotype was not observed when dldg1 was cultured in the dark for ≥8 h per day. DLDG1 is a homolog of the plasma-membrane-localizing cyanobacterial proton-extrusion-protein A that is required for light-induced H+ extrusion, and also shows similarity in its amino- sequence to that of Ycf10 encoded in the plastid genome. Arabidopsis DLDG1 enhances the growth-retardation phenotype of the Escherichia coli K+/H+ antiporter mutant, and the everted membrane vesicles of the E. coli expressing DLDG1 show the K+/H+ antiport activity. Our findings suggest that DLDG1 functionally interacts with Ycf10 to control H+ homeostasis in chloroplasts, which is important for the light-acclimation response, by optimizing the extent of NPQ.© The Author(s) 2019.

The heated rutin-Lys system exhibited highest brown intensity and in vitro antioxidant activities. The 30-50 kDa rutin-Lys fraction had higher in vitro antioxidant activities than the other fractions, and at a dose of 0.4 mg/ml preserved over 90% cell viability for HepG2 cells exposed to H O . The dose-dependent protective effects against H O -induced oxidative stress of the rutin-Lys MRPs may involve the inhibition of reactive  species generation, enhancement of the superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, along with the activation of the Nrf2-dependent pathway and upregulation of phase II antioxidant genes (including NQO1, HO-1, GCLG, and GCLM). PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Rutin is widely distributed in vegetables and grains. The Maillard reaction is a common reaction occurring during food processing, and produces Maillard reaction products (MRPs) with distinct processing and biological properties. This study shows that a 30-min thermal treatment at 120°C generates antioxidative MRPs in the rutin-Lys, rutin-His, rutin-Ile and rutin-Glu model systems, which can directly inhibit reactive  species generation and enhance SOD and CAT activities while activating the Nrf2-dependent pathway and upregulating the expression of phase II detoxifying antioxidant genes. Therefore, for food systems containing phenolic antioxidants and proteins (such as rutin and Lys), one may enhance the antioxidant properties of these food systems through a 30-min thermal treatment at 120°C. Also, the resultant rutin-Lys MRPs may be isolated and used as commercial preparations of natural antioxidants.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616655>Insoluble and Thermostable Polyhydroxyesters From a Renewable Natural Occurring Polyhydroxylated Fatty .</a></h2><p>To explore the potential of long chain polyhydroxyalkanoates as non-toxic food packaging materials, the characterization of polyesters prepared from a natural occurring polyhydroxylated C16 carboxylic  (9,10,16-trihydroxyhexadecanoic or aleuritic ) has been addressed. Such monomer has been selected to elucidate the reactivity of primary and secondary hydroxyl groups and their contribution to the structure and properties of the polyester. Resulting polyaleuritate films have been produced using an open mold in one-step, solvent-free self-polycondensation in melt state and directly in air to evaluate the effect of  in their final physical and chemical properties. These polymers are amorphous, insoluble, and thermostable, being therefore suitable for solvent, and heat resistant barrier materials. Structurally, most of primary hydroxyls are involved in ester bonds, but there is some branching arising from the partial participation of secondary O-H groups. The oxidative cleavage of the vicinal diol moiety and a subsequent secondary esterification had a noticeable effect on the amorphization and stiffening of the polyester by branching and densification of the ester bond network. A derivation of such structural modification was the surface compaction and the reduction of permeability to water molecules. The addition of Ti(OiPr) as a catalyst had a moderate effect, likely because of a poor diffusion within the melt, but noticeably accelerated both the secondary esterification and the oxidative processes. Primary esterification was a high conversion bulk reaction while oxidation and secondary esterification was restricted to nearby regions of the air exposed side of cast films. The reason was a progressive hindering of  diffusion as the reaction progresses and a self-regulation of the altered layer growth. Despite such a reduced extent, the oxidized layer noticeably increased the UV-vis light blockage capacity. In general, characterized physical properties suggest a high potential of these polyaleuritate polyesters as food preserving materials.Copyright © 2019 Benítez, Guzman-Puyol, Cruz-Carrillo, Ceseracciu, González Moreno, Heredia and Heredia-Guerrero.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663590>Sulfosalicylic /Fe based nanoscale coordination polymers for effective cancer therapy by the Fenton reaction: an inspiration for understanding the role of aspirin in the prevention of cancer.</a></h2><p>Fenton reaction-based reactive  species (ROS) generation provides a new idea for the design of ROS-mediated anticancer agents. Finding ways to increase iron uptake and to elevate the level of H2O2 in cells simultaneously is thus crucial to this strategy. Meanwhile, salicylic  (SA) or its analogue, as the major metabolite of aspirin, has been reported to be closely associated with an intracellular redox-active product. In this work, a PEG-modified nanoscale coordination polymer (PFNC) via the self-assembly of 5-sulfosalicylic  (SSA) with Fe3+ ions has been designed for the first time. The results show that the SSA dissociated from the PFNC can lead to the decrease of GSH and the accumulation of H2O2 in cancer cells, and thus elevate cellular ROS via the Fenton reaction. Owing to such intracellular oxidative stress, PFNC-induced ferroptotic cell death was further confirmed. In vitro cytotoxicity studies show that PFNCs display higher cytotoxicity on cancer cells than on normal cells. In vivo experiments further demonstrate that PFNCs not only possess high tumor accumulation, but also significantly inhibit the tumor growth without obvious damage toward the major organs. Based on the results, we expect that this work will provide an inspiration for understanding the role of SA, even aspirin, in the prevention of cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619228>Tissue-specific responses of antioxidant pathways to poor hygiene conditions in growing pigs divergently selected for feed efficiency.</a></h2><p>Poor hygiene of housing induces a systemic inflammatory response. Because inflammation and oxidative stress are processes that can sustain each other, the ways pigs are able to activate their antioxidant defenses are critical for production performance and health during periods when the immune system is solicited. Selection for production performance can also influence reactive  species (ROS) production and expression levels of genes involved in cellular response to oxidative stress in different tissues. To establish the extent by which poor hygiene and selection for feed efficiency affected redox status, pigs divergently selected for residual feed intake (RFI) were housed in poor or good hygiene during 6 weeks. At the end, blood was collected in all pigs, and half of them were killed for tissue sampling. The remaining pigs were reared in good hygiene conditions during a recovery period of 7-8 weeks.At week 6, poor hygiene was associated with a lower total antioxidant capacity assessed by plasma ferric reducing ability in all pigs, and with greater plasma levels of hydrogen peroxides in the high RFI pigs (less efficient). Adipose tissue of high RFI pigs exhibited higher activities of catalase and glutathione reductase, and greater thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) concentrations when compared with the low RFI pigs (more efficient). Poor hygiene conditions activated the antioxidant enzymes activities (glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase and catalase) in adipose tissue of both lines, but led to higher ROS production by mature adipocytes isolated from the high RFI pigs only. In liver and muscle, there were only minor changes in antioxidant molecules due to genetics and hygiene conditions. After the resilience period, adipose tissue of pigs previously challenged by poor hygiene maintained higher antioxidant enzyme activities, and for the high RFI line, displayed higher TBARS concentrations.Pigs selected for improved feed efficiency showed a lower susceptibility to oxidative stress induced by poor hygiene conditions. This could led to a lower inflammatory response and less impaired growth when these pigs are facing sanitary challenges during the production period.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638999>Inhibition of the key metabolic pathways, glycolysis and lipogenesis, of oral cancer by bitter melon extract.</a></h2><p>Metabolic reprogramming is one of the hallmarks of cancer which favours rapid energy production, biosynthetic capabilities and therapy resistance. In our previous study, we showed bitter melon extract (BME) prevents carcinogen induced mouse oral cancer. RNA sequence analysis from mouse tongue revealed a significant modulation in "Metabolic Process" by altering glycolysis and lipid metabolic pathways in BME fed group as compared to cancer group. In present study, we evaluated the effect of BME on glycolysis and lipid metabolism pathways in human oral cancer cells.Cal27 and JHU022 cells were treated with BME. RNA and protein expression were analysed for modulation of glycolytic and lipogenesis genes by quantitative real-time PCR, western blot analyses and immunofluorescence. Lactate and pyruvate level was determined by GC/MS. Extracellular acidification and glycolytic rate were measured using the Seahorse XF analyser. Shotgun lipidomics in Cal27 and JHU022 cell lines following BME treatment was performed by ESI/ MS. ROS was measured by FACS.Treatment with BME on oral cancer cell lines significantly reduced mRNA and protein expression levels of key glycolytic genes SLC2A1 (GLUT-1), PFKP, LDHA, PKM and PDK3. Pyruvate and lactate levels and glycolysis rate were reduced in oral cancer cells following BME treatment. In lipogenesis pathway, we observed a significant reduction of genes involves in fatty  biogenesis, ACLY, ACC1 and FASN, at the mRNA and protein levels following BME treatment. Further, BME treatment significantly reduced phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and plasmenylethanolamine, and reduced iPLA2 activity. Additionally, BME treatment inhibited lipid raft marker flotillin expression and altered its subcellular localization. ER-stress associated CHOP expression and generation of mitochondrial reactive  species were induced by BME, which facilitated apoptosis.Our study revealed that bitter melon extract inhibits glycolysis and lipid metabolism and induces ER and oxidative stress-mediated cell death in oral cancer. Thus, BME-mediated metabolic reprogramming of oral cancer cells will have important preventive and therapeutic implications along with conventional therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651708>Protective effects of fusidic  against sodium nitroprusside-induced apoptosis in C6 glial cells.</a></h2><p>Fusidic , a steroidal antibiotic, possesses antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, but the effect of fusidic  against neurodegenerative disease-related cell death has not been studied. Here, we investigated the protective effects of fusidic  on sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced toxicity in C6 glial cells. Fusidic  (5-20 μM) prevented SNP (100 μM)-induced cell death dose dependently, and effectively attenuated SNP-induced generation of nitric oxide (NO), total reactive  species (ROS), and peroxynitrite (ONOO). Fusidic  (20 μM) pretreatment significantly suppressed SNP (100 μM)-induced apoptotic events, such as nuclear condensation and caspase-3 activation. In addition, fusidic  effectively attenuated SNP-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers, such as GRP78, IRE1, ATF6, PERK, XBP1s, eIF2α, CHOP, and caspase-12. A specific adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor, compound C (10 μM), reversed the preventive effects of fusidic  against SNP-induced cytotoxicity, CHOP elevation, and caspase-3 activation. These results suggest that fusidic  can protect C6 glial cells against cytotoxicity, through the regulation of AMPK pathway and apoptotic events.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608899>Anti-Colorectal Cancer Mechanisms of Formononetin Identified by Network Pharmacological Approach.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND The network pharmacological approach was used to identity the anti-colorectal cancer (CRC) targets of formononetin (FN) and the molecular mechanisms of FN against CRC. MATERIAL AND METHODS A tool of the DisGeNET database was used for collection of CRC-based targets. Other tools of SuperPred, herbal ingredients target (HIT), and SwissTargetPrediction databases were applied in prediction of pharmacological targets of FN against cancer. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of FN against CRC was obtained by using a STRING database. All top biological functional processes and signaling pathways of FN against CRC were identified by using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) software and Omicshare cloud platform. RESULTS The most key anti-CRC targets of FN were identified as tumor protein p53 (TP53), cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2), and cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1). In further assays, the treatment of CRC by FN was mainly involved in biological functional processes of reactive  species metabolic process, positive regulation of transcription, DNA-templated, positive regulation of nucleic -templated transcription, and positive regulation of RNA metabolic process. anti-CRC by FN of signaling pathways were associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), allograft rejection, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, asthma, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, and others. CONCLUSIONS The anti-CRC molecular mechanisms of FN are implicated in suppression of cellular proliferation and regulation of cancer-related metabolic pathways. Interestingly, 8 optimal biological targets may be used as potential molecular markers for predicting and treating CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657393>The synergistic effects of Cu clusters and InO on ethanol synthesis from acetic  hydrogenation.</a></h2><p>The development of high efficiency catalysts for acetic  hydrogenation to ethanol could ameliorate the petroleum crisis and acetic  overproduction. Cu and In2O3 catalysts both show catalytic activity for acetic  hydrogenation. However, monometallic Cu catalysts are less active in the dissociative adsorption of acetic  through C-O bond breaking, while the H2 adsorption and dissociation ability of In2O3 is weak. In this work, Cu4/In2O3 is designed to enhance the dissociation of both acetic  and H2. The detailed mechanism of acetic  hydrogenation to ethanol on Cu4/In2O3 is explored using periodic density functional theory (DFT). The results show that the H2 adsorption and dissociation are enhanced by the Cu cluster, while the H atom spillover from Cu to In2O3 is favorable on the Cu4/In2O3(110) surface. Additionally, a synergistic effect exists between the Cu cluster and In2O3 surface: H2 adsorbs on the Cu cluster and the dissociated H atoms react with acetic  activated by the In2O3  vacancy. Finally, compared with a Cu2In(100) surface, the Cu4/In2O3(110) surface possesses higher catalytic activity owing to the reduced energy barriers of acetic  dissociation and hydrogenation of the intermediates (CH3COO*, CH3CHO*, and CH3CH2O*). The Cu4/In2O3 catalyst proposed in this work can provide promising guidance for related catalyst design.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658881>Anti-hyperlipidemic effects of Campomanesia xanthocarpa aqueous extract and its modulation on oxidative stress and genomic instability in Wistar rats.</a></h2><p>The use of natural products from herbs may be a therapeutic option in dyslipidemia treatment.  (Mart.) O. Berg (Myrtaceae) leaves have been used to decrease cholesterol levels. However, studies to determine activities of this plant on triglycerides metabolism have received little attention. The aim of this study was to examine anti-hyperlipidemic effects of a  aqueous leaf extract (CxAE) and assess protective actions against oxidative stress and DNA damage. The tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemia model was used in Wistar rats. Rats were treated orally with CxAE either 250 or 500 mg/kg/day for 7 days prior to tyloxapol administration. Biochemical parameters, oxidative stress levels, and genomic instability were assessed in several tissues. CxAE decreased cholesterol and triglyceride levels in serum and hepatic and renal DNA damage in tyloxapol-treated rats. There was no marked effect on the micronucleus frequency in bone marrow. The extract increased catalase activity and decreased glutathione S-transferase activity in kidney tissue. CxAE showed anti-hyperlipidemic effects, improved oxidative parameters, and protected DNA against damage induced by tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemia, suggesting  leaves may be useful in preventing dyslipidemias.

Antifungal and entomotoxic effects were demonstrated for Jaburetox, an intrinsically disordered polypeptide derived from jack bean () urease. Here we describe the properties of Soyuretox, a polypeptide derived from soybean () ubiquitous urease. Soyuretox was fungitoxic to , leading to the production of reactive  species. Soyuretox further induced aggregation of  hemocytes, indicating an interference on the insect immune response. No relevant toxicity of Soyuretox to zebrafish larvae was observed. These data suggest the presence of antifungal and entomotoxic portions of the amino  sequences encompassing both Soyuretox and Jaburetox, despite their small sequence identity. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic data revealed that Soyuretox, in analogy with Jaburetox, possesses an intrinsic and largely disordered nature. Some folding is observed upon interaction of Soyuretox with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles, taken here as models for membranes. This observation suggests the possibility for this protein to modify its secondary structure upon interaction with the cells of the affected organisms, leading to alterations of membrane integrity. Altogether, Soyuretox can be considered a promising biopesticide for use in plant protection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632331>Energy Metabolism and Redox State in Brains of Wistar Audiogenic Rats, a Genetic Model of Epilepsy.</a></h2><p>The Wistar Audiogenic Rat (WAR) strain is a genetic model of epilepsy, specifically brainstem-dependent tonic-clonic seizures, triggered by acute auditory stimulation. Chronic audiogenic seizures (audiogenic kindling) mimic temporal lobe epilepsy, with significant participation of the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex. The objective of the present study was to characterize the mitochondrial energy metabolism in hippocampus and cortex of WAR and verify its relationship with seizure severity. Hippocampus of WAR naïve (no seizures) presented higher  consumption in respiratory states related to the maximum capacities of phosphorylation and electron transfer system, elevated mitochondrial density, lower GSH/GSSG and catalase activity, and higher protein carbonyl and lactate contents, compared with their Wistar counterparts. Audiogenic kindling had no adding functional effect in WAR, but in Wistar, it induced the same alterations observed in the audiogenic strain. In the cortex, WAR naïve presented elevated mitochondrial density, lower GSH/GSSG and catalase activity, and higher protein carbonyl levels. Chronic acoustic stimulation in Wistar induced the same alterations in cortex and hippocampus. Mainly in the hippocampus, WAR naïve presented elevated mRNA expression of glucose, lactate and excitatory amino  transporters, several glycolytic enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, and Na/K ATPase in neurons and in astrocytes.  treatment with mitochondrial uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in WAR had no effect on mitochondrial metabolism, but lowered oxidative stress. Unlike DNP, NAC downregulated all enzyme genes involved in glucose and lactate uptake, and metabolism in neurons and astrocytes. Additionally, it was able to reduce brainstem seizure severity in WAR. In conclusion, in WAR naïve animals, both cerebral cortex and hippocampus display elevated mitochondrial density and/or activity associated with oxidative damage, glucose and lactate metabolism pathways upregulation, and increased Na/K ATPase mRNA expression. Only  treatment with NAC was able to reduce seizure severity of kindled WARs, possibly via down regulation of glucose/lactate metabolism. Taken together, our results are a clear contribution to the field of mitochondrial metabolism associated to epileptic seizures.Copyright © 2019 Dechandt, Ferrari, dos Santos, de Oliveira, Silva-Jr, Cunha, Garcia-Cairasco and Alberici.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624141>Complement C5a Induces Renal Injury in Diabetic Kidney Disease Via Disruption in Mitochondrial Metabolic Agility.</a></h2><p>The sequelae of diabetes mellitus include microvascular complications such as diabetic kidney disease (DKD), which involves glucose-mediated renal injury that is associated with a disruption in mitochondrial metabolic agility, inflammation and fibrosis. We explored the role of the innate immune complement component C5a, a potent mediator of inflammation, in the pathogenesis of DKD in clinical and experimental diabetes. Marked systemic elevation in C5a activity was demonstrated in patients with diabetes which was not therapeutically targeted by conventional renoprotective agents. C5a and its receptor (C5aR1) were upregulated early in the disease process and prior to manifest kidney injury in several diverse rodent models of diabetes. Genetic deletion of C5aR1 in mice conferred protection against diabetes-induced renal injury. Transcriptomic profiling of kidney revealed diabetes-induced downregulation of pathways involved in mitochondrial fatty  metabolism. Interrogation of the lipidomics signature revealed abnormal cardiolipin remodelling in the diabetic kidney, a cardinal sign of disrupted mitochondrial architecture and bioenergetics. In vivo delivery of an orally active inhibitor of C5aR1 (PMX53) reversed the phenotypic changes and normalized the renal mitochondrial fatty  profile, cardiolipin remodelling and citric  cycle intermediates. In vitro exposure of human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells to C5a led to altered mitochondrial respiratory function and reactive  species generation. These studies provide evidence for a pivotal role of the C5a/C5aR1 axis in propagating renal injury in the development of DKD via disruption of mitochondrial agility, establishing a new immunometabolic signalling pathway in DKD.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616440>NK Cell Metabolism and Tumor Microenvironment.</a></h2><p>Natural Killer (NK) cells are characterized by their potential to kill tumor cells by different means without previous sensitization and have, therefore, become a valuable tool in cancer immunotherapy. However, their efficacy against solid tumors is still poor and further studies are required to improve it. One of the major restrictions for NK cell activity is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). There, tumor and other immune cells create the appropriate conditions for tumor proliferation while, among others, preventing NK cell activation. Furthermore, NK cell metabolism is impaired in the TME, presumably due to nutrient and  deprivation, and the higher concentration of tumor-derived metabolic end products, such as lactate. This metabolic restriction of NK cells limits their effector functions, and it could represent a potential target to focus on to improve the efficacy of NK cell-based therapies against solid tumors. In this review, we discuss the potential effect of TME into NK cell metabolism and its influence in NK cell effector functions.Copyright © 2019 Terrén, Orrantia, Vitallé, Zenarruzabeitia and Borrego.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661838>Fatty -Binding Protein 3 is Critical for α-Synuclein Uptake and MPP-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Cultured Dopaminergic Neurons.</a></h2><p>α-Synuclein is an abundant neuronal protein that accumulates in insoluble inclusions in Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. Fatty  partially regulate α-Synuclein accumulation, and mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons highly express fatty -binding protein 3 (FABP3). We previously demonstrated that FABP3 knockout mice show decreased α-Synuclein oligomerization and neuronal degeneration of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons . In this study, we newly investigated the importance of FABP3 in α-Synuclein uptake, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP)-induced axodendritic retraction, and mitochondrial dysfunction. To disclose the issues, we employed cultured mesencephalic neurons derived from wild type or FABP3 C57BL6 mice and performed immunocytochemical analysis. We demonstrated that TH neurons from FABP3 mice take up α-Synuclein monomers while FABP3 TH neurons do not. The formation of filamentous α-Synuclein inclusions following treatment with MPP was observed only in FABP3, and not in FABP3 neurons. Notably, detailed morphological analysis revealed that FABP neurons did not exhibit MPP-induced axodendritic retraction. Moreover, FABP3 was also critical for MPP-induced reduction of mitochondrial activity and the production of reactive  species. These data indicate that FABP3 is critical for α-Synuclein uptake in dopaminergic neurons, thereby preventing synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659418>Cinnamaldehyde inhibits Candida albicans growth by causing apoptosis and its treatment on vulvovaginal candidiasis and oropharyngeal candidiasis.</a></h2><p>The invasion of Candida albicans is one of the most common fungal infections seen in clinical practice, and serious drug resistance has been reported in recent years. Therefore, new anti-C. albicans drugs must be introduced. In this research, it was demonstrated that cinnamaldehyde (CA) shows strong antimicrobial activity, with 0.26 mg/mL CA being the minimum inhibitory concentration to manage C. albicans. Extraordinarily, we detected that CA accumulated the intracellular reactive  species (ROS) and enhanced the calcium concentration in the cytoplasm and mitochondria through flow cytometry. In addition, we observed that C. albicans cells released Cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential, and activated the metacaspase when exposed to 0.065, 0.13, 0.26, and 0.52 mg/mL CA. Furthermore, to confirm that CA introduces the C. albicans apoptosis, we discovered that when the phosphatidylserine was exposed, DNA damage and chromatin condensation occurred, which were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. Finally, demonstrations of phenotype investigation, colony-forming unit (CFU) counts, and periodic -Schiff (PAS) staining were conducted to prove that CA possessed the ability to treat oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). From the above, our research indicates that CA is a promising antifungal candidate when applied to C. albicans infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652571>GLYI4 Plays A Role in Methylglyoxal Detoxification and Jasmonate-Mediated Stress Responses in .</a></h2><p>Plant hormones play a central role in various physiological functions and in mediating defense responses against (a)biotic stresses. In response to primary metabolism alteration, plants can produce also small molecules such as methylglyoxal (MG), a cytotoxic aldehyde. MG is mostly detoxified by the combined actions of the enzymes glyoxalase I (GLYI) and glyoxalase II (GLYII) that make up the glyoxalase system. Recently, by a genome-wide association study performed in Arabidopsis, we identified GLYI4 as a novel player in the crosstalk between jasmonate (JA) and salicylic  (SA) hormone pathways. Here, we investigated the impact of  knock-down on MG scavenging and on JA pathway. In  mutant plants, we observed a general stress phenotype, characterized by compromised MG scavenging, accumulation of reactive  species (ROS), stomatal closure, and reduced fitness. Accumulation of MG in  plants led to lower efficiency of the JA pathway, as highlighted by the increased susceptibility of the plants to the pathogenic fungus . Moreover, MG accumulation brought about a localization of GLYI4 to the plasma membrane, while MeJA stimulus induced a translocation of the protein into the cytoplasmic compartment. Collectively, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that GLYI4 is a hub in the MG and JA pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652773>Modern Extraction and Purification Techniques for Obtaining High Purity Food-Grade Bioactive Compounds and Value-Added Co-Products from Citrus Wastes.</a></h2><p>Citrus contains a range of highly beneficial bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, carotenoids, and vitamins that show antimicrobial and antioxidant properties and help in building the body's immune system. On consumption or processing, approximately 50% of the fruit remains as inedible waste, which includes peels, seeds, pulp, and segment residues. This waste still consists of substantial quantities of bioactive compounds that cause environmental pollution and are harmful to the ecosystem because of their high biological  demand. In recent years, citrus cultivation and the production of processed foods have become a major agricultural industry. In addition to being a substantial source of economy, it is an ideal and sustainable and renewable resource for obtaining bioactive compounds and co-products for food and pharmaceutical industries. In the present article, the various methods of extraction, conventional and modern, as well as separation and isolation of individual bioactive compounds from the extraction mixture and their determination have been reviewed. This article presents both aspects of extraction methods, i.e., on a small laboratory scale and on an industrial mass scale. These methods and techniques have been extensively and critically reviewed with anticipated future perspectives towards the maximum utilization of the citrus waste.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675441>A matter of life and death: molecular, physiological and environmental regulation of seed longevity.</a></h2><p>Both seed germination and early seedling establishment are important biological processes in a plant's lifecycle. Seed longevity is a key trait in agriculture, which directly influences seed germination and ultimately determines crop productivity and hence food security. Numerous studies have demonstrated that seed deterioration is regulated by complex interactions between diverse endogenous genetically controlled factors and exogenous environmental cues, including temperature, relative humidity, and  partial pressure during seed storage. The endogenous factors, including the chlorophyll concentration, the structure of the seed coat, the balance of phytohormones, the concentration of reactive  species, the integrity of nucleic  and proteins and their associated repair systems, are also involved in the control of seed longevity. A precise understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying seed longevity is becoming a hot topic in plant molecular biology. In this review, we describe recent research into the regulation of seed longevity and the interactions between the various environmental and genetic factors. Based on this, the current state-of-play regarding seed longevity regulatory networks will be presented, particularly with respect to agricultural seed storage, and the research challenges to be faced in the future will be discussed.This article is protected by copyright.

Although many studies have indicated that SMF have positive effects on bone tissue, there were limited studies investigate the effects of HiSMF on bone cells, including osteoclasts. To illustrate the effect of HiSMF on osteoclast differentiation, and whether iron involve in the altered osteoclast formation and resorption ability under HiSMF. 16 T HiSMF generated from a superconducting magnet was used. Osteoclastogenesis, bone resorption, acting ring formation, mRNA expression, and protein expression were determined by tartrate-resistant  phosphatase (TRAP) staining, pits formation assay, rhodamine-conjugated phalloidine staining, qRT-PCR, and western blot, respectively. The changes induced by HiSMF in the level of iron, and the concentration of mitochondrial protein, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), reactive  species (ROS), malonaldehyde (MDA), and glutathione (GSH) was examined by atomic absorption spectrometry, and corresponding commercial kits, respectively. The results showed HiSMF significantly inhibited osteoclastic formation and resorption ability, and reduced cellular iron content during osteoclast differentiation. Mitochondrial concentration and oxidative stress levels in osteoclasts was decreased under HiSMF. Mechanistically, HiSMF markedly blocked the expression of osteoclast-associated transcription factors and osteoclast marker genes, and inhibited iron absorption and iron storage-related protein expression. These findings demonstrated that the effect of HiSMF on iron metabolism of osteoclasts was involved in the inhibition of HiSMF on osteoclast differentiation.This article is protected by copyright.

The degradation of AO 7 followed pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics. The removals of AO 7, chemical  demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) were 87.15%, 49.88% and 44.94% after 60 min of electrolysis at the optimal conditions (NaSO concentration 0.1 M, initial pH 5, initial AO 7 concentration 100 mg L and applied current density 20 mA cm), respectively. And the corresponding degradation rate constant was 0.035 min. The intermediates formed during electrochemical process were identified, and a possible degradation pathway was proposed, which was initiated by the oxidation of azo bond (-NN-), hydroxylation and substitution reaction of -NH and -SOH under the attack of OH, and ended with the formation of mineralization products such as NH, NO, SO, CO and HO. The toxicity of treated AO 7 solution towards Vibrio fischeri increased slightly at first and then rapidly reduced to non-toxicity with prolonging time. The results indicate that electrochemical oxidation of AO 7 using Fe-doped PbO electrode is a promising way.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Glutamine is the most bountiful and flexible amino  in the body which provides adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) demands for cells. Emerging evidences support that glutamine which acts as the second metabolic regulator after glucose exerts crucial roles in bone homeostasis at cellular level, including the lineage allocation and proliferation of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), the matrix mineralization of osteoblasts, and the biosynthesis in chondrocytes. The integrated mechanism consisting of WNT, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and reactive  species (ROS) signaling pathway in a glutamine-dependent pattern is responsible to regulate the complex intrinsic biological process, despite more extensive molecules are deserved to be elucidated in glutamine metabolism further. Indeed, dysfunctional glutamine metabolism enhances the development of degenerative bone diseases, such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, and glutamine or glutamine progenitor supplementation can partially restore bone defects which may promote treatment of bone diseases, although the mechanisms are not quite clear. In this review, we will summarize and update the latest research findings and clinical trials on the crucial regulatory roles of glutamine metabolism in BMSCs and BMSC-derived bone cells, also followed with the osteoclasts which are important in bone resorption.Copyright © 2019 Tao Zhou et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644267>Optimization of Antibacterial Efficacy of Noble-Metal-Based Core-Shell Nanostructures and Effect of Natural Organic Matter.</a></h2><p>Noble-metal-based nanomaterials made of less toxic metals have been utilized as potential antibacterial agents due to their distinctive oxidase-like activity. In this study, we fabricated core-shell structured Pd@Ir bimetallic nanomaterials with an ultrathin shell. Pd@Ir nanostructures show morphology-dependent bactericidal activity, in which Pd@Ir octahedra possessing higher oxidase-like activity exert bactericidal activity stronger than that of Pd@Ir cubes. Furthermore, our results reveal that the presence of natural organic matter influences the antibacterial behaviors of nanomaterials. Upon interaction with humic  (HA), the Pd@Ir nanostructures induce an elevated level of reactive  species, resulting in significantly enhanced bactericidal activity of the nanostructures. Mechanism analysis shows that the presence of HA efficiently enhances the oxidase-like activity of nanomaterials and promotes the cellular internalization of nanomaterials. We believe that the present study will not only demonstrate an effective strategy for improving the bactericidal activity of noble-metal-based nanomaterials but also provide an understanding of the antibacterial behavior of nanomaterials in the natural environment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672919>Detection, identification and quantification of oxidative protein modifications.</a></h2><p>Exposure of biological molecules to oxidants is inevitable and therefore commonplace. Oxidative stress in cells arises from both external agents and endogenous processes that generate reactive species, either purposely (e.g. during pathogen killing or enzymatic reactions) or accidently (e.g. exposure to radiation, pollutants, drugs, or chemicals). As proteins are highly abundant and react rapidly with many oxidants, they are highly susceptible to, and major targets of, oxidative damage. This can result in changes to protein structure, function, and turnover and to loss or (occasional) gain of activity. Accumulation of oxidatively modified proteins, due to either increased generation or decreased removal, has been associated with both aging and multiple diseases. Different oxidants generate a broad, and sometimes characteristic, spectrum of post-translational modifications. The kinetics (rates) of damage formation also vary dramatically. There is a pressing need for reliable and robust methods that can detect, identify, and quantify the products formed on amino , peptides, and proteins, especially in complex systems. This review summarizes several advances in our understanding of this complex chemistry and highlights methods that are available to detect oxidative modifications-at the amino , peptide, or protein level-and their nature, quantity, and position within a peptide sequence. Although considerable progress has been made in the development and application of new techniques, it is clear that further development is required to fully assess the relative importance of protein oxidation and to determine whether an oxidation is a cause, or merely a consequence, of injurious processes.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659544>Phytotoxic and genotoxic effect of Aluminum to date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) in vitro cultures.</a></h2><p>Al is a common metallic element found in earth's crust and is a toxic pollutant present at high concentrations in acidic soil, thus affecting plant growth. Despite being well studied as a toxic element, the effects of Al on date palm have not been investigated. This study aimed to assess the toxic effects of different Al concentrations on the development and growth of date palm callus and evaluate the biochemical and molecular response of date palm cells under Al stress.Our study revealed the phytotoxicity of Al concentrations (50, 100, 150 and 200 mg.l) on date palm callus. The fresh and dry weight and the number of produced embryos were significantly decreased in response to Al concentration. At 150 mg.l, the embryo number decreased to 1.66 compared with the 19.33 in the control treatment. At high Al concentration (200 mg.l), the callus failed to produce any embryo. Biochemical analysis revealed that Al exposure had negative effect on callus. Total soluble carbohydrates, total soluble protein and free amino  were decreased in plants receiving 200 mg.l Al treatment compared with those in the untreated ones. A similar decline was observed in total soluble protein and free amino  in response to Al treatment. Significant accumulations of malondialdehyde, HO and peroxidase activity accompanied the increase in Al concentration in cultured tissues, revealing the generation of toxic reactive  species in affected cultures. The genotoxic effect of Al at high concentrations (150 and 200 mg.l) was revealed by protein patterns.Our findings revealed for the first time the phytotoxicity of Al to date palm callus. At 200 mg.l, Al prevented the embryo production of date palm callus. At 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg.l, Al negatively affected the biochemical characteristics of date palm callus. At 150 and 200 mg.l, Al induced changes in protein expression. These data showed that the tissue culture technique can be used as a valuable approach in heavy metal toxicity studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627065>Enhancement of pyruvic  production in Candida glabrata by engineering hypoxia-inducible factor 1.</a></h2><p>Dissolved  (DO) supply plays essential roles in microbial organic  production. Candida glabrata, as a dominant strain for producing pyruvic , principally converts glucose to pyruvic  through glycolysis. However, this process relies excessively on high extracellular DO content. In this study, in combination with specific motif analysis of gene promoters, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) was engineered to improve the transcription level of some enzymes related to pyruvic  synthesis under low DO level and directly led to increased pyruvic  production and glycolysis efficiency. Moreover, the intracellular stability of HIF1 was further optimized from different aspects to maximize pyruvic  accumulation. Finally, the pyruvic  titer in a 5-L batch bioreactor with 10% DO level reached 53.1 g/L. As pyruvic  is involved in the biosynthesis of various products, these findings suggest that HIF1-enabled regulation method has significant potential for increasing the synthesis of other chemicals in microorganisms.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The occurrence and environmental control factors of lipophilic marine algal toxins (LMATs) in the surface seawater of the Changjiang estuary (CJE) and the adjacent East China Sea (ECS) were investigated. Pectenotoxin-2 (PTX2), okadaic  (OA), dinophysistoxin-1(DTX1), and gymnodimine (GYM) were detected in the CJE surface seawater in summer, with concentration ranges of not detected (ND)-105.54 ng/L, ND-13.24 ng/L, ND-5.48 ng/L, and ND-12.95 ng/L, respectively. DTX1 (ND-316.15 ng/L), OA (ND-16.13 ng/L), and PTX2 (ND-4.97 ng/L) were detected in the ECS during spring. LMATs formed a unique low-concentration band in the Changjiang diluted water (CJDW) coverage area in the typical large river estuary. PTX2, OA, and DTX1 in seawater were mainly derived from  and , while GYM was suspected to be from . Correlation analyses showed that LMAT levels in seawater were positively correlated with dissolved  and salinity, but negatively correlated with temperature and nutrients, indicating that the hydrological condition and nutritional status of seawater and climatic factors exert significant effects on the distribution of LMATs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625253>A novel long-range n to π* interaction secures the smallest known α-helix in water.</a></h2><p>An amide bond linking side chains of the first and fifth amino  forms a cyclic pentapeptide that optimally stabilizes the smallest known alpha helix in water. The origin of stabilization is unclear. Dependence of alpha helicity on solvent and cyclization linker led us to discover a novel long-range n to p* interaction between a mainchain amide  and a uniquely positioned carbonyl group in the linker of cyclic pentapeptides. CD and NMR spectra, NMR and X-ray structures, modelling and MD simulations reveal this first example of a synthetically incorporated long-range n to p* CO…C=O interaction that uniquely enforces an almost perfect and remarkably stable peptide alpha helix in water, but not in DMSO.

In this study, mature human sperm were in vitro exposed to different concentrations of PFOA (0.25, 2.5 or 25 μg/ml) alone or in combination with progesterone (P4) to evaluate the toxicity and the potential mechanism of action. Exposure to high-dose PFOA (25 μg/ml) alone for 4 h caused a decline in capacity of human spermatozoa to penetrate synthetic mucus, with an increased production of reactive  species (ROS). Furthermore, PFOA treatment (2.5 and 25 μg/ml) evoked a transient rise in intracellular calcium concentration [Ca] by activating the sperm-specific CatSper channel. However, preincubation with PFOA (2.5-25 μg/ml) for 4 h significantly suppressed P4-stimulated extracellular Ca influx in human spermatozoa. Moreover, PFOA pretreatment at all concentrations evaluated markedly compromised P4-induced acrosome reaction and sperm penetration into viscous medium. Taken together, these results suggest that PFOA exposure may impair human sperm function through inducing oxidative stress and disturbing P4-induced Ca signaling.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

RS often have elevated levels in cancer cells and tumor microenvironments. They also have a dual effect on cancer: on the one hand, they promote pro-tumorigenic signaling to facilitate tumor survival and on the other hand, they promote antitumorigenic pathways to induce cell death. Excessive RS would disrupt the cellular redox homeostasis balance and show partiality as oxidants, which would cause irreversible damage to the adjacent biomolecules such as lipids, proteins and nucleic . The altered redox environment and the corresponding increased antioxidant capacity in cancer cells render the cells susceptible to RS-manipulated therapies, especially the augmentation of RS. With the rapid development of nanotechnology and nanomedicine, a large number of cancer therapeutic nanoplatforms have been developed to trigger RS overproduction by exogenous and/or endogenous stimulation. In this review, we highlighted the latest progress in the nanoplatforms designed for the augmentation of RS in cancer therapy. Nanoplatforms based on strategies including disabling the antioxidant defense system, photodynamic therapy (PDT), sonodynamic therapy (SDT), and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) were introduced. The crucial obstacles involved in these strategies, such as the light penetration limitation of PDT, relatively low RS release by SDT, and strict conditions of Fenton reaction-mediated CDT, were also discussed, and feasible solutions for improvement were proposed. Furthermore, synergistic therapies among individual therapeutic modalities such as chemotherapy, photothermal therapy, and RS-based dynamic therapies were overviewed, which contributed to achieving more optimal anticancer efficacy than linear addition. This review sheds light on the development of non-invasive cancer therapy based on RS manipulation and provides guidance for establishing promising cancer therapeutic platforms in clinical settings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629858>Acrolein is involved in ischemic stroke-induced neurotoxicity through spermidine/spermine-N1-acetyltransferase activation.</a></h2><p>Ischemic stroke is the most common type of cerebrovascular event and is responsible for approximately 85% of all strokes in Taiwan. Neurons contain high concentrations of polyamines, which are prone to various pathological states in the brain and are perturbed after cerebral ischemia. Acrolein, an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, has been suggested as the primary culprit of neuronal damage in stroke patients. However, the mechanism by which acrolein induces neuronal damage during ischemic stroke is not clear.Urinary 3-hydroxypropyl mercapturic  (3-HPMA), an acrolein-glutathione (GSH) metabolite, plasma acrolein-protein conjugates (Acr-PC) and plasma GSH levels were analyzed to correlate disease severity and prognosis of stroke patients compared with control subjects. In vivo middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) animal models and an in vitro  glucose deprivation (OGD) stroke model were used to investigate the mechanisms of acrolein-induced neuronal damage.A deregulated acrolein metabolism, including significantly increased plasma Acr-PC levels, decreased urinary 3-HPMA levels and decreased plasma GSH levels, was found in stroke patients compared to control subjects. We further observed that acrolein was produced during ischemia resulting in brain damage in in vivo MCAO animal model. The induction of acrolein in neuronal cells during OGD occurred due to the increased expression of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) by NF-kB pathway activation. In addition, acrolein elicited a vicious cycling of oxidative stress resulting in neurotoxicity. Finally, N-acetylcysteine effectively prevented OGD-induced neurotoxicity by scavenging acrolein.Overall, our current results demonstrate that acrolein is a culprit of neuronal damage through GSH depletion in stroke patients. The mechanism underlying the role of acrolein in stroke-related neuronal damage occurs through SSAT-induced polyamine oxidation by NF-kB pathway activation. These results provide a novel mechanism of neurotoxicity in stroke patients, aid in the development of neutralizing or preventive measures, and further our understanding of neural protection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To assess ROS metabolism, we measured the ratio of glutathione and glutathione disulfide as an indicator of tissue redox environment, MitoP/MitoB ratio to assess  mitochondrial ROS generation, thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) for lipid peroxidation, and total oxidative scavenging capacity (TOSC) in the liver, brain, and gill. In the brain, the more hypoxia tolerant  showed large increases in TBARS levels following hypoxia and hyperoxia exposure that were generally not associated with large changes in mitochondrial HO In contrast, the less-tolerant  showed no significant changes in TBARS or mitochondrial HO in the brain. More moderate responses were observed in the liver and gill of  exposed to hypoxia and hyperoxia with normoxic recovery, whereas  showed more responses to O variability in these tissues.

In order to determine the effect of the stability of a lanthanide complex on its affinity for anions, five different complexes featuring different bidentate chelating moieties were synthesized, and their affinity for anions in water at neutral pH were evaluated by longitudinal relaxometry measurements. The chelates comprise both  and nitrogen donors including maltol, 1,2-hydroxypyridinone, hydroxamic , pyridin-2-ylmethanol, and carbamoylmethylphosphonate diester. They were chosen to span a range of basicities all the while maintaining a similar tripodal tris-bidentate architecture, thereby allowing for a direct study of the role of the coordinating motif on the supramolecular recognition of anions by the corresponding Gd complex. Overall, for ligands containing the same number of protonation steps, and therefore the same charge at neutral pH, the lower the acidity of the chelate (higher ∑p's), the less stable the corresponding Gd complex, and the higher its affinity for anions. Regardless of the number of protonation steps, the more stable Gd complexes form ternary or quaternary assemblies with coordinating anions. In contrast, the same anions readily displace the chelate of the least stable complexes, resulting instead in the formation of Gd·anion precipitates. Irrespective of the chelate, in the absence of steric hindrance at the open coordination site, the affinity of Gd complexes for anions follows the order phosphate > arsenate > bicarbonate > fluoride. Hence, the selectivity and affinity of Gd complexes of tripodal tris-bidentate chelates for anions is a function of the stability of the Gd complex and the basicity of the anion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647212>Conformal Solution Deposition of Pt-Pd Titania Nanocomposite Coatings for Light-Assisted Formic  Electrooxidation.</a></h2><p>Many nanofabrication processes require sophisticated equipment, elevated temperature, vacuum or specific atmospheric conditions, templates, and exotic chemicals, which severely hampers their implementation in real-world applications. In this study, we outline a fully wet-chemical procedure for equipping a 3D carbon felt (CF) substrate with a multifunctional, titania nanospike supported Pt-Pd nanoparticle (Pt-Pd-TiO2@CF) layer in a facile and scalable manner. The nanostructure, composition, chemical speciation and formation of the material was meticulously investigated, evidencing the conformal coating of the substrate with a roughened layer of nanocrystalline rutile spikes by chemical bath deposition from Ti3+ solutions. The spikes are densely covered by bimetallic nanoparticles of 4.4 ± 1.1 nm size, which were produced by autocatalytic Pt deposition onto Pd seeds introduced by Sn2+ ionic layer adsorption and reaction. The as-synthesized nanocomposite was applied to the (photo)electrooxidation of formic  (FA), exhibiting a superior performance compared to Pt-plated, Pd-seeded CF (Pt-Pd@CF) and commercial Pt-C, indicating the promoting electrocatalytic role of the TiO2 support. Upon UV-Vis illumination, the performance of the Pt-Pd-TiO2@CF electrode is remarkably increased (22-fold), generating a current density of 110 mA cm-2, distinctly outperforming titania-free Pt-Pd@CF (5 mA cm-2) and commercial Pt-C (6 mA cm-2) reference catalysts. In addition, the Pt-Pd-TiO2@CF showed a much better stability, characterized by a very high poisoning tolerance for in-situ generated CO intermediates, whose formation is hindered in the presence of TiO2. This overall performance boost is attributed to a dual enhancement mechanism (~30% electrocatalytic, ~70% photoelectrocatalytic). The photo-generated electrons from the TiO2 conduction band enrich the electron density of the Pt nanoparticles, promoting the generation of active  species on their surfaces from adsorbed  and water molecules, which facilitate the direct FA electrooxidation into CO2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606716>Tartary buckwheat transcription factor FtbZIP83 improves the drought/salt tolerance of Arabidopsis via an ABA-mediated pathway.</a></h2><p>Plants are subjected to a variety of abiotic stresses during their lifetime, and drought and salt stress are some of the main causes of reduced crop yields. Previous studies have shown that AREB/ABFs within bZIP transcription factors are involved in plant drought and salt stress responses in an ABA-dependent manner. However, the properties and functions of AREB/ABFs in Fagopyrum tataricum, a cereal with good resistance to abiotic stresses, are poorly understood. In this study, a gene encoding an AREB/ABF, designated FtbZIP83, was first isolated from Tartary buckwheat. Expression analysis in Tartary buckwheat indicated that FtbZIP83 was significantly induced by abscisic  (ABA), NaCl and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The overexpression of FtbZIP83 in Arabidopsis resulted in increased drought/salt tolerance, which was attributed not only to higher proline (Pro) contents and antioxidant enzyme activity in transgenic lines compared with controls but also to the lower reactive  species (ROS) accumulation and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. In addition, we found that FtbZIP83 was able to respond to drought and salt stress by upregulating the transcript abundance of downstream ABA-inducible gene. Furthermore, promoter sequence analysis showed that ABREs were present, and the activity of the FtbZIP83 promoter in transgenic Arabidopsis after drought stress was significantly higher than that under normal conditions. Based on the potential signalling pathways involved in AREB/ABFs, we also screened for the interaction protein FtSnRK2.6/2.3, which may phosphorylate FtbZIP83. Collectively, these results provide evidence that FtbZIP83, as a positive regulator, responds to drought/salt stress via an ABA-dependent signalling pathway composed of SnRK2-AREB/ABF.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Due to the high graphitic degree and built-in few-layer nanotubes, the as-synthesized carbonaceous materials possess a higher catalytic ozonation activity than that of the state-of-the-art carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and LaMnO perovskite catalysts for the destruction of different aqueous contaminants.

The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and selective radical quenching tests revealed that the destruction of the aqueous organics predominantly relied on surface-adsorbed complexes (O* and O*) from activated ozone molecules. Owing to the occurrence of this surface oxidation pathway, the compatibility of the CPGs/O system was significantly enhanced for treatment of real wastewater, where the inorganic anions and organic natural organic matter would inhibit radical oxidation as radical scavengers.

Inflammatory is considered driving the progression of AKI. Salvianolic  A (SA), one of the major ingredients of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, displays plenty of biological effects. Herein, the effect of SA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced AKI in mice and further related mechanism in inflammatory cells were explored. In vivo experiments demonstrated that SA significantly ameliorated LPS-challenged AKI by preventing glomerulus atrophy and decreasing plasma creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. Meanwhile, SA significantly decreased the release of serum inflammatory cytokines and blocked macrophage infiltration in damaged renal tissue. In in vitro studies, SA significantly decreased TNF-α and IL-6 release levels and altered the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in LPS-stimulated macrophages, which were consistent with the results from in vivo experiments. Furthermore, SA that bound to Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) was able to reduce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and reactive  species (ROS) generation in response to LPS stimulation.

The animals were exposed to Cd (5 mg/kg) and Ni (150 μg/L in drinking water) singly or co-exposed to both metals and ω-3FA at 20 mg/kg for 14 consecutive days. Results showed that hepatorenal injury resulting from individual exposure to Cd or Ni was not aggravated in the co-exposure group. Moreover, ω-3FA markedly abrogated the reduction in the antioxidant enzyme activities, the increase in reactive  and nitrogen species, and lipid peroxidation induced by Cd and Ni co-exposure. Additionally, ω-3FA administration markedly suppressed the increase in hepatic and renal myeloperoxidase activity, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-1 β levels in the co-exposure group. Genotoxicity resulting from individual exposure to Cd or Ni was intensified in the co-exposure group. However, ω-3FA administration markedly ameliorated the genotoxicity and histological lesions in the co-exposure group. Taken together, co-exposure to Cd and Ni aggravated genotoxicity and not oxido-inflammatory stress in the liver and kidney of rats. ω-3FA abated hepatorenal injury and genotoxicity induced by Cd and Ni co-exposure in rats.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636364>Distinct nitrogen cycling and steep chemical gradients in Trichodesmium colonies.</a></h2><p>Trichodesmium is an important dinitrogen (N)-fixing cyanobacterium in marine ecosystems. Recent nucleic  analyses indicate that Trichodesmium colonies with their diverse epibionts support various nitrogen (N) transformations beyond N fixation. However, rates of these transformations and concentration gradients of N compounds in Trichodesmium colonies remain largely unresolved. We combined isotope-tracer incubations, micro-profiling and numeric modelling to explore carbon fixation, N cycling processes as well as , ammonium and nitrate concentration gradients in individual field-sampled Trichodesmium colonies. Colonies were net-autotrophic, with carbon and N fixation occurring mostly during the day. Ten percent of the fixed N was released as ammonium after 12-h incubations. Nitrification was not detectable but nitrate consumption was high when nitrate was added. The consumed nitrate was partly reduced to ammonium, while denitrification was insignificant. Thus, the potential N transformation network was characterised by fixed N gain and recycling processes rather than denitrification.  concentrations within colonies were ~60-200% air-saturation. Moreover, our modelling predicted steep concentration gradients, with up to 6-fold higher ammonium concentrations, and nitrate depletion in the colony centre compared to the ambient seawater. These gradients created a chemically heterogeneous microenvironment, presumably facilitating diverse microbial metabolisms in millimetre-sized Trichodesmium colonies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645375>Cardiac mitochondrial function, nitric oxide sensitivity and lipid composition following hypoxia acclimation in sablefish.</a></h2><p>In fishes, the effect of O limitation on cardiac mitochondrial function remains largely unexplored. The sablefish ) encounters considerable variations in environmental  availability, and is an interesting model for studying the effects of hypoxia on fish cardiorespiratory function. We investigated how  hypoxic acclimation (6 months at 40%+3 weeks at 20% air saturation) and  anoxia-reoxygenation affected sablefish cardiac mitochondrial respiration and reactive  species (ROS) release rates using high-resolution fluorespirometry. Further, we investigated how hypoxic acclimation affected the sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration to nitric oxide (NO), and compared mitochondrial lipid and fatty  (FA) composition between groups. Hypoxic acclimation did not alter mitochondrial coupled or uncoupled respiration, or respiratory control ratio, ROS release rates, P or superoxide dismutase activity. However, it increased citrate synthase activity (by∼20%), increased the sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration to NO inhibition [i.e., the NO IC was 25% lower], and enhanced the recovery of respiration (by 21%) and reduced ROS release rates (by 25-30%) post-anoxia. Further, hypoxic acclimation altered the mitochondria's FA composition [increasing arachidonic  (20:4ω6) and eicosapentaenoic  (20:5ω3) proportions by 11 and 14%, respectively], and SIMPER analysis revealed that the phospholipid: sterol ratio was the largest contributor (24%) to the dissimilarity between treatments. Overall, these results suggest that hypoxic acclimation may protect sablefish cardiac bioenergetic function during or after periods of O limitation, and that this may be related to alterations in the mitochondria's sensitivity to NO and to adaptive changes in membrane composition (fluidity).© 2019.

Aβ42O also regulate the proliferative and differentiative properties of stem cells.We aimed to study whether Aβ42O-induced mtDNA damage is involved in the regulation of stem cell differentiation.Human iPSCs-derived neural stem cell (NSC) was applied to investigate the effect of Aβ42O on reactive  species (ROS) production and DNA damage using mitoSOX staining and long-range PCR lesion assay, respectively. mtDNA repair activity was measured by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in vitro assay using mitochondria isolates and the expression and localization of NHEJ components were determined by Western blot and immunofluorescence assay. The expressions of Tuj-1 and GFAP, detected by immunofluorescence and qPCR, respectively, were examined as an index of neurons and astrocytes production.We show that in NSC Aβ42O treatment induces ROS production and mtDNA damage and impairs DNA end joining activity. NHEJ components, such as Ku70/80, DNA- PKcs, and XRCC4, are localized in mitochondria and silencing of XRCC4 significantly exacerbates the effect of Aβ42O on mtDNA integrity. On the contrary, pre-treatment with Phytic  (IP6), which specifically stimulates DNA-PK-dependent end-joining, inhibits Aβ42O-induced mtDNA damage and neuronal differentiation alteration.Aβ42O-induced mtDNA repair impairment may change cell fate thus shifting human NSC differentiation toward an astrocytic lineage.

HA is widely used in agriculture but is known to have therapeutic properties, which are still poorly explored. Previous studies have shown the potential of biotechnological processes in the production of HA in submerged fermentation (SF) and solid-state fermentation (SSF) using pre-treated fibers of oil palm of empty fruit bunch (EFB) for the cultivation of  strains. EFB is an agro-industrial residue that is readily available at a low cost. The present study aimed to study the production of HA by  in the SSF of raw fibers of EFBs from two different palm oil producers. Profiles of HA production, cellular protein, pH, glucose, moisture, and  transfer were obtained during SSF by EFB with and without lipids, as well as, images by electron microscopy of fibers. Results showed efficient HA production in the raw fibers of the EFBs. HA production followed the cellular protein (6 g HA per 100 g of fibers) evolution of the fermentations in the absence of lipids, while the composition of lipids greatly affected its production. The best HA production (350 mg HA per 100 g of fibers) was obtained from EFB that was richer in lignocellulosics and the residual lipids were similar to the fractions of palm and kernel oils, while EFB with lower lignocellulosic presented a production 110 mg HA per 100 g of fibers.© King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617036>Evaluating aeration and stirring effects to improve itaconic  production from glucose using Aspergillus terreus.</a></h2><p>The effects of the bioreactor conditions, in particular the mode and intensity of aeration and mixing were studied on itaconic  (IA) fermentation efficiency by Aspergillus terreus strain from glucose substrate.

Ginsenoside Rg1 (GRg1), the major active ginsenoside enriched in tonic food ginseng, was reported to help alleviate liver diseases. In the present study, GRg1 was evaluated for its impact on palmitic  (PA)-induced hepatic insulin resistance model in vitro.Insulin resistance in HepG2 cells was induced by 0.5 mM PA exposure for 24 h and then the effect of GRg1 on cellular glucose consumption was measured. Expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphate (G6Pase) were analyzed by Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Activation of protein kinases and transcript factor was analyzed by measuring protein phosphorylation. The influence of GRg1 on reactive  species (ROS) production in HepG2 was also examined.GRg1 reversed PA-induced decrease in glucose consumption of HepG2 cells by downregulating gluconeogenesis genes G6pase and PEPCK. GRg1 increased Akt activation but inhibited JNK activation in PA-challenged HepG2 cells. Cellular ROS level was elevated in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells but was reduced by GRg1.Together these findings indicate that GRg1 protects against hepatic insulin resistance via preserving insulin signaling sensitivity and is a promising alternative medicine.Copyright © 2019.

Meanwhile, benzoic  functionalized graphene (BFG) was synthetized as a synergist. A "four-source flame-retardant system" (KC-IFR/BFG) was constructed with KC-IFR and BFG. KC-IFR/BFG was blended with waterborne epoxy resin (EP) to prepare flame-retardant coatings. The effects of different ratios of KC-IFR and BFG on the flame-retardant properties of EP were investigated. The results showed that the limiting  index (LOI) values increased from 19.7% for the waterborne epoxy resin to 28.7% for the EP1 with 20 wt% KC-IFR. The addition of BFG further improved the LOI values of the composites. The LOI value reached 29.8% for the EP5 sample with 18 wt% KC-IFR and 2 wt% BFG and meanwhile, UL-94 test reached the V-0 level. In addition, the peak heat release (pHRR) and smoke release rate (SPR) of EP5 decreased by 63.5% and 65.4% comparing with EP0, respectively.

Ghrelin stimulates food intake and increases gastric movement. In rat model, injected β‑hydroxybutyric  (β‑HB) leads to a decrease in body weight. It has been reported that patients with gastric erosions are slower to evacuate the stomach. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of ghrelin and β‑HB on motility and inflammation in rat gastric antral smooth muscle cells (GASMCs). GASMCs were extracted from rat gastric antrum. Cell viability was determined using the Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay. A reactive  species (ROS) assay kit was used to analyze the levels of ROS using flow cytometry. Protein levels were determined using western blotting, and the expression levels of mRNAs were evaluated using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. β‑HB inhibited the expression of myosin regulatory light polypeptide 9 (MYL9), myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), transforming protein RhoA (RhoA), Rho‑associated protein kinase‑1 (ROCK‑1) and growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS‑R). By contrast, ghrelin increased the expression of MYL9, MLCK, RhoA, ROCK‑1 and GHS‑R in β‑HB‑treated GASMCs. β‑HB increased the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α, interleukin (IL)‑6 and ROS, and decreased the levels of manganese (Mn) superoxide dismutase (SOD), copper/zinc (Cu/Zn)SOD and catalase. Ghrelin decreased the expression of TNF‑α, IL‑6, ROS and catalase, whereas ghrelin promoted the expression of MnSOD and Cu/ZnSOD in β‑HB‑treated GASMCs. Short interfering RNA targeting GHS‑R inhibited the expression of MYL9, MLCK, RhoA and ROCK‑1, and increased the levels of TNF‑α, IL‑6 and ROS in β‑HB‑treated or ghrelin‑treated GASMCs. The present study provided preliminary evidence that β‑HB inhibits the motility of GASMCs and promotes inflammation in GASMCs, whereas ghrelin decreases these effects. GHS‑R acted as a primary regulator of motility and inflammation in GASMCs treated with β‑HB and ghrelin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657228>Nitric Oxide-Dependent Protein Posttranslational Modifications Impair Mitochondrial Function and Metabolism to Contribute to Neurodegenerative Diseases.</a></h2><p>Most brains affected by neurodegenerative diseases manifest mitochondrial dysfunction as well as elevated production of reactive  and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), contributing to synapse loss and neuronal injury. Recent Advances: Excessive production of RNS triggers nitric oxide (NO)-mediated posttranslational modifications of proteins, such as S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues and nitration of tyrosine residues.

In this study, 120 sows were divided into six groups based on backfat thickness (≤16, 17-18, 19-20, 21-22, 23-24, and ≥25 mm) in late gestation. The placental lipids, reactive  species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels, inflammatory-related cytokine and angiogenesis were determined. The concentrations of triglycerides, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and free fatty  (FFA) linearly increased ( < 0.05) associated with increased late gestation backfat. ROS and MDA increased and TAC decreased ( < 0.05) as the backfat thickness increased. The mRNA expression of toll-like receptors (TLR) 2, TLR4, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 increased with increased backfat in late gestation. There were no differences in IL-8 and IL-10 mRNA expression among sows with different backfat thickness. Placental vessel density initially increased and then decreased with increasing backfat thickness of sows. Similarly, the mRNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were also increased and then decreased. Excessive backfat in late gestation was associated with greater oxidative stress, greater expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and decreased expression of placental angiogenic regulators.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664147>Leucine-rich diet induces a shift in tumour metabolism from glycolytic towards oxidative phosphorylation, reducing glucose consumption and metastasis in Walker-256 tumour-bearing rats.</a></h2><p>Leucine can stimulate protein synthesis in skeletal muscle, and recent studies have shown an increase in leucine-related mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation capacity in muscle cells. However, leucine-related effects in tumour tissues are still poorly understood. Thus, we described the effects of leucine in both in vivo and in vitro models of a Walker-256 tumour. Tumour-bearing Wistar rats were randomly distributed into a control group (W; normoprotein diet) and leucine group (LW; leucine-rich diet [normoprotein + 3% leucine]). After 20 days of tumour evolution, the animals underwent -fludeoxyglucose positron emission computed tomography (F-FDG PET-CT) imaging, and after euthanasia, fresh tumour biopsy samples were taken for  consumption rate measurements (Oroboros Oxygraph), electron microscopy analysis and RNA and protein extraction. Our main results from the LW group showed no tumour size change, lower tumour glucose (F-FDG) uptake, and reduced metastatic sites. Furthermore, leucine stimulated a shift in tumour metabolism from glycolytic towards oxidative phosphorylation, higher mRNA and protein expression of oxidative phosphorylation components, and enhanced mitochondrial density/area even though the leucine-treated tumour had a higher number of apoptotic nuclei with increased oxidative stress. In summary, a leucine-rich diet directed Walker-256 tumour metabolism to a less glycolytic phenotype profile in which these metabolic alterations were associated with a decrease in tumour aggressiveness and reduction in the number of metastatic sites in rats fed a diet supplemented with this branched-chain amino .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626374>Electrolyte effects on the electrocatalytic performance of iridium-based nanoparticles for  evolution in rotating disc electrodes.</a></h2><p>Proton exchange membrane water electrolysers are very promising renewable energy conversion devices that produce hydrogen from sustainable feedstocks. These devices are mainly limited by the sluggish kinetics of the  evolution reaction (OER). Ir-based nanoparticles are both reasonably active and stable for the OER in acidic media. The electrolyte composition and the pH may play a crucial role in electrocatalysis, yet they have been widely overlooked for the OER. Herein, we present a study on the effects of the composition and concentration of the electrolyte on commercial Ir black nanoparticles using concentrations of 0.05 M, 0.1 M and 0.5 M of both sulphuric and perchloric . The results show an important effect of the electrolyte composition on the catalytic performance of the Ir nanoparticles. The concentration of H 2 SO 4 interferes on the oxidation of Ir and decreases the catalytic performance of the catalyst. HClO 4 does not show strong interferences in the electrochemistry of Ir.

Its biological conversion into a stable form can be obtained through urea hydrolysis, subsequent nitrification, and organics removal, to recover a nitrate-enriched stream, free of  demand. In this study, the utilization of a microbial community for urine nitrification was optimized with the focus for space application. To assess the role of selected parameters that can impact ureolysis in urine, the activity of six ureolytic heterotrophs ( and ) was tested at different salinities, urea, and amino  concentrations. The interaction of the ureolytic heterotrophs with a nitrifying consortium ( ATCC 19718 and  ATCC 25931) was also tested. Lastly, microgravity was simulated in a clinostat utilizing hardware for in-flight experiments with active microbial cultures. The results indicate salt inhibition of the ureolysis at 30 mS cm, while amino  nitrogen inhibits ureolysis in a strain-dependent manner. The combination of the nitrifiers with  and  resulted in a complete halt of the urea hydrolysis process, while in the case of  incomplete nitrification was observed, and nitrite was not oxidized further to nitrate. Nitrate production was confirmed in all the other communities; however, the other heterotrophic strains most likely induced  competition in the test setup, and nitrite accumulation was observed.

However, the application of RAFT polymerization to additive-manufacturing processes has been prevented due to the slow polymerization rates of typical systems. In this work, we developed a rapid visible light mediated RAFT polymerization process and applied it to a 3D printing system. The photosensitive resins contained a metal-free dye (erythrosin B) in conjunction with a tertiary amine co-catalyst (triethanolamine) and a trithiocarbonate RAFT agent (2-(butylthiocarbonothioylthio) propanoic ) to afford polymerization without prior deoxygenation. The reaction components are non-toxic, metal free and environmentally friendly (water based photosensitive resin), which tailors these systems toward the fabrication of biomaterials. Following optimization of the resin formulation by varying the ratio of photocatalyst and tertiary amine, a variety of 3D printing conditions were investigated to prepare functional materials using green light ( λ max = 525 nm, I 0 = 0.32 mW/cm 2 ). Furthermore, the mechanical properties of these 3D printed materials were tested under different conditions. Interestingly, the concentration of trithiocarbonate impacts the mechanical properties and the performance of these materials. Remarkably, the use of a photoinduced polymerization process provided facile spatial control over the network structure by varying the light dose to each layer of the 3D printed material; using this strategy, a 4D printing process was demonstrated via 3D printing and subsequent swelling and dehydration induced actuation. Furthermore, the trithiocarbonate species incorporated in the polymer networks were able to be reactivated after the initial 3D printing process, which enabled post functionalization of the printed materials via secondary photopolymerization processes.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, it is not clear what would happen when the nitrogen hydrogen of BHA was substituted with methyl and other alkyl groups. Here we show that N-methyl benzohydroxamic  (N-MeBHA, a simple model compound for the classic iron-chelator deferoxamine, which is a typical N-alkyl trihydroxamic ) could react with 2,5-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (DCBQ) to form a relatively stable initial carbon- bonding conjugation intermediate CBQ-O-N-MeBHA. However, the major final product was identified, unexpectedly, as a carbon-nitrogen bonding conjugate CBQ(OH)-N(CH)-COAr, which is the rearranged isomer of CBQ-O-N-MeBHA. Interestingly, a new 18-line nitrogen-centered radical and a carbon-centered quinone ketoxy radical were observed by the ESR spin-trapping method, which was further confirmed by HPLC-MS and N-isotope labeling methods. We further found that both new DNA adducts and DNA strand breaks could be produced by the reactive nitrogen-centered radical. Taken together, we propose that the reaction between DCBQ and N-MeBHA was not via the Lossen rearrangement, but rather through a novel radical homolysis and recoupling pathway. Analogous results were observed for other chlorinated quinones and N-alkyl hydroxamic  including the widely-used trihydroxamate iron-chelating drug deferoxamine. This represents the first report of unexpected radical pathway for the reaction between chlorinated quinones and N-alkyl hydroxamic  under normal physiological conditions, which may have broad biological and environmental significance for future study of carcinogenic chloroquinones and hydroxamic  drugs.Copyright © 2019.

However, it is not clear whether the magnitude of the vasomotor responses depends of the vessel network exposed to IH. To test the hypothesis that the magnitude of IH-induced reduction in peripheral blood flow may differ from the hypoperfusion response observed in the cerebral vascular network under -enriched conditions, nine healthy men (25±3 years) underwent 10 min of IH during either saline or vitamin C (3g) infusion, separately. Femoral artery (FA), internal carotid artery (ICA) and vertebral artery (VA) blood flow (BF, Doppler ultrasound), as well as arterial oxidant (8-isoprostane), antioxidant (ascorbic , AA) and NO bioavailability (nitrite) markers were simultaneously measured. IH increased 8-isoprostane and reduced nitrite; these responses were followed by a reduction in both FABF and ICABF, whereas VABF did not change. Absolute and relative reductions in FABF were greater than IH-induced changes in ICA and VA perfusion. Vitamin C infusion increased the arterial AA, abolished IH-induced increase in 8-isoprostane and the reduction in nitrite levels. While ICA and VA blood flow did not change during the Vitamin C-IH trial, FA perfusion increased and reached similar levels to that observed during normoxia with saline infusion. Therefore, the magnitude of IH-induced reduction in femoral blood flow is greater than that observed in the vessel network of the brain, which might involve the determinant contribution that NO has in the regulation of peripheral vascular perfusion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628200>Targeting the kynurenine pathway for the treatment of cisplatin resistant lung cancer.</a></h2><p>Cisplatin resistance is a major barrier in the effective treatment of lung cancer. Cisplatin resistant (CR) lung cancer cells do not primarily use glucose, but rather consume amino  such as glutamine and tryptophan (TRP) for survival. CR cells activate the kynurenine (KYN) pathway (KP) to cope with excessive reactive  species (ROS) and maintain homeostasis for growth and proliferation. Consequently, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) becomes an essential enzyme for CR cells' survival since it initiates and regulates the first step in the KP. Increased IDO1 activities and ROS levels are found in CR cells vs. cisplatin sensitive lung cancer. Importantly, significantly greater KYN/TRP ratio (p=0.005) is detected in serum of patients who fail cisplatin when compared to naive treatment. Knocking down IDO1 using shRNA or IDO1 inhibitors heightens ROS levels and results in a significant growth inhibitory effect only on CR cells and not cisplatin sensitive cells. Exposing CR cells to antioxidant (TIRON) results in suppression of IDO1 activity and confers resistance to IDO1 inhibition, indicating an interrelationship between ROS and IDO1. Since KYN plays a critical role in reprogramming naïve T-cells to the immune suppressive regulatory T-cell (T-reg) phenotype, we observed higher expression of T-reg (TGFβ, FoxP3 and CD4+CD25+) in mice bearing CR tumors compared to tumors from cisplatin sensitive counterparts. Implications: Findings suggest that the enzyme inhibitory activity and anti-tumor efficacy of IDO1 inhibitors rely in part on ROS levels, arguing that IDO1 expression alone may be insufficient to determine the clinical benefits for this class of experimental cancer drugs. Importantly, IDO1 inhibitors maybe more suitable to treat lung cancer patients who failed cisplatin therapy than naïve treatment patients.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656084>Ascorbic  2-glucoside stably promotes the primitiveness of embryonic and mesenchymal stem cells through TET- and CREB1-dependent mechanisms.</a></h2><p>The naïve or primitive states of stem-cells (SCs) residing in specific niches are unstable and difficult to preserve in vitro. Vitamin-C (VitC), in addition to suppressing  radicals, exerts pleiotropic effects to preserve the core functions of SCs. However, this compound is labile and readily oxidized, resulting in cellular toxicity and preventing its reliable application in this context. We found that a VitC derivative, ascorbic  2-glucoside (AA2G), stably maintains the naïve pluripotency of murine embryonic-SCs (mESCs) and the primitiveness of human mesenchymal-SCs (hMSCs) without cellular toxicity.The beneficial effects of AA2G and related molecular mechanisms were evaluated in mESCs, induced pluripotent SCs (iPSCs), and hMSCs. AA2G was stable in aqueous solution and barely induced cellular toxicity in cultured SCs, unlike VitC. AA2G supplementation recapitulated the well-known effects of VitC, including induction of ten-eleven translocation (TET)-dependent DNA demethylation in mESCs and suppression of p53 during generation of murine iPSCs. Furthermore, supplementation of hMSCs with AA2G improved therapeutic outcomes in an asthma mouse model by promoting their self-renewal, engraftment, and anti-inflammatory properties. Particularly, activation of the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-1 (CREB1) pathway contributed to the ability of AA2G to maintain naïve pluripotency of mESCs and functionality of hMSCs. Innovation and Conclusion: Given its long-lasting effects and low cellular toxicity, AA2G supplementation is useful to support the naïve pluripotency of mESCs and the primitiveness of hMSCs, which affects their developmental potency and therapeutic efficacy.

Herein, we develop a simple yet robust -treatment strategy to judiciously create an amorphous TiO 2 buffer layer intimately situated on the anatase TiO 2 surface as electron transport layer (ETL) for efficient electron transport. The facile  treatment is capable of weakening the bonding of zigzag octahedral chains in anatase TiO 2 , thereby shortening staggered octahedron chains to form an amorphous buffer layer on the anatase TiO 2 surface. Such amorphous TiO 2 -coated ETL possesses an increased electron density due to the presence of  vacancies, leading to efficient electron transfer from perovskite to TiO 2 . Compared to pristine TiO 2 -based devices, the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with -treated TiO 2 ETL exhibit enhanced short circuit current and power conversion efficiency. These findings demonstrate an unconventional route to crafting effective ETLs by deliberately creating an intimate, tailored amorphous semiconductor buffer layer for high-performance PSCs. This study may provide insights into the importance of rational design of efficient electron transporting layers in PSCs.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In the presence of 0.4 g/g TSS APG, the concentrations of soluble chemical  demand (SCOD), soluble carbohydrate and soluble protein in dissolved organic matters (DOM) were 0.4, 2.4 and 1.3 times of that without APG addition, respectively. Excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the addition of APG led to the increase of soluble microbial materials and the decrease of fulvic -like substances in DOM, which was beneficial for the subsequent process of anaerobic digestion. Using APG promoted the releasing of enzymes trapped in saline waste sludge and improved the activity of enzymes during hydrolysis. The activities of α-glucosidase and protease increased by 8.8% and 21.3% respectively in the presence of 0.4 g/g TSS APG comparing no APG addition.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

SA treatment caused apoptosis in HCT116 and HT29 cells, but not in SW480 cells, with mitochondria playing a key role. We checked for dysfunctional mitochondria after SA treatment. Mitochondria of HT29 cells were swollen, indicating damage, whereas in HCT116 cells, several mitochondria had a diminished size. Damaged mitochondria decreased ATP production and induced reactive  species (ROS) in the cells. To understand SA-induced reduction in ATP production, we investigated the electron transfer chains (ETC) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) activity, which prevents the transfer of acetyl-CoA to the TCA (tricarboxylic ) cycle by inhibiting PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase) activity. In each cell line, the inhibitory mechanism of ATP by SA was different. The activity of complex III consisting of the mitochondrial ETCs in HT29 cells was decreased. In contrast, PDH activity in HCT116 cells was reduced. Nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT)-removing reactive  species (ROS) was upregulated in HT29 cells, but not in HCT116 cells, indicating that in HT29 cells, a defense mechanism was activated against ROS. Collectively, our study showed a differential mechanism occurs in response to SA in colon cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624823>Single mutation in a novel bacterial LOV protein yields a singlet  generator.</a></h2><p>Mr4511 from Methylobacterium radiotolerans is a 164 amino  protein built of a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) binding, blue-light responsive LOV (Light, , Voltage) core domain plus flanking regions. In contrast to the majority of LOV domains, Mr4511 lacks a tryptophan residue that was previously identified as a major quencher for the FMN triplet state in photosensitizers for singlet  (SO) engineered from these photoreceptors. Here we show that for Mr4511 it is sufficient to only mutate the reactive cysteine responsible for the photocycle (Cys71) in the native protein to generate an efficient SO photosensitizer: both C71S and C71G variants exhibit SO quantum yields of formation, ΦΔ, around 0.2 in air-saturated solutions. Under  saturated conditions, ΦΔ reaches ∼0.5 in deuterated buffer. The introduction of Trp112 in the canonical position for LOV domains dramatically lowers ΦΔ to values comparable to miniSOG, one of the early FMN binding proteins touted as a SO sensitizer. Besides its SO properties, Mr4511 is also exceedingly robust against denaturation with urea and is more photostable than free FMN.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621967>Fructose metabolism as a common evolutionary pathway of survival associated with climate change, food shortage and droughts.</a></h2><p>Mass extinctions occur frequently in natural history. While studies of animals that became extinct can be informative, it is the survivors that provide clues for mechanisms of adaptation when conditions are adverse. Here, we describe a survival pathway used by many species as a means for providing adequate fuel and water, while also providing protection from a decrease in  availability. Fructose, whether supplied in the diet (primarily fruits and honey), or endogenously (via activation of the polyol pathway), preferentially shifts the organism towards the storing of fuel (fat, glycogen) that can be used to provide energy and water at a later date. Fructose causes sodium retention and raises blood pressure and likely helped survival in the setting of dehydration or salt deprivation. By shifting energy production from the mitochondria to glycolysis, fructose reduced  demands to aid survival in situations where  availability is low. The actions of fructose are driven in part by vasopressin and the generation of uric . Twice in history, mutations occurred during periods of mass extinction that enhanced the activity of fructose to generate fat, with the first being a mutation in vitamin C metabolism during the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (65 million years ago) and the second being a mutation in uricase that occurred during the Middle Miocene disruption (12-14 million years ago). Today, the excessive intake of fructose due to the availability of refined sugar and high-fructose corn syrup is driving 'burden of life style' diseases, including obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure.© 2019 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671836>Metabolomic Dynamics Reveals Oxidative Stress in Spongy Tissue Disorder During Ripening of  L. Fruit.</a></h2><p>Spongy tissue disorder, a mesocarp specific malady, severely affects the flavor and pulp characters of Alphonso mango fruit reducing its consumer acceptability. Here, we investigated comparative metabolomic changes that occur during ripening in healthy and spongy tissue-affected fruits using high resolution mass spectrometric analysis. During the spongy tissue formation, 46 metabolites were identified to be differentially accumulated. These putative metabolites belong to various primary and secondary metabolic pathways potentially involved in maintaining the quality of the fruit. Analysis revealed metabolic variations in tricarboxylic  cycle and gamma amino butyric  shunt generating reactive  species, which causes stressed conditions inside the mesocarp. Further, reduced levels of antioxidants and enzymes dissipating reactive  species in mesocarp deteriorate the fruit physiology. This oxidative stress all along affects the level of amino , sugars and enzymes responsible for flavor generation in the fruit.

This model reproduces a similar situation to MS, as well as its relationship with intestinal microbiota starting from the changes in bacterial lipopolysaccharide levels (LPS) in the outer wall of the gram-negative bacteria. Finally, the administration of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), hydroxytirosol (HT), and oleic  (OA) exert beneficial effects. Twenty-five Dark Agouti two-month-old male rats, weighing around 190 g, were distributed into the following groups: Control, EAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis group), EAE + EVOO, EAE + HT, and EAE + OA. The glutathione redox system with the EAE was measured in heart, kidney, liver, and small and large intestines. The LPS and the correlation with oxidative stress in the small and large intestines were also investigated. The results showed that (1) the oxidative damage in the EAE model affects non-nervous organs and tissues; (2) The LPS is related to inflammatory phenomena and oxidative stress in the intestinal tissue and in other organs; (3) The administration of EVOO, HT, and OA reduces the LPS levels at the same time as minimizing the oxidative damage; (4) EVOO, HT, and OA improve the disease's clinical score; and (5) on balance, EVOO offers a better neuroprotective effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651674>Factors Associated with Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation and Re-Ventilation in Acute Cervical Spinal Cord Injury Patients.</a></h2><p>Patients who had suffered from acute blunt cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) and admitted our hospital within 24 hours after injury were included in the study.We compared the respiratory function and serum reactive oxidative stress (ROS) after acute cervical SCI, and tried to find out the valuable predictors of weaning in acute cervical SCI patients.Ventilation impairment is a major complication of acute cervical SCI. Evidence of  radical formation in secondary injury from animal SCI models demonstrates an immediate post-injury increase in ROS production after SCI. We hypothesis the serum ROS is associated with the severity of patients with acute cervical SCI.38 adult patients who had acute cervical SCI and 58 healthy volunteers were enrolled.

Porphyrins are precursors of heme, an essential component of hemoglobin. Each subunit of hemoglobin is a globular protein containing an embedded heme group that contains one iron atom, capable of binding one  molecule. The heme synthesis pathway is a multi-step process that involves a specific enzyme at every step. Porphyrias are distinct clinical syndromes, which arise due to deficiency or defect in a particular enzyme needed for a specific step of the heme synthesis pathway. Although these syndromes have conventionally been classified depending on the predominant system involved (cutaneous vs. neurohepatic), significant overlap occurs, and many porphyrias present with mixed symptoms. The clinical presentation, severity, and prognosis of individual porphyrias depend on which enzyme is deficient and the accumulation of the corresponding heme precursor or porphyrin. Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) ranks as the most common and severe form of acute porphyria. Other acute porphyrias include hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), variegate porphyria (VP), and 5-aminolevulinic  (ALA) dehydratase deficiency porphyria (Doss porphyria).[1] Similar to the majority of porphyrias, AIP shows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. The acute porphyrias like AIP characteristically demonstrate acute episodes of neurovisceral symptoms, but may not manifest fully for a long time. AIP manifests as episodes of abdominal pain, neuropathies, and constipation, but, unlike the majority of other porphyrias, patients with AIP do not develop a cutaneous rash. The primary enzymatic defect in AIP is the deficiency of porphobilinogen-deaminase, also called hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS), the third enzyme in heme synthesis. The acute attacks of AIP are a result of the uncontrolled upregulation of the ALA synthase enzyme. The diagnosis of AIP gets delayed due to nonspecific symptoms and similarities with other diseases. The only cure is orthoptic liver transplantation.[2][3]Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665666>CaWRKY27 negatively regulates salt and osmotic stress responses in pepper.</a></h2><p>WRKY transcription factors are key regulatory components of plant responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses. In pepper (Capsicum annuum), CaWRKY27 positively regulates resistance to the pathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum and negatively regulates thermotolerance. Here, we report that CaWRKY27 functions in the response to salinity and osmotic stress. CaWRKY27 transcription was induced by salinity, osmotic, and abscisic  (ABA) treatments, as determined using qPCR and GUS assays. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants heterologously expressing CaWRKY27 had an increased sensitivity to salinity and osmotic stress, with a higher inhibition of both root elongation and whole plant growth, more severe chlorosis and wilting, lower germination rates, and an enhanced germination sensitivity to ABA than the corresponding wild-type plants. Furthermore, most marker genes associated with reactive  species (ROS) detoxification and polyamine and ABA biosynthesis, as well as stress-responsive genes NtDREB3, were downregulated in plants transgenically expressing CaWRKY27 upon exposure to salinity or osmotic stress. Consistently, silencing of CaWRKY27 using virus-induced gene silencing conferred tolerance to salinity and osmotic stress in pepper plants. These findings suggest that CaWRKY27 acts as a molecular link in the antagonistic crosstalk regulating the expression of defense-related genes in the responses to both abiotic and biotic stresses by acting either as a transcriptional activator or repressor in pepper.Copyright © 2019.

However, vitamin C is not only an antioxidant, since it is also a cofactor for numerous enzymes involved in plant and human metabolism. In humans, vitamin C takes part in various physiological processes, such as iron absorption, collagen synthesis, immune stimulation, and epigenetic regulation. Due to the functional loss of the gene coding for l-gulonolactone oxidase, humans cannot synthesize vitamin C; thus, they principally utilize plant-based foods for their needs. For this reason, increasing the vitamin C content of crops could have helpful effects on human health. To achieve this objective, exhaustive knowledge of the metabolism and functions of vitamin C in plants is needed. In this review, the multiple roles of vitamin C in plant physiology as well as the regulation of its content, through biosynthetic or recycling pathways, are analyzed. Finally, attention is paid to the strategies that have been used to increase the content of vitamin C in crops, emphasizing not only the improvement of nutritional value of the crops but also the acquisition of plant stress resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645575>Acetic : a cost-effective agent for mitigation of seawater-induced salt toxicity in mung bean.</a></h2><p>The current study sought the effective mitigation measure of seawater-induced damage to mung bean plants by exploring the potential roles of acetic  (AA). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that foliar application of AA under control conditions improved mung bean growth, which was interlinked to enhanced levels of photosynthetic rate and pigments, improved water status and increased uptake of K, in comparison with water-sprayed control. Mung bean plants exposed to salinity exhibited reduced growth and biomass production, which was emphatically correlated with increased accumulations of Na, reactive  species and malondialdehyde, and impaired photosynthesis, as evidenced by PCA and heatmap clustering. AA supplementation ameliorated the toxic effects of seawater, and improved the growth performance of salinity-exposed mung bean. AA potentiated several physio-biochemical mechanisms that were connected to increased uptake of Ca and Mg, reduced accumulation of toxic Na, improved water use efficiency, enhanced accumulations of proline, total free amino  and soluble sugars, increased catalase activity, and heightened levels of phenolics and flavonoids. Collectively, our results provided new insights into AA-mediated protective mechanisms against salinity in mung bean, thereby proposing AA as a potential and cost-effective chemical for the management of salt-induced toxicity in mung bean, and perhaps in other cash crops.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634818>Pharmacological inhibition of histone deacetylase reduces NADPH oxidase expression, oxidative stress and the progression of atherosclerotic lesions in hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice; potential implications for human atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>NADPH oxidase (Nox)-derived reactive  species (ROS) are instrumental in all inflammatory phases of atherosclerosis. Dysregulated histone deacetylase (HDAC)-related epigenetic pathways have been mechanistically linked to alterations in gene expression in experimental models of cardiovascular disorders. Hitherto, the relation between HDAC and Nox in atherosclerosis is not known. We aimed at uncovering whether HDAC plays a role in mediating Nox up-regulation, oxidative stress, inflammation, and atherosclerotic lesion progression. Human non-atherosclerotic and atherosclerotic arterial samples, ApoE-/- mice, and in vitro polarized monocyte-derived M1/M2-macrophages (Mac) were examined. Male ApoE-/- mice, maintained on normal or high-fat, cholesterol-rich diet, were randomized to receive 10 mg/kg suberoylanilide hydroxamic  (SAHA), a pan-HDAC inhibitor, or its vehicle, for 4 weeks. In the human/animal studies, real-time PCR, Western blot, lipid staining, lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were employed. The protein levels of class I, class IIa, class IIb, and class IV HDAC isoenzymes were significantly elevated both in human atherosclerotic tissue samples and in atherosclerotic aorta of ApoE-/- mice. Treatment of ApoE-/- mice with SAHA reduced significantly the extent of atherosclerotic lesions, and the aortic expression of Nox subtypes, NADPH-stimulated ROS production, oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory markers. Significantly up-regulated HDAC and Nox subtypes were detected in inflammatory M1-Mac. In these cells, SAHA reduced the Nox1/2/4 transcript levels. Collectively, HDAC inhibition reduced atherosclerotic lesion progression in ApoE-/- mice, possibly by intertwined mechanisms involving negative regulation of Nox expression and inflammation. The data propose that HDAC-oriented pharmacological interventions could represent an effective therapeutic strategy in atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

HepG2 cells were treated with free fatty  (FFA) mixture (oleic : palmitic , 2:1) for 24 h to stimulate in vitro fatty liver. In addition, C57BL/6 mice were fed 60 kcal% high-fat (HF) diet for eight weeks to induce fatty liver in vivo. Intracellular reactive  species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) productions were increased by FFA and HF-diet, but supplementation with CLW significantly decreased these levels. CLW treatment ameliorated antioxidant activities that were suppressed by exposure to the FFA and HF-diet. Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and fatty  transport proteins (FATP2 and FATP5) were increased in HF-diet groups, while CLW suppressed their expression levels. Moreover, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), and fatty  synthase (FAS) expression levels were down-regulated in the CLW groups compared to HF-diet groups. On the other hand, 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1) expressions were up-regulated in the CLW groups. HF-diet fed mice showed high hepatic triglycerides (TG) content compared to the normal diet mice. However, the administration of CLW restored the hepatic TG level, indicating an inhibitory effect against lipid accumulation by CLW. These results suggest that CLW could be a potentially useful agent for the prevention of NAFLD through modulating fatty  uptake.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674636>A tannic -modified fluoride pre-treated Mg-Zn-Y-Nd alloy with antioxidant and platelet-repellent functionalities for vascular stent application.</a></h2><p>Vascular stent interventional therapy, as a regular and effective therapy, has been widely used to treat coronary artery diseases. However, adverse events occur frequently after stent intervention, especially restenosis and late stent thrombosis. The targeted implanting site will suffer from severe atherosclerosis, which is considered as a chronic inflammatory disease. Meanwhile, with the over-expanding use of endovascular mechanical intervention, vascular injury has become an increasingly common issue. Lesions and newly induced vascular injury result in inflammatory and oxidative stress; meanwhile, activated macrophages and granulocytes generate high levels of reactive  species (ROS), contributing to endothelial dysfunction and neointima hyperplasia. Therefore, attenuating oxidative stress and reducing ROS generation in the inflammatory response represent reasonable strategies to inhibit intimal hyperplasia and restenosis. Herein, we have developed a multifunctional surface for the MgZnYNd alloy with tannic  (TA) coating, and the pH dependence of the coating deposition is also demonstrated. The phenolic hydroxyl groups on the coatings endow the modified surface with excellent antioxidant functions. We found that the coating can be recycled, and the scavenging activity hardly weakened within five cycles. Also, the TA coating has a promising strong antioxidant activity as it shows a radical scavenging activity over 80% in long term. Moreover, the TA coating possesses platelet-repellent capability. No significant inflammatory response was observed for the TA modified sample in the rat subcutaneous implantation test. Combining these performances, we envision that the vascular stent modified with TA coating can have great potential in various applications by virtue of its simplicity and effectiveness.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636808>Comparison of Oxidative Stress Parameters in Heart Failure Patients Depending on Ischaemic or Nonischaemic Aetiology.</a></h2><p>Abnormalities in the oxidative and antioxidant states causing oxidative stress were both found in heart failure (HF) of various aetiologies and atherosclerosis.The goals of the study were as follows: comparison of oxidative stress parameters (OSP) in ischaemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) ( = 479) and nonischaemic cardiomyopathy (nICM) ( = 295) patients; assessment of the relationships of OSP with functional capacity (NYHA class), maximal  consumption (max.O2), left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF), and NT-proBNP concentration; and determination of the mutual relations of OSP in subgroups of patients with ICM and n-ICM.Serum concentrations of total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidant status (TOS), uric  (UA), bilirubin, albumin, protein sulfhydryl groups (PSH), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured. The oxidative stress index (OSI) and MDA/PSH ratio were calculated.Higher concentrations of TAC (1.14 vs 1.11 mmol/l;  < 0.001) and MDA (1.80 vs 1.70 mol/l;  < 0.05) and higher MDA/PSH ratios (0.435 vs 0.358;  < 0,001) were observed in ICM than in nICM patients. Simultaneously, lower values of the OSI index (4.27 vs 4.6;  < 0, 05), PSH (4.10 vs 4.75 mol/g of protein;  < 0,001), and bilirubin (12.70 vs 15.40 mol/l;  < 0,001) concentrations were indicated in ICM patients. There were no differences in TOS, UA, and albumin between the examined groups. The NYHA class and VO2max correlate with MDA, bilirubin, and albumin in both groups, while with UA only in the ICM group. Correlations between the NYHA class, VO2max, and PSH were indicated in nICM. The association of LVEF with UA, bilirubin, and albumin has been demonstrated in the ICM group. The study showed negative correlations between TAC, MDA, and PSH and positive between TAC and MDA in both groups. In ICM patients, MDA positively correlated with UA. A negative correlation between PSH and concentrations of UA and bilirubin was expressed only in the nICM group.The obtained results confirm the relationship between the severity of HF and oxidative stress. The mechanisms of oxidative stress and antioxidant defence are partially different in the ICM and the nICM patients.Copyright © 2019 Ewa Romuk et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664828>Re-determination of the Structure of a Water-Soluble Hypervalent Iodine(V) Reagent AIBX and Its Synthetic Utility in the Oxidation of Alcohols and Synthesis of Isoxazoline N-Oxides.</a></h2><p>The structure of a water-soluble hypervalent iodine(V) reagent AIBX is re-examined through its single crystal X-ray analysis and theoretical calculation including Mayer bond order and localized orbital locator (LOL), and AIBX is believed to be a pseudocyclic iodylarene because of the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the trimethylammonium cation on its phenyl ring, which would decrease the electron density of carboxylic anion and make ortho-carboxyl  anion incapable to form hypervalent bond with iodine atom.

Given its Al binding capacity, malate allows internal as well as external detoxification strategies to cope with Al stress, but little is known about the metabolic processes involved in this response. Here, we analyzed the relevance of NADP-dependent malic enzyme (NADP-ME), which catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of malate, in Al tolerance. Plants lacking NADP-ME1 (nadp-me1) display lower inhibition of root elongation after Al treatment, compared to the wild type (wt). Moreover, wt roots exposed to Al show a drastic decrease in NADP-ME1 transcript level. Although malate levels in seedlings and root exudates are similar in nadp-me1 and wt, a significant increase of intracellular malate is observed in roots of nadp-me1 after a long exposure to Al. The nadp-me1 plants also show lower H O content in the root apices treated with Al and no inhibition of root elongation when exposed to glutamate, an amino  implicated in Al signaling. Proteomic studies showed several differentially expressed proteins involved in signal transduction, primary metabolism, protection against biotic and other abiotic stimulus and redox processes in nadp-me1, which may participate directly or indirectly in Al tolerance. The results indicate that NADP-ME1 is involved in adjusting the malate levels in the root apex, and its loss results in an increased content of this organic . Furthermore, the results suggest that NADP-ME1 affects signaling processes, such as the generation of reactive  species and those that involve glutamate, which could lead to root growth inhibition.© 2019 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637230>Surface Study of FeO Nanoparticles Functionalized With Biocompatible Adsorbed Molecules.</a></h2><p>Surfaces of iron oxide of ferrimagnetic magnetite (FeO) nanoparticles (MNPs) prepared by Massart's method and their functionalized form (f-MNPs) with succinic , L-arginine, oxalic , citric , and glutamic  were studied by dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-S), UV-vis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)/differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and reflection electron energy loss spectroscopy (REELS). The XPS analysis of elements and their chemical states at the surface of MNPs and f-MNPs revealed differences in chemical bonding of atoms, content of carbon- groups, iron oxide forms, iron oxide magnetic properties, adsorbed molecules, surface coverage, and overlayer thickness, whereas the Auger parameters (derived from XPS and Auger spectra) and elastic and inelastic scattering probabilities of electrons on atoms and valence band electrons (derived from REELS spectra) indicated modification of surface charge redistribution, electronic, and optical properties. These modified properties of f-MNPs influenced their biological properties. The surfaces biocompatible for L929 cells showed various cytotoxicity for HeLa cells (10.8-5.3% of cell death), the highest for MNPs functionalized with oxalic . The samples exhibiting the largest efficiency possessed smaller surface coverage and thickness of adsorbed molecules layers, the highest content of  and carbon- functionalizing groups, the highest ratio of lattice O and OH to C sp hybridizations on MNP surface, the highest ratio of adsorbed O and OH to C sp hybridizations on adsorbed molecule layers, the closest electronic and optical properties to FeO, and the lowest degree of admolecule polymerization. This high cytotoxicity was attributed to interaction of cells with a surface, where increased content of  groups, adsorbed O, and OH may play the role of additional adsorption and catalytic sites and a large content of adsorbed molecule layers of carboxylic groups facilitating Fenton reaction kinetics leading to cell damage.Copyright © 2019 Lesiak, Rangam, Jiricek, Gordeev, Tóth, Kövér, Mohai and Borowicz.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671098>Photodynamic Therapy Combined with Antifungal Drugs against Chromoblastomycosis and the Effect of ALA-PDT on Fonsecaea In Vitro.</a></h2><p>Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic skin and subcutaneous fungal infection caused by dematiaceous fungi and is associated with low cure and high relapse rates.

The isolates were assayed for susceptibility to antifungal drugs and ALA-PDT in vitro, revealing sensitivity to terbinafine, itraconazole and voriconazole, with ALA-PDT altering the cell wall and increasing reactive  species production.These results provide the basis for the development of a new therapeutic approach, and ALA-PDT combined with oral antifungal drugs constitutes a promising alternative method for the treatment of refractory and complex cases of chromoblastomycosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642452>Tetrahedral framework nucleic  prevent retina ischemia-reperfusion injury from oxidative stress via activating the Akt/Nrf2 pathway.</a></h2><p>Retinal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injuries are involved in the universal pathological processes of many ophthalmic diseases, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal arterial occlusion. The reason is that the ischemia-reperfusion injury is accompanied by the abnormal accumulation of reactive  species (ROS), which can cause damage to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), promote their apoptosis, and finally lead to the irreversible loss of the visual field. RGCs are specialized projection neurons that are situated in the inner retinal surface of the eye, and they transmit visual images into certain areas of the brain in the form of action potentials. Therefore, any damage that affects the viability of RGCs can cause visual field defects or even irreversible vision loss. There is no effective drug treatment in clinical practice for the loss of the visual field that is caused by the oxidation and apoptosis of RGCs. Hence, finding a drug with neuroprotective and antioxidant functions is urgently needed. As a new type of nanomaterial, tetrahedral framework nucleic  (tFNAs) exhibit outstanding biocompatibility and have been shown in our previous studies to participate in the positive regulation of cell behavior. In this experiment, we first established a cellular model of oxidative stress in RGCs with tert-butyl peroxide (TBHP). Then, we primarily explored the antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of tFNAs after TBHP-induced oxidative stress and the main mechanisms by which the tFNAs function. Our research showed that tFNAs could reduce the production of reactive  species (ROS) in cells and protect the cells from oxidative stress by regulating intracellular oxidation-related enzymes. In addition, tFNAs could simultaneously improve oxidative stress-induced apoptosis significantly via affecting the expression of apoptosis-related proteins. Finally, we confirmed by western blotting that the mechanism by which tFNAs prevent damage caused by oxidative stress involves activating the Akt/Nrf2 pathway. Our findings provide new ideas for the prevention and treatment of a series of diseases that are caused by oxidative stress to RGCs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671675>Natural Sulfur-Containing Compounds: An Alternative Therapeutic Strategy against Liver Fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Liver fibrosis is a pathophysiologic process involving the accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins as collagen deposition. Advanced liver fibrosis can evolve in cirrhosis, portal hypertension and often requires liver transplantation. At the cellular level, hepatic fibrosis involves the activation of hepatic stellate cells and their transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts. Numerous pro-fibrogenic mediators including the transforming growth factor-β1, the platelet-derived growth factor, endothelin-1, toll-like receptor 4, and reactive  species are key players in this process. Knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying hepatic fibrosis development need to be extended to find novel therapeutic strategies. Antifibrotic therapies aim to inhibit the accumulation of fibrogenic cells and/or prevent the deposition of extracellular matrix proteins. Natural products from terrestrial and marine sources, including sulfur-containing compounds, exhibit promising activities for the treatment of fibrotic pathology. Although many therapeutic interventions are effective in experimental models of liver fibrosis, their efficacy and safety in humans are largely unknown. This review aims to provide a reference collection on experimentally tested natural anti-fibrotic compounds, with particular attention on sulfur-containing molecules. Their chemical structure, sources, mode of action, molecular targets, and pharmacological activity in the treatment of liver disease will be discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638739>5-Aminolevulinic -Loaded Hyaluronic  Dissolving Microneedles for Effective Photodynamic Therapy of Superficial Tumors with Enhanced Long-Term Stability.</a></h2><p>5-Aminolevulinic  (5-ALA) is one of the most widely used prodrug in clinical photodynamic therapy of dermatological diseases and cancers; yet, its clinical application is still limited by the shallow skin penetration and unsatisfied stability in any existed formulations. Here, 5-ALA-loaded hyaluronic  dissolving microneedles (5-ALA@HAMNs) are prepared for photodynamic therapy of superficial tumors. The HAMNs can not only assist the loaded 5-ALA to effectively penetrate the stratum corneum but also provide 5-ALA with an acidic and -free environment to reduce the dimerization of 5-ALA molecules via Schiff-base bonds and formation of inactive pyrazine derivatives, thus maintaining its chemical structure and biological activity. The chemical stability of 5-ALA in HAMNs is confirmed by UV-vis spectra and mass spectra measurements. The 5-ALA@HAMNs display remarkable tumor elimination both in vitro and in vivo, even after storage at room temperature for nine months, making it a highly potential device for effective delivery of 5-ALA in cancer photodynamic therapy.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Adipose tissue is a vital metabolic organ in energy balance and glucose homeostasis. In this study, we investigated the role of VDR expressed on adipose tissue in the balance of energy metabolism. This study was conducted in VDR-KO mice, VDR-Tg mice and wild-type mice. Energy metabolism was determined based on the energy expenditure,  consumption, respiratory exchange rate, food and water intake, and a cool room test. VDR expression in the tissues of VDR-Tg mice was assessed by western blotting. The levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty , leptin, and glucose were assessed using the respective kits. Insulin resistance in the whole body was evaluated by an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test. mRNA associated with energy metabolism expression in adipose and skeletal muscle tissue was examined by RT-PCR. Our results show that overexpression of VDR in adipose tissue induced an increase in body weight, fat mass, and serum lipid levels, and a decline in energy metabolism; these changes were ameliorated by VDR-KO mice. Overexpression of VDR in the adipose tissue of VDR-Tg mice induced a state of insulin resistance, which corresponded with decreased expression of UCP1, UCP2, UCP3, CPT2 and HK in both white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue; these changes were also reversed by VDR-KO mice. Our study confirms that expression levels of VDR in adipose tissue play pivotal roles in energy balance and glycolipid metabolism by regulating adipose tissue remodeling.Copyright © 2019.

However, studies have failed to control for habitual physical activity levels, which directly influences both mtDNA copy number and insulin sensitivity. We, therefore, examined whether physical conditioning status (maximal  uptake, V̇O) was associated with skeletal muscle mitochondrial volume and mtDNA, and was predictive of T2DM in overweight, middle-aged men.Whole-body physiological (ISI-insulin sensitivity index, HOMA-IR, V̇O) and muscle biochemical/molecular (vastus lateralis; mtDNA, mitochondrial and glycolytic enzymes activity, lipid content and markers of lipid peroxidation) measurements were performed in three groups of overweight, middle-aged male volunteers (n = 10 per group): sedentary T2DM (ST2DM); sedentary control (SC) and non-sedentary control (NSC), who differed in aerobic capacity (ST2DM < SC < NSC).mtDNA was greater in NSC versus SC and ST2DM (P < 0.001; P < 0.001), and less in ST2DM versus SC (P < 0.01). Across all groups, mtDNA positively correlated with ISI (P < 0.001; r = 0.688) and V̇O (normalised to free fat mass; r = 0.684, P < 0.001), and negatively correlated to HOMA-IR (r = -0.544, P < 0.01). The activity of mitochondrial enzymes (GluDH, CS and β-HAD) was greater in NSC than ST2DM (P < 0.01, P < 0.001 and P < 0.05) and SC (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 and P < 0.05), but similar between ST2DM and SC. Intramuscular-free fatty , triglycerides and malondialdehyde contents were similar between ST2DM and SC.Body composition and indices of muscle mitochondrial volume/function were similar between SC and ST2DM. However, mtDNA differed and was positively associated with ISI, HOMA-IR and V̇O across all groups. Collectively, the findings support the contention that habitual physical activity is a key component of T2DM development, possibly by influencing mtDNA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606600>Effect of additional food waste slurry generated by mesophilic acidogenic fermentation on nutrient removal and sludge properties during wastewater treatment.</a></h2><p>Fermentation slurry from food waste (FSFW) generated by acidogenic fermentation at mesophilic temperature was utilized to improve the nutrients removal from wastewater. Organic  (such as lactate and volatile fatty ) in the FSFW behaved as readily biodegradable carbon sources, while the particulate and macromolecular organics acted as slowly biodegradable carbon sources during denitrification processes. The FSFW dosage significantly influenced the nitrogen removal performance, and a C/N ratio (in terms of chemical  demand to nitrogen ratio) of 8 could achieve complete denitrification in the batch tests. In a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) using FSFW for long-term wastewater treatment, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) gradually accumulated, sludge particle size significantly increased, and microbial communities were selectively enriched, which contributed to promoting the nitrogen (>80%) and phosphate (90.1%) removal efficiencies. Overall, the FSFW produced by acidogenic fermentation under mesophilic temperature served as an excellent intermediary between FW valorization and wastewater treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Low-energy conformers for Zn(Thr-H)(ACN) (where ACN = acetonitrile), Zn(Gly-H)(ACN) (formed via CO-laser irradiation of intact Zn(Thr-H)(ACN)), and CdCl(Thr) complexes were found using quantum chemical calculations in order to identify the structures formed experimentally. For all species, the predicted ground structures reproduce the experimental spectra well, where tridentate [N, CO, OH] binding motifs were dominantly observed for the intact Zn(Thr-H)(ACN) and CdCl(Thr) complexes. In both of these cases, the metal center binds to the backbone amino group (N), carbonyl  (CO, where this site is deprotonated in the Zn complex), and side-chain hydroxyl  (OH). For the Zn system, there also appears to be a population of a higher-energy species in which the side chain is deprotonated, either [N, O, CO] or [N, O, OH]. CO-laser irradiation of Zn(Thr-H)(ACN) leads to loss of its side chain via elimination of acetaldehyde, yielding a bidentate Zn(Gly-H)[N, CO](ACN) complex. Overall, this work explores the binding interactions between Thr and biologically relevant metals in a prototypical environment. Comparison of current work with previous analyses allows for the elucidation of important metal dependent trends associated with physiologically important metal-amino  binding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669601>Alteration of mitochondrial DNA homeostasis in drug-induced liver injury.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes for 13 proteins involved in the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) process. In liver, genetic or acquired impairment of mtDNA homeostasis can reduce ATP output but also decrease fatty  oxidation, thus leading to different hepatic lesions including massive necrosis and microvesicular steatosis. Hence, a severe impairment of mtDNA homeostasis can lead to liver failure and death. An increasing number of investigations report that some drugs can induce mitochondrial dysfunction and drug-induced liver injury (DILI) by altering mtDNA homeostasis. Some drugs such as ciprofloxacin, antiretroviral nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and tacrine can inhibit hepatic mtDNA replication, thus inducing mtDNA depletion. Drug-induced reduced mtDNA levels can also be the consequence of reactive  species-mediated oxidative damage to mtDNA, which triggers its degradation by mitochondrial nucleases. Such mechanism is suspected for acetaminophen and troglitazone. Other pharmaceuticals such as linezolid and tetracyclines can impair mtDNA translation, thus selectively reducing the synthesis of the 13 mtDNA-encoded proteins. Lastly, some drugs might alter the mtDNA methylation status but the pathophysiological consequences of such alteration are still unclear. Drug-induced impairment of mtDNA homeostasis is probably under-recognized since preclinical and post-marketing safety studies do not classically investigate mtDNA levels, mitochondrial protein synthesis and mtDNA oxidative damage.Copyright © 2019.

These pathological conditions make mitochondria of a particular interest in the regulation of cell function and death by both apoptosis and autophagy. Therefore, this work was undertaken to investigate mitochondria function, autophagy and apoptosis protein markers in the kidney from rat model of intra-abdominal obesity and renal damage induced by high sucrose diet. Mitochondria from sucrose fed (SF) kidney in the presence of pyruvate/malate generated hydrogen peroxide (HO) at a higher rate than from control (79.81 ± 4.98 vs 65.84 ± 1.95 pmol/min/mg protein). With succinate, the release of HO was significantly higher compared with pyruvate/malate and it remained higher in SF than in control mitochondria (146.4 ± 8.8 vs 106.1 ± 5.9 pmol/min/mg protein). However, cytochrome c release from SF kidney mitochondria was lower than from control. In addition, cardiolipin, a mitochondrial-specific phospholipid was found increased in SF mitochondria due to the enhanced amount of both cardiolipin synthase and tafazzin. Cardiolipin was also found enriched with saturated and monounsaturated fatty  which are less susceptible to peroxidative stress involved in cytochrome c release. Furthermore, Beclin-1, LC3-B, as autophagy protein markers, and caspase 9 as apoptosis protein marker, were found decreased in SF kidney. These results suggest that the decline of autophagy protein markers and the lack of apoptosis process could be a pathological mechanism of cell dysfunction leading to the progression of renal disease in SF rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666518>Redox-governed charge doping dictated by interfacial diffusion in two-dimensional materials.</a></h2><p>Controlling extra charge carriers is pivotal in manipulating electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of various two-dimensional materials.

The impact on neuro-inflammation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and the brain levels of monoamines and GABA were investigated.Rats were divided into the following: normal control, hypoxia model induced by sodium nitrite (75 mg/kg s.c), and hypoxic rats pre-treated with CAR (250 mg/kg), ARG (200 mg/kg), and their combination.Data revealed that hypoxia induced significant elevation of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and its receptor reflecting the stimulation of angiogenesis. Hypoxia also resulted in increased inflammatory mediators-including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). In addition, hypoxia initiates cerebral apoptosis as revealed by increased caspase-3 and BAX with reduced Bcl-2. These changes were associated with reduced brain levels of GABA and monoamines including noradrenaline (NADR), dopamine (DOP), and serotonin (SER). Pre-treatment with ARG and/or CAR significantly mitigated the neural changes induced by hypoxia and attenuated the elevated levels of NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-6, caspase-3, and BAX, while ameliorated the reduced levels of Bcl-2, NADR, DOP, SER, and GABA, with the best improvement observed with the combination. Further elevation of the angiogenic markers was observed indicating their role in boosting  delivery to brain.CAR, ARG, and, importantly, their combination could effectively protect against hypoxia-induced neurotoxicity, via their angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties in addition to reversing the effect on GABA and monoamines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656961>Adsorption of aromatic carboxylic  on carbon nanotubes: impact of surface functionalization, molecular size and structure.</a></h2><p>A large quantity of emerging contaminants are ionizable, and the ionized compounds display different adsorption behaviors than their neutral counterparts. In particular, a strong intermolecular force, negative charge assisted hydrogen bonding ((-)CAHB), was recently identified, which explains the unusually strong adsorption of negatively charged compounds on carbon nanotubes with -containing functional groups. However, most previous studies only probed molecules with one benzene ring. The adsorption of ionizable compounds with more than one benzene ring and additional functional groups has not been examined. This study investigated the effect of surface functionalization, molecular size and structure of six aromatic carboxylic  on their adsorption on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) in batch reactors. In addition, the short-range interactions of the neutral  with MWNTs were calculated to evaluate the effect of aromaticity and bulkiness. Hydrophobicity and electrostatic interactions dominate the intermolecular forces between ionized contaminants and MWNT surfaces. pH dependent octanol/water partitioning coefficient (Dow) is a more precise indicator of the adsorption of ionizable compounds on MWNTs. (-)CAHB is a significant force only for compounds with one benzene ring.

Anaerobic processes are suitable for the treatment of wastewater high in organics to achieve pollution control and recovery of energy as methane and hydrogen, or intermediates for production of biofuels and valuable biochemicals. A distinction between protein hydrolysis and amino  fermentation, especially for dissolved proteins, is needed to target which one is truly rate-limiting and to effectively harvest bioproducts during anaerobic conversion of these wastewaters. This study explored mesophilic anaerobic hydrolysis and amino  fermentation of gelatine, as a model for dissolved proteins, at pH 7 and at pH 5.The results showed that at pH 7, protein hydrolysis (first-order rate of 0.15 h) was approximately 5 times faster than acidification of the hydrolysis products (first-order rate of 0.03 h), implying that not hydrolysis but acidification was the rate-limiting step in anaerobic dissolved protein degradation. This was confirmed by (temporary) accumulation of amino . Nineteen different amino  were detected during the first 8 incubation hours of gelatine at neutral pH and the total chemical  demand (COD) of these 19 amino  was up to approximately 40% of the COD of the gelatine that was added. Protein hydrolysis at pH 5 was 2-25 times slower than at pH 7. Shifting the initial pH from neutral to acidic conditions (pH 5) inhibited protein degradation and changed the volatile fatty  (VFA) product profile. Furthermore, the presence or absence of methanogenic activity did not affect the rates of protein hydrolysis and acidification.The findings in this study can help to set a suitable solid retention time to accomplish anaerobic degradation of protein-rich wastewaters in continuous reactor systems. For example, if the target is harvesting VFAs, methanogens can be washed-out for a shorter retention time while amino  fermentation, instead of hydrolysis as assumed previously, will govern the design and solutions to improve the system dealing with dissolved proteins.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613743> sp. nov., an obligately chemolithoautotrophic, sulfur-oxidizing bacterium isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent environment.</a></h2><p>A new mesophilic bacterium, designated strain 13-15A, was isolated from the deep-sea water from the Carlsberg Ridge, northwestern Indian Ocean.

Endometriosis is a common gynecologic disease that affects women of reproductive age. Recent studies have indicated that oxidative stress may be involved in the pathophysiology of endometriosis. It has been reported that microRNAs can regulate the cellular response to oxidative stress, and mounting evidence indicates that fatty  binding protein 4 (FABP4) plays an essential role in the regulation of systemic redox capacity. In the present study, we demonstrated that miR‑455 is a putative FABP4‑targeting miRNA. A luciferase activity assay revealed that miR‑455 can successfully bind to the 3'‑UTR of FABP4. Overexpression of miR‑455 led to the downregulation of FABP4 at both the mRNA and protein levels in a human endometrial stromal cell line. Then, the roles of miR‑455 and FABP4 in oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in human endometrial stromal cells were examined. We found that ectopic expression of miR‑455 protected cells from damage caused by H2O2. Further investigation found that forced expression of miR‑455 reduced the level of reactive  species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), while the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH‑Px) were promoted. Silencing of FABP4 also generated cytoprotective effects against H2O2 in human endometrial stromal cells. Moreover, overexpression FABP4 abrogated the miR‑455‑mediated antioxidative stress effects in cells. Taken together, we propose that miR‑455 protects human endometrial stromal cells from oxidative stress at least partly via regulation of FABP4.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661289>Enhanced Reactive  Species Levels by Active Benzothiazole Complex mediated Fenton Reaction for Highly Effective Anti-tumor Therapy.</a></h2><p>Breaking the threshold of intracellular reactive  species (ROS) levels can cause non-specific oxidative damage to proteins, and lead to the Fenton reaction-mediated exogenous ROS production to be a new promising anticancer strategy. However, the problems including the inefficient transport of metal catalysts and insufficient endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content in cells still need to be improved. In this study, functional nanosystem encapsulated with benzothiazole complexes (FeTB2) and the photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG) was designed for highly effective antitumor therapy. The surface of the nanocarriers was modified with dihydroartemisinin (DHA)-grafted polyglutamic . The induced hyperthermia enables the lipid-polymer shell to depolymerize, releasing FeTB2. The released FeTB2 could kill tumor cells in two different ways by inhibiting DNA replication and catalyzing H2O2 to produce active •OH. Moreover, the conjugated DHA could increase the amount of peroxides in tumor cells and significantly enhance ROS yield.

Oxidative stress played a key role in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. Our aim of this study was to investigate whether high glucose could provoke microvesicles generation from podocytes and its potential mechanism. Mouse podocyte clone 5 (MPC-5) were stimulated by high glucose. The intracellular reactive  species (ROS) of podocytes were measured by fluorescence microscopy with the probe of CM-H2DCFDA and MitoSOXTM. Antioxidants N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and alpha lipoic  (α-LA) were used to treat podocytes after high glucose stimulation. The rate of podocyte apoptosis was evaluated with Annexin V-FITC by flow cytometry. NOX4 expression was examined and siRNA were performed to explore the mechanism of MVs generation. The quantities of MVs from MPC-5 cells was significantly increased (P&lt;0.05) by 4.6 times after 30 mM glucose stimulation, accompanied with double increased apoptosis. Cellular ROS generation was increased by high glucose at the peak of 48h stimulation. High glucose induced MVs was significantly decreased by 52.9% after pretreatment by antioxidant NAC. Nevertheless, Mitochondrial ROS in podocytes reached a peak at 4h stimulation, but specific antioxidant α-LA had no effect on the production of MVs (P&gt;0.05). Levels of NOX4 mRNA and protein expression were significantly upregulated by high glucose (P&lt;0.05). Podocyte-derived MVs by high glucose were eliminated by NOX4 siRNA. High glucose can provoke MVs generation from glomerular podocytes through ROS/NOX4 pathway, not from mitochondrial pathway.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611791>Neuroprotective Effects and Mechanisms of Zhenlong Xingnao Capsule in  and  Models of Hypoxia.</a></h2><p>Zhenlong Xingnao Capsule (ZXC) is a Tibetan medicine used to treat ischemic stroke.

The elucidation of the physiological and biochemical events implicated in the transition from dormancy to germination in different plant species such as sunflower becomes a topic of interest. In this study we investigated the spatio-temporal variation of salicylic  (SA), hydrogen peroxide (H O ) and the activity of two antioxidant enzymes (catalase, CAT-EC 1.11.1.6-, and ascorbate peroxidase, APX-EC1.11.1.11-) in embryonic axis and cotyledons of dry and imbibed seeds of dormant (B123) and nondormant (B91) sunflower lines. The results showed that embryonic axis had higher level of SA and H O than cotyledons in both lines. In dry seeds, B123 embryo (embryonic axis + cotyledons) showed a higher SA content than B91. After dry storage at room temperature, SA decreased in B123 embryos to a value close to that registered in B91embryos. B123 embryonic axis of dry seeds presented higher H O levels than B91. Dry storage led to an increase of H O levels and a decrease of CAT activity in B123 embryonic axis. During imbibition, B123 seeds stored for 33 days displayed an increase in SA level in the embryonic axis (3 h of imbibition) and this lower level correlated with a decrease in H O (6 h of imbibition). Thus, the embryo-imposed dormancy in B123 dry seeds was associated with high levels of SA and low H O , whereas the dormancy release was linked with SA decrease and increase of H O as a consequence of lower CAT activity.

To that end, we report a strategy for the ready fabrication of -doped graphitic carbon nitride (CN) with engendered nitrogen deficiencies. The addition of KOH and oxalic  during the thermal condensation of urea led to a material that exhibits a significantly higher pseudo-first-order rate constant for the degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) (0.0225 min) compared to that of CN (0.00222 min). The enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of BPA exhibited by the dual-defect-modified CN (Bt-OA-CN) is ascribable to a considerable red-shift in its light absorption compared to that of CN, as well as its modulated energy band structure and more-efficient charge separation. Furthermore, we confirmed that the in-situ-formed cyano groups in the Bt-OA-CN photocatalyst act as strong electron-withdrawing groups that efficiently separate and transfer photo-generated charge carriers to the surface of the photocatalyst. This study provides novel insight into the in-situ dual-defect strategy for g-CN, which is extendable to the modification of other photocatalysts; it also introduces Bt-OA-CN as a potential highly efficient visible-light-responsive photocatalyst for use in environmental-remediation applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637540>Dietary GABA enhances hypoxia tolerance of a bottom-dwelling carp, Cirrhinus mrigala by modulating HIF-1α, thyroid hormones and metabolic responses.</a></h2><p>The Indian major carp, mrigal (Cirrhinus mrigala), is a bottom-dwelling fish that can survive hypoxic episodes in its natural environment. We hypothesise that it can better survive hypoxic conditions by altering metabolic responses through GABA (Gamma-aminobutyric ) supplementation. In the first experiment, the hypoxia tolerance time of the fishes was evaluated under extreme anoxic conditions after feeding with GABA, which showed that GABA had improved survival time under hypoxia. To study the response of dietary GABA in hypoxia-exposed fish, the branchial HIF-1α expression levels, serum thyroid hormone levels and hepatic metabolic responses were assessed in the subsequent experiment. The treatment groups were fed for 60 days with experimental diets containing 4 levels of GABA (0.00% G, 0.50% G, 0.75% G and 1.0%G) and were subjected to 72-h hypoxia exposure (0.5 ± 0.02 mg L dissolved  (DO)) whereas a control group was maintained under normoxic conditions (6.0 ± 0.21 mg L DO). The five treatment groups with three replicates were C0 (0% G + normoxia), H0 (0% G + hypoxia), H0.5 (0.50% G + hypoxia), H0.75 (0.75% G + hypoxia) and H1.0 (1.00% G + hypoxia). The results indicated that GABA supplementation triggered downregulation of HIF 1 alpha expression. When compared with the control group, decreased thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) levels were observed in the GABA-fed hypoxic groups. However, TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) level remained unchanged in all the treatments. The LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) level in hypoxia-exposed groups was decreased by GABA supplementation. Our study demonstrated that GABA supplementation restores acute hypoxia-induced HIF-1α expression, thyroid hormone levels and LDH activities. On the other hand, it enhanced the citrate synthase (CS) activities at 0.5-1.00%, which showed a sharp decline in hypoxia. Hypoxia caused increase in the serum metabolites such as glucose, lactate, cholesterol and triglycerides. However, GABA supplementation was partially effective in reducing glucose and lactate level while triglycerides and cholesterol values remained unchanged. Overall, our results suggested a potential role of GABA in suppressing metabolism during hypoxia exposure, which can increase the chances of survival of the species Cirrhinus mrigala during hypoxia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613384>The Interactions of Dopamine and Oxidative Damage in the Striatum of Neurodegenerative Diseases Patients.</a></h2><p>The striatum with a number of dopamine containing neurons, receiving projections from the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area; plays a critical role in neurodegenerative diseases of motor and memory function. Additionally, oxidative damage to nucleic  may be vital in the development of age-associated neurodegeneration. The metabolism of dopamine is recognized as one of the sources of reactive  species through the Fenton mechanism. The proposed interactions of oxidative insults and dopamine in the striatum during the progression of diseases are the hypotheses of most interest to our study. This study investigated the possibility of significant interactions between these molecules that are involved in the late-stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), Parkinson disease dementia (PDD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and controls using ELISA assays, autoradiography, and mRNA in situ hybridization assay. Interestingly, lower DNA/RNA oxidative adducts levels in the caudate and putamen of diseased brains were observed with the exception of an increased DNA oxidative product in the caudate of AD brains. Similar changes were found for dopamine concentration and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 densities (VMAT2). We also found that downstream presynaptic dopamine D1 Receptor binding correlated with dopamine loss in LBD groups, and RNA damage and BACE1 in the caudate of AD. This is the first demonstration of region-specific alterations of DNA/RNA oxidative damage which cannot be viewed in isolation, but rather in connection with the interrelationship between different neuronal events; chiefly DNA oxidative adducts and density of VMAT2 in AD and PD patients.© 2019 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622161>Chronic effects of high intensity interval training on postprandial lipaemia in healthy males.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to determine thechronic (≥72h post-exercise) effects of high intensity interval training (HIIT) on postprandial lipaemia and metabolic markers in healthy volunteers. Eight physically active young males (Mean ± SD: age 22 ± 3years, height 1.77 ± 0.07m, body mass 67.7 ± 6.2kg) underwent two 6h mixed-meal tolerance tests and resting vastus lateralis muscle biopsies, before the first- and ≥72h after the final-session of four weeks of HIIT (16 sessions in total; 10x60s bouts of cycling at 90% maximal  uptake [V̇O], interspersed by 60s intervals at 45% V̇O). Arterialised and deep venous blood samples across the forearm, brachial artery blood flow measurements, and whole-body indirect calorimetry data were obtained before, and at regular intervals for 6h after, consumption of a standardised mixed-meal. The main findings revealed that, when assessed ≥72h post-exercise, postprandial free fatty  (FFA) uptake across the forearm was increased in response to exercise training (= 0.025). However, four weeks of HIIT did not alter fasting or postprandial circulating triglyceride (TAG) concentrations, or their tissue uptake, despite a 10.2 ± 7.7% improvement in V̇O(= 0.004). Protein content of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) in the vastus lateralis at rest was reduced by 25 ± 21% (= 0.01). Collectively, these findings suggest that 4 weeks of HITT enhances postprandial clearance of FFA, when assessed ≥72h post-exercise, but does not confer persisting (training) adaptations in postprandial triglyceridaemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670182>Potential of esterase DmtH in transforming plastic additive dimethyl terephthalate to less toxic mono-methyl terephthalate.</a></h2><p>Dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) is a primary ingredient widely used in the manufacture of polyesters and industrial plastics; its environmental fate is of concern due to its global use. Microorganisms play key roles in the dissipation of DMT from the environment; however, the enzymes responsible for the initial transformation of DMT and the possible altered toxicity due to this biotransformation have not been extensively studied. To reduce DMT toxicity, we identified the esterase gene dmtH involved in the initial transformation of DMT from the AOPP herbicide-transforming strain Sphingobium sp. C3. DmtH shows 24-41% identity with α/β-hydrolases and belongs to subfamily V of bacterial esterases. The purified recombinant DmtH was capable of transforming DMT to mono-methyl terephthalate (MMT) and potentially transforming other p-phthalic  esters, including diallyl terephthalate (DAT) and diethyl terephthalate (DET). Using C. elegans as an assay model, we observed the severe toxicity of DMT in inducing reactive  species (ROS) production, decreasing locomotion behavior, reducing lifespan, altering molecular basis for oxidative stress, and inducing mitochondrial stress. In contrast, exposure to MMT did not cause obvious toxicity, induce oxidative stress, and activate mitochondrial stress in nematodes. Our study highlights the usefulness of Sphingobium sp. C3 and its esterase DmtH in transforming p-phthalic  esters and reducing the toxicity of DMT to organisms.Copyright © 2019.

In the present study, we treated mice with high-cholesterol diets following exposure to acute hypoxic stress and evaluated the effects of the diets on whole-body, liver glucose, and liver fat metabolism. For rapid cholesterol liver uptake, 6-week-old male C57BL/J6 mice were fed with high-cholesterol/cholic  (CH) diet for 6 weeks and then were exposed to gradual  level reduction for 1 h and hypoxia at 7%  for additional 1 hour using a hypoxic chamber. Animals were than sacrificed, and metabolic markers were evaluated. Hypoxic treatment had a strong hypoglycemic effect that was completely blunted by CH treatment. Decreases in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis as well as an increase in ketone body formation were observed. Such changes indicate a metabolic shift from glucose to fat utilization due to activation of the inducible nitric oxide synthase/AMPK axis in the CH-treated animals. Increased ketogenesis was also observed in vitro in hepatocytes after cholesterol treatment. In conclusion, our results show for the first time that cholesterol contributes to metabolic shift and adaptation to hypoxia in vivo and in vitro through induction of HIF-1 and iNOS expression.Copyright © 2019 Naama Miron and Oren Tirosh.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605904>Identification, characterization, and antifungal activity of cysteine peptidases from Calotropis procera latex.</a></h2><p>Cysteine peptidases (EC 3.4.22) are the most abundant enzymes in latex fluids. However, their physiological functions are still poorly understood, mainly related to defense against phytopathogens. The present study reports the cDNA cloning and sequencing of five undescribed cysteine peptidases from Calotropis procera (Aiton) Dryand (Apocynaceae) as well as some in silico analyses. Of these, three cysteine peptidases (CpCP1, CpCP2, and CpCP3) were purified. Their enzymatic kinetics were determined and they were assayed for their efficacy in inhibiting the hyphal growth of phytopathogenic fungi. The mechanism of action was investigated by fluorescence and atomic force microscopy as well as by induction of reactive  species (ROS). The deduced amino  sequences showed similar biochemical characteristics and high sequence homology with several other papain-like cysteine peptidases. Three-dimensional models showed two typical cysteine peptidase domains (L and R domains), forming a "V-shaped" active site containing the catalytic triad (Cys, His, and Asn). Proteolysis of CpCP1 was higher at pH 7.0, whereas for CpCP2 and CpCP3 it was higher at 7.5. All peptidases exhibited optimum activity at 35 °C and followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. However, the major difference among them was that CpCP1 exhibited highest V, K, K and catalytic efficiency. All peptidases were deleterious to the two fungi tested, with IC of around 50 μg/mL. The peptidases promoted membrane permeabilization, morphological changes with leakage of cellular content, and induction of ROS in F. oxysporum spores. These results corroborate the hypothesis that latex cysteine peptidases play a role in defense against fungi.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is an excellent breeding system for exploitation of heterosis, which has great potential to increase crop yields. To understand the molecular mechanism of CMS in cotton, we compared transcriptome, cytomorphological, physiological and bioinformatics data between the CMS line C2P5A and its maintainer line C2P5B. By using high-throughput sequencing technology, 178,166 transcripts were assembled and 2013 differentially expression genes (DEGs) were identified at three different stages of C2P5A anther development. In this study, we identified DEGs associated with reactive  species (ROS), peroxisomes, aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH), cytochrome oxidase subunit VI, and cytochrome P450, and DEGs associated with tapetum development, Jojoba acyl-CoA reductase-related male sterility protein, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and MYB transcription factors. The abnormal expression of one of these genes may be responsible for the CMS C2P5A line. In gene ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment, DEGs were mainly related to carbohydrate metabolism, amino  metabolism, transport and catabolism, and signal transduction. Carbohydrate metabolism provides energy for anther development, starch and sucrose metabolism, fatty  biosynthesis and metabolism and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism. These results showed that numerous genes and multiple complex metabolic pathways regulate cotton anther development. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) indicated that three modules, 'turquoise,' 'blue,' and 'green,' were specific for the CMS C2P5A line. The 'turquoise' and 'blue' modules were mainly related to carbohydrate metabolism, amino  metabolism, energy metabolism, peroxisomes, pyruvate metabolism as well as fatty  degradation. The 'green' module was mainly related to energy metabolism, carbon metabolism, translation, and lipid metabolism. RNA-sequencing and WGCNA polymerization modules were screened for key genes and pathways related to CMS in cotton. This study presents a new perspective for further research into the metabolic pathways of pollen abortion in the CMS C2P5A line and also provides a theoretical basis for its breeding and production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658544>[Preliminary study on effect of intraoperative goal-directed fluid management on pulmonary function and  dynamics in patients with severe burns].</a></h2><p> To preliminarily investigate the effect of intraoperative goal-directed fluid management (GDFM) on pulmonary function and  dynamics in patients with severe burns.  From February 2017 to May 2018, 30 patients admitted to Burn Department of our hospital with severe burns who met the criteria for inclusion and needed escharectomy and skin grafting were enrolled in this prospective randomized controlled trial. The patients were divided into group GDFM of 15 cases [14 males and 1 female, (45±14) years old] and conventional liquid management group of 15 cases [12 males and 3 females, (42±10) years old] according to the random number table. During escharectomy and skin grafting, volume of patients in group GDFM was managed according to the GDFM scheme, based on cardiac output index, stroke volume variation, stroke volume index, hemoglobin, central venous  saturation (ScvO(2)), and other parameters; volume of patients in conventional liquid management group was managed according to clinical experience and conventional liquid management scheme, based on mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, urine output, hemoglobin, and other parameters. At post operation hour (POH) 1, 6, 12, and 24, arterial and venous blood was collected from patients of the two groups to determine the levels of extravascular lung water index (ELWI), global end-diastolic volume index (GEDI), oxygenation index, ScvO(2), central venous-to-arterial blood carbon dioxide partial pressure difference (Pcv-aCO(2)), lactic , pH value, bicarbonate ion, and base excess routinely. Data were processed with Fisher's exact probability test,  test, analysis of variance for repeated measurement, and least significant difference test.  (1) The ELWI of patients in group GDFM was (4.3±1.1) mL/kg at POH 1, which was significantly lower than (6.5±3.6) mL/kg in conventional liquid management group (=2.26, <0.05).

In conventional liquid management group, the oxygenation index of patients at POH 6 was significantly higher than that at POH 1, 12, or 24 (<0.01).

The ScvO(2) levels of patients in the two groups at POH 6, 12, and 24 were significantly higher than those levels at POH 1 within the same group (<0.01), and the ScvO(2) of patients in conventional liquid management group at POH 24 was significantly higher than that at POH 6 or 12 within the same group (<0.05 or <0.01). The Pcv-aCO(2) levels of patients in group GDFM were significantly lower than those in conventional liquid management group at POH 1 and 6 (=2.55, 2.71, <0.05). The Pcv-aCO(2) of patients in group GDFM at POH 12 was significantly lower than that at POH 6 or 24 within the same group (<0.05). (3) The blood lactic  levels and pH values between patients of the two groups were similar at POH 1, 6, 12, and 24 (=0.89, 0.19, 0.26, 0.23; 1.55, 0.71, 0.77, 0.77, >0.05). In conventional liquid management group, the blood lactic  levels of patients at POH 6, 12, and 24 were significantly lower than the level at POH 1 within the same group (<0.05), and the pH values of patients at POH 6, 12, and 24 were significantly higher than the value at POH 1 within the same group (<0.05).

It was verified that on the surface isolated hydroxyl groups and the surface hydroxyl groups without  sites of these iron oxides, ozone was electrostatically adsorbed and did not interact with the surface of these oxides, stably existed as ozone molecule. In contrast, ozone could replace the surface hydroxyl groups on Lewis  sites of oxides, and directly interacted with the surface metal ions, decomposing into reactive  species (ROS) and initiating the surface metal redox.

On the other hand, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) were known to be able to promote heme synthesis in erythroid cells. Nevertheless, the effect of HDACi on heme homeostasis in non-erythrocytes remains unknown. We envisioned that the combination of HDACi and artesunate (ARS) might have synergistic antitumor activity through modulating heme synthesis.  studies revealed that combination of ARS and HDACi exerted synergistic tumor inhibition by inducing cell death. Moreover, this combination exhibited more effective antitumor activity than either ARS or HDACi monotherapy in xenograft models without apparent toxicity. Importantly, mechanistic studies revealed that HDACi coordinated with ARS to increase 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS1) expression, and subsequent heme production, leading to enhanced cytotoxicity of ARS. Notably, knocking down  significantly blunted the synergistic effect of ARS and HDACi on tumor inhibition, indicating a critical role of ALAS1 upregulation in mediating ARS cytotoxicity. Collectively, our study revealed the mechanism of synergistic antitumor action of ARS and HDACi. This finding indicates that modulation of heme synthesis pathway by the combination based on ARTs and other heme synthesis modulators represents a promising therapeutic approach to solid tumors.© 2019 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

Of these complexes, Ru-PhenISA and Ru-PhenAN are polymer conjugates containing less than 5%, (on a molar basis), photoactive units. Their performance is compared with that of a small [Ru(phen)] compound, [Ru(phen)BAP](OTf) (BAP = 4-(4'-aminobutyl)-1,10-phenanthroline, OTf = triflate anion), used as a model of the photoactive units. The polymer ligands, PhenISA and PhenAN, are polyamidoamines with different -base properties. At physiological pH, the former is zwitterionic, the latter moderately cationic, and both intrinsically cytocompatible. The photophysical characterizations show that the complexation to macromolecules does not hamper the Ru(phen) ability to generate toxic singlet  upon irradiation, and phosphorescence lifetimes and quantum yields are similar in all cases. All three compounds are internalized by HeLa cells and can induce cell death upon visible light irradiation. However, their relative PDT efficiency is different: the zwitterionic PhenISA endowed with the Ru-complex lowers the PDT efficiency of the free complex, while conversely, the cationic PhenAN boosts it. Flow cytometry demonstrates that the uptake efficiency of the three agents reflects the observed differences in PDT efficacy. Additionally, intracellular localization studies show that while [Ru(phen)BAP](OTf) remains confined in vesicular structures, Ru-PhenISA localization is hard to determine due to the very low uptake efficiency. Very interestingly, instead, the cationic Ru-PhenAN accumulates inside the nucleus in all treated cells. Overall, the results indicate that the complexation of [Ru(phen)BAP](OTf) with a cationic polyamidoamine to give the Ru-PhenAN complex is an excellent strategy to increase the Ru-complex cell uptake and, additionally, to achieve accumulation at the nuclear level. These unique features together make this compound an excellent photosensitizer with very high PDT efficiency.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619684>Metagenomes and metatranscriptomes from boreal potential and actual  sulfate soil materials.</a></h2><p>Natural sulfide rich deposits are common in coastal areas worldwide, including along the Baltic Sea coast.

In this work, a simple and efficient method of reduction of bicarbonate to formate on a simple Ni powder catalyst with water as the facile hydrogen source and Zn as the regenerable reductant is proposed. The Ni catalyst and in situ formed Zn/ZnO exhibited a synergetic catalytic activity in the conversion of bicarbonate into formate, and a good formate yield of 81% was obtained. Detailed studies revealed that the synergetic catalytic activity between Ni and the in situ formed Zn/ZnO was mainly attributed to (i) the inhibited oxidation of Zn by Ni, leading to more interface of Zn/ZnO; (ii) the decreased growth of ZnO crystal along the [0001] direction, and thus increasing the more polar (0001) Zn face and the (0001̅) O face, which have high activity; and (iii) the enhanced generation of more  vacancies at the Zn/ZnO interface to promote the formate yield.

On the basis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, the critical role of CO was revealed, which is to maintain the metallic state of reactive Ir species during the oxidation cycles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647248>Redox Proteomes in human physiology and disease mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Redox proteomics is a field of proteomics which is concerned with the characterization of the oxidation state of proteins in order to gain information about their modulated structure, function, activity and involvement in different physiological pathways. Oxidative modiﬁcations of proteins have been shown to be implicated in normal physiological processes of cells, as well as in pathomechanisms leading to the development of cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and some rare hereditary metabolic diseases, like classic galactosemia. Reactive  species (ROS) generate a variety of reversible and irreversible modiﬁcations of amino  residue side chains, and within the protein backbone. These oxidative post-translational modiﬁcations (Ox-PTMs) can participate in the activation of signal transduction pathways, and mediate the toxicity of harmful oxidants. Thus, the application of advanced redox proteomics technologies is important for gaining insights into molecular mechanisms of diseases. Mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics is one of the most powerful methods that can be used to give detailed qualitative and quantitative information on protein modifications and allows to characterize redox proteomes associated with diseases. The current review illustrates the role and biological consequences of Ox- PTMs under basal and oxidative stress (OS) conditions by focussing on protein carbonylation and S-glutathionylation, two abundant modifications with impact on cellular pathways that were intensively studied during the last decade.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650720>Tetrabromobisphenol A Promotes the Osteoclastogenesis of RAW264.7 Cells Induced by Receptor Activator of NF-kappa B Ligand In Vitro.</a></h2><p>Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), one of the most widely used brominated flame-retardants, is a representative persistent organic pollutants group. Studies on TBBPA toxicity have been conducted using various target cells; however, few studies have investigated TBBPA toxicity in bone cells. Therefore, this study investigated the in vitro effects of TBBPA on osteoclasts, a cell type involved in bone metabolism.RAW264.7 cells were cultured in medium containing 50 ng/mL receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) and varying concentrations of TBBPA. To evaluate the effects of TBBPA on the differentiation and function of osteoclasts, osteoclast-specific gene expression, tartrate-resistant  phosphatase (TRAP) activity, bone resorbing activity, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial superoxide were measured.The presence of 20 μ TBBPA significantly increased TRAP activity in RANKL-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, the bone resorbing activity of osteoclasts, and the gene expression of Akt2, nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1, and chloride channel voltage-sensitive 7. However, TBBPA treatment caused no change in the expression of carbonic anhydrase II, cathepsin K, osteopetrosis-associated transmembrane protein 1, , extracellular signal-related kinase, , , or matrix metalloproteinase 9. Furthermore, 20 μ TBBPA caused a significant decrease in MMP and a significant increase in mitochondrial superoxide production.This study suggests that TBBPA promotes osteoclast differentiation and activity. The mechanism of TBBPA-stimulated osteoclastogenesis might include increased expression of several genes involved in osteoclast differentiation and reactive  species production.© 2019 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632416>An Optimized Screen Reduces the Number of GA Transporters and Provides Insights Into Nitrate Transporter 1/Peptide Transporter Family Substrate Determinants.</a></h2><p>Based on recent in vitro data, a relatively large number of the plant nitrate transporter 1/peptide transporter family (NPF) proteins have been suggested to function as gibberellic  (GA) transporters. Most GA transporting NPF proteins also appear to transport other structurally unrelated phytohormones or metabolites. Several of the GAs used in previous in vitro assays are membrane permeable weak organic  whose movement across membranes are influenced by the pH-sensitive ion-trap mechanism. Moreover, a large proportion of in vitro GA transport activities have been demonstrated indirectly via long-term yeast-based GA-dependent growth assays that are limited to detecting transport of bioactive GAs. Thus, there is a need for an optimized transport assay for identifying and characterizing GA transport. Here, we develop an improved transport assay in Xenopus laevis oocytes, wherein we directly measure movement of six different GAs across oocyte membranes over short time. We show that membrane permeability of GAs in oocytes can be predicted based on number of  atoms and that several GAs do not diffuse over membranes regardless of changes in pH values. In addition, we show that small changes in internal cellular pH can result in strongly altered distribution of membrane permeable phytohormones. This prompts caution when interpreting heterologous transport activities. We use our transport assay to screen all Arabidopsis thaliana NPF proteins for transport activity towards six GAs (two membrane permeable and four non-permeable). The results presented here, significantly reduce the number of bona fide NPF GA transporters in Arabidopsis and narrow the activity to fewer subclades within the family. Furthermore, to gain first insight into the molecular determinants of substrate specificities toward organic molecules transported in the NPF, we charted all surface exposed amino  residues in the substrate-binding cavity and correlated them to GA transport. This analysis suggests distinct residues within the substrate-binding cavity that are shared between GA transporting NPF proteins; the potential roles of these residues in determining substrate specificity are discussed.Copyright © 2019 Wulff, Ernst, Jørgensen, Lambertz, Maierhofer, Belew, Crocoll, Motawia, Geiger, Jørgensen, Mirza and Nour-Eldin.</p></html>
