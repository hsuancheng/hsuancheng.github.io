ER stress-induced renal apoptosis seems to be involved in the development of diabetic nephropathy. The present study was designed to investigate the contribution of reduced ER stress to the beneficial effects of an angiotensin receptor blocker. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was induced by streptozotocin injections to hypertensive mRen2-transgenic rats. After 2weeks animals were treated with 0.7mg/kg/day . Blood glucose, blood pressure and protein excretion were assessed. Expression of ER stress markers was measured by real-time PCR. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect markers of ER stress, renal damage and infiltrating cells. Glomerulosclerosis and apoptosis were evaluated. Diabetic mRen2-transgenic rats developed renal injury with proteinuria, tubulointerstitial cell proliferation as well as glomerulosclerosis and podocyte injury. Moreover, an increase in , podocyte ER stress and apoptosis was detected.  somewhat lowered blood pressure and reduced proteinuria, tubulointerstitial cell proliferation and glomerulosclerosis. Podocyte damage was ameliorated but markers of ER stress (calnexin, grp78) and apoptosis were not reduced by . On the other hand, inflammatory cell infiltration in the tubulointerstitium and the glomerulus was significantly attenuated. We conclude that  reduced renal damage even in a very low dose. The beneficial effects of low dose  were paralleled by a reduction of blood pressure and  but not by a reduction of ER stress and apoptosis. Thus, sustained endoplasmic reticulum stress in the kidney does not necessarily lead to increased  and tubulointerstitial or glomerular injury.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

So, we investigated renal protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, alone and in combination with  in a rat model of diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic rats, injected with nicotinamide-streptozotocin, were treated orally for 12 weeks with either vehicle, dapagliflozin 2 mg/kg/day,  30 mg/kg/day, or combination of both drugs; respectively. Biochemical analysis included blood glucose, HbA1c, urinary albumin excretion, creatinine clearance, TGF-β1, sRAGE, oxidative markers, and histopathological examination of kidneys. Treatment with dapagliflozin, , and especially their combination, produced significant reduction in albuminuria, improved renal function parameters, increased sRAGE level and improved inflammatory and oxidative markers, together with amelioration of renal histopathological changes. Beside glycemic control, dapagliflozin produced higher sRAGE levels than , suggesting that inhibition of AGE-RAGE axis is important in its renoprotective action. Combination of dapagliflozin and  produced more remarkable protective effects on renal function and structure, than use of either agent alone. It is concluded that, combination of SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin and ARB,  could offer more effective renal protection and represent a promising therapeutic option for management of diabetic nephropathy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Chronic renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation, shown by elevated plasma renin activity (PRA), is implicated in many of the features of metabolic syndrome. The direct renin inhibitor aliskiren may be of benefit in this patient group as aliskiren targets the RAAS at the rate-limiting step. In this double-blind study, 141 patients with hypertension (mean baseline BP 155/93 mm Hg) and metabolic syndrome (modified National Cholesterol Education Program ATP III criteria) were randomized to aliskiren 300 mg or  300 mg once daily. Patients treated with aliskiren 300 mg had their mean sitting blood pressure (BP) lowered by 13.8/7.1 mm Hg after 12 weeks, significantly greater (P≤0.001) than the 5.8/2.8 mm Hg reduction observed in patients treated with  300 mg. A significantly greater proportion of patients treated with aliskiren achieved BP control to <135/85 mm Hg (29.2 vs 16.7% with ; P=0.019). Aliskiren treatment led to a 60% decrease in PRA from baseline, whereas  increased PRA by 99% (both P<0.001). Aliskiren and  had similar effects on glucose and lipid profiles and on a panel of biomarkers of  and cardiovascular risk. Both aliskiren and  were well tolerated. Collectively, these results suggest that aliskiren 300 mg may offer treatment benefits compared with  300 mg for BP reduction in patients with hypertension and metabolic syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30356256>AT1-receptor blockade: Protective effects of  in cardiomyocytes under hypoxic stress.</a></h1><p>Hypoxia induces myocardial injury through the activation of inflammatory and oxidative processes. The pivotal role of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases has been firmly established in clinical trials and practice; in fact many experimental and clinical data have highlighted that its inhibition has a cardioprotective role. Activated RAS also stimulates  directly inducing proinflammatory and oxidative gene expression. This study aimed to investigate the protective role of a pre-treatment (10 and 100 μM) with  on injury induced by 24 h of hypoxia in HL-1 cardiomyocytes; in particular, we have analyzed the natriuretic peptide (BNP) expression, a biomarker able to modulate inflammatory reaction to cardiac injury and some markers involved in oxidative stress and .

A total of 40 high-risk hypertensive outpatients with coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease and/or diabetes complications who were taking ARBs other than  and losartan were enrolled in this study. After a 4-week control period, the patients' prescribed ARBs were exchanged for an equivalent dose of . We assessed blood pressure, heart rate, serum UA level, parameters of lipid and glucose metabolism, cardiac and renal function and inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in blood samples taken immediately before the initiation of  treatment and again after 12 weeks of treatment. All 40 recruited patients were followed (31 men and 9 women, mean age: 68 years) without any dropouts. During the 12 weeks of  treatment, no significant changes in blood pressure, heart rate, parameters of lipid or glucose metabolism or other biomarkers of cardiac function, renal function, or  were observed. However, UA level (5.9±1.6 to 5.5±1.6 mg ml(-1), P=0.028) and the oxidative stress marker derivative reactive oxygen metabolites (dROMs) (354±83 to 310±65 U.CARR, P<0.001) were significantly lower at 12 weeks of treatment compared with before treatment.

Molecular mechanisms underlying this are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that c-Src activation, through receptor tyrosine kinase transactivation, is critically involved in synergistic interactions between Aldo and Ang II and that it is upstream of promigratory signaling pathways in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).VSMCs from WKY rats were studied. At low concentrations (10(-10) mol/L) Aldo and Ang II alone did not influence c-Src activation, whereas in combination they rapidly increased phosphorylation (P<0.01), an effect blocked by eplerenone (Aldo receptor antagonist) and  (AT1R blocker). This synergism was attenuated by AG1478 and AG1296 (inhibitors of EGFR and PDGFR, respectively), but not by AG1024 (IGFR inhibitor). Aldo and Ang II costimulation induced c-Src-dependent activation of NAD(P)H oxidase and c-Src-independent activation of ERK1/2 (P<0.05), without effect on ERK5, p38MAPK, or JNK. Aldo/Ang II synergistically activated RhoA/Rho kinase and VSMC migration, effects blocked by PP2, apocynin, and fasudil, inhibitors of c-Src, NADPH oxidase, and Rho kinase, respectively.Aldo/Ang II synergistically activate c-Src, an immediate signaling response, through EGFR and PDGFR, but not IGFR transactivation. This is associated with activation of redox-regulated RhoA/Rho kinase, which controls VSMC migration. Although Aldo and Ang II interact to stimulate ERK1/2, such effects are c-Src-independent. These findings indicate differential signaling in Aldo-Ang II crosstalk and highlight the importance of c-Src in redox-sensitive RhoA, but not ERK1/2 signaling. Blockade of Aldo/Ang II may be therapeutically useful in vascular remodeling associated with abnormal VSMC migration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15037537>Blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor stabilizes atherosclerotic plaques in humans by inhibiting prostaglandin E2-dependent matrix metalloproteinase activity.</a></h1><p>Clinical trials have demonstrated that agents that inhibit the angiotensin II pathway confer benefit beyond the reduction of blood pressure alone. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this effect has yet to be investigated. Recently, we have demonstrated enhanced expression of inducible cyclooxygenase (COX) and prostaglandin (PG)E2-dependent synthase (COX-2/mPGES-1) in human symptomatic plaques and provided evidence that it is associated with metalloproteinase (MMP)-induced plaque rupture. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize the effect of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist  on the inflammatory infiltration and expression of COX-2/mPGES-1 and MMPs in human carotid plaques.Seventy patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis were randomized to  (300 mg/d) or chlorthalidone (50 mg/d) for 4 months before endarterectomy. Plaques were subjected to analysis of COX-1, COX-2, mPGES-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9, angiotensin II, AT(1), AT2, and collagen content by immunocytochemistry, Western blot, and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, whereas zymography was used to detect MMP activity. Immunohistochemistry was also used to identify CD68+ macrophages, CD3+ T lymphocytes, smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and HLA-DR+ inflammatory cells. Plaques from the  group had fewer (P<0.0001) macrophages, T lymphocytes, and HLA-DR+ cells; less (P<0.0001) immunoreactivity for COX-2/mPGES-1 and MMPs; reduced (P<0.0001) gelatinolytic activity; and increased (P<0.0001) collagen content. It is worth noting that COX-2/mPGES-1 inhibition was observed after incubation in vitro with  but not with the selective AT2 blockade PD123,319.This study demonstrates that  decreases  and inhibits COX-2/mPGES-1 expression in plaque macrophages, and this effect may in turn contribute to plaque stabilization by inhibition of MMP-induced plaque rupture.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28144715>Cardioprotective effects of  in polymicrobial sepsis : The role of the p38MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway.</a></h1><p>Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response usually correlated with multi-organ failure.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of  in attenuation of cardiac depression during polymicrobial sepsis via decreased activation of the phospho-p38MAPK/nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway.A model of polymicrobial sepsis induced via cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) with 8- to 12-week-old albino mice was used. Mice were treated with i.p.  (3 mg/kg) 1 h before CLP. Using a micro-tipped transducer catheter, the following hemodynamic parameters were evaluated after CLP: heart rate, ejection fraction, left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure, LV systolic pressure, and cardiac output. Plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and cardiac troponin I (cTn-I), were measured via ELISA analysis. The degree of p38MAPK and NF-κB phosphorylation was assessed via Western blotting.Mice treated with  displayed improvement in LV function (ejection fraction: 42.4 ± 1.1% vs. 27.8 ± 3% in CLP mice). The attenuation of cardiac depression in -treated mice was associated with lower levels of MCP-1 in plasma and a reduction in the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6. Furthermore, -treated mice displayed lower expression levels of p38-MAPK and NF-κB phosphorylation. can attenuate cardiac dysfunction during polymicrobial sepsis possibly via a reduction of proinflammatory cytokines through decreased activation of the p38MAPK/NF-κB pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17602151>The effects of  and spironolactone in prevention of peritoneal fibrosis in rats.</a></h1><p>Bacterial peritonitis episodes may disturb the functional and histological integrity of the peritoneum in peritoneal dialysis patients.

Notably, the impact of unopposed angiotensin type 2 receptor stimulation and the absence of augmentation of bradykinin through inhibition of the kininase pathway may lead to differences between the effects of AT1RBs and ACEIs. ACEIs have been shown to improve endothelial dysfunction in many clinical settings.To review current evidence regarding the effects of AT1RBs on endothelial dysfunction in patients.MEDLINE and Current Contents searches, augmented by careful analyses of the bibliographies in the identified papers, were used to identify studies assessing the effects of chronic, oral use of AT1RBs on endothelial function and related inflammatory markers in patients. Animal studies and human studies using single doses or intravenous infusions were excluded.Clinical studies are available pertaining to the elderly and patients with coronary artery disease, hypertension and diabetes. The effect on endothelial dysfunction induced by postprandial lipemia has also been assessed. In general, AT1RBs improve vasomotor endothelial dysfunction and some inflammatory markers, but a few studies comparing ACEIs directly with AT1RBs suggest that AT1RBs may be inferior.

ApoE KO mice placed on a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks were divided into four groups: i) the control (HFD only), ii) the HFD +  (5 mg/kg/day), iii) the HFD +  + GW9662, a PPARγ antagonist (0.5 mg/kg/day) and iv) the HFD +  + anti-HGF neutralizing antibody (200 μg/week). The liver and epididymal adipose tissues were evaluated histologically. Serum adiponectin and HGF levels were also measured by ELISA. Fatty liver (as detected by oil-red O staining) and macrophage infiltration were markedly reduced by .  treatment also reduced macrophage infiltration into epididymal adipose tissue and hypertrophy of adipocytes. However, these effects of  were attenuated by GW9662 as well as by anti-HGF neutralizing antibody.

In clinical trials, this combination therapy proved to be superior to monotherapy in reducing office and ambulatory BP. In this review, the authors have updated the current evidence on the efficacy of the zofenopril plus hydrochlorothiazide combination in light of the results of the recent ZODIAC study on previously monotherapy-treated uncontrolled hypertensive patients with associated cardiovascular risk factors. The trial documented a similar BP control under this combination and with  plus hydrochlorothiazide, but a larger reduction of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, suggesting a potential protective effect against vascular inflammation.

Four randomized, double-blind, parallel group studies with a similar design, including 1469 hypertensive patients uncontrolled by a previous monotherapy and with ≥1 cardiovascular risk factor, compared the efficacy of a combination of a sulfhydryl ACE inhibitor (zofenopril at 30 or 60 mg) or an ARB ( at 150 or 300 mg) plus HCTZ 12.5 mg. The extent of blood pressure (BP)-lowering was assessed in the office and over 24 h. Pleiotropic features of the treatments were evaluated by studying their effect on systemic inflammation, organ damage, arterial stiffness, and metabolic biochemical parameters. Both treatments similarly reduced office and ambulatory BPs after 18-24 weeks. In the ZODIAC study a larger reduction in high sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) was observed under zofenopril (-0.52 vs. +0.97 mg/dL under , p = 0.001), suggesting a potential protective effect against the development of atherosclerosis. In the ZENITH study the rate of carotid plaque regression was significantly larger under zofenopril (32% vs. 16%; p = 0.047).

It participates in the control of hemostasis, blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, platelet and leukocyte interactions with the vessel wall, regulation of vascular tone, and of blood pressure. Many crucial vasoactive endogenous compounds are produced by the endothelial cells to control the functions of vascular smooth muscle cells and of circulating blood cells. These complex systems determine a fine equilibrium which regulates the vascular tone. Impairments in endothelium-dependent vasodilation lead to the so called endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction is then characterized by unbalanced concentrations of vasodilating and vasoconstricting factors, the most important being represented by nitric oxide (NO) and angiotensin II (AT II). High angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity leads to increased AT II generation, reduced NO levels with subsequent vasoconstriction. The net acute effect results in contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells and reduced lumen diameter. Furthermore, when increased ACE activity is chronically sustained, increase in growth, proliferation and differentiation of the vascular smooth muscle cells takes place; at the same time, a decrease in the anti-proliferative action by NO, a decrease in fibinolysis and an increase in platelets aggregation may be observed. AT II is then involved not only in the regulation of blood pressure, but also in vascular , permeability, smooth muscle cells remodelling, and oxidative stress which in turn lead to atherosclerosis and increased cardiovascular risk. Given the pivotal role exerted by AT II in contributing to alteration of endothelial function, treatment with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may be of particular interest to restore a physiological activity of endothelial cells. In this view, the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), has been shown to positively affect the endothelial function, beyond the antihypertensive action displayed by these compounds. In this review, attention has been specifically focused on an ARB, , to examine its effects on endothelial function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23639758> administration therapeutically influences circulating endothelial progenitor cell and microparticle mobilization by involvement of pro-inflammatory cytokines.</a></h1><p>Circulating microparticles (MPs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) correlate with endothelial dysfunction and contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In this context, we explored whether the angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist, , exerts a pharmacological control in the atherosclerotic process by the improvement of EPC mobilization and inhibitory effects on MP release and VEGF and SDF-1α levels in the hypertensive-hypercholesterolemic (HH) hamster model. The HH hamsters were treated with  (50mg/kg b.w/day administered by gavage) for 4 month (HHI). We analyzed MP/EPC infiltration in vascular wall before and after  administration as well as the endothelial function and expression of VEGF/SDF-1α in plasma and tissue and of molecular pathways activated by them. The results showed that treatment with  significantly increased EPC infiltration and decreased MP infiltration. The mechanisms underlying this response include the reduction/increase of a number of specific membrane receptors exposed by MPs (TF, P-Selectin, E-Selectin, PSGL-1, Rantes), respectively, by EPCs (β2-Integrins, α4β1-integrin), the augmentation of endothelium-mediated vasodilation and the reduction of protein expression of VEGF/SDF-1α followed by: (1) the diminishment of pro-inflammatory endothelial cytokines: VEGFR1, VEGFR2, CXCR4, Tie2, PIGF with role in EPC homing to sites of damaged endothelium; and (2) the increase of protein expression of COX-2, PGI2 synthase molecules with role in the improvement of arterial wall vasodilatation.

Our previous research found that carnosic acid (CA) or rosemary extract can effectively improve glucose and lipid metabolism disorder by inhibiting SREBPs.In this study, we aimed to explore the therapeutic effects of CA on the DN.The mice glomerular mesangial cells (mGMCs) were used to evaluate the anti-oxidative and anti- effects of CA under high glucose (HG) condition. Furthermore, db/db mice and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice were used to investigate the effects of CA against DN in vivo.The results showed that CA activated Nrf2, inhibited NF-κB pathway and regulated related downstream genes in mGMC under HG condition. A 14-week treatment of mice with CA reduced water uptake and urine volume, attenuated diabetes-induced albuminuria, increased urine creatinine, and subsequently improved the glomerular sclerosis and mesangial expansion in db/db mice. Similarly, a 20-week oral administration of CA improved kidney damage in STZ-induced diabetic mice. In addition, CA inhibited the expression of profibrotic factors, such as TGF-β1, fibronectin and E-cadherin. Compared to , CA exerted better glucose lowering effect, and in kidney, CA was more potent to reduce fibronectin and E-cadherin expression. In all the animal experiment, CA did not lead to abnormal damages to other tissues.These findings suggest that CA is a safe compound which exerts the protective effects on diabetes-induced kidney complications.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

Hyperglycemia induces several pathological alterations which upregulate this system, accounting for overexpression of its downstream signaling molecules, amongst which angiotensin II (Ang II) and aldosterone hold prime pathological notoriety. Although it is well known that elevated plasma levels of Ang II play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of type-II diabetic mellitus, by inducing and aggravating , it is not quite much known that it equally elevates the possibility/risk of development of diabetic complications. Also, amongst the various diabetic complications, the effects of Ang II upregulation are more widely acknowledged in studies concerning the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy; however, its role in exacerbating diabetic retinopathy has not received much attention. Ang II, indeed, plays a detrimental role in the progression of diabetic retinopathy by augmenting the principal events involved in its pathogenesis, namely oxidative stress, angiogenesis and inflammation. The utility of angiotensin receptor blockers has shown positive results in research studies and hence, might potentially provide a novel adjuvant therapy for treating this complication and preventing the associated vision-loss in diabetic patients.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Glycemia, triglyceridemia, endothelial function, nitrotyrosine, C-reactive protein, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and interleukin-6 were assayed during the tests. Subsequently, diabetics took atorvastatin 40 mg/d,  300 mg/d, both, or placebo for 1 week. The 3 tests were performed again between 5 and 7 days after the start of each treatment.

Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) have anti-inflammatory properties via inhibition of angiotensin II (Ang II)/Ang II type I receptor axis (AT1). Inhibition of the classical RAS pathway is also involved in upregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), which activates the Ang-(1-7)/Mas pathway to counteract inflammatory signaling and acts as a partner of the amino acid transporter, BAT-1, to absorb tryptophan for regulation of microbiota-gut-brain axis. In this study, we determined the effects of ARB  on stress-induced intestinal . C57BL/6J mice were subjected to 2-week intermittent restraint stress. They were orally treated during the stress with either vehicle, 3 or 10 mg/kg/day . Restraint stress resulted in colon  with higher histological damage scores, increased expression of Nox4, TLR-4 and IL1-β, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and activation of the ACE-angiotensin II-AT1 receptor axis. Stress also downregulated intestinal amino acid transporter, ACE2/BAT-1, and activity of intestinal mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K), resulting in decrease in α-defensins, changes in intestinal microbial contents, and perturbation of tryptophan metabolism with activation of the kynurenine pathway. Administration of  inhibited activation of stress-induced AT1 pathway to reduce intestinal ROS accumulation and , restored expression of ACE2/BAT-1, activity of mTOR and p70S6K, dysbiosis and tryptophan metabolism.

Molecular mechanisms underlying their formation and signaling are unclear. We investigated the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS), Rho kinase, and lipid rafts in microparticle formation and examined their functional significance in endothelial cells (ECs).Microparticle formation from angiotensin II (Ang II)-stimulated ECs and apolipoprotein E(-/-) mice was assessed by annexin V or by CD144 staining and electron microscopy. Ang II promoted microparticle formation and increased EC O(2)(-) generation and Rho kinase activity. Ang II-stimulated effects were inhibited by  (Ang II receptor type I blocker) and fasudil (Rho kinase inhibitor). Methyl-β-cyclodextrin and nystatin, which disrupt lipid rafts/caveolae, blocked microparticle release. Functional responses, assessed in microparticle-stimulated ECs, revealed increased O(2)(-) production, enhanced vascular cell adhesion molecule/platelet-EC adhesion molecule expression, and augmented macrophage adhesion. Inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor blocked the prooxidative and proinflammatory effects of microparticles. In vitro observations were confirmed in apolipoprotein E(-/-) mice, which displayed vascular  and high levels of circulating endothelial microparticles, effects that were reduced by apocynin.We demonstrated direct actions of Ang II on endothelial microparticle release, mediated through NADPH oxidase, ROS, and Rho kinase targeted to lipid rafts.

Accordingly, we examined whether inhibition of AT1R with  (IRB) can protect against the development of insulin resistance in obese Zucker rats (OZRs). IRB-treatment improved the insulin-stimulated insulin receptor (IR) phosphorylation at tyrosine (Tyr) residues 1158, 1162, 1163 (involved in activation of the IR kinase) and at Tyr972 (involved in substrate recognition). AT1R blockade also originated a dramatic increase in the phosphorylation of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta. This was accompanied by a decrease in phosphorylation of IR on serine (Ser) 994, a residue that seems to be implicated in the regulation of IR kinase in OZR. In this study, we demonstrated that Ser994 of IR is a direct substrate for TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a new member of the IKK-related kinase family. TBK1 was found to co-immunoprecipitate with the IR, in the liver of OZR supporting an in vivo association between the IR and TBK1. Interestingly, a marked increase in the association between TBK1 and the IR was found in the liver of OZR as well as in other models of insulin resistance/diabetes.

However currently clinical laboratory and histopathological tests do not provide region-specific and accurate biomarkers for early detection of kidney disease. The present study was conducted to identify sensitive biomarkers for early detection and progression of tubulo-interstitial nephropathy in aristolochic acid I-induced rats at weeks 4, 8 and 12. Biomarkers were validated using aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) rats at week 24, adenine-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD) rats and CKD patients. Compared with control rats, AAN rats showed anemia, increased serum urea and creatinine, progressive renal interstitial fibrosis, activation of nuclear factor-kappa B, and up-regulation of pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidant, and pro-fibrotic proteins at weeks 8 and 12. However, no significant difference was found at week 4. Metabolomics identified 12-ketodeoxycholic acid, taurochenodesoxycholic acid, LPC(15:0) and docosahexaenoic acid as biomarkers for early detection of tubulo-interstitial nephropathy. With prolonging aristolochic acid I exposure, LPE(20:2), cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid and LPC(17:0) were identified as biomarkers for progression from early to advanced AAN and lysoPE(22:5), indoxyl sulfate, uric acid and creatinine as biomarkers of advanced AAN.

CYP induces granulosa cell apoptosis and oxidative stress.  (IRB) is a unique ARB with a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ) agonistic activity. As PPAR-ɣ activation exerts anti-inflammatory effects and reduces ROS production, IRB may further reduce inflammatory chemokine expression and suppress apoptotic cell death. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of IRB on the development of CYP-induced ovarian damage. Rats were divided into four groups: control group, IRB group (100 mg/kg, orally), CYP group (100 mg/kg, i.p. single injection), and IRB+CYP group (IRB administered 9 days before and 6 days after CYP administration). Rats sacrificed on day 16 of experiment; estradiol (E2), FSH, and TNF-α levels were estimated in serum. Reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and caspase-3 activities, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and IL-10 levels were determined in ovarian tissues. Protein expressions of p53, caspase-3, Ki-67, and Rad-51 were estimated by immunohistochemical and Western blot techniques. CYP produced ovarian damage as indicated from the decline in serum E2; elevation in FSH; unbalance in tissue oxidative stress parameters; increase in MPO, TNF-α levels, caspase-3 activity/expression, p53, and Rad-51 expression; and decrease in IL-10 contents, without effect on Ki-67. On the other hand, IRB, significantly reduced the toxic effects of CYP as indicted from normalization of E2, FSH, oxidative stress, apoptotic, and inflammatory mediators. These data were further supported by histopathological studies. Thus, co-administration of IRB may be promising in alleviating the ovarian toxic effects of CYP.© 2015 Société Française de Pharmacologie et de Thérapeutique.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15129186>Sustained blockade of brain AT1 receptors before and after focal cerebral ischemia alleviates neurologic deficits and reduces neuronal injury, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses in the rat.</a></h1><p>In the present study, we investigate whether a long-term blockade of brain AT1 receptors in male Wistar rats before and after ischemic injury exerts neuroprotective effects and modulates apoptosis and inflammatory responses, which are associated with the post-ischemic progression of brain damage.

In a randomized, prospective crossover trial, the effect of an ACEI (fosinopril; 20 mg/d) and of an ARB (; 150 mg/d) on MMP activity was evaluated. Ten hypertensive patients with glomerulonephritis and normal or mildly reduced creatinine clearance were studied. MMP activity and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP) levels were analyzed in serum and urine: without therapy, with ACEI, with ARB, and with both agents combined. Treatment periods continued for 6 wk separated by periods of 4 wk each without therapy. Untreated patients with glomerulonephritis displayed distinctively higher serum levels of MMP-2 but much lower MMP-1/-8/-9 concentrations compared with healthy control subjects. Immunohistology of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in kidney biopsy specimen was accordingly. However, these patients excreted higher amounts of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in urine than healthy control subjects, possibly reflecting ongoing glomerular . In patients with glomerulonephritis, ACEI significantly reduced overall MMP serum activity to 25%, whereas ARB did not show any effect. Activities of MMP-1/-2/-8/-9 were also significantly inhibited by fosinopril but not by . Levels of TIMP-1/-2 remained unaffected. In conclusion, ACEI and ARB differentially regulate MMP activity, which may ultimately have consequences in certain types of MMP-dependent glomerulonephritis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20516556>HIV protease inhibitors activate the adipocyte renin angiotensin system.</a></h1><p>HIV-infected patients under antiretroviral therapy that includes HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) are prone to develop a complex metabolic syndrome including insulin resistance, lipodystrophy and hypertension. Whether hypertension and cardiovascular events could result from the adipocyte renin angiotensin system (RAS) overactivation has never been investigated.Primary human adipocytes and 3T3-F442A murine adipocytes were incubated with lopinavir or atazanavir boosted with ritonavir, with or without the angiotensin II type-1 receptor (AT1R) blockers (ARBs),  or telmisartan, and the peroxysome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) regulators, rosiglitazone and GW9662. Adipose RAS activation and adipocyte functions were evaluated.The ritonavir-boosted PIs activated the adipose RAS in human and murine adipocytes as shown by the overexpression of AT1R protein, angiotensinogen messenger RNA and the amplified effect of angiotensin II on extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activity. ARBs prevented the PI effect on RAS activation (AT1R overexpression and signalling) and adipocyte functions (dedifferentiation, insulin resistance, oxidative stress and ). Consistent with a role of PPAR-gamma signalling in PI-induced RAS activation, the PPAR-gamma agonist (rosiglitazone) normalized PI-induced AT1R overexpression and adipocyte dysfunction. Conversely, the PPAR-gamma antagonist (GW9662) induced AT1R overexpression and reduced the beneficial effect of telmisartan on PI toxicity.We report that two frequently prescribed PI combinations could activate the adipose RAS in cultured cells, in part through a PPAR-gamma-dependant signalling pathway. Our data suggest a role for the adipose RAS in the development of hypertension in HIV-infected patients under PI treatment, and point out the potential use of ARBs to decrease PI adverse effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17499227>Angiotensin II-mediated oxidative stress and  mediate the age-dependent cardiomyopathy in ACE2 null mice.</a></h1><p>The peptidase action of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) allows it to function as a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. Current pharmacotherapies for human heart failure, such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin and aldosterone receptor blockers, increase the activity of ACE2 in the heart. In this study, we investigate the mechanism for the age-dependent cardiomyopathy in ACE2 null mice.Ace2(-/y) mutant mice develop a progressive age-dependent dilated cardiomyopathy with increased oxidative stress, neutrophilic infiltration, inflammatory cytokine and collagenase levels, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and pathological hypertrophy. The angiotensin II receptor-1 (AT1) blocker, , prevented the dilated cardiomyopathy in aged Ace2(-/y) mutant mice, confirming a critical role of angiotensin II (Ang II)-mediated stimulation of AT1 receptors. Ang II activation of AT1 receptors triggers G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kgamma) and its downstream pathways. We showed that p110gamma, the catalytic subunit of PI3Kgamma, is a key mediator of NADPH oxidase activation in response to Ang II. The double mutant mice (Ace2(-/y)/p110gamma(-/-)) exhibited marked reductions in oxidative stress, neutrophilic infiltration, and pathological hypertrophy resulting in myocardial protection, suggesting that PI3Kgamma plays a critical role in Ang II-mediated cardiomyopathy.Our findings demonstrate that the age-dependent cardiomyopathy in ACE2 null mice is related to increased Ang II-mediated oxidative stress and neutrophilic infiltration via AT1 receptors. Our combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches defines a critical role of ACE2 in the suppression of Ang II-mediated heart failure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25732086>Cross-talk between angiotensin-II and toll-like receptor 4 triggers a synergetic inflammatory response in rat mesangial cells under high glucose conditions.</a></h1><p>Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) may play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN). In this study, We observed the TLR4 signal and the release of  factors after angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulation in rat mesangial cells (MCs) under high glucose conditions, this revealed the innate immune mechanism of injury by Ang II in DN. Our data showed that TLR4 and MyD88 were up-regulated significantly in high glucose and AngII-induced MCs; meanwhile, NF-κB as well as MCP-1, IL-6 were also highly expressed. In cells that were transfected with TLR4 SiRNA，the parameters were greatly inhibited; similar effects were detected in cells that were treated with . We concluded that Ang II synergized with high glucose in the release of pro-inflammatory factors mainly through the upregulation of TLR4 signaling in MCs, Cross-talk between Ang II and TLR4 contributed to the MC inflammatory injury under high glucose conditions.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, the effect of  on heart failure complicated by renal failure has not yet been elucidated. Thus the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of  on the pathophysiology of cardiorenal syndrome in a rat model. Subtotal nephrectomy (NTX) was performed in rats was using a two-step surgical procedure. Twenty-eight days after NTX, myocardial infarction (MI) was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The animals were orally administered vehicle or  (10 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) after NTX. The hearts were harvested 28 days after MI. MI with NTX model rats showed an impaired post-MI survival rate and enhanced cardiac  in comparison to MI without NTX rats. Although  treatment did not improve the survival rate, it suppressed cardiac , left ventricular function decline, cardiac fibrosis, hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes and renal fibrosis in MI with NTX rats. Moreover, increases in protein expression levels related to oxidative stress and  (NADPH oxidase 4, phospho-nuclear factor-κB and phospho-c-Jun) observed in the hearts of non-treated MI with NTX rats were attenuated by  treatment.

Angiotensin II has been demonstrated, at least in animal models, to stimulate MCP-1 expression. We investigated the effect of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonists  and losartan on MCP-1 production by freshly isolated human monocytes.  and losartan inhibited basal MCP-1 production in a dose-dependent manner. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) stimulated MCP-1 in a concentration-dependent manner, with 200 microg/ml LDL protein giving a 2-fold increase in MCP-1.  and losartan dose dependently blocked LDL-stimulated MCP-1.

However, the mechanisms of HKC are still not fully understood.Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α/γ dual agonists have the potential to be used as therapeutic agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy (DN). This study evaluated the function of Huangkui capsule (HKC), an extract from Abelmoschus manihot (L.) medic (AM), as a dual agonist for PPARα/γ and investigated its anti-DN effects in a DN rat model.ChIP and reporter gene assays were performed and the expression of PPARα/γ target genes was monitored to examine the ability of HKC to activate PPARα/γ. DN was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats via unilateral nephrectomy and intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. HKC was administered to the diabetic nephropathy rats at three different doses: high dose HKC (300mg/kg/d); middle dose HKC (175mg/kg/d); and low dose HKC (75mg/kg/d).

Following 12 weeks' treatment, we measured general status, renal morphological appearance, proteinuria, blood biochemical parameters, and glomerular morphological changes. The expression of collagen IV, TGFβ, TNFα and IL-6 in renal tissue was evaluated. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in renal tissue was also analyzed.HKC enhanced the transcriptional activity of PPARα and PPARγ in cultured cells, livers and kidneys of DN rats, and it reduced serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels and fat in livers of DN rats. Furthermore, HKC reduced the expressions of inflammatory genes in kidneys of DN rats. Strikingly, HKC reduced ER stress and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation in the liver and kidney of DN rats and subsequently improved renal injury.Our results show that HKC improved lipid metabolic disorders by activating PPARα/γ and attenuating ER stress. HKC could dose-dependently ameliorate renal  and glomerular injury in DN rats.

It is this type of drug-induced diarrhea that is the focus of this review.A summary of our findings (recent and earlier published) as well as a review of published works from other centers were conducted.There is increasing evidence that olmesartan use is associated with enteropathy in a small number of individuals who use angiotensin receptor II blockers, and that this enteropathy is characterized by severe diarrhea capable of inducing severe dehydration and, in some instances, failure of organs such as the kidney. Typical patient demographics are Caucasian individuals who are older (>50 years old) and obese or overweight prior to weight loss. Prolonged exposure to olmesartan use for 1-2 years is typical, although case reports of  and valsartan have been reported as well. Discontinuing olmesartan leads to improvement of symptoms; however, the period for healing is variable, with some patients requiring steroid therapy and even prolonged parental nutrition support. In addition, many histological features of olmesartan-associated enteropathy are also present in celiac disease, including villi shortening and lymphocyte infiltration. Other drug-associated enteropathies have also been reported with mycophenolate mofetil used in transplantation.Of the drug-associated enteropathies discussed in this review, olmesartan can generate the most severe symptoms, albeit quite rare. Therefore, with patients who present with severe diarrhea and weight loss, one should consider olmesartan-associated enteropathy. In addition, many of the features associated with olmesartan-associated enteropathy are also found in celiac disease enteropathy; as such, one should review any celiac disease diagnosis for any use of olmesartan at the time of diagnosis.© 2015 S.

Our previous studies demonstrated that administration of a subpressor dose of angiotensin (Ang) II sensitizes subsequent Ang II-elicited hypertension. The present study tested whether high-fat diet (HFD) feeding also sensitizes the Ang II-elicited hypertensive response and whether HFD-induced sensitization is mediated by an increase in renin-angiotensin system activity and inflammatory mechanisms in the brain. HFD did not increase baseline blood pressure, but enhanced the hypertensive response to Ang II compared with a normal-fat diet. The sensitization produced by the HFD was abolished by concomitant central infusions of either a tumor necrosis factor-α synthesis inhibitor, pentoxifylline, an Ang II type 1 receptor blocker, , or an inhibitor of microglial activation, minocycline. Furthermore, central pretreatment with tumor necrosis factor-α mimicked the sensitizing action of a central subpressor dose of Ang II, whereas central pentoxifylline or minocycline abolished this Ang II-induced sensitization. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of lamina terminalis tissue indicated that HFD feeding, central tumor necrosis factor-α, or a central subpressor dose of Ang II upregulated mRNA expression of several components of the renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokines, whereas inhibition of Ang II type 1 receptor and of  reversed these changes. The results suggest that HFD-induced sensitization of Ang II-elicited hypertension is mediated by upregulation of the brain renin-angiotensin system and of central proinflammatory cytokines.© 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17130503> treatment reduces biomarkers of inflammatory activity in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria: an IRMA 2 substudy.</a></h1><p>The impact of  treatment on biomarkers of low-grade , endothelial dysfunction, growth factors, and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) during the  in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Microalbuminuria (IRMA 2) study was evaluated.

The groups did not differ in initial levels of any of the inflammatory markers (placebo/ARB median(range)): hsCRP 3.3(0.2-23.4)/2.7(0.2-29.6) μg/mL; IL-1β 1.1(0.0-45.9)/1.1(0.0-7.2) pg/mL; IL-6 10(1-90)/12(1-84) pg/mL; IL-8 31(9-134)/34(5-192) pg/mL; IL-18 364(188-1343)/377(213-832) pg/mL; TGF-β 3.2(0.8-13.9)/3.6(1.3-3.8) ng/mL. Overall, there was no significant difference in hsCRP, IL-6, IL-8, and TGF-β between placebo and ARB-treated patients during the study period, and hsCRP, IL-6, IL-8, and TGF-β were relatively stable during the study period (P ≥ 0.18 in all tests for parallel curves, equal levels, and constant levels). The IL-1β level was slightly different in the two groups over time, but not significantly (P = 0.09 in test for parallel curves) and it was also relatively stable during the study period (P ≥ 0.49 in tests for equal levels and constant level). IL-18 was the only inflammatory marker which was not constant during the study period (P = 0.001 in test for constant level), but there was no significant difference between placebo and ARB-treated (P ≥ 0.51 in tests for parallel curves and equal levels).Inflammatory biomarkers were neither acutely, nor in the long-term significantly affected by the ARB .

A previous study revealed that rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD) have an enhanced hypertensive response to subsequent angiotensin II administration that is mediated at least, in part, by increased activity of brain renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokines. This study tested whether leptin mediates this HFD-induced sensitization of angiotensin II-elicited hypertension by interacting with brain renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokine mechanisms. Rats fed an HFD for 3 weeks had significant increases in white adipose tissue mass, plasma leptin levels, and mRNA expression of leptin and its receptors in the lamina terminalis and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. Central infusion of a leptin receptor antagonist during HFD feeding abolished HFD sensitization of angiotensin II-elicited hypertension. Furthermore, central infusion of leptin mimicked the sensitizing action of HFD. Concomitant central infusions of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist , the tumor necrosis factor-α synthesis inhibitor pentoxifylline, or the inhibitor of microglial activation minocycline prevented the sensitization produced by central infusion of leptin. RT-PCR analysis indicated that either HFD or leptin administration upregulated mRNA expression of several components of the renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokines in the lamina terminalis and paraventricular nucleus. The leptin antagonist and the inhibitors of angiotensin II type 1 receptor, tumor necrosis factor-α synthesis, and microglial activation all reversed the expression of these genes. The results suggest that HFD-induced sensitization of angiotensin II-elicited hypertension is mediated by leptin through upregulation of central renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokines.© 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25016365>Angiotensin receptor 1 blockade reduces secretion of  associated cytokines from cultured human carotid atheroma and vascular cells in association with reduced extracellular signal regulated kinase expression and activation.</a></h1><p>A number of studies have suggested that angiotensin II (AII) receptor type 1 (ATR1) blocking drugs (ARBs) have anti-inflammatory effects however the mechanisms responsible are poorly investigated.To determine the role of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 in ARB induced anti-inflammatory effects within human carotid atherosclerosis.Atheroma samples obtained from patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were cultured with and without ATR1 (), ERK1/2 (PD98059), AII ([Sar(1), Ile(8)]-AII) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2 (DX600) blockade.

Inhibition of ERK1/2 downregulated IL-6, IL-8 and CXCL5 in both atheroma and cell culture supernatants. AII and ACE2 blockade had no impact on cytokine or active ERK1/2 levels in the atheroma culture.Our findings suggest that ATR1 blockade downregulates atheroma tissue ERK1/2 expression leading to a reduction in cytokine production and that a non-AII agonist ATR1 signalling response may induce expression of these  associated cytokines in the atheroma.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Antihypertensive treatment, particularly blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, contributes to prevent atherosclerosis-mediated cardiovascular events. Direct comparison of different antihypertensive treatments on atherosclerosis and particularly plaque stabilization is sparse. ApoE(-/-) mice with vulnerable (2-kidney, 1-clip renovascular hypertension model) or stable (1-kidney, 1-clip renovascular hypertension model) atherosclerotic plaques were used. Mice were treated with aliskiren (renin inhibitor),  (angiotensin-receptor blocker), atenolol (beta-blocker), or amlodipine (calcium channel blocker). Atherosclerosis characteristics were assessed. Hemodynamic and hormonal parameters were measured. Aliskiren and  significantly prevented atherosclerosis progression in 2-kidney, 1-clip mice. Indeed, compared with untreated animals, plaques showed thinner fibrous cap (P<0.05); smaller lipid core (P<0.05); decreased media degeneration, layering, and macrophage content (P<0.05); and increased smooth muscle cell content (P<0.05). Interestingly, aliskiren significantly increased the smooth muscle cell compared with . Despite similar blood pressure lowering, only partial plaque stabilization was attained by atenolol and amlodipine. Amlodipine increased plaque smooth muscle cell content (P<0.05), whereas atenolol decreased plaque  (P<0.05). This divergent effect was also observed in 1-kidney, 1-clip mice.

We hypothesized that ACE2 deficiency may compromise the cardiac response to myocardial infarction (MI).In response to MI (induced by left anterior descending artery ligation), there was a persistent increase in ACE2 protein in the infarct zone in wild-type mice, whereas loss of ACE2 enhanced the susceptibility to MI, with increased mortality, infarct expansion, and adverse ventricular remodeling characterized by ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction. In ACE2-deficient hearts, elevated myocardial levels of Ang II and decreased levels of Ang 1-7 in the infarct-related zone was associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species. ACE2 deficiency leads to increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and MMP9 levels with MMP2 activation in the infarct and peri-infarct regions, as well as increased gelatinase activity leading to a disrupted extracellular matrix structure after MI. Loss of ACE2 also leads to increased neutrophilic infiltration in the infarct and peri-infarct regions, resulting in upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, interferon-gamma, interleukin-6, and the chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, as well as increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 signaling pathways. Treatment of Ace2(-)(/y)-MI mice with , an AT1 receptor blocker, reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity, infarct size, MMP activation, and myocardial , ultimately resulting in improved post-MI ventricular function.We conclude that loss of ACE2 facilitates adverse post-MI ventricular remodeling by potentiation of Ang II effects by means of the AT1 receptors, and supplementing ACE2 can be a potential therapy for ischemic heart disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17073704>Recent insights into the role of prostanoids in atherosclerotic vascular disease.</a></h1><p>Atherosclerosis is characterized by chronic  and enrichment of inflammatory cells in the vessel wall. Acute  can lead to damaged endothelium triggering the coagulation cascade and thrombus formation. Likewise, the clotting cascade may elicit an inflammatory response. The vascular endothelium regulates vascular tone, permeability, , thrombosis, and coagulation. Dysfunction of the vascular endothelium can promote atherosclerotic disease processes. Prostanoids (prostaglandins, thromboxane, and prostacyclin) have been established as inflammatory mediators in vascular endothelial function and there continues to be growing insights into their role in atherosclerotic disease. This review examines the role of prostanoids as paracrine inflammatory mediators of atherosclerotic vascular disease, highlighting the relevant physiology of eicosanoid production and endothelial dysfunction. We consider the role of prostanoids in systemic diseases associated with high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, including diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, rheumatologic disorders, and dyslipidemia. We present emerging evidence that cardio-protective and lipid lowering medications, such as  and simvastatin may exert their effects via prostanoid mediated pathways. Both serum and urinary prostanoids may be utilized as diagnostic predictors of disease; for example 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) in the serum has recently been reported as an independent predictor of symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. In addition, we discuss current recommendations on established therapeutic uses of prostanoids for atherosclerotic diseases, such as the use of PGE(1) for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease. Finally, we investigate original therapeutic modalities of various prostanoids involved in the aforementioned diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21900943>Role of brainstem thyrotropin-releasing hormone-triggered sympathetic overactivation in cardiovascular mortality in type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats.</a></h1><p>Sympathetic hyperactivity has an important role in cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-containing fibers innervate autonomic motor and premotor nuclei of the brainstem and spinal cord that regulate cardiovascular functions. We compared cardiovascular responses to application of TRH-analog in the brainstem of Wistar and T2D Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats. GK rats exhibited basal systolic hypertension (152±2 mm Hg) and had a significantly potentiated, dose-related hypertensive response to intracisternal (i.c.) injection of the TRH-analog RX77368 (10-60 ng). In GK rats only, i.c. RX77368 (30-60 ng) markedly increased heart rate (HR; +88 b.p.m.) and induced acute cardiac mortality (100%), concurrent with extreme hyperglycemia (>26 mmol l(-1)), increased plasma H(2)O(2) and 8-isoprostane, and enhanced heart expression of NADPH oxidase 4 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 mRNAs. GK rats also had elevated basal plasma epinephrine, higher adrenal gene expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine β-hydroxylase (DβH), and greater plasma catecholamine and adrenal DβH responses to i.c. TRH-analog, compared with Wistar rats. In GK rats, hexamethonium blocked i.c. RX77368-induced hypertensive and tachycardic responses, and reduced mortality by 86%, whereas phentolamine abolished the hypertensive response but enhanced tachycardia (+160 b.p.m.), and reduced mortality by 50%. The angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist  prevented i.c. RX77368-induced increases in blood pressure, HR and mortality.

Only IRB reduced serum IL-6 and hsCRP levels significantly compared with baseline (p < 0.01), whereas ENAL did not (hsCRP p < 0.02 IRB vs. ENAL, p < 0.01 IRB vs. ENAL). Platelet aggregation was only reduced by IRB (p < 0.001, ENAL p < 0.06, IRB vs. ENAL p < 0.001) while urine PGE(2) levels remained unchanged.Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) blockade reduced serum MMP-9 protein/activity to a similar extent, and only AT1 blockade reduced hsCRP, IL-6, and platelet aggregation in patients with CAD. Thus, AT1-blockade appears to exert stronger systemic anti-inflammatory and anti-aggregatory effects compared with ACE inhibition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25854990>TLR4 is a critical regulator of angiotensin II-induced vascular remodeling: the roles of extracellular SOD and NADPH oxidase.</a></h1><p>Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and angiotensin II (AngII) induce vascular remodeling through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). AngII has also been shown to increase antioxidant enzyme extracellular superoxide dismutase (ecSOD). However, the roles of TLR4 in Ang II-induced ROS production, vascular remodeling and hypertension remain unknown. Mice lacking TLR4 function showed significant inhibition of vascular remodeling in response to chronic AngII infusion, with no impact on blood pressure. The increases in ROS level and NADPH oxidase activity in response to AngII infusion were markedly blunted in TLR4-deficient mice. Similar effects were observed in wild-type (WT) mice treated with a sub-depressor dose of the AT1 receptor antagonist , which had no effects on TLR4-deficient mice. Intriguingly, the AngII infusion-induced increases in ecSOD activity and expression were rather enhanced in TLR4-deficient mice compared with WT mice, whereas the expression of the proinflammatory chemokine MCP-1 was decreased. Importantly, AngII-induced vascular remodeling was positively correlated with NADPH oxidase activity, ROS levels and MCP-1 expression levels. Notably, chronic norepinephrine infusion, which elevates blood pressure without increasing ROS production, did not induce significant vascular remodeling in WT mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that ROS elevation is required for accelerating vascular remodeling but not for hypertensive effects in this model. We demonstrated that TLR4 plays a pivotal role in regulating AngII-induced vascular ROS levels by inhibiting the expression and activity of the antioxidant enzyme ecSOD, as well as by activating NADPH oxidase, which enhances inflammation to facilitate the progression of vascular remodeling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24084214>Markers of , endothelial activation, and arterial stiffness in hypertensive heart disease and the effects of treatment: results from the SILVHIA study.</a></h1><p>We assessed the contribution of blood pressure (BP), , and endothelial activation to the development of structural vascular and cardiac changes in hypertension. Furthermore, the effects of antihypertensive therapy were studied. We studied 114 patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy and 38 matched hypertensive subjects without cardiac hypertrophy and 38 normotensive subjects. The group with hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy were randomized to treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker () or a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker (atenolol) for 48 weeks. Markers of  (high-sensitive C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, leukocyte counts), vascular function (ambulatory aortic stiffness index, arterial compliance, and pulse pressure), and endothelial activation (E-selectin, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular adhesion molecule-1) were assessed. Markers of  and arterial stiffness were lowest in the normotensive group and highest in patients with hypertensive heart disease; endothelial markers were similar between groups.  was independently related to BP. Markers of arterial stiffness were independently related to BP and to a lesser extent to left ventricular mass. Antihypertensive treatment improved arterial compliance; inflammatory and endothelial markers remained unchanged. In conclusion, markers of  and arterial stiffness are independently related to BP. Antihypertensive therapy seems to improve arterial stiffness, but effects on markers of  and endothelial activation are small.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21239640>20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid synthesis is increased in human neutrophils and platelets by angiotensin II and endothelin-1.</a></h1><p>The cytochrome P-450 arachidonic acid metabolite 20-HETE is central to the regulation of vascular tone, renal function, and blood pressure and is synthesized in the rat kidney in response to angiotensin II (ANG II) and endothelin-1 (ET-1). There are very few studies examining the cellular synthesis of 20-HETE in humans. We aimed to measure human neutrophil and platelet 20-HETE levels under basal conditions and after ANG II, ET-1, and calcium ionophore (CaI). 20-HETE was measured in human platelets and neutrophils after saline (control), CaI (2.5 μg/ml), and ANG II or ET-1 (10 nmol/l-1 μmol/l) incubations. The effect of cells, which were preincubated with the ω-hydroxylase inhibitor N-hydroxy-N'-(4-butyl-2-methylphenyl) (HET0016, 10 nM), ANG II types 1 or 2 (AT(1) or AT(2)) receptor inhibition with  (1 μmol/l) or PD-123319 (1 μmol/l), or endothelin receptor subtypes A or B (ET(A) or ET(B)) receptor inhibition with BQ-123 or BQ-778 (100 nmol/l), was studied. Neutrophil and platelet content and release of 20-HETE was significantly increased by CaI and blocked by the ω-hydroxylase inhibitor HET0016. ANG II and ET-1 significantly increased neutrophil and platelet content and release of 20-HETE. ANG II increased 20-HETE via the AT(2) receptor. ET-1 increased 20-HETE through the ET(B) receptor in platelets and both the ET(A) and ET(B) receptors in neutrophils. These studies show that human platelets and neutrophils synthesize 20-HETE in response to ANG II and ET-1. 20-HETE synthesis in both cell types was predominantly mediated via the AT(2) and ET(B) receptors. Stimulation via these receptor pathways has generally been thought to be cardioprotective and requires further studies in clinical situations associated with low-grade  or where ANG II and ET-1 are elevated to clarify the role of 20-HETE.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17069818>Angiotensin II type 1-receptor antagonism prevents type IIA secretory phospholipase A2-dependent lipid peroxidation.</a></h1><p>Accumulation and modification of low density lipoproteins (LDL) within the vessel wall represent key events in atherogenesis. Secretory phospholipase A2 type IIA (sPLA2-IIA) modulates the enzymatic process of LDL-modification and was recently identified as an independent predictor of coronary events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Angiotensin II (ANG II) type 1 (AT1)-receptor blockade reduces LDL-modification and atherosclerotic plaque formation in rodent and primate models of atherosclerosis. Therefore, we assessed whether ANG II via its AT1-receptor enhances sPLA2-IIA-dependent lipid peroxidation in vitro and in patients with CAD. Stimulation of rat aortic smooth muscle cells with ANG II (10(-7) mol/L) enhanced sPLA2-IIA protein expression, activity as well as LDL-peroxidation, determined by western blot, activity assay and malondialdehyde (MDA)-assay and diene formation, respectively, and were blunted by AT1-receptor blockade (Losartan, 10(-5) mol/L). In addition, ANG II-induced sPLA2 activity and LDL-peroxidation were abolished by the sPLA2-IIa activity inhibitor LY311727 (10(-5) mol/L). To evaluate a potential clinical implication, patients (n=18) with angiographically documented CAD were treated with the AT1-receptor blocker  (IRB; 300 mg/d) for 12 weeks. Blood samples were obtained from patients pre- and post-treatment and from healthy volunteers. SPLA2-IIA serum level and activity, circulating antibodies against oxidized LDL (oxLDL), oxLDL and MDA were determined in patients and found to be significantly increased compared to healthy volunteers. IRB therapy reduced these markers of , whereas total cholesterol, HDL- and LDL-fractions remained unchanged. ANG II may elicit pro-atherosclerotic effects via type IIA sPLA2-dependent LDL-modifications. Chronical AT1-receptor blockade reduces sPLA2-IIA level and activity and subsequently lipid peroxidation. Theses findings represent a novel anti-atherosclerotic mechanism and imply that AT1-receptor blockade elicits anti-atherosclerotic potencies even in the absence of plasma cholesterol reduction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30002098>Effects of Sacubitril/Valsartan Versus  in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease.</a></h1><p>Sacubitril/valsartan reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but its effects on kidney function and cardiac biomarkers in people with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease are unknown.The UK HARP-III trial (United Kingdom Heart and Renal Protection-III), a randomized double-blind trial, included 414 participants with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 20 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m who were randomly assigned to sacubitril/valsartan 97/103 mg twice daily versus  300 mg once daily. The primary outcome was measured GFR at 12 months using ANCOVA with adjustment for each individual's baseline measured GFR. All analyses were by intention to treat.In total, 207 participants were assigned to sacubitril/valsartan and 207 to . Baseline measured GFR was 34.0 (SE, 0.8) and 34.7 (SE, 0.8) mL/min/1.73 m, respectively. At 12 months, there was no difference in measured GFR: 29.8 (SE 0.5) among those assigned sacubitril/valsartan versus 29.9 (SE, 0.5) mL/min/1.73 m among those assigned ; difference, -0.1 (0.7) mL/min/1.73 m. Effects were similar in all prespecified subgroups. There was also no significant difference in estimated GFR at 3, 6, 9, or 12 months and no clear difference in urinary albumin:creatinine ratio between treatment arms (study average difference, -9%; 95% CI, -18 to 1). However, compared with , allocation to sacubitril/valsartan reduced study average systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 5.4 (95% CI, 3.4-7.4) and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.0-3.3) mm Hg and levels of troponin I and N terminal of prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (tertiary end points) by 16% (95% CI, 8-23) and 18% (95% CI, 11-25), respectively. The incidence of serious adverse events (29.5% versus 28.5%; rate ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.75-1.53), nonserious adverse reactions (36.7% versus 28.0%; rate ratio, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.96-1.90), and potassium ≥5.5 mmol/L (32% versus 24%, P=0.10) was not significantly different between randomized groups.Over 12 months, sacubitril/valsartan has similar effects on kidney function and albuminuria to , but it has the additional effect of lowering blood pressure and cardiac biomarkers in people with chronic kidney disease.URL: http://www.isrctn.com .

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has recently been identified as a specific Ang II-degrading enzyme but its role in vascular biology remains elusive. We hypothesized that loss of ACE2 would facilitate Ang II-mediated vascular  and peroxynitrite production. 10-week wildtype (WT, Ace2(+/y)) and ACE2 knockout (ACE2KO, Ace2(-/y)) mice received with mini-osmotic pumps with Ang II (1.5 mg.kg⁻¹.d⁻¹) or saline for 2 weeks. Aortic ACE2 protein was obviously reduced in WT mice in response to Ang II related to increases in profilin-1 protein and plasma levels of Ang II and Ang-(1-7). Loss of ACE2 resulted in greater increases in Ang II-induced mRNA expressions of inflammatory cytokines monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 without affecting tumor necrosis factor-α in aortas of ACE2KO mice. Furthermore, ACE2 deficiency led to greater increases in Ang II-mediated profilin-1 expression, NADPH oxidase activity, and superoxide and peroxynitrite production in the aortas of ACE2KO mice associated with enhanced phosphorylated levels of Akt, p70S6 kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Interestingly, daily treatment with AT1 receptor blocker  (50 mg/kg) significantly prevented Ang II-mediated aortic profilin-1 expression, , and peroxynitrite production in WT mice with enhanced ACE2 levels and the suppression of the Akt-ERK-eNOS signaling pathways. Our findings reveal that ACE2 deficiency worsens Ang II-mediated aortic  and peroxynitrite production associated with the augmentation of profilin-1 expression and the activation of the Akt-ERK-eNOS signaling, suggesting potential therapeutic approaches by enhancing ACE2 action for patients with vascular diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18239590>ACE inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade prevent fatty liver and fibrosis in obese Zucker rats.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is a common liver disease in industrialized countries, is associated with obesity, hypertension, and type-2 diabetes (metabolic syndrome). Since angiotensin II (ANG II) has been suggested to play an important role in liver  and fibrosis, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether therapy against renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may provide some beneficial effect in liver of an animal model of metabolic syndrome.For 6 months, obese Zucker rats (OZRs) were treated as follows: OZR-group, OZR + Perindopril (P) group, OZR +  (IRB) group, OZR + Amlodipine (AML) group, and lean Zucker rats (LZRs) group as a control. Livers were evaluated by immunohistochemistry techniques using corresponding antibodies.All treated groups showed a similar reduction in blood pressure compared to untreated OZR. Therapy either with IRB or P improves insulin sensitivity and reduces hepatic enzyme level with respect to untreated OZR. Conversely, AML failed to modify both parameters. Untreated OZR displayed higher hepatic ANG II levels and steatosis together with a marked increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) level compared to LZR. Following RAS inhibition either by P or IRB, a significant reduction (P < 0.01) in the immunostaining of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and TGF-beta1 compared to untreated OZR was observed.These results indicate that ANG II expression is increased in the liver of these animals with steatohepatitis. Furthermore, RAS control by either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or AT1 receptor blockade seems to provide a beneficial modulation concerning the inflammatory response to liver injury in this model. Consequently, blockade of RAS could be a new approach to prevent or to treat patients with NASH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19814728>-mediated reduction of renal and cardiac damage in insulin resistant JCR : LA-cp rats.</a></h1><p>Angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs), originally developed for antihypertensive properties, have pleiotropic effects including direct vascular actions.

Fasting glycaemic control of the JCR : LA-cp rats was marginally improved, at the expense of increased plasma insulin levels ( approximately 50%). Fasting plasma triglycerides were marginally reduced ( approximately 25%), while cholesterol concentrations were unchanged. Elevated concentrations of adiponectin, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were reduced along with severity of glomerular sclerosis. Macrovascular dysfunction (aortic hypercontractile response to noradrenergic stimulus and reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation) was improved and frequency of ischaemic myocardial lesions reduced (62%). reduces markers of  and prothombotic status, improves macrovascular function and reduces glomerular sclerosis and myocardial lesions in a model of the metabolic syndrome.

Understanding these would offer novel pharmaceutical approaches to protection against cardiovascular disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20213806>Involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in the development of vascular damage in a rat model of arthritis: effect of angiotensin receptor blockers.</a></h1><p>To explore the involvement of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the development of vascular damage in adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) in rats.Angiotensin II (Ang II; 0.25 or 1.0 mg/kg/day) was infused in control rats and rats with AIA for 21 days, and the impact of systemic  on Ang II-induced hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular hypertrophy was evaluated. Expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the aortas of rats with AIA were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot analyses. Losartan (3 mg/kg/day) or  (5 mg/kg/day), both of which are AT(1)R blockers, was administered orally to rats with AIA for 21 days. In situ superoxide production in aortas was assessed according to the fluorogenic oxidation of dihydroethidium to ethidium. The expression and activity of NAD(P)H oxidases in aortas were examined by real-time PCR analysis and lucigenin chemiluminescence assay. Endothelial function in rats with AIA treated in vivo or ex vivo with AT(1)R blockers was also determined.The Ang II-induced hypertensive response, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular hypertrophy were exacerbated in rats with AIA. Expression of AT(1)R and ACE was increased in the aortas of rats with AIA. Both losartan and  decreased the levels of superoxide and the expression and activity NAD(P)H oxidases in the aortas of rats with AIA. The endothelial dysfunction in AIA was improved by the in vivo or ex vivo treatment with AT(1)R blockers.The locally activated RAS is involved in the increased vascular oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in AIA.

Renal denervation (RD) has been shown to improve cardiac function in HF, but the protective mechanisms remain unclear. The present study tested the hypothesis that RD ameliorates isoproterenol- (ISO-) induced HF through regulation of brain RAS and PICs. Chronic ISO infusion resulted in remarked decrease in blood pressure (BP) and increase in heart rate and cardiac dysfunction, which was accompanied by increased BP variability and decreased baroreflex sensitivity and HR variability. Most of these adverse effects of ISO on cardiac and autonomic function were reversed by RD. Furthermore, ISO upregulated mRNA and protein expressions of several components of the RAS and PICs in the lamina terminalis and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, two forebrain nuclei involved in cardiovascular regulations. RD significantly inhibited the upregulation of these genes. Either intracerebroventricular AT1-R antagonist, , or TNF- inhibitor, etanercept, mimicked the beneficial actions of RD in the ISO-induced HF. The results suggest that the RD restores autonomic balance and ameliorates ISO-induced HF and that the downregulated RAS and PICs in the brain contribute to these beneficial effects of RD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797786>Suppressive effects of type I angiotensin receptor antagonists, candesartan and  on allergic asthma.</a></h1><p>The effects of candesartan and , antagonists of the type I angiotensin II receptor, were investigated on allergic asthma.
