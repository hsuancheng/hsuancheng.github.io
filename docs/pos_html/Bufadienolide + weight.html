<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25841205> fate of cardiac glycosides and flavonoids upon fermentation of aqueous sea squill (Drimia maritima L.) extracts.</a></h2><p>Sea squill (Drimia maritima L.) extracts have been used for centuries for the medical treatment of heart diseases. A procedure for the preparation of Drimia extracts applied for such purposes comprising a fermentation step is described in the German Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia (GHP). However, little is known about the secondary metabolite profile of such extracts and the fate of these components upon processing and storage. Thus, in the present study sea squill extracts were monitored during fermentation and storage by HPLC-DAD-MS(n) and GC-MS to characterise and quantitate individual cardiac glycosides and phenolic compounds. For this purpose, a previously established HPLC method for the separation and quantitation of pharmacologically relevant cardiac glycosides (bufadienolides) was validated. Within 12 months of storage, total  contents decreased by about 50%, which was attributed to microbial and plant enzyme activities. The metabolisation and degradation rates of individual  glycosides significantly differed, which was attributed to differing structures of the aglycones. Further degradation of  aglycones was also observed. Besides reactions well known from human  studies, dehydration of individual compounds was monitored. Quantitatively predominating flavonoids were also metabolised throughout the fermentation process. The present study provides valuable information about the profile and stability of individual cardiac glycosides and phenolic compounds in fermented Drimia extracts prepared for medical applications, and expands the knowledge of cardiac glycoside conversion upon microbial fermentation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To test whether -like substances may circulate in human blood, we used antibodies from rabbits against the  proscillaridin A to measure the concentration of cross-reacting material in human plasma with an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IgG had an apparent affinity of 2 x 10(-9) mol/L for proscillaridin A. It was specific for bufadienolides and did not cross-react with cardenolides or several steroid hormones. Extraction of human plasma with ethanol and fractionation of this extract over a high-performance liquid chromatographic reverse-phase C18 column with a propanol/isopropanol gradient resulted in the separation of three peaks of increasing hydrophobicity (ED1, ED2, ED3) that inhibited the sodium pump of human red blood cells and cross-reacted with proscillaridin A antibodies. The concentration of the proscillaridin A immunoreactivity ED1 in normotensive subjects had a geometric mean of 0.1 nmol/L, with a dispersion factor of 8.77. ED1 correlated positively in a group of 60 normotensive subjects, 22 patients with hypertension, and 19 patients with chronic renal failure with mean arterial blood pressure (log ED1 [nmol/L] = 0.013 x mm Hg-2.17, r = .25, P < .05), systolic pressure (log ED1 [nmol/L] = 0.010 x mm Hg-2.23, r = .32, P < .01), and pulse pressure (log ED1 [nmol/L] = 0.019 x mm Hg-1.80, r = .38, P < .0001). There was no correlation with other parameters of the donors. We conclude that several substances cross-reacting with proscillaridin A antibodies and inhibiting the sodium pump of human red blood cells circulate in human blood. The level of one of these substances (ED1) correlates with mean arterial and pulse pressures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26132852>Quantification of Bufadienolides in Bryophyllum pinnatum Leaves and Manufactured Products by UHPLC-ESIMS/MS.</a></h2><p>A quantitative assay for determination of the main bufadienolides bersaldegenin-1-acetate (1), bersaldegenin-3-acetate (2), bryophyllin A (3), and bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate (4) in Bryophyllum pinnatum leaves and manufactured products was developed and validated. The assay involved extraction by pressurised liquid extraction, followed by quantification by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy. The ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy method was applied to various batches of leaves harvested on several dates from plants grown at two locations (Brazil and Germany). In addition, press juices prepared from plants cultivated in Germany and Brazil were analysed. The total  content ranged from 16.28 to 40.50 mg/100 g dry weight in leaves from plants grown in Brazil. The total content of these four bufadienolides was significantly lower in plants cultivated in Germany (3.78-12.49 mg/100 g dry weight, resp.). The total amounts of bufadienolides were 0.091-0.163 mg/100 mL and 0.89-1.16 mg/100 mL in press juices obtained from plants cultivated in Germany and Brazil, respectively. When analysing single leaves from individual plants, the content of bufadienolides was markedly higher in young leaves. For comparative purposes, the content of these bufadienolides was also determined in Bryophyllum daigremontianum and Bryophyllum tubiflorum. Bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate (4) was predominant in the leaves of B. daigremontianum and in the stems of B. tubiflorum, while the leaves of B. tubiflorum contained very low amounts of 1-4.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22378033>Monoclonal antibody against marinobufagenin reverses cardiac fibrosis in rats with chronic renal failure.</a></h2><p>Cardiotonic steroids (CTS) are implicated in pathophysiology of uremic cardiomyopathy. In the present study, we tested whether a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the  CTS, marinobufagenin (MBG), alleviates cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in partially nephrectomized (PNx) rats.In PNx rats, we compared the effects of 3E9 anti-MBG mAb and of Digibind, an affinity-purified digoxin antibody, on blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis following 4 weeks after the surgery.In PNx rats, a fourfold elevation in plasma MBG levels was associated with hypertension, increased cardiac levels of carbonylated protein, cardiac hypertrophy, a reduction in cardiac expression of a nuclear transcription factor which is a negative regulator of collagen synthesis, Friend leukemia integration-1 (Fli-1), and an increase in the levels of collagen-1. A single intraperitoneal administration of 3E9 mAb to PNx rats reduced blood pressure by 59 mm Hg for 7 days and produced a significant reduction in cardiac  and cardiac levels of oxidative stress, an increase in the expression of Fli-1, and a reduction in cardiac fibrosis. The effects of Digibind were similar to those of 3E9 mAb, but were less pronounced.In experimental chronic renal failure, elevated levels of MBG contribute to hypertension and induce cardiac fibrosis via suppression of Fli-1, representing a potential target for therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26273290>First serine protease inhibitor isolated from Rhinella schneideri poison.</a></h2><p>Toad secretions are a source of molecules with potential biotechnological application on a wide spectrum of diseases. Toads from the Rhinella family have two kinds of poisonous glands, namely granular and mucous glands. Rhinella schneideri toads produce granular secretions that comprise a great number of molecules, including serine proteases inhibitors. Serine proteases, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase, are enzymes that have a serine amino acid into its catalytic site and can be found in a large number of vertebrate species and pathogenic microorganisms. Therefore, the present work aims to purify a serine protease inhibitor from Rhinella schneideri granular secretions.This study presents the protocol used to purify a serine protease inhibitor from the Rhinella schneideri poison. The granular secretion was submitted to dialysis in order to separate the low molecular weight compounds, which were submitted to a reversed phase-fast protein liquid chromatography fractionation step in a C2C18 column. The major fractions were tested over trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase through colorimetric assay. The inhibition tests were performed with the enzyme in absence (positive control) and presence of fractions, denatured enzyme (negative control) and the respective chromogenic substrate. Rs20 was the compound with the major inhibitory activity over chymotrypsin, inducing a delay in the formation of the chromogenic enzymatic product. The structure characterization of Rs20 was performed by high resolution electronspray ionization-mass spectrometry (HRESI-MS) and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). HRESI showed an intense signal suggesting the presence of  with less than 10 ppm error. In addition, it was observed a low intense signal at m/z 399 that could be lithocholic acid, a biosynthetic precursor of . Finally, GC-MS analysis applying NIST library identification reinforced this hypothesis.The current study have isolated and partially characterized the function and structure of the first  with inhibitory action over chymotrypsin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9632685>A specific binding protein for cardiac glycosides exists in bovine serum.</a></h2><p>Searching for a binding protein in blood, which may be involved in the specific transport of cardiac glycosides to their receptor sites on the sodium pump, we isolated a cardiac glycoside-binding protein (CGBG) of 26 kDa from the globulin fraction of bovine serum by affinity chromatography and on a ouabain-Sepharose 4B column by a purification factor of 5000. The cardiac glycoside-binding globulin was labeled specifically and covalently by the protein-reactive digoxigenin derivative HDMA (N-hydroxysuccimidyldigoxigenin-3-O-methylcarbonyl-epsilon-+ ++aminocapro ate). Even very high concentrations of other steroids, such as estrogen, testosterone, progesterone, and cortisone, did not prevent HDMA-labeling (at 5 and 100 nM) of CGBG, but the cardenolides ouabain and digoxin or the  proscillaridin A did so. CGBG is a homodimer of two 26-kDa subunits forming disulfide bonds, since HDMA labeling of a protein of 53 kDa was observed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis when beta-mercaptoethanol was absent during SDS denaturation. The N-terminal amino acid sequence K-D-V-Y-R-A-P-D-G-T-Q-S-A showed no sequence similarity with proteins recorded in gene and protein sequence data banks. A 90-kDa cytosolic CGBG exists in bovine kidneys and reacts with antibodies against CGBG. Binding of ouabain to the cardiac glycoside-binding globulin was monitored by quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Such studies reveal two negatively cooperative ouabain binding sites with Kd' of 1.52 nM and Kd' = 75 nM and with an interaction factor of 50 using a Koshland-Némethy-Filmer model. The demonstration of a cardiac glycoside-binding globulin in plasma is consistent with the recent finding of endogenous cardiac glycosides in mammals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12151076>Analysis of proprietary Chinese medicines for the presence of toxic ingredients by LC/MS/MS.</a></h2><p>This paper presents an LC/MS/MS approach for simultaneous qualitative and quantitative analysis of proprietary Chinese medicine products for the presence of toxic ingredient compounds. The target compounds include three C(19)-diterpenoid alkaloids, two quinolizidine alkaloids, two indole alkaloids and four  steroids. They were recognized as active compounds of several toxic/potent herbal materials commonly used in the preparation of some proprietary medicine products. These toxic/potent herbal materials include Radix Aconiti Lateralis, Radix Sophorae Tonkinensis, Semen Strychni and Venenum Bufonis. In the analysis, the LC/MS/MS system was set to record the MS spectra and respective multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) signals for different target compounds after they were separated and eluted from the column. The MS spectra were used for the qualitative analysis whereas the MRM signals for the quantitative analysis. In this study, totally 12 proprietary medicine products were tested and found to contain some of the target compounds at different levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25175164>Gamabufotalin, a  compound from toad venom, suppresses COX-2 expression through targeting IKKβ/NF-κB signaling pathway in lung cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Gamabufotalin (CS-6), a major  of Chansu, has been used for cancer therapy due to its desirable metabolic stability and less adverse effect. However, the underlying mechanism of CS-6 involved in anti-tumor activity remains poorly understood.The biological functions of gamabufotalin (CS-6) were investigated by migration, colony formation and apoptosis assays in NSCLC cells. The nuclear localization and interaction between transcriptional co-activator p300 and NF-κB p50/p65 and their binding to COX-2 promoter were analyzed after treatment with CS-6. Molecular docking study was used to simulate the interaction of CS-6 with IKKβ. The in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of CS-6 was also analyzed in xenografts nude mice. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression level.Gamabufotalin (CS-6) strongly suppressed COX-2 expression by inhibiting the phosphorylation of IKKβ via targeting the ATP-binding site, thereby abrogating NF-κB binding and p300 recruitment to COX-2 promoter. In addition, CS-6 induced apoptosis by activating the cytochrome c and caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. Moreover, CS-6 markedly down-regulated the protein levels of COX-2 and phosphorylated p65 NF-κB in tumor tissues of the xenograft mice, and inhibited tumor  and size.Our study provides pharmacological evidence that CS-6 exhibits potential use in the treatment of COX-2-mediated diseases such as lung cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30150435>Bufalin Enhances Immune Responses in Leukemic Mice Through Enhancing Phagocytosis of Macrophage .</a></h2><p>Bufalin,  present in Chan Su, has been shown to induce cancer cell apoptosis in many human cancer cells, including human leukemia cells, but its effects on immune responses are unknown.This study investigated whether bufalin affected immune responses of mice with WEHI-3 cell-generated leukemia in vivo. BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with WEHI-3 cells to develop leukemia and then were treated with oral treatment with bufalin at different doses (0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. At the end of treatment, all mice were weighted and blood was collected; liver and spleen tissues were collected for cell marker, phagocytosis, natural killer (NK) cell activity and T- and B-cell proliferation measurements by using flow cytometric assays.When compared with the leukemia control group, bufalin increased the body weight, but reduced liver and spleen weights, and reduced CD3, CD16 and Mac-3 cell markers at 0.4 mg/kg treatment and increased CD11b marker at 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg treatment. Furthermore, bufalin at 0.4 mg/kg increased phagocytosis by macrophages isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and at 0.1 mg/kg by those from the peritoneal cavity. Bufalin (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg) increased NK cell cytotoxic activity at effector:target ratio of 50:1. Bufalin increased B-cell proliferation at 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg treatment but only increased T-cell proliferation at 0.1 mg/kg. Bufalin increased glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase level at all dose treatments, increased glutamic pyruvic transaminase level only at 0.1 mg/kg treatment, but reduced the level of lactate dehydrogenase at all dose levels in mice with WEHI-3 cell-induced leukemia in vivo.Bufalin increased immune responses by enhancing phagocytosis in mice with leukemia mice.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Firstly, we tried to identify small molecules and peptides in Bufonis Venenum using pre-fractionation chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry. The database search of the small molecules and peptides of Bufonis Venenum revealed that the dried venom consisted of free/conjugated-type bufadienolides and peptides with a mass range of 0.4-2 kDa. Secondly, we used partial least squares (PLS) multivariate statistical analysis to screen bufadienolides markers (VIP > 1.5) responsible for the anti-tumor cell activity of Bufonis Venenum, including 21 identified bufadienolides and 7 unknown compounds. It is noticeable that these  markers could not be recognized by traditional HPLC-UV based spectrum-effect relationship analysis (correlation coefficient ranging from -0.24 to 0.40). Finally, we proposed a  coefficient-based corrected total contents of 9 bufadienolides as a quality evaluation indicator, which had good correlation with inhibitory effects on tumor cells of commercial Bufonis Venenum. The correlation coefficient increased from 0.4 to 0.6. Thus, our pre-fractionation chromatography and mass spectrometry strategy had significant advancement over the traditional spectrum-effect relationship method for chemical marker identification. These results could be crucial and helpful in the development of a quality evaluation method that could reflect the pharmacological activity of Bufonis Venenum.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3439945>The toxicity to cattle and  content of six Bryophyllum species.</a></h2><p>Cardiac glycoside poisoning was produced in calves given (in descending order of toxicity) flower heads of the hybrid Bryophyllum (Kalanchoe) daigremontianum x B. tubiflorum, of B. pinnatum, of B. tubiflorum (from previous work), whole plant of B. fedtschenkoi, flower heads of B. daigremontianum and whole plant of B. proliferum. For each plant (except B. tubiflorum), 2 calves were each given a single dose of 20 g wet  per kg bodyweight. By using high performance liquid chromatography, the bufadienolides (cardiac glycosides) bryotoxin A, B and C were detected and assayed in the flower heads and leaf plus stem of B. tubiflorum and in the roots of B. tubiflorum, the hybrid and B. pinnatum. Only bryotoxins B and C were detected and assayed in the flower heads and leaf plus stem of the hybrid, B. daigremontianum and B. pinnatum. No bryotoxins were detected in B. fedtschenkoi. Bryotoxin A and a mixture of bryotoxins B and C from B. tubiflorum flowers were used as standards in the chromatographic assay. Comparing the results of the calf toxicity experiment with the amounts of  measured in the plants suggests that bryotoxins A, B and C probably account for the observed disease, but that B. pinnatum and B. fedtschenkoi contain at least one other cardiac glycoside.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9515560>Bovine adrenals and hypothalamus are a major source of proscillaridin A- and ouabain-immunoreactivities.</a></h2><p>Besides an isomer of the cardenolide ouabain, a material with a similar HPLC retention time as ouabain but cross-reactivating with antibodies against the  proscillaridin A and inhibiting the sodium pump is known to circulate in human blood plasma (B. SICH et al., Hypertension 27, 1073-1078 (1996).). The concentrations of both substances are known to correlate with the blood pressure. It was the intention of this work to localize tissues that contain the highest concentrations of the proscillaridin A immunoreactive material, to correlate its concentration with that of ouabain and to get information whether the concentration of this material simply reflects the number of sodium pumps of the tissue extracted. Specific antibodies for each cardiotonic steroid were used to test the tissue concentration. This report shows that in bovine tissues the distribution pattern of proscillaridin A and ouabain immunoreactivities are similar and that hypothalamus and adrenals show the highest concentrations. The cross-reactive material did not reflect the number of sodium pumps per g of wet  tissue as measured by [3H]ouabain binding. Therefore, it is unlikely that the tissue concentrations in both immunoreactivities reflects the tissue capacity of sodium pumps labeled with cardiotonic steroids via the blood plasma. The study rather favors the concept that two different types of inhibitors of the sodium pump exist within both tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9422732>Bovine adrenals contain, in addition to ouabain, a second inhibitor of the sodium pump.</a></h2><p>In the search for endogenous cardiac glycosides, two different inhibitors of the sodium pump have been isolated from bovine adrenals. Inhibitor A with a molecular mass of 600 Da and a UV maximum at 250 nm was purified from 16 kg of bovine adrenals. The pure substance (<1 ng) inhibited the sodium pump of human red blood cells with an affinity similar to that of ouabain, yet it cross-reacted with antibodies against the  proscillaridin A but not against the cardenolide ouabain. Inhibitor A was slightly more hydrophilic than ouabain on RP-C18 high pressure liquid chromatography. Hence, it showed properties similar to the proscillaridin A immunoreactivity (Sich, B., Kirch, U., Tepel, M., Zideck, W., and Schoner, W. (1996) Hypertension 27, 1073-1078) that increased in humans with systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure. Inhibitor B of the sodium pump with a molecular mass of 584 Da was purified 10(6)-fold from 20 kg of bovine adrenals. It cross-reacted with antibodies against ouabain but not with antibodies against proscillaridin A and inhibited the sodium pump of human and rat red blood cells with the same affinity as ouabain. All other properties, such as the retention time in a C18-reversed phase chromatography, molecular mass determination by electrospray mass spectrometry and fragmentation pattern, and UV and 1H NMR spectroscopic data, were identical to ouabain. Hence, sodium pump inhibitor B from bovine adrenals is the cardenolide ouabain.</p></html>
