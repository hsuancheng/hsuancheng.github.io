The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of crizotinib in patients with advanced ALK gene-positive or recurrent NSCLC.Three methods were used to screen patients with advanced or recurrent NSCLC harboring ALK gene fusion/translocation. The patients with ALK positive tested by flourescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was given orally crizotinib, 250 mg, bid. The objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and safety were evaluated.A total of 226 patients were screened, 39 of whom had ALK fusion or translocation, and 37 were enrolled in the study. 35 patients were evaluated for objective response, ORR was 70.3%, and disease control rate (DCR) was 94.6%, and median PFS was 11.8 mon. The main adverse reactions were elevated transaminase (Grade 1, 91.7%), elevated transaminases (Grade 2, 23.4%), nausea (Grade 1, 75.6%), anemia (Grade 1-2, 62.3%), visual impairment (Grade 1, 21.8%),  loss (Grade 1, 31.4%), pneumonia (Grade 2, 3.5%).Crizotinib can be used for the treatment of advanced NSCLC with ALK fusion/translocation. It is highly effective and well tolerated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176994>Two-Week Aflibercept or Erlotinib Administration Does Not Induce Changes in Intestinal Morphology in Male Sprague-Dawley Rats But Aflibercept Affects Serum and Urine Metabolic Profiles.</a></h1><p>Gastrointestinal toxicity is a frequently observed adverse event during cancer treatment with traditional chemotherapeutics. Currently, traditional chemotherapeutics are often combined with targeted biologic agents. These biologics, however, possess a distinct toxicity profile, and they may also exacerbate the adverse effects of traditional chemotherapeutics. In this study, we aimed to characterize the gastrointestinal and metabolic changes after a 2-week treatment period with aflibercept, an antiangiogenic VEGFR decoy, and with erlotinib, a -kinase inhibitor. Male rats were treated either with aflibercept or erlotinib for 2 weeks. During the 2-week treatment period, the animals in the aflibercept group received two subcutaneous doses of 25 mg/kg aflibercept. The erlotinib group got 10 mg/kg of erlotinib by oral gavage every other day. The control groups were treated similarly but received either saline injections or oral gavage of water. Intestinal toxicity was assessed by measuring intestinal permeability and by histological analyses of intestinal tissues. Metabolic changes were measured with H nuclear magnetic resonance in serum and urine. Neither aflibercept nor erlotinib induced changes in intestinal permeability or intestinal tissue morphology. However, aflibercept treatment resulted in stunted  gain and altered choline, amino acid, and lipid metabolism. Two-week treatment with aflibercept or erlotinib alone does not induce observable changes in gastrointestinal morphology and function. However, observed aflibercept-treatment related metabolic changes suggest alterations in intestinal microbiota, nutrient intake, and adipose tissue function. The metabolic changes are also interesting in respect to the systemic effects of aflibercept and their possible associations with adverse events caused by aflibercept administration.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

To assess the genes related to angiogenesis in placental biopsies of pregnancies complicated by IUGR that could be aberrantly methylated and adversely affect placental angiogenesis.  The methylation profiles of soluble fms-like  kinase-1 (sFLT-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the placental growth factor (PIGF) were evaluated using Illumina MiSeq™ System in placental biopsies from term IUGR pregnancies without preeclampsia (  =  18) and healthy controls (  =  17). DNA was isolated from samples of tissue collected from the fetal side of the placenta. In the targeted regions, we have identified 30, 24, and 29 CpG islands (CpGi) within sFLT-1, VEGF and PIGF genes, respectively. CpGi which are most methylated in the promoter regions of three genes were selected for the study from the database http://www.ensembl.org .  IUGR fetuses had significantly lower placental and fetal birth  than controls. The promoter of sFLT-1 at three CpGi and VEGF at six CpGi were the regions with significant methylation differences between IUGR and control placentas. sFLT-1 was hypermethylated at 265 and 352 CpGi; however, hypermethylation was lower in IUGR group compared to control group at this position. sFLT-1 was hypomethylated at 456 CpGi in IUGR group and hypermethylated at the same region in control group. VEGF was hypomethylated at 668, 703, and 710 CpGi in control and IUGR groups; however, hypomethylation at these positions was significantly higher in control group compared to IUGR. 776, 845, and 863 CpGi of VEGF promoter were significantly hypermethylated in IUGR group whereas hypomethylated in control group. The methylation profile of PIGF did not differ between the groups. After adjustment for the factors known to affect fetal birth , DNA methylation of VEGF 668 CpGi had a significant negative association with fetal birth  in the control and the IUGR group and a positive association with IUGR pregnancies.  Our results do not support the hypothesis that altered DNA methylation in the placental angiogenic genes is a major mechanism generally involved in IUGR. Only a specific region (at 668 CpGi) corresponding to the promoter of VEGF may serve as an epigenetic marker of IUGR and may be involved in the mechanism of IUGR. Large sample-sized studies are needed to understand the effects of DNA methylation on placental gene function and how they might influence fetal growth.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875909>Molecular Mechanisms of Hypothalamic Insulin Resistance.</a></h1><p>Insulin exists in the central nervous system, where it executes two important functions in the hypothalamus: the suppression of food intake and the improvement of glucose metabolism. Recent studies have shown that both are exerted robustly in rodents and humans. If intact, these functions exert beneficial effects on obesity and diabetes, respectively. Disruption of both occurs due to a condition known as hypothalamic insulin resistance, which is caused by obesity and the overconsumption of saturated fat. An enormous volume of literature addresses the molecular mechanisms of hypothalamic insulin resistance. IKKβ and JNK are major players in the inflammation pathway, which is activated by saturated fatty acids that induce hypothalamic insulin resistance. Two major  phosphatases, PTP-1B and TCPTP, are upregulated in chronic overeating. They dephosphorylate the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate proteins, resulting in hypothalamic insulin resistance. Prolonged hyperinsulinemia with excessive nutrition activates the mTOR/S6 kinase pathway, thereby enhancing IRS-1 serine phosphorylation to induce hypothalamic insulin resistance. Other mechanisms associated with this condition include hypothalamic gliosis and disturbed insulin transport into the central nervous system. Unveiling the precise molecular mechanisms involved in hypothalamic insulin resistance is important for developing new ways of treating obesity and type 2 diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566019>Epigenome- and Transcriptome-wide Changes in Muscle Stem Cells from Low Birth  Men.</a></h1><p>: Being born with low birth  (LBW) is a risk factor for muscle insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D), which may be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms programmed by the intrauterine environment. Epigenetic mechanisms exert their prime effects in developing cells. We hypothesized that muscle insulin resistance in LBW subjects may be due to early differential epigenomic and transcriptomic alterations in their immature muscle progenitor cells. : Muscle progenitor cells were obtained from 23 healthy young adult men born at term with LBW, and 15 BMI-matched normal birth  (NBW) controls. The cells were subsequently cultured and differentiated into myotubes. DNA and RNA were harvested before and after differentiation for genome-wide DNA methylation and RNA expression measurements. After correcting for multiple comparisons (q ≤ 0.05), 56 CpG sites were found to be significantly, differentially methylated in myoblasts from LBW compared with NBW men, of which the top five gene-annotated CpG sites () previously have been associated to regulation of cholesterol, fatty acid and glucose metabolism and muscle development or hypertrophy. LBW men displayed markedly decreased myotube gene expression levels of the AMPK-repressing  kinase gene  and the histone deacetylase gene . Silencing of  and  was associated with impaired myotube formation, which for  reduced muscle glucose uptake. : The data provides evidence of impaired muscle development predisposing LBW individuals to T2D is linked to and potentially caused by distinct DNA methylation and transcriptional changes including down regulation of  and  in their immature myoblast stem cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30782595>A Comprehensive LC-QTOF-MS Metabolic Phenotyping Strategy: Application to Alkaptonuria.</a></h1><p>Identification of unknown chemical entities is a major challenge in metabolomics. To address this challenge, we developed a comprehensive targeted profiling strategy, combining 3 complementary liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) techniques and in-house accurate mass retention time (AMRT) databases established from commercial standards. This strategy was used to evaluate the effect of nitisinone on the urinary metabolome of patients and mice with alkaptonuria (AKU). Because hypertyrosinemia is a known consequence of nitisinone therapy, we investigated the wider metabolic consequences beyond hypertyrosinemia.A total of 619 standards (molecular , 45-1354 Da) covering a range of primary metabolic pathways were analyzed using 3 liquid chromatography methods-2 reversed phase and 1 normal phase-coupled to QTOF-MS. Separate AMRT databases were generated for the 3 methods, comprising chemical name, formula, theoretical accurate mass, and measured retention time. Databases were used to identify chemical entities acquired from nontargeted analysis of AKU urine: match window theoretical accurate mass ±10 ppm and retention time ±0.3 min.Application of the AMRT databases to data acquired from analysis of urine from 25 patients with AKU (pretreatment and after 3, 12, and 24 months on nitisinone) and 18   mice (pretreatment and after 1 week on nitisinone) revealed 31 previously unreported statistically significant changes in metabolite patterns and abundance, indicating alterations to , tryptophan, and purine metabolism after nitisinone administration.The comprehensive targeted profiling strategy described here has the potential of enabling discovery of novel pathways associated with pathogenesis and management of AKU.© 2019 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30695994> Extract Inhibits α-MSH-Induced Melanogenesis in B16F10 Cells via Down-Regulation of CREB Signaling Pathway.</a></h1><p> (L.) Areschoug () is a species of littoral brown algae of the class Phaeophyceae. Only a few studies on the apoptotic, antiviral, and antioxidant properties of  have been reported, and its inhibitory effect on melanin synthesis has not been studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-melanogenic effect of  extract on α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH)-induced B16F10 melanocytes and its mechanism of action.  was extracted using 80% ethanol (LDE) and then fractioned between ethyl acetate (LDE-EA) and water (LDE-A). Our data demonstrated that LDE-EA significantly inhibited melanin level and cellular tyrosinase activity in α-MSH-stimulated B16 cells. In addition, the expression of genes associated with melanin synthesis, such as microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (), tyrosinase (), tyrosinase-related protein-1 (), dopachrome tautomerase (), and melanocortin 1 receptor () was down-regulated by LDE-EA treatment. Moreover, LDE-EA decreased p-CREB levels, which suggests that the inhibition of the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathways may be involved in the anti-melanogenic effect of LDE-EA. Thus, this study revealed that LDE-EA is an effective inhibitor of hyperpigmentation through inhibition of CREB pathways and may be considered as a potential therapeutic agent for hyperpigmentation disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867699>VEGF and sFLT-1 in serum of PIH patients and effects on the foetus.</a></h1><p>The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and soluble fms-like  kinase-1 (sFLT-1) in the serum of patients with pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) syndrome and its effects on the foetus was explored. A total of 105 cases of PIH pregnant women admitted to The First People's Hospital of Changzhou from March 2015 to February 2018 were divided into 3 groups according to the severity of the patients condition. Group A (n=35) was hypertension complicating pregnancy, group B (n=46) was mild preeclampsia and group C (n=24) was severe preeclampsia. In addition, 35 healthy pregnant women were selected as the control group. VEGF and sFLT-1 levels in serum were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, and the correlations between levels of VEGF and sFLT-1, neonatal  and Apgar score were analyzed. Compared with group A, the level of serum VEGF was lower, while the level of sFLT-1 was higher in groups B and C (P<0.05). Compared with group B, the serum VEGF level in group C decreased significantly (P<0.05), while the serum level of sFLT-1 increased significantly (P<0.05). Compared with group A, neonatal  and Apgar score in group C was significantly lower (P<0.05). There was a positive correlation between the serum VEGF level and neonatal  and Apgar score (r=0.435, P<0.001. r=0.357, P<0.001). There was a negative correlation between the serum sFLT-1 level and neonatal  and Apgar score (r=-0.351, P<0.001. r=-0.422, P<0.001). Therefore, we concluded that VEGF and sFlt-1 may be involved in the occurrence and development of PIH. The decrease of serum VEGF level and the increase of sFlt-1 level may be related to the inhibited fetal growth and development, which is of great significance in the clinical detection of PIH patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30757948>Cardiac Sympathetic Denervation Suppresses Atrial Fibrillation and Blood Pressure in a Chronic Intermittent Hypoxia Rat Model of Obstructive Sleep Apnea.</a></h1><p>Background Chronic intermittent hypoxia ( CIH ) is a distinct pathological mechanism of obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ), which is recognized as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The aims of this study were to ascertain whether CIH induces atrial fibrillation ( AF ), to determine whether cardiac sympathetic denervation ( CSD ) can prevent it and suppress blood pressure, and to explore the potential molecular mechanisms involved. Methods and Results Sixty Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham, CSD , CIH , CIH + CSD . The rats were exposed either to CIH 8 hours daily or normoxia for 6 weeks. Cardiac pathology and structure were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin staining and echocardiogram. ECG, blood pressure, , and blood gas were recorded. Connexin 43 and  hydroxylase were detected by western blot, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. CIH induced atrial remodeling, and increased AF inducibility. CSD treatment reduced postapneic blood pressure rises and AF susceptibility, which could attenuate CIH -associated structural atrial arrhythmogenic remodeling. In addition, CIH -induced sympathetic nerve hyperinnervation and CSD treatment reduced sympathetic innervation, which may affect CIH -induced AF -associated sympathovagal imbalance. Connexin 43 was specifically downregulated in CIH , whereas CSD treatment increased its expression. Conclusions These results suggested CIH induces atrial remodeling, increases AF inducibility, results in sympathetic nerve hyperinnervation, and decreases connexin 43 expression, but CSD treatment reduces AF susceptibility, postapneic blood pressure increase, sympathetic innervation, and the alteration of Cx43, which may be a key point in the genesis of CIH -induced AF .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195212>Management of adverse events associated with  kinase inhibitors: Improving outcomes for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of primary liver cancer. Sorafenib, regorafenib, lenvatinib and cabozantinib are  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target, in part, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, and are approved in various regions of the world for the treatment of advanced HCC. All these agents are associated with a range of adverse events (AEs) that can have a substantial impact on patients' health-related quality of life. Fatigue, diarrhoea, hand-foot skin reaction, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, hypertension and  loss are among the most common AEs experienced with these four TKIs. In this review, we discuss strategies for the management of these AEs in patients with advanced HCC, with the aim of maximizing treatment benefits and minimizing the need for TKI treatment discontinuation. We also consider potential TKI-drug interactions and discuss the use of TKIs in patients with liver dysfunction or who have experienced tumour recurrence after liver transplantation. Use of appropriate AE management strategies and avoidance of contraindicated drugs should help patients with advanced HCC to achieve optimal outcomes with TKIs.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Metabolomics can be used to investigate this altered metabolism via targeted and untargeted techniques. In this study we assessed the changes in the intra- and extracellular low molecular  metabolite levels of  () during 48 h of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) supplemented with UV-B (15 µmol m s of PAR plus 3 µmol m s of UV-B) and intracellular levels during 48 h of PAR only (15 µmol m s) with sampling points at 0, 2, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used as a metabolite profiling tool to investigate the global changes in metabolite levels. The UV-B time series experiment showed an overall significant reduction in intracellular metabolites involved with carbon and nitrogen metabolism such as the amino acids  and phenylalanine which have a role in secondary metabolite production. Significant accumulation of proline was observed with a potential role in stress mitigation as seen in other photosynthetic organisms. 12 commonly identified metabolites were measured in both UV-B exposed (PAR + UV-B) and PAR only experiments with differences in significance observed. Extracellular metabolites (PAR + UV-B) showed accumulation of sugars as seen in other cyanobacterial species as a stress response to UV-B. In conclusion, a snapshot of the metabolome of  was measured. Little work has been undertaken on , a novel candidate for use in industrial biotechnology, with, to our knowledge, no previous literature on combined intra- and extracellular analysis during a UV-B treatment time-series.

However, the mechanisms of these IF benefits in humans require further investigation. This study sought to elucidate some of these mechanisms through secondary analyses of the Fasting and ExprEssion of Longevity Genes during fOOD abstinence (FEELGOOD) trial, in which apparently healthy participants were randomized in a Latin square design to a 24-h water-only fast and a 24-h ad libitum fed day. Two pathways were investigated, with trimethylamine -oxide (TMAO) levels measured due to their association with elevated risk of CAD, along with conductance of a broad panel of metabolic analytes. Measurements were made at baseline, at the end of the fasting day, and at the end of the fed day. A fasting mean of 14.3 ng in TMAO was found versus the baseline mean of 27.1 ng with  = 0.019, although TMAO levels returned to baseline on refeeding. Further, acute alterations in levels of proline, , galactitol, and urea plasma levels were observed along with changes in 24 other metabolites during the fasting period. These acute changes reveal short-term mechanisms which, with consistent repeated episodes of IF, may lead to improved health and reduced risk of CAD and diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30993651>Lenvatinib: A Review in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Lenvatinib (Lenvima) is an oral small molecule inhibitor of multiple receptor  kinases, and is approved for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the USA, EU, Japan and China. The approval of lenvatinib was based on results of the randomized, open-label, multinational, non-inferiority phase III REFLECT trial in patients with unresectable HCC, who had not received treatment for advanced disease. In REFLECT, lenvatinib was non-inferior, but not superior, to sorafenib (current standard of care) for overall survival (OS). However, lenvatinib was associated with significant improvements compared with sorafenib in terms of all secondary endpoints [higher objective response rate (ORR), and longer progression-free survival (PFS) and time to progression (TTP)]. Lenvatinib had a generally manageable tolerability profile in REFLECT, with the most common treatment-emergent adverse events being hypertension, diarrhoea, decreased appetite and decreased . Given its non-inferior efficacy to sorafenib and manageable tolerability profile, lenvatinib represents a long-awaited alternative option to sorafenib for the first-line systemic treatment of patients with unresectable HCC. Further clinical experience may be required to fully define the position of lenvatinib in this setting.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629370>Phytochemical identification from Lithocarpus polystachyus by UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS and its protein  phosphatase 1B and α-glucosidase activities.</a></h1><p>Lithocarpus polystachyus leaves have become popular healthful tea due to its antidiabetic activity.

Efficacy and safety data for nilotinib in the Asian population is scarce, particularly in Pakistan. We aimed to determine the MR to nilotinib and its safety profile in patients with chronic phase CML.This observational study was conducted among 173 patients with newly diagnosed CML presenting in the chronic phase. Most patients (50.1%) had a high Sokal score at diagnosis. All patients received nilotinib 600 mg/day. The hematological and molecular responses were assessed at 3 and 6 months respectively and thereafter at 6-monthly intervals. Long-term event free survival (EFS), transformation free survival (TFS), overall survival (OS) and adverse events were observed.Cumulative incidence of major MR (MMR) was 86% and deep MR (DMR ie MR 4.0 and MR4.5) was 39%. Early MMR and DMR after 6 months of therapy were achieved by 74.9% and 37% of patients, respectively. Two-year EFS, TFS and OS rates for all patients were 91.9%, 92% and 92.3%, respectively. At median follow-up of 24 months, 81% and 49% of patients sustained MMR and DMR, respectively.

The mechanisms causing dysregulation of AVP secretion are unknown. Our hypothesis is that inappropriate AVP release associated with liver failure is due to increased Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) in the supraoptic nucleus (SON). BDNF diminishes GABAA inhibition in SON AVP neurons by increasing intracellular chloride through  receptor kinase B (TrkB) activation and downregulation of K+/Cl- co-transporter 2 (KCC2). This loss of inhibition could increase AVP secretion. This hypothesis was tested using shRNA against BDNF in the SON in bile duct ligated (BDL) male rats. All BDL rats had significantly increased liver  (p<0.05; 6-9) compared to shams. BDL rats with control shRNA injections (BDL SCR) developed hyponatremia with increased plasma AVP and copeptin (CPP) (all p<0.05; 6-9) compared to sham groups. This is the first study to show that phosphorylation of TrkB is significantly increased along with significant decrease in phosphorylation of KCC2 in BDL SCR rats compared to the sham rats (p<0.05;6-8). Knockdown of BDNF in the SON of BDL rats (BDL shBDNF) significantly increased plasma osmolality and hematocrit compared to BDL SCR rats (p<0.05; 6-9). The BDL shBDNF rats had significant (p<0.05; 6-9) decreases in plasma AVP and CPP concentration compared to BDL SCR rats. The BDNF knockdown also significantly blocked the increase in TrkB phosphorylation and decrease in KCC2 phosphorylation (p<0.05; 6-8). The results indicate that BDNF produced in the SON contributes to increased AVP secretion and hyponatremia during liver failure.© 2019 S.

Alternative treatment options include the use of large neutral amino acids (LNAA). The aim of this study was to determine the Phe,  (Tyr), and Phe/Tyr ratio in a cohort of sub-optimally controlled adult patients with classical PKU treated with a new LNAA formulation. Twelve patients received a Phe-restricted diet plus a slow-release LNAA product taken three times per day, at a dose of 1 g/kg  (mean 0.8 ± 0.24 g/kg/day), over a 12-month period. The product is in a microgranulated formulation, which incorporates all amino acids and uses sodium alginate as a hydrophilic carrier to prolong its release. This LNAA formulation provides up to 80% of the total protein requirement, with the rest of the protein supplied by natural food. Patients had fortnightly measurements of Phe and Tyr levels over a 12-month period after the introduction of LNAA. All patients completed the 12-month treatment period. Overall, adherence to the new LNAA tablets was very good compared with a previous amino acid mixture, for which taste was a major complaint by patients. Phe levels remained unchanged ( = 0.0522), and Tyr levels increased ( = 0.0195). Consequently, the Phe/Tyr ratio decreased significantly ( < 0.05) in the majority of patients treated. In conclusion, LNAA treatment increases Tyr levels in sub-optimally controlled adult PKU patients, while offering the potential to improve their adherence to treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31053732>Publisher Correction: Simple  Derivatives Act as Low Molecular  Organogelators.</a></h1><p>A correction to this article has been published and is linked from the HTML and PDF versions of this paper.

One such stimulus was given to adult male Wistar rats by injecting different concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 50, 300, 500 g/kg and 5 mg/kg i.p.). To verify the systemic effect of the LPS administration, the serum content of C-reactive protein (CRP), the variation of  and cellular changes in the spleen, liver and kidney were determined. Motor impairment was evaluated by rotarod and open field tests. Microglia activation and dopaminergic degeneration was confirmed by immunolabelling for CD11b/c (microglia) and  hydroxylase (TH), respectively. The cell counting was performed in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), microglial activation was explored in SNpc, substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr), substantia nigra pars compacta dorsal (SNcd) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). For the statistical analysis, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc test (p ≤ 0.05) was used.

Meanwhile, the primary structure of the 33-mer is associated with the adaptive immune response in celiac patients, and the structural transformation of the 33-mer into protofilaments activates a primordial innate immune response in human macrophages. This means that accumulation, oligomerisation and structural transformation of the 33-mer could be the unknown first event that triggers the disease. Herein, we reveal the early stepwise mechanism of 33-mer oligomerisation by combining multiple computational simulations,  cross-linking, fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism experiments. Our theoretical findings demonstrated that the partial charge distribution along the 33-mer molecule and the presence of glutamine that favours H-bonds between the oligomers are the driving forces that trigger oligomerisation. The high content of proline is critical for the formation of the flexible PPII secondary structure that led to a β structure transition upon oligomerisation. Experimentally, we stabilised the 33-mer small oligomers by dityrosine cross-linking, detecting from dimers to higher molecular  oligomers, which confirmed our simulations. The relevance of 33-mer oligomers as a trigger of the disease as well as its inhibition may be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of gluten-related disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668688>Metabolomics of Aerobic Exercise in Chronic Stroke Survivors: A Pilot Study.</a></h1><p>Understanding the metabolic response to exercise may aid in optimizing stroke management. Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate plasma metabolomic profiles in chronic stroke survivors following aerobic exercise training.Participants (age: 62 ± 1 years,  mass index: 31 ± 1 kg/m, mean ± standard error of the mean) were randomized to 6 months of treadmill exercise (N = 17) or whole- stretching (N = 8) with preintervention and postintervention measurement of aerobic capacity (VOpeak). Linear models for microarray data expression analysis was performed to determine metabolic changes over time, and Mummichog was used for pathway enrichment analysis following analysis of plasma samples by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry.VOpeak change was greater following exercise than stretching (18.9% versus -.2%; P < .01). Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed metabolites results showed significant enrichment in 4 pathways following treadmill exercise, 3 of which (heparan-, chondroitin-, keratan-sulfate degradation) involved connective tissue metabolism and the fourth involve lipid signaling (linoleate metabolism). More pathways were altered in pre and post comparisons of stretching, including branched-chain amino acid, tryptophan, , and urea cycle, which could indicate loss of lean  mass.These preliminary data show different metabolic changes due to treadmill training and stretching in chronic stroke survivors and suggest that in addition to improved aerobic capacity, -bearing activity, like walking, could protect against loss of lean  mass. Future studies are needed to examine the relationship between changes in metabolomic profiles to reductions in cardiometabolic risk after treadmill rehabilitation.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611405>Tissue-specific FAH deficiency alters sleep-wake patterns and results in chronic tyrosinemia in mice.</a></h1><p>Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) is the last enzyme in  catabolism, and mutations in the  gene are associated with hereditary tyrosinemia type I (HT1 or TYRSN1) in humans. In a behavioral screen of -ethyl--nitrosourea mutagenized mice we identified a mutant line which we named "" (, MGI:3611216) with a nonsynonymous point mutation (N68S) in  that caused age-dependent disruption of sleep-wake patterns. Mice homozygous for the mutation had an earlier onset of activity (several hours before lights off) and a reduction in total activity and  when compared with wild-type or heterozygous mice. Despite abnormal behavioral entrainment to light-dark cycles, there were no differences in the period or phase of the central clock in mutant mice, indicating a defect downstream of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Interestingly, these behavioral phenotypes became milder as the mice grew older and were completely rescued by the administration of NTBC [2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione], an inhibitor of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, which is upstream of FAH. Mechanistically, the  mutation had no effect on the enzymatic activity of FAH, but rather promoted the degradation of the mutant protein. This led to reduced FAH protein levels and enzymatic activity in the liver and kidney (but not the brain or fibroblasts) of homozygous mice. In addition, plasma -but not methionine, phenylalanine, or succinylacetone-increased in homozygous mice, suggesting that  mutants provide a model of mild, chronic HT1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646603>Efficacy of the synergic action of myoinositol, , selenium and chromium in women with PCOS.</a></h1><p>The aim of the study is to investigate the efficacy of a treatment with myoinositol plus , selenium, and chromium in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).One hundred and eighty-six women, with diagnosis of PCOS, were divided in four groups according to their clinical features.

We performed a pooled analysis to explore the frequency of severe adverse effects in advanced or RR-DTC patients treated with sorafenib and lenvatinib.We performed a comprehensive search of computerized databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Ovid, EMASE, and the Cochrane Library, from the drugs' inception to July 2018 to identify clinical trials. All grade and severe adverse events (AEs; grade ≥3) were analyzed. This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines.In total, seve studies published from 2012-2018 with 657 patients were eligible for this study. We included two studies (238 patients) that received 200 mg sorafenib twice and five studies (419 patients) that received 24 mg lenvatinib daily. The frequency of AEs was different among the two drugs. Patients in the sorafenib group had a significantly higher frequency of all grade hand-foot syndrome, hypocalcemia, rash, elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Conversely, the lenvatinib group experienced more frequent all grade voice change, hypertension, nausea, and vomiting compared with those with sorafenib. For grade ≥3 adverse effects, hand-foot syndrome, hypocalcemia, and elevated ALT were more frequent in sorafenib-treated patients. Moreover, lenvatinib-treated patients had a significantly higher incidence of severe  loss, hypertension, and nausea.Significant differences in common adverse effects, such as all-grade and severe AEs, were detected between sorafenib and lenvatinib in the current study. Early intervention and management of treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) can minimize the impact on patients' quality-of-life, and avoid unnecessary dose reductions and treatment-related discontinuations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31244783>Safety of  Kinase Inhibitors in Patients With Differentiated Thyroid Cancer: Real-World Use of Lenvatinib and Sorafenib in Korea.</a></h1><p> Thyroid cancer has become the most common cancer in Korea. Generally, thyroid cancer patients have a good prognosis; however, 15-20% of patients experience recurrence or distant metastasis or are refractory to standard treatment. We assessed the safety of sorafenib and lenvatinib in patients with advanced or metastatic radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC) consecutively treated at a tertiary center in South Korea.  We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all consecutive patients with DTC treated during ≥6 months with lenvatinib (February 2016-April 2018) and sorafenib (January 2014-April 2018) at Gangnam Severance Hospital. Patients were treated according to the prescribing information of each drug and were followed up for 2 months. We evaluated the adverse events (AEs) reported with each drug.  A total of 71 medical records (lenvatinib,  = 23; sorafenib,  = 48) were reviewed. The most common histological types were papillary thyroid cancer (69.0%) and follicular thyroid cancer (22.5%). All patients ( = 23) started lenvatinib at a dose of 20 mg; 41.7% of sorafenib-treated patients received an initial dose of 800 mg daily. Four (17.4%) lenvatinib-treated patients and 26 (54.2%) sorafenib-treated patients required treatment discontinuation. The most common AEs of any grade in the lenvatinib group were diarrhea (82.6%), hypertension (78.3%), hand-foot skin reaction (56.5%),  loss (52.2%), proteinuria (47.8%), and anorexia (43.5%). In the sorafenib group, these were hand-foot skin reaction (87.5%), diarrhea (62.5%), anorexia (60.4%), alopecia (56.3%), mucositis (52.1%),  loss and generalized weakness (each, 50%), and hypertension (43.8%). The incidence of hand-foot skin reaction, alopecia, and rash of any grade was significantly lower ( = 0.003,  = 0.017, and  = 0.017) in patients treated with lenvatinib compared with those treated with sorafenib.

Women can develop OSA during late pregnancy, which is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. However, the effects of OSA throughout pregnancy on fetoplacental outcomes are unknown. Using a mouse model of intermittent hypoxia, we evaluated main uterine artery function, spiral artery remodelling, circulating angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors, and placental hypoxia and oxidative stress at gestational day 14.5 in pregnant mice. Gestational intermittent hypoxia increased placental  but decreased fetal , impaired uterine artery function, increased circulating angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors, and induced placental hypoxia and oxidative stress, but had no impact on spiral artery remodelling. Our results suggest that pregnant women experiencing OSA during pregnancy could be at risk of maternal and fetal complications.Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is characterized by chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH) and is associated with increased inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. OSA is a common sleep disorder and remains under-diagnosed; it can increase the risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnant women. We investigated the effects of gestational IH (GIH) on uterine artery function, spiral artery remodelling and placental circulating angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors in pregnant female mice. WT C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks) were exposed to either GIH (  12%) or intermittent air (  21%) for 14.5 days of gestation. Exposure to GIH reduced fetal  but increased placental . GIH dams had higher plasma levels of oxidative stress (8-isoprostane) and inflammatory markers (tumour necrosis factor-α). GIH significantly reduced uterine artery function as indicated by reduced endothelium-dependent vasodilatation and enhanced vasoconstriction. Plasma levels of placental angiogenic and anti-angiogenic markers (soluble fms-like  kinase-1, soluble endoglin, angiogenic placental growth factor-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor) were higher in pregnant mice exposed to GIH. There was no evidence of impaired spiral artery remodelling based on immunostaining with α-smooth muscle actin and cytokeratin-7, and also by measurements of lumen area. Immunostaining for markers of hypoxia (pimonidazole) and oxidative stress (4-hydroxynonenal) were higher in mice exposed to GIH. Our data show that GIH adversely affects uterine vascular function and may be a mechanism by which gestational OSA leads to adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.© 2019 The Authors.

CD44 is the most important HA receptor, and both have been associated with poor prognosis in cancer. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the presence of a constitutively activated  kinase (Breakpoint Cluster Region - Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog1, BCR-ABL). It is mainly treated with BCR-ABL inhibitors, such as imatinib. However, the selection of resistant cells leads to treatment failure. The aim of this work was to determine the capacity of HA (high molecular ) to counteract the effect of imatinib in human CML cell lines (K562 and Kv562). We demonstrated that imatinib decreased HA levels and the surface expression of CD44 in both cell lines. Furthermore, HA abrogated the anti-proliferative and pro-senescent effect of Imatinib without modifying the imatinib-induced apoptosis. Moreover, the inhibition of HA synthesis with 4-methylumbelliferone enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of imatinib. These results suggest that Imatinib-induced senescence would depend on the reduction in HA levels, describing, for the first time, the role of HA in the development of resistance to imatinib. These findings show that low levels of HA are crucial for an effective therapy with imatinib in CML.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742833>Postprandial Nutrient Handling and Gastrointestinal Hormone Secretion After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass vs Sleeve Gastrectomy.</a></h1><p>Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) induce substantial  loss and improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, but it is not clear whether these occur via the same mechanisms. We compared absorption rates of glucose and protein, as well as profiles of gastro-entero-pancreatic hormones, in patients who had undergone SG or RYGB vs controls.We performed a cross-sectional study of 12 patients who had undergone sleeve gastrectomy, 12 patients who had undergone RYGB, and 12 individuals who had undergone neither surgery (controls), all in Denmark. Study participants were matched for  mass index, age, sex, and postoperative  loss, and all had stable . They received continuous infusions of stable isotopes of glucose, glycerol, phenylalanine, , and urea before and during a mixed meal containing labeled glucose and intrinsically phenylalanine-labeled caseinate. Blood samples were collected for 6 hours, at 10- to 60-minute intervals, and analyzed.The systemic appearance of ingested glucose was faster after RYGB and SG vs controls; the peak glucose appearance rate was 64% higher after RYGB, and 23% higher after SG (both P < .05); the peak phenylalanine appearance rate from ingested casein was 118% higher after RYGB (P < .01), but similar between patients who had undergone SG and controls. Larger, but more transient increases in levels of plasma glucose and amino acids were accompanied by higher secretion of insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1, peptide YY, and cholecystokinin after RYGB, whereas levels of ghrelin were lower after SG, compared with RYGB and controls. Total 6-hour oral recovery of ingested glucose and protein was comparable among groups.Postprandial glucose and protein absorption and gastro-entero-pancreatic hormone secretions differ after SG and RYGB. RYGB was characterized by accelerated absorption of glucose and amino acids, whereas protein metabolism after SG did not differ significantly from controls, suggesting that different mechanisms explain improved glycemic control and  loss after these surgical procedures.

The  phosphatases protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and T cell protein  phosphatase (TCPTP) attenuate leptin and insulin signaling and are elevated in the hypothalami of obese mice. We report that elevated PTP1B and TCPTP antagonize hypothalamic leptin and insulin signaling and contribute to the maintenance of obesity. Deletion of PTP1B and TCPTP in the hypothalami of obese mice enhances CNS leptin and insulin sensitivity, represses feeding, and increases browning, to decrease adiposity and improve glucose metabolism. The daily intranasal administration of a PTP1B inhibitor, plus the glucocorticoid antagonist RU486 that decreases TCPTP expression, represses feeding, increases browning, promotes  loss, and improves glucose metabolism in obese mice. Our findings causally link heightened hypothalamic PTP1B and TCPTP with leptin and insulin resistance and the maintenance of obesity and define a viable pharmacological approach by which to promote  loss in obesity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Here, a comprehensive set of metabolic markers, predominantly lipids, was compared between depressed and nondepressed persons.Nine Dutch cohorts were included, comprising 10,145 control subjects and 5283 persons with depression, established with diagnostic interviews or questionnaires. A proton nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics platform provided 230 metabolite : 51 lipids, fatty acids, and low-molecular- metabolites; 98 lipid composition and particle concentration  of lipoprotein subclasses; and 81 lipid and fatty acids ratios. For each metabolite measure, logistic regression analyses adjusted for gender, age, smoking, fasting status, and lipid-modifying medication were performed within cohort, followed by random-effects meta-analyses.Of the 51 lipids, fatty acids, and low-molecular- metabolites, 21 were significantly related to depression (false discovery rate q < .05). Higher levels of apolipoprotein B, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, diglycerides, total and monounsaturated fatty acids, fatty acid chain length, glycoprotein acetyls, , and isoleucine and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, acetate, and apolipoprotein A1 were associated with increased odds of depression. Analyses of lipid composition indicators confirmed a shift toward less high-density lipoprotein and more very-low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride particles in depression. Associations appeared generally consistent across gender, age, and  mass index strata and across cohorts with depressive diagnoses versus symptoms.This large-scale meta-analysis indicates a clear distinctive profile of circulating lipid metabolites associated with depression, potentially opening new prevention or treatment avenues for depression and its associated cardiometabolic comorbidity.Copyright © 2019 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

In this study, we present the successful and clinically relevant use of commercially available phospho-protein arrays for analyses of the phosphorylation profiles of a broad spectrum of receptor  kinases and their downstream signaling proteins in tumor tissue samples. Although these arrays were made for research purposes on human biological samples, they have already been used by several authors to profile various tumor types. Our study performed a systematic analysis of the advantages and pitfalls of the use of this method for personalized clinical medicine. In certain clinical cases and their series, we demonstrated the important aspects of data processing and evaluation, the use of phospho-protein arrays for single sample and serial sample analyses, and the validation of obtained results by immunohistochemistry, as well as the possibilities of this method for the hierarchical clustering of pediatric solid tumors. Our results clearly show that phospho-protein arrays are apparently useful for the clinical consideration of druggable molecular targets within a specific tumor. Thus, their potential validation for diagnostic purposes may substantially improve the personalized approach in the treatment of relapsed or refractory solid tumors.Copyright © 2019 Neradil, Kyr, Polaskova, Kren, Macigova, Skoda, Sterba and Veselska.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30884464>Rapid pleural effusion after discontinuation of lenvatinib in a patient with pleural metastasis from thyroid cancer.</a></h1><p>We report a case of rapid pleural effusion after discontinuation of lenvatinib. A 73-year-old woman was diagnosed with poorly differentiated thyroid cancer with right pleural metastasis. Weekly paclitaxel treatment was performed for 18 weeks, but it was not effective. Oral administration of lenvatinib, a multi-target  kinase inhibitor, reduced the size of cervical and thoracic tumors and lowered serum thyroglobulin levels. Lenvatinib was discontinued on day 28 because of Grade 2 thrombocytopenia and Grade 3 petechiae. Seven days after discontinuation of lenvatinib, the patient was hospitalized because of dyspnea and right pleural effusion. Pleural effusion rapidly improved with drainage and re-initiation of lenvatinib and did not recur. Anorexia caused by lenvatinib led to undernutrition, which resulted in death 13 months after initiation of lenvatinib. Autopsy revealed extensive necrosis with primary and metastatic lesions, suggesting that the patient responded to lenvatinib. Physicians should be aware of the possibility of flare-up in patients with thyroid cancer treated with lenvatinib. Learning points: Autopsy findings revealed that lenvatinib was efficacious in treating poorly differentiated thyroid cancer without primary lesion resection. Flare-up phenomenon may occur in thyroid cancer treated with lenvatinib. Attention should be paid to flare-up phenomenon within a few days of discontinuing lenvatinib.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30877063>Properties of FDA-approved small molecule protein kinase inhibitors.</a></h1><p>Because mutations, overexpression, and dysregulation of protein kinases play essential roles in the pathogenesis of many illnesses, this enzyme family has become one of the most important drug targets in the past 20 years. The US FDA has approved 48 small molecule protein kinase inhibitors, nearly all of which are orally effective with the exceptions of netarsudil (which is given as an eye drop) and temsirolimus (which is given intravenously). Of the 48 approved drugs, the majority (25) target receptor protein- kinases, ten target non-receptor protein- kinases, and 13 target protein-serine/threonine protein kinases. The data indicate that 43 of these drugs are used in the treatment of malignancies (36 against solid tumors including lymphomas and seven against non-solid tumors, e.g., leukemias). Seven drugs are used in the treatment of non-malignancies: baricitinib, rheumatoid arthritis; fostamatinib, chronic immune thrombocytopenia; ruxolitinib, myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera; nintedanib, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; sirolimus, renal graft vs. host disease; netarsudil, glaucoma; tofacitinib, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, and ulcerative colitis. Moreover, ibrutinib and sirolimus are used for the treatment of both malignant and non-malignant diseases. The most common drug targets include ALK, B-Raf, BCR-Abl, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR). Most of the small molecule inhibitors (45) interact directly with the protein kinase domain. In contrast, sirolimus, temsirolimus, and everolimus are larger molecules (MW ≈ 1000) that bind to FKBP-12 to generate a complex that inhibits mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). This review presents the available drug-enzyme X-ray crystal structures for 27 of the approved drugs as well as the chemical structures and physicochemical properties of all of the FDA-approved small molecule protein kinase antagonists. Six of the drugs bind covalently and irreversibly to their target. Twenty of the 48 drugs have molecular  greater than 500, exceeding a Lipinski rule of five criterion. Excluding the macrolides (everolimus, sirolimus, temsirolimus), the average molecular  of drugs is 480 with a range of 306 (ruxolitinib) to 615 (trametinib). Nearly half of the antagonists (23) have a lipophilic efficiency with values of less than five while the recommended optima range from 5-10. One of the vexing problems is the near universal development of resistance that is associated with the use of small molecule protein kinase inhibitors for the treatment of cancer.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A Au electrode has the potential capability to detect various small biomolecules with ultrasensitivity at nM levels on the basis of a surface redox reaction, but it exhibits no selective response to such biomolecules. Therefore, a suitable polymeric nanofilter is designed and modified on the Au electrode, so that a small target biomolecule reaches the Au surface, resulting in an electrical signal, whereas low-molecular- interferences not approaching the Au surface are captured in the polymeric nanofilter. The polymeric nanofilter is composed of two layers. The first layer is electrografted as an anchor layer by a cyclic voltammetry method. Then, a filtering layer is precisely polymerized as the second layer by a photo-mediated surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization method. The thickness and density of the polymeric nanofilter are controlled to specifically detect a small target biomolecule with high sensitivity. As a model case, l-cysteine as the small target biomolecule at nM levels is specifically detected by filtering l-DOPA as a low-molecular- interference using the polymeric nanofilter-grafted EG-Au-FET on the basis of the following mechanism. The phenylboronic acid (PBA) that copolymerizes with the polymeric nanofilter captures l-DOPA through diol binding, whereas l-cysteine reaches the Au surface through the filter layer. The polymeric nanofilter can also effectively prevent the interaction between biomacromolecules such as albumin and the Au electrode. A platform based on a polymeric nanofilter-grafted EG-Au-FET biosensor is suitable for the ultrasensitive and specific detection of a small biomolecule in biological samples such as tears and sweat, which include small amounts of low-molecular- interferences, which generate nonspecific electrical signals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31430310>Mice deficient in protein  phosphatase receptor type Z (PTPRZ) show reduced responsivity to methamphetamine despite an enhanced response to novelty.</a></h1><p>Methamphetamine (METH), a commonly abused drug, elevates extracellular dopamine (DA) levels by inducing DA efflux through the DA transporter (DAT). Emerging evidence in rodent models suggests that locomotor responses to a novel inescapable open field may predict behavioral responses to abused drugs; METH produces more potent stimulant effects in high responders to novelty than in low responders. We herein found that mice deficient in protein  phosphatase receptor type Z (Ptprz-KO) exhibited an enhanced behavioral response to novelty; however, METH-induced hyperlocomotion was significantly lower in Ptprz-KO than in wild-type mice when METH was administered at a non-toxic dose of 1 mg per kg  (bdw). Single-cell RT-PCR revealed that the majority of midbrain DA neurons expressed PTPRZ. No histological alterations were observed in the mesolimbic or nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways in Ptprz-KO brains; however, a significant decrease was noted in brain DA turnover, suggesting functional alterations. In vivo microdialysis experiments revealed that METH-evoked DA release in the nucleus accumbens was significantly lower in Ptprz-KO mice than in wild-type mice. Consistent with this result, Ptprz-KO mice showed significantly fewer cell surface DAT as well as weaker DA uptake activity in striatal synaptosomes prepared 1 hr after the administration of METH than wild-type mice, while no significant differences were observed in the two groups treated with saline. These results indicate that the high response phenotype of Ptprz-KO mice to novelty may not be simply attributed to hyper-dopaminergic activity, and that deficits in PTPRZ reduce the effects of METH by reducing DAT activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31271659>Changes in whole metabolites after exenatide treatment in overweight/obese polycystic ovary syndrome patients.</a></h1><p>Exenatide is a new agent for diabetes therapy, and its use in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has gradually increased; however, the clinical benefit and metabolic improvement need further evidence.

The metabolite changes were detected with nontargeted gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (NTGC-MS) before and after exenatide treatment, and changes in clinical biochemical characteristics were also observed.A total of 62 metabolites were differentially expressed between the healthy and PCOS groups, and 31 differentially expressed metabolites were detected before and after exenatide treatment. Abnormal lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism were the main metabolic disorders. Exenatide improved lipid and amino acid metabolism, especially amino acid metabolites. Three types of branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine and isoleucine), two types of aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine and ) and lysine are important potential metabolites for the therapeutic efficacy of exenatide. Many abnormal metabolic disorders are related to insulin resistance, oxidative stress and even ovulatory dysfunction. Moreover, in this small sample clinical study, we also found that exenatide improved insulin sensitivity, reduced  and improved glycolipid metabolism in PCOS.NTGC-MS-based metabolic pathway analysis revealed that exenatide has a beneficial effect on overweight/obese PCOS patients by regulating metabolic disorders, especially amino acid disorders.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608804>Silk sericin intake leads to increases in L-serine and  levels in the mouse brain and the simultaneous facilitation of brain noradrenergic turnover.</a></h1><p>Sericin is a protein component of the silkworm cocoon, and contains a high proportion of L-serine, but it has been mostly disposed of as an industrial waste. However, recent studies have revealed its unique biological functionalities beneficial to human health. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of acute oral intake of sericin on amino acid and neurotransmitter metabolism in the mouse brain. Acute administration of chemically modified sericin (0.26 g/30 g ) increased L-serine and  levels in the serum and brain, although the  content in the sericin was less than 3% (w/w). In addition, sericin administration led to a significant facilitation of noradrenergic turnover via enhancement of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol, a principal metabolite of noradrenaline, in several of the brain regions examined. These present findings suggest that oral intake of sericin efficiently delivers L-serine and  to the brain, thus stimulating noradrenergic activity in the brain. : DA: dopamine; 5-HIAA: 5-hydroxyindoleicetic acid; 5-HT: 5-hydroxytryptamine; HVA: homovanillic acid; MHPG: 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol; 3-MT: 3-methoxytyramine; NA: noradrenaline; NM: normetanephrine; Veh: vehicle.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443117>Volatile Oil from Acorus gramineus Ameliorates the Injury Neurons in the Hippocampus of Amyloid Beta 1-42 Injected Mice.</a></h1><p>In recent years, the extraction fraction of volatile oil from Acorus gramineus has significant effects on anti-dementia and improving the learning and memory of animals. To date, limited studies have determined whether volatile oil from A. gramineus has the protective effect on neuronal damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of volatile oil from A. gramineus on Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice, by means of behavior test, immunohistochemistry and western blot methods. In this study, mice were injected with Aβ in the bilateral hippocampus to establish the AD model. On the seventh day after modeling, the mice with cognitive dysfunction were selected by the novel object recognition task. Subsequently, the volatile oil treatment groups underwent intragastric administration for per 10 g  2.5 or 5 μL volatile oil from A. gramineus for 3 weeks. The control group and the AD group were given the same amount of saline. Our results showed that after treatment of volatile oil from A. gramineus, the number of Doublecortin and Nestin positive cells increased significantly, suggesting that the volatile oil from A. gramineus may induce the regeneration of hippocampal neurons in mice, and promote the growth of hippocampal neurons by upregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor,  protein kinase B, and neurotrophin-3 expression. These results might provide more experimental evidences for underlying mechanism about the neuroprotective effects of volatile oil from A. gramineus against AD relevant symptoms.

We report the first case of coexisting latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood (LADA) and glucokinase (GCK) MODY. A 32-year-old woman was treated with insulin for gestational diabetes at age 32 years; post-partum, her fasting blood glucose was 6.0 mmol/L and 2-h glucose was 11.8 mmol/L following an oral glucose tolerance test, and she was maintained on diet alone. Five years later, a diagnosis of LADA was made when she presented with fasting blood glucose of 20.3 mmol/L and HbA1C 125 mmol/mol (13.6%). GCK-MODY was identified 14 years later when genetic testing was prompted by identification of a mutation in her cousin. Despite multiple daily insulin injections her glycaemic control remained above target and her clinical course has been complicated by multiple episodes of hypoglycaemia with unawareness. Although rare, coexistence of latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood and monogenic diabetes should be considered if there is a strong clinical suspicion, for example, family history. Hypoglycaemic unawareness developed secondary to frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia using standard glycaemic targets for LADA. This case highlights the importance of setting fasting glucose targets within the expected range for GCK-MODY in subjects with coexisting LADA. Learning points: We report the first case of coexisting latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood (LADA) and GCK-MODY. It has been suggested that mutations in GCK may lead to altered counter-regulation and recognition of hypoglycaemia at higher blood glucose levels than patients without such mutation. However, in our case, hypoglycaemic unawareness developed secondary to frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia using standard glycaemic targets for LADA. This case highlights the importance of setting fasting glucose targets within the expected range for GCK-MODY in subjects with coexisting LADA to avoid hypoglycaemia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31269360>Distribution and chemical coding of urinary bladder apex-projecting neurons in aorticorenal and testicular ganglia of the male pig.</a></h1><p>Combined retrograde tracing and double-labelling immunofluorescence were used to investigate the distribution and chemical coding of neurons in aorticoerenal (ARG) and testicular (TG) ganglia supplying the urinary bladder apex (UBA) in the juvenile male pig (n=4, 12 kg. ). Retrograde fluorescent tracer Fast Blue (FB) was injected into the wall of the bladder apex under pentobarbital anesthesia. After three weeks all the pigs were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 4% buffered paraformaldehyde. TG and ARG were collected and processed for double-labelling immunofluorescence. The presence of  hydroxylase (TH) or dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), neuropeptide Y (NPY), somatostatin (SOM), galanin (GAL), nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) were investigated. The cryostat sections were examined with a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope equipped with adequate filter blocks. The TG and ARG were found to contain many FB-positive neurons projecting to the UBA (UBA-PN). The UBA-PN were distributed in both TG and ARG. The majority were found in the left ganglia, mostly in TG. Immunohistochemistry disclosed that the vast majority of UBA-PN were noradrenergic (TH- and/or DBH-positive). Many noradrenergic neurons also contained immunoreactivity to NPY, SOM or GAL. Most of the UBA-PN were supplied with varicose VAChT-, or NOS- IR (immunoreactive) nerve fibres. This study has revealed a relatively large population of differently coded ARG and TG neurons projecting to the porcine urinary bladder. As judged from their neurochemical organization these nerve cells constitute an important element of the complex neuro-endocrine system involved in the regulation of the porcine urogenital organ function.Copyright© by the Polish Academy of Sciences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31106906>The effect of dietary high energy density and carbohydrate energy ratio on digestive enzymes activity, nutrient digestibility, amino acid utilization and intestinal morphology of weaned piglets.</a></h1><p>This study evaluated the effect of high or low digestible energy ratio of carbohydrate in a high or normal dietary energy density on performance, amino acid utilization and intestinal functions of weaned piglets. A total of 32 healthy weaners (9.60 ± 0.13 kg) were allocated to two dietary energy densities (3,400 and 3,800 kcal/kg) and two digestible energy ratio of carbohydrate to fat (9:1 and 3:1) in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. There were eight piglets per treatment. The feed intake of piglets was significantly increased by dietary high carbohydrate ratio (9:1) (p < 0.01); however, this did not result in improved  gain (p > 0.05). The piglets fed high carbohydrate energy ratio had a reduced villus height/crypt depth (VH/CD) ratio in the duodenum (p < 0.05), and dietary high energy density further decreased the VH/CD ratio in the ileum (p < 0.01). In the duodenum, the lymphocyte count was increased by dietary high energy density (p < 0.05), while dietary energy density and carbohydrate energy ratio interacted to increase lymphocyte count in the ileum (p < 0.05). The serum cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein were not significantly affected (p > 0.05), but dietary energy density interacted with dietary energy ratio to increase high-density lipoprotein concentration (p < 0.05) in piglets fed reduced carbohydrate energy ratio. Dietary high energy density reduced energy digestibility (p < 0.05), whereas high carbohydrate energy ratio increased crude protein digestibility in the piglets (p < 0.05). The intestinal sucrase, lactase activities and serum concentrations of histidine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, alanine, glycine,  and citrulline were higher in the piglets fed dietary increased carbohydrate energy ratio. Oxidative stress markers and volatile fatty acids concentrations were altered by the dietary treatments. It was concluded that dietary high energy density could be detrimental to piglets intestinal functions and that increased carbohydrate energy ratio could affect amino acid utilization and  gain in weaner pigs.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30697189>Klotho Gene and Protein in Human Placentas According to Birth  and Gestational Age.</a></h1><p> Fetal growth restriction may be the consequence of maternal, fetal, or placental factors. The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are major determinants of fetal growth, and are expressed in the mother, fetus and placenta in most species. Previously we reported higher placental protein content of IGF-I, IGF-IR, and AKT in small (SGA) compared with those from appropriate for gestational age (AGA) placentas. The protein Klotho, has been reported in placenta and may regulate IGF-I activity. In this study we determined Klotho gene expression and protein immunostaining in term (T-SGA y T-AGA) and preterm (PT-SGA y PT-AGA) human placentas. In addition, we assessed the effect of Klotho on the IGF-IR and AKT activation induced by IGF-I.  Placentas ( = 1 17) from 32 T-SGA (birth  (BW) = -1.74 ± 0.08 SDS), 37 T-AGA (BW = 0.12 ± 0.12 SDS), 20 PT-SGA (BW = -2.08 ± 0.14 SDS), and 28 PT-AGA (BW = -0.43 ± 0.13 SDS) newborns were collected. mRNA expression by RT-PCR in the chorionic (CP) and basal (BP) plates of the placentas, and the presence of Klotho was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (integral optical density, IOD). In addition, we developed placental explants that were incubated with IGF-I in the presence or absence of Klotho.  We found a lower mRNA expression and protein immunoreactivity of Klotho in the CP of SGA (term and preterm) compared with AGA placentas. We also observed a significant reduction in IGF-IR  activation induced by IGF-I 10 nM when preincubated with 2.0 nM of Klotho (2.4 ± 0.5 arbitrary units vs. 1.3 ± 0.3 AU), and similar results we observed on AKT and ERK activation.  We describe for the first time that Klotho mRNA and protein varies according to fetal growth and gestational age. In addition, Klotho appears to down-regulate the activation induced by IGF-I on IGF-IR and AKT, suggesting that Klotho may be regulating IGF-I activity in human placentas according to intrauterine fetal growth.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706914>Characterization of natural melanin from Auricularia auricula and its hepatoprotective effect on acute alcohol liver injury in mice.</a></h1><p>This study characterized the natural melanin from Auricularia auricula and investigated its hepatoprotective effect on mice with acute alcoholic liver injury. The characterization of the melanin was analyzed based on elemental analysis, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-visible), infrared spectrum (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (NMR). To determine the liver protective effect of Auricularia auricula melanin, mice were administered with the melanin once daily for 3 weeks before ethanol induced liver injury. Biochemical parameters of liver function, histopathological sections, mRNA and protein expression of antioxidant enzyme were compared between mice with or without the melanin administered. Results showed that A. auricula melanin was a eumelanin and the average molecular  was 48.99 kDa. The melanin can protect the mice from ethanol-induced liver injury by extending the duration of the righting reflex, and shortening the duration of the recovery. The liver index, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT) and liver malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in mice treated with the melanin were significantly decreased. At the same time, the levels of liver alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and antioxidase such as catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were increased. Its protective effect may be related to the activation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its downstream antioxidant enzymes such as glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC), glutamate cysteine ligase modifier (GCLM), and NADP(H) quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1). These results suggested that A. auricula melanin may be an effective strategy to alleviate alcohol-induced liver damage.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593888>The nitroxide 4-methoxy-tempo inhibits the pathogenesis of dextran sodium sulfate-stimulated experimental colitis.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition characterised by leukocyte recruitment to the gut mucosa. Leukocyte myeloperoxidase (MPO) produces the two-electron oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl), damaging tissue and playing a role in cellular recruitment, thereby exacerbating gut injury. We tested whether the MPO-inhibitor, 4-Methoxy-TEMPO (MetT), ameliorates experimental IBD. Colitis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by 3% w/v dextran-sodium-sulfate (DSS) in drinking water ad libitum over 9-days with MetT (15 mg/kg; via i. p. injection) or vehicle control (10% v/v DMSO+90% v/v phosphate buffered saline) administered twice daily during DSS challenge. MetT attenuated  loss (50%, p < 0.05, n = 6), improved clinical score (53%, p < 0.05, n = 6) and inhibited serum lipid peroxidation. Histopathological damage decreased markedly in MetT-treated mice, as judged by maintenance of crypt integrity, goblet cell density and decreased cellular infiltrate. Colonic Ly6C, MPO-labelled cells and 3-chlorotyrosine (3-Cl-Tyr) decreased in MetT-treated mice, although biomarkers for nitrosative stress (3-nitro--; 3-NO-Tyr) and low-molecular  thiol damage (assessed as glutathione sulfonamide; GSA) were unchanged. Interestingly, MetT did not significantly impact colonic IL-10 and IL-6 levels, suggesting a non-immunomodulatory pathway. Overall, MetT ameliorated the severity of experimental IBD, likely via a mechanism involving the modulation of MPO-mediated damage.Copyright © 2019.

However, its effect on menopausal cardiac insulin resistance is needing further research. We investigated protective effects of low-intensity exercise on cardiac insulin signaling, inflammation, regulation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in ovariectomized (OVX) Wistar rats, submitted to 10% fructose solution for 9 weeks. OVX rats were divided into control, sedentary fructose, and exercise fructose groups. Measurements of physical and biochemical characteristics were carried out to evaluate metabolic syndrome development. Messenger RNA and protein levels and phosphorylation of cardiac insulin signaling molecules, endothelial and inducible NOS (eNOS and iNOS), p65 subunit of nuclear factor κB (NFκB), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), and MMP-9 were analyzed. Fructose increased insulin level, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index, and visceral adipose tissue , while low-intensity exercise prevented insulin level and HOMA index increase. Fructose also decreased cardiac pAkt (Ser473), peNOS (Ser1177) and increased insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) phosphorylation at Ser307, pNFκB (Ser276) and NFκB and MMP-9 content, without any effect on iNOS, protein- phosphatase 1B, TNF-α, and SOCS3. Exercise prevented changes in pIRS1 (Ser307), pAkt (Ser473), peNOS (Ser1177), pNFκB (Ser276), and NFκB expression. In addition, exercise increased pIRS1 (Tyr632), pAkt (Thr308), and eNOS expression. Low-intensity exercise prevented cardiac insulin signaling disarrangement in fructose-fed OVX rats and therefore eNOS dysfunction, as well as pro-inflammatory signaling activation, without effect on tissue remodeling, suggesting physical training as a way to reduce cardiovascular risk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30736828>Baicalin regulates the dopamine system to control the core symptoms of ADHD.</a></h1><p>We aimed to test the therapeutic effects of baicalin on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in an animal model and to explain the potential mechanism. We investigated the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of baicalin in a spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model of ADHD depending on the dopamine (DA) deficit theory. In this study, fifty SHRs were randomly divided into five groups: methylphenidate (MPH), baicalin (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, or 150 mg/kg), and saline-treated. Ten Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were used as controls. All rats were orally administered the treatment for four weeks. Motor activity, spatial learning and memory ability were assessed with the open-field and Morris water-maze tests. The mRNA and protein levels of  hydroxylase (TH), vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), synaptosomal-associated protein of molecular mass 25kD (SNAP25) and synataxin 1a in synaptosomes were detected with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot. In addition, DA levels were measured in the prefrontal cortex and striatum. The results indicated that both MPH and baicalin at doses of 150 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg significantly decreased the hyperactivity and improved the spatial learning memory deficit in the SHRs and increased the synaptosomal mRNA and protein levels of TH, SNAP25, VMAT2 and synataxin 1a compared with saline treatment. MPH significantly increased DA levels in both the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum, while baicalin significantly increased DA levels only in the striatum. The results of the present study showed that baicalin treatment was effective for controlling the core symptoms of ADHD. Baicalin increased DA levels only in the striatum, which suggested that baicalin may target the striatum. The increased DA levels may partially be attributed to the increased mRNA and protein expression of TH, SNAP25, VMAT2, and syntaxin 1a. Therefore, these results suggested that the pharmacological effects of baicalin were associated with the synthesis, vesicular localization, and release of DA and might be effective in treating ADHD. However, further studies are required to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these findings.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31044472>Molecular characteristics of microbially mediated transformations of Synechococcus-derived dissolved organic matter as revealed by incubation experiments.</a></h1><p>In this study, we investigated the microbially mediated transformation of labile Synechococcus-derived DOM to RDOM using a 60-day experimental incubation system. Three phases of TOC degradation activity (I, II and III) were observed following the addition of Synechococcus-derived DOM. The phases were characterized by organic carbon consumption rates of 8.77, 1.26 and 0.16 μmol L day , respectively. Excitation emission matrix analysis revealed the presence of three FDOM components including -like, fulvic acid-like, and humic-like molecules. The three components also exhibited differing biological availabilities that could be considered as labile DOM (LDOM), semi-labile DOM (SLDOM) and RDOM, respectively. DOM molecular composition was also evaluated using FT-ICR MS. Based on differing biological turnover rates and normalized intensity values, a total of 1704 formulas were identified as candidate LDOM, SLDOM and RDOM molecules. Microbial transformation of LDOM to RDOM tended to proceed from high to low molecular , as well as from molecules with high to low double bond equivalent (DBE) values. Relatively higher aromaticity was observed in the formulas of RDOM molecules relative to those of LDOM molecules. FDOM components provide valuable proxy information to investigate variation in the bioavailability of DOM. These results suggest that coordinating fluorescence spectroscopy and FT-ICR MS of DOM, as conducted here, is an effective strategy to identify and characterize LDOM, SLDOM and RDOM molecules in incubation experiments emulating natural systems. The results described here provide greater insight into the metabolism of phytoplankton photosynthate by heterotrophic bacteria in marine environments.© 2019 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604999>Small molecule FAK activator promotes human intestinal epithelial monolayer wound closure and mouse ulcer healing.</a></h1><p>GI mucosal healing requires epithelial sheet migration. The non-receptor  kinase focal adhesion kinase (FAK) stimulates epithelial motility. A virtual screen identified the small drug-like FAK mimic ZINC40099027, which activates FAK. We assessed whether ZINC40099027 promotes FAK-Tyr-397 phosphorylation and wound healing in Caco-2 monolayers and two mouse intestinal injury models. Murine small bowel ulcers were generated by topical serosal acetic acid or subcutaneous indomethacin in C57BL/6J mice. One day later, we began treatment with ZINC40099027 or DMSO, staining the mucosa for phosphorylated FAK and Ki-67 and measuring mucosal ulcer area, serum creatinine, ALT, and  at day 4. ZINC40099027 (10-1000 nM) dose-dependently activated FAK phosphorylation, without activating Pyk2-Tyr-402 or Src-Tyr-419. ZINC40099027 did not stimulate proliferation, and stimulated wound closure independently of proliferation. The FAK inhibitor PF-573228 prevented ZINC40099027-stimulated wound closure. In both mouse ulcer models, ZINC40099027accelerated mucosal wound healing. FAK phosphorylation was increased in jejunal epithelium at the ulcer edge, and Ki-67 staining was unchanged in jejunal mucosa. ZINC40099027 serum concentration at sacrifice resembled the effective concentration in vitro. , creatinine and ALT did not differ between groups. Small molecule FAK activators can specifically promote epithelial restitution and mucosal healing and may be useful to treat gut mucosal injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30890610>First Betalain-Producing Bacteria Break the Exclusive Presence of the Pigments in the Plant Kingdom.</a></h1><p>The biosynthesis of antioxidant pigments, namely, betalains, was believed to be restricted to Caryophyllales plants. This paper changes this paradigm, and enzyme mining from bacterial hosts promoted the discovery of bacterial cultures producing betalains. The spectrum of possible sources of betalain pigments in nature is broadened by our description of the first betalain-forming bacterium,  The enzyme-specific step is the extradiol cleavage of the precursor amino acid l-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) to form the structural unit betalamic acid. Molecular and functional work conducted led to the characterization of a novel dioxygenase, a polypeptide of 17.8 kDa with a  of 1.36 mM, with higher activity and affinity than those of its plant counterparts. Its superior activity allowed the first experimental characterization of the early steps in the biosynthesis of betalains by fully characterizing the presence and time evolution of 2,3- and 4,5-seco-DOPA intermediates. Furthermore, spontaneous chemical reactions are characterized and incorporated into a comprehensive enzymatic-chemical mechanism that yields the final pigments. Several studies have demonstrated the health-promoting effects of betalains due to their high antioxidant capacity and their positive effect on the dose-dependent inhibition of cancer cells and their proliferation. To date, betalains were restricted to plants of the order Caryophyllales and some species of fungi, but the present study reveals the first betalain-producing bacterium, as well as the first steps in the formation of pigments. This finding demonstrates that betalain biosynthesis can be expanded to prokaryotes.Copyright © 2019 Contreras-Llano et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30851071>Reduced lung cancer burden by selective immunomodulators elicits improvements in muscle proteolysis and strength in cachectic mice.</a></h1><p>Identification of to what extent tumor burden influences muscle mass independently of specific treatments for cancer-cachexia remains to be elucidated.

Nontreated lung cancer cachectic mice were the controls. T and B cell numbers and macrophages were counted in tumors of both mouse groups. Compared to nontreated cachectic mice, in the mAbs-treated animals, T cells increased, no differences in B cells or macrophages, the variables final ,  and grip strength gains significantly improved. In diaphragm and gastrocnemius of mAbs-treated cachectic mice, number of apoptotic nuclei,  release, proteolysis, and apoptosis markers significantly decreased compared to nontreated cachectic mice. Systemic levels of troponin-I significantly decreased in treated cachectic mice compared to nontreated animals. We conclude that reduced tumor burden as a result of selective treatment of the lung cancer cells with immunomodulators elicits per se beneficial effects on muscle mass loss through attenuation of several biological mechanisms that lead to increased protein breakdown and apoptosis, which translated into significant improvements in limb muscle strength but not in physical activity parameters.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30865465>Glatiramer Acetate (Copaxone) is a Promising Gene Delivery Vector.</a></h1><p>Glatiramer acetate (GA) is the active substance of Teva's Copaxone drug, which contains random polypeptides used to treat multiple sclerosis. Glatiramer acetate was originally developed to emulate human myelin basic protein, which contains four different residues [alanine (A), glutamic acid (E),  (T), and lysine (K)]. We found that GA can complex, condense, and transfect plasmid DNA. Mixing the positively charged GA and the negatively charged genetic material in correct proportions produced small, stable, and highly positively charged nanoparticles. This simple GA-pDNA formulation produced high levels of transfection efficiency with low toxicity in HeLa and A549 cells (lung and cervical cancer cells). Additionally, we studied and compared the nanoparticle properties, gene expression, and cytotoxicity of K-pDNA (high-molecular- polylysine) and K-pDNA (low-molecular- polylysine) nanoparticles to those of GA-pDNA nanoparticles. We also studied the effect of calcium, which was previously reported to reduce the size and enhance gene expression resulting from similar polyelectrolyte complexes. Adding calcium did not reduce particle size, nor improve the transfection efficiency of GA-pDNA nanoparticles as it did for polylysine-pDNA nanoparticles. GA-pDNA nanoparticles may be prepared by mixing a genetic payload with approved GA therapeutics (e.g., Copaxone), thus offering intriguing possibilities for translational gene therapy studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30634019>Isopsoralen induces different subchronic toxicities and metabolomic outcomes between male and female Wistar rats.</a></h1><p>Isopsoralen is a major active and quality-control component of Fructus Psoraleae, but lacks a full safety evaluation. We evaluated the oral toxicity of isopsoralen in Wistar rats treated for 3 months at doses of 0, 3.5, 7.0, and 14 mg/kg. Additionally, the plasma metabolomics of isopsoralen in male and female rats treated for 3 months at doses of 0 and 14 mg/kg were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Many abnormalities were observed in the isopsoralen-treated rats, including suppression of  gain, and changes in serum biochemical parameters and visceral coefficients. Histopathological changes in liver, pancreatic, and reproductive system tissues were also observed in the isopsoralen-treated rats. The metabolomic analyses showed alterations in many metabolites (19 in female rats; 28 in male rats) after isopsoralen administration. The significant changes in these metabolites revealed metabolomic alterations in the isopsoralen-treated rats, especially in amino acid metabolism regardless of sex, including phenylalanine, , and tryptophan biosynthesis and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism. Furthermore, fatty acid metabolism comprised the main affected pathways in female rats, while lipid metabolism and energy metabolism were the main affected pathways in male rats.Copyright © 2019.

This study investigated the quantity and chemical quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) released from the biochar prepared from the typical wetland plant (Typha orientalis) at different pyrolysis temperatures (300-700 °C) by using fluorescence excitation-emission (EEM) spectrophotometry with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and UV-Visible spectroscopy. The results showed that the content of DOM released from biochars at low pyrolysis temperatures (300-500 °C) was higher than that observed at high pyrolysis temperatures (600-700 °C). The distribution of DOM components (mainly including three humic acid-like substances, one fulvic acid-like substance and one -like substance) varied significantly due to the increase of pyrolysis temperatures. The fulvic acid-like material was the key DOM component at the low pyrolysis temperature while the humic acid-like material became dominant at the high temperature.

This study aimed to identify the differences in gut bacterial community structure between LBW infants who received probiotics and LBW infants who did not receive probiotics.Forty-one infants were allocated to the non-probiotic group (N group) and 56 infants to the probiotic group (P group), according to whether the formula they received contained a probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis. Gut bacterial composition was identified with sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene in fecal samples collected at 14 days after birth.There was no significant difference between the alpha diversity of the two groups, while the beta diversity was significantly different (p < 0.05). Our results showed that Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus (both p < 0.05) were enriched in the P group, while Veillonella, Dolosigranulum and Clostridium sensu stricto 1 (all p < 0.05) were enriched in the N group. Predicted metagenome function analysis revealed enhancement of fatty acids, peroxisome, starch, alanine,  and peroxisome pathways in the P group, and enhancement of plant pathogen, Salmonella and Helicobacter pylori infection pathways in the N group.Probiotic supplement in formula may affect the composition, stability and function of LBW infants' gut microbiota. LBW infants who receive probiotic intervention may benefit from gut microbiota that contains more beneficial bacteria.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629919>Effects of masitinib compared with tadalafil for the treatment of monocrotaline-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension in rats.</a></h1><p>Targeting vascular remodeling in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains a challenge given the lack of potent anti-remodeling abilities of the therapeutic drugs. Although sildenafil has been shown to ameliorate cardiopulmonary remodeling, that of tadalafil is questionable. Masitinib, a  kinase inhibitor appears safer and more potent than imatinib for treatment of malignancies, but its efficacy on PAH is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the anti-remodeling properties of masitinib (5, 15, 50 mg/kg) and tadalafil (5, 10 mg/kg) using a monocrotaline-induced rat model of PAH. The 14-day treatment with masitinib (15, 50 mg/kg) resulted in significantly decreased right ventricular (RV) systolic pressure (RVSP) and hypertrophy (RVH), and pulmonary vascular remodeling, whereas tadalafil showed weaker anti-remodeling properties. Besides, masitinib significantly blocked the mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and reduced phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5 mRNA expression in the lungs. By contrast, tadalafil did not significantly inhibit the MAPK pathway. Further, the 28-day treatment extension revealed that masitinib-treated rats (15 mg/kg) had significantly lower RVSP, and higher heart rate and serum cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) level, whereas those treated with tadalafil (10 mg/kg) showed insignificantly lower RVSP and higher cGMP level. Moreover, the RVH indices, heart rates,  gains, and survival rates of rats in both groups were comparable. Collectively, these results suggest that the treatment with a low-dose masitinib was non-inferior than tadalafil. A lower dose of masitinib may represent a novel approach to target both the cardiopulmonary remodeling and the dysregulated vasoconstriction in PAH.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

For experiments, mice were divided into either the OIR group or control group. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran cardiac perfusion and stretched retina preparation were performed. The total retina area, area of instillation, density of microvascular network, area of new blood vessels, vein width and the tortuosity of arteries were measured. Next, mice were randomly assigned into the PBS, soluble TEK receptor  kinase (sTie2)-fusion protein (Fc), angiopoietin 1 (Ang1), ranibizumab, ranibizumab + sTie2-Fc and ranibizumab + Ang1 treatment groups. Following housing for 5 days, the  of each mouse was recorded. Mice in the OIR group presented smaller total retina area and larger area of instillation, larger area of new blood vessels, and higher microvascular network density compared with the control PBS group. Obvious retinal vein dilatation and arterial tortuosity were identified in the OIR group. The amount of endotheliocyte nuclei of new vessels beyond the inner limiting membrane was larger in the OIR group compared with the control group. Furthermore in the next set of experiments, a larger area of instillation, smaller area of new blood vessels and decreased amount of endotheliocyte nuclei of new vessels were observed in the sTie2-Fc group, Ang1 group, ranibizumab group, ranibizumab + sTie2-Fc group and ranibizumab + Ang1 group compared with the PBS group. Specifically, the ranibizumab + sTie2-Fc group and ranibizumab + Ang1 group demonstrated markedly reduced retina instillation area and microvascular network density in the instillation area. Total retina area and  following 10 days of the experiment for the ranibizumab group were significantly lower compared with other groups. In conclusion, the combined regulation of the Ang/Tie2 and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor pathways markedly increased the efficacy of treatment with retinal neovascularization (RNV). Regulation of these pathways has a potential for treating RNV, in particular ROP.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798394>Analysis of major BCR-ABL1 mRNA by digital polymerase chain reaction is useful for prediction of international scale.</a></h1><p>Major BCR-ABL1 mRNA in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has generally been analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Application of the international scale (IS) for the quantification of major BCR-ABL1 mRNA has been recommended in several sets of guidelines, including those of the European LeukemiaNet. The aim of this study was to clarify the efficacy of digital PCR technology for the IS of BCR-ABL1 mRNA in the patients with CML by comparing with real-time PCR.The analysis of BCR-ABL1 mRNA was carried out by the Ipsogen BCR-ABL1 Mbcr IS-MMR DX Kit (Qiagen), and the QuantStudio 3D Digital PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific‎) using 20 peripheral blood samples obtained from the 9 patients with CML at Sapporo Medical University Hospital.The correlation between the data obtained by digital PCR and by real-time PCR was really high at R = 0.96. The detection limit of digital PCR was up to 0.003% and was equal to IS with 0.01% or less in comparison with real-time PCR.Digital PCR technology is promising for predicting the IS value with similar efficacy to real-time PCR and should be useful for simple monitoring of the effects of  kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatments.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30767618>Analytical validation of fecal 3-bromotyrosine concentrations in healthy dogs and dogs with chronic enteropathy.</a></h1><p>Studies that have used serum 3-bromotyrosine (3-BrY) to investigate eosinophil activation in dogs have found elevated 3-BrY levels in clinical patients with chronic enteropathy (CE). To our knowledge, a method to measure 3-BrY concentrations in feces has not been reported. We developed and analytically validated an electron ionization gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method to measure fecal 3-BrY concentrations in dogs. The mean and maximum fecal 3-BrY concentrations in healthy dogs ( n = 40) and dogs with CE ( n = 40) over 3 consecutive days were compared. Analytical validation had a limit of blank and a limit of detection of 2.5 and 3.7 mmol/g of feces, respectively. The mean coefficients of variation for precision and reproducibility for 3-BrY were 11.2% (range: 7.5-14.2%) and 10.1% (4.8-15.2%), respectively. The ranges of observed-to-expected ratios for linearity and accuracy were 81.3-125% and 85.4-120%, respectively. The reference intervals for mean and maximum fecal 3-BrY concentrations in 40 healthy dogs were 3.7-23.0 and 3.7-37.8 mmol/g of feces. Mean and maximum fecal 3-BrY concentrations in dogs with CE were significantly higher than those of healthy dogs ( p < 0.001).

However, biochemical recurrence is observed in approximately 20% of cases, even with negative surgical margins, and some cases require salvage therapy. The elevated expression of low-molecular- protein  phosphatase (LMW-PTP, MW 18 kDa) is associated with a poor prognosis of certain cancers. In this study, we investigated whether the LMW-PTP expression levels could be used as a biomarker of recurrence in prostate cancer with negative surgical margins.The subjects of this retrospective study were 119 patients who underwent total prostatectomy with negative resection margins. LMW-PTP expression was categorized either as a high-expression group or as a low-expression group bye two pathologists. Subsequently, we examined the relationship between LMW-PTP expression levels and clinicopathological factors including biochemical recurrence.Evaluation of the immunostained samples by two pathologists was highly reliable, with an Intraclass correlation (ICC) score for two distinct measurements of 0.77 and 0.98, respectively. Seventy-three patients (61.3%) were placed in the LMW-PTP high expression group; and 46 patients (38.7%) were placed in the low expression group. The log-rank test revealed early biochemical recurrence in the high LMW-PTP expression group (p=0.0001). In addition, pathological T stage (p=0.004), lymphatic invasion (p=0.0456), Ki-67 labeling index (p=0.0002), and biochemical recurrence (p<0.0001) were more frequently identified in the LMW-PTP high expression group. Furthermore, multivariate analyses revealed that a high LMW-PTP expression level was an independent prognostic factor for biochemical recurrence (HR=3.14, 95% CI=1.37-8.07, p=0.0057). In addition, Ki-67 labeling indices were significantly higher in the high-expression group compared to the low-expression group (p<0.0001).LMW-PTP can be assessed using a single immunostaining protocol in a highly reproducible fashion. Tt may, thus, be applied clinically to establish the required postoperative follow-up period and determine the necessity for salvage therapy in cases of prostate cancer with negative surgical margins. LMW-PTP has the potential to be a highly useful prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target in conjunction with other factors, such as the Gleason Score, the pathological T stage and the PSA level.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

In patients with liver cirrhosis, the maintenance of the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) levels is important during muscle synthesis at night. Therefore, we investigated the effects of a LES with BCAAs on the Fischer ratio in patients with liver cirrhosis.This study included 10 outpatients with liver cirrhosis who did not consume a LES. Regarding the patient characteristics, the mean age was 73.1 ± 8.9 years, the male:female ratio was 5:5, and the mean  mass index was 23.3 ± 2.4 kg/m. The etiology was hepatitis C virus in eight patients and alcoholism in two patients. Amino acid levels were measured in all 10 patients at four time points: before LES (control) and 1 month after the administration of each BCAA. The administration levels included 1) LES: BCAA-enriched enteral nutrition (BCAA-EN) containing BCAAs 6.1 g as a LES; 2) GP-no LES: BCAA-enriched granule product (BCAA-GP) containing 4 g BCAAs per pack, two packs per day, and BCAA-EN until dinner containing BCAAs in total 14.1 g per day; and 3) GP-LES: BCAA-GP, two packs per day, and BCAA-EN as a LES containing BCAAs in total 14.1 g per day. The Friedman nonparametric test with a post-hoc Dunn's multiple comparison was used for statistical analyses.There were no significant changes in  and serum albumin levels between the three types of BCAA administration. Valine significantly increased following LES and GP-LES, isoleucine significantly increased following GP-LES, and  significantly decreased following LES and GP-LES compared with those in the control. There was no significant difference in the leucine and phenylalanine levels among the groups. The Fischer ratio in the LES (2.2 ± 0.8) and GP-LES (2.3 ± 0.8) groups were significantly higher than that in the control (1.8 ± 0.6), but there was no significant difference compared with the Fischer ratio in the GP-no LES (1.8 ± 0.7) group. Furthermore, the Fischer ratio was significantly higher in the GP-LES group than in the GP-no LES group.These results suggested that it is not only the amount of BCAAs, but also LES with BCAAs, which is needed to improve the Fischer ratio at fasting.Copyright © 2019.

The goal of this study was to investigate whether there are sex differences in resistance training effects on metabolic alterations induced by monosodium glutamate (MSG), a model of obesity, in male and female rats. Male and female Wistar rats received MSG (4 g/kg /day, s.c.) from postnatal day 1 to 10. After 10 days from MSG administration, the rats were separated into two groups: MSG-sedentary and MSG-exercised. At postnatal day 60, the animals started a resistance training protocol in an 80 degrees inclined vertical ladder apparatus and performed it for 7 weeks. Control rats received saline solution and were divided in saline-sedentary and saline-exercised. Resistance training restored all plasma biochemical parameters (glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase) increased in male and female rats treated with MSG. The MSG administration induced hyperglycemia associated with a decrease in the skeletal muscle glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) levels and accompanied by deregulation in proteins, G-6Pase, and  aminotransferase, involved in hepatic glucose metabolism of male and female rats. MSG induced dyslipidemia and lipotoxicity in the liver and skeletal muscle of male rats. Regarding female rats, lipotoxicity was found only in the skeletal muscle. The resistance training had beneficial effects against metabolic alterations induced by MSG in male and female rats, through regulation of proteins (GLUT2, protein kinase B, and GLUT4) involved in glucose and lipid pathways in the liver and skeletal muscle.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31159256>Low-Dose Stevia (Rebaudioside A) Consumption Perturbs Gut Microbiota and the Mesolimbic Dopamine Reward System.</a></h1><p>Stevia is a natural low-calorie sweetener that is growing in popularity in food and beverage products. Despite its widespread use, little is understood of its impact on the gut microbiota, an important environmental factor that can mediate metabolism and subsequent obesity and disease risk. Furthermore, given previous reports of dysbiosis with some artificial low-calorie sweeteners, we wanted to understand whether prebiotic consumption could rescue potential stevia-mediated changes in gut microbiota. Three-week old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to consume: (1) Water (CTR); (2) Rebaudioside A (STV); (3) prebiotic (PRE); (4) Rebaudioside A + prebiotic (SP) ( = 8/group) for 9 weeks. Rebaudioside was added to drinking water and prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin added to control diet (10%).  and feces were collected weekly and food and fluid intake biweekly. Oral glucose and insulin tolerance tests, gut permeability tests, dual X-ray absorptiometry, and tissue harvest were performed at age 12 weeks. Rebaudioside A consumption alone did not alter  gain or glucose tolerance compared to CTR. Rebaudioside A did, however, alter gut microbiota composition and reduce nucleus accumbens  hydroxylase and dopamine transporter mRNA levels compared to CTR. Prebiotic animals, alone or with Rebaudioside A, had reduced fat mass, food intake, and gut permeability and cecal SCFA concentration. Adding Rebaudioside A did not interfere with the benefits of the prebiotic except for a significant reduction in cecal . Long-term low-dose Rebaudioside A consumption had little effect on glucose metabolism and  gain; however, its impact on gut microbial taxa should be further examined in populations exhibiting dysbiosis such as obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31131471>S100 A9 is expressed and secreted by the oviduct epithelium, interacts with gametes and affects parameters of human sperm capacitation in vitro.</a></h1><p>Our previous findings demonstrate that some oviductal secretion proteins bind to gametes and affect sperm physiology and gamete interaction. One of these proteins possesses an estimated molecular  of 14 kDa. The objective of this study was to isolate and identify this 14 kDa protein, to localize it in the human oviduct, to detect gamete binding sites for the protein, and to evaluate its effects on sperm capacitation parameters and gamete interaction. Explants from the human oviductal tissues of premenopausal women were cultured in the presence of [ S]-Methionine-proteins ([35S]-Met-proteins). De novo synthesized secreted [ S]-Met-proteins were isolated from the culture media by affinity chromatography using their sperm membrane binding ability and analysed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry peptide sequencing, human S100 A9 was identified as one of the isolated proteins from the 14 kDa protein band. S100 A9 was detected in oviduct epithelium and oviduct secretion using immunohistochemistry and a Western blot. S100 A9 binding to human oocytes and spermatozoa was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence. The acrosome reaction (AR) affected S100 A9 ability to bind sperm cells. The presence of S100 A9 significantly increased both the induced AR and the sperm protein  phosphorylation, with respect to controls. However, the protein did not affect sperm-zona pellucida interaction. Results indicate that S100 A9 is present in the human oviduct and that it modulates parameters of sperm capacitation in vitro. Hence, the protein might contribute to the regulation of the reproductive process in the oviductal microenvironment.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934738>Neuroprotective Effects of Thymol, a Dietary Monoterpene Against Dopaminergic Neurodegeneration in Rotenone-Induced Rat Model of Parkinson's Disease.</a></h1><p>Parkinson's disease (PD), a multifactorial movement disorder that involves progressive degeneration of the nigrostriatal system affecting the movement ability of the patient. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation both are shown to be involved in the etiopathogenesis of PD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of thymol, a dietary monoterpene phenol in rotenone (ROT)-induced neurodegeneration in rats that precisely mimics PD in humans. Male Wistar rats were injected ROT at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg  for 4 weeks, to induce PD. Thymol was co-administered for 4 weeks at a dose of 50 mg/kg , 30 min prior to ROT injection. The markers of dopaminergic neurodegeneration, oxidative stress and inflammation were estimated using biochemical assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting and immunocytochemistry. ROT challenge increased the oxidative stress markers, inflammatory enzymes and cytokines as well as caused significant damage to nigrostriatal dopaminergic system of the brain. Thymol treatment in ROT challenged rats appears to significantly attenuate dopaminergic neuronal loss, oxidative stress and inflammation. The present study showed protective effects of thymol in ROT-induced neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration mediated by preservation of endogenous antioxidant defense networks and attenuation of inflammatory mediators including cytokines and enzymes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296884>Quantification of the flux of  pathway metabolites during nitisinone treatment of Alkaptonuria.</a></h1><p>Nitisinone decreases homogentisic acid (HGA) in Alkaptonuria (AKU) by inhibiting the  metabolic pathway in humans. The effect of different daily doses of nitisinone on circulating and 24 h urinary excretion of phenylalanine (PA),  (TYR), hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPPA), hydroxyphenyllactate (HPLA) and HGA in patients with AKU was studied over a four week period. Forty AKU patients, randomised into five groups of eight patients, received doses of 1, 2, 4 or 8 mg of nitisinone daily, or no drug (control). Metabolites were analysed by tandem mass spectrometry in 24 h urine and serum samples collected before and after nitisinone. Serum metabolites were corrected for total  water and the sum of 24 hr urine plus total  water metabolites of PA, TYR, HPPA, HPLA and HGA were determined.  and urine urea were used to check on stability of diet and metabolism over the 4 weeks of study. The sum of quantities of urine metabolites (PA, TYR, HPPA, HPLA and HGA) were similar pre- and post-nitisinone. The sum of total  water metabolites were significantly higher post-nitisinone (p < 0.0001) at all doses. Similarly, combined 24 hr urine:total  water ratios for all analytes were significantly higher post-nitisinone, compared with pre-nitisinone baseline for all doses (p = 0.0002 - p < 0.0001). Significantly higher concentrations of metabolites from the  metabolic pathway were observed in a dose dependant manner following treatment with nitisinone and we speculate that, for the first time, experimental evidence of the metabolite pool that would otherwise be directed towards pigment formation, has been unmasked.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31179345>Distinct Effects of Carrageenan and High-Fat Consumption on the Mechanisms of Insulin Resistance in Nonobese and Obese Models of Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h1><p>Exposure to low concentration of the common food additive carrageenan (10 mg/L) for only six days led to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in the C57BL/6J mouse. Longer exposure produced fasting hyperglycemia but with no increase in , in contrast to the HFD. Glucose intolerance was attributable to carrageenan-induced inflammation and to increased expression of GRB10. Both HFD and carrageenan increased p(Ser32)-IB and p(Ser307)-IRS1, and the increases were greater following the combined exposure. The effects of carrageenan were inhibited by the combination of the free radical inhibitor Tempol and BCL10 siRNA, which had no impact on the HFD-mediated increase. In contrast, the PKC inhibitor sotrastaurin blocked the HFD-induced increases, without an effect on the carrageenan-mediated effects. HFD had no impact on the expression of GRB10. Both carrageenan and high fat increased hepatic infiltration by F4/80-positive macrophages. Serum galectin-3 and galectin-3 binding to the insulin receptor increased by carrageenan and by HFD.  phosphorylation of the insulin receptor declined following either exposure and was further reduced by their combination. Carrageenan reduced the activity of the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (ARSB; arylsulfatase B), which was unchanged following HFD.

Lenvatinib is approved as a monotherapy for the treatment of radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer and in combination with everolimus for the second-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. Lenvatinib is also under investigation for the treatment of several malignancies including unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Although lenvatinib is associated with favorable efficacy, it is associated with adverse events (AEs) that the clinician will have to closely monitor for and proactively manage. Most of these AEs are known class effects of VEGF-targeted therapies, including hypertension, diarrhea, fatigue or asthenia, decreased appetite, and  loss. This review summarizes the safety profile of lenvatinib and offers guidance for the management of both frequent and rare AEs. We discuss the potential mechanisms underlying these AEs and present practical recommendations for managing toxicities. The development of treatment plans that include prophylactic and therapeutic strategies for the management of lenvatinib-associated AEs has the potential to improve patient quality of life, optimize adherence, minimize the need for dose reductions, treatment interruptions, or discontinuations, and maximize patient outcomes.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

As previous report has indicated that the aplidin could inhibit the LMW-PTP, and thus, the relevant cancer caused by the abnormal regulation of the LMW-PTP could be remission. However, the molecular mechanism of inhibition of the LMW-PTP by the aplidin had not been fully understood. In this study, various computational approaches, namely molecular docking, MDs and post-dynamic analyses were utilized to explore the effect of the aplidin on the LMW-PTP. The results suggested that the intramolecular interactions of the residues in the two sides of the active site (Ser43-Ala55 and Pro121-Asn134) and the P-loop region (Leu13-Ser19) in the LMW-PTP was disturbed owing to the aplidin, meanwhile, the π-π interaction between Tyr131 and Tyr132 might be broken. The Asn15 might be the key residue to break the residues interactions. In a word, this study may provide more information for understanding the effect of inhibition of the aplidin on the LMW-PTP.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Standard androgen deprivation therapy and novel androgen axis drugs are commonly well tolerable and can stabilize metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancers for years. However, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer is still challenging to treat. Except taxanes, prostate cancer presents intrinsic resistance against conventional chemotherapies. The typically elderly patient population excludes more aggressive treatment regimens. First clinical trials evaluating immunotherapy or -kinase-inhibitors against prostate cancer failed. In contrast, prostate cancer can be radiosensitive and external beam radiotherapy is effective in localized prostate cancer, thus providing a good rationale for the use of systemic radiopharmaceuticals in the metastatic setting. Beta-particle emitting "bone-seekers" have a long history and are effective as analgesics but do not improve survival because they are limited by red-marrow dose. Alpha emitting Radium can be used in a dose that prolongs survival but is restricted to bone-confined patients. Currently radiolabeled high-affinity ligands to the prostate-specific membrane antigen are in clinical evaluation. While radioimmunotherapy approaches were limited by the long circulation time and slow tumor-accumulation of antibodies, low molecular  PSMA-specific ligands offer an approx. ten-fold improved tumor to red-marrow ratio in comparison to the unspecific bone-seekers. Early clinical studies demonstrate that regarding surrogate markers, such as >50% PSA reduction (60%) and radiologic response (80%), PSMA-therapy exceeds the antitumor activity of all approved or other recently tested compounds; for example, PSA-response was only observed in approx. a total of 10% of patients treated with ipilimumab, sunitinib, cabozantinib, or xofigo, respectively and in approx. 30, 40, 50% of patients treated with abiraterone, cabazitaxel, or enzalutamide. Also progression free and overall survivals of these single-arm studies appear promising when compared to historical controls. Consecutively, the first PSMA-RLT recently advanced into phase-3 (Lu-PSMA-617; VISION-trial). Future developments aim to avoid off-target radiation by ligand-optimization and to outperform the antitumor activity of beta-emitter PSMA-RLT by labeling with highly focused, high energy transferring alpha-nuclides; however the latter potentially also increasing the risk of side-effects and additional early phase studies are needed to improve treatment protocols. Academically clinical research is developing prognostic tools to improve treatment benefit by selecting the most appropriate patients in advance.Copyright © 2019.

NlInR1 is strikingly homologous to the typical InR in insects and vertebrates, containing a ligand-activated intracellular  kinase catalytic domain. Herein, we report an optimized CRISPR/Cas9 system to induce mutations in the NlInR1 locus in BPH, consisting of a Cas9 plasmid that is specifically expressed in the germline via the Nlvasa promoter and versatile sgRNA expression plasmids under the control of the U6 promoter. We systematically evaluated the efficiency of injection mix compositions and demonstrated an appropriate combination of Cas9/sgRNA to target essential genes. Furthermore, we showed that homozygous mutants for the NlInR1 gene are early embryonic lethal, whereas heterozygous mutants grow more slowly, exhibit a severe reduction in  and wing size and live longer than the wild type. Interestingly, the severity of the mutant phenotype was different when targeting distinct important domains of the NlInR1 locus. The severity of the mutant phenotype is similar to that of insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway deficiencies in vertebrates, suggesting a conserved function of NlInR1 in the regulation of development and longevity. Global expression profiling suggests that NlInR1 regulates many cellular processes in BPH, including insulin resistance, phototransduction, metabolism, endocytosis, longevity, biosynthesis and protein processing. Our results also pave the way for understanding the precise molecular mechanism of insulin signaling in wing polyphenism in insects.Copyright © 2019.

This study was designed to develop a prediction model for leukemia-free survival (LFS) in a cohort of patients with de novo AML treated with ASCT during their first complete remission.This was a registry study of 956 patients reported to the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. The primary outcome was LFS. Multivariate Cox regression modeling with backward selection was used to select variables for the construction of the nomogram. The nomogram's performance was evaluated with discrimination (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]) and calibration.Age and cytogenetic risk (with or without FMS-like  kinase 3 internal tandem duplication) were predictive of LFS and were used for the construction of the nomogram. Each factor in the nomogram was ascribed points according to its predictive . Through the calculation of the total score, the probability of LFS at 1, 3, and 5 years for each patient could be estimated. The discrimination of the nomogram, measured as the AUC, was 0.632 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.595-0.669), 0.670 (95% CI, 0.635-0.705), and 0.687 (95% CI, 0.650-0.724), respectively. Further validation with bootstrapping showed similar AUCs (0.629 [95% CI, 0.597-0.657], 0.667 [95% CI, 0.633-0.699], and 0.679 [95% CI, 0.647-0.712], respectively), and this suggested that the model was not overfitted. Calibration was excellent. Patients were stratified into 4 incremental 5-year prognostic groups, with the probabilities of LFS and overall survival ranging from 25% to 64% and from 33% to 79%, respectively.The Auto-AML nomogram score is a tool integrating individual prognostic factors to provide a probabilistic estimation of LFS after ASCT for patients with AML.© 2019 American Cancer Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30772969>[The study of the metabolism of iodotyrosines included in the iodized milk protein in rats].</a></h1><p>In the course of evolution in animals and humans, a complex and effective system for providing the  with iodine in the form of various organic and inorganic compounds was developed. The metabolism of inorganic iodine has been studied quite well, in contrast to the mechanism of assimilation of its organic compounds. Among the latter, iodotyrosines, which are part of iodinated milk proteins, are of particular interest. To distinguish the peculiarities of the biotransformation of iodotyrosines in the animals' organism, their concentration and the concentration of  in blood plasma of rats after single administration of iodinated milk proteins were determined. For comparison, in parallel a group of animals received potassium iodide. The tested preparations were administered intragastrically with a probe in the form of aqueous solutions at a dose equivalent to 30 μg iodine per 1 kg of . The level of mono- and diiodotyrosine in rat blood plasma was determined by HPLC with a mass spectrometer detector. The  content was determined on an automatic amino acid analyzer. The registration of the indices was carried out before the administration and 1, 4 and 24 hours after the administration of the substances. In the course of the conducted studies it was found that when iodinated milk proteins are once administered, a significant increase in the concentrations of monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine is observed. The maximum level of iodinated amino acids, exceeding the control values by more than 6 fold, was recorded 4 hours after the ingestion of iodine-containing organic compounds into the . At the same time interval, an increase in the concentration of  was observed in one of the experimental groups receiving iodinated milk protein. The simultaneous presence of  and its iodinated derivatives in blood plasma may indicate that monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine are capable of being absorbed into the systemic bloodstream without metabolic transformations in the liver. Under introduction of potassium iodide, an increase in blood plasma concentration of monoiodotyrosine by 35% compared to the control was observed only after 24 hours, which may be a consequence of the activation of the thyroid gland due to the intake of an increased amount of iodine.Copyright© GEOTAR-Media Publishing Group.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30999692>Bacterial Isolate Inhabiting Spitsbergen Soil Modifies the Physiological Response of  in Control Conditions and under Exogenous Application of Methyl Jasmonate and Copper Excess.</a></h1><p>The aim of the study was to demonstrate the potential of the promotion and regulation of plant physiology and growth under control and copper stress conditions, and the impact of the exogenous application of methyl jasmonate on this potential. Runner bean plants were treated with methyl jasmonate (1 or 10 µM) (J; J1 or J10) and Cu (50 µM), and inoculated with a bacterial isolate (S17) originating from Spitsbergen soil, and identified as  using the analytical profile index (API) test. Above- and under-ground plant parts were analyzed. The growth parameters; the concentration of the photosynthetic pigments, elements, flavonoids (FLAVO), phenolics (TPC), allantoin (ALLA), and low molecular  organic acids (LMWOAs); the activity of antioxidant enzymes and enzymes of resistance induction pathways (e.g., superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate (APX) and guaiacol (GPX) peroxidase, glucanase (GLU), and phenylalanine (PAL) and  ammonia-lyase (TAL)), and the antioxidant capacity (AC) were studied. The leaves exhibited substantially higher ALLA and LMWOA concentrations as well as PAL and TAL activities, whereas the roots mostly had higher activities for a majority of the enzymes tested (i.e., SOD, CAT, APX, GPX, and GLU). The inoculation with S17 mitigated the effect of the Cu stress. Under the Cu stress and in the presence of J10, isolate S17 caused an elevation of the shoot fresh , K concentration, and TAL activity in the leaves, and APX and GPX (also at J1) activities in the roots. In the absence of Cu, isolate S17 increased the root length and the shoot-to-root ratio, but without statistical significance. In these conditions, S17 contributed to a 236% and 34% enhancement of P and Mn, respectively, in the roots, and a 19% rise of N in the leaves. Under the Cu stress, S17 caused a significant increase in FLAVO and TPC in the leaves. Similarly, the levels of FLAVO, TPC, and AC were enhanced after inoculation with Cu and J1. Regardless of the presence of J, inoculation at Cu excess caused a reduction of SOD and CAT activities, and an elevation of GPX. The effects of inoculation were associated with the application of Cu and J, which modified plant response mainly in a concentration-dependent manner (e.g., PAL, TAL, and LMWOA levels). The conducted studies demonstrated the potential for isolate S17 in the promotion of plant growth.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30611982>Investigation of stereoisomeric bisarylethenesulfonic acid esters for discovering potent and selective PTP1B inhibitors.</a></h1><p>Protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) has been considered as a promising therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity due to its key regulating effects in insulin signaling and leptin receptor pathways. In this work, a series of cis- and trans-pyrrolidine bisarylethenesulfonic acid esters were prepared and their PTP1B inhibitory potency, selectivity and membrane permeability were evaluated. These novel stereoisomeric molecules especially trans-isomers exhibited remarkable inhibitory activity, significant selectivity as well as good membrane permeability (e.g. compound 28a, IC = 120, 1940 and 2670 nM against PTP1B, TCPTP and SHP2 respectively, and P = 1.74 × 10 cm/s). Molecular simulations indicated that trans-pyrrolidine bisarylethenesulfonic acid esters yielded the stronger binding affinity than their cis-isomers by constructing more interactions with non-catalytic sites of PTP1B. Further biological activity studies revealed that compound 28a could enhance insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and insulin-mediated insulin receptor β (IRβ) phosphorylation with no significant cytotoxicity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In the present work, we characterised the changes in endothelial function at early and late stages of breast cancer progression in an orthotopic model of murine mammary carcinoma (4T1 cells). Endothelial function was analysed based on simultaneous microflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using multiple reaction monitoring (microLC/MS-MRM) quantification of 12 endothelium-related biomarkers, including those reflecting glycocalyx disruption - syndecan-1 (SDC-1), endocan (ESM-1); endothelial inflammation - vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), E-selectin (E-sel); endothelial permeability - fms-like  kinase 1 (FLT-1), angiopoietin 2 (Angpt-2); and haemostasis - von Willebrand factor (vWF), tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), as well as those that are pathophysiologically linked to endothelial function - adrenomedullin (ADM) and adiponectin (ADN). The early phase of metastasis in mouse plasma was associated with glycocalyx disruption (increased SDC-1 and ESM-1), endothelial inflammation [increased soluble VCAM-1 (sVCAM-1)] and increased vascular permeability (Angpt-2). During the late phase of metastasis, additional alterations in haemostasis (increased PAI-1 and vWF), as well as a rise in ADM and substantial fall in ADN concentration, were observed. In conclusion, in a murine model of breast cancer metastasis, we identified glycocalyx disruption, endothelial inflammation and increased endothelial permeability as important events in early metastasis, while the late phase of metastasis was additionally characterised by alterations in haemostasis.© 2019.

The mechanisms whereby BPD/DS exerts its positive metabolic effects have however yet to be fully delineated. The objective of this study was to distinguish the effects of the two components of BPD/DS, namely the sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and the DS derivation, on gut microbiota, and to appraise whether changes in microbial composition are linked with surgery-induced metabolic benefits.BPD/DS, DS, and SG were performed in Wistar rats fed a standard chow diet.  and energy intake were measured daily during 8 weeks post-surgery, at which time glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide   (PYY), insulin, and glucose were measured. Fecal samples were collected prior to surgery and at 2 and 8 weeks post-surgery. Intraluminal contents of the alimentary, biliopancreatic, and common limbs (resulting from BPD/DS) were taken from the proximal portion of each limb. Fecal and small intestinal limb samples were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.BPD/DS and DS led to lower digestible energy intake (P = 0.0007 and P = 0.0002, respectively), reduced  gain (P < 0.0001) and  fat mass (P < 0.0001), improved glucose metabolism, and increased GLP-1 (P = 0.0437, SHAM versus DS) and PYY levels (P < 0.0001). These effects were associated with major alterations of both the fecal and small intestinal microbiota, as revealed by significant decrease in bacterial richness and diversity at 2 (P < 0.0001, Chao1 index; P < 0.0001, Shannon index) and 8 weeks (P = 0.0159, SHAM versus DS, Chao1 index; P = 0.0219, SHAM versus DS, P = 0.0472, SHAM versus BPD/DS, Shannon index) post-surgery in BPD/DS and DS, and increased proportions of Bifidobacteriales (a 60% increase in both groups) but reduced Clostridiales (a 50% decrease and a 90% decrease respectively), which were mostly accounted at the genus level by higher relative abundance of Bifidobacterium in both the fecal and intestinal limb samples, as well as reduced abundance of Peptostreptococcaceae and Clostridiaceae in the small intestine. Those effects were not seen in SG rats.The metabolic benefits following BPD/DS are seemingly due to the DS component of the surgery. Furthermore, BPD/DS causes marked alterations in fecal and small intestinal microbiota resulting in reduced bacterial diversity and richness. Our data further suggest that increased abundance of Bifidobacterium and reduced level of two Clostridiales species in the gut microbiota might contribute to the positive metabolic outcomes of BPD/DS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30637824>Muscle wasting and branched-chain amino acid, alpha-ketoglutarate, and ATP depletion in a rat model of liver cirrhosis.</a></h1><p>The aim of the study was to examine whether a rat model of liver cirrhosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) is a suitable model of muscle wasting and alterations in amino acid metabolism in cirrhotic humans. Rats were treated by intragastric gavage of CCl4 or vehicle for 45 days. Blood plasma and different muscle types-tibialis anterior (mostly white fibres), soleus (red muscle) and extensor digitorum longus (white muscle) - were analysed at the end of the study. Characteristic biomarkers of impaired hepatic function were found in the plasma of cirrhotic animals. The  and protein contents of all muscles of CCl4-treated animals were lower when compared with controls. Increased concentrations of glutamine (GLN) and aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine and ) and decreased concentrations of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), glutamate (GLU), alanine and aspartate were found in plasma and muscles. In the soleus muscle, GLN increased more and GLU and BCAA decreased less than in the extensor digitorum and tibialis muscles. Increased chymotrypsin-like activity (indicating enhanced proteolysis) and decreased α-ketoglutarate and ATP levels were found in muscles of cirrhotic animals. ATP concentration also decreased in blood plasma. It is concluded that a rat model of CCl4-induced cirrhosis is a valid model for the investigation of hepatic cachexia that exhibits alterations in line with a theory of role of ammonia in pathogenesis of BCAA depletion, citric cycle and mitochondria dysfunction, and muscle wasting in cirrhotic subjects. The findings indicate more effective ammonia detoxification to GLN in red than in white muscles.© 2019 The Authors.

VLS is associated with increased circulating levels of the Tie2 antagonist ligand, angiopoietin 2, and decreased Tie2 receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling in endothelial cells (ECs). Given that vascular endothelial protein  phosphatase (VE-PTP) is a specific membrane phosphatase in ECs that dephosphorylates Tie2, the effects of targeting VE-PTP by a selective inhibitor AKB-9778 (AKB) in terms of VLS and antitumor efficacy were examined in this study. The authors found, by targeting VE-PTP, that the antitumor effects induced by IL-2 were augmented [tumor-free 44% (IL-2 alone) vs. 87.5% (IL-2+AKB)], associated with enhanced immune cell infiltrate (90% increase for CD8 T cells and natural killer cells). In addition, the side effects of IL-2 therapy were lessened, as demonstrated by diminished lung  (less vascular leakage) as well as reduced cytokine levels (serum HMGB1 from 137.04±2.69 to 43.86±3.65 pg/mL; interferon-γ from 590.52±90.52 to 31.37±1.14 pg/mL). The authors further sought to determine the potential mechanism of the action of AKB-9778. The findings suggest that AKB-9778 may function through reducing serum angiopoietin 2 level and regulating EC viability. These findings provide insights into the targeting VE-PTP to improve tolerance and efficacy of IL-2 therapy and highlight the clinical potential of AKB-9778 for treating patients with VLS and cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176715>Knockout of latrophilin-3 in Sprague-Dawley rats causes hyperactivity, hyper-reactivity, under-response to amphetamine, and disrupted dopamine markers.</a></h1><p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a pervasive developmental disorder characterized by inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity and is 75-90% heritable. Latrophilin-3 (LPHN3; or ADGRL(3)) is associated with a subtype of ADHD, but how it translates to symptoms is unknown. LPHN3 is a synaptic adhesion G protein coupled receptor that binds to fibronectin leucine rich transmembrane protein 3 and teneurin-3 (FLRT3 and TEN-3). We created a null mutation of Lphn3 (KO) in Sprague-Dawley rats using CRISPR/Cas9 to delete exon-3. The KO rats had no effects on reproduction or survival but reduced growth. KO females showed catch-up  gain whereas KO males did not. We tested WT and KO littermates for home-cage activity, anxiety-like behavior, acoustic startle response, and activity after amphetamine challenge. Expression of Lphn3-related genes, monoamines, and receptors were determined. Lphn3 KO rats showed persistent hyperactivity, increased acoustic startle, reduced activity in response to amphetamine relative to baseline, and female-specific reduced anxiety-like behavior. Expression of Lphn1, Lphn2, and Flrt3 by qPCR and their protein products by western-blot analysis showed no compensatory upregulation. Striatal  hydroxylase, aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), and the dopamine transporter were increased and dopamine D1 receptor (DRD1) and dopamine- and cAMP-regulated neuronal phosphoprotein (DARPP-32) decreased with no changes in DRD2, DRD4, vesicular monoamine transporter-2, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-NR1, -NR2A, or -NR2B. LPHN3 is expressed in many brain regions but its function is largely unknown. Data from human, mouse, zebrafish, Drosophila and our new Lphn3 KO rat data collectively show that its disruption is significantly correlated with hyperactivity and associated striatal changes in dopamine markers.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, definite pharmacological effects and mechanisms of ZZHPD on monoaminergic system and hippocampal neurogenesis are ambiguous. It need to be further illuminated.Our study is designed to reveal pharmacological mechanisms of ZZHPD on depression through pharmacokinetics, monoamine neurotransmitters and neurogenesis.Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) is used to establish rats model of depression. Then, the antidepressant effects of ZZHPD are evaluated by detecting , sucrose preference and forced swimming test. The regulatory functions of ZZHPD on monoaminergic system are assessed by measuring monoamine neurotransmitters, neurotransmitter precursor substances, synthesized rate-limiting enzymes and transporters. Finally, potential molecular mechanism of ZZHPD on hippocampal neurogenesis is evaluated by investigating newborn immature neuron and newborn mature neuron.Our results show that ZZHPD remarkably normalizes CUMS-induced decline in  gain, decrease of sucrose consumption rate in sucrose preference test and increase of immobility time in forced swimming test. Moreover, ZZHPD significantly reverses CUMS-induced reduction of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA), tryptophan (Trp),  (Tyr), tryptophan hydroxylase2 (TPH2) and  hydroxylase (TH), whereas decreases level of serotonin transporter (SERT) in CUMS-induced rats. Finally, ZZHPD obviously improves CUMS-induced decrease of newborn immature neuron and newborn mature neuron in dentate gyrus of hippocampus.This study demonstrates that ZZHPD can alleviate CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors. It is probably attributed to the fact that ZZHPD could enhance monoaminergic system and hippocampal neurogenesis. Our findings provide the new perspectives on molecular targets of ZZHPD, and it will facilitate its clinical application.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It has been speculated that hypercoagulation in cancer patients is triggered by direct or indirect contact of platelets with tumor cells, however the underlying molecular mechanisms involved are currently unknown. Unraveling these mechanisms may provide potential avenues for preventing platelet-tumor cell aggregation. Here, we investigated the role of protein  phosphatases in the functionality of platelets in both healthy individuals and patients with gastrointestinal cancer, and determined their use as a target to inhibit platelet hyperactivity. This is the first study to demonstrate that platelet agonists selectively activate low molecular  protein  phosphatase (LMWPTP) and PTP1B, resulting in activation of Src, a  kinase known to contribute to several platelet functions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these phosphatases are a target for 3-bromopyruvate (3-BP), a lactic acid analog currently investigated for its use in the treatment of various metabolic tumors. Our data indicate that 3-BP reduces Src activity, platelet aggregation, expression of platelet activation makers and platelet-tumor cell interaction. Thus, in addition to its anti-carcinogenic effects, 3-BP may also be effective in preventing platelet-tumor cell aggregationin cancer patients and therefore may reduce cancer mortality by limiting VTE in patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31171456>Evolution of nutritional status and survival in patients with cancer on  kinase inhibitors treatment.</a></h1><p>Treatment with oral antineoplastic agents known as  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is new and, thus, little is known about their impact on nutritional status (NS), dietary intake, quality of life, and survival. The aim of this study was to provide information on these components in order to guide future nutritional recommendations.A prospective, observational study in adults who start treatment with TKIs, in whom NS was assessed using the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA), anthropometric , biochemical parameters, and dietary intake (24-hour dietary recall). The EORTC QLQ-C30 was used to assess quality of life. Nonparametric tests were used in statistical analysis, and survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and log-rank curves.Of the overall sample, 21.7% had moderate malnutrition according to PG-SGA, and 74.2% moderate  loss at 6 months, but no patient had BMI<18.5kg/m. Patients with moderate malnutrition had lower survival at four years of diagnosis (log-rank=0.015). Energy intake was lower than recommended by the ESPEN 2017 congress, and no patient covered the protein requirements (1.5g protein/kg ) during follow-up. A worse score on the global health scale of the EORTC QLQ-C30 was related to worse NS.Treatment with TKIs does not appear to have a significant impact on NS and quality of life after 6 months of follow-up. Malnutrition should be prevented through individualized nutritional advice because it is related to shorter survival.Copyright © 2019 SEEN y SED. Publicado por Elsevier España, S.L.U.

We previously reported that molecular hydrogen (H) acts as a therapeutic and preventive anti-oxidant. Here, we show that treatment with H effectively protects the lungs of mice from severe damage caused by oral administration of gefitinib after intraperitoneal injection of naphthalene, the toxicity of which is related to oxidative stress. Drinking H-rich water ad libitum mitigated naphthalene/gefitinib-induced  loss and significantly improved survival, which was associated with a decrease in lung inflammation and inflammatory cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Naphthalene decreased glutathione in the lung, increased malondialdehyde in the plasma, and increased 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal production in airway cells, all of which were mitigated by H-rich water, indicating that the H-rich water reverses cellular damage to the bronchial wall caused by oxidative stress. Finally, treatment with H did not interfere with the anti-tumor effects of gefitinib on a lung cancer cell line in vitro or on tumor-bearing mice in vivo. These results indicate that H-rich water has the potential to improve quality of life during gefitinib therapy by mitigating lung injury without impairing anti-tumor activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31339858>The sFlt-1/PlGF ratio values within the <38, 38-85 and >85 brackets as compared to perinatal outcomes.</a></h1><p>Background Soluble fms-like  kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and placental growth factor (PlGF) are used as markers of preeclampsia. The aim of this paper was to assess the correlations between the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio values within the <38, 38-85 and >85 brackets and perinatal outcomes in pregnancies that require determination of these markers. Methods A total of 927 pregnant patients between 18 and 41 weeks' gestation suspected of or confirmed with any form of placental insufficiency (preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction [IUGR], gestational hypertension, HELLP syndrome, placental abruption) were included in the study. In each of the patients, the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio was calculated. Patients were divided into three groups according to the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio brackets of <38, 38-85 and >85. Results Significantly worse perinatal outcomes were found in the sFlt-1/PlGF >85 group, primarily with lower cord blood pH, neonatal birth  and shorter duration of gestation. Statistically significant correlations between the values of these markers and the abovementioned perinatal effects were found. Conclusion An sFlt-1/PlGF ratio value of >85 suggests that either preeclampsia or one of the other placental insufficiency forms may occur, which is associated with lower cord blood pH, newborn  and earlier delivery. Determining the disordered angiogenesis markers and calculating the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio in pregnancies complicated by placental insufficiency may lead to better diagnosis, therapeutic decisions and better perinatal outcomes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30879763>Transfection of Sox11 plasmid alleviates ventilator-induced lung injury via Sox11 and FAK.</a></h1><p>Background Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is the most common complication in the mechanical ventilation in clinic. The pathogenesis of VILI has not been well understood. The SRY related High Mobility Group box group-F family member 11(Sox11) is a protein associated with lung development. The focal adhesion kinase(FAK) is a cytoplasmic  kinase and is regulated by Sox11. The present study, therefore, was undertaken to explore the potential role of Sox11 and FAK in VILI. Methods High volume mechanical ventilation(HMV) was used to establish mouse VILI model under anesthesia. The lung injury was evaluated by analyzing the lung , bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, histopathological changes and apoptosis of the lung. The Sox11 and FAK expressions in the lung were investigated by real-time qPCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis. Results HMV induced VILI simultaneously companied with decreased expressions of Sox11 and FAK in alveolar epithelial and interstitial cells either in gene and protein levels. Transfection of Sox11 plasmid significantly upregulated expressions of Sox11 and FAK in gene and protein levels in the lung and particularly effectively alleviated VILI. Furthermore, FAK antagonism by PF562271(FAK antagonist) blocked the alleviating effect of Sox11 plasmid transfection on the VILI. Conclusion The dysregulation in the Sox11 and FAK after HMV play an important role in the pathogenesis of VILI, and facilitating the activity of Sox11and FAK might be an effective target and potential option in the prevention and treatment of VILI in clinic.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

HPLC-MS was used to detect dopamine (DA), 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and glutamate (Glu) levels in the striatum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The amino acid level in the striatum and CSF was measured by HPLC-FLD. Protein expression of growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43) and neurofilament heavy polypeptide (NF-H) was measured using western blotting. The components of PAEs through blood vessels were detected by HPLC/MS/MS. In this study, PAEs with proteins ranging from 10 kDa to 250 kDa molecular  was administered to 6-OHDA-induced PD rats. We found that PAEs inhibited 6-OHDA-induced neuronal cell death and TH-positive neuronal loss in SNc. PAEs administration also increased the levels of DA, DOPAC, and 5-HT, in addition to DOPAC/DA and HVA/DA indexes in the CSF and Striatum of 6-OHDA induced rats. Conversely, PAEs decreased the levels of Glu and GABA. Treatment with PAEs and Madopar increased GAP-43 and NF-H expression in the SNc and striatum. Proteomic analysis using LC/MS/MS indicated that 11 components of PAEs may have neuropharmacological effects. These results demonstrate that PAEs protects against 6-OHDA induced toxic effects in the PD rat models. Intragastric administration of PAEs may be a novel therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative disorders like PD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644648>Effect of replacing fish meal by full fat soybean meal on growth performance, feed utilization and gastrointestinal enzymes in diets for African catfish Clarias gariepinus.</a></h1><p>Study aimed to evaluate the effect of replacing fish meal with different levels of full fat soybean meal (FFSBM) on growth and digestive enzyme activities in the stomach, Liver and intestine for Clarias gariepinus. Four diets (D1, D2, D3 and D4) were formulated with 0, 15, 20 and 20 g 100-1 protein + DL-methionine by alternating FFSBM with fish meal. The growth of C. gariepinus was found to be significantly decreased when FFSBM replacement increased. Final  was 89.69, 79.70, 70.82 and 68.29 g for fish fed on D1, D2, D3 and D4, respectively, with significant differences between treatments. Specific growth rate (SGR) ranged between 3.11 to 2.78%. Proteolytic activity was higher only with alkaline pHs, whereas only very low activity was shown with acidic. Results of liver showed approximately similar results at acid and alkaline. In contrast, higher proteolytic activity in the stomach was observed at acid pHs 3.0 and 4.0 μg -1 minute-1 mg-1 protein) whereas lower values were observed at neutral pH 7.0 g -1 minute-1 mg-1 protein for catfish fed on the experimental diets. Moreover, trypsin activity was higher for the stomach, followed by the intestine and liver.

The upper reference limit for the autoantibodies made by the manufacture was established on an adult Chinese population. Here, we established upper reference limits for Northern European adults and children in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Serum samples from healthy Danish children (0-18 years) and adults (18-70 years) were analysed for GAD65Ab and IA-2Ab using MAGLUMI 800 Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (CLIA). The Kruskal-Wallis test was used for evaluating differences between gender and age groups. No gender or age differences were found for neither GAD65Ab nor IA-2Ab, and a combined upper reference limit for both children and adults could be established. An upper reference limit of 5.1 IU/mL was defined for GAD65Ab and 11.5 U/mL for IA-2Ab. Our results showed a substantial discrepancy with the reference limits established by the manufacturer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31090865>Expression of neurotrophins and their receptors in primary osteosarcoma.</a></h1><p>to determine the expression of neurotrophins and their -kinase receptors in patients with osteosarcoma (OS) and their correlation with clinical outcomes.we applied immunohistochemistry to biopsy specimens of patients consecutively treated for primary OS at a single institution between 2002 and 2015, analyzing them for expression receptors of  kinase A and B (TrKA and TrKB), neural growth factor (NGF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Independently, two pathologists classified the immunohistochemical markers as negative (negative or weak focal) or positive (moderate focal/diffuse or strong focal/diffuse).we analyzed data from 19 patients (10 females and 9 males), with median age of 12 years (5 to 17.3). Tumors' location were 83.3% in the lower limbs, and 63.2% of patients had metastases at diagnosis. Five-year overall survival was 55.3%. BDNF was positive in 16 patients (84%) and NGF in 14 (73%). TrKA and TrKB presented positive staining in four (21,1%) and eight (42,1%) patients, respectively. Survival analysis showed no significant difference between TrK receptors and neurotrophins.primary OS samples express neurotrophins and TrK receptors by immunohistochemistry.

Cocoa has anti-diabetic effects by lowering glucose levels. However, whether cocoa exerts beneficial effects on the renal cortex glucose homeostasis and the molecular mechanisms responsible for this possible protective activity remain largely unknown. Thus, the potential anti-diabetic properties of cocoa on insulin signalling, glucose transporters and gluconeogenic enzymes were evaluated in the renal cortex of Zucker Diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Male ZDF rats were fed a control or cocoa-rich diet (10%), and Zucker Lean animals received the control diet. ZDF rats supplemented with cocoa (ZDF-Co) showed decreased  gain, glucose and insulin levels, improved glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and structural alterations in renal cortex. Moreover, cocoa-rich diet ameliorated insulin resistance by reverting decreased -phosphorylated-insulin receptor levels and by preventing the inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3/glycogen synthase pathway (GSK-3/GS) in the renal cortex of ZDF-Co rats. Cocoa antihyperglycaemic effect also appeared to be mediated through the diminution of phosphoenolpyruvate-carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase), sodium-glucose-co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2), and glucose-transporter-2 (GLUT-2) levels in ZDF-Co rat's renal cortex. These findings demonstrate that cocoa alleviates renal injury by contributing to maintain the glucose homeostasis in type 2 diabetic ZDF rats.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We have established a reactive sulfur metabolomics analysis by using RSS metabolic profiling, which revealed appreciable amounts of RSS generated endogenously and ubiquitously in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. The chemical nature of these polysulfides is not fully understood, however, because of their reactive or complicated redox-active properties. In our study here, we determined that  and a hydroxyphenyl-containing derivative, β-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl iodoacetamide (HPE-IAM), had potent stabilizing effects on diverse polysulfide residues formed in CysSSH-related low-molecular- species, e.g., glutathione polysulfides (oxidized glutathione trisulfide and oxidized glutathione tetrasulfide). The protective effect against degradation was likely caused by the inhibitory activity of hydroxyphenyl residues of  and HPE-IAM against alkaline hydrolysis of polysulfides. This hydrolysis occurred via heterolytic scission triggered by the hydroxyl anion acting on polysulfides that are cleaved into thiolates and sulfenic acids, with the hydrolysis being enhanced by alkylating reagents (e.g. IAM) and dimedone. Moreover,  prevented electrophilic degradation occurring in alkaline pH. The polysulfide stabilization induced by  or the hydroxyphenyl moiety of HPE-IAM will greatly improve our understanding of the chemical properties of polysulfides and may benefit the sulfur metabolomics analysis if it can be applied successfully to any kind of biological samples, including clinical specimens.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Phosphotyrosyl (pTyr) residues embedded in peptide motifs comprise minimal recognition elements that determine the substrate specificity of protein  phosphatases (PTPases). We incorporated aminooxy-containing amino acid residues into a 7-residue epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) derived phosphotyrosine-containing peptide and subjected the peptides to solution-phase oxime diversification by reacting with aldehyde-bearing druglike functionalities. The pTyr residue remained unmodified. The resulting derivatized peptide library was printed in microarrays on nitrocellulose-coated glass surfaces for assessment of PTPase catalytic activity or on gold monolayers for analysis of kinetic interactions by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Focusing on amino acid positions and chemical features, we first analyzed dephosphorylation of the peptide pTyr residues within the microarrayed library by the human dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSP) DUSP14 and DUSP22, as well as by PTPases from poxviruses (VH1) and Yersinia pestis (YopH). In order to identify the highest affinity oxime motifs, the binding interactions of the most active derivatized phosphopeptides were examined by SPR using noncatalytic PTPase mutants. On the basis of high-affinity oxime fragments identified by the two-step catalytic and SPR-based microarray screens, low-molecular- nonphosphate-containing peptides were designed to inhibit PTP catalysis at low micromolar concentrations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30820987>Tuning the Product Spectrum of a Glycoside Hydrolase Enzyme by a Combination of Site-Directed Mutagenesis and -Specific Chemical Modification.</a></h1><p>Selective chemical modification of proteins plays a pivotal role for the rational design of enzymes with novel and specific functionalities. In this study, a strategic combination of genetic and chemical engineering paves the way for systematic construction of biocatalysts by tuning the product spectrum of a levansucrase from Bacillus megaterium (Bm-LS), which typically produces small levan-like oligosaccharides. The implementation of site-directed mutagenesis followed by a -specific modification enabled control of the product synthesis: depending on the position, the modification provoked either enrichment of short oligosaccharides (up to 800 % in some cases) or triggered the formation of high molecular  polymer. The chemical modification can recover polymerization ability in variants with defective oligosaccharide binding motifs. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations provided insights into the effect of modifying non-native  residues on product specificity.© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, no studies have been conducted with single compound administration of SpiA. To verify the laxative effects and mechanism of action of SpiA on chronic constipation, we investigated alterations in the excretion parameters, histological structure, and cholinergic regulation of the enteric nerve in the colons of Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice with loperamide (Lop)-induced constipation after exposure to 20 mg/kg of SpiA. Decrease in the number,  and water contents of stools in the Lop+Vehicle treated group significantly recovered after SpiA treatment, and alterations in the histological structure and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were improved in the Lop+SpiA treated group. Similar recovery effects were observed in the ability for mucin secretion and expression of the membrane water channel gene (aquaporin 8, AQP8). Furthermore, significant improvements were observed in the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and acetylcholine receptors' (AChRs) downstream signaling pathway after treatment of SpiA. The levels of gastrointestinal (GI) hormones including cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin were also remarkably enhanced in the Lop+SpiA treated group as compared to the Lop+Vehicle treated group. The expression of receptor  kinase (C-kit) and protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5) in Cajal and neural cells, as well as the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) in smooth muscle cells, were recovered after SpiA exposure. Taken together, the results of the present study provide the first strong evidence that SpiA improves chronic constipation through muscarinic cholinergic regulation of the enteric nerve in a Lop-induced constipation ICR mice model.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31285418>Antitumorigenic and antiangiogenic efficacy of apatinib in liver cancer evaluated by multimodality molecular imaging.</a></h1><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Sorafenib is the standard first-line treatment for advanced HCC, but its efficacy is limited. Apatinib is a small-molecule  kinase inhibitor that has shown promising antitumor effects in gastric and non-small cell lung cancers in clinical trials, but there have been only a few studies reporting its anti-HCC effects in vitro and in HCC xenograft models. Hence, our present study systemically investigated and compared the antitumorigenic and antiangiogenic efficacy of apatinib and sorafenib in HCC in vitro and in vivo using multimodality molecular imaging, including bioluminescence imaging (BLI), bioluminescence tomography (BLT), fluorescence molecular imaging (FMI), and computed tomography angiography (CTA). Moreover, the safety and side effects of the two drugs were systemically evaluated. We found that apatinib showed a comparable therapeutic efficacy to sorafenib for the inhibition of HCC. The drug safety evaluation revealed that both of these drugs caused hypertension and mild liver and kidney damage. Sorafenib caused diarrhea, rash, and  loss in mice, but these effects were not observed in mice treated with apatinib. In conclusion, apatinib has similar antitumorigenic and antiangiogenic efficacy as sorafenib in HCC with less toxicity. These findings may provide preclinical evidence supporting the potential application of apatinib for the treatment of HCC patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30930994>Inhibition of tumor growth and angiogenesis of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells by ruxolitinib, a selective JAK2 inhibitor.</a></h1><p>Tamoxifen (TAM) is the most widely used treatment for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, the majority of these patients exhibit TAM resistance following treatment. We previously reported that proliferation and migration were greater in TAM-resistant MCF-7 (TAMR-MCF-7) cells than in parental MCF-7 cells. Janus kinases (JAKs) are cytosolic  kinases that transduce signals from plasma membrane cytokines and growth factor receptors. JAK2 selectively phosphorylates signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3, and the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway is known as a crucial signaling pathway for the regulation of cancer progression and metastasis. In the present study, basal phosphorylation of STAT3 was revealed to be greater in TAMR-MCF-7 cells than in control MCF-7 cells. Ruxolitinib, a potent JAK2 inhibitor, was demonstrated to attenuate STAT3 phosphorylation and the proliferation of TAMR-MCF-7 cells. Ruxolitinib also suppressed the enhanced cell migration of TAMR-MCF-7 cells through the inhibition of epithelial mesenchymal transition. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a representative target gene of the JAK2-STAT3 pathway, functions as a key regulator of invasion and angiogenesis. Ruxolitinib significantly inhibited VEGF mRNA expression and transcriptional activity. The present study also performed a chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay to assess tumor growth and angiogenesis in TAMR-MCF-7 cells. Ruxolitinib reduced tumor  and the number of blood vessels produced by TAMR-MCF-7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. These results indicated that JAK2 could be a new therapeutic target for TAM-resistant breast cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634391>All-trans Retinoic Acid Counteracts Diarrhea and Inhibition of Downregulated in Adenoma Expression in Gut Inflammation.</a></h1><p>Intestinal epithelial apical membrane Cl-/HCO3- exchanger DRA (downregulated in adenoma, SLC26A3) has emerged as an important therapeutic target for diarrhea, emphasizing the potential therapeutic role of agents that upregulate DRA. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a key vitamin A metabolite, was earlier shown by us to stimulate DRA expression in intestinal epithelial cells. However, its role in modulating DRA in gut inflammation has not been investigated.Our aim was to analyze the efficacy of ATRA in counteracting inflammation-induced decrease in DRA in vitro and in vivo.Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-treated Caco-2 cells and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated C57BL/6J mice served as in vitro and in vivo models of gut inflammation, respectively. The effect of ATRA on IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of DRA function, expression, and promoter activity were elucidated. In the DSS colitis model, diarrheal phenotype, cytokine response, in vivo imaging, myeloperoxidase activity, and DRA expression were measured in the distal colon.All-trans retinoic acid (10 μM, 24 h) abrogated IFN-γ (30 ng/mL, 24 h)-induced decrease in DRA function, expression, and promoter activity in Caco-2 cells. All-trans retinoic acid altered IFN-γ signaling via blocking IFN-γ-induced  phosphorylation of STAT-1. All-trans retinoic acid cotreatment (1 mg/kg BW, i.p. daily) of DSS-treated mice (3% in drinking water for 7 days) alleviated colitis-associated  loss, diarrheal phenotype, and induction of IL-1β and CXCL1 and a decrease in DRA mRNA and protein levels in the colon.Our data showing upregulation of DRA under normal and inflammatory conditions by ATRA demonstrate a novel role of this micronutrient in alleviating IBD-associated diarrhea.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Current therapeutic approaches, either pancreatic lipase inhibitors or appetite suppressors, are generally of limited effectiveness. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) and beige cells dissipate fatty acids as heat to maintain  temperature, termed non-shivering thermogenesis; the activity and mass of BAT and beige cells are negatively correlated with overweight and obesity. The existence of BAT and beige cells in human adults provides an effective  reduction therapy, a process likely to be amenable to pharmacological intervention. Herein, we combed through the physiology of thermogenesis and the role of BAT and beige cells in combating with obesity. We summarized the thermogenic regulators identified in the past decades, targeting G protein-coupled receptors, transient receptor potential channels, nuclear receptors and miscellaneous pathways. Advances in clinical trials were also presented. The main purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge from the biological importance of thermogenesis in energy homeostasis to the representative thermogenic regulators for treating obesity. Thermogenic regulators might have a large potential for further investigations to be developed as lead compounds in fighting obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612814>In silico Characterization of a Candidate Protein from Aphid Gelling Saliva with Potential for Aphid Control in Plants.</a></h1><p>Sheath or gelling saliva, secreted during feeding by aphids, is a hard material that supports the piercing mouthparts and remains in the plant after feeding. Solidification or gelling of the saliva might be due to the composition of amino acids in the constituent proteins, many of which probably interact with plant defenses.The complete complement of proteins in the gelling saliva are still unknown, although one sheath protein (SHP) has previously been identified as a potential candidate protein to control aphid feeding, but its structure and its physiochemical role remains obscure. The current study provides structural information and biochemical properties of the aphid sheath protein.Sheath protein encoding gene was amplified from cDNA of the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) through PCR using specific gene primers. Sequence was in silico characterized by using EXPASY, Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) Neural Network Promoter Prediction, BioEdit, Mega7, ProtParam, Phyre server, 3D LigandSite SMART, MEME and GSDS programs, available online.BLASTp results showed that the sequenced gene was identical (100%) to the sequence from Acyrthosiphon pisum, with 87% identity to Metpolophium dirhodum and 84% identity to Sitobion avenae. Phylogenetically monocot feeders such as M. dirhodum and S. avenae are in a sister taxa to dicot feeders. In silico analysis of the sequence revealed that sheath protein has a molecular  of 144 kDa and 50% of the protein is composed of only six amino acids, i.e., threonine, serine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, isoleucine and . The computed IP value revealed that sheath protein is acidic in nature. Ligand binding sites for sheath protein were predicted on residues 1123 and 1125 (isoleucine and glutamine, respectively). Metallic heterogens are also present in sheath protein that are iron, zinc and magnesium, respectively.It is conceivable that variation in the salivary gene sequences may reveal important biological information of relevance to the insect-plant interaction. Further exploration of insect salivary proteins, their composition and structure will provide powerful information, especially when these proteins are interacting with plant proteins, and specific information about the sheath protein, which is interacting with plants at a molecular/cellular level, will be important to progress strategies aimed specifically against sucking pests such as aphids.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30608967>High-fat diet accelerates extreme obesity with hyperphagia in female heterozygous Mecp2-null mice.</a></h1><p>Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutation of the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene. Although RTT has been associated with obesity, the underlying mechanism has not yet been elucidated. In this study, female heterozygous Mecp2-null mice (Mecp2+/- mice), a model of RTT, were fed a normal chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD), and the changes in molecular signaling pathways were investigated. Specifically, we examined the expression of genes related to the hypothalamus and dopamine reward circuitry, which represent a central network of feeding behavior control. In particular, dopamine reward circuitry has been shown to regulate hedonic feeding behavior, and its disruption is associated with HFD-related changes in palatability. The Mecp2+/- mice that were fed the normal chow showed normal  and food consumption, whereas those fed the HFD showed extreme obesity with hyperphagia, an increase of  fat mass, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance compared with wild-type mice fed the HFD (WT-HFD mice). The main cause of obesity in Mecp2+/--HFD mice was a remarkable increase in calorie intake, with no difference in oxygen consumption or locomotor activity. Agouti-related peptide mRNA and protein levels were increased, whereas proopiomelanocortin mRNA and protein levels were reduced in Mecp2+/--HFD mice with hyperleptinemia, which play an essential role in appetite and satiety in the hypothalamus. The conditioned place preference test revealed that Mecp2+/- mice preferred the HFD.  hydroxylase and dopamine transporter mRNA levels in the ventral tegmental area, and dopamine receptor and dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein mRNA levels in the nucleus accumbens were significantly lower in Mecp2+/--HFD mice than those of WT-HFD mice. Thus, HFD feeding induced dysregulation of food intake in the hypothalamus and dopamine reward circuitry, and accelerated the development of extreme obesity associated with addiction-like eating behavior in Mecp2+/- mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31053959>Sex and puberty-related differences in metabolomic profiles associated with adiposity  in youth with obesity.</a></h1><p>Specific patterns of metabolomic profiles relating to cardiometabolic disease are associated with increased  in adults.

Baseline plasma perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), and the plasma metabolome were measured by liquid-chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the association between baseline PFASs and changes in glucose homeostasis over follow-up. A metabolome-wide association study coupled with pathway enrichment analysis was performed to evaluate metabolic dysregulation associated with plasma PFASs concentrations. We performed a structural integrated analysis aiming to characterize the joint impact of all factors and to identify latent clusters of children with alterations in glucose homeostasis, based on their exposure and metabolomics profile.Each ln (ng/ml) increase in PFOA and PFHxS concentrations was associated with a 30.6 mg/dL (95% CI: 8.8-52.4) and 10.2 mg/dL (95% CI: 2.7-17.7) increase in 2-hour glucose levels, respectively. A ln (ng/ml) increase in PFHxS concentrations was also associated with 17.8 mg/dL increase in the glucose area under the curve (95% CI: 1.5-34.1). Pathway enrichment analysis showed significant alterations of lipids (e.g., glycosphingolipids, linoleic acid, and de novo lipogenesis), and amino acids (e.g., aspartate and asparagine, , arginine and proline) in association to PFASs exposure. The integrated analysis identified a cluster of children with increased 2-h glucose levels over follow up, characterized by increased PFAS levels and altered metabolite patterns.This proof-of-concept analysis shows that higher PFAS exposure was associated with dysregulation of several lipid and amino acid pathways and longitudinal alterations in glucose homeostasis in Hispanic youth. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings and fully elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and signaling through its tropomyosin-related  kinase B (TrkB) receptor, represents one of the most promising therapeutic targets for treating depression. BDNF is a key regulator of neuroplasticity in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex, the dysfunction of which is considered to be the main pathophysiological hallmark of this disorder. BDNF itself has no favorable drug-like properties due to poor pharmacokinetics and possible adverse effects. The design of small, proteolytically stable BDNF mimetics might provide a useful approach for the development of therapeutic agents. Two small molecule BDNF mimetics with antidepressant-like activity have been reported, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone and the dimeric dipeptide mimetic of BDNF loop 4, GSB-106. The article reflects on the current literature on the role of BDNF as a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of depression and on the current advances in the development of small molecules on the base of this neurotrophin as potential antidepressants.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30955655>Effect of alkali concentration on digestibility and absorption characteristics of rice residue protein isolates and lysinoalanine.</a></h1><p>The effect of alkali concentration on the digestibility and absorption characteristics of rice residue protein isolates (RPI) and lysinoalanine (LAL) was studied. When NaOH concentration was 0.03 M, the in vitro digestibility of RPI reached a maximum, and when NaOH concentration was higher than 0.03 M, the in vitro digestibility decreased. Alkali treatment reduced the release of all amino acids, especially arginine, lysine, phenylalanine, , cysteine, and threonine. LAL only released 2.65-9.28% of the total LAL content, which was mainly combined with longer peptide chains, and the molecular  was mostly accumulated between 1000 Da and 3000 Da. The experimental model of rats in the small intestine perfusion showed that the high alkali concentration significantly reduced the absorption rate of RPI, and LAL had no specific absorption site in the small intestine of rats, and was not available for intestinal absorption.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Male and female mice were treated with daily intragastric administration of either  (Tyr; 420 μg/kg ), DT (420 μg/kg ), or OTPs (1909 μg/kg ) for 35 days. We found that pure DT and OTPs caused redox state imbalance, elevated levels of inflammatory factors, hippocampal oxidative damage, and neurotransmitter disorders while activating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in the hippocampus and downregulating the genes associated with learning and memory. These events eventually led to growing mice learning and memory impairment, lagging responses, and anxiety-like behaviors. Furthermore, the male mice exhibited slightly more oxidative damage than the females. These findings imply that contemporary diets and food-processing strategies of the modern world should be modified to reduce oxidized protein intake.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31274599>Lipid Emulsion Containing High Amounts of n3 Fatty Acids (Omegaven) as Opposed to n6 Fatty Acids (Intralipid) Preserves Insulin Signaling and Glucose Uptake in Perfused Rat Hearts.</a></h1><p>It is currently unknown whether acute exposure to n3 fatty acid-containing fish oil-based lipid emulsion Omegaven as opposed to the n6 fatty acid-containing soybean oil-based lipid emulsion Intralipid is more favorable in terms of insulin signaling and glucose uptake in the intact beating heart.Sprague-Dawley rat hearts were perfused in the working mode for 90 minutes in the presence of 11 mM glucose and 1.2 mM palmitate bound to albumin, the first 30 minutes without insulin followed by 60 minutes with insulin (50 mU/L). Hearts were randomly allocated to 100 µM Intralipid, 100 µM Omegaven, or no emulsion (insulin treatment alone) for 60 minutes. Glycolysis and glycogen synthesis were measured with the radioactive tracer [5-H]glucose, and glucose uptake was calculated. Phosphorylation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), protein kinase Akt, and phosphofructokinase (PFK)-2 was measured by immunoblotting. Glycolytic metabolites were determined by enzymatic assays. Mass spectrometry was used to establish acylcarnitine profiles. Nuclear factor κB (NFκB) nuclear translocation served as reactive oxygen species (ROS) biosensor.Insulin-mediated glucose uptake was decreased by Intralipid (4.9 ± 0.4 vs 3.7 ± 0.3 μmol/gram dry heart  [gdw]·min; P = .047) due to both reduced glycolysis and glycogen synthesis. In contrast, Omegaven treatment did not affect insulin-mediated glycolysis or glycogen synthesis and thus preserved glucose uptake (5.1 ± 0.3 vs 4.9 ± 0.4 μmol/gdw·min; P = .94). While Intralipid did not affect PP2A phosphorylation status, Omegaven resulted in significantly enhanced  phosphorylation and inhibition of PP2A. This was accompanied by increased selective threonine phosphorylation of Akt and the downstream target PFK-2 at S483. PFK-1 activity was increased when compared with Intralipid as measured by the ratio of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate (Omegaven 0.60 ± 0.11 versus Intralipid 0.47 ± 0.09; P = .023), consistent with increased formation of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate by PFK2, its main allosteric activator. Omegaven lead to accumulation of acylcarnitines and fostered a prooxidant response as evidenced by NFκB nuclear translocation and activation.Omegaven as opposed to Intralipid preserves glucose uptake via the PP2A-Akt-PFK pathway in intact beating hearts. n3 fatty acids decelerate β-oxidation causing accumulation of acylcarnitine species and a prooxidant response, which likely inhibits redox-sensitive PP2A and thus preserves insulin signaling and glucose uptake.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31392592>First Genome-wide Association Analysis for Growth Traits in the Largest Coral Reef-Dwelling Bony Fishes, the Giant Grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus).</a></h1><p>The giant grouper, Epinephelus lanceolatus, is the largest coral reef-dwelling bony fish species. However, despite extremely fast growth performance and the considerable economic importance in this species, its genetic regulation of growth remains unknown. Here, we performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) for five growth traits in 289 giant groupers using 42,323 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained by genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). We identified a total of 36 growth-related SNPs, of which 11 SNPs reached a genome-wide significance level. The phenotypic variance explained by these SNPs varied from 7.09% for  height to 18.42% for  length. Moreover, 22 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for growth traits, including nine significant QTLs and 13 suggestive QTLs, were found on multiple chromosomes. Interestingly, the QTL (LG17: 6934451) was shared between  and  height, while two significant QTLs (LG7: 22596399 and LG15: 11877836) for  length were consistent with the associated regions of total length at the genome-wide suggestive level. Eight potential candidate genes close to the associated SNPs were selected for expression analysis, of which four genes (phosphatidylinositol transfer protein cytoplasmic 1, protein  phosphatase receptor type E, alpha/beta hydrolase domain-containing protein 17C, and vascular endothelial growth factor A-A) were differentially expressed and involved in metabolism, development, response stress, etc. This study improves our understanding of the complex genetic architecture of growth in the giant grouper. The results contribute to the selective breeding of grouper species and the conservation of coral reef fishes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30830386>Global testing of shifts in metabolic phenotype.</a></h1><p>Current metabolomics approaches to unravel impact of diet- or lifestyle induced phenotype variation and shifts predominantly deploy univariate or multivariate approaches, with a posteriori interpretation at pathway level. This however often provides only a fragmented view on the involved metabolic pathways.To demonstrate the feasibility of using Goeman's global test (GGT) for assessment of variation and shifts in metabolic phenotype at the level of a priori defined pathways.Two intervention studies with identified phenotype variations and shifts were examined. In a  loss (WL) intervention study obese subjects received a mixed meal challenge before and after WL. In a polyphenol (PP) intervention study obese subjects received a high fat mixed meal challenge (61E% fat) before and after a PP intervention. Plasma samples were obtained at fasting and during the postprandial response. Besides WL- and PP-induced phenotype shifts, also correlation of plasma metabolome with phenotype descriptors was assessed at pathway level. The plasma metabolome covered organic acids, amino acids, biogenic amines, acylcarnitines and oxylipins.For the population of the WL study, GGT revealed that HOMA correlated with the fasting levels of the TCA cycle, BCAA catabolism, the lactate, arginine-proline and phenylalanine- pathways. For the population of the PP study, HOMA correlated with fasting metabolite levels of TCA cycle, fatty acid oxidation and phenylalanine- pathways. These correlations were more pronounced for metabolic pathways in the fasting state, than during the postprandial response. The effect of the WL and PP intervention on a priori defined metabolic pathways, and correlation of pathways with insulin sensitivity as described by HOMA was in line with previous studies.GGT confirmed earlier biological findings in a hypothesis led approach. A main advantage of GGT is that it provides a direct view on involvement of a priori defined pathways in phenotype shifts.ClinicalTrials.gov  .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620672>Serum Amino Acid Concentrations in Infants from Malawi are Associated with Linear Growth.</a></h1><p>Serum amino acid (AA) concentrations are correlated with childhood stunting, but their relation to linear growth velocity has not been explored. This was a secondary analysis of a clinical trial where Malawian infants aged 6-12 mo were given a legume supplement providing 8.2 g/d of protein; anthropometry was conducted at multiple intervals, and fasted serum AA concentrations were measured at 12 mo of age. Lysine, proline, tryptophan, , and valine concentrations were higher in infants with a linear growth velocity -score >0 than those <0. Corrected Spearman correlation coefficients between individual AA concentrations and -for-height and length velocity from 6 to 12 mo of age were positively correlated for glycine, isoleucine, proline, serine, threonine, , and valine.

These studies tested the hypothesis that maternal obesity alters signaling pathways during the course of lung development that may affect life-long pulmonary health. Adult female mice were fed 60% fat [high-fat diet (HFD)] or 10% fat [control diet (CD)] for 8 wk before mating and through weaning. Pup lung tissues were collected at  () , , and  (after receiving HFD or CD as adults). At ,   from HFD were greater than CD but lung -to- ratios were lower. In lung tissues, NFκB-mediated inflammation was greater in HFD pups at  and phospho-/total STAT3, phospho-/total VEGF receptor 2, and total AKT protein levels were lower with maternal HFD and protein  phosphatase B1 levels were increased. Decreased platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule levels were observed at  and at  in the pups exposed to maternal HFD. Morphometry indicated that the pups exposed to maternal or adult HFD had fewer alveoli, and the effect was additive. Decreases in pulmonary resistance, elastance, and compliance were observed because of adult HFD diet and decreases in airway resistance and increases in inspiratory capacity because of maternal HFD. In conclusion, maternal HFD disrupts signaling pathways in the early developing lung and may contribute to deficiencies in lung function and increased susceptibility in adults.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034925>The small members of the JMJD protein family: Enzymatic jewels or jinxes?</a></h1><p>Jumonji C domain-containing (JMJD) proteins are mostly epigenetic regulators that demethylate histones. However, a hitherto neglected subfamily of JMJD proteins, evolutionarily distant and characterized by their relatively small molecular , exerts different functions by hydroxylating proteins and RNA. Recently, unsuspected proteolytic and  kinase activities were also ascribed to some of these small JMJD proteins, further increasing their enzymatic versatility. Here, we discuss the ten human small JMJD proteins (HIF1AN, HSPBAP1, JMJD4, JMJD5, JMJD6, JMJD7, JMJD8, RIOX1, RIOX2, TYW5) and their diverse physiological functions. In particular, we focus on the roles of these small JMJD proteins in cancer and other maladies and how they are modulated in diseased cells by an altered metabolic milieu, including hypoxia, reactive oxygen species and oncometabolites. Because small JMJD proteins are enzymes, they are amenable to inhibition by small molecules and may represent novel targets in the therapy of cancer and other diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The formation of toxic amyloid oligomers, extracellular amyloid plaques and amyloid angiopathy in brain by amyloid beta peptides are considered a part of the identified mechanism involved in disease pathogenesis. The optimal treatment approach leads toward finding a chemical compound able to form a noncovalent complex with the amyloid peptide thus blocking the process of amyloid aggregation. This direction gained an increasing interest lately, many studies demonstrating that mass spectrometry is a valuable method useful for the identification and characterization of such molecules able to interact with amyloid peptides. In the present review we aim to identify in the scientific literature low molecular  chemical compounds for which there is mass spectrometric evidence of noncovalent complex formation with amyloid peptides and also there are toxicity reduction results which verify the effects of these compounds on amyloid beta toxicity towards cell cultures and transgenic mouse models developing Alzheimer's Disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625033>Role of JAM-A  phosphorylation in epithelial barrier dysfunction during intestinal inflammation.</a></h1><p>Junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A), an epithelial tight junction protein, plays an important role in regulating intestinal permeability through association with a scaffold signaling complex containing ZO-2, Afadin, and the small GTPase Rap2. Under inflammatory conditions, we report that the cytoplasmic tail of JAM-A is  phosphorylated (p-Y280) in association with loss of barrier function. While barely detectable Y280 phosphorylation was observed in confluent monolayers of human intestinal epithelial cells under basal conditions, exposure to cytokines TNFα, IFNγ, IL-22, or IL-17A, resulted in compromised barrier function in parallel with increased p-Y280. Phosphorylation was Src kinase dependent, and we identified Yes-1 and PTPN13 as a major kinase and phosphatase for p-JAM-A Y280, respectively. Moreover, cytokines IL-22 or IL-17A induced increased activity of Yes-1. Furthermore, the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 rescued cytokine-induced epithelial barrier defects and inhibited phosphorylation of JAM-A Y280 in vitro. Phosphorylation of JAM-A Y280 and increased permeability correlated with reduced JAM-A association with active Rap2. Finally, we observed increased phosphorylation of Y280 in colonic epithelium of individuals with ulcerative colitis and in mice with experimentally induced colitis. These findings support a novel mechanism by which  phosphorylation of JAM-A Y280 regulates epithelial barrier function during inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30638738>Essential amino acid-enriched meal replacement promotes superior net protein balance in older, overweight adults.</a></h1><p>Older individuals are susceptible to the loss of muscle and accumulation of fat. To address this problem, we have compared protein kinetics following consumption of an essential amino acid (EAA)-enriched meal replacement (EMR) to consumption of a high-protein meal replacement beverage (Bariatric Advantage, BA) using stable isotope methodology.Eight older (67 ± 2), obese (35 ± 2 kg/m) female and male participants completed two studies using a randomized, crossover design in which they ingested each meal replacement. The isotopic tracers L-[H]phenylalanine & L-[H] were delivered via primed, continuous intravenous infusion throughout a basal period and following consumption of EMR or BA. We determined changes in whole  protein synthesis (PS), protein breakdown (PB), and net protein balance (NB) from fasted states via analysis of plasma samples by LC-ESI-MS.PS was higher (P = 0.03) and PB was less (P = 0.005) with EMR in comparison to BA. As a result, NB was much greater (P = 0.00003) following the ingestion of EMR as compared to BA.In comparison with BA, which has a higher amount of intact protein that any other meal replacement, EMR promoted a greater increment in NB. These data support the potential efficacy of EMR as a meal replacement for the preservation of lean tissue mass during  loss in older, overweight individuals.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Overexpression is correlated with tau hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study assessed the potential of SM07883, an oral DYRK1A inhibitor, to inhibit tau hyperphosphorylation, aggregation, NFT formation, and associated phenotypes in mouse models. Exploratory neuroinflammatory effects were also studied. SM07883 specificity was tested in a kinase panel screen and showed potent inhibition of DYRK1A (IC  = 1.6 nM) and GSK-3β (IC  = 10.8 nM) kinase activity. Tau phosphorylation measured in cell-based assays showed a reduction in phosphorylation of multiple tau epitopes, especially the threonine 212 site (EC  = 16 nM). SM07883 showed good oral bioavailability in multiple species and demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction of transient hypothermia-induced phosphorylated tau in the brains of wild-type mice compared to vehicle (47%, p < 0.001). Long-term efficacy assessed in aged JNPL3 mice overexpressing the P301L human tau mutation (3 mg/kg, QD, for 3 months) exhibited significant reductions in tau hyperphosphorylation, oligomeric and aggregated tau, and tau-positive inclusions compared to vehicle in brainstem and spinal cord samples. Reduced gliosis compared to vehicle was further confirmed by ELISA. SM07883 was well tolerated with improved general health,  gain, and functional improvement in a wire-hang test compared to vehicle-treated mice (p = 0.048). SM07883, a potent, orally bioavailable, brain-penetrant DYRK1A inhibitor, significantly reduced effects of pathological tau overexpression and neuroinflammation, while functional endpoints were improved compared to vehicle in animal models.

As a product of water chlorination and a metabolite of certain industrial chemicals, DCA is ubiquitous in our biosphere at low μg/kg  daily exposure levels without obvious adverse effects in humans. As an investigational drug for numerous congenital and acquired diseases, DCA is administered orally or parenterally, usually at doses of 10-50mg/kg per day. As a therapeutic, its principal mechanism of action is to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). In turn, PDK inhibits the key mitochondrial energy homeostat, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), by reversible phosphorylation. By blocking PDK, DCA activates PDC and, consequently, the mitochondrial respiratory chain and ATP synthesis. A reversible sensory/motor peripheral neuropathy is the clinically limiting adverse effect of chronic DCA exposure and experimental data implicate the Schwann cell as a toxicological target. It has been postulated that stimulation of PDC and respiratory chain activity by DCA in normally glycolytic Schwann cells causes uncompensated oxidative stress from increased reactive oxygen species production. Additionally, the metabolism of DCA interferes with the catabolism of the amino acids phenylalanine and  and with heme synthesis, resulting in accumulation of reactive molecules capable of forming adducts with DNA and proteins and also resulting in oxidative stress. Preliminary evidence in rodent models of peripheral neuropathy suggest that DCA-induced neurotoxicity may be mitigated by naturally occurring antioxidants and by a specific class of muscarinic receptor antagonists. These findings generate a number of testable hypotheses regarding the etiology and treatment of DCA peripheral neuropathy.© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Behavior activity, stool volume and open-field test were recorded during the injection. Colonic propulsion rate was measured 6 weeks after rotenone injection. Colon samples of all rats were collected for the measurement of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein, choline acetyltransferase (CHAT), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and  hydroxylase (TH). The protocols of control rats were the same as the PD rats except that no electrodes were implanted and no rotenone was injected.(1) Rotenone-induced PD rats demonstrated  loss, significant decrease of the dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra, and impairment of colon movement. (2) CES significantly accelerated the delayed colonic transmit (91.67 ± 5.58% vs 51.33 ± 4.18%), superior to Macrogol-4000.

Mutations in the  or the TrkB-encoding  gene have been found to cause severe obesity in humans and mice. However, it remains unknown which brain neurons express TrkB to control . Here, we report that TrkB-expressing neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) regulate food intake. We found that the DMH contains both glutamatergic and GABAergic TrkB-expressing neurons, some of which also express the leptin receptor (LepR). As revealed by Fos immunohistochemistry, a significant number of TrkB-expressing DMH (DMH) neurons were activated upon either overnight fasting or after refeeding. Chemogenetic activation of DMH neurons strongly suppressed feeding in the dark cycle when mice are physiologically hungry, whereas chemogenetic inhibition of DMH neurons greatly promoted feeding in the light cycle when mice are physiologically satiated, without affecting feeding in the dark cycle. Neuronal tracing revealed that DMH neurons do not innervate neurons expressing agouti-related protein in the arcuate nucleus, indicating that DMH neurons are distinct from previously identified LepR-expressing GABAergic DMH neurons that suppress feeding. Furthermore, selective  deletion in the DMH of adult mice led to hyperphagia, reduced energy expenditure, and obesity. Thus, our data show that DMH neurons are a population of neurons that are necessary and sufficient to suppress appetite and maintain physiological satiation. Pharmacological activation of these neurons could be a therapeutic intervention for the treatment of obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31548004>GLP-1 and PYY reduce high-fat food preference additively after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in diet-induced obese rats.</a></h1><p>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) modifies various aspects of eating behavior in morbidly obese individuals to cause marked and lasting  loss and improvements in metabolic health, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.To assess the relative contributions of the gut hormones glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide   3-36 (PYY), whose circulating levels are enhanced by RYGB, in the reduced high-fat (HF) food preference that develops postoperatively.University hospital, Würzburg, Germany.HF diet-induced obese male Wistar rats underwent RYGB (n = 11) or sham (n = 7) surgeries and were subsequently maintained on a choice of low-fat (10% calories from fat) and HF (60% calories from fat) diets. From postoperative weeks 4 to 6, acute feeding studies were performed in which the selective GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin-9 (30 μg/kg), the second-generation selective Y2 receptor antagonist JNJ-31020028 (10 mg/kg), or a combination of both drugs was administered intraperitoneally.During the observational period , adiposity and total food intake were lower while postprandial plasma GLP-1 and peptide   levels were higher for RYGB-operated compared with sham-operated rats. There was a gradual shift in preference from HF to low-fat food in RYGB-operated rats by postoperative week 3. Single antagonist treatments had a relatively modest impact on HF food preference in rats from both surgical groups. However, dual antagonist treatment caused a striking increase in HF food preference specifically in RYGB-operated rats.GLP-1 and peptide   3-36 reduce HF food preference additively after RYGB supporting the use of gut hormone combination strategies for healthier feeding behavior.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Bariatric Surgery.

Here we establish age-specific continuous reference intervals for catecholamine O-methylated metabolites in children evaluated for catecholamine producing tumors, particularly younger children with suspected neuroblastoma.Plasma concentrations of 3-methoxytyramine, normetanephrine, metanephrine, and 3-O-methyldopa were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in 533 children aged 2 days to 18 years.Concentrations of plasma free normetanephrine, 3-methoxytyramine and 3-O-methyldopa were higher in neonates up until six months of age, but thereafter declined steeply to levels after one year that were <38% those of neonatal concentrations and to further lower concentrations in teenagers that were <23% those in neonates. In contrast, concentrations of plasma free metanephrine showed a reciprocal pattern with 50% lower concentrations in infants below one year compared to later in childhood.The dynamic reciprocal changes in plasma concentrations of normetanephrine, 3-methoxytyramine and 3-O-methyldopa compared to metanephrine during early childhood suggest underlying developmental changes in extra-adrenal and adrenal chromaffin tissue that must be considered for pediatric reference intervals, particularly in infants.

Indeed, it is unknown whether the mechanism of IR in PCOS is mediated through changes in the metabolome.  Twelve women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and ten age and  mass index matched controls completed an 8 week supervised exercise program at 60% maximal oxygen consumption. Before and after the exercise program, all participants underwent maximal IR stimulation with intralipid infusions followed by insulin sensitivity (IS) measurement by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamps. Amino acid profiles and metabolites were taken at baseline and at maximal insulin resistance stimulation before and after the exercise program.  At baseline, PCOS subjects showed increased leucine/isoleucine, glutamate, methionine, ornithine, phenylalanine,  and proline ( < 0.05) that, following exercise, did not differ from controls. While compering within the groups, no significant changes in the amino acid levels before and after exercise were observed. Exercise improved VO2 max ( < 0.01) but did not alter . Amino acid profiles were unaffected by an acute increase in IR induced by the lipid infusion. IS was lower in PCOS ( < 0.001) and was further decreased by the lipid infusion in both PCOS and controls. Although, exercise improved IS in both PCOS and in controls, the IS remained compromised in PCOS.

The results exhibited the effects of microwave irradiation on hydrolysis of ASC-Am with different protease. Neutrase was selected from the four common proteases (papain, pepsin, trypsin, and neutrase) based on the highest content and DPPH scavenging activity of hydrolysate Fa (Molecular  < 1 kDa). The content and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity of Fa obtained by hydrolysis of neutrase increased by 100% and 109% respectively at a microwave power of 300 W compared with no microwave irradiation. Five subfractions were obtained after performing the gel filtration chromatography, and the Fa.2 exhibited the highest DPPH scavenging activity. The amino acid analysis showed that the contents of Glutamic acid, Alanine, , and Phenylalanine in fraction Fa.2 increased significantly, but an obvious decrease in the content of Glycine was observed compared to Fa. Four peptides (Fa.2-A, Fa.2-B, Fa.2-C, and Fa.2-D) were purified from Fa.2 by high performance liquid chromatography, and Fa.2-C showed the highest DPPH scavenging activity. The sequence of Fa.2-C was identified as Phenylalanine-Leucine- Alanine-Proline with a half elimination ratio (EC) of 0.385 mg/mL. The antioxidant activity of Fa.2-C was probably attributed to the small molecular sizes and the presence of hydrophobic amino acid residues in its sequence.

At present, the impact of biogas slurry on the properties of organic matter in soil is not clear. In this study, a pot experiment in which chemical fertilizers were replaced with biogas slurry from a swine farm was performed. The fluorescence spectra combined with parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to explore the influence of biogas slurry on the protein and humic substance contents in the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soil. The results showed that there were two proteins (component 3 (C3) and component 4 (C4)) and two humic substances ( component 1 (C1) and component 2 (C2)) in the DOM of the experimental soil. The application of swine biogas slurry can significantly increase the content of DOM in soil, but the increase was weakened with extended time. Compared with the CKA, the biogas slurry significantly increased the C1, C2, C3 and C4 contents in the initial stage by 116.17%, 76.41%, 578.71% and 278.13%, respectively. Within 28 days of planting corn, proteins with simple molecular structure in the DOM in the soil began to be transformed into humic substances with high molecular  and more complex molecular structures. On the 60th day, the contents of C1 and C2 in the DOM of the treated treatments soil increased by 13.72%-34.40% and 5.05%-17.78% respectively, and  content decreased by 90.11%-94.41%. This study provides a new perspective on the effects of biogas slurry application on soil properties and sustainable utilization of soil.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Two challenging aspects are selective inhibition and cell permeability. A structure-based strategy was employed to develop uncharged bromophenols as a new series of PTP1B inhibitors. The most potent compound 22 (LXQ46) inhibited PTP1B with an IC value of 0.190 μM, and showed remarkable selectivity over other protein  phosphatases (PTPs, 20-200 folds). In the SPR study, increasing concentrations of compound 22 led to concentration-dependent increases in binding responses, indicating that compound 22 could bind to the surface of PTP1B via noncovalent means. By treating insulin-resistant C2C12 myotubes with compound 22, enhanced insulin and leptin signaling pathways were observed. Long-term oral administration of compound 22 reduced the blood glucose level of diabetic BKS db mice. The glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) and insulin tolerance tests (ITT) in BKS db mice showed that oral administration of compound 22 could increase insulin sensitivity. In addition, long-term oral administration of compound 22 could protect mice from obesity, which was not the result of toxicity. Our pharmacokinetics results from the rat-based assays showed that orally administered compound 22 was absorbed rapidly from the gastrointestinal tract, extensively distributed to the tissues, and rapidly eliminated from the . All these results indicate that compound 22 could serve as a qualified agent to treat type II diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We show that female mice genetically lacking protein  phosphatase (PTP) receptor type α (PTPRA) exhibit reduced  and adiposity and increased energy expenditure, and are more resistant to diet-induced obesity than matched wild-type control mice. These mice also exhibit reduced levels of circulating leptin and are leptin hypersensitive, suggesting that PTPRA inhibits leptin signaling in the hypothalamus. Male and female PTPRA-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet were leaner and displayed increased metabolic rates and lower circulating leptin levels, indicating that the effects of loss of PTPRA persist in the obese state. Molecularly, PTPRA down-regulates leptin receptor signaling by dephosphorylating the receptor-associated kinase JAK2, with which the phosphatase associates constitutively. In contrast to the closely related  phosphatase ε, leptin induces only weak phosphorylation of PTPRA at its C-terminal regulatory site Y789, and this does not affect the activity of PTPRA toward JAK2. PTPRA is therefore an inhibitor of hypothalamic leptin signaling in vivo and may prevent premature activation of leptin signaling, as well as return signaling to baseline after exposure to leptin.-Cohen-Sharir, Y., Kuperman, Y., Apelblat, D., den Hertog, J., Spiegel, I., Knobler, H., Elson, A.

A mutation in the deubiquitinase gene USP8 has been found in human ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma cells. This mutational hotspot hyperactivates USP8, rescuing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) from lysosomal degradation and ensuring its sustained signaling in Cushing's disease. An EGFR inhibitor would be an effective anti-tumor agent in EGFR-related tumors. We investigated the effect of a potent dual  kinase inhibitor, lapatinib, on ACTH production and cell proliferation in AtT-20 mouse corticotroph tumor cells. Lapatinib decreased proopiomelanocortin (Pomc) mRNA levels and ACTH levels in AtT-20 cells and also inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and decreased pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 (Pttg1), a hallmark of pituitary tumors, mRNA levels. KSN/Slc nude mice were subcutaneously inoculated with AtT-20 cells. After 1 week, the mice were randomized either to control or lapatinib groups. The inhibitor decreased the tumor  of AtT-20 allografts in vivo versus control mice. Lapatinib also significantly decreased Pomc and Pttg1 mRNA levels in the tumor and plasma ACTH and corticosterone levels in vivo. Thus, lapatinib decreases the ACTH production and proliferation of corticotroph tumor cells. An EGFR-targeting therapy could be an important treatment for Cushing's disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035194>Effects of copper ions on removal of nutrients from swine wastewater and on release of dissolved organic matter in duckweed systems.</a></h1><p>High concentration of Cu in swine wastewater raises concerns about its potential adverse effects on nutrient removal by aquatic plants like duckweed. In this work, the effects of copper ions on nutrient removal and release of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were investigated in duckweed systems. Results showed that the removal performance of ammonia nitrogen (NHN) and total phosphorus (TP) increased at 0.1-1.0 mg/L of Cu, while dropped at 2.0-5.0 mg/L of Cu. A novel kinetic model in which Cu was taken into account was then developed which was used to optimize Cu concentration at 0.96 mg/L for nutrient removal in duckweed systems. NADH, detected in DOM by the parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis, exhibited high capacities of binding copper ions, so it played an important role on the decrease of Cu concentrations in duckweed systems. The principle component analysis (PCA) showed that the dominant DOM were lower molecular  compounds at 1.0 mg/L of Cu and higher molecular  compounds at 2.0-5.0 mg/L of Cu. The bonds of CH (humic-like), NO (NO) and ArH () in DOM were responsible for not only the fastest binding with Cu from the result of the two-dimensional Fourier transform infrared correlation spectroscopy (2D-FTIR-CoS) but also the variations of DOM conformations at a critical concentration of 0.5 mg/L Cu from the perturbation correlation moving window two-dimensional (PCMW2D) analysis. These findings lead to a better understanding on the environmental behaviors and mechanisms of Cu in duckweed systems.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The small-molecule Wnt pathway inhibitor, lorecivivint (SM04690), which previously demonstrated chondrogenesis and cartilage protection in an animal OA model, was evaluated to elucidate its mechanism of action.Biochemical assays measured kinase activity. Western blots measured protein phosphorylation in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), chondrocytes, and synovial fibroblasts. siRNA knockdown effects in hMSCs and BEAS-2B cells on Wnt pathway, chondrogenic genes, and LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines was measured by qPCR. In vivo anti-inflammation, pain, and function were evaluated following single intra-articular (IA) lorecivivint or vehicle injection in the monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced rat OA model.Lorecivivint inhibited intranuclear kinases CDC-like kinase 2 (CLK2) and dual-specificity  phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A). Lorecivivint inhibited CLK2-mediated phosphorylation of serine/arginine-rich (SR) splicing factors and DYRK1A-mediated phosphorylation of SIRT1 and FOXO1. siRNA knockdowns identified a role for CLK2 and DYRK1A in Wnt pathway modulation without affecting β-catenin with CLK2 inhibition inducing early chondrogenesis and DYRK1A inhibition enhancing mature chondrocyte function. NF-κB and STAT3 inhibition by lorecivivint reduced inflammation. DYRK1A knockdown was sufficient for anti-inflammatory effects, while combined DYRK1A/CLK2 knockdown enhanced this effect. In the MIA model, lorecivivint inhibited production of inflammatory cytokines and cartilage degradative enzymes, resulting in increased joint cartilage, decreased pain, and improved -bearing function.Lorecivivint inhibition of CLK2 and DYRK1A suggested a novel mechanism for Wnt pathway inhibition, enhancing chondrogenesis, chondrocyte function, and anti-inflammation.

The selection of a suitable reference gene for normalization is critical for the accuracy of quantitative results. Peripheral nerve injury is a common clinical disorder that affects multiple tissues and organs, including peripheral nerves, neurons and the innervated muscles. Numerous genes are differentially expressed in skeletal muscles during muscle denervation and reinnervation following peripheral nerve injury. The identification of a suitable reference gene in innervated muscles following nerve injury may improve the understanding of the alterations in gene expression in the processes of peripheral nerve repair and regeneration. Therefore, in the present study, by using a rat sciatic nerve crush model, the expression levels of various housekeeping genes were examined. In particular, the expression levels of 13 housekeeping genes, including 18S ribosomal RNA, actin β, ankyrin repeat domain 27, cyclophilin A, GAPDH, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1), mitochondrial ribosomal protein L10, phosphoglycerate kinase 1, RPTOR independent companion of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2, TATA‑box binding protein, ubiquitin C, UBX domain protein 11 and  3‑monooxygenase/tryptophan 5‑monooxygenase activation protein ζ, were investigated in gastrocnemius muscles.

Therefore, HPRT1 may be used as a reference gene for the normalization of gene expression data generated by RT‑qPCR.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31421510>The characterization of dissolved organic matter in alkaline fermentation of sewage sludge with different pH for volatile fatty acids production.</a></h1><p>Sewage sludge (SS) alkaline fermentation (especially at pH 10) can efficiently enhance volatile fatty acids (VFAs) production. VFAs are considered an excellent carbon source for the biological nutrient removal (BNR) process. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in fermentation liquid is the direct substrate used for producing VFAs and can greatly influence the effluent quality of BNR process. However, knowledge of DOM characteristics in sludge alkaline fermentation is limited. This study focused on the functional groups, fluorescent components and molecular features of DOM as well as molecular  of proteins in SS alkaline fermentation (at pH uncontrolled, 7, 8, 9 and 10). Results showed a significantly improved generation of tryptophan-like and -like substances as well as molecular  <1 kDa proteins (381.5 ± 38.4 mg/L) was observed at pH 10 (p < 0.05). Further analysis of DOM molecular characteristics indicated that pH 10 resulted in the highest molecular diversity and the generation or degradation of easily biodegradable lipid-like and proteins/amino sugars-like formulas. The improved solubilization of DOM contributed to VFAs production. Meanwhile, increasing pH to 10 also promoted the release of hard-biodegradable organic matter, e.g., humic-like and lignin-like substances. Additionally, a high diversity of resistant N-containing organic molecules was generated at pH 10. Fermentation of SS at pH 10, is favored to enhance VFAs production and, can also result in a higher content of refractory DOM. This study helps to achieve a comprehensive understanding of SS alkaline fermentation and provides fundamental information for further treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of nerve damage and sensory loss remain largely unclear. Recently, alteration in metabolic flux has gained attention as a basis for organ damage in diabetes; however, peripheral sensory neurons have not been adequately analyzed with respect to metabolic dysfunction. In the present study, we attempted to delineate the sequence of event occurring in alteration of metabolic pathways in relation to nerve damage and sensory loss. C57Bl6/j wild-type mice were analyzed longitudinally up to 22 weeks in the streptozotocin (STZ) model of type 1 diabetes. The progression of DPN was investigated by behavioral measurements of sensitivity to thermal and mechanical stimuli and quantitative morphological assessment of intraepidermal nerve fiber density. We employed a mass spectrometry-based screen to address alterations in levels of metabolites in peripheral sciatic nerve and amino acids in serum over several months post-STZ administration to elucidate metabolic dysfunction longitudinally in relation to sensory dysfunction. Although hyperglycemia and  changes occurred early, sensory loss and reduced intraepithelial branching of nociceptive nerves were only evident at 22 weeks post-STZ. The longitudinal metabolites screen in peripheral nerves demonstrated that compared with buffer-injected age-matched control mice, mice at 12 and 22 weeks post-STZ showed an early impairment the tricaoboxylic acid (TCA cycle), which is the main pathway of carbohydrate metabolism leading to energy generation. We found that levels of citric acid, ketoglutaric acid (2 KG), succinic acid, fumaric acid, and malic acid were observed to be significantly reduced in sciatic nerve at 22 weeks post-STZ. In addition, we also found the increase in levels of sorbitol and L-lactate in peripheral nerve from 12 weeks post-STZ injection. Amino acid screen in serum showed that the amino acids valine (Val), isoleucine (Ile), and leucine (Leu), grouped together as BCAA, increased more than twofold from 12 weeks post-STZ. Similarly, the levels of  (Tyr), asparagine (Asn), serine (Ser), histidine (His), alanine (Ala), and proline (Pro) showed progressive increase with progression of diabetes. Our results indicate that the impaired TCA cycle metabolites in peripheral nerve are the primary cause of shunting metabolic substrate to compensatory pathways, which leads to sensory nerve fiber loss in skin and contribute to onset and progression of peripheral neuropathy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30743173>Toward a treatment of diabesity: Rational design, synthesis and biological evaluation of benzene-sulfonamide derivatives as a new class of PTP-1B inhibitors.</a></h1><p>Targeting of protein  phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) has emerged as a promising strategy for therapeutic intervention of diabetes and obesity. Investigation of new inhibitors with good bioavailability and high selectivity is the major challenge of drug discovery program targeting PTP1B. Therefore, herein, new neutral benzene-sulfonamide containing compounds were designed, synthesized and biologically evaluated as potent PTP1B inhibitors. New series of thiazolidine, oxazolidine, thiazinan, oxazinan, oxazole, thiazole, tetrazole, cyanopyridine, chromenone, and iminochromene of benzene-sulfonamide derivatives (MSE-1 to MSE-15) were synthesized in a good yield under mild condition using sulfadiazine as a starting material. Among the synthesized compounds, MSE-13 and MSE-14 showed the most in vitro potent PTP-1B inhibitory activity (IC of 0.88 µM and 3.33 µM, respectively). Animal treatment by the target compounds significantly improved the insulin resistance, diminished plasma glucose level, decreased initial , and normalized the serum lipid profile compared to pioglitazone, a standard PTP1B inhibitor. The molecular modeling study showed a high affinity and selectivity of our synthesized compounds to the active site and B-site of PTP1B holding hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, Electrostatic Surface Potential (ESP) and HOMO/LUMO analysis indicated the importance of sulfamoyl moiety for PTP1B binding.

We conducted a retrospective observational multicentric study in Spanish HT1 patients treated with NTBC to assess clinical and biochemical long-term evolution.We evaluated 52 patients, 7 adults and 45 children, treated with NTBC considering: age at diagnosis, diagnosis by clinical symptoms, or by newborn screening (NBS); phenotype (acute/subacute/chronic), mutational analysis; symptoms at diagnosis and clinical course; biochemical markers; doses of NTBC; treatment adherence; anthropometric evolution; and neurocognitive outcome.The average follow-up period was 6.1 ± 4.9 and 10.6 ± 5.4 years in patients with early and late diagnosis respectively. All patients received NTBC from diagnosis with an average dose of 0.82 mg/kg/d. All NBS-patients (n = 8) were asymptomatic at diagnosis except 1 case with acute liver failure, and all remain free of liver and renal disease in follow-up. Liver and renal affectation was markedly more frequent at diagnosis in patients with late diagnosis (P < .001 and .03, respectively), with ulterior positive hepatic and renal course in 86.4% and 93.2% of no-NBS patients, although 1 patient with good metabolic control developed hepatocarcinoma.Despite a satisfactory global nutritional evolution, 46.1% of patients showed overweight/obesity.

Peroxymonocarbonate is more reactive with thiols than HO but it makes up only a small fraction of the HO in physiological bicarbonate buffers so the increase in rate of oxidation of low molecular  thiols is modest. However, for some thiol proteins such as protein  phosphatases, the rate enhancement is very much greater. We have investigated the effect of bicarbonate/CO on the oxidation of peroxiredoxins (Prdxs) 2 and 3. Using an assay in which reduced Prdx2 inhibits oxidation of horseradish peroxidase by HO, we saw no difference between phosphate and bicarbonate buffers (pH 7.4). However, hyperoxidation of both Prdxs in bicarbonate was considerably enhanced. Hyperoxidation involves the reaction of the sulfenic acid formed at the active site with a second HO, and prevents its condensation to a disulfide. Using LC/MS analysis, we determined that the presence of 25 mM bicarbonate/CO increased the ratio of hyperoxidation compared with condensation 6-fold for Prdx2 and 11-fold for Prdx3. These results imply that Prdx hyperoxidation will occur more readily under physiological conditions than appreciated from in vitro experiments, which seldom use bicarbonate buffers. They also raise the possibility that variations in bicarbonate concentration could provide a mechanism for regulating the cellular level of active Prdxs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The decrease in the expression of FGFR2 and MMP2 genes in the mesenchymal stromal cells of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia before discontinuation of treatment can be a predictor of withdrawal syndrome, while simultaneous decrease in the expression of SOX9, PDGFRa, and LIF in these cells attests to undesirability of therapy discontinuation at the moment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981986>Western diet consumption through early life induces microvesicular hepatic steatosis in association with an altered metabolome in low birth  Guinea pigs.</a></h1><p>Uteroplacental insufficiency-induced low birth  (LBW) and postnatal high saturated fat/high sucrose-fructose diet (Western Diet, WD) consumption have been independently associated with the development of hepatic steatosis, while their additive effect on fatty acid, acylcarnitine and amino acid profiles in early adulthood have not been widely reported. We employed LBW, generated via uterine artery ablation, and normal birth  (NBW) male guinea pigs fed either a WD or control diet (CD) from weaning to postnatal day 150 (early adulthood). Hepatic steatosis was absent in CD-fed offspring, while NBW/WD offspring displayed macrovesicular steatosis and LBW/WD offspring exhibited microvesicular steatosis, both occurring in a lean phenotype. Life-long consumption of the WD, irrespective of birth , was associated with an increase in hepatic medium- and long-chain saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, acylcarnitines, reduced oxidative phosphorylation complex III activity and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and molecular evidence of disrupted hepatic insulin signaling. In NBW/WD, hepatic C15:1 and C16:1n-6 fatty acids in phospholipids, C16, C18 and C18:1 acylcarnitines, concentrations of aspartate, phenylalanine,  and tryptophan and expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 alpha (CPT1α) and uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) genes were elevated compared to LBW/WD livers. Our results suggest that LBW and life-long WD combined are influential in promoting hepatic microvesicular steatosis in conjunction with a specific mitochondrial gene expression and metabolomic profile in early adulthood.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

After 10 weeks of a high-salt diet, the GS group rats were given Guizhi Decoction and other two groups were given saline at an equal volume as a vehicle. After 4 weeks' intragastric administration, rats were executed to detect the relevant indicators. Echocardiography and plasma n-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels were used to assess cardiac function. Noradrenaline (NA) levels in the plasma and myocardium were detected to evaluate the sympathetic function. NGF and LIF expression were detected in the myocardium by Western blot or quantitative real-time PCR. Double immunofluorescence or Western blot was used to detect  hydroxylase (TH), choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) and growth associated protein 43 (GAP43) in order to reflect anatomical and functional changes of sympathetic nerves.DS group had anatomical and functional deterioration of sympathetic nerves in the decompensation period of heart failure compared with SS-13 group. Compared with the DS group, Guizhi Decoction significantly decreased the expression of LIF mRNA/protein (P<0.01), increased the expression of NGF (P<0.05 or P<0.01), enhanced the levels of TH/GAP43 and TH/CHAT positive nerve fibers (P<0.01), and improved the protein expression of TH and GAP43 in left ventricle, but had no effect on CHAT (P>0.05). Guizhi Decoction inhibited inflammatory infiltration and collagen deposition of myocardial injury, increased the content of myocardial NA (P<0.05), reduced the plasma NA level (P<0.01), improved cardiac function (P<0.01), and improved  and blood pressure to some extent (P<0.05), compared with DS group.Guizhi Decoction could inhibit cholinergic transdifferentiation of sympathetic nerves, improve the anatomical and functional denervation of sympathetic nerves, and delay the progression of decompensated heart failure. The mechanism may be associated with the correction of the imbalance of NGF and LIF.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894019>Neuron-targeted caveolin-1 improves neuromuscular function and extends survival in SOD1 mice.</a></h1><p>Interventions that preserve motor neurons or restore functional motor neuroplasticity may extend longevity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Delivery of neurotrophins may potentially revive degenerating motor neurons, yet this approach is dependent on the proper subcellular localization of neurotrophin receptor (NTR) to plasmalemmal signaling microdomains, termed membrane/lipid rafts (MLRs). We previously showed that overexpression of synapsin-driven caveolin-1 (Cav-1) () increases MLR localization of NTR [, receptor  kinase B (TrkB)], promotes hippocampal synaptic and neuroplasticity, and significantly improves learning and memory in aged mice. The present study crossed a SynCav1 transgene-positive (SynCav1) mouse with the mutant human superoxide dismutase glycine to alanine point mutation at amino acid 93 (hSOD1) mouse model of ALS. When compared with hSOD1, hSOD1/SynCav1 mice exhibited greater  and longer survival as well as better motor function. Microscopic analyses of hSOD1/SynCav1 spinal cords revealed preserved spinal cord α-motor neurons and preserved mitochondrial morphology. Moreover, hSOD1/SynCav1 spinal cords contained more MLRs (cholera toxin subunit B positive) and MLR-associated TrkB and Cav-1 protein expression. These findings demonstrate that  delays disease progression in a mouse model of ALS, potentially by preserving or restoring NTR expression and localization to MLRs.-Sawada, A., Wang, S., Jian, M., Leem, J., Wackerbarth, J., Egawa, J., Schilling, J.

However, the intermediate metabolites involved in this change remain largely unknown.We conducted targeted metabolomics profiling to identify moieties associated with adult obesity.In this case-control study of Iranian adults, 200 obese patients were compared with 100 controls based on 104 metabolites profiled by a targeted metabolomic approach using liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The analysis comprised acylcarnitines, diacyl-phosphatidylcholines (PCaa), acyl-alkyl-phosphatidylcholines (PCae), sphingomyelins (SM), lyso-phospholipids (LPC) and amino acids. We performed multivariable linear regression to identify metabolites associated with obesity, adjusting for age, sex, total energy intake, total physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for multiple testing.A pattern of 19 metabolites was significantly associated with obesity. Branched chain amino acids, alanine, glutamic acid, proline,  LPCa C16:1, PCaa C32:1, PCaa C32:2 and PCaa C38:3 were positively, while serine, asparagine, LPCa C18:1, LPCa C18:2, LPCe C18:0, PCae C34:3, PCae C38:4 and PCae C40:6 were negatively associated with obesity (all p < 0.00048).A metabolomic profile containing 9 amino acids and 10 polar lipids may serve as a potential biomarker of adult obesity. Further studies are warranted to replicate these findings as well as investigate potential changes in this profile after  reduction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31126840>Combined loss of GLP-1R and Y2R does not alter progression of high-fat diet-induced obesity or response to RYGB surgery in mice.</a></h1><p>Understanding the mechanisms underlying the remarkable beneficial effects of gastric bypass surgery is important for the development of non-surgical therapies or less invasive surgeries in the fight against obesity and metabolic disease. Although the intestinal L-cell hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide - (PYY) have attracted the most attention, direct tests in humans and rodents with pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of either the GLP1-receptor (GLP1R) or the Y2-receptor (Y2R) were unable to confirm their critical roles in the beneficial effects gastric bypass surgery on  and glucose homeostasis. However, new awareness of the power of combinatorial therapies in the treatment of metabolic disease would suggest that combined blockade of more than one signaling pathway may be necessary to reverse the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery.The metabolic effects of high-fat diet and the ability of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery to lower food intake and , as well as improve glucose handling, was tested in GLP1R and Y2R-double knockout (GLP1RKO/Y2RKO) and C57BL6J wildtype (WT) mice.GLP1RKO/Y2RKO and WT mice responded similarly for up to 20 weeks on high-fat diet and 16 weeks after RYGB. There were no significant differences in loss of  and liver , fat mass, reduced food intake, relative increase in energy expenditure, improved fasting insulin, glucose tolerance, and insulin tolerance between WT and GLP1RKO/Y2RKO mice after RYGB.Combined loss of GLP1R and Y2R-signaling was not able to negate or attenuate the beneficial effects of RYGB on  and glucose homeostasis in mice, suggesting that a larger number of signaling pathways is involved or that the critical pathway has not yet been identified.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

There are reports suggesting that insulin resistance is associated with the development of albuminuria in nondiabetic individuals. We have previously reported reduced insulin receptor (IR) expression in renal-tubular-epithelial cells, including PT in various models of insulin resistance. However, the effect of a physiological fall in insulin levels and the role for IR in PT in tubular albumin uptake is not clear. To address these gaps in our understanding, we estimated urine excretion and renal uptake of albumin in fasted and fed C57Bl/6 mice injected with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-albumin (5 µg/mL/kg , intraperitoneal, n = 6 per group). In addition, we compared spot urine analysis from 33 clinically healthy humans after overnight fasting (when insulin levels are lower than in the fed state) and then at 2 hours after 75 g oral glucose challenge (postprandial). Fasted mice had attenuated renal uptake of FITC-albumin and higher excretion in urine, relative to fed mice ( P = 0.04). Moreover, a significant drop in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and urine albumin concentration (UAC) was observed in the postprandial state in these subjects ( P = 0.001 and P = 0.017, for ACR and UAC, respectively). The drop was negatively associated with postprandial blood glucose levels (ρ = -0.36, P = 0.03 for ΔUAC and ρ = -0.34, P = 0.05 for ΔACR). To test the role of IR in PT, we analyzed 24-hour urine albumin excretion in male mice with targeted deletion of IR from PT (insulin receptor knockout [IRKO]) and their wild-type (WT) littermates ( n = 7 per group). IRKO mice had significantly higher 24-hour urine albumin excretion relative to WT. Moreover, kidneys from KO mice revealed reduced expression of megalin and cubulin proteins in the PT relative to the WT. We also demonstrated insulin (100 nM) induced albumin internalization in human proximal tubule cells (hPT) and this effect of insulin was attenuated in hydroxy-2-naphthalenylmethylphosphonic acid (100 µM), a  kinase inhibitor, pretreated hPT. Our findings revealed albumin excretion was attenuated by glucose administration to fasting individuals implying a regulatory role for insulin in PT albumin reabsorption. Thus albuminuria associated with insulin resistance/diabetes may relate not only to glomerular dysfunction but also to impairment in insulin-mediated reabsorption.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31226647>Reductive modification of genetically encoded 3-nitrotyrosine sites in alpha synuclein expressed in E.coli.</a></h1><p> nitration is a post-translational protein modification relevant to various pathophysiological processes. Chemical nitration procedures have been used to generate and study nitrated proteins, but these methods regularly lead to modifications at other amino acid residues. A novel strategy employs a genetic code modification that allows incorporation of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) during ribosomal protein synthesis to generate a recombinant protein with defined 3-NT-sites, in the absence of other post-translational modifications. This approach was applied to study the generation and stability of the 3-NT moiety in recombinant proteins produced in E.coli. Nitrated alpha-synuclein (ASYN) was selected as exemplary protein, relevant in Parkinson's disease (PD). A procedure was established to obtain pure -modified ASYN in mg amounts. However, a rapid (t = 0.4 h) reduction of 3-NT to 3-aminotyrosine (3-AT) was observed. When screening for potential mechanisms, we found that 3-NT can be reduced enzymatically to 3-AT, whilst biologically relevant low molecular  reductants, such as NADPH or GSH, did not affect 3-NT. A genetic screen for E.coli proteins, involved in the observed 3-NT reduction, revealed the contribution of several, possibly redundant pathways. Green fluorescent protein was studied as an alternative model protein. These data confirm 3-NT reduction as a broadly-relevant pathway in E.coli. In conclusion, incorporation of 3-NT as a genetically-encoded non-natural amino acid allows for generation of recombinant proteins with specific nitration sites. The potential reduction of the 3-NT moiety by E.coli, however, requires attention to the design of the purification strategy for obtaining pure nitrated protein.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Phenotyping of activated and regulatory B cells, T lymphocytes and macrophages was performed by flow cytometry on isolated spleen and peritoneal cells. Cytokines were assayed by ELISA.Btk inhibitor Ibrutinib prevented lesion growth, reduced mRNA expression of cyclooxygenase-2, alpha smooth muscle actin and type I collagen in the lesions and skewed activated B cells toward Bregs in the spleen and peritoneal cavity of mice with endometriosis. In addition, the number of M2 macrophages decreased in the peritoneal cavity of Ibrutinib-treated mice compared to anti-CD20 and control mice. Depletion of B cells using an anti-CD20 antibody had no effect on activity and growth of endometriotic lesions and neither on the macrophages, compared to control mice.N/A.It is still unclear whether B cell depletion by the anti-CD20 or inactivation by Ibrutinib can prevent establishment and/or progression of endometriosis in humans.Further investigation may contribute to clarifying the role of B cell subsets in human endometriosis.This research was supported by a grant of Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale and Paris Descartes University.

Sixty rabbits (5-weeks old) were randomly allotted to three dietary treatments containing three amounts of PLM (0%, 15%, and 30%). The results showed that PLM has a higher content of ether extract, organic matter, methionine, , histidine, manganese, and zinc than alfalfa hay.  gain decreased when 30% PLM was provided. The best feed conversion ratio was recorded in the rabbits fed 15% PLM. A notable increase in high-density lipoprotein levels with a significant decrease in low-density lipoprotein was noted in the rabbits fed the PLM diets. Total fungi and Enterobacteriaceae and total bacterial count in the feed were significantly reduced because of PLM. In the cecum, coliforms, Enterobacteriaceae species, and total bacterial count declined in the rabbits fed the PLM diets. Conclusively, up to 15% PLM can be used in rabbit diets without any deleterious effects on the performance, nutrient digestibility, and blood constituents.

In the present study, we investigate the role of the intracellular regulator RhoA in hypothalamic TH neurones in response to peripheral hormones. Diet-induced obesity was found to be associated with increased phosphorylation of TH in ARC, indicating obesity-associated increased activity of ARC TH neurones. Mice in which RhoA was specifically knocked out in TH neurones (TH-RhoA mice) were more sensitive to the orexigenic effect of peripherally administered ghrelin and displayed an abolished response to the anorexigenic hormone leptin. When TH-RhoA mice were challenged with a high-fat high-sucrose (HFHS) diet, they became hyperphagic and gained more  and fat mass compared to wild-type control mice. Importantly, lack of RhoA prevented development of ghrelin resistance, which is normally observed in wild-type mice after long-term HFHS diet feeding. Patch-clamp electrophysiological analysis demonstrated increased ghrelin-induced excitability of TH neurones in lean TH-RhoA mice compared to lean littermate control animals. Additionally, increased expression of the orexigenic hypothalamic neuropeptides agouti-related peptide and neuropeptide Y was observed in TH-RhoA mice. Overall, our data indicate that TH neurones in ARC are important for the regulation of  homeostasis and that RhoA is both a central effector in these neurones and important for the development of obesity-induced ghrelin resistance. The obese phenotype of TH-RhoA mice may be a result of increased sensitivity to ghrelin and decreased sensitivity to leptin, resulting in increased food intake.© 2019 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042769>Csf1r or Mer inhibition delays liver regeneration via suppression of Kupffer cells.</a></h1><p>Murine Kupffer cells (KCs) comprise CD11bhi and F4/80hi subsets. Tissue-resident macrophages are known to express the  kinase receptors colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (Csf1r) and Mer. However, the expression of Csf1r and Mer on KC subsets and the importance of these  kinases during liver regeneration (LR) are unknown.KCs from wild-type and Csf1r-GFP mice were characterized by flow cytometry. Partial hepatectomy (PH) was performed in mice treated with clodronate liposomes, a Csf1r small molecule inhibitor or depleting antibody, or a small molecule Mer inhibitor. Sera and livers were analyzed. The function of sorted KC subsets was tested in vitro.Mer was specifically expressed on tissue-resident F4/80hi KCs, 55% of which also expressed Csf1r. Mer+Csf1r+ and Mer+Csf1r- KCs had distinct expression of macrophage markers. Csf1r inhibition in mice reduced F4/80hi KCs by approximately 50%, but did not affect CD11bhi KCs. Clodronate liposomes depleted F4/80hi KCs, but also altered levels of other intrahepatic leukocytes. Csf1r inhibition delayed LR, as demonstrated by a 20% reduction in liver-to- ratios 7 days after PH. At 36h after PH, Csf1r inhibition increased serum ALT and histological liver injury, and decreased liver cell proliferation. A small molecule inhibitor of Mer did not alter the percentage of KCs or their proliferation and just modestly delayed LR. In vitro, Csf1r or Mer inhibition did not decrease KC viability, but did attenuate their cytokine response to stimulation.F4/80hi KCs are Mer+ and can be subdivided based on Csf1r expression. Csf1r or Mer inhibition each reduces KC cytokine production and delays LR.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31080158>Imatinib mesylate does not counteract ovarian tissue fibrosis in postnatal rat ovary.</a></h1><p>Chemotherapy may result in ovarian atrophy, a depletion of the primordial follicle pool, diminished ovarian , cortical and stromal fibrosis. Imatinib mesylate is an anticancer agent that inhibits competitively several receptor  kinases (RTKs). RTKs play important roles in cell metabolism, proliferation, and apoptosis. In clinic, imatinib mesylate is also known as an anti-fibrotic medicine. In the present study, the impact of imatinib on the ovarian tissue was investigated by assessing ovarian tissue fibrosis in postnatal rat administered with or without imatinib for three days. Fibrosis in the ovarian tissue was determined by histology (Picrosirius and Masson's trichrome staining) and the protein expression of vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Furthermore, mRNA expression of Forkhead box transcription factor O1 and O3 (FOXO1 and FOXO3), which are markers of cell proliferation was quantified. A short-term exposure to imatinib showed to increase tissue fibrosis in ovaries. This was observed by Masson's trichrome staining. Exposure to imatinib led also to a down-regulation of vimentin protein expression and up-regulation mRNA expression of FOXO3. This may indicate a role of FOXO3 in ovarian tissue fibrosis in postnatal rat ovaries.Copyright © 2019 Society for Biology of Reproduction & the Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of Polish Academy of Sciences in Olsztyn.

A QuEChERS extraction method followed by RP-LC-DAD-MS/MS analysis showed that indicaxanthin and betanin were the main compounds (≥94.32% and ≥96.95%, respectively). Orange cactus pear extracts exert the best antioxidant activity in all assays carried out, in particular into ORAC (17,352.55 ± 987.407 mg trolox equivalents/100 g dry ) and β-carotene bleaching (60.35%) assays.

According to antioxidant results, the orange cactus pear extracts showing also the highest anti-angiogenic activity (IC 19.31 μg/ml), followed by the red (IC 23.55 μg/ml) and the yellow ones (IC 33.97 μg/ml). In light of the results and correlation analysis, the behaviour of these molecules varies a lot according to their structure and physicochemical features and synergistic activity between betalain classes may be postulated; so the plant complex could be of greater interest compared with the isolated molecules for potential nutraceutical and pharmaceutical uses.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31537060>Selective Accumulation of Galactomannan Amphiphilic Nanomaterials in Pediatric Solid Tumor Xenografts Correlates with  Gene Expression.</a></h1><p>In this work, we designed, characterized, and investigated the performance of hydrolyzed galactomannan (hGM)-based amphiphilic nanoparticles for selective intratumoral accumulation in pediatric patient-derived sarcomas. To create a self-assembly amphiphilic copolymer, the side chain of hGM was hydrophobized with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) by utilizing a graft free radical polymerization reaction. Different hGM and MMA  feeding ratios were used to adjust the critical aggregation concentration and the size and size distribution of the nanoparticles. The ability to actively target glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) was studied by fluorescence confocal microscopy and imaging flow cytometry in vitro on Rh30 (rhabdomyosarcoma) and patient-derived Ewing sarcoma (HSJD-ES-001) cell lines with different expression levels of GLUT-1. Results confirmed that the nanoparticles are internalized by ∼100% of the cells at 37 °C. Furthermore, we investigated the biodistribution of the nanoparticles in pediatric patient-derived models of two deadly musculoskeletal tumors, rhabdomyosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. Outstandingly, the intratumoral accumulation of the nanoparticles correlated very well with the expression level of  gene in each patient-derived tumor ( 0.0141; Pearson's correlation test). Finally, we demonstrated the encapsulation capacity of these nanoparticles by loading 7.5% (w/w) of the hydrophobic first-generation  kinase inhibitor imatinib.

Currently, therapies are palliative with associated irreversible behavioural incompetence. Here, we investigated the ability of kolaviron (KV), an anti-inflammatory biflavonoid isolated form Garcinia kola seeds, to rescue striatal neuronal damage and redo-inflammation in rats exposed to rotenone (ROT). Aged rats exposed to 11 days of rotenone intoxication were treated with KV either concurrently or for 18 days. The 18-day regimen included 7 days of pre-treatment prior 11-day concurrent ROT-KV treatment. Rotenone-exposed rats lost  appreciably and travelled less distance with reduced speed, decline efficiency to maintain a straight path, enhanced freezing, increased immobile episodes and poor hole recognition. The motor incompetence was attributed to enhanced striatal neurodegeneration, increased alpha synuclein formation and reduced  hydroxylase expression. ROT intoxication significantly increased reactive species production, which co-existed with induction of striatal antioxidant system and damage to biomolecules. ROT additionally upregulated COX-2 expression, enhanced myeloperoxidase activity and increased concentration of striatal inteleukine-6 (IL-6), IL-1β and tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α). Treatment with kolaviron reversed the rotenone-associated locomotor impairment and exploratory deficits, motor/neuromuscular incompetence, striatal neurodegeneration, neurobiochemical imbalance, altered antioxidant defence system and neuroinflammation. KV-treated rats showed improved capacity to maintain efficient gait with minimal rigidity and enhanced coordination. Taken together, kolaviron exhibited neuroprotective properties, which may be beneficial for the prevention and management of Parkinson's disease, via antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic mechanisms.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This visit included recording of maternal demographic characteristics and medical history, sonographic estimation of fetal , color Doppler ultrasound for measurement of mean UtA-PI, and measurement of serum concentrations of PlGF and sFlt-1. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine which of the factors from maternal or pregnancy characteristics and measurements of UtA-PI, PlGF and sFlt-1 provided a significant contribution in the prediction of each of four adverse outcome : first, stillbirth; second, Cesarean delivery for suspected fetal compromise in labor; third, neonatal death or hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy Grade 2 or 3; and, fourth, admission to the neonatal unit (NNU) for ≥ 48 h. Predicted probabilities from logistic regression analysis were used to construct receiver-operating characteristics curves to assess the performance of screening for these adverse outcomes.First, 83% of stillbirths, 82% of Cesarean sections for presumed fetal compromise in labor, 91% of cases of neonatal death or hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and 86% of NNU admissions for ≥ 48 h occurred in pregnancies with a non-SGA neonate. Second, UtA-PI > 95 percentile, sFlt-1 > 95 percentile and PlGF < 5 percentile were associated with increased risk of Cesarean delivery for suspected fetal compromise in labor and NNU admission for ≥ 48 h; the number of stillbirths and cases of neonatal death or hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy was too small to demonstrate significance in the observed differences from cases without these adverse outcomes. Third, multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that, in the prediction of Cesarean delivery for suspected fetal compromise in labor, there was no significant contribution from biomarkers; the prediction of NNU admission for ≥ 48 h by maternal demographic characteristics and medical history was only marginally improved by the addition of sFlt-1 or PlGF. Fourth, for each biomarker, the detection rate of adverse outcome was higher in SGA than in non-SGA neonates, but this increase was accompanied by an increase in false-positive rate. Fifth, the relative risk of UtA-PI > 95 , sFlt-1 > 95 and PlGF < 5 percentiles for most adverse outcomes was < 2.5 in both SGA and non-SGA neonates.In pregnancies undergoing routine antenatal assessment at 35-37 weeks' gestation, measurements of UtA-PI, sFlt-1 or PlGF provide poor prediction of adverse perinatal outcome in both SGA and non-SGA fetuses.

It also decreased the expression of both the hypothalamic NPY and the visceral fat NF-κB.With respect to the fact of improved insulin release and enhanced insulin sensitivity (an effect that may be mediated via suppressing accumulation of visceral fat and inflammatory markers), in the rats treated with PYY3-36, the PYY3-36 might be considered for the future as a promising therapeutic tool in T2DM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30922130>Placental expression of angiogenesis-related genes and their receptors in IUGR pregnancies: correlation with fetoplacental and maternal parameters.</a></h1><p>Aberrations in placental vascular development compromising fetal supply of oxygen and essential nutrients can be a significant contributor to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). The development of placental vascular tree is under the influence of two families of growth factors, namely the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family and angiopoietin/TEK family. In this study, we have examined the expression of angiogenesis-related growth factors, mainly VEGF family and angiopoietin-TEK (endothelial-specific receptor  kinase) family genes in placentae from IUGR pregnancies uncomplicated by preeclampsia (PE) compared to normal pregnancies.Placentae from normotensive IUGR (n = 42) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) pregnancies (n = 47) were collected and examined histologically. Clinical parameters were obtained from the medical records. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed to assess placental transcript abundance of VEGF, PGF, FLT1, ANGPT1, ANGPT2, and TEK normalized to a panel of reference genes. Associations of placental transcript abundance of the genes with maternal, placental, and neonatal parameters were tested.Placental transcript abundance for VEGF (relative expression 10.81 versus 12.98, p < .001), PGF (12.14 versus 13.8, p < .001) and ANGPT2 (3.67 versus 9.55, p = .002) were significantly lower in IUGR placentae compared to AGA. The transcript level of VEGF showed significant negative correlation with birth  (r = -0.419, p = .006), placental  (r = -0.318, p = .040), placental length (r = -0.389, p = .011) and breadth (r = -0.308, p = .047) only in the IUGR group. Presence of histopathological features of hypoxia correlated with significantly higher transcript levels of PGF in IUGR placentae (12.6 versus 10.9, p = .046).The low levels of VEGF transcripts may be responsible for the impaired angiogenesis in IUGR placentae. The significance of higher relative expression of PGF in the presence of chronic hypoxia needs to be explored.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31387063>Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel 4-anilinoquinazoline derivatives as hypoxia-selective EGFR and VEGFR-2 dual inhibitors.</a></h1><p> kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have achieved substantial clinical effects for cancer treatment while causing a number of adverse effects. Since hypoxia is an intrinsic difference between solid tumor and healthy tissues, one strategy to overcome the adverse effects of TKIs is to enhance the specificity of anti-tumor activity by selectively targeting hypoxic region of tumors. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of novel 4-anilinoquinazoline derivatives by introducing 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazole group to the side chain of vandetanib with modification of aniline moiety. Lead compounds, 10a and 10g, exhibited potent inhibitory activity against EGFR and VEGFR-2 kinase. Moreover, these two compounds were shown to enhance anti-proliferative activities on A549 and H446 cells under hypoxic conditions compared to vandetanib and dramatically down-regulate VEGF gene expression. In vivo studies confirmed that 10a and 10g not only inhibited tumor growth in A549 xenografts of BALB/c-nu mice but also significantly reduce toxicity associated with  loss compared to vandetanib. These results suggest that EGFR/VEGFR-2 dual inhibitors, 10a and 10g, emerged as potential hypoxia-selective anti-tumor drugs with less toxicity for inhibiting in vitro and in vivo models of non-small cell lung cancer cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The present study aimed to explore the regulatory effects of pulmonary cDCs on acute lung inflammation and injury in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‑induced ARDS. Fms‑like  kinase 3‑ligand (FLT3L) and lestaurtinib, a specific activator and an inhibitor of FLT3 signaling respectively, were used separately for the pretreatment of C57BL/6 mice for 5 consecutive days. ARDS was induced by intratracheal injection of LPS, and mice were sacrificed 6 and 24 h later. Flow cytometry was used to measure the aggregation and maturation of pulmonary cDCs. The ratio of lung wet  to  (LWW/BW) and histopathological analyses were assessed to evaluate lung edema and lung injury. Tumor necrosis factor‑α and interleukin (IL)‑6 levels were measured by ELISA to evaluate acute lung inflammation. The levels of interferon‑γ, IL‑1β, IL‑4 and IL‑10, and the expression of the transcription factors T‑box‑expressed‑in‑T‑cells (T‑bet) and GATA binding protein 3, were quantified by ELISA, RT‑qPCR and western blotting to evaluate the balance of the Th1/Th2 response. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was measured to evaluate neutrophil infiltration. The results demonstrated that the aggregation and maturation of pulmonary cDCs reached a peak at 6 h after LPS challenge, followed by a significant decrease at 24 h. FLT3L pretreatment further stimulated the aggregation and maturation of pulmonary cDCs, resulting in elevated lung MPO activity and increased T‑bet expression, which in turn led to aggravated LWW/BW, acute lung inflammation and injury. However, lestaurtinib pretreatment inhibited the aggregation and maturation of pulmonary cDCs, decreased lung MPO activity and T‑bet expression, and eventually improved LWW/BW, acute lung inflammation and injury. The present results suggested that pulmonary cDCs regulated acute lung inflammation and injury in LPS‑induced ARDS through the modulation of neutrophil infiltration and balance of the Th1/Th2 response.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707967>Prediction of small for gestational age neonates: screening by maternal factors, fetal biometry, and biomarkers at 35-37 weeks' gestation.</a></h1><p>Small for gestational age (SGA) neonates are at increased risk for perinatal mortality and morbidity; however, the risks can be substantially reduced if the condition is identified prenatally, because in such cases close monitoring and appropriate timing of delivery and prompt neonatal care can be undertaken. The traditional approach of identifying pregnancies with SGA fetuses is maternal abdominal palpation and serial measurements of symphysial-fundal height, but the detection rate of this approach is less than 30%. A higher performance of screening for SGA is achieved by sonographic fetal biometry during the third trimester; screening at 30-34 weeks' gestation identifies about 80% of SGA neonates delivering preterm but only 50% of those delivering at term, at a screen-positive rate of 10%. There is some evidence that routine ultrasound examination at 36 weeks' gestation is more effective than that at 32 weeks in predicting birth of SGA neonates.To investigate the potential value of maternal characteristics and medical history, sonographically estimated fetal  (EFW) and biomarkers of impaired placentation at 35- 36 weeks' gestation in the prediction of delivery of SGA neonates.A dataset of 19,209 singleton pregnancies undergoing screening at 35-36 weeks' gestation was divided into a training set and a validation set. The training dataset was used to develop models from multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine whether the addition of uterine artery pulsatility index (UtA-PI), umbilical artery PI (UA-PI), fetal middle cerebral artery PI (MCA-PI), maternal serum placental growth factor (PlGF) and soluble fms-like  kinase-1 (sFLT) would improve the performance of maternal factors and EFW in the prediction of delivery of SGA neonates. The models were then tested in the validation dataset to assess performance of screening.First, in the training dataset, in the SGA group, compared to those with birthweight in ≥10th percentile, the median multiple of the median (MoM) values of PlGF and MCA-PI were reduced, whereas UtA-PI, UA-PI, and sFLT were increased. Second, multivariable regression analysis demonstrated that in the prediction of SGA in <10th percentile there were significant contributions from maternal factors, EFW Z-score, UtA-PI MoM, MCA-PI MoM, and PlGF MoM. Third, in the validation dataset, prediction of 90% of SGA neonates delivering within 2 weeks of assessment was achieved by a screen-positive rate of 67% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64-70%) in screening by maternal factors, 23% (95% CI, 20-26%) by maternal factors, and EFW and 21% (95% CI, 19-24%) by the addition of biomarkers. Fourth, prediction of 90% of SGA neonates delivering at any stage after assessment was achieved by a screen-positive rate of 66% (95% CI, 65-67%) in screening by maternal factors, 32% (95% CI, 31-33%) by maternal factors and EFW and 30% (95% CI, 29-31%) by the addition of biomarkers.The addition of biomarkers of impaired placentation only marginally improves the predictive performance for delivery of SGA neonates achieved by maternal factors and fetal biometry at 35-36 weeks' gestation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It mediates its effects through the IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R), a widely expressed cell surface  kinase receptor. The aim of the study was to analyze pre- and post-natal growth, clinical features and laboratory findings in a small for gestational age (SGA) girl in whom discordant postnatal growth persisted and her appropriate for gestational age (AGA) brother.A girl born with a low  and length [-2.3 and -2.4 standard deviation (SD) score (SDS), respectively] but borderline low head circumference (-1.6 SD) presented with a height of -1.7 SDS, in contrast to a normal height twin brother (0.0 SDS). IGF-1 resistance was suspected because of elevated serum IGF-1 levels.Sequencing revealed the presence of a previously described pathogenic heterozygous mutation (p.Glu1050Lys) in the SGA girl which was not present in the parents nor in the AGA twin brother.The pathogenic  mutation in this girl led to intrauterine growth retardation followed by partial postnatal catch-up growth. Height in mid-childhood was in the lower half of the reference range, but still 1.7 SD shorter than her twin brother.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649841>Structural simplification: an efficient strategy in lead optimization.</a></h1><p>The trend toward designing large hydrophobic molecules for lead optimization is often associated with poor drug-likeness and high attrition rates in drug discovery and development. Structural simplification is a powerful strategy for improving the efficiency and success rate of drug design by avoiding "molecular obesity". The structural simplification of large or complex lead compounds by truncating unnecessary groups can not only improve their synthetic accessibility but also improve their pharmacokinetic profiles, reduce side effects and so on. This review will summarize the application of structural simplification in lead optimization. Numerous case studies, particularly those involving successful examples leading to marketed drugs or drug-like candidates, will be introduced and analyzed to illustrate the design strategies and guidelines for structural simplification.© 2019 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

Here, we tested whether long-term preventive treadmill training (16 weeks, 21 m/min, and 0° inclinations for 50 min/d, 5 d/week) effects the mitochondrial and neurodegeneration markers, in the striatum of rats in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model of Parkinson's disease. Following 16 weeks of exercise or no exercise period (n = 16 rats per group), the animals were divided into four experimental groups (n = 8 per group): (1) no exercise and saline (SED), (2) exercise and saline (EX), (3) no exercise and 6-OHDA (SED + 6-OHDA), and (4) exercise and 6-OHDA (EX + 6-OHDA). For the model, 8 μg of 6-OHDA (2 μg/μL prepared in a solution of 0.2% ascorbic acid and 0.9% saline) was injected into the right medial forebrain bundle. Exposure to 6-OHDA resulted in a significant reduction (P < 0.05) of mitochondrial factors AMP-activated protein kinase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha, and  hydroxylase, and increased expression of silent information regulator T1, mitochondrial transcription factor A, and p53 in the SED + 6-OHDA group relative to SED group. By contrast, gene and protein expressions upon exercise were higher and p53 protein level was lower in the EX + 6-OHDA group compared with SED + 6-OHDA. Further, exercise reduced the extent of  loss associated with the 6-OHDA injection. In conclusion, exercise might be used to reduce mitochondrial disorders in Parkinson's disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30845793>Protein  Phosphatase, Receptor Type B (PTPRB) Inhibits Brown Adipocyte Differentiation through Regulation of VEGFR2 Phosphorylation.</a></h1><p>Brown adipocytes have an important role in the regulation of energy balance through uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1)-mediated nonshivering thermogenesis. Although brown adipocytes have been highlighted as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic diseases, such as obesity and type II diabetes in adult humans, the molecular mechanism underlying brown adipogenesis is not fully understood. We recently found that protein  phosphatase receptor type B (PTPRB) expression dramatically decreased during brown adipogenic differentiation. In this study, we investigated the functional roles of PTPRB and its regulatory mechanism during brown adipocyte differentiation. Ectopic expression of PTPRB led to a reduced brown adipocyte differentiation by suppressing the  phosphorylation of VEGFR2, whereas a catalytic inactive PTPRB mutant showed no effects on differentiation and phosphorylation. Consistently, the expression of brown adipocyte-related genes, such as UCP-1, PGC-1α, PRDM16, PPAR-γ, and CIDEA, were significantly inhibited by PTPRB overexpression. Overall, these results suggest that PTPRB functions as a negative regulator of brown adipocyte differentiation through its phosphatase activity-dependent mechanism and may be used as a target protein for the regulation of obesity and type II diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31179529>Development of anti-Müllerian hormone immunoassay based on biolayer interferometry technology.</a></h1><p>Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is a biomarker for the assessment of female fertility. The accurate measurement of the concentration of AMH is relevant for the success of assisted reproductive therapies and diagnosis of clinical cases. In this study, we show that cytokines such as fetal liver  kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L), CC subtype chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and β-microglobulin (βM) significantly enhance the immune response against AMH. Two anti-AMH monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with high affinity were selected by biolayer interferometry (BLI) technology for application in a fully automated magnetic chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). This robust and rapid assay can efficiently detect AMH in the range of 0.125~20 ng mL with a detection limit of 0.099 ng mL. This immunoassay showed high specificity with no cross-reaction with structurally related proteins and some of the other members of the TGF-β super family, such as inhibin A, activin A, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone. The average recovery rates of three different batches were 100.19%, 102.72%, and 103.59%, respectively, with coefficients of variation of less than 12%. The developed assay was applied in the detection of AMH in 69 serum samples from randomly selected patients. Our data showed a high correlation with those obtained using commercially available ELISA kits (correlation coefficient, 0.9831). Hence, we suggest that this immunoassay could find application in the development of POCT for the diagnosis of AMH in clinical samples.

The safety profile of lorlatinib was established based on 295 patients who had received the recommended dose of lorlatinib 100 mg once daily. Adverse events associated with lorlatinib are primarily mild to moderate in severity, with hypercholesterolemia (82.4%), hypertriglyceridemia (60.7%), edema (51.2%), peripheral neuropathy (43.7%), and central nervous system effects (39.7%) among the most frequently reported. These can be effectively managed with dose modification and/or standard supportive medical therapy, as indicated by a low incidence of permanent discontinuations due to adverse reactions. Most patients (81.0%) received at least one lipid-lowering agent. Prescription of supportive therapy should also consider the potential for drug-drug interactions with lorlatinib via engagement of specific CYP450 enzymes. This article summarizes the clinical experience from lorlatinib phase I investigators and was generated from discussion and review of the clinical study protocol and database to provide an expert consensus opinion on the management of the key adverse reactions reported with lorlatinib, including hyperlipidemia, central nervous system effects,  increase, edema, peripheral neuropathy, and gastrointestinal effects. Overall, lorlatinib 100 mg once daily has a unique safety profile to be considered when prescribed, based on the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with a second-generation ALK TKI. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Despite the advancement of second-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)  kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the emergence of resistance and progression of central nervous system metastases remain clinically significant problems in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. Lorlatinib is a potent, brain-penetrant, third-generation, macrocyclic ALK/ROS1 TKI, with broad-spectrum potency against most known resistance mutations that can develop during treatment with existing first- and second-generation ALK TKIs.

Methods Maternal serum samples were analysed at 241/7-28 0/7, and 281/7-320/7 weeks of gestation. The level of sFLT-1 and PIGF was determined by immunoassay platform and used to calculate the sFLT-1/PIGF ratio in 35 pregnant women, and divided into subgroups according to preeclampsia occurrence at the time of delivery: preterm (≤37 weeks) or term (37-42 weeks'), and matched a control group. Results Patients in the preterm delivery group had a significantly higher incidence of intrauterine growth restriction, lower gestational age at the time of delivery, and lower infant birth  compared to the other two groups. There was a negative correlation between the sFLT-1/PlGF ratio and GA and between the sFLT-1/ PlGF ratio and birth  at the time of delivery. The value of the sFLT-1/PlGF ratio was significantly higher in the preterm delivery PE group. All the PE group pregnancies ended with caesarean delivery compared to 25% in the control group. However, none of the patients from the PE group had any of the possible complications of preeclampsia nor did they require additional therapy such as blood transfusion or additional non-standard hypertensive therapy. Conclusion The sFLT-1/PlGF ratio could be used as an indicator for the development and estimation of the severity of PE to provide objective evidence for the management of preeclampsia patients, and as a predictive marker of preeclampsia at low cost.Copyright© by the Medical Assotiation of Zenica-Doboj Canton.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30971437>Dietary supplementation with inulin-propionate ester or inulin improves insulin sensitivity in adults with overweight and obesity with distinct effects on the gut microbiota, plasma metabolome and systemic inflammatory responses: a randomised cross-over trial.</a></h1><p>To investigate the underlying mechanisms behind changes in glucose homeostasis with delivery of propionate to the human colon by comprehensive and coordinated analysis of gut bacterial composition, plasma metabolome and immune responses.Twelve non-diabetic adults with overweight and obesity received 20 g/day of inulin-propionate ester (IPE), designed to selectively deliver propionate to the colon, a high-fermentable fibre control (inulin) and a low-fermentable fibre control (cellulose) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Outcome measurements of metabolic responses, inflammatory markers and gut bacterial composition were analysed at the end of each 42-day supplementation period.Both IPE and inulin supplementation improved insulin resistance compared with cellulose supplementation, measured by homeostatic model assessment 2 (mean±SEM 1.23±0.17 IPE vs 1.59±0.17 cellulose, p=0.001; 1.17±0.15 inulin vs 1.59±0.17 cellulose, p=0.009), with no differences between IPE and inulin (p=0.272). Fasting insulin was only associated positively with plasma  and negatively with plasma glycine following inulin supplementation. IPE supplementation decreased proinflammatory interleukin-8 levels compared with cellulose, while inulin had no impact on the systemic inflammatory markers studied. Inulin promoted changes in gut bacterial populations at the class level (increased Actinobacteria and decreased Clostridia) and order level (decreased Clostridiales) compared with cellulose, with small differences at the species level observed between IPE and cellulose.These data demonstrate a distinctive physiological impact of raising colonic propionate delivery in humans, as improvements in insulin sensitivity promoted by IPE and inulin were accompanied with different effects on the plasma metabolome, gut bacterial populations and markers of systemic inflammation.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Composting treatment can change the MW and polarity of the DOM through microbial transformation and degradation. However, the relationship between the redox properties of compost-derived DOM and its MW and polarity is still unclear. DOM was extracted from municipal solid wastes with different composting times in this study, and it was further fractionated into humic acids (HA), fulvic acids (FA) and hydrophilic (HyI) fractions based on its hydrophobicity and XAD-8 resin. Electron transfer capacities [including electron accepting capacities (EAC) and electron donating capacities (EDC)] of the HA, FA and HyI fractions and their associations with polarity and MW were studied. The results showed that the EAC of the HA, FA and HyI all increased after composting. The EDC of the HA and HyI exhibited an increasing trend as well, though that of the FA decreased remarkably after composting. The MW, polarity and redox-active functional groups of the HA, FA and HyI fractions were determined using high performance liquid chromatography and excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectra coupled with parallel factor analysis. The result showed that the quinone-like groups were mainly detected in the medium MW and transphilic sub-fractions of the HA, FA and HyI, and were the main functional groups responsible for the EAC. The low MW sub-fractions, which consisted mainly of -like matter, were the main functional components accounted for the EDC. The results advance our understanding of the influence of MW and polarity on the redox properties of organic substances, and facilitate to reveal the important redox-active functional groups when compost is utilized to remediate the contaminated soil.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The use of placental biomarkers has been proposed for risk stratification in pre-eclampsia, but they could be equally useful in fetal growth restriction in aiding management.To determine the efficacy of angiogenic biomarkers at predicting adverse pregnancy outcome in severe early-onset fetal growth restriction.This is a secondary analysis of the multicentre, placebo-controlled STRIDER UK randomised controlled trial of singleton pregnancies with severe early-onset fetal growth restriction. Women with FGR pregnancies between 22 and 29 weeks of gestation were randomly assigned to receive either sildenafil 25 mg three times daily or placebo until 32 weeks' gestation or delivery. We developed prediction models based upon maternal demographics (age, parity, blood pressure, preeclampsia, gestational hypertension), fetal biometric (estimated fetal ) and Doppler measurements (Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA), Umbilical Artery (UA)) and maternal angiogenic biomarkers [placental growth factor (PlGF), soluble endoglin (sEng), soluble fms-like  kinase 1 (sFlt-1) and sFlt-1:PlGF ratio) using both univariate and multivariate analysis.A complete data set was available for 105 of 135 randomised women. Multivariate regression analysis identified estimated fetal  (EFW) and sFlt-1:PlGF as independent predictors of livebirth (EFW OR: 1.01 (1.008, 1.021); p < 0.001 and lower sFlt-1:PlGF ratio OR: 0.53 (0.284, 0.994); p = 0.048) and overall survival (EFW OR: 1.01 (1.006, 1.015); p < 0.001 and lower sFlt-1/PlGF ratio OR: 0.51 (0.286, 0.904); p = 0.021). EFW was a consistent predictor for all outcomes other than gestation at delivery. sFlt-1:PlGF ratio was a consistent predictor for all outcomes other than neonatal morbidity.In severe early-onset FGR pregnancies livebirth and overall survival can be predicted using a model involving EFW and sFlt-1:PlGF ratio. This model require validation in a larger cohort but may allow informed decision making about pregnancy management, especially in previable cases.Copyright © 2019.

The results indicated that pre-ozonation efficiently mitigated membrane fouling of natural organic matter (NOM). The higher ozone doses were, the more the performance transmembrane pressures (TMPs) decreased. Ozone mainly converted macro molecule organics into low molecule organics. Macro molecular biopolymers (BP) can be removed up to 35.5% with an ozone treatment of 9 mg/L, while low molecular  building blocks of acids and humics (BB) and neutrals (LMWN) increased 7.25% and 14.62%, respectively, with an ozone treatment of 9 mg/L. Analysis of fluorescence excitation emission matrices (EEMs) coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) indicated that ozone mainly removed soluble microbial organics and fulvic-like and humic-like organics but not  organics. Hydrophobic organics (HPO) were reduced with an increase of ozone doses, especially macro molecular BP and humic substances (HS), and the neutral hydrophilic fraction (N-HPI) was enhanced. Ozone treatment helped to reduce the interception of BP and HS in HPO and improved the interception of BP and HS in N-HPI, as well as BB and LMWN, in both fractions. Principal component analysis suggested that BP, as well as UV, had high correlations with a membrane fouling index, which can be used as the fouling indicator during ozone treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Appetite stimulators include orexin and neuropeptide Y (NPY), and reproductive hormones include gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH), kisspeptin, and neurokinin B (NKB). GnRH stimulates the secretion of pituitary gonadotropes, and kisspeptin and GnIH modulate this action. Kisspeptin secretion is further controlled by neurokinin B (NKB) and dynorphin A (Dyn). To better understand the mechanisms regulating appetite and reproduction in fish, we examined the effects of fasting, reproductive stage, gender, and strain on the brain mRNA expression of appetite (orexin and NPY) and reproductive (GnRH, kisspeptin, GnIH, and NKB) hormones in zebrafish. In order to compare strains, we used both wild-type and transparent Casper zebrafish. In female wild-type zebrafish, fasting increased the expression of all hormones investigated, with the exception of Kiss2. Only NPY and Kiss2 were increased in male wild-type zebrafish during fasting. In Casper zebrafish, only GnIH and NKB in males were affected by fasting, suggesting that Casper fish may be more resistant to fasting than wild fish. Fasting increased expressions of orexin, GnRH2, Kiss1, GnIH and NKB in wild-type females with more eggs or larger eggs relative to , compared to those with fewer or smaller eggs, suggesting that more mature females are more affected by fasting. No significant interactions of fasting and reproductive stage were noted in female Casper fish. To investigate whether differences between Casper and wild-type fish were due to genes involved in pigmentation, we compared the brain mRNA expressions of enzymes involved in melanin synthesis (tyrosinase and  hydroxylase - TH), melanocortin receptors (MC3R and MC4R), and the melanocortin precursor (proopiomelanocortin - POMC) between the two strains. Casper zebrafish had lower levels of MC3R, tyrosinase, TH1, TH2, and POMC than wild-type fish. Overall, our results suggest the existence of gender- and reproductive stage-specific, as well as strain-specific variations in the mechanisms regulating feeding and reproduction in zebrafish, and that the melanocortin system and melanin pathways may be in part responsible for these differences between strains.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Serum PlGF and sFlt-1 were assayed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assays. Doppler indices of the uterine artery, umbilical artery, fetal middle cerebral artery, and ductus venosus were measured.The pulsatility index of the uterine artery was negatively correlated with PlGF (r, -0.487; P=0.004) and positively correlated with sFlt-1 (r, 0.420; P=0.015). Gestational age at birth was positively correlated with PlGF (r, 0.601, P<0.001) and negatively correlated with sFlt-1 (r, -0.568; P=0.001). Birth  was positively correlated with PlGF (r, 0.555; P=0.001) and negatively correlated with sFlt-1 (r, -0.552; P=0.001).

Approximately 4-10% of EGFR mutations in NSCLC are EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, which are reportedly associated with resistance to EGFR  kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) treatment. NSCLC patients carrying these mutations are rarely treated with EGFR-TKIs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of afatinib or osimertinib plus cetuximab combination therapy in experimental NSCLC models with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.The EGFR mutations examined in this study were A763_Y764insFQEA, Y764_V765insHH, A767_V769dupASV, and D770_N771insNPG. Ba/F3 cells constitutively expressing wild type or mutated EGFR were used to determine the efficacy of afatinib or osimertinib plus cetuximab combination therapy in vitro. To determine the efficacy of the combination therapy in vivo, female BALB/c-nu mice were injected subcutaneously with 1 million Ba/F3 cells carrying EGFR A767_V769dupASV or Y764_V765insHH.We observed a mild but significant (P < 0.05) additive effect of the combination therapy against several EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations in vitro. Regarding EGFR A767_V769dupASV and EGFR Y764_V765insHH, cetuximab and afatinib single treatment did not induce significant inhibition of tumor formation; however, afatinib plus cetuximab combination treatment induced significant (P < 0.05) tumor growth inhibition without significant  loss or skin rash.The combination therapy induced a more potent inhibitory effect against several EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations than either therapy alone. Cetuximab can potentially increase the efficacy of afatinib or osimertinib in NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To reduce racial disparities in health, a complete understanding of the pathophysiology of frailty is needed. Metabolomics may further our understanding by characterizing differences in the  during a vigorous versus frail state. We sought to identify metabolites and biological pathways associated with vigor to frailty among 287 black men ages 70-81 from the Health, Aging, and  Composition study. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, 350 metabolites were measured in overnight-fasting plasma. The Scale of Aging Vigor in Epidemiology (SAVE) measured vigor to frailty based on  change, strength, energy, gait speed, and physical activity. Thirty-seven metabolites correlated with SAVE scores ( < 0.05), while adjusting for age and site. Fourteen metabolites remained significant after multiple comparisons adjustment (false discovery rate < 0.30). Lower values of tryptophan, methionine, , asparagine, C14:0 sphingomyelin, and 1-methylnicotinamide, and higher values of glucoronate, N-carbamoyl-beta-alanine, isocitrate, creatinine, C4-OH carnitine, cystathionine, hydroxyphenylacetate, and putrescine were associated with frailer SAVE scores. Pathway analyses identified nitrogen metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and the citric acid cycle.

Soluble fms-like  kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and placental growth factor (PIGF) were measured in the maternal serum ≤48 h before delivery.Antihypertensive therapy was administered to 98, 96, 82, 78, and 56% of sPE antepartum and on postpartum days 0-3, respectively. De novo postpartum hypertension (BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg) occurred in 24.4% (22/90) of the normotensive group but only one required antihypertensive therapy. The occurrence of de novo postpartum hypertension was associated with maternal  before delivery ≥ 84.5 kg (relative risks (RR) 2.6, CI 95% 1.2-5.8, p = .017), and  mass index before delivery ≥ 33.3 kg/m (RR 2.9, CI 95% 1.3-6.4, p = .008). In sPE, the BP decreased between predelivery period and postpartum day 0. From days 1 to 3 postpartum, there was a continuous increase in the daily mean BPs in both groups, with average daily increments (systolic/diastolic) being 5.6/4.6 mmHg and 0.6/1.3 mmHg in the sPE and normotensive women, respectively. Patient's group and time had a significant effect on BP, p < .001. Overall, daily mean BPs were higher in the sPE than the normotensive group (p < .001). Perceived stress (p = .022), low birth  (p = .002), 5 min Apgar score ≤ 6 (p < .001) were significantly higher in the sPE group. sFlt-1/PIGF ratio was high in the hypertensive groups: sPE versus normotensive group, p < .001; de novo postpartum hypertension versus normotensives group that remained normotensive, p = .102.Postpartum BP and antihypertensive requirements are important considerations in managing sPE and normotensive pregnancies. sPE is associated with increased maternal stress and poor perinatal outcomes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31020303> based cationic acrylates as potent antimicrobial agents against shigellosis.</a></h1><p>Incorporation of  within synthetic macromolecules via the controlled radical polymerization technique is of particular interest due to the presence of a phenolic group in  imparting high inhibition potential.  incorporation is also fascinating from a medicinal point of view since this particular amino acid is present in several natural antimicrobial peptides as a key constituent. This study describes a facile strategy to integrate the naturally occurring proteinogenic amino acid  within a polyacrylate system via the reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization technique to construct potent bioactive macromolecules against the microbial strain S. flexneri 2a causing shigellosis. The cationic charge and amphiphilic features inherited from the amino acid  mimic the function of natural antimicrobial peptides.

The details of membrane disintegration and depolarization due to alteration in membrane potential have been evaluated via flow cytometric and fluorescence microscopic measurements. Most importantly, the side chain -based polymers show fascinating biocidal features against the Gram-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacterial strain, the major causative agent of nosocomial infections.

This study aimed to examine the effect of maternal undernutrition during mid-gestation on kid meat production under an extensive system. Twenty-seven goats (45 ± 3 d of gestation) were randomly assigned to an unrestricted group (100% of nutrient requirements), or a restricted group (60% of nutrient requirements from 45 to 100 d of gestation, and then re-alimented to 100%). Among the offspring, 16 eligible kids (eight per treatment) were selected, based on birth type and survival, and were harvested to evaluate the meat yield, quality, and composition at 90 d after birth. Maternal undernutrition reduced the  and size, average daily gain and hot carcass  of the kids ( < 0.05). The lightness of the meat at 45 min postmortem was increased ( = 0.029) in the restricted kids. Apart from an increase in  concentration ( = 0.046), the proximate composition and the amino acid and fatty acid profiles were unaffected in the restricted kids ( > 0.05). Overall, maternal undernutrition during mid-gestation decreased the yield of kid meat, but did not significantly modify the quality and composition.

Morin is a natural polyphenol which negatively modulates, among others, the activity of LMW-PTP, leading to the potentiation of the effects of different antitumoral drugs, representing a potential beneficial treatment against cancer.LMW-PTP levels were measured by immunoblot analysis both in CLL cells from patients and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)-derived Mec-1 cells. Cell viability was assessed in Mec-1 cells treated with morin alone or in combination with either fludarabine or ibrutinib or following siRNA-mediated LMW-PTP knockdown. Furthermore, the expression levels of VLA-4 and CXCR4 were assessed by both qRT-PCR and flow cytometry and both adhesion to fibronectin-coated plates and migration toward CXCL12 were analyzed in Mec-1 cells treated with morin alone or in combination with fludarabine or ibrutinib.We observed that LMW-PTP is highly expressed in Mec-1 cells as well as in leukemic B lymphocytes purified from CLL patients compared to normal B lymphocytes. Morin treatment strongly decreased LMW-PTP expression levels in Mec-1 cells and potentiated the anticancer properties of both fludarabine and ibrutinib by increasing their apoptotic effects on leukemic cells. Moreover, morin negatively regulates adhesion and CXCL12-dependent migration of Mec-1 cells by affecting VLA-4 integrin expression and CXCR4 receptor recycling.Morin treatment in CLL-derived Mec-1 cell line synergizes with conventional anticancer drugs currently used in CLL therapy by affecting leukemic cell viability and trafficking.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30768803>Relationship between dermoscopy and pathology in a case of clonal-type pigmented Bowen's disease: Observation with vertical-view dermoscopy.</a></h1><p>Pigmented Bowen's disease (pBD) is a subtype of Bowen's disease, which presents clinically as a well-circumscribed, hyperpigmented plaque. Its clinical manifestations are not fully characterized, and differential diagnoses include various pigmented skin lesions. Dermoscopy could be useful for the diagnosis, although nothing has been reported on the dermoscopic features of clonal-type pBD. We herein report a first case of clonal-type pBD on the sole and its dermoscopic features. Dermoscopy showed brown to blue-gray dots/globules and focally anastomosing lines on the non--bearing area, while the -bearing area had a brown to blue-gray fibrillar-like pattern.

Metal-dependent protein  phosphatases that belong to the polymerase and histindinol phosphatase (PHP) family are widespread in Gram-positive bacteria. Here, we show that , a Gram-negative periodontal pathogen, expresses a PHP protein, Php1, with divalent metal ion-dependent  phosphatase activity. Php1  phosphatase activity was attenuated by mutation of conserved histidine residues that are important for the coordination of metal ions and by mutation of a conserved arginine residue, a key residue for catalysis in other bacterial PHPs. The  gene is located immediately downstream of the gene encoding the bacterial  (BY) kinase Ptk1, which was a substrate for Php1  Php1 rapidly caused the conversion of Ptk1 to a state of low  phosphorylation in the absence of discernible intermediate phosphoforms. Active Php1 was required for  exopolysaccharide production and for community development with the antecedent oral biofilm constituent  under nutrient-depleted conditions. In contrast, the absence of Php1 had no effect on the ability of  to form monospecies biofilms. , Php1 enzymatic activity was resistant to the effects of the streptococcal secreted metabolites pABA and HO, which inhibited Ltp1, an enzyme in the low-molecular- (LMW) phosphotyrosine phosphatase family. Ptk1 reciprocally phosphorylated Php1 on  residues 159 and 161, which independently impacted phosphatase activity. Loss of Php1 rendered  nonvirulent in an animal model of periodontal disease. Collectively, these results demonstrate that  possesses active PHP and LMW  phosphatases, a unique configuration in Gram-negatives which may allow  to maintain phosphorylation/dephosphorylation homeostasis in multispecies communities. Moreover, Php1 contributes to the pathogenic potential of the organism. Periodontal diseases are among the most common infections of humans and are also associated with systemic inflammatory conditions. Colonization and pathogenicity of  are regulated by signal transduction pathways based on protein  phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Here, we identify and characterize a novel component of the  (de)phosphorylation axis: a polymerase and histindinol phosphatase (PHP) family enzyme. This  phosphatase, designated Php1, was required for  community development with other oral bacteria, and in the absence of Php1 activity  was unable to cause disease in a mouse model of periodontitis. This work provides significant insights into the protein  (de)phosphorylation network in , its adaptation to heterotypic communities, and its contribution to colonization and virulence.Copyright © 2019 Jung et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30915029>Acipimox Administration With Exercise Induces a Co-feedback Action of the GH, PP, and PYY on Ghrelin Associated With a Reduction of Peripheral Lipolysis in Bulimic and Healthy- Czech Women: A Randomized Study.</a></h1><p> Anti-lipolytic drugs and exercise are enhancers of growth hormone (GH) secretion. Decreased circulating free fatty acids (FFA) have been proposed to exert ghrelin-GH feedback loop after administration of an anti-lipolytic longer-acting analog of nicotinic acid, Acipimox (OLB, 5-Methylpyrazine-2-carboxylic acid 4-oxide, molecular  of 154.1 Da). OLB administration strongly suppresses plasma FFA during exercise. Neuroendocrine perturbations of the adipose tissue (AT), gut, and brain peptides may be involved in the etiopathogenesis of eating disorders including bulimia nervosa (BN) and anorexia nervosa. BN is characterized by binge eating, self-induced vomiting or excessive exercise.  To test the hypothesis that treatment with OLB together with exercise vs. exercise alone would induce feedback action of GH, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), peptide   (PYY), and leptin on ghrelin in Czech women with BN and in healthy- Czech women (HW). The lipolysis rate (as glycerol release) in subcutaneous abdominal AT was assessed with microdialysis. At an academic medical center, 12 BN and 12 HW (the control group) were randomized to OLB 500 mg 1 h before a single exercise bout (45 min, 2 W/kg of lean  mass [LBM]) once a week vs. identical placebo over a total of 2 weeks. Blood plasma concentrations of GH, PP, PYY, leptin, ghrelin, FFA, glycerol, and concentrations of AT interstitial glycerol were estimated during the test by RIA utilizing I-labeled tracer, the electrochemiluminescence technique (ECLIA) or colorimetric kits.  OLB administration together with short-term exercise significantly increased plasma GH ( < 0.0001), PP ( < 0.0001), PYY, and leptin concentrations and significantly decreased plasma ghrelin ( < 0.01) concentrations in both groups, whereas short-term exercise with placebo resulted in plasma ghrelin ( < 0.05) decrease exclusively in BN. OLB administration together with short-term exercise significantly lowered local subcutaneous abdominal AT interstitial glycerol ( < 0.0001) to a greater extent in BN.  OLB-induced suppression of plasma ghrelin concentrations together with short-term exercise and after the post-exercise recovering phase suggests a potential negative co-feedback of GH, PP, PYY, and leptin on ghrelin secretion to a greater extent in BN.

Recently, FLT3 inhibitors have been approved for AML therapy. Herein, a series of new compounds with pyrazole amine scaffold was discovered, which showed potent inhibitory activity against FLT3-ITD and significant selectivity against both FLT3-ITD and AML cells expressing FLT3-ITD. Compound 46, possessing the most promising cellular activity, blocked the autophosphorylation of FLT3 pathway in MV4-11 cell line. Furthermore, the apoptosis and downregulation of P-STAT5 were also observed in tumor cells extracted from the MV4-11 cell xenografts model upon compound 46 treatment. Compound 46 was also metabolically stable in vitro and suppressed tumor growth significantly in MV4-11 xenografts model in vivo.

Nintedanib competitively binds to the kinase domains of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Studies in healthy volunteers and in patients with advanced cancer have shown that nintedanib has time-independent pharmacokinetic characteristics. Maximum plasma concentrations of nintedanib are reached approximately 2-4 h after oral administration and thereafter decline at least bi-exponentially. Over the investigated dose range of 50-450 mg once daily and 150-300 mg twice daily, nintedanib exposure increases are dose proportional. Nintedanib is metabolised via hydrolytic ester cleavage, resulting in the formation of the free acid moiety that is subsequently glucuronidated and excreted in the faeces. Less than 1% of drug-related radioactivity is eliminated in urine. The terminal elimination half-life of nintedanib is about 10-15 h. Accumulation after repeated twice-daily dosing is negligible. Sex and renal function have no influence on nintedanib pharmacokinetics, while effects of ethnicity, low , older age and smoking are within the inter-patient variability range of nintedanib exposure and no dose adjustments are required. Administration of nintedanib in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment is not recommended, and patients with mild hepatic impairment should be monitored closely and the dose adjusted accordingly. Nintedanib has a low potential for drug-drug interactions, especially with drugs metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Concomitant treatment with potent inhibitors or inducers of the P-glycoprotein transporter can affect the pharmacokinetics of nintedanib.

However, the direct effect of VSG on metabolic functions is not fully understood. We aimed to investigate if alterations in hypothalamic neurons were linked with perturbations in liver metabolism after VSG in an energy intake-controlled obese mouse model. C57BL/6 and hrNPY-GFP reporter mice received HFD for 12 weeks and were then divided into three groups: Sham (ad lib), sham (pair-fed) with VSG, and VSG. Food intake was measured daily, and blood glucose levels were measured before and after the study. Energy expenditure and  composition were determined. Serum parameters, liver lipid and glycogen contents were measured, and gene/protein expression were analyzed. Hypothalamic POMC, AgRP/NPY, and  hydroxylase expressing neurons were counted. As results, we found that VSG reduced  gain and adiposity induced by HFD, increased energy expenditure independent of energy intake. Fed and fasted blood glucose levels were reduced in the VSG group. While serum active GLP-1 level was increased, the active ghrelin and triglycerides levels were decreased along with improved insulin resistance in VSG group. Liver lipid accumulation, glycogen content, and gluconeogenic gene expression were reduced in the VSG group. In the hypothalamus, TH expressing neuron population was decreased, and the POMC-expressing neuron population was increased in the VSG group. Our data suggests that VSG improves metabolic symptoms by increasing energy expenditure and lowering lipid and glycogen contents in the liver.

Herein, a small dipeptide composed of -(-butoxycarbonyl)pentafluoro-l-phenylalanine and O-benzyl- methyl ester was synthesized, and its gelation ability was investigated in different solvent systems. It was found that the dipeptide was unable to form gel with a single solvent, but a mixture of solvent systems was found to be suitable for the gelation of this dipeptide. Interestingly, water was found to be essential for gelation with the polar protic solvent, and long-chain hydrocarbon units such as, petroleum ether, kerosene, and diesel, were important for gelation with aromatic solvents. The structural insights of these gels were characterized by field-emission scanning electronic microscopy, atomic force microscopy, Fourier transform infrared analysis, and X-ray diffraction studies, and their mechanical strengths were characterized by rheological experiments. Both of the gels obtained from these two solvent systems were thermoreversible in nature, and these translucent gels had potential application for the treatment of waste water.

In addition, we studied palmitate-induced lymphangiogenesis in human kidney-2 (HK2) cells and RAW264.7 monocytes/macrophages, which play a major role in lymphangiogenesis in the kidneys. SAR131475 ameliorated dyslipidemia, albuminuria, and lipid accumulation in the kidneys of db/db mice, with no significant changes in glucose and creatinine levels and . Diabetes-induced systemic inflammation as evidenced by increased systemic monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α level was decreased by SAR131475. SAR131475 ameliorated the accumulation of triglycerides and free fatty acids and reduced inflammation in relation to decreased chemokine expression and pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage infiltration in the kidneys. Downregulation of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 by SAR131475 inhibited lymphatic growth as demonstrated by decreased expression of LYVE-1 and podoplanin that was further accompanied by reduced tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and inflammation in relation to improvement in oxidative stress and apoptosis. Treatment with SAR131475 improved palmitate-induced increase in the expression of VEGF-C, VEGFR-3, and LYVE-1, along with improvement in cytosolic and mitochondrial oxidative stress in RAW264.7 and HK2 cells. Moreover, the enhanced expression of M1 phenotypes in RAW264.7 cells under palmitate stress was reduced by SAR131475 treatment. The results suggest that modulation of lymphatic proliferation in the kidneys is a new treatment approach for type 2 diabetic nephropathy and that SAR131675 is a promising therapy to ameliorate renal damage by reducing lipotoxicity-induced lymphangiogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31236861>Seasonal changes in the chemical composition and reactivity of dissolved organic matter at the land-ocean interface of a subtropical river.</a></h1><p>Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a critical component in aquatic ecosystems, yet its seasonal variability and reactivity remain not well constrained. These were investigated at the land-ocean interface of a subtropical river (Minjiang River, SE China), using absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. The annual export flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the Minjiang River (5.48 × 10 g year) was highest among the rivers adjacent to the Taiwan Strait, with 72% occurring in spring and summer. The freshwater absorption coefficient a, DOC-specific UV absorbance SUVA and humification index HIX were higher, while the spectral slope S and biological index BIX were lower in summer than in winter. This suggests intensified export of terrestrial aromatic and high molecular  constituents in the rainy summer season. Six fluorescent components were identified from 428 samples, including humic-like C1-C3, tryptophan-like C4 and C6, and -like C5. The freshwater levels of four components (C1, C2, C4, and C6) were lower while that of C5 was higher in the wet season than in the dry season, suggesting contrasting seasonal variations of different constituents. Laboratory experiments were performed to assess the effects of photochemical and microbial degradation on DOM. Photo-degradation removed chromophoric and fluorescent DOM (CDOM and FDOM) effectively, which was stronger (i) for high molecular /humic constituents and (ii) during summer under higher solar radiation. Microbial degradation under laboratory controlled conditions generally showed little effect on DOC, and had smaller impact on CDOM and FDOM in winter than in summer. Overall, this study showed notable seasonal changes in the chemical composition and reactivity of DOM at the land-ocean interface, and demonstrated the significant effects of photo-degradation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620204>Placenta-specific protein 8 promotes the proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma PC-9 cells and their tolerance to an epidermal growth factor receptor  kinase inhibitor by activating the ERK signaling pathway.</a></h1><p>Placenta-specific protein 8 (PLAC8) is a conserved protein with a molecular  of 12.5 kDa. The specific function of this protein has not been fully elucidated, however, PLAC8 has been found to play an important tumor regulatory role in certain types of cancer, including colon, pancreatic and liver cancer. PLAC8 also participates in the regulation of the cell cycle, autophagy, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and other cellular functions, indicating its potential as a molecular target worth further investigation. The present study investigated the effect of PLAC8 on the proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma PC-9 cells and their sensitivity to gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor  kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). It was found that the inhibition of PLAC8 expression in PC-9 cells resulted in significantly decreased proliferation, whereas overexpression of PLAC8 significantly increased the proliferation (P<0.05) of PC-9 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of PLAC8 expression resulted in decreased activity of the ERK signaling pathway, while PLAC8 overexpression increased activity of this pathway. Inhibition of the ERK signaling pathway with U0126 reversed the effects induced by inhibiting or overexpressing PLAC8 on cell proliferation. In addition, overexpression of PLAC8 significantly decreased the sensitivity of PC-9 cells to gefitinib, and this effect was reversed by U0126. Overall, these results suggest that PLAC8 is involved in the regulation of proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma PC-9 cells and impacts their sensitivity to an EGFR-TKI. Thus, PLAC8 is a potential novel target in lung adenocarcinoma for future studies.Copyright © 2019, Spandidos Publications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31330021>Association of host genetics with intestinal microbial relevant to  in a chicken F2 resource population.</a></h1><p>Host-microbiota interactions describe a co-evolution and mutualistic symbiosis. Gut microbial communities are important for diverse host functions. However, in birds, the relationship between the composition of the intestinal microbiota and the genetic variation of the host is not clearly understood. To dissect these interactions, a Chinese yellow broiler line (genetically selected for a high growth rate) and Huiyang Beard chickens (low growth rate) were crossed, generating an F2 population. The population structures of the gut microbes in the phenotypically high and low 91-d  individuals of both sexes in the F2 population were studied. Interestingly, a non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that the microbiota of the high- and low- females was clearly separated into 2 clusters. A β-diversity analysis showed that the locus rs16775833 within the doublesex and mab-3-related transcription factor (DMRT) gene cluster accounted for approximately 21% of the variation in the population structure of the gut microbiota. Furthermore, the 2 genetic loci rs15142709 and rs15142674 were significantly associated with specific species of Methanobacterium. These loci are located in the pleiomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1) and lck/yes-related novel  kinase (LYN) genes, which are involved in cell differentiation and growth. This finding suggests evidence for the influence of the host genetics on the composition of the gut microbiota in birds and the importance and utility of the host-microbe status to better understand its effect on the potential growth of birds.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p></html>
