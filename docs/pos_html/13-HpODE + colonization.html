<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11497470>Cultivar-dependent expression of a maize lipoxygenase responsive to seed infesting fungi.</a></h2><p>Maize kernels are highly susceptible to Aspergillus spp. infection and aflatoxin (AF) contamination. Fatty acid signaling molecules appear to mediate the plant-fungal interaction by affecting the growth, development, and AF production of the fungus. In particular, fatty acid derivatives of the plant lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway are implicated in the Aspergillus spp.-seed interaction. The 9(S)-hydroperoxide derivative of linoleic acid promotes transcription of AF genes, whereas the 13(S)-hydroperoxide derivative decreases AF gene expression and production; both are sporulation factors. Our goal was to identify LOX genes responsive to Aspergillus spp.  and determine their specificities, 9(S)- or 13(S)-. Screening maize LOX expressed sequence tags (ESTs) identified one clone, cssap 92, which is highly expressed in Aspergillus spp.-infected seed susceptible to AF contamination and repressed in lines with resistance to AF contamination. The accumulation of cssap 92 transcript was similar during Fusarium spp. infection. The cDNA clone has 94% identity to the previously described L2 LOX gene from maize. Product-specificity analysis of the CSSAP 92 protein shows that it preferentially adds oxygen to carbon 9 of linoleic acid. Because 9(S)-hydroperoxy linoleic acid has been implicated as an aflatoxin-signaling molecule, it is possible that cssap 92 could be used as a biomarker that is indicative of AF resistance in maize lines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10427064>Sporogenic effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids on development of Aspergillus spp.</a></h2><p>Aspergillus spp. are frequently occurring seed-colonizing fungi that complete their disease cycles through the development of asexual spores, which function as inocula, and through the formation of cleistothecia and sclerotia. We found that development of all three of these structures in Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus parasiticus is affected by linoleic acid and light. The specific morphological effects of linoleic acid include induction of precocious and increased asexual spore development in A. flavus and A. parasiticus strains and altered sclerotium production in some A. flavus strains in which sclerotium production decreases in the light but increases in the dark. In A. nidulans, both asexual spore production and sexual spore production were altered by linoleic acid. Spore development was induced in all three species by hydroperoxylinoleic acids, which are linoleic acid derivatives that are produced during fungal  of seeds. The sporogenic effects of these linoleic compounds on A. nidulans are similar to the sporogenic effects of A. nidulans psi factor, an endogenous mixture of hydroxylinoleic acid moieties. Light treatments also significantly increased asexual spore production in all three species. The sporogenic effects of light, linoleic acid, and linoleic acid derivatives on A. nidulans required an intact veA gene. The sporogenic effects of light and linoleic acid on Aspergillus spp., as well as members of other fungal genera, suggest that these factors may be significant environmental signals for fungal development.</p></html>
