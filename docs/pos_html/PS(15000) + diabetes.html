A 10-year follow-up study.</a></h2><p>In established acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with major complications (i.e. heart failure), overweight/obese patients usually have a survival advantage. To what extent this is irrespective of other characteristics remains inconclusive. The role of body mass index (BMI) in ACS prognosis (fatal/recurrent non-fatal cardiac episodes) and background potential interactions were evaluated.In 2006-2009, 1000 consecutive patients, hospitalized at First Cardiology Clinic of Athens with a diagnosis of ACS were enrolled in the study. All patients were classified according to heart failure phenotypes. One-month, 1-, 2- and 10-year follow-up examinations were performed (75% participation rate).Overweight was defined as 25≤BMI≤29.9kg/m2 and  as BMI >29.9kg/m2.BMI status and 10-year ACS prognosis followed a J-shape association (p=.009). Overweight patients had significantly better ACS prognosis than their normal-weight counterparts (OR=.45, 95% CI (.23, .90)). Significant interactions were observed between sociodemographic, clinical and lifestyle parameters and BMI on 10-year ACS prognosis (all  for interaction≤10%); the aforementioned paradoxical association was retained only in patients who: were female (OR=.37, 95% CI (.16, .82)); were aged ≤65 years (OR=.25, 95% CI (.09, .69)), HFrEF (OR=.35, 95% CI (.13, .89)); were hypercholesterolemic (OR=.23, 95% CI (.07, .81)); had no hypertension (OR=.31, 95% CI (.12, .82)) or diabetes mellitus (OR=.29, 95% CI (.09, .95)); had moderate/high adherence to a Mediterranean diet (OR=.43, 95% CI (.22, .86)); and were physically active (OR=.37, 95% CI (., .88)).Although the overweight paradox was observed in the 10-year ACS prognosis of heart failure patients, this paradoxical association was not the case for all.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The patients had new-onset  during 1999-2005 and were followed up until December 31, 2011. An unmatched cohort of 147,729 ever users and ,676 never users of metformin were identified, and a matched-pair cohort of ,676 ever users and ,676 never users was created by propensity score (). Hazard ratios were estimated by Cox regression incorporated with the inverse probability of treatment weighting using . Results showed that in the unmatched cohort, 713 never users and 3943 ever users developed dementia with respective incidence of 1029.20 and 570.03 per 100,000 person-years. The overall hazard ratio was .550 (95% confidence interval: .508-.596). The hazard ratio for the first (<27. months), second (27.-58.1 months) and third (>58.1 months) tertile of cumulative duration of metformin therapy was .975 (.893-1.066), .554 (.506-.607) and .286 (.259-.315), respectively. Analyses in the matched cohort showed an overall hazard ratio of .707 (.632-.791) and the hazard ratio for the respective tertile was 1.279 (1.100-1.488), .704 (.598-.829) and .387 (.320-.468). In conclusion, metformin use is associated with a reduced dementia risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27765729>Infection With Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 3 Is an Independent Risk Factor for End-Stage Liver Disease, Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and Liver-Related Death.</a></h2><p>Few studies have examined factors associated with disease progression in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We examined the association of 11 risk factors with adverse outcomes in a population-based prospective cohort observational study of Alaska Native/American Indian persons with chronic HCV infection.We collected data from a population-based cohort study of liver-related adverse outcomes of infection in American Indian/Alaska Native persons with chronic HCV living in Alaska, recruited from 1995 through 2012. We calculated adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for end-stage liver disease (ESLD; presence of ascites, esophageal varices, hepatic encephalopathy, or coagulopathy), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver-related death using a Cox proportional hazards model.We enrolled 1080 participants followed up for 11,171 person-years (mean, 10.3 person-years); 66%, 19%, and 14% were infected with HCV genotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. On multivariate analysis, persons infected with HCV genotype 3 had a significantly increased risk of developing all 3 adverse outcomes. Their aHR for ESLD was 2.1 (95% CI, 1.5-3.), their aHR for HCC was 3.1 (95% CI, 1.4-6.6), and their aHR for liver-related death was 2.4 (95% CI, 1.5-4.) compared with genotype 1. Heavy alcohol use was an age-adjusted risk factor for ESLD (aHR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6-3.2), and liver-related death (aHR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.8-4.6).  was a risk factor for ESLD (aHR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.-1.9), and diabetes was a risk factor for ESLD (aHR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.2). Male sex was a risk factor for HCC (aHR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.6-8.2).In a population-based cohort study of American Indian/Alaska Native persons with chronic HCV infection, we found those infected with HCV genotype 3 to be at high risk for ESLD, HCC, and liver-related death.Copyright © 2017 AGA Institute.

Yet, it is unclear if these pressures are associated with emotional eating or if specific sources of pressure are differentially associated with emotional eating. We studied the associations between multiple sources of appearance-related pressures, including pressure to be thin and pressure to increase muscularity, and emotional eating in 300 adolescents (M=.3, SD=1.4, 60% female). Controlling for age, race, puberty, body mass index (BMI) z-score, and sex, both pressure to be thin and pressure to be more muscular from same-sex peers were positively associated with emotional eating in response to feeling angry/frustrated and unsettled (<.05). Pressure from same-sex peers to be more muscular also was associated with eating when depressed (p<.05), and muscularity pressure from opposite-sex peers related to eating in response to anger/frustration (p<.05). All associations were fully mediated by internalization of appearance ideals according to Western cultural standards (<.001). Associations of pressures from mothers and fathers with emotional eating were non-significant. Results considering sex as a moderator of the associations between appearance-related pressures and emotional eating were non-significant. Findings illustrate that both pressure to be thin and muscular from peers are related to more frequent emotional eating among both boys and girls, and these associations are explained through internalization of appearance-related ideals.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The primary endpoint was the risk of a composite cardiovascular (CV) outcome (hospitalization for myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, or coronary revascularization). We estimated pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), controlling for >100 baseline characteristics.Patient characteristics were well balanced after -matching. The mean age was 55 years and mean follow-up was .8 years. Linagliptin conferred a similar risk of the composite CV outcome compared to other DPP-4 inhibitors (HR .91, 95% CI .79-1.05) and pioglitazone (HR .98, 95% CI .84-1.), and showed a reduced risk of CV outcomes compared to second-generation sulphonylureas (HR .76, 95% CI .64--.92). Key findings were signalled at the first interim analysis in June 2013 and solidified during ongoing monitoring until 2015.Analyses from a large monitoring programme in routine care of patients with T2D, showed that linagliptin had similar CV safety compared to other DPP-4 inhibitors and pioglitazone, and a reduced CV risk compared to sulphonylureas.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26710892>Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy as an alternative to systemic antibiotics: results from a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical study on type 2 diabetics.</a></h2><p>This double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study compared multiple applications of the antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) treatment protocol, to systemic doxycycline as adjuvant to scaling and root planing (SRP) on type 2 diabetic patients on clinical, systemic and immune-inflammatory outcomes.Thirty patients with Hba1c >7% were allocated in two groups, SRP + Doxy (n = ) using systemic doxycycline 100 mg/day (14 days) and SRP + aPDT (n = ) with multiple applications (, 3, 7 and 14 days). Primary outcome was glycated haemoglobin levels (HbA1c). Clinical parameters: plaque score (), bleeding on probe, probing depth, suppuration, gingival recession, and clinical attachment level, percentage of pockets with desired clinical endpoint were measured at baseline and 3 months after therapy. Cytokine profile was assessed at , 1 and 3 month to measure IL1-β, TNF-α and TGF-β on gingival crevicular fluid.No significant difference was detected on HbA1c, between treatments. The SRP + aPDT group showed advantage on reducing moderate pockets in single-rooted teeth at 3 months. SRP + aPDT presented better results at 3 months on IL1-β levels. There were no significant differences between TNF-α and TGF-β.Both treatments improved clinical and systemic outcomes (Hba1c). SRP + aPDT performed better in moderate probing pocket depth on single-rooted teeth, reduced favourably inflammation in short term, and may be an alternative to systemic antibiotics.

The diabetic patients were classified into three groups; 44 normoalbuminurics, 44 microalbuminurics and 44 macroalbuminurics. Data were obtained from questionnaire interview, and biochemical analysis of blood and urine samples. Patients and controls were matched for age and body mass index (BMI).Serum leptin was significantly higher in micro- and macro-albuminuric patients (14.6 ± 11.7 and .6 ± 13.5 ng/ml) than controls and normoalbuminurics (5.9 ± 4. and 8.1 ± 7.6 ng/ml) with P < .05. In general, serum glucose, urea, createnine, cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), urinary albumin and albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) were increased in diabetic groups compared to non-diabetics, and reaching their maximum increase in macroalbuminurics whereas high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), urinary creatinine and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were decreased reaching its maximum decrease in macroalbuminurics.

Unpublished studies were identified via direct contact with participating investigators.Prospective diagnostic accuracy studies that compared coronary CTA with coronary angiography as the reference standard, using at least a 50% diameter reduction as a cutoff value for obstructive CAD. All patients needed to have a clinical indication for coronary angiography due to suspected CAD, and both tests had to be performed in all patients. Results had to be provided using 2×2 or 3×2 cross tabulations for the comparison of CTA with coronary angiography. Primary outcomes were the positive and negative predictive values of CTA as a function of clinical pretest probability of obstructive CAD, analysed by a generalised linear mixed model; calculations were performed including and excluding non-diagnostic CTA results. The no-treat/treat threshold model was used to determine the range of appropriate pretest probabilities for CTA. The threshold model was based on obtained post-test probabilities of less than % in case of negative CTA and above 50% in case of positive CTA. Sex, angina pectoris type, age, and number of computed tomography detector rows were used as clinical variables to analyse the diagnostic performance in relevant subgroups.Individual patient data from 5332 patients from 65 prospective diagnostic accuracy studies were retrieved. For a pretest probability range of 7-67%, the treat threshold of more than 50% and the no-treat threshold of less than % post-test probability were obtained using CTA. At a pretest probability of 7%, the positive predictive value of CTA was 50.9% (95% confidence interval 43.3% to 57.7%) and the negative predictive value of CTA was 97.8% (96.4% to 98.7%); corresponding values at a pretest probability of 67% were 82.7% (78.3% to 86.2%) and 85.% (80.2% to 88.9%), respectively. The overall sensitivity of CTA was 95.2% (92.6% to 96.9%) and the specificity was 79.2% (74.9% to 82.9%). CTA using more than 64 detector rows was associated with a higher empirical sensitivity than CTA using up to 64 rows (93.4%  86.5%, P=.002) and specificity (84.4%  72.6%, P<.001). The area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve for CTA was .897 (.889 to .906), and the diagnostic performance of CTA was slightly lower in women than in with men (area under the curve .874 (.858 to .890)  .907 (.897 to .916), P<.001). The diagnostic performance of CTA was slightly lower in patients older than 75 (.864 (.834 to .894), P=.018  all other age groups) and was not significantly influenced by angina pectoris type (typical angina .895 (.873 to .917), atypical angina .898 (.884 to .913), non-anginal chest pain .884 (.870 to .899), other chest discomfort .915 (.897 to .934)).In a no-treat/treat threshold model, the diagnosis of obstructive CAD using coronary CTA in patients with stable chest pain was most accurate when the clinical pretest probability was between 7% and 67%. Performance of CTA was not influenced by the angina pectoris type and was slightly higher in men and lower in older patients.PROSPERO CRD42012002780.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

DM was induced by a single injection of streptozotocin at 60 mg/kg on day  of experimentation. Diabetic status was assessed on day 3 of the experimentation. The responses on both tactile and thermal stimuli were assessed on day  (baseline), day 14 (pre-intervention), and day 22 (post-intervention). Ifenprodil was given intrathecally for 7 days from day  until day 21. On day 23, 5% formalin was injected into the rats' hind paw and the nociceptive responses were recorded for 1 hour. The rats were sacrificed 72 hours post-formalin injection and an analysis of the spinal NR2B expression was performed.DM rats showed a significant reduction in pain threshold in response to the tactile and thermal stimuli and higher nociceptive response during the formalin test accompanied by the higher expression of phosphorylated spinal NR2B in both sides of the spinal cord. Ifenprodil treatment for both doses showed anti-allodynic and anti-nociceptive effects with lower expression of phosphorylated and total spinal NR2B.We suggest that the pain process in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat that has been modulated is associated with the higher phosphorylation of the spinal NR2B expression in the development of PDN, which is similar to other models of neuropathic rats.Copyright © 2019 Korean  Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31086609>Maternal dietary glycaemic change during gestation influences insulin-related gene methylation in the placental tissue: a genome-wide methylation analysis.</a></h2><p>Studies have shown that the effects of maternal nutrition exposure during gestation influence metabolic risk in early life through an epigenetic mechanism. Low glycaemic index (GI) diets benefit both maternal and neonatal gestational outcomes. We hypothesize that maternal dietary GI or glycaemic load (GL) changes during pregnancy impact placental DNA methylation, especially in insulin resistance-related genes.From a clinical trial of overweight pregnant women, 12 subjects who successfully reduced their GI and another 12 whose GI increased despite the intervention were selected. A genome-wide differential methylation analysis of placental tissue DNA was conducted, followed by bioinformatic annotation and validation analysis. The distribution of genome-wide differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and CpG sites was described. Six CpG sites in regulatory regions of four insulin-related genes (, , , and ) were selectively validated by pyrosequencing. Pairwise Spearman correlation analysis was performed to test methylation-phenotype association in an additional 153 subjects from the same trial. Correlation between methylation of significant sites and placental mRNA expression of  was also analysed.Dietary GI decreased by 24.3 (26.2-20.1) in the group who responded appropriately to the intervention and increased by 19.6 (.2-29.1) in the comparison group. Epigenome-wide analysis identified 108 DMRs and 365 CpG sites with  < .05 adjusted by false discovery rate, distributed over all chromosomes. The methylation level of cg05009389 in the 3' UTR of  was negatively correlated with maternal weight gain ( = - .21,  = .027) and increase in insulin levels ( = - .24,  = .015) during gestation. Methylation levels of cg17586860 and cg18197392 in the 5' UTR region of  were negatively correlated with changes in dietary carbohydrate intake ( = - .24, s ≤ .006) and GL across gestation ( = - .23, s ≤ .008). This correlation survived the adjustment for maternal factors such as dietary GI, body mass index, and gestational . Up to 89% of cg18197392 methylation was explained by GL change. Cg14631053 methylation correlated positively with mRNA expression of  in the placenta ( = .20,  = .037)We provide the first evidence that maternal dietary GI changes during gestation may impact placental DNA methylation of insulin regulation genes. This supports the hypothesis that placental methylation may be the epigenetic mechanism through which maternal diet influences the metabolic health of offspring.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982924>A High-Fiber Diet Decreases Postabsorptive Protein Turnover but Does Not Alter Insulin Sensitivity in Men with Type 1  Mellitus.</a></h2><p>High-fiber diets (HFDs) are recommended in the diet of persons with , yet such diets can impair macronutrient digestion and/or absorption, modify insulin sensitivity, and reset metabolism.We studied the effects of a HFD on the kinetics of whole-body protein, a macronutrient that could be affected by dietary fiber, in type 1  mellitus (T1DM), under both basal-low insulinemic and hyperinsulinemic conditions.Eight men with T1DM (body mass index range: 21.8-27.8 kg/m2) were studied twice - before and after the addition of guar gum (∼ g/d) to their usual diet for ∼4 mo. Whole-body protein degradation (i.e., the rate of appearance [Ra] of endogenous leucine), leucine disposal to protein synthesis (), deamination, and reamination, were determined before and after the HFD, both in the postabsorptive state and following a euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic, hyperaminoacidemic clamp, using isotope dilution methods.After the HFD, mean values (± SEs) for postabsorptive leucine Ra decreased by ∼20%: from 2.52 (.) to 2.03 (.16) μmol x kg-1 x min-1, P < .049, after vs. before the HFD respectively.  also decreased, by ∼25%: from 2.03 (.) to 1.57 (.), P < .045. Leucine concentration (P = .1) and reamination (P = .095) decreased moderately, whereas deamination was unchanged. Following the clamp, plasma amino acid concentrations (P < .001), leucine deamination (+ ∼50%, P < .00002), reamination (+ ∼30%, P < .0007), and  (+ ∼35%, P < .00001) were all increased compared with postabsorptive state values, whereas endogenous leucine Ra was suppressed (by %, P < .00001, and by 25%, P < .001, with the primary or the reciprocal pool models, respectively). No significant differences in these insulin effects before compared with after the HFD were observed. Metabolic control (glycated hemoglobin), daily insulin requirement, and insulin-mediated glucose disposal were unchanged after the HFD.A HFD downregulates postabsorptive protein turnover in men with T1DM, by decreasing both protein degradation and synthesis, possibly due to a subtle decrease and/or delay in amino acid absorption. It does not significantly affect the insulin (and amino acid sensitivity) to protein turnover, glucose disposal, and metabolic control.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30852091>Thirty-Day Unplanned Reintubation Following Pleurodesis: A Retrospective National Registry Analysis.</a></h2><p>To examine risk factors associated with 30-day unplanned reintubation after pleurodesis.A retrospective cohort study using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program surgical outcomes registry.United States hospitals participating in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program.The study comprised 2,358 patients who underwent video-assisted thorascopic surgery for pleurodesis from 2007 to 2016.None.The final sample included 2,358 cases, of which 93 (3.9%) required 30-day unplanned reintubation.

Data of infants with RDS and age ≤3 days admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) of participated hospitals from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011 were collected by using descriptive epidemiologic survey methodology. The investigation included the basic information of children, perinatal risk factors, clinical manifestations and treatment, complications and prognosis.Of the 17 406 infants admitted to the 20 hospitals under investigation, 580 neonates (3.3%) suffered from RDS and 379 (65.3%) of them were males. Their average gestational age (GA) was (33.±2.9) weeks and birth weight (BW) was (1 956±647)g. The average age of their mothers was (28±5) years, 19 (3.3%) infants with RDS were conceived with assisted reproductive technologies (ART). The selective cesarean section rate of mothers with gestational age ≥ 37 weeks was 59.3 % (51/86). The median duration and cost of the hospitalization were 13 (6., 21.) days and 14 200 (6 800, 23 200) yuan. The common perinatal risk factors in the order of occurrence rate were 33.1% (192/580) cases of birth asphyxia, 19.7% (114 /580) cases of multiple births, 17.8% (103/580) cases of gestational hypertension, .2% (88/580) cases of fetal distress, 13.3% (77/580) cases of premature rupture, 5.7% (33/580) cases of placental abruption, 1.6% (9/580) cases of gestational , 1.4% (8/580) cases of intrahepatic cholestasis in pregnancy; 23.6% (33/140) cases in Gansu were treated with antenatal steroids, 12.1% (8/66) cases in Xinjiang and 9.4% (25/265) cases in Shaanxi. Shaanxi had the highest rate of applying pulmonary surfactant () and intubate-surfactant-extubate to CPAP (INSURE), 61.6% (226/367) and 57.3% (142/248) respectively, but they had the lowest dosage of  (80±43) mg/kg. Hospitals in Shaanxi used CPAP as the major assisted ventilation mode (87.5%, 294/336), with the maximum ventilation duration, the median was 67. (43.7, 108.7) hours. Hospitals in Xinjiang had the lowest rate of applying  and INSURE, 27.3% (18/66) and 19.6% (10/51) cases respectively, but they had the largest dosage of  (170±32) mg/kg. In Xinjiang, conventional mechanical ventilation was used as the major assisted ventilation mode (60.5%, 23/28) and the median of ventilation duration 24. (., 60.) hours was the shortest in the three regions. Hospitals in Gansu had the longest time of using , the median was 24 (7., 24.) hours and also had the highest rate of applying assisted ventilation (94.6%, 139/147). The three regions had significant differences in the application of , mode of assistant ventilation and duration (χ(2)=40.572, 54.271, 29.529, P all<.05). The common complications included hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE, 20.3% (104/513)), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH,14.3%(71/498)), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA, 9.2%(48/522)), pulmonary hemorrhage (6.1%, 32/526), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC, 4.6%(22/476)), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD, 3.4%(17/502)), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL, 2.5%(12/488)), and lung leakage (1.3%, 7/531). The total mortality rate of RDS infants was 14.7% (85/580). Of the 85, 65 died after abandoning of treatment, accounting for 76.5%. The abandoning rate in Xinjiang was much higher (59.1%, 39/66) than those in Shaanxi (8.7%, 32/367) and Gansu (18.4%, 27/147). The difference was statistically significant (χ(2)=21.237, P<.05).The infants with RDS have greater average gestational age and weight. Problems found include incomplete prenatal examination, the high elective cesarean section rate of full-term infants with RDS, the low antepartum application rate of antenatal steroids, the non-standard use of , the low level of using INSURE, inadequate knowledge of complications as well as underdeveloped examination methods. The abandoning of treatment is the major cause of death. Therefore, we suggest that the government should list pulmonary surfactant among the medical insurance covered medicines to lower the rate of the family giving up the RDS infants because of economic difficulties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25906112>Association of hypoglycemia with incident chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes: a nationwide population-based study.</a></h2><p>This article aims to investigate the long-term risk of incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with hypoglycemia.This nationwide, population-based, propensity score ()-matched cohort study involved 2 cohorts: a hypoglycemic cohort and a matched cohort without hypoglycemia. Data from 1.3 million patients with newly diagnosed T2DM between 2000 and 2010 were extracted from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Hypoglycemic events were collected using inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department diagnoses. Patients aged <20 years and those with previous histories of CKD were excluded. The association between hypoglycemia and subsequent CKD risk in patients with T2DM was examined using Cox regression analysis after  matching.During the mean follow-up period of 4.2 years, a total of ,036 (1.7 %) patients experienced at least 1 episode of hypoglycemia and ,036 matched controls without hypoglycemia were identified among 906,368 eligible patients. The incidence rates of subsequent CKD were 26.1 and 14.8 events per 1000 person-years in the hypoglycemic and matched cohorts, respectively. The hazard ratio (HR) of hypoglycemia for incident CKD was 1.77 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.63-1.92; P < .001).

Median age was 79 year(75-93); Male/Female 61/39%, ECOG- -1/2 85/%; /rectum 74/26%; multiple metastatic sites 34%, only liver metastasis in 41% of patients. KRAS status was studied in 35% of patients: 44% of them showed gene mutation. 20.5% of patients did not received any kind of treatment including surgery. Comorbidities observed: cardiovascular 34%, diabetes 14%, hypertension 50%. Primary tumor was resected in 80.6%; surgery of liver metastasis was done in 19% of patients (2.3% of patients >80years). 78% of patients underwent chemotherapy. Median follow up was 12 months(range 1-124). Median OS was 17 months (CI 95%-19);median OS in no-treated patients was 5 months (4-6); mOS of patients with at least one treatment was 20 months (18-22).

Its long-term course in adolescent bariatric surgery patients and associations with weight outcomes are unclear.Adolescents ( = 234; age range = 13-19 years) undergoing bariatric surgery across 5 US sites were assessed for postsurgery follow-up at 6 months and 1, 2, 3, and 4 years. Descriptive statistics and generalized linear mixed models were used to describe the prevalence of LOC eating episodes involving objectively large amounts of food and continuous eating, respectively. Generalized linear mixed models investigated the association of any LOC eating with short- and long-term BMI changes.At baseline, objectively large LOC eating was reported by .4% of adolescents, and continuous LOC eating by 27.8% of adolescents. Both forms of LOC eating were significantly lower at all postsurgical time points relative to presurgery (range = .5%-14.5%; s < .05). However, both behaviors gradually increased from 6-month to 4-year follow-up (s < .05). Presurgical LOC eating was not related to percent BMI change over follow-up ( = .79). However, LOC eating at 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow-up was associated with lower percent BMI change from baseline at the next consecutive assessment (s < .05).Although presurgical LOC eating was not related to relative weight loss after surgery, postoperative LOC eating may adversely affect long-term weight outcomes. Rates of LOC eating decreased from presurgery to 6-months postsurgery but increased thereafter.

Here, we developed a risk score using predialysis nephrology practice data to predict 1-year mortality following the initiation of haemodialysis (HD) for CKD patients.This was a multicenter cohort study involving CKD patients who started HD between April 2006 and March 2011 at 21 institutions with nephrology care services. Patients who had not received predialysis nephrology care at an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of approximately 10 mL/min per 1.73 m2 were excluded. Twenty-nine candidate predictors were selected, and the final model for 1-year mortality was developed via multivariate logistic regression and was internally validated by a bootstrapping technique.A total of 688 patients were enrolled, and 62 (9.%) patients died within one year of HD initiation. The following variables were retained in the final model: eGFR, serum albumin, calcium, Charlson Comorbidity Index excluding  and renal disease (modified CCI), performance status (), and usage of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA). Their β-coefficients were transformed into integer scores: three points were assigned to modified CCI≥3 and  3-4; two to calcium>8.5 mg/dL, modified CCI 1-2, and no use of ESA; and one to albumin<3.5 g/dL, eGFR>7 mL/min per 1.73 m2, and  1-2. Predicted 1-year mortality risk was 2.5% (score -4), 5.5% (score 5-6), .2% (score 7-8), and 28.9% (score 9-12). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was .83 (95% confidence interval, .79-.89).We developed a simple 6-item risk score predicting 1-year mortality after the initiation of HD that might help nephrologists make a shared decision with patients and families regarding the initiation of HD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30206014>Survival and arrhythmic risk among ischemic and non-ischemic heart failure patients with prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator only therapy: A propensity score-matched analysis.</a></h2><p>Concerns about the efficacy of prophylactic ICD in non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) heart failure (HF) patients are still present. We aimed to assess whether survival and arrhythmic risk were different among ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and NICM ICD-only patients, along with specific predictors for mortality.HF patients undergoing ICD-only implant were extracted from the nationwide multicenter UMBRELLA registry. Arrhythmic events were collected by remote monitoring and reviewed by a committee of experts.782 patients (556 ICM; 226 NICM) were recruited: mean ejection fraction of 26.6%; 83.4% in NYHA class II-III; mean QRS duration of 108.9 ms (only 14.9% with QRS > 130 ms). After 4.35 years of mean follow-up, all-cause mortality rate was 4.2%/year. In propensity-score () analysis no survival differences between ICM and NICM subgroups appeared (mortality rates: 19.4% vs. 20%, p = .375). Age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.02, p = .009),  (HR = 2.61, p ≤ .001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR = 2.13, p = .002), and previous HF (HR = 2.28, p = .027) correlated with increased mortality for the entire population, however atrial fibrillation (AF) (HR = 2.68, p = .002) and chronic kidney disease (HR = 3.74, p ≤ .001) emerged as specific predictors in NICM patients. At follow-up, 134 patients (17.1%) were delivered a first appropriate ICD therapy (5.1%/year) without significant differences between ICM and NICM patients in the  analysis (17.6% vs. .8%, p = .968). ICD shocks were associated with a higher mortality (HR = 2.88, p < .001) but longer detection windows (HR = .57, p = .042) correlated with fewer appropriate therapies.Mortality and arrhythmia free survival is similar among ICM and NICM HF patients undergoing ICD-only implant for primary prevention strategy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Studies implicating systemic blood pressure or, more recently, arterial stiffness in the pathophysiology of NTG have produced conflicting results. Our aim was to investigate whether NTG is associated with alterations in the macrocirculation or microcirculation, cardiac function, and peripheral and central hemodynamics. Thirty patients with NTG (mean age 65 years, range 46-79) and 33 healthy subjects (mean age 67 years, range 42-79) matched for age and sex were included in the study. Exclusion criteria (for both cases and controls) were history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, severe hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. Aortic stiffness was measured using carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), central hemodynamics using carotid artery applanation tonometry, and diameter, stiffness, and intima-media thickness (IMT) of the carotid and femoral artery using echo-tracking. Total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) was derived from mean arterial pressure and cardiac index, measured using ultrasound. There were no statistically significant differences in arterial structure nor function between NTG patients and age and sex-matched controls.

Insulin growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling plays a role in growth, survival, and chemoresistance in SCLC. Linsitinib is a potent IGF-1R tyrosine kinase inhibitor that potentially may be active against SCLC.In this phase II study, 8 eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:2 ratio to topotecan (1.5 mg/m intravenously or 2.3 mg/m orally, daily for 5 days for 4 cycles) or linsitinib (150 mg orally twice daily until progression). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Patients with relapsed SCLC, platinum sensitive or resistant, performance status () -2, and adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function were enrolled. Patients with , cirrhosis, and those taking insulinotropic agents were excluded. Crossover to linsitinib was allowed at progression.Fifteen patients received topotecan (8 resistant, 3 with  2) and 29 received linsitinib (16 resistant, 5 with  2). Two partial responses were observed with topotecan. Only 4 of  patients with topotecan and 1 of 29 with linsitinib achieved stable disease. Median progression-free survival was 3.

For advanced UC or metastatic UC (mUC), platinum-based combination chemotherapy is the standard first-line (1L) treatment; however, there is wide heterogeneity of second-line (2L) treatments, ranging from vinflunine in parts of Europe to taxanes and other agents elsewhere in Europe, in the United States and globally. Limited data exist on treatment patterns and outcomes in patients with advanced UC or mUC in the routine clinical setting in Germany. The objective of this study was to describe clinical characteristics, treatment patterns and subsequent outcomes in this setting. : This retrospective observational cohort analysis evaluated 1L and 2L treatment patterns and overall survival (OS) in patients aged ≥18 years with advanced UC or mUC (T4b, N2-3 and/or M1) at office-based urology and academic as well as nonacademic urology clinics throughout Germany between 1 November 2009 and 2 June 2016. Data were obtained through the GermanOncology database and additional treatment centers using similar electronic case report forms. : Among the 435 patients included in the analysis, 435 received 1L treatment and 125 received 2L treatment. Median age at start of 1L treatment was 69 years, 75% of patients were male, 75% were current or ex-smokers, % had hemoglobin <10 g/dL and 44% had creatinine clearance<60 mL/min/1.73; proportions were similar with 2L treatment. Cardiovascular disease was the most frequently reported comorbidity (65%), followed by  (19%). Most patients (77%) received 1L platinum-based combination treatment (most commonly gemcitabine + cisplatin, 83%). Of those treated with 2L treatment, 66% received a single agent (most commonly vinflunine, 71%). Median OS (95% CI) with 1L treatment was 16.1 months (13.7-19.2) overall and 17.7 months (14.4-24.2) with 1L cisplatin + gemcitabine. In the 1L setting, 12-month OS was 61%, 24-month OS was 39% and 36-month OS was 26%. Median (95% CI) OS with 2L treatment was 9.2 months (5.5-11.6) overall and 5.9 months (4.1-12.6) with 2L vinflunine. In the 2L setting, OS rates for the same time periods were 40%, 22% and 8%, respectively. Median (95% CI) progression-free survival was 7 months (6.4-8.1) and 4 months (3.-4.8), respectively, in the 1L and 2L settings. Objective response rates were 34% in the 1L setting and 14% in the 2L setting. No difference in OS by sex or smoking status was noted. Patients with or without renal impairment had a 12-month OS of 54% or 69%, respectively. OS at 12 months was 63% among patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG ) of  to 1 vs 53% among patients with an ECOG  of ≥2. Cox regression analysis found no difference in OS between vinflunine and other 2L treatments ( = .69). : This study provides a contemporary multicenter assessment of real-world treatment patterns and outcomes among palliatively treated patients with UC in Germany. The findings were generally consistent with the poor treatment outcomes observed globally, underscoring the need for effective 1L and 2L treatment for advanced UC or mUC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27532885>The Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Austrians Disease Management Program in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus - A Population-Based Retrospective Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of the Austrian Disease Management Program (DMP) 'Therapie aktiv-Diabetes im Griff' for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus concerning patient-relevant outcomes (mortality, myocardial infarction and stroke) and costs.Based on routine health insurance data, we conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using a propensity score () matched control group design. The DMP-group consists of participants enrolled in the program during 2008 and 2009 (n = 7181). Out of 208.532 patients with no participation in the DMP up to 2013, -matched controls were selected with a matching ratio 1:3. In the -model, patient's characteristics, form of antidiabetic drug therapy, several prescriptions, the number of hospital admissions and days, main discharge diagnoses and costs at baseline were included.Over a follow-up period of four years, we observed a significantly lower mortality rate in the DMP-group (9.4%) in comparison with the control group (.9%, p<.001). The cumulative number of hospital days and mean annual hospital costs were lower for DMP-participants resulting in significantly lower mean annual total costs, amounting to € 8226.80 per patient in the DMP-group and € 9231.10 in the control group respectively (p<.001).The evaluation shows a survival benefit and an average reduction of costs for participants in the DMP compared with the control-group. Despite we took great effort to ensure comparable groups, we cannot entirely rule out an influence by residual and unmeasured confounding due to the observational study design and the use of routine data. However, the results indicate that the disease management program implemented in Austria improves quality of care for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27367614>Impact of newer self-monitoring technology and brief phone-based intervention on weight loss: A randomized pilot study.</a></h2><p>Despite the proliferation of newer self-monitoring technology (e.g., activity monitors and smartphone apps), their impact on weight loss outside of structured in-person behavioral intervention is unknown.A randomized, controlled pilot study was conducted to examine efficacy of self-monitoring technology, with and without phone-based intervention, on 6-month weight loss in adults with overweight and . Eighty participants were randomized to receive standard self-monitoring tools (ST, n = 26), technology-based self-monitoring tools (TECH, n = 27), or technology-based tools combined with phone-based intervention (TECH + PHONE, n = 27). All participants attended one introductory weight loss session and completed assessments at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months.Weight loss from baseline to 6 months differed significantly between groups P = .042; there was a trend for TECH + PHONE (-6.4 ± 1.2 kg) to lose more weight than ST (-1.3 ± 1.2 kg); weight loss in TECH (-4.1 ± 1.4 kg) was between ST and TECH + PHONE. Fewer ST (%) achieved ≥5% weight losses compared with TECH and TECH + PHONE (44%), P = .039. Adherence to self-monitoring caloric intake was higher in TECH + PHONE than TECH or ST,  < .05.These results suggest use of newer self-monitoring technology plus brief phone-based intervention improves adherence and weight loss compared with traditional self-monitoring tools.

The NWCR sample ( = 794) was compared with a demographically similar subsample of 833 individuals answering the same questions in the Pew Tracking for Health Survey.The NWCR had higher rates of tracking weight, diet or exercise using any modality (92.8% vs. 71.3%), on a regular basis (67.4% vs. 41.3%), and frequency of updating records, compared with Pew (s < .01). Smartphone ownership was higher in NWCR participants (80.2% vs. 52.8%,  < .001), and NWCR smartphone owners had 23.1 times greater odds for using diet, food or calorie counter apps (58.9% vs. 5.9%) and .5 times greater odds for using weight monitoring apps (31.7% vs. 3.%; all s < .01). Pew respondents more often changed their behaviour based on their tracking data (s < .01).Use of self-monitoring technology is common in weight loss maintainers: more so than in a nationally representative sample. However, the national sample more often changed their behaviour based on tracking data, perhaps suggesting that weight loss maintainers could derive additional benefit from technology they are already using.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28118262>Permanent Atrial Fibrillation and 2 Year Clinical Outcomes in Patients with a Left Ventricular Assist Device Implant.</a></h2><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) may increase the risk of thromboembolic (TE) complications in patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). In a single-center study, we investigated 205 patients with sinus rhythm (SR group) and 117 patients with AF (AF group). Our main read outs were 2 year overall survival (primary end point), perioperative right heart failure (RHF), and 2 year freedom from stroke, pump thrombosis, and gastrointestinal bleeding (secondary end points). Oral anticoagulation was performed with phenprocoumon (international normalized ratio target range: 2.3-2.8) and aspirin (100 mg/day). Propensity score () adjustment was used for statistical analysis. Two year survival was 65.4% (n = 134) in the SR group and 51.3% (n = 60) in the AF group. The -adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 2 year mortality was higher in the AF group than in the SR group (HR = 1.48 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-2.; p = .038]). Right heart failure was a more frequent cause of death in the AF group than in the SR group (p = .008). The -adjusted odds ratio of perioperative RHF was for the AF group (reference: SR group) 1.32 (95% CI: .80-2.18; p = .280). The -adjusted 2 year HRs of TE and bleeding events were comparable between both groups and were for stroke, pump thrombosis, and gastrointestinal bleeding (reference: SR group) .90 (95% CI: .53-1.55; p = .714), .76 (95% CI: .14-4.31; p = .639), and 1.01 (95% CI: .60-1.70; p = .978), respectively. Our data indicate that AF increases midterm mortality, but does not influence the risk of stroke, pump thrombosis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The higher midterm mortality in AF patients is most likely disease-related and should have no influence on LVAD implantation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26021978>Effects of  and gestational diabetes mellitus on placental phospholipids.</a></h2><p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with adverse effects in the offspring. The composition of placental glycerophospholipids (GPL) is known to be altered in GDM and might reflect an aberrant fatty acid transfer across the placenta and thus affect the foetal body composition. The aim of this study was to investigate possible effects of  and GDM, respectively, on placental GPL species composition. We investigated molecular species of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine () in term placentas from controls (lean non-diabetic, body-mass-index [BMI] 18-24.9k g/m(2), n=31), obese non-diabetics (BMI ≥30 kg/m(2), n=17) and lean diabetics (n=), using liquid chromatography - triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. PE(16:/22:6) and PE(18:/20:4) were increased in GDM and decreased species were PC(18:/20:3), PC(18:1/20:3) and (18:/18:2). A consistent difference between BMI related changes and changes caused by GDM was not observed. Arachidonic acid percentages of cord blood correlated with placental PC(16:/20:4), whereas foetal docosahexaenoic acid correlated to placental PE species. Furthermore, a positive correlation of placental weight was found to levels of PE containing arachidonic acid. We demonstrated that  and GDM are associated with decreased dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid and increased arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid contents of placental GPL, with unknown consequences for the foetus. PC(16:/20:4) was identified as the major component for the supply of arachidonic acid to the foetal circulation, whereas PE containing arachidonic acid was found to be associated to the placental and infant growth.ClinicalTrials.gov .Copyright © 2015.

We aimed to examine the association between thiazolidinediones, PPAR-γ agonists and incidence of bacterial abscess among patients with type 2 .This retrospective cohort study between 2000 and 2010 included 46 986 propensity ()-matched patients diagnosed with type 2 . We compared the incidence of bacterial abscess, including liver and non-liver abscesses, between patients treated with metformin plus a thiazolidinedione (M + T, N = 7831) or metformin plus a sulfonylurea (M + S, N = 39 155). Data were retrieved from a population-based Taiwanese database. We applied Cox proportional hazard regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), comparing M + T and M + S after  matching.During a median follow-up of 4.5 years, the incidence rate of bacterial abscess was lower with M + T than with M + S treatment (1.89 vs 3. per 1000 person-years) in the -matched cohort. M + T was associated with a reduced risk of bacterial abscess (HRs after  matching, .58; 95% CI, .42-.80 for total bacterial abscess; .54; 95% CI, .28-1.07 for liver abscess; .59; 95% CI, .41-.85 for non-liver abscess). Results did not change materially after accounting for unmeasured confounding factors using high-dimenional  matching and differential censoring between regimen groups. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, in combination with metformin, produced similar reductions in risk of all abscess outcomes.We found that M + T may provide a protective benefit in reducing the incidence of bacterial abscesses.

We sought to examine long-term donation effects on 3 psychosocial domains: perceived physical, emotional, and socioeconomic outcomes.Individuals donating 3 to 10 years previously at 9 centers were eligible for telephone surveys. Survey responses were examined descriptively. Cluster analysis was used to identify distinct donor groups based on response profiles across psychosocial domains. Potential predictors of response profiles were evaluated with regression analysis.Five hundred seventeen donors (66%) participated (M = 5.8 years postdonation, SD = 1.9). Fifteen percent to 48% of donors endorsed current donation-related physical health problems and concerns, and 7%-60% reported socioeconomic concerns (eg, insurance difficulties, financial expenditures). However, on average, donors experienced high psychological growth, and 90% felt positively about donation. Cluster analysis revealed 5 donor groups. One group showed high psychological benefit, with little endorsement of physical or socioeconomic concerns (% of donors). Four groups showed less favorable profiles, with varying combinations of difficulties. The largest such group showed high endorsement of physical concerns and financial expenditures, and only modest psychological benefit (31% of donors). Men and nonHispanic whites were most likely to have unfavorable response profiles ( < .01). Compared with donors aged 19 to 30 years, older donors were less likely to have unfavorable profiles; these differences were significant for donors in the >40 to 50 year age group ( < .008).Even many years postdonation, donors report adverse physical and socioeconomic effects, but positive emotional effects as well. Identification of response profiles and predictors may improve targeting of postdonation surveillance and care.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25501064>Pre-existing type 2  mellitus is an independent risk factor for mortality and progression in patients with renal cell carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Malignancies are one of the main causes of mortality in diabetic patients; however, to date, very limited data have been reported on the specific influence of type 2  mellitus (T2DM) on the survival of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In the present long-term retrospective study, we investigated whether T2DM may influence the overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with surgically treated RCC. Medical records of 924 patients treated by radical or partial nephrectomy for sporadic, unilateral RCC were reviewed. Patients with type-1 DM and with T2 DM receiving insulin treatment were excluded. Survival estimates were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using the Cox regression model.Of the 924 RCC patients, 152 (16.5%) had T2DM. Mean follow-up was 68.5 months. Mean OS was 41.3 and 96.3 months in T2DM and non-T2DM patients, respectively (P < .0001).The estimated CSS rates at 1, 3, and 5 years in T2DM versus non-T2DM patients were 63.4% versus 76.7%, 30.4% versus 56.6%, and 16.3% versus 48.6%, respectively (P = .001). Mean PFS was significantly lower (31.5 vs 96.3 months; P < .0001) in the T2DM group. At multivariate analysis, T2DM was an independent adverse prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio [HR]  = 3.44; 95% confidence interval [CI]:2.40-4.92), CSS (HR = 6.39; 95% CI: 3.78-10.79), and PFS (HR = 4.71; 95% CI: 3.11-7.). In conclusion, our findings suggest that patients with RCC and pre-existing T2DM have a shorter OS, increased risk of recurrence, and higher risk for kidney cancer mortality than those without .</p></html>
