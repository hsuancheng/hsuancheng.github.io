Because endogenous bile  and steroidal ligands, which cover the same chemical space of bile , often target both receptor families, speculation on nonsteroidal ligands represents a promising and innovative strategy to selectively target GPBAR1 or FXR.In this review, we summarize the most recent acquisition on natural, semisynthetic, and synthetic steroidal and nonsteroidal ligands, able to interact with FXR and GPBAR1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31393787>Exogenous PP2A inhibitor exacerbates the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease via NOX2-dependent activation of miR21.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an emerging global pandemic. Though significant progress has been made in unraveling the pathophysiology of the disease, the role of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and its subsequent inhibition by environmental and genetic factors in NAFLD pathophysiology remains unclear. The present report tests the hypothesis that an exogenous PP2A inhibitor leads to hepatic inflammation and fibrogenesis via an NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2)-dependent pathway in NAFLD. Results showed that microcystin (MC) administration, a potent PP2A inhibitor found in environmental exposure, led to an exacerbation of NAFLD pathology with increased  immunoreactivity, the release of proinflammatory cytokines, and stellate cell activation, a process that was attenuated in mice that lacked the  gene and miR21 knockout mice. Mechanistically, leptin-primed immortalized Kupffer cells (a mimicked model for an NAFLD condition) treated with apocynin or nitrone spin trap 5,5 dimethyl-1- pyrroline -oxide (DMPO) had significantly decreased  and decreased miR21 and α-smooth muscle actin levels, suggesting the role of NOX2-dependent reactive oxygen species in miR21-induced Kupffer cell activation and stellate cell pathology. Furthermore, NOX2-dependent peroxynitrite generation was primarily responsible for cellular events observed following MC exposure since incubation with phenylboronic  attenuated miR21 levels, Kupffer cell activation, and inflammatory cytokine release. Furthermore, blocking of the AKT pathway attenuated PP2A inhibitor-induced NOX2 activation and miR21 upregulation. Taken together, we show that PP2A may have protective roles, and its inhibition exacerbates NAFLD pathology via activating NOX2-dependent peroxynitrite generation, thus increasing miR21-induced pathology. Protein phosphatase 2A inhibition causes nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () progression via NADPH oxidase 2. In addition to a novel emchanism of action, we describe a new tool to describe  histopathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31197565>Nonsteroidal FXR Ligands: Current Status and Clinical Applications.</a></h2><p>FXR agonists have demonstrated very promising clinical results in the treatment of liver disorders such as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). , in particular, is one of the last uncharted white territories in the pharma landscape, and there is a huge medical need and a large potential pharmaceutical market for a  pharmacotherapy. Clinical efficacy superior to most other treatment options was shown by FXR agonists such as obeticholic  (OCA) as they improved various metabolic features including liver steatosis as well as liver inflammation and fibrosis. But OCA's clinical success comes with some major liabilities such as pruritus, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) lowering, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) increase, and a potential for drug-induced liver toxicity. Some of these effects can be attributed to on-target effects exerted by FXR, but with others it is not clear whether it is FXR- or OCA-related. Therefore a quest for novel, proprietary FXR agonists is ongoing with the aim to increase FXR potency and selectivity over other proteins and to overcome at least some of the OCA-associated clinical side effects through an improved pharmacology. In this chapter we will discuss the historical and ongoing efforts in the identification and development of nonsteroidal, which largely means non-bile -type, FXR agonists for clinical use.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634532>Impact of Obeticholic  on the Lipoprotein Profile in Patients with Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist, obeticholic  (OCA), increases total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). The present study evaluated the impact of OCA therapy on lipoprotein sub-particles.The study included 196 patients (99 OCA group and 97 placebo) who were enrolled in the FLINT trial and had samples available for lipid analysis and liver biopsies at enrollment and end-of-treatment (EOT) at 72 weeks. Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles were evaluated at baseline, 12 and 72 weeks after randomization, and 24 weeks following EOT.Baseline lipoprotein profiles were similar among OCA and placebo. OCA did not impact total VLDL particle concentrations, but OCA vs placebo treatment was associated with decreased large VLDL particle concentration at 12 weeks (baseline adjusted mean: 6.8 vs. 8.9 nmol/L; P=0.002), mirrored by an increase in less-atherogenic small VLDL particle concentration (33.9 vs. 28.0 nmol/L; P=0.02). After 12 weeks, total LDL particle concentration was higher among OCA vs. placebo (1667 vs. 1329 nmol/L; P<0.0001), characterized by corresponding increases in both less-atherogenic, large-buoyant LDL (475 vs. 308 nmol/L; P=<0.001) and more-atherogenic small-dense LDL particles (1015 vs. 872 nmol/L; P=0.002). The changes in LDL particle concentrations were similar between treatment groups (OCA and placebo) 24 weeks following EOT due to improvement in OCA cohort. Compared to placebo, a reduction in total HDL-particle concentration, particularly large and medium HDL-particles, was noted in the OCA treated patients but this resolved after drug discontinuation.OCA therapy is associated with increases at 12 weeks in small VLDL particles and large and small LDL particles and reduction in HDL particles which revert to baseline 24 weeks after drug discontinuation. Lay Summary: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is a chronic liver disease that is associated with increased risk of developing cirrhosis and cardiovascular disease. Recently, obeticholic  (OCA), a farnesoid X receptor agonist, improved liver disease but led to an increase in cholesterol, however, the impact of OCA on cholesterol is not well understood. In the present study, we present data showing that OCA therapy is associated with an increase in lipoprotein levels which improve after drug discontinuation.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

A large body of clinical and experimental data shows that increased flux of free fatty  from increased visceral adipose tissue and de novo lipogenesis can lead to NAFLD and insulin resistance. Thus, individuals with obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidaemia are at the greatest risk of developing NAFLD. Conversely, NAFLD is a phenotype of cardiometabolic syndrome. Notably, researchers have discovered a close association between NAFLD and impaired glucose metabolism and focused on the role of NAFLD in the development of type 2 diabetes. Moreover, recent studies provide substantial evidence for an association between NAFLD and atherosclerosis and cardiometabolic disorders. Even if NAFLD can progress into severe liver disorders including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () and cirrhosis, the majority of subjects with NAFLD die from cardiovascular disease eventually. In this review, we propose a potential pathological link between NAFLD/ and cardiometabolic syndrome. The potential factors that can play a pivotal role in this link, such as inflammation, insulin resistance, alteration in lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, genetic predisposition, and gut microbiota are discussed.© 2018 World Obesity Federation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30669332>Spirulina Liquid Extract Protects against Fibrosis Related to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis and Increases Ursodeoxycholic .</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () is characterized by an excess of lipids and oxidative stress in the liver. Spirulina was reported to possess hypolipemic and antioxidative effects and might counteract  development. C57Bl/6J mice were fed a western diet (WD) during 25 weeks with or without spirulina liquid extract (SLE) at 2 different doses (WDS1 and WDS2 groups) in drinking water. Liver histology, inflammation, and oxidative stress were assessed as well as glucose tolerance status, lipid metabolism, and gallbladder bile  profile. WDS2 gained significantly less weight than WD. Liver weight-to-body weight ratio and plasma alanine aminotransferase were significantly lower in WDS2 mice. A reduced liver fibrosis and NFκBp65 protein expression were measured in the supplemented group as a lower accumulation of superoxide anion, nitric oxide, and thiobarbituric reactive substances. WDS2 mice showed also a preserved glucose tolerance, a strong decrease of plasma cholesterol, and a significant increase of gallbladder ursodeoxycholic  and β-muricholic . Our findings demonstrate a protective effect of SLE against WD induced  that is related to less inflammation and oxidative stress, a preserved glucose tolerance, and less hepatotoxic bile  profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30936549>Platelet GPIbα is a mediator and potential interventional target for  and subsequent liver cancer.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ranges from steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), potentially progressing to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we show that platelet number, platelet activation and platelet aggregation are increased in  but not in steatosis or insulin resistance. Antiplatelet therapy (APT; aspirin/clopidogrel, ticagrelor) but not nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment with sulindac prevented  and subsequent HCC development. Intravital microscopy showed that liver colonization by platelets depended primarily on Kupffer cells at early and late stages of , involving hyaluronan-CD44 binding. APT reduced intrahepatic platelet accumulation and the frequency of platelet-immune cell interaction, thereby limiting hepatic immune cell trafficking. Consequently, intrahepatic cytokine and chemokine release, macrovesicular steatosis and liver damage were attenuated. Platelet cargo, platelet adhesion and platelet activation but not platelet aggregation were identified as pivotal for  and subsequent hepatocarcinogenesis. In particular, platelet-derived GPIbα proved critical for development of  and subsequent HCC, independent of its reported cognate ligands vWF, P-selectin or Mac-1, offering a potential target against .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671697>Why Bile  Are So Important in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Progression.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a complex disease, affecting not just the liver, but also all other organs in the body. Despite an increasing amount of people worldwide developing NAFLD and having it progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and potentially cirrhosis, there is still no approved therapy. Therefore, huge efforts are being made to find and develop a successful treatment. One of the special interests is understanding the liver-gut axis and especially the role of bile  in the progression of NAFLD. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-agonists have been approved und used in other liver diseases, such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and have shown signs of being able to decrease inflammation and potentially steatosis. This review will mainly focus on targets/ligands that play an important role in bile  metabolism and give an overview of ongoing clinical as well as pre-clinical trials.

Strongly associated with obesity and the metabolic syndrome, the pathogenesis of NAFLD is dependent on complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors that are not completely understood. Weight loss through diet and lifestyle modification underpins clinical management; however, the roles of individual dietary nutrients (e.g. saturated and n-3 fatty ; fructose, vitamin D, vitamin E) in the pathogenesis or treatment of NAFLD are only partially understood. Systems biology offers valuable interdisciplinary methods that are arguably ideal for application to the studying of chronic diseases such as NAFLD, and the roles of nutrition and diet in their molecular pathogenesis. Although present in silico models are incomplete, computational tools are rapidly evolving and human metabolism can now be simulated at the genome scale. This paper will review NAFLD and its pathogenesis, including the roles of genetics and nutrition in the development and progression of disease. In addition, the paper introduces the concept of systems biology and reviews recent work utilising genome-scale metabolic networks and developing multi-scale models of liver metabolism relevant to NAFLD. A future is envisioned where individual genetic, proteomic and metabolomic information can be integrated computationally with clinical data, yielding mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of chronic diseases such as NAFLD, and informing personalised nutrition and stratified medicine approaches for improving prognosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30796899>Composition of plasmalogens in serum lipoproteins from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and their susceptibility to oxidation.</a></h2><p>Plasmalogens are ether phospholipids (PL) with an alkenyl group including vinyl ether bound at the sn-1 position and a polyunsaturated fatty  bound at the sn-2 position, and are susceptible to oxidation. To date, there are no reports on the relationship between plasmalogen in serum lipoproteins and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), caused by multiple factors including oxidative stress. Here, we have investigated the distribution of plasmalogens in serum lipoproteins isolated from  patients and healthy volunteers.Serum lipoproteins were separated by gel-filtration chromatography, and analyzed for ethanolamine and choline plasmalogens using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.Both plasmalogen levels were higher in HDL than in VLDL or LDL. The plasmalogens/PL ratio was significantly lower in  than controls, for all lipoprotein fractions. Ethanolamine plasmalogens containing 20:4 and 22:6 at the sn-2 position and choline plasmalogens containing 16:0 at the sn-1 position were predominant in each group.

Consistently, iPla2β deletion protects hepatic steatosis and obesity in genetic ob/ob and obese mice chronically fed with high-fat diet by replenishing the loss of hepatic phospholipids (PL). As mouse feeding with methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet is a model of lean , we tested whether iPla2β-null mice could still be protected since PL syntheses are disturbed. MCD-diet feeding of female wild-type for 5 weeks induced hepatic steatosis with a severe reduction of body and visceral fat weights concomitant with a decrease of hepatic phosphatidylcholine. These parameters were not altered in MCD-fed iPla2β-null mice. However, iPla2β deficiency attenuated MCD-induced elevation of serum transaminase activities and hepatic expression of fatty- translocase Cd36, fatty- binding protein-4, peroxisome-proliferator activated receptorγ, and HDL-uptake scavenger receptor B type 1. The reduction of lipid uptake genes was consistent with a decrease of hepatic esterified and unesterified fatty  and cholesterol esters. On the contrary, iPla2β deficiency under MCD did not have any effects on inflammasomes and pro-inflammatory markers but exacerbated hepatic expression of myofibroblast α-smooth muscle actin and vimentin. Thus, without any rescue of PL loss, iPla2β inactivation attenuated hepatocellular injury in MCD-induced  with a novel mechanism of lipid uptake inhibition. Taken together, we have shown that iPla2β mediates hepatic steatosis and lipotoxicity in hepatocytes in both obese and lean , but elicits exacerbated liver fibrosis in lean  likely by affecting other cell types.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, lipotoxicity is crucial for the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). Autophagy is required for the clearance of protein aggregates or damaged mitochondria to maintain cellular metabolic homeostasis. The NFE2L2/NRF2 (nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2)-KEAP1 (kelch like ECH associated protein 1) pathway is essential for the elimination of ROS. ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; yeast Atg1) is involved in the initiation of autophagy; however, its role in lipotoxicity-induced cell death in hepatocytes and mouse liver has not been elucidated. We now show that ULK1 potentiates the interaction between KEAP1 and the autophagy adaptor protein SQSTM1/p62, thereby mediating NFE2L2 activation in a manner requiring SQSTM1-dependent autophagic KEAP1 degradation. Furthermore, ULK1 is required for the autophagic removal of damaged mitochondria and to enhance binding between SQSTM1 and PINK1 (PTEN induced kinase 1). This study demonstrates the molecular mechanisms underlying the cytoprotective role of ULK1 against lipotoxicity. Thus, ULK1 could represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of .

The deletion of group VIA calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPla2β) protects ob/ob mice from hepatic steatosis (BBAlip 1861, 2016, 440-461), however its role in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced  is still elusive. Here, wild-type and iPla2β-null mice were subjected to chronic feeding with HFD for 6 months. We showed that protection was observed in iPla2β-null mice with an attenuation of diet-induced body and liver-weight gains, liver enzymes, serum free fatty  as well as hepatic TG and steatosis scores. iPla2β deficiency under HFD attenuated the levels of 1-stearoyl lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), and lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) as well as elevation of hepatic arachidonate, arachidonate-containing cholesterol esters and prostaglandin E. More importantly, this deficiency rescued a defect in PL remodeling and attenuated the ratio of saturated and unsaturated PL. The protection by iPla2β deficiency was not observed during short-term HFD feeding of 3 or 5 weeks which showed no PL remodeling defect. In addition to PC/PE, this deficiency reversed the suppression of PC/PI and PE/PI among monounsaturated PL. However, this deficiency did not modulate hepatic PL contents and PL ratios in ER fractions, ER stress, fibrosis, and inflammation markers. Hence, iPla2β inactivation protected mice against hepatic steatosis and obesity during chronic dietary  by correcting PL remodeling defect and PI composition relative to PC and PE.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we assessed the effect of Silybin in a well-established in vitro coculture model of early-stage . LX2 and Huh7 cells were exposed to free fatty  (FFA) and Silybin as mono- or coculture (SCC). Cell viability, LX2 activation, collagen deposition, metalloproteinase 2 and 9 (MMP2-9) activity, and ROS generation were determined at 24, 96, and 144 h. Exposure to FFA induced the activation of LX2 as shown by the increase in cell viability and upregulation of collagen biosynthesis. Interestingly, while cotreatment with Silybin did not affect collagen production in LX2, a significant reduction was observed in SCC. MMP2-9 activity was reduced in FFA-treated Huh7 and SCC and cotreatment with Silybin induced a dose-dependent increase, while no effect was observed in LX2. Silybin also showed antioxidant properties by reducing the FFA-induced production of ROS in all the cell systems. Based on these data, Silybin exerts its beneficial effects by reducing LX2 proliferation and ROS generation.

Saroglitazar showed CYP2C8 inhibition in human liver microsomes (IC: 2.9 μM). The aim was to carry out drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies in Wistar rats using saroglitazar (perpetrator drug) with five CYP2C8 substrates. Also, the in vitro CYP2C8 inhibitory potential of saroglitazar in rat liver microsomes (RLM) was evaluated to justify use of preclinical model. The oral pharmacokinetics of various CYP2C8 substrates; montelukast, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, repaglinide and intravenous pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel was assessed in the presence/absence of oral saroglitazar (4 mg/kg) in Wistar rats. A separate study was performed to assess the oral pharmacokinetics of saroglitazar. Serial blood samples were collected from all studies and the harvested plasma were stored frozen until bioanalysis. LC-MS/MS was used for the analysis of various analytes; concentration data was subjected to noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis. Statistical tests (unpaired t-test) were employed to judge the level of DDI. Generally, the pharmacokinetics of CYP2C8 substrates was not affected by the concomitant intake of saroglitazar as judged by the overall exposure (AUC and AUC) and elimination half-life. The CYP2C8 IC of 4.5 μM in RLM for saroglitazar, supported the use of rats for this DDI study. In conclusion, pharmacokinetic data of diverse CYP2C8 substrates suggested that coadministration of saroglitazar did not cause clinically relevant DDI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Among them, 70 patients underwent liver biopsy after an overnight fast, and 90 patients were biopsied 5 h after an oral glucose tolerance test. Expression differences in genes encoding several fatty  metabolism-related factors were examined and correlated with hepatic histological changes based on NAFLD activity scores. Prospective patient follow-up continued until June 2018.The level of fatty  transport protein 5 (FATP5), which is associated with free fatty  intake, was significantly and inversely correlated with features of histological progression, including ballooning and fibrosis. This was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. Transcript levels of genes encoding fatty  metabolism-related proteins were comparable between  with severe fibrosis and cryptogenic cirrhosis. Furthermore, a prospective cohort study demonstrated that low FATP5 expression was the most significant risk factor for hepatic fat loss.Decreased hepatic FATP5 expression in NAFLD is linked to histological progression, and may be associated with hepatic fat loss during  progression to cirrhosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31152610>Regulated, sequential processing by multiple proteases is required for proper maturation and release of Bordetella filamentous hemagglutinin.</a></h2><p>Filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) is a critically important virulence factor produced by Bordetella species that cause respiratory infections in humans and other animals. It is also a prototypical member of the widespread two partner secretion (TPS) pathway family of proteins. First synthesized as a ~370 kDa protein called FhaB, its C-terminal ~1,200 amino  'prodomain' is removed during translocation to the cell surface via the outer membrane channel FhaC. Here, we identify CtpA as a periplasmic protease that is responsible for the regulated degradation of the prodomain and for creation of an intermediate polypeptide that is cleaved by the autotransporter protease SphB1 to generate FHA. We show that the central prodomain region is required to initiate degradation of the prodomain and that CtpA degrades the prodomain after a third, unidentified protease (P3) first removes the extreme C-terminus of the prodomain. Stepwise proteolysis by P3, CtpA and SphB1 is required for maturation of FhaB, release of FHA into the extracellular milieu, and full function in vivo. These data support a substantially updated model for the mechanism of secretion, maturation and function of this model TPS protein.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30972903>Accuracy of imaging methods for steatohepatitis diagnosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients: A systematic review.</a></h2><p>Non-invasive tests to diagnose non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () are urgently needed. This systematic review aims to evaluate imaging accuracy in diagnosing  among non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients, using liver biopsy as reference.Eligible studies were systematic reviews and cross-sectional/cohort studies of NAFLD patients comparing imaging with histology, considering accuracy and/or associations. MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to April 2018. Studies were screened on title/abstract, then assessed for eligibility on full-text. Data were extracted using a predesigned form. Risk of bias was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool.Of the 641 studies screened, 61 were included in scoping review, 30 of which (with accuracy results) in data synthesis. Imaging techniques included: elastography (transient elastography-TE, acoustic radiation force impulse-ARFI, magnetic resonance elastography-MRE), ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance (MR), computed tomography and scintigraphy. Histological  definition was heterogeneous. In 28/30 studies, no prespecified threshold was used (high risk of bias). AUROCs were up to 0.82 for TE, 0.90 for ARFI, 0.93 for MRE and 0.82 for US scores. MR techniques with higher accuracy were spectroscopy (AUROC = 1 for alanine), susceptibility-weighted imaging (AUROC = 0.91), multiparametric MR (AUROC = 0.80), optical analysis (AUROC = 0.83), gadoxetic -enhanced MR (AUROCs = 0.85) and superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced MR (AUROC = 0.87).

There is a close relationship between insulin resistance (IR) and NAFLD, with prevalence of NAFLD being 5-fold higher in patients with diabetes compared to those without. IR is implicated both in pathogenesis of NAFLD and in disease progression from steatosis to . Thus, modulation of IR represents a potential strategy for NAFLD treatment. This review highlights key proposed mechanisms linking IR and NAFLD, such as changes in rates of adipose tissue lipolysis and de novo lipogenesis, impaired mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation (FAO), changes in fat distribution, alterations in the gut microbiome, and alterations in levels of adipokines and cytokines. Furthermore, this review will discuss the main pharmacological strategies used to treat IR in patients with NAFLD and their efficacy based on recently published experimental and clinical data. These include biguanides, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1) agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-γ/α/δ) agonists, sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonists, with further novel treatments on the horizon.

Induction of pro-inflammatory mediators in hepatocytes exposed to free fatty  represents a hallmark event during  pathogenesis. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a prototypical pro-inflammatory mediator. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which megakaryocytic leukemia 1 (MKL1) mediates palmitate (PA) induced CRP transcription in hepatocytes. We report that over-expression of MKL1, but not MKL2, activated the CRP promoter whereas depletion or inhibition of MKL1 repressed the CRP promoter. MKL1 potentiated the induction of the CRP promoter activity by PA treatment. Importantly, MKL1 knockdown by siRNA or pharmaceutical inhibition by CCG-1423 attenuated the induction of endogenous CRP expression in hepatocytes. Similarly, primary hepatocytes isolated from wild type (WT) mice produced more CRP than those isolated from MKL1 deficient (KO) mice when stimulated with PA. Mechanistically, the sequence-specific transcription factor CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPβ) interacted with MKL1 and recruited MKL1 to activate CRP transcription. Reciprocally, MKL1 modulated C/EBPβ activity by recruiting the chromatin remodeling protein BRG1 to the CRP promoter to alter histone modifications.

As a hydrophobic molecule located mainly in membranes it contributes together with other lipids to the physical and structural characteristics such as membrane stability, curvature, fluidity, and the organization into microdomains (lipid rafts). By acting as the main lipid-soluble antioxidant, it protects other lipids such as mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty  (MUFA and PUFA, respectively) against chemical reactions with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS, respectively) and prevents membrane destabilization and cellular dysfunction. In cells, vitamin E affects signaling in redox-dependent and redox-independent molecular mechanisms by influencing the activity of enzymes and receptors involved in modulating specific signal transduction and gene expression pathways. By protecting and preventing depletion of MUFA and PUFA it indirectly enables regulatory effects that are mediated by the numerous lipid mediators derived from these lipids. In recent years, some vitamin E metabolites have been observed to affect signal transduction and gene expression and their relevance for the regulatory function of vitamin E is beginning to be elucidated. In particular, the modulation of the CD36/FAT scavenger receptor/fatty  transporter by vitamin E may influence many cellular signaling pathways relevant for lipid homeostasis, inflammation, survival/apoptosis, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis, neurodegeneration, and senescence. Thus, vitamin E has an important role in modulating signal transduction and gene expression pathways relevant for its uptake, distribution, metabolism, and molecular action that when impaired affect physiological and patho-physiological cellular functions relevant for the prevention of a number of diseases.© 2018 IUBMB Life, 71(4):456-478, 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31260793>REGENERATE: Design of a pivotal, randomised, phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of obeticholic  in patients with fibrosis due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () is a chronic, progressive, and severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

A major current research effort is ongoing to find potential strategies to treat NAFLD-non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), with special attention to the gut microbiota. Multiple animal studies and pilot clinical trials are assessing different gut microbiota modulating strategies such as faecal microbiota transplantation, antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics.To review the role of microbiota in NAFLD- and determine whether pro- and prebiotics have potential as treatment METHODS: Information was obtained from critically reviewing literature on PubMed on targeting the gut microbiota in NAFLD. Search terms included NAFLD, , non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, steatohepatitis; combined with microbiome, microbiota, gut bacteria, probiotics and prebiotics.Animal studies and the first emerging studies in humans show promising results for both the common probiotics Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Streptococci as for short chain fatty  (SCFA) butyrate-producing bacteria. Also, prebiotics have positive effects on different mechanisms underlying NAFLD-.The most promising strategies thus far developed to alter the microbiome in NAFLD- are probiotics and prebiotics. However, pre- and probiotic treatment of NAFLD- is relatively new and still under development.

In this work, we provide compelling evidence that the pH dependent shift in the Hupd peak on Pt surfaces is driven by the structure of interfacial water rather than the specific adsorption of cations on the electrode surface. Combined cyclic voltammetric and surface enhanced spectroscopic investigations using an organic cation and crown-ether chelated alkali metal cations show that specific adsorption of metal and organic cations on the Pt surface at the conditions relevant to the HOR/HER is unlikely. The vibrational band corresponding to strongly bound water is monitored when the electrode potential is varied in the Hupd range in both  and base. By varying the electrode potential on the absolute and the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale simultaneously and only on the RHE scale while maintaining the absolute potential, we deconvolute the impact of two mechanisms through which the interfacial water structure is impacted: 1) hydrogen bonding with the adsorbed Hupd, and 2) electronic interaction with the electrode surface at different absolute potentials. While the hydrogen bonding between Hupd and interfacial water is identified as the primary mode of interaction, the direct water-electrode interaction, which depends on the absolute electrode potential, likely hold the key to understanding the pH induced Hupd peak shift on the Pt surface. Thus, engineering the interfacial water structure could be a fruitful direction in the design of HOR/HER catalysts operating in alkaline media.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In the present study, the role of AA on cell stress in tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)‑treated HepG2 cells was investigated. Our findings revealed that exposure to AA effectively ameliorated TNFα‑induced cell stresses, including hypoxia, inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by reducing the expression of Hif1α and its target genes (glucose transporter 1), pro‑inflammatory genes (monocyte chemoattractant 1) and ER stress‑related genes (glucose‑regulated protein, 78 kDa). AA also decreased the protein level of HIF1α. Additionally, AA significantly increased the secretion of total adiponectin and high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin. Mechanistically, AA was determined to increase the expression of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and its receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). Knockdown of FGFR2 not only decreased the levels of total adiponectin and HMW adiponectin, but almost abolished the beneficial effects of AA in ameliorating cell stress.

Likewise, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a known risk factor for the development of HCC, has emerged as the most common liver disease in Western countries. The underlying pathogenesis of NAFLD-related HCC remains unclear. The steatohepatitic variant of HCC (SH-HCC) typically presents in patients with metabolic risk factors and either cirrhotic or non-cirrhotic NAFLD and shares many of the histological features found in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (). Given their similar morphological features, distinguishing SH-HCC from background fatty liver can be a diagnostic challenge. Immunohistochemical studies to characterize and assist in the diagnosis are relatively limited. Whether the steatotic phenotype of SH-HCC results from the tumor's adaptive response to an environment rich in fatty  or from an independent pathogenic pathway remains to be seen.

We also characterised NAFLD-driven functional adaptations of macrophages in vitro and their functional relevance during steatohepatitis in vivo.Single-cell RNA sequencing identified distinct myeloid cell clusters in the liver and bone marrow. In both compartments, monocyte-derived populations were largely expanded in -affected mice. Importantly, the liver myeloid compartment adapted a unique inflammatory phenotype during NAFLD progression, exemplarily characterised by downregulated inflammatory calprotectin (S100A8/A9) in macrophage and dendritic cell subsets. This distinctive gene signature was also found in their bone marrow precursors. The  myeloid phenotype was principally recapitulated by in vitro exposure of bone marrow-derived macrophages with fatty , depended on toll-like receptor 4 signalling and defined a characteristic response pattern to lipopolysaccharide stimulation.

Fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome, one of the chronic liver diseases in laying hens, has great similarity to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in humans. It is characterized by the pathological accumulation of liver fat. Non-invasive techniques are needed for early identification of fibrosis. As primary de novo lipogenesis in the liver of chicken is similar to that of humans, mature chicken is an ideal animal model for the understanding of NAFLD. This study was aimed to evaluate the relationships between gut microbiota and natural chronic liver disease (i.e., non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [] and fibrosis stages) in a well-characterized laying hen population. One hundred 20-wk-old Hy-Line Brown laying hens were used and fed with basal diets until 52 wk of age. At the end of the experiment, birds were killed for sampling blood, liver, and cecal contents, and then classified by liver histology measurement into different groups. We investigated microbial community structure of cecum using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Subjects in stage 0 fibrosis without  were classified as low NAFLD (Group A), subjects in stage 1-2 fibrosis with mild to moderate  were defined as low  (Group B), and subjects in stage 3 fibrosis were defined as severe  (Group C). The abundance of Firmicutes was reduced in Groups B and C (P < 0.001), whereas opposite results were observed for the abundance of Bacteroidetes. Additionally, the families Bacteroidaceae, Ruminococcaceae Lachnospiraceae, and lactobacillae were significantly different between groups of differing fibrosis stages (P < 0.001), driven entirely by alterations of Bacteroides and lactobacillus and lachnospiraceae genera (P < 0.001), were observed. Results indicated that cecal dysbiosis was linked with the severity of fibrosis and ; importantly, increased levels of serum AST, alkaline phosphatase, and uric  were accompanied with liver fibrosis and  severity.

Results showed that oral administration of polydatin protected against hepatic lipid accumulation and alleviated inflammation and hepatocyte damage in db/db mice fed methionine-choline deficient diet. Polydatin also alleviated palmitic -induced lipid accumulation in cultured hepatocytes. In both models, polydatin restored lysosomal function and autophagic flux that were impaired by  or steatosis. Mechanistically, polydatin inhibited mTOR signalling and up-regulated the expression and activity of TFEB, a known master regulator of lysosomal function. In conclusion, polydatin ameliorated  through restoring autophagic flux.

Herein, we examined the therapeutic effect of increased n-3 PUFA tissue levels in fat-1 transgenic mice on progressive .Disease was induced in mice by streptozotocin and high fat diet (STZ/HFD) resulting in . NAFLD in 6 and 8 weeks old wild type and fat-1 transgenic STZ/HFD treated mice was analyzed. Unlike all other mammals, fat-1 transgenic mice ubiquitously express an n-3 fatty  desaturase, which converts n-6 to n-3 PUFAs, leading to increased n-3 and decreased n-6 PUFA tissue contents.Liver damage, NAFLD activity score (NAS), hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation were significantly reduced in fat-1 transgenic STZ/HFD treated mice in the early (6 weeks) but not late (8 weeks) phase of . Simultaneously, mRNA expression of genes involved in fatty  uptake and storage ( and , respectively) was significantly down-regulated in 6 week old but not 8 week old fat-1 transgenic STZ/HFD treated mice.Endogenously elevated n-3 PUFA levels in fat-1 transgenic mice transiently delay the onset of STZ/HFD induced  but failed to efficiently protect from  development.2019 Hepatobiliary Surgery and Nutrition.

Bile  such as ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) play an essential role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD by regulating the level of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 1c, but the underlying regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Increased evidence indicates that the AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway is a key pathway to regulate hepatic cellular lipid metabolism. UDCA may regulate the AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway to ameliorate hepatic lipid metabolism.To investigate the functional mechanism of UDCA in an oleic  (OA)-induced cellular model of NAFLD.The cellular model of NAFLD was established using OA and treated with UDCA. First, the best concentration of UDCA was selected. For the best time-dependent assay, cells were stimulated with OA only or co-treated with OA and 2 mmol/L UDCA for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Oil red O staining was used to observe the accumulation of intracellular lipids, while the intracellular contents of triglyceride, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were detected by enzymatic methods. Meanwhile, the expression levels of AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway-related proteins were detected by real-time PCR and Western blot.In the NAFLD cell model established with LO2 cells induced using OA, lipid accumulation was obvious. UDCA significantly inhibited lipid accumulation at different concentrations (especially 2 mmol/L) and decreased cell growth ability at different time points. The biochemical parameters like ALT, AST, and GGT were significant improved by UDCA. UDCA treatment vividly repressed the activation of AKT, mTOR, and CRTC2 and the expression of nSREBP-1 in LO2 cells induced with OA.Our findings demonstrate the effect of UDCA in improving NAFLD. UDCA attenuates OA-induced hepatic steatosis mainly by regulation of AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signal transduction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639005>Therapeutic effect and autophagy regulation of myriocin in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Ceramide plays pathogenic roles in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) via multiple mechanisms, and as such inhibition of ceramide de novo synthesis in the liver may be of therapeutically beneficial in patients with NAFLD. In this study, we aimed to explore whether inhibition of ceramide signaling by myriocin is beneficial in animal model of NAFLD via regulating autophagy.Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: standard chow (n = 10), high-fat diet (HFD) (n = 10) or HFD combined with oral administration of myriocin (0.3 mg/kg on alternate days for 8 weeks) (n = 10). Liver histology and autophagy function were measured. HepG2 cells were incubated with fatty  with or without myriocin treatment. Lipid accumulation and autophagy markers in the HepG2 cells were analyzed. Serum ceramide changes were studied in 104 subjects consisting healthy adults, liver biopsy-proven patients with NAFLD and liver biopsy-proven patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Myriocin reversed the elevated body weight and serum transaminases and alleviated dyslipidemia in HFD fed rats. Myriocin treatment significantly attenuated liver pathology including steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning. By qPCR analysis, it was revealed that myriocin corrected the expression pattern of fatty  metabolism associated genes including Fabp1, Pparα, Cpt-1α and Acox-2. Further, myriocin also restored the impaired hepatic autophagy function in rats with HFD-induced , and this has been verified in HepG2 cells. Among the sphingolipid species that we screened in lipidomic profiles, significantly increased ceramide was observed in  patients as compared to the controls and non- patients, regardless of whether or not they have active CHB.Ceramide may play an important regulatory role in the autophagy function in the pathogenesis of . Hence, blockade of ceramide signaling by myriocin may be of therapeutically beneficial in .Registration ID: ChiCTR-DDT-13003983 .

Lack of non-invasive diagnostic tools and effective therapies constitute two of the major hurdles for a bona fide treatment and a reversal of  progression and/or regression of the disease. Nitro-oleic  (OA-NO) has been proven effective in multiple experimental models of inflammation and fibrosis. Thus, the potential benefit of in vivo administration of OA-NO to treat advanced NAFLD was tested herein in a model of long-term  diet-induced liver damage.Non-invasive imaging (e.g. photoacustic-ultrasound (PA-US)) was pursued to establish advanced experimental model of  in mice in which both steatosis and fibrosis were diagnosed prior experimental therapy with OA-NO. Experimental controls included equimolar amounts of the non-nitrated oleic  (OA). CLAMS and NMR-based analysis was used for energy metabolism.CLAMS and NMR-based analysis demonstrates that OA-NO improves body composition and energy metabolism and inhibits hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation. Photoacoustic-ultrasound imaging revealed a robust inhibition of liver steatosis and fibrosis by OA-NO. RNA-sequencing analysis uncovered inflammation and fibrosis as major pathways suppressed by OA-NO administration, as well as regulation of lipogenesis and lipolysis pathways, with a robust inhibition of SREBP1 proteolytic activation and subsequent lipogenesis gene expression by OA-NO. These results were further supported by histological analysis and quantification of lipid accumulation, lobular inflammation (F4/80 staining) and fibrosis (collagen deposition, αSMA staining) as well as established parameters of liver damage (ALT). In vitro studies indicate that OA-NO inhibits TG biosynthesis and accumulation in hepatocytes and inhibits fibrogenesis in human stellate cells.OA-NO improve steatohepatitis and fibrosis and may constitute an effective therapeutic approach against advanced NAFLD that warrants further clinical evaluation.Copyright © 2019.

This study investigated the in vivo potential of NDGA for prevention or attenuation of the pathophysiologic abnormalities of . A novel dietary  model with feeding C57BL/6J mice with a high trans-fat, high cholesterol and high fructose (HTF) diet, was used. The HTF diet fed mice exhibited obesity, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, inflammation, ER stress, oxidative stress, and liver injury. NDGA attenuated these metabolic abnormalities as well as hepatic steatosis and fibrosis together with attenuated expression of genes encoding fibrosis, progenitor and macrophage markers with no effect on the levels of mRNAs for lipogenic enzymes. NDGA increased expression of fatty  oxidation genes. In conclusion, NDGA exerts anti-/anti-fibrotic actions and raises the therapeutic potential of NDGA for treatment of  patients with fibrosis and other associated complications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The expression profiles of messenger ribonucleic  (mRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) were examined using microarray and verified by RT-qPCR.QG significantly improved the phenotypic characteristics of , as serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and liver inflammatory cytokines were significantly decreased. By the cutoff of a 1.5-fold change and P < 0.05, 6193 mRNAs, 5692 lncRNAs and 4843 circRNAs were identified as differentially expressed between the MCD and normal groups, and 514 mRNAs, 1182 lncRNAs and 443 circRNAs were identified as differentially expressed between the QG and MCD groups. The intersections (244 mRNAs, 259 lncRNAs and 98 circRNAs) among the three groups were chosen for analysis.

Control diet RL showed higher MMP-9 activity compared with ML and LL. No significant lobar differences in MMP-2 activity were detected in the NAFLD model. MMP-9 activity was not detectable in Zucker rats. TIMP-1 was lower in LL when compared with ML while no lobar differences were detectable for TIMP-2 in either Obese or Lean Zucker rats.

A key aspect of NAFLD pathogenesis is proinflammatory hepatic macrophage activation and hepatic recruitment of circulating monocytes, which originate from the bone marrow. In neonates, the activation and polarization of myeloid immune cells are normally shaped in part by systemic factors derived from intestinal microbiota during the first 1000 days of life. Perturbations of the gut microbiome, and in turn the metabolites and bacterial products released systemically, can affect the functional phenotype of these immune cells. Evidence in germ-free mice has shown that fecal microbial transfer from obese mice or obese human donors promotes obesity and inflammation in the recipients, suggesting a direct role for the gut microbiome in promoting obesity and possibly NAFLD. Indeed, patients suffering from NAFLD show evidence for dysbiosis, increased gut permeability, and changes in bile  that drive the progression of hepatic inflammation toward non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), the more severe form of the disease. Compared with infants born to normal-weight mothers, we previously showed that the gut microbiome from neonates born to obese mothers is compositionally distinct.

The development of novel therapies has been hindered in part, by the limitations of existing preclinical models. There is a strong need for physiologically relevant  and  liver fibrosis models that are characterized by better translational predictability. In this study, we used the InSphero 3D InSight three-dimensional (3D) human liver microtissue (3D-hLMT) system prepared by co-culturing primary human hepatocytes with hepatic stellate cells, Kupffer cells and endothelial cells to develop a model of  with a severe fibrotic phenotype. In our model, palmitic  (PA) induced a robust proinflammatory and profibrogenic phenotype in the 3D-hLMT. PA significantly increased several markers of the inflammatory and profibrotic process including gene expression of collagens, , tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloprotease 1 () and the stellate cell activation marker  as well as secreted CXCL8 (IL8) levels. We also observed TGFβ pathway activation, increase in active collagen synthesis and significant overall increase in tissue damage in the 3D-hLMTs. Immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated the upregulation of collagen, cleaved caspase 3 as well as of the PDGFRβ protein. We further validated the model using a phase 3 clinical compound, GS-4997, an apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK-1) inhibitor and showed that GS-4997 significantly decreased PA induced profibrotic and proinflammatory response in the 3D-hLMTs with decreases in apoptosis and stellate cell activation in the microtissues. Taken together we have established and validated an  3D-hLMT  model with severe fibrotic phenotype that can be a powerful tool to investigate experimental compounds for the treatment of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31497874>Delayed intervention with a novel SGLT2 inhibitor NGI001 suppresses diet-induced metabolic dysfunction and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), is closely related to metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Despite an accumulating number of studies, no pharmacotherapy that targets NAFLD has received general approval for clinical use.Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition is a promising approach to treat diabetes, obesity, and associated metabolic disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of a novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, on NAFLD and obesity-associated metabolic symptoms in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice.Delayed intervention with NGI001 protected against body weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia, compared with HFD alone. Adipocyte hypertrophy was prevented by administering NGI001. NGI001 inhibited impaired glucose metabolism and regulated the secretion of adipokines associated with insulin resistance. In addition, NGI001 supplementation suppressed hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation, and had little impact on kidney function. In-depth investigations showed NGI001 ameliorated fat deposition and increased AMPK phosphorylation, resulting in phosphorylation of its major downstream target, ACC, in human hepatocytes, HuS-E/2 cells. This cascade ultimately led to the downregulation of downstream fatty  synthesis-related molecules and the upregulation of downstream β oxidation-associated molecules. Surprisingly, NGI001 decreased gene and protein expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 and glucose uptake in oleic -treated HuS-E/2 cells.Our findings suggest the therapeutic potential of the novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, to attenuate or delay the onset of diet-induced metabolic diseases and NAFLD.This article is protected by copyright.

Such coagonists also regulate lipid metabolism, independent of their body weight lowering effects. Many actions of the coagonists are partly mediated by fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) signaling, with the major exception of bile homeostasis. Since thyroid hormone is an important regulator of bile homeostasis, we studied the involvement of thyroid hormone in coagonist-induced changes in lipid and bile metabolism.We evaluated the effect of a single dose of coagonist Aib2 C24 chimera2 at 150 to 10000 µg/kg on tetraiodothyronine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in high-fat diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and chow-fed mice. Repeated dose treatment of coagonist (150 µg/kg, subcutaneously) was assessed in four mice models namely, on lipid and bile homeostasis in DIO mice, propylthiouracil (PTU)-treated DIO mice, methimazole (MTM)-treated DIO mice and choline-deficient, L-amino -defined, highfat diet (CDAHFD)-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ().Single dose treatment of coagonist did not alter serum T3 and T4 in chow-fed mice and DIO mice. Coagonist treatment improved lipid metabolism and biliary cholesterol excretion. Chronic treatment of GLP-1 and glucagon coagonist did not alter serum T3 in hypothyroid DIO mice and CDAHFDinduced . Coagonist increased serum T4 in DIO mice after 4 and 40 weeks of treatment, though no change in T4 levels was observed in hypothyroid mice or mice with .Our data demonstrate that coagonist of GLP-1 and glucagon receptors does not modulate bile homeostasis via thyroid signaling.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31392821>Lysosomal  lipase activity and liver fibrosis in the clinical continuum of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Recent evidence showed a reduced activity of the lysosomal  lipase (LAL) in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cryptogenic cirrhosis (CC).

This study investigated the hepatoprotective effect of mevalonic  pathway inhibition by Zoledronic  (ZA) on the hepatic changes associated with high fat diet (HFD) in rats.Thirty two male Wistar rats were used. They were divided into 2 groups: (I) control naïve (II) : induced by HFD for 12 weeks, this group is subdivided into (A)  untreated (B) + ZA (50ug/kg/week) i.p. for 12 weeks (C)  + ZA (100μg/kg/week) i.p. for 12 weeks. Portal pressure (PP), liver enzymes AST and ALT, serum glucose, lipid profile, hepatic levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), FC and triglyceride (TG), histopathological changes and expression of both hepatic alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and Caspase-3 were measured. ZA significantly prevented portal hypertension, worsening in liver function, and dyslipidemia. The hepatic levels of TNF-α, VEGF, FC and TG were significantly decreased in comparison to  untreated group. ZA hindered the histopathological changes induced by HFD. ZA inhibited the expression of hepatic α-SMA and Caspase-3 with significant difference favor the high dose intervention. ZA in a dose related manner prevents the hepatic pathological effects of chronic HFD ingestion in rats. This may be largely mediated by its ability to reduce TNF-α and hepatic FC.Copyright © 2019.

Progression of healthy liver to steatosis and  is not yet fully understood in terms of process and response. Hepatic oxidative stress is believed to be one of the factors driving steatosis to . Oxidative protein modification is the major cause of protein functional impairment in which alteration of key hepatic enzymes is likely to be a crucial factor for NAFLD biology. In the present study, we aimed to discover carbonylated protein profiles involving in NAFLD biology in vitro.Hepatocyte cell line was used to induce steatosis with fatty  (FA) in the presence and absence of menadione (oxidative stress inducer). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-based proteomics and dinitrophenyl hydrazine derivatization technique were used to identify carbonylated proteins. Sequentially, in order to view changes in protein carbonylation pathway, enrichment using Funrich algorithm was performed. The selected carbonylated proteins were validated with western blot and carbonylated sites were further identified by high-resolution LC-MS/MS.Proteomic results and pathway analysis revealed that carbonylated proteins are involved in  pathogenesis pathways in which most of them play important roles in energy metabolisms. Particularly, carbonylation level of ATP synthase subunit α (ATP5A), a key protein in cellular respiration, was reduced after FA and FA with oxidative stress treatment, whereas its expression was not altered. Carbonylated sites on this protein were identified and it was revealed that these sites are located in nucleotide binding region. Modification of these sites may, therefore, disturb ATP5A activity. As a consequence, the lower carbonylation level on ATP5A after FA treatment solely or with oxidative stress can increase ATP production.The reduction in carbonylated level of ATP5A might occur to generate more energy in response to pathological conditions, in our case, fat accumulation and oxidative stress in hepatocytes. This would imply the association between protein carbonylation and molecular response to development of steatosis and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31113613>Lysosomal  Lipase: Can it be a New Non-Invasive Serum Biomarker of Cryptogenic Liver Fibrosis and Cirrhosis?</a></h2><p>The association between lysosomal  lipase (LAL) activity and liver steatosis or fibrosis is poorly studied. The aim of our study was to determine the predictive power of LAL for cryptogenic liver steatosis and cryptogenic significant fibrosis/cirrhosis.Cross-sectional observational study of 101 adult patients with unexplained elevated liver enzymes/hepatomegaly with or without dyslipidemia submitted to the determination of LAL activity and LIPA gene (E8SJM-C.894G^A) mutation. Seventy-one patients underwent liver biopsy or FibroScan®. Patients with an identifiable liver dysfunction cause and well-stablished NAFLD/ risk factors were excluded. Predictors for liver steatosis, significant fibrosis (> F2) or cirrhosis (F4) were evaluated.Liver steatosis and fibrosis were mainly assessed by liver biopsy (74.6%; n = 53). Steatosis was present in 62.0% (n = 44), significant fibrosis in 47.9% (n = 34) and cirrhosis in 39.4% (n = 28). The median LAL was 0.36 (0.21-0.46)nmol/spot/h (vs. 0.29 (0.20-0.47); p = 0.558) for liver steatosis, 0.22 (0.11-0.29) nmol/spot/h (vs. 0.40 (0.34-0.51); p <0.001) for significant fibrosis and 0.21 (0.11-0.27) nmol/spot/h (vs. 0.40 (0.32-0.52); p < 0.001) for cirrhosis. No LIPA gene mutations were found. LAL activity was the strongest predictor of significant fibrosis (AUROC: 0.833; p < 0.001) with a cut-off of 0.265 (sensitivity: 85.9%; specificity: 75.0%) and cirrhosis (AUROC: 0.859; p < 0.001) with a cut-off of 0.235 (sensitivity: 86.2%; specificity: 75.0%), being higher than FIB4, GUCI or APRI. However, LAL activity was not associated with liver steatosis (AUROC: 0.536; p =0.558).LAL activity can be considered a non-invasive new marker of cryptogenic liver fibrosis with higher accuracy than other known biomarkers. LAL activity < 0.265 nmol/spot/h was strongly associated with cryptogenic significant fibrosis and <0.235 nmol/spot/h with cryptogenic cirrhosis.

We previously reported that protein kinase R (PKR) in hepatocytes regulated HCC proliferation. In this study, we focused on the role of PKR in HSCs, and clarified the mechanism of its association with HCC progression. We confirmed the activation of PKR in a human HSC cell line (LX-2 cell). IL-1β is produced from HSCs stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or palmitic  which are likely activators of PKR in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (). Production was assessed by real-time PCR and ELISA. C16 and small interfering RNA (siRNA) were used to inhibit PKR in HSCs. The HCC cell line (HepG2 cell) was cultured with HSC conditioning medium to assess HCC progression, which was evaluated by proliferation and scratch assays. Expression of PKR was increased and activated in stimulated HSCs, and IL-1β production was also increased molecular. Key molecules of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway were also upregulated and activated by LPS. Otherwise, PKR inhibition by C16 and PKR siRNA decreased IL-1β production. HCC progression was promoted by HSC-stimulated conditioning medium although it was reduced by the conditioning medium from PKR-inhibited HSCs. Moreover, palmitic  also upregulated IL-1β expression in HSCs, and conditioning medium from palmitic -stimulated HSCs promoted HCC proliferation. Stimulated HSCs by activators of PKR in  could play a role in promoting HCC progression through the production of IL-1β, via a mechanism that seems to be dependent on PKR activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630534>Comparison of murine steatohepatitis models identifies a dietary intervention with robust fibrosis, ductular reaction and rapid progression to cirrhosis, cancer.</a></h2><p>Progressive fibrosis, liver failure and cancer are central liver-related outcomes of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), but notoriously difficult to achieve in mouse models. We performed a direct, quantitative comparison of hepatic fibrosis progression in well-defined methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) and choline-deficient, amino- defined (CDAA) diets with increasing fat content (10-60% by calories) in C57Bl/6J and BALB/cAnNCrl mice.In C57Bl/6J mice, MCD feeding resulted in moderate fibrosis at week 8 (2-fold increase in hepatic collagen content) and progressive weight loss, irrespective of fat content. In contrast, CDAA-fed mice did not lose weight and developed progressive fibrosis starting from week 4. High dietary fat in the CDAA diet model dose-dependently induced the lipid metabolism genes SREBP and SCD2, and increased the ductular reaction and fibrosis. Longitudinal analysis of CDAA with 60% fat (HF-CDAA) feeding revealed pronounced ductular reaction and perisinusoidal bridging fibrosis, with a 7-fold increase of hepatic collagen at week 12, that showed limited spontaneous reversibility. At 24 weeks, HF-CDAA mice developed signs of cirrhosis with 10-fold HYP increase, regenerative nodules, portal hypertension and elevated serum bilirubin and ammonia; 80% of mice (8/10) developed multiple hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). High fat supplementation of MCD in C57Bl/6J, or feeding HF-CDAA diet to fibrosis-prone BALB/cAnNCrl strain failed to result in increased fibrosis.In conclusion, HF-CDAA feeding in C57Bl/6J mice was identified as an optimal model of steatohepatitis with robust fibrosis and ductular proliferations that progress to cirrhosis and HCC within 24 weeks.

Almost all patients with fibrosing  had free cholesterol staining by filipin (16/16) and cholesterol crystals (15/16) in hepatocyte LDs, mostly in association with the LD membrane, compared to only 3/14 with cholesterol crystals and 3/14 with faint filipin staining in patients with isolated steatosis ( < 0.05). We were unable to identify significant differences in the expression of genes in liver tissue related to cholesterol homeostasis or LD proteins between patients with fibrosing  and isolated steatosis. Human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) cells were supplemented with low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and oleic  to develop large LDs, similar to those observed in patients with . Fluorescent markers were used to track the uptake and intracellular trafficking of LDL-cholesterol. LDL-cholesterol was taken up by HepG2 cells and transported through the endosomal-lysosomal compartment directly to LDs, suggesting direct contact sites between late endosomes and LDs. Exposure of HepG2 cells to LDL-cholesterol resulted in a high concentration of cholesterol and cholesterol crystallization in LDs.  Excess cholesterol is stored in the liver primarily within hepatocyte LDs where it can crystallize.

In this study, we established a chronic Cd-exposure mouse model mimicking the liver Cd deposition in middle-aged human population to determine whether the environmental Cd exposure can induce NAFLD. Results showed that hepatic Cd burden at levels of 0.95 and 6.04 μg/g wet weight resulting from 20-week Cd exposure at different doses induced NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ()-like phenotypes in mice, respectively. The Cd exposure caused marked hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction and fatty  oxidation deficiency, along with significant suppression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) signaling pathway in the liver. In vitro study confirmed that Cd evidently inhibited mitochondrial fatty  oxidation in hepatocytes and that SIRT1 signaling was potentially involved in the process.

NAFLD can progress to an inflammatory state called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), which may result in the development of fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. To develop therapeutic strategies against NAFLD, a better understanding of the molecular mechanism is needed. Current in vitro NAFLD models fail to capture the essential interactions between liver cell types and often do not reflect the pathophysiological status of patients. To overcome limitations of commonly used in vitro and in vivo models, precision-cut liver slices (PCLSs) were used in this study. PCLSs, prepared from liver tissue obtained from male Wistar rats, were cultured in supraphysiological concentrations of glucose, fructose, insulin, and palmitic  to mimic metabolic syndrome. Accumulation of lipid droplets was visible and measurable after 24 h in PCLSs incubated with glucose, fructose, and insulin, both in the presence and absence of palmitic . Upregulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 and 2, and of sterol responsive element binding protein 1c, suggests increased de novo lipogenesis in PCLSs cultured under these conditions. Additionally, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 expression was reduced, which indicates impaired fatty  transport and disrupted mitochondrial β-oxidation. Thus, steatosis was successfully induced in PCLSs with modified culture medium. This novel ex vivo NAFLD model could be used to investigate the multicellular and molecular mechanisms that drive NAFLD development and progression, and to study potential anti-steatotic drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399619>Evaluation of AGP Fucosylation as a Marker for Hepatocellular Carcinoma of Three Different Etiologies.</a></h2><p>A mass spectrometric analysis platform has been developed to determine whether glycosylation patterns of alpha-1  glycoprotein (AGP) could be used as a marker for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in different etiologies, i.e. non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), alcoholic liver disease (ALC), and hepatitis C virus (HCV).

This is partially because drug development is decelerated due to the lack of adequate tools to assess the efficacy of potential new drug candidates. The present study describes the development and application of a new preclinical model for  using hepatic cells generated from human skin-derived precursors. Exposure of these cells to lipogenic (insulin, glucose, fatty ) and pro-inflammatory factors (IL-1β, TNF-α, TGF-β) resulted in a characteristic  response, as indicated by intracellular lipid accumulation, modulation of -specific gene expression, increased caspase-3/7 activity and the expression and/or secretion of inflammatory markers, including CCL2, CCL5, CCL7, CCL8, CXCL5, CXCL8, IL1a, IL6 and IL11. The human relevance of the proposed  model was verified by transcriptomics analyses that revealed commonly modulated genes and the identification of the same gene classes between the in vitro system and patients suffering from . The application potential of this in vitro model was demonstrated by testing elafibranor, a promising anti- compound currently under clinical phase III trial evaluation. Elafibranor attenuated in vitro key features of , and dramatically lowered lipid load as well as the expression and secretion of inflammatory chemokines, which in vivo are responsible for the recruitment of immune cells.

The mechanisms that associate dysbiosis with NAFLD include changes in microbiota-derived mediators, deregulation of the gut endothelial barrier, translocation of mediators of dysbiosis, and hepatic inflammation.

Hepatic AR is induced under hyperglycemia condition and converts excess glucose to lipogenic fructose, which contributes in part to the accumulation of fat in the liver cells of diabetes rodents. In addition, the hyperglycemia-induced AR or nutrition-induced AR causes suppression of the transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α and reduced lipolysis in the liver, which also contribute to the development of NAFLD. Moreover, AR induction in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () may aggravate oxidative stress and the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the liver. Here, we summarize the knowledge on AR inhibitors of plant origin and review the effect of some plant-derived AR inhibitors on NAFLD/ in rodents. Natural AR inhibitors may improve NAFLD at least in part through attenuating oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine expression. Some of the natural AR inhibitors have been reported to attenuate hepatic steatosis through the regulation of PPARα-mediated fatty  oxidation. In this review, we propose that the natural AR inhibitors are potential therapeutic agents for NAFLD.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30870804>Cancer-related gene expression is associated with disease severity and modifiable lifestyle factors in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to determine whether hepatic gene expression related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with disease severity and modifiable lifestyle factors in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).In a cross-sectional study, the associations between hepatic gene expression and liver histology, insulin resistance, anthropometrics, diet, and physical activity were assessed in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (; n = 19) or simple steatosis (SS; n = 20). In a group of patients with , we then conducted a 1-y, single-arm, pilot study using ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) supplementation to determine whether changes in hepatic PUFA content would have a modulating effect on hepatic gene expression and would affect liver histology.In the cross-sectional study, histological features of disease severity correlated with AKR1B10, ANXA2, PEG10, SPP1, STMN2, MT1A, and MT1B in  and with EEF1A2, PEG10, and SPP1 in SS. In addition, PEG10, SPP1, ANXA2, and STMN2 expression correlated positively with insulin resistance in . SPP1 and UBD correlated strongly with body mass index in SS. Associations between ENPP2, AKR1B10, SPP1, UBD, and waist circumference depended on sex and diagnosis. Several genes correlated with protein, fat, or carbohydrate intake. PEG10 correlated positively with physical activity in  and inversely with plasma vitamin C in both groups. Despite increased erythrocyte and hepatic ω-3 PUFA, supplementation did not alter hepatic gene expression and liver histology.HCC-related gene expression was associated with liver histology, body mass index, waist circumference, diet, and physical activity but was not affected by ω-3 PUFA supplementation.Copyright © 2018.

It was hypothesized that 3β-[F]FCA could also be used as a non-invasive tool to monitor (regional) liver function in vivo in different liver diseases through altered expression of bile  transporters.Hepatobiliary transport of 3β-[F]FCA was evaluated in four murine liver disease models. Acute liver injury was induced by oral gavage of an acetaminophen (APAP) overdose (300 mg/kg). Chronic cholangiopathy and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () were induced by feeding mice 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl- 1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet or methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet, respectively. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was evoked by intraperitoneal injection of 35 mg/kg diethylnitrosamine (DEN) once a week for 23 weeks. Gene expression of the murine bile  transporters was determined by RT-qPCR.Hepatobiliary transport of 3β-[F]FCA was not significantly altered after an APAP overdose. Mice fed the DDC or MCD diet showed impaired transport of 3β-[F]FCA compared to baseline, which was associated with altered expression of the bile  transporters ntcp, oatp4 and mrp2. After recovery from DDC- and MCD-induced liver injury, 3β-[F]FCA parameters returned to baseline. Global hepatobiliary transport of 3β-[F]FCA in HCC bearing mice was not significantly different compared to control mice. However, HCC lesions showed reduced hepatic uptake of the tracer (tumor-to-background: 0.45 ± 0.13), which was in line with decreased in expression of basolateral bile  uptake transporters nctp and oatp4 in tumor tissue.3β-[F]FCA is a useful tool to assess and longitudinally follow-up liver function in several mouse models for liver diseases that are associated with altered expression of the bile  transporters. These results point towards the (pre)clinical utility of 3β-[F]FCA as a PET tracer to monitor altered liver functionality in patients with chronic liver diseases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

NAFLD ranges in severity from benign steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are strongly associated with NAFLD, and the western diet (WD) is a major contributor to the onset and progression of these chronic diseases. Our aim was to use a lipidomic approach to identify potential lipid mediators of diet-induced .

This report used livers from the previous study to carry out ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with dynamic multi-reaction monitoring (HPLC-dMRM) to assess the impact of the WD and DHA on hepatic membrane lipid and oxylipin composition, respectively. Feeding mice the WD increased hepatic saturated and monounsaturated fatty  and arachidonic  (ARA, 20:4, ω6) in membrane lipids and suppressed ω3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) in membrane lipids and ω3 PUFA-derived anti-inflammatory oxylipins. Supplementing the WD with DHA lowered hepatic ARA in membrane lipids and ARA-derived oxylipins and significantly increased hepatic DHA and its metabolites in membrane lipids, as well as C ω3 PUFA-derived oxylipins.  markers of inflammation and fibrosis were inversely associated with hepatic C ω3 PUFA-derived Cyp2C- and Cyp2J-generated anti-inflammatory oxylipins (false discovery rate adjusted -value;  ≤ 0.026). Our findings suggest that dietary DHA promoted partial remission of WD-induced , at least in part, by lowering hepatic pro-inflammatory oxylipins derived from ARA and increasing hepatic anti-inflammatory oxylipins derived from C ω3 PUFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30732555>Mechanisms of beneficial effects of exercise training on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Roles of oxidative stress and inflammation.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common chronic liver disorder which is associated with accumulation of fats in the liver. It causes a wide variety of pathological effects such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and cirrhosis, insulin resistance, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The molecular mechanisms that cause the initiation and progression of NAFLD are not fully understood. Oxidative stress (OS) induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation are likely a significant mechanism which can lead to hepatic cell death and tissue injury. Mitochondrial abnormalities, down-regulation of several antioxidant enzymes, glutathione (GSH) depletion and decreased activity of GSH-dependent antioxidants, accumulation of leukocytes and hepatic inflammation are the major sources of ROS overproduction in NAFLD. Excessive production of ROS suppresses the capacity of other antioxidant defence systems in NAFLD and causes further oxidative damage. Regular exercise can be considered as an effective strategy for treatment of NAFLD. It improves NAFLD by reducing intrahepatic fat content, increasing β-oxidation of fatty , inducing hepato-protective autophagy, overexpressing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- γ (PPAR-γ), as well as attenuating hepatocyte apoptosis and increasing insulin sensitivity. Exercise training also suppresses ROS overproduction and OS in NAFLD via up-regulation of several antioxidant enzymes and anti-inflammatory mediators. Therefore, an understanding of these molecules and signalling pathways gives us valuable information about NAFLD progression and a method for developing a suitable clinical treatment. This review aimed to evaluate sources of ROS and OS in NAFLD and the molecular mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects of exercises on NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30601174>Omega-3 fatty  and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in adults and children: where do we stand?</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic fatty liver disease worldwide. The incidence of NAFLD parallels the prevalence of obesity. Moreover, NAFLD can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular cancer (HCC). As such, NAFLD has become a major public health concern. We discuss recent clinical trials and meta-analyses evaluating the efficacy of C20-22 ω3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) to attenuate preexisting NAFLD in adults and children.Humans with NAFLD and ; and preclinical mouse models of , have a high abundance of hepatic saturated (SFA) and monounsaturated (MUFA) fat, but a low abundance of hepatic C20-22 ω3 PUFA. This change in hepatic fat type and abundance is associated with hepatic lipotoxicity, inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis. Recent meta-analyses and clinical trials evaluated the capacity of C20-22 ω3 PUFA dietary supplementation to improve health outcomes in adults and children with preexisting NAFLD. Diets supplemented with docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22 : 6,ω3) alone or with eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, 20 : 5,ω3) are tolerated and effective at lowering liver fat in NAFLD patients. However, outcomes are mixed with respect to C20-22 ω3 PUFA attenuation of more severe NAFLD markers, such as hepatic injury, inflammation and fibrosis.These studies suggest that dietary supplementation with C20-22 ω3 PUFA should be considered as a viable and effective option to lower liver fat in obese adults and children with NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089474>Diabetes Mellitus, Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, and Conjugated Linoleic  (Omega 6): What Is the Link?</a></h2><p>Type 2 DM and obesity are the coming epidemics and their association with NAFLD is well established; essential fatty  are vital for body health yet the body cannot make them; 2 essential fatty  are especially important: linoleic (omega-6) and alpha-linoleic (omega-3) ; they can be considered as "bioactive lipids" and serve as functional foods.50 type 2 Egyptian diabetic patients controlled on oral hypoglycemic drugs together with 20 age- and sex-matched healthy participants were enrolled in the study; all were subjected to complete history taking, BMI, fasting plasma glucose, HOMA-IR, ALT, AST, GGT, urea and creatinine, total lipid profile, hepatitis markers including hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibodies, conjugated linoleic fatty  "CLA," and abdominal ultrasound for grading of NAFLD.Our study in Egyptian diabetics with NAFLD revealed a low level of serum CLA compared to healthy control; such deficiency was more marked with advanced grades of NAFLD; lowest levels were observed in those with severe steatosis () with definite association between CLA and obesity.Insulin resistance is the main link between NAFLD, diabetes, and obesity.

The FTH mice featured hepatic inflammation, severe diffuse fibrosis, and collagen deposition, which were less severe in FF & STH groups. In FTH group the protein expressions of α-SMA, TGF-ß, Col1 A1, CYP2E1, were up-regulated as compared to the FF group. The in-vivo findings were complemented in the LX-2 and Hep3B cells. The protein expressions of inflammatory and cellular injury markers were significantly higher in PA + TH exposed LX-2 cells.

The aim of this study was to assess expression of urea cycle-related genes to elucidate a possible gene regulatory basis to the functional problem.Liver mRNA expression analyses within the gene pathway governing hepatic nitrogen conversion were performed in 20 non-diabetic, biopsy-proven NAFLD patients (8 simple steatosis; 12 non-alcoholic steatohepatitis []) and 12 obese and 14 lean healthy individuals. Sixteen NAFLD patients were included for gene expression validation. Relationship between gene expressions and functional capacity for ureagenesis was described.Gene expression of most urea cycle-related enzymes were downregulated in NAFLD vs both control groups; markedly so for the urea cycle flux-generating carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS1) (~3.5-fold, P < .0001). In , CPS1 downregulation paralleled the deficit in ureagenesis (P = .03). Additionally, expression of several genes involved in amino  uptake and degradation, and the glucagon receptor gene, were downregulated in NAFLD. Conversely, glutamine synthetase (GS) expression increased >1.5-fold (P ≤ .03), inversely related to CPS1 expression (P = .004).NAFLD downregulated the expression of urea cycle-related genes. Downregulation of urea cycle flux-generating CPS1 correlated with the loss of functional capacity for ureagenesis in . On gene level, these changes coincided with an increase in the major ammonia scavenging enzyme GS. The effects seemed related to a fatty liver as such rather than  or obesity. The findings support gene regulatory mechanisms involved in the deficient ureagenesis of NAFLD, but it remains unexplained how hepatocyte fat accumulation exerts these effects.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, hepatic microenvironments that support the function of RORα as a polarity regulator were largely unknown. Here, we identified maresin 1 (MaR1), a docosahexaenoic  (DHA) metabolite with a function of specialized proresolving mediator, as an endogenous ligand of RORα. MaR1 enhanced the expression and transcriptional activity of RORα and thereby increased the M2 polarity of liver macrophages. Administration of MaR1 protected mice from high-fat diet-induced  in a RORα-dependent manner. Surprisingly, RORα increased the level of MaR1 through transcriptional induction of 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), a key enzyme in MaR1 biosynthesis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that modulation of 12-LOX activity enhanced the protective function of DHA against .

In the liver, parenchymal cells (i.e., mainly hepatocytes) utilize autophagy to provide amino , glucose, and free fatty  as sources of energy and biosynthesis functions, but also for recycling and controlling organelles such as mitochondria. Non-parenchymal cells of the liver, including endothelial cells, macrophages (Kupffer cells), and hepatic stellate cells (HSC), also employ autophagy, either for maintaining cellular homeostasis (macrophages, endothelium) or for providing energy for their activation (stellate cells). In hepatocytes, autophagy contributes to essential homeostatic functions (e.g., gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, fatty  oxidation), but is also implicated in diseases. For instance, storage disorders (alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson's disease), metabolic (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, ), and toxic (alcohol) liver diseases may benefit from augmenting autophagy in hepatocytes. In hepatic fibrosis, autophagy has been implicated in the fibrogenic activation of HSC to collagen-producing myofibroblasts. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), autophagy may contribute to tumor surveillance as well as invasiveness, indicating a dual and stage-dependent function in cancer. As many drugs directly or indirectly modulate autophagy, it is intriguing to investigate autophagy-targeting, possibly even cell type-directed strategies for the treatment of hereditary liver diseases, , fibrosis, and HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31380833>Inducing and Characterizing Vesicular Steatosis in Differentiated HepaRG Cells.</a></h2><p>Hepatic steatosis represents a metabolic dysfunction that results from an accumulation of triglyceride-containing lipid droplets in hepatocytes. Excessive fat accumulation leads to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),  which is potentially reversible and may evolve into non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and eventually cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The molecular mechanisms linking lipid accumulation in hepatocytes with the progression to , irreversible liver damage, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even HCC still remains unclear. To this end, several in vitro and in vivo models have been developed to elucidate the pathological processes that cause NAFLD. In the present study, we describe a cellular model for the induction of liver vesicular steatosis that consists of DMSO-differentiated human hepatic HepaRG cells treated with the fatty  salt sodium oleate. Indeed, sodium oleate-treated HepaRG cells accumulate lipid droplets in the cytoplasm and show typical features of steatosis. This in vitro human model represents a valuable alternative to in vivo mice models as well as to the primary human hepatocytes. We also present a comparison of several methods for the quantification and evaluation of fat accumulation in HepaRG cells, including Oil Red O staining, cytofluorimetric Bodipy measurement, metabolic gene expression analysis by qPCR, and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy. CARS imaging combines the chemical specificity of Raman spectroscopy, a chemical analysis technique well-known in materials science applications, with the benefits of high-speed, high-resolution non-linear optical microscopies to allow precise quantification of lipid accumulation and lipid droplet dynamics. The establishment of an efficient in vitro model for the induction of vesicular steatosis, alongside an accurate method for the quantification and characterization of lipid accumulation, could lead to the development of early stage diagnosis of NAFLD via the identification of molecular markers, and to the generation of new treatment strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30855277>Resolving inflammation in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Chronic unresolved inflammation contributes to the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), a disorder characterized by lipotoxicity, fibrosis, and progressive liver dysfunction.

In this study, we investigated the relationship between bile  composition and -associated fibrosis using a mouse model fed choline-deficient, L-amino--defined, high-fat diet with 0.1% methionine (CDAHFD). C57BL/6 J mice fed CDAHFD developed  and fibrosis within few weeks. With the progress of -associated liver fibrosis, altered bile  composition was observed in the liver, bile, and peripheral plasma. Decreased mRNA levels of bile  metabolizing enzymes such as Cyp7a1 and Baat were observed in contrast to increased Sult2a1 level in the liver. Increased mRNA levels of Ostβ and Abcc4 and decreased in mRNA levels of Bsep, Abcc2, Ntcp, and Oatp1b2, suggesting that bile  efflux from hepatocytes into the peripheral plasma rather than into bile.

How fatty liver pathogenesis is subject to epigenetic regulation is unknown. We hypothesized that chromatin remodeling is important for the pathogenesis of fatty liver disease. AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A), a DNA-binding component of the SWItch/sucrose nonfermentable adenosine triphosphate-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex, contributes to nucleosome repositioning and access by transcriptional regulators. Liver-specific deletion of Arid1a (Arid1a liver knockout [LKO]) caused the development of age-dependent fatty liver disease in mice. Transcriptome analysis revealed up-regulation of lipogenesis and down-regulation of fatty  oxidation genes. As evidence of direct regulation, ARID1A demonstrated direct binding to the promoters of many of these differentially regulated genes. Additionally, Arid1a LKO mice were more susceptible to high-fat diet-induced liver steatosis and fibrosis. We deleted Pten in combination with Arid1a to synergistically drive fatty liver progression. Inhibition of lipogenesis using CAT-2003, a potent sterol regulatory element-binding protein inhibitor, mediated improvements in markers of fatty liver disease progression in this Arid1a/Pten double knockout model. Conclusion: ARID1A plays a role in the epigenetic regulation of hepatic lipid homeostasis, and its suppression contributes to fatty liver pathogenesis.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether epigenetics and environmental factors interact to promote progressive NAFLD during IR. We examined the miRNA signature in insulin receptor haploinsufficient (InsR+/-) and wild-type (wt) HSCs by RNAseq ( = 4 per group). Then, we evaluated their impact in an IR- (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) model (InsR+/- mice fed standard or methionine choline deficient (MCD) diet,  = 10 per group) and in vitro.

We found that miR-101-3p negatively associated with both InsR+/- genotype and MCD ( < 0.05) and the histological spectrum of liver damage ( < 0.01). miR-101-3p was reduced in InsR+/- hepatocytes and HSCs and even more in InsR+/- cells exposed to insulin (0.33 µM) and fatty  (0.25 mM), resembling the IR- model.

In conclusion, IR combined with diet-induced liver injury favors miR-101-3p downregulation, which may promote progressive NAFLD through HSC and hepatocyte transdifferentiation and proliferation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31409057>iPla2β Deficiency Suppresses Hepatic ER UPR, Fxr, and Phospholipids in Mice Fed with MCD Diet, Resulting in Exacerbated Hepatic Bile  and Biliary Cell Proliferation.</a></h2><p>: Group VIA calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPla2β) regulates homeostasis and remodeling of phospholipids (PL). We previously showed that iPla2β mice fed with a methionine-choline-deficient diet (MCD) exhibited exaggerated liver fibrosis. As iPla2β is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), we investigated the mechanisms for this by focusing on hepatic ER unfolded protein response (UPR), ER PL, and enterohepatic bile  (BA).  Female WT (wild-type) and iPla2β mice were fed with chow or MCD for 5 weeks. PL and BA profiles were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Gene expression analyses were performed.  MCD feeding of WT mice caused a decrease of ER PL subclasses, which were further decreased by iPla2β deficiency. This deficiency alone or combined with MCD downregulated the expression of liver ER UPR proteins and farnesoid X-activated receptor. The downregulation under MCD was concomitant with an elevation of BA in the liver and peripheral blood and an increase of biliary epithelial cell proliferation measured by cytokeratin 19.  iPla2β deficiency combined with MCD severely disturbed ER PL composition and caused inactivation of UPR, leading to downregulated Fxr, exacerbated BA, and ductular proliferation. Our study provides insights into iPla2β inactivation for injury susceptibility under normal conditions and liver fibrosis and cholangiopathies during MCD feeding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30703416>Vitamin A signaling and homeostasis in obesity, diabetes, and metabolic disorders.</a></h2><p>Much evidence has accumulated in the literature over the last fifteen years that indicates vitamin A has a role in metabolic disease prevention and causation. This literature proposes that vitamin A can affect obesity development and the development of obesity-related diseases including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis, and cardiovascular disease. Retinoic , the transcriptionally active form of vitamin A, accounts for many of the reported associations. However, a number of proteins involved in vitamin A metabolism, including retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1, alternatively known as retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 or RALDH1), have also been identified as being associated with metabolic disease. Some of the reported effects of these vitamin A-related proteins are proposed to be independent of their roles in assuring normal retinoic  homeostasis. This review will consider both human observational data as well as published data from molecular studies undertaken in rodent models and in cells in culture. The primary focus of the review will be on the effects that vitamin A per se and proteins involved in vitamin A metabolism have on adipocytes, adipose tissue biology, and adipose-related disease, as well as on early stage liver disease, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ().Copyright © 2019.

R17 derived from bouchardatine, shows benefits in the metabolic syndrome, but has not been tested in the liver. The present study examined the pharmacological effects of R17 in a model of NAFLD/ and its mode of action.The effects of R17 were examined in mice fed a high-fat (HF) diet to induce the pathological characteristics of NAFLD/ and in cultures of HuH7 cells. We used histological and immunohistochemical techniques along with western blotting and siRNA. Generation of ROS and apoptosis were measured.Administration of R17 (20 mg·kg , i.p. every other day) for 5 weeks reversed HF-induced hepatic triglyceride content, inflammation (inflammatory cytokines and macrophage numbers), injury (hepatocyte ballooning and apoptosis, plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase), and fibrogenesis (collagen deposition and mRNA expression of fibrosis markers). In cultured cells, R17 reduced cell steatosis from both lipogenesis and fatty  influx. The attenuated inflammation and cell injury were associated with inhibition of both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress. Notably, R17 activated the liver kinase B1-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway by inhibiting activity of ATP synthase, rather than direct stimulation of AMPK.R17 has therapeutic potential for NAFLD/. Its mode of action involves the elimination of ER and oxidative stresses, possibly via activating the LKB1-AMPK axis by inhibiting the activity of ATP synthase.© 2019 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31460584>N-ACETYLCYSTEINE AND/OR URSODEOXYCHOLIC  ASSOCIATED WITH METFORMIN IN NON-ALCOHOLIC STEATOHEPATITIS: AN OPEN-LABEL MULTICENTER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL.</a></h2><p>Nowadays, pharmacological treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is still limited and it is based on the treatment of conditions associated comorbities. Oxidative stress and insulin resistance are the mechanisms that seem to be mostly involved in its pathogenesis.To evaluate the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in combination with metformin (MTF) and/or ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) for treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ().Open-label multicenter randomized trial was conducted for 48 weeks. It included patients with biopsy-proven . The patients were randomized into three groups: NAC (1.2 g) + UDCA (15 mg/kg) + MTF (850-1500 mg/day) (n=26); UDCA (20 mg/kg) + MTF (850-1500 mg/day) (n=13); NAC (1.2g) + MTF (850-1500 mg/day) (n=14) for 48 weeks. Clinical, laboratory and the second liver biopsies were performed after 48 weeks.A total of 53 patients were evaluated; 17 (32.1%) were males; median age ±54 (IQR=15, 21-71) years. In the baseline, no difference was seen between groups according clinical and histological parameters. The groups differed only in cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides. No significant differences in biochemical and histologic parameters were found between these the three groups after 48 weeks of treatment. In the intragroup analysis (intention-to-treat) comparing histological and biochemical features, there were significant improvements in the steatosis degree (P=0.014), ballooning (0.027) and, consequently, in the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) (P=0.005), and in the ALT levels at the end of the treatment only in the NAC + MTF group. No significant evidence of modification in the liver fibrosis could be observed in any of the groups.This multicenter study suggests that the association of NAC + MTF could reduce the liver disease activity in patients with .

We undertook this study to elucidate the interplay between macrophage activation, insulin resistance (IR) in target organs/tissues and hepatic damage.In 40 non-diabetic patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD we assessed: i) endogenous glucose production (EGP), glucose clearance and indexes of IR in the adipose tissue (Adipo-IR and Lipo-IR) and in the liver (Hep-IR) by tracer infusion ([6,6-2H2]glucose and [2H5]glycerol); ii) macrophage activity (by soluble sCD163) and iii) hepatic expression of CD163 (hCD163).We found that sCD163 levels paralleled both the plasma free fatty  (FFA) levels and lipolysis from adipose tissue. Consistently, sCD163 significantly correlated with adipose tissue IR (Adipo-IR: r = 0.32, p = 0.042; Lipo-IR: r = 0.39, p = 0.012). At multiple regression analysis, sCD163 levels were associated with FFA levels (r = 0.35, p = 0.026). In vitro exposure of human monocyte-derived macrophages to palmitate enhanced sCD163 secretion. Conversely, sCD163 did not correlate with EGP or with Hep-IR. In the liver, hCD163 positively correlated with sCD163 (r = 0.58, p = 0.007) and the degree of steatosis (r = 0.34, p = 0.048), but not with EGP or Hep-IR (r = -0.27 and r = 0.11, respectively, p >0.10, both).Our findings suggest a link between deranged metabolism in the adipose tissue and activation of hepatic macrophages in patients with NAFLD, possibly in response to FFA overflow and independent of obesity and diabetes. Conversely, our findings do not support a link between activated hepatic macrophages and glucose metabolism (EGP or Hep-IR). The relationship between adipose tissue IR and hepatic macrophages should be considered to define therapeutic targets for NAFLD.The pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis () is likely due to the interaction between a deranged metabolic milieu and local mediators of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in the insulin resistant state. This study provides in vivo support for a possible link between deranged metabolism in the adipose tissue and activation of hepatic macrophages in patients with NAFLD, most likely in response to free fatty  overflow and independent of obesity and diabetes.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

The development of short- and then long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) followed. Our article charts the discovery and development of the long-acting GLP-1 analogs liraglutide and, subsequently, semaglutide. We examine the chemistry employed in designing liraglutide and semaglutide, the human and non-human studies used to investigate their cellular targets and pharmacological effects, and ongoing investigations into new applications and formulations of these drugs. Reversible binding to albumin was used for the systemic protraction of liraglutide and semaglutide, with optimal fatty  and linker combinations identified to maximize albumin binding while maintaining GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) potency. GLP-1RAs mediate their effects via this receptor, which is expressed in the pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, heart, lungs, kidneys, and brain. GLP-1Rs in the pancreas and brain have been shown to account for the respective improvements in glycemic control and body weight that are evident with liraglutide and semaglutide. Both liraglutide and semaglutide also positively affect cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in individuals with T2D, although the precise mechanism is still being explored. Significant weight loss, through an effect to reduce energy intake, led to the approval of liraglutide (3.0 mg) for the treatment of obesity, an indication currently under investigation with semaglutide. Other ongoing investigations with semaglutide include the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease () and its use in an oral formulation for the treatment of T2D. In summary, rational design has led to the development of two long-acting GLP-1 analogs, liraglutide and semaglutide, that have made a vast contribution to the management of T2D in terms of improvements in glycemic control, body weight, blood pressure, lipids, beta-cell function, and CV outcomes. Furthermore, the development of an oral formulation for semaglutide may provide individuals with additional benefits in relation to treatment adherence.

Ferroptosis is a recently recognized type of cell death characterized by an iron dependent and lipid peroxidation-mediated non-apoptotic cell death. We demonstrate the impact of ferroptosis on the progression of  induced by methionine/choline-deficient diet (MCD) feeding for 10 days. RSL-3 (a ferroptosis inducer) treatment showed decreased hepatic expression of GPX4, and conversely increased 12/15-lipoxygenase, and apoptosis inducing factor, indicating that ferroptosis plays a key role in -related lipid peroxidation and its-associated cell death. Consistently, levels of serum biochemical, hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and apoptosis in MCD-fed mice were exacerbated with RSL-3 treatment. However, MCD-fed mice treated with sodium selenite (a GPX4 activator) showed increase of hepatic GPX4, accompanied by reduced  severity. To chelate iron, deferoxamine mesylate salt was used. Administration of deferoxamine mesylate salt significantly reduced  severity and abolished the harmful effects of RSL-3 in MCD-fed mice. Finally, treatment with Liproxstatin-1 (a ferroptosis inhibitor) repressed hepatic lipid peroxidation, and its associated cell death, resulting in decreased  severity. Consistent with the in vivo findings, modulation of ferroptosis /GPX4 affected hepatocellular death in palmitic -induced in vitro  milieu.

A hot water extract of  (WEC) has been reported to show antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, but its effect on hepatic inflammation is poorly understood. In the present study, to investigate the effect of WEC on non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, C57BL/6J mice were fed a low-methionine, choline-deficient diet with 0·175 % WEC (WEC group) or without WEC (control group) for 6 or 12 weeks. Although hepatic steatosis was similar in the WEC group and the control group, WEC suppressed the elevation of plasma aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, which are markers of hepatocellular damage. Compared with the control group, the WEC group had higher hepatic levels of reduced glutathione and superoxide dismutase, as well as a lower hepatic level of thiobarbituric -reactive substances. WEC also reduced hepatic expression of mRNA for inflammatory factors, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, F4/80 and CC motif chemokine receptor 2. Histological examination revealed that WEC suppressed hepatic recruitment of F4/80 monocytes/macrophages and inhibited hepatic fibrosis. Furthermore, WEC inhibited hepatic expression of mRNA for molecules related to fibrosis, such as transforming growth factor-β, α-smooth muscle actin, type I collagen (α1-chain) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1.

Over the last two decades, basic science studies have uncovered molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of chronic liver diseases, leading to the recent development of new anti-fibrotic drugs. These new drugs target different steps in the pathophysiology of chronic liver injury: metabolism of glucose, lipids and bile , apoptosis, inflammation and fibrosis.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of dietary iron restriction on disease progression in rats fed a choline-deficient L-amino -defined (CDAA) diet. Male F344 rats were fed a choline-sufficient amino -defined (control) diet, a CDAA diet or an iron-restricted CDAA diet for 4, 8 and 12 weeks. At each time point, hepatic iron levels, oxidative stress, inflammation and fibrosis were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The iron-restricted CDAA diet significantly decreased serum iron levels for 12 weeks compared with the CDAA diet. Histological analysis confirmed that feeding with the CDAA diet induced hepatic iron overload and that this was associated with oxidative stress (number of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine-positive cells), inflammation (CD68 positive area) and fibrosis (Sirius Red positive area). Iron restriction with the CDAA diet significantly led to a reduction in the hepatic iron levels, oxidative stress, inflammation and fibrosis.

Despite its increased global incidence, very few promising treatments for  are available. Pirfenidone is an antifibrotic agent used to treat pulmonary fibrosis; it suppresses the pulmonary influx of T cells and macrophages. Here, we investigated the effect of pirfenidone in a mouse model of lipotoxicity-induced  via a high-cholesterol and high-fat diet.

The enzyme glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), the most important enzyme implicated in S-adenosylmethionine catabolism in the liver, is downregulated during NAFLD progression. We have studied the mechanism involved in GNMT downregulation by its repressor microRNA miR-873-5p and the metabolic pathways affected in NAFLD as well as the benefit of recovery GNMT expression.miR-873-5p and GNMT expression were evaluated in liver biopsies of NAFLD/ patients. Different in vitro and in vivo NAFLD murine models were used to assess miR-873-5p/GNMT involvement in fatty liver progression through targeting of the miR-873-5p as NAFLD therapy.We describe a new function of GNMT as an essential regulator of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain in the mitochondria. In NAFLD, GNMT expression is controlled by miR-873-5p in the hepatocytes, leading to disruptions in mitochondrial functionality in a preclinical murine non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () model. Upregulation of miR-873-5p is shown in the liver of NAFLD/ patients, correlating with hepatic GNMT depletion. Importantly,  therapies based on anti-miR-873-5p resolve lipid accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis by enhancing fatty  β-oxidation in the mitochondria. Therefore, miR-873-5p inhibitor emerges as a potential tool for  treatment.GNMT participates in the regulation of metabolic pathways and mitochondrial functionality through the regulation of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain.

Myostatin (Mstn) and adiponectin, secreted by muscle cells and adipocytes, respectively, play important roles in regulating insulin signaling and energy metabolism. The mechanisms underlying the actions of Mstn and adiponectin remain largely unknown. Moreover, the interactions between Mstn and adiponectin in regulating gene expression critical for fatty  metabolism and insulin action in hepatocytes have not been investigated. The effects of Mstn and AdipoRon, a synthetic adiponectin receptor agonist that is orally active, alone or in combination, on hepatic gene expression and function was investigated. While Mstn increased fatty  (FA) accumulation and desensitized cellular responses to insulin, AdipoRon protected against Mstn-induced defects in hepatic gene expression and function. In addition, these effects of Mstn were associated with reduced AMPK and PPARα activities which were reversed by AdipoRon. Finally, AdipoRon was able to prevent Mstn-induced activation of the Smad2/3 pathway. These data suggest crosstalk between Mstn-induced Smad2/3 and adiponectin-induced AMPK/PPARα pathways, which may play important roles in the regulation of hepatic gene expression critical for FA metabolism and insulin signaling. In addition, the data suggest that AdipoRon, as an adiponectin receptor agonist, may serve a therapeutic role to reduce the hepatic contribution to the disorders of fat metabolism and insulin action.© 2019 The Authors.

Associated with the metabolic syndrome, NAFLD is mostly driven by insulin-resistant white adipose tissue lipolysis that results in an increased hepatic fatty  influx and the ectopic accumulation of fat in the liver. Upregulation of beta-oxidation as one compensatory mechanism leads to an increase in mitochondrial tricarboxylic  cycle flux and ATP generation. The progression of NAFLD is associated with alterations in the mitochondrial molecular composition and respiratory capacity, which increases their vulnerability to different stressors, including calcium and pro-inflammatory molecules, which result in an increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that, altogether, may ultimately lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. This may activate further pro-inflammatory pathways involved in the progression from steatosis to steatohepatitis (). Mushroom-enriched diets, or the administration of their isolated bioactive compounds, have been shown to display beneficial effects on insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation by regulating nutrient uptake and lipid metabolism as well as modulating the antioxidant activity of the cell. In addition, the gut microbiota has also been described to be modulated by mushroom bioactive molecules, with implications in reducing liver inflammation during NAFLD progression. Dietary mushroom extracts have been reported to have anti-tumorigenic properties and to induce cell-death via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. This calls for particular attention to the potential therapeutic properties of these natural compounds which may push the development of novel pharmacological options to treat  and HCC. We here review the diverse effects of mushroom-enriched diets in liver disease, emphasizing those effects that are dependent on mitochondria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700851>Impaired mitophagy triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation during the progression from nonalcoholic fatty liver to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Activation of inflammation is an important mechanism in the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). This study aims to delineate how mitophagy affects NLRP3 inflammasome activation in hepatic lipotoxicity. Mice were fed a high fat/calorie diet (HFCD) for 24 weeks. Primary rat hepatocytes were treated with palmitic  (PA) for various periods of time. Mitophagy was measured by protein levels of LC3II and P62. NLRP3, caspase-1, interleukin (IL)-18, and IL-1β at mRNA and protein levels were used as indicators of inflammasome activation. Along with steatotic progression in HFCD-fed mice, ratio of LC3II/β-actin was decreased concurrently with increased levels of liver P62, NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1β, IL-18, and serum IL-1β levels in late-stage . PA treatment resulted in mitochondrial oxidative stress and initiated mitophagy in primary hepatocytes. The addition of cyclosporine A did not change LC3II/Τοmm20 ratios; but P62 levels were increased after an extended duration of PA exposure, indicating a defect in autophagic activity. Along with impaired mitophagy, mRNA and protein levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-18 and IL-1β were upregulated by PA treatment. Pretreatment with MCC950, N-acetyl cysteine or acetyl-L-carnitine reversed inflammasome activation and a pyroptotic cascade. Additionally, mitophagic flux was partially recovered as indicated by increases in LC3II/Tomm20 ratio, parkin, and PINK1 expression, and decreased P62 expression. The findings suggest that impaired mitophagy triggers hepatic NLRP3 inflammasome activation in a murine  model and primary hepatocytes.

Towards this aim, wild-type (WT) and VN-/- mice were fed with a choline-deficient, L-amino -defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD) for 6 and 10 weeks to induce , and the livers were isolated. In WT mice fed with CDAHFD for 6 and 10 weeks, the expression of Vn mRNA and protein was up-regulated compared with that in mice fed with the MF control diet, indicating that VN is regulated in  condition. VN-/- mice showed decreased picrosirius red staining in the liver area and Col1a2 mRNA expression levels, compared with WT mice, indicating that the severity of hepatic fibrosis is attenuated in the CDAHFD-fed VN-/- mice. In addition, VN deficiency did not affect the area of lipid droplets in haematoxylin-eosin staining and the mRNA expression levels of fatty  synthases, Srebp, Acc and Fas in the CDAHFD-fed mice. Moreover, VN deficiency decreased the inflammation score and the mRNA expression levels of Cd11b and F4/80, macrophage markers, as well as Tnf-α and Il-1β, inflammatory cytokines in the CDAHFD-fed mice. Furthermore, VN deficiency decreased the protein and mRNA expression levels of α-smooth muscle actin in the CDAHFD-fed mice, suggesting that VN deficiency inhibits the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs).

However, efficacious pharmacological treatment for  is lacking. A major issue for preclinical evaluation of potential therapeutics for  is the limited number of appropriate animal models, i.e., models that do not require long-term dietary intervention and adequately mimic disease progression in humans. The present study aimed to evaluate a 3-wk dietary mouse model of  and validate it by studying the effects of liraglutide, a compound in advanced clinical development for . C57BL6/J mice were fed a diet high in fat (60%), cholesterol (1.25%), and cholic  (0.5%), along with 2% hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin in drinking water (HFCC-CDX diet). Histological and biological parameters were measured at 1 and 3 wk. After 1-wk diet induction, liraglutide was administrated daily for 2 wk and then -associated phenotypic aspects were evaluated in comparison with control mice. Prior to treatment with liraglutide, mice fed the HFCC-CDX diet for 1 wk developed liver steatosis and had increased levels of oxidative-stress markers and hepatic and systemic inflammation. For mice not treated with liraglutide, these aspects were even more pronounced after 3 wk of the dietary period, with additional liver insulin resistance and fibrosis. Liraglutide treatment corrected the diet-induced alterations in glucose metabolism and significantly reduced hepatic steatosis and inflammation.

People gain nutrients from a varied diet, although fish-which are a rich source of bioavailable micronutrients that are essential to human health-are often overlooked. A lack of understanding of the nutrient composition of most fish and how nutrient yields vary among fisheries has hindered the policy shifts that are needed to effectively harness the potential of fisheries for food and nutrition security. Here, using the concentration of 7 nutrients in more than 350 species of marine fish, we estimate how environmental and ecological traits predict nutrient content of marine finfish species. We use this predictive model to quantify the global spatial patterns of the concentrations of nutrients in marine fisheries and compare nutrient yields to the prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies in human populations. We find that species from tropical thermal regimes contain higher concentrations of calcium, iron and zinc; smaller species contain higher concentrations of calcium, iron and omega-3 fatty ; and species from cold thermal regimes or those with a pelagic feeding pathway contain higher concentrations of omega-3 fatty . There is no relationship between nutrient concentrations and total fishery yield, highlighting that the nutrient quality of a fishery is determined by the species composition. For a number of countries in which nutrient intakes are inadequate, nutrients available in marine finfish catches exceed the dietary requirements for populations that live within 100 km of the coast, and a fraction of current landings could be particularly impactful for children under 5 years of age.

Demographic data and laboratory studies on plasma samples were obtained within 6 months of liver biopsy. Wild-type and PAR2-KO (C57BL/6 F2rl1) mice were fed either normal or high fat diet for 16 weeks and plasma and liver assayed for lipids and soluble metabolites.Severity of NAFLD and plasma cholesterol levels significantly correlated with hepatocyte PAR2 expression in NAFLD patients. Conversely, PAR2 deficiency in mice resulted in reduced expression of key hepatic genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, a 50% drop in plasma and total liver cholesterol, and induced a reverse cholesterol transport system that culminated in 25% higher fecal bile  output. PAR2-deficient mice exhibited enhanced fatty  β-oxidation with a ketogenic shift and an unexpected increase in liver glycogenesis. Mechanistic studies identified G-Jnk1/2 as key downstream effectors of protease-activated PAR2 in the regulation of lipid and cholesterol homeostasis in liver.These data indicate that PAR2 may be a new target for the suppression of plasma cholesterol and hepatic fat accumulation in NAFLD and related metabolic conditions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Rare earth elements are vital to green and emerging technologies, with demand set to outstrip supply. Apatite provides a possible future source of REE. Processing rare earth deposits is often complex, with surface behaviour having a significant effect on the optimization of a process flow sheet. The effect of enrichment of natural apatite and the doping of synthetic apatite on surface behaviour can be determined by measuring the zeta potential and the isoelectric point of the mineral. In this paper, we review zeta potential studies of natural and synthetic apatite to determine the effect of elemental enrichment on surface behaviour. Fifty three studies of natural apatite and forty four studies of synthetic apatite were reviewed. The isoelectric point of apatite varied from pH 1 to pH 8.7, with studies of apatite specified to be >90% pure reducing the variation to pH 3 to pH 6.5. Of the four studies of rare earth enriched apatite found, three had IEP values between pH 3 and pH 4. A study of synthetic apatite showing enrichment of between 1 and 10% by the REE europium does not affect surface behaviour. However, no studies were found that investigated the effect of common REE processing reagents on REE enriched apatite zeta potentials. Therefore, in addition to comparing previous studies we also therefore present new zeta potential measurements of apatite from a REE enriched deposit under water and common flotation collector conditions. The IEP value of this apatite under water conditions was at pH 3.6, shifting to <3.5 under both hydroxamic  and betacol conditions. When compared to previous studies, the behaviour of REE enriched apatite under collector conditions is similar to non-REE apatite. This result could be important for future processing of apatite enriched with REE, and therefore global apatite and rare earth supply.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Many studies have demonstrated that the microbiome is closely associated with the progression of nutrition-related diseases, especially of fatty liver disease. Changes in the quantity and quality of the intestinal flora, commonly referred to as dysbiosis, result in altered food metabolism, increased permeability of the intestinal barrier ("leaky gut") and consecutive inflammatory processes in the liver. This favors both the progression of obesity and metabolic disorders as well as NAFLD towards non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Important molecular mechanisms include microbial metabolites, microbial and endogenous signaling substances (so-called PAMPs/DAMPs) as well as bile . Essential cellular mechanisms include immune cells in the gut and liver, especially macrophages and Kupffer cells, as well as intestinal epithelial cells and hepatocytes as central regulators of metabolism. In this review article, we briefly summarize the relevant species of the human microbiome, describe the microbial analytics, explain the most important molecular relationships between microbiome and NAFLD/, and finally the opportunities and challenges of microbiome-modulating therapy for the treatment of fatty liver disease.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31489674>Dietary chia seeds (Salvia hispanica) improve acute dyslipidemia and steatohepatitis in rats.</a></h2><p>Chia seeds (Salvia hispanica L.) are rich in omega fatty . Dyslipidemia and steatohepatitis are diseases that require effective treatments in obese and non-obese patients. The aim was to evaluate the effect of chia intake on acute tyloxapol (TI)-induced dyslipidemia, on acute carbon tetrachloride (TC)-induced steatohepatitis, and on mixed damage (TC+TI) in non-obese rats. Four experimental groups were fed for 4 weeks a diet with established rodent food (DE), and four groups were fed a diet with 15% added chia (DC). Plasma samples were analyzed for total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, biochemical liver damage markers, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Liver samples were used to quantify glycogen, catalase, lipid peroxidation, and TNF-α. A histopathological analysis was performed. DC intake partially or totally prevented steatohepatitis, and reduced lipids in the dyslipidemic groups. The hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective effects of chia may be correlated to its high content of α-linolenic  (omega-3) and phenolics. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Metabolic syndrome is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), which are currently the most common causes of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. Dyslipidemia is a significant risk factor for NAFLD and . Non-obese patients may have NAFLD or . Metabolic syndrome and dyslipidemia are more strongly associated with NAFLD in non-obese than in obese patients. This is the first study evaluating the hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective effects of chia seed intake on acute dyslipidemia and/or steatohepatitis caused by the individual or combined administration of the inducers tyloxapol and carbon tetrachloride, respectively, in non-obese rats. The pharmacological effects of dietary chia are correlated to its high content of omega-3 and omega-6 (1:1), protein, dietary fiber, and phenolics. The results suggest that inclusion of chia in diets of non-obese patients with dyslipidemia and/or NAFLD/ may improve their health state and preventing cirrhosis or HCC.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31506421>Indole-3-propionic  inhibits gut dysbiosis and endotoxin leakage to attenuate steatohepatitis in rats.</a></h2><p>Microbial metabolites have emerged as critical components that mediate the metabolic effects of the gut microbiota. Here, we show that indole-3-propionic  (IPA), a tryptophan metabolite produced by gut bacteria, is a potent anti-non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () microbial metabolite. Here, we demonstrate that administration of IPA modulates the microbiota composition in the gut and inhibits microbial dysbiosis in rats fed a high-fat diet. IPA induces the expression of tight junction proteins, such as ZO-1 and Occludin, and maintains intestinal epithelium homeostasis, leading to a reduction in plasma endotoxin levels. Interestingly, IPA inhibits NF-κB signaling and reduces the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6, in response to endotoxin in macrophages to repress hepatic inflammation and liver injury. Moreover, IPA is sufficient to inhibit the expression of fibrogenic and collagen genes and attenuate diet-induced  phenotypes. The beneficial effects of IPA on the liver are likely mediated through inhibiting the production of endotoxin in the gut. These findings suggest a protective role of IPA in the control of metabolism and uncover the gut microbiome and liver cross-talk in regulating the intestinal microenvironment and liver pathology via a novel dietary nutrient metabolite. IPA may provide a new therapeutic strategy for treating .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31213868>The negative and detrimental effects of high fructose on the liver, with special reference to metabolic disorders.</a></h2><p>The increased consumption of fructose in the average diet through sweeteners such as high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) and sucrose has resulted in negative outcomes in society through producing a considerable economic and medical burden on our healthcare system. Ingestion of fructose chronically has contributed to multiple health consequences, such as insulin resistance, obesity, liver disorders, and diabetes. Fructose metabolism starts with fructose phosphorylation by fructose kinase in the liver, and this process is not feedback regulated. Therefore, ingestion of high fructose can deplete ATP, increase uric  production, and increase nucleotide turnover. This review focuses the discussion on the hepatic manifestations of high fructose-implicated liver metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance, obesity due to enhanced lipogenesis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), and type 2 diabetes. The detrimental effects of high fructose on the liver, contributed potentially by microbiome and leptin, were also discussed. The authors believe that, together with diet management, further studies focusing on disrupting or blocking fructose metabolism in the liver may help with designing novel strategies for prevention and treatment of fructose-induced chronic liver metabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31357780>[A new attempt with lipoprotein lipase agonists in the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis].</a></h2><p> To analyze non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ()-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by bioinformatics methods to find key pathways and potential therapeutic targets for .

The Limma software package in R language was used to screen DEGs under the condition of difference multiple > 1.5 and adj.  < 0.05. The clusterProfiler software package was used for GO analysis and KEGG analysis. The STRING online database was used for protein-protein interaction analysis, and the L1000 and DrugBank databases were used for drug prediction.  Compared with healthy control group, 857 DEGs were screened out in  group including 167 up-regulated genes and 690 down-regulated genes. GO analysis showed that DEGs were mainly involved in inflammation and cholesterol metabolism. KEGG analysis showed that DEGs were mainly enriched in PPAR, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, oxidative phosphorylation and other signaling pathways. Among them, eight genes of ACSL4, CYP7A1, FABP4, FABP5, lipoprotein lipase, ME1, OLR1 and PLIN1 were enriched in PPAR signaling pathway, and 165 interaction nodes were formed with 47 DEGs-encoded proteins. Lipoprotein lipase interacted with 21 DEGs, and its up-regulated expression had improved lipid metabolism, insulin resistance and anti-inflammatory effects. Four drugs (gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, omega-3 carboxylic  and glycyrrhizic ) were screened by L1000 and DrugBank to activate lipoprotein lipase. Presently, these four drugs are clinically used to treat hypertriglyceridemia or to improve inflammation. In this regard, we speculated that the pharmacological effects of these four drugs had improved  by activating lipoprotein lipase to promote liver lipid metabolism and alleviate inflammation.

The modulation of gut microbiota, bile  and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis is correlated with obesity-induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the interactions among the gut microbiota, bile  and FXR in metabolic disorders remained largely unexplored in hamsters. In the current study, hamsters fed a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) were administered vehicle or an antibiotic cocktail by gavage twice a week for four weeks. Antibiotic treatment alleviated HFD-induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis and inflammation accompanied with decreased hepatic lipogenesis and elevated thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). In the livers of antibiotic-treated hamsters, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1 (CYP7B1) in the alternative bile  synthesis pathway was upregulated, contributing to a more hydrophilic bile  profile with increased tauro--muricholic  (TMCA). The intestinal FXR signaling was suppressed but remained unchanged in the liver.

Uric  is an endogenous danger signal and activator of the inflammasome, and has been independently associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis.six hundred and thirty-four patients from the nation-wide HEPAMET registry with biopsy-proven NAFLD (53% ) were analyzed to determine whether hyperuricemia is related with advanced liver damage in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Patients were divided into three groups according to the tertile levels of serum uric  and gender.the cohort was composed of 50% females, with a mean age of 49 years (range 19-80). Patients in the top third of serum uric  levels were older (p = 0.017); they had a higher body mass index (p < 0.01), arterial blood pressure (p = 0.05), triglyceridemia (p = 0.012), serum creatinine (p < 0.001) and total cholesterol (p = 0.016) and lower HDL-cholesterol (p = 0.004). According to the univariate analysis, the variables associated with patients in the top third were more advanced steatosis (p = 0.02), liver fibrosis (F2-F4 vs F0-1; p = 0.011),  (p = 0.002) and NAS score (p = 0.05).

In the past decade, increasing attention has been paid to understand the association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (n-3 PUFAs) and ALD. In this review, we summarize the metabolism of n-3 PUFAs, animal model of ALD, and the findings from recent studies determining the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD as a possible treatment. The animal models of acute ethanol exposure, chronic ethanol exposure and chronic-plus-single binge ethanol feeding have been widely used to explore the impact of n-3 PUFAs. Although the results of studies regarding the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD have been inconsistent or controversial, increasing evidence has demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs may be useful in alleviating alcoholic steatosis and alcohol-induced liver injury through multiple mechanisms, including decreased  lipogenesis and lipid mobilization from adipose tissue, enhanced mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation, reduced hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, and promoted intestinal homeostasis, positively suggesting that n-3 PUFAs might be promising for the management of ALD. The oxidation of n-3 PUFAs  in an experimental diet was rarely considered in most n-3 PUFA-related studies, likely contributing to the inconsistent results. Thus, the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD deserves greater research efforts and remains to be evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled clinic trial.

This study investigates the transcriptional regulation and the impact of fibrosis stage, of pathways relating to hepatic lipid and cholesterol homeostasis, inflammation and fibrosis using RT-qPCR in the guinea pig  model. Animals were fed a chow (4% fat), a high-fat (20% fat, 0.35% cholesterol) or high-fat/high-sucrose (20% fat, 15% sucrose, 0.35% cholesterol) diet for 16 or 25 weeks (n = 7/group/time point). High-fat diets induced . In , markers of hepatic de novo lipogenesis were enhanced (e.g. FASN, > twofold, p < 0.05) while markers of mitochondrial, peroxisomal and cytochrome fatty  oxidation were reduced (e.g. CPT1A > twofold, p < 0.05). Markers of fatty  uptake were unaltered or decreased. Likewise, expression of cholesterol uptake and synthesis markers were decreased, whereas genes relating to lipid and cholesterol export were unaltered. Inflammatory and chemotactic cytokines were enhanced alongside fibrogenic pathways including increased hepatic stellate cell activation and migration, matrix deposition (e.g. MCP1, TNFα, β-PDGF and Col1a1, > threefold, p < 0.05) and decreased matrix degradation. Fibrosis stage (mild vs. severe) and progression did generally not affect the expression of the investigated pathways. This suggests that liver dysfunction at the transcriptional level is induced early and maintained throughout fibrosis progression, allowing potential treatments to target dysregulated pathways already at early disease stages. As the guinea pig  model mimics several aspects of human molecular pathophysiology, these results may be used to increase the current understanding of  pathology and explore future treatment targets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31388096>Circulating microbiota-derived metabolites: a "liquid biopsy?</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) causes a wide spectrum of liver damage, from simple steatosis (SS) to cirrhosis.

The most severe form is nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). Among risk factors for the development of NAFLD is excessive lipid intake. Since palm (P) oil is the most consumed oil in the world, we aimed to investigate the effects of high-fat diets made with P oil, hybrid palm (HP) oil, or olive (O) oil in liver. Twenty-four male mice (C57Bl/6J) were fed a high-fat diet (41% fat) containing P, HP, or O oils for 8 weeks and compared to a control (C) group fed a chow diet. Adiposity was measured with computed tomography. Body, adipose tissue, and liver weights, as well as liver fat (Bligh⁻Dyer), blood lipid profile, glucose, and liver enzymes were measured. Liver histology (hematoxylin⁻eosin) and transcriptome (microarray-based) were performed. ANOVA tests with Newman⁻Keuls were used. Body weight was increased in the P group ( < 0.001) and body fat in the O group (C vs. O  ≤ 0.01, P vs. O  ≤ 0.05, HP vs. O  ≤ 0.05). All high-fat diets disturbed the blood lipid profile and glucose, with marked effects of HP on very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL), triglycerides, and alkaline phosphatase ( ≤ 0.001). HP had the highest liver fat (42.76 ± 1.58), followed by P (33.94 ± 1.13). O had a fat amount comparable to C (16.46 ± 0.34, 14.71 ± 0.70, respectively). P and HP oils induced hepatocyte ballooning. Transcriptome alterations of the O group were related to amino  metabolism and fatty  (FA) metabolism, the P group to calcium ion homeostasis, and HP oil to protein localization. Both P and HP oils induced  in mice via disturbed hepatocyte transcription.

As a consequence, genetic deletion of SRSF3 in hepatocytes caused progressive liver disease and ultimately led to hepatocellular carcinoma. Here we show that SRSF3 is decreased in human liver samples with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), or cirrhosis that was associated with alterations in RNA splicing of known SRSF3 target genes. Hepatic SRSF3 expression was similarly decreased and RNA splicing dysregulated in mouse models of NAFLD and . We showed that palmitic -induced oxidative stress caused conjugation of the ubiquitin like NEDD8 protein to SRSF3 and proteasome mediated degradation. SRSF3 was selectively neddylated at lysine11 and mutation of this residue (SRSF3-K11R) was sufficient to prevent both SRSF3 degradation and alterations in RNA splicing. Finally prevention of SRSF3 degradation in vivo partially protected mice from hepatic steatosis, fibrosis and inflammation.

Native GABA receptor complexes contain the principal subunits GABA and GABA, which form an obligate heterodimer, and auxiliary subunits, known as potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing proteins (KCTDs). KCTDs interact with GABA receptors and modify the kinetics of GABA receptor signaling. Little is known about the molecular mechanism governing the direct association and functional coupling of GABA receptors with these auxiliary proteins. Here, we describe the high-resolution structure of the KCTD16 oligomerization domain in complex with part of the GABA receptor. A single GABA C-terminal peptide is bound to the interior of an open pentamer formed by the oligomerization domain of five KCTD16 subunits. Mutation of specific amino  identified in the structure of the GABA-KCTD16 interface disrupted both the biochemical association and functional modulation of GABA receptors and G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K channel (GIRK) channels. These interfacial residues are conserved among KCTDs, suggesting a common mode of KCTD interaction with GABA receptors.

We hypothesized that dietary glycotoxins could impair hepatic lipid metabolism in obesity contributing to lipotoxicity-driven insulin resistance and thus to the onset of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). In diet-induced obese rats with methylglyoxal-induced glycation, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and gas chromatography were used to assess liver composition in fatty acyl chains and phospholipids. High-fat diet-induced obesity increased liver lipid fraction and suppressed de novo lipogenesis but did not change fatty  esterification and saturation or insulin sensitivity. Despite a similar increase in total lipid fraction when supplementing the high-fat diet with dietary glycotoxins, impairment in the suppression of de novo lipogenesis and decreased fatty  unsaturation and esterification were observed. Moreover, glycotoxins also decreased polyunsaturated cardiolipins and caused oxidative stress, portal inflammation, and insulin resistance in high-fat diet-induced obese rats. Dietary glycated products do not change total lipid levels in the liver of obese rats but dramatically modify the lipidemic profile, leading to oxidative stress, hepatic lipotoxicity, and insulin resistance in obesity and thus contribute to the onset of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31361543>eNOS deletion impairs mitochondrial quality control and exacerbates Western diet-induced .</a></h2><p>Dysregulated mitochondrial quality control leads to mitochondrial functional impairments that are central to the development and progression of hepatic steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ().

Mice lacking eNOS were more susceptible to Western diet-induced hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in conjunction with decreased markers of mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover. The hepatocyte-specific influence was verified via magnetic activated cell sorting purified primary hepatocytes and in vitro siRNA-induced knockdown of eNOS.

By differentiating edited iPSCs into hepatocytes and knocking down SIRT1, we found increased fatty  biosynthesis that exacerbates fat accumulation. To model human fatty livers, we repopulated decellularized rat livers with human mesenchymal cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, and human SIRT1 knockdown iPSC-derived hepatocytes and found that the human iPSC-derived liver tissue developed macrosteatosis, acquired proinflammatory phenotype, and shared a similar lipid and metabolic profiling to human fatty livers. Biofabrication of genetically edited human liver tissue may become an important tool for investigating human liver biology and disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

NAFLD is predicted to soon become the main cause of liver morbidity and transplantation. The disease is characterized by a progressive increase of lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, which eventually induce fibrosis and inflammation, and can ultimately cause cirrhosis and hepatic carcinoma. Here, we created a patterned model of NAFLD on a chip using free fatty  gradients to recapitulate a spectrum of disease conditions in a single continuous liver tissue. We established the NAFLD progression via quantification of intracellular lipid accumulation and transcriptional levels of fatty  transporters and NAFLD pathogenesis markers. We then used this platform to create oxygen driven steatosis zonation mimicking the sinusoidal lipid distribution on a single continuous tissue and showed that this fat zonation disappears under progressed steatosis, in agreement with in vivo observations and recent computational studies. While we focus on free fatty  and oxygen as the drivers of NAFLD, the microfluidic platform here is extensible to simultaneous use of other drivers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31043271>Hepatocellular iNOS protects liver from  through Nrf2-dependent activation of HO-1.</a></h2><p>Multiple molecular events are involved in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (). There is no consensus on the role of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the progression of . The present study therefore investigated the role of iNOS in  pathogenesis using bone marrow-transplanted iNOS chimeric mice under high-fat diet (HFD) conditions. The chimeric mice were fed a HFD for 16 wk, and primary hepatocytes were stimulated with oleic  (OA). The molecular mechanisms underlying the role of iNOS in  were investigated. Marked hepatic steatosis and injury observed in the HFD mice and OA-stimulated hepatocytes were reduced by hepatocyte-derived iNOS. Mechanistically, iNOS upregulated heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) by augmenting nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) binding to the HO-1 gene promoter. In conclusion, hepatocyte-derived iNOS may play a protective role against the progression of  by upregulating HO-1 through Nrf-2.

Despite several agents being under development for treating , there are no drugs currently approved. The Farnesoid-x-receptor (FXR) and the G-protein coupled bile  receptor 1 (GPBAR1), two bile  activated receptors, have been investigated for their potential in treating . Here we report that BAR502, a steroidal dual ligand for FXR/GPBAR1, attenuates development of clinical and liver histopathology features of  in mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) and fructose (F). By RNAseq analysis of liver transcriptome we found that BAR502 restores FXR signaling in the liver of mice feed HFD-F, and negatively regulates a cluster of genes including Srebf1 (Srepb1c) and its target genes-fatty  synthase (Fasn) and Cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector (CIDE) genes, Cidea and Cidec-involved in lipid droplets formation and triglycerides storage in hepatocytes. Additionally, BAR502 increased the intestinal expression of Fgf15 and Glp1 and energy expenditure by white adipose tissues.

As mitochondrial dysfunction and lipotoxicity are central features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), we tested whether Exe improved mitochondrial function in this setting. We studied C57BL/6J mice fed for 24 weeks either a control- or high-fructose, high-trans-fat (TFD)-diet (i.e., a  model previously validated by our laboratory). For the final 8 weeks, mice were treated with Exe (30 µg/kg/day) or vehicle. Mitochondrial metabolism was assessed by infusion of [13C3]propionate, [3,4-13C2]glucose and NMR-based 13C-isotopomer analysis. Exenatide significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose, free fatty  and triglycerides, as well as adipose tissue insulin resistance. Moreover, Exe reduced 23% hepatic glucose production, 15% tri-carboxylic  (TCA) cycle flux, 20% anaplerosis and 17% pyruvate cycling resulting in a significant 31% decrease in intrahepatic triglyceride content (P = 0.02). Exenatide improved the lipidomic profile and decreased hepatic lipid byproducts associated with insulin resistance and lipotoxicity, such as diacylglycerols (TFD: 111 ± 13 vs Exe: 64 ± 13 µmol/g protein, P = 0.03) and ceramides (TFD: 1.6 ± 0.1 vs Exe: 1.3 ± 0.1 µmol/g protein, P = 0.03). Exenatide lowered expression of hepatic lipogenic genes (Srebp1C, Cd36) and genes involved in inflammation and fibrosis (Tnfa, Timp1). In conclusion, in a diet-induced mouse model of , Exe ameliorates mitochondrial TCA cycle flux and significantly decreases insulin resistance, steatosis and hepatocyte lipotoxicity. This may have significant clinical implications to the potential mechanism of action of GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with .

Liver biopsies were assessed for presence of , degree of fibrosis and inflammation. Multivariate analysis was performed to assess associations between HLA genes and different histologic features of NAFLD.Our data for HLA class I showed that HLA-C*4 was associated with lower risk for histologic  and HLA-C*6 was protective against portal fibrosis. Conversely, HLA-B*27 was associated with high-grade hepatic steatosis, while HLA-A*31 was associated with increased risk for advanced fibrosis.

NAFLD begins with excessive lipid accumulation in the liver and progresses to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () and cirrhosis. NAFLD is closely linked to dysregulated hepatic lipid metabolism. Although recent studies have reported that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling regulates lipid metabolism, the roles of EGFR and EGFR inhibitors as modulators of lipid metabolism are largely unknown. Here, we investigated whether inhibiting EGFR using the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) PD153035 improves NAFLD. Our results demonstrate that EGFR was activated in liver tissues from high fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mice. Inhibiting EGFR using PD153035 significantly reduced phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling and sterol responsive elementary binding protein 1 and 2 expression, which prevented HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and hypercholesterolemia by reducing de novo lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis and enhancing fatty  oxidation. Additionally, inhibiting EGFR improved HFD-induced glucose intolerance.

We recently developed a novel procedure based on sialic  linkage-specific alkylamidation via lactone ring opening (aminolysis-SALSA). Herein, we have investigated an isotope labeling of α2,3-linked sialic  residues (iSALSA) using amine hydrochloride salts. One limitation of SALSA using amine hydrochloride salts may be solved by adding only -butylamine (t-BA) as an  scavenger, and comparative and quantitative glycomic analyses can be performed using iSALSA. We also developed quantitative glycomic analysis using dual isotope-labeled glycans by derivatizing with aminooxy-functionalized tryptophanylarginine methyl ester (aoWR) and iSALSA at the reducing and nonreducing end, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the amount of α2,3-linked sialoglycans in serum are altered during liver fibrosis using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and liquid chromatography MS (LC/MS) analyses. We revealed that the ratio of A3 to A3F was gradually decreased along with liver fibrosis progression.

The aim of this study is to elucidate precisely the association between the area of lipid droplets (LDs) and the plasma metabolic parameters in patients with NAFLD/.Eighty patients with NAFLD/ diagnosed by needle biopsy were enrolled. The LDs around zone 3 were counted automatically by image processing software, the total area of LDs (TLDs), the maximum area of LDs (MAXLDs), the average area of LDs (AVELDs) and the heterogeneity by the coefficient of variation (CV [%]) were quantified. The correlations between these values and plasma metabolic parameters were analyzed. We evaluated the association between branched chain amino  (BCAAs) and the heterogeneity of LDs in hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo.The MAXLDs was significantly correlated with more metabolic parameters than AVELDs and TLDs. The level of BCAAs was independently associated with the CV among the metabolic parameters. In early stage NAFLD, aspartate and alanine aminotransferase were significantly higher in the high CV group than in the low CV group. The high concentration of BCAAs increased the CV of LDs in hepatocytes accompanied by the expression of phosphor-p70 S6 kinase and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 in vitro.

However, there are inadequate phytoassessment studies conducted using EDTA in Vetiver grass. Hence, this study evaluates the phytoassessment (growth performance, accumulation trends, and proficiency of metal uptake) of Vetiver grass, Vetiveria zizanioides (Linn.)  in both single and mixed heavy metal (Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn)-disodium EDTA-enhanced contaminated soil. The plant growth, metal accumulation, and overall efficiency of metal uptake by different plant parts (lower root, upper root, lower tiller, and upper tiller) were thoroughly examined. The relative growth performance, metal tolerance, and phytoassessment of heavy metal in roots and tillers of Vetiver grass were examined. Metals in plants were measured using the flame atomic absorption spectrometry (F-AAS) after  digestion. The root-tiller (R/T) ratio, biological concentration factor (BCF), biological accumulation coefficient (BAC), tolerance index (TI), translocation factor (TF), and metal uptake efficacy were used to estimate the potential of metal accumulation and translocation in Vetiver grass. All accumulation of heavy metals were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in both lower and upper roots and tillers of Vetiver grass for Cd + Pb + Cu + Zn + EDTA treatments as compared with the control. The single Zn + EDTA treatment accumulated the highest overall total amount of Zn (8068 ± 407 mg/kg) while the highest accumulation for Cu (1977 ± 293 mg/kg) and Pb (1096 ± 75 mg/kg) were recorded in the mixed Cd + Pb + Cu + Zn + EDTA treatment, respectively. Generally, the overall heavy metal accumulation trends of Vetiver grass were in the order of Zn >>> Cu > Pb >> Cd for all treatments. Furthermore, both upper roots and tillers of Vetiver grass recorded high tendency of accumulation for appreciably greater amounts of all heavy metals, regardless of single and/or mixed metal treatments. Thus, Vetiver grass can be recommended as a potential phytoextractor for all types of heavy metals, whereby its tillers will act as the sink for heavy metal accumulation in the presence of EDTA for all treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552413>Alliance of Genome Resources Portal: unified model organism research platform.</a></h2><p>The Alliance of Genome Resources (Alliance) is a consortium of the major model organism databases and the Gene Ontology that is guided by the vision of facilitating exploration of related genes in human and well-studied model organisms by providing a highly integrated and comprehensive platform that enables researchers to leverage the extensive body of genetic and genomic studies in these organisms.

However, the role of EETs in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis has not been fully understood. In this study, we investigated the protective role of EETs in methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () in mice and the potential mechanisms. We used 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl)urea(TPPU), a soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor, to increase the endogenous EET level in mice. Upon TPPU treatment, the liver steatosis and inflammatory damage were significantly ameliorated in mice with steatohepatitis, paralleled by the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) as well as chemokines (CXCL1, MCP-1). Compared with untreated  mice, mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and inflammation relevant adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) were downregulated, whereas mRNA level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α(PPAR-α) was elevated in TPPU-treated mice. In vitro, 11,12-EET treatment remarkably attenuated free fatty  (FFA)-induced inflammation in HepG2 and THP-1 cells. Further, 11,12-EET inhibited the activation of NF-κB signalling pathway in macrophages from mice with steatohepatitis. Collectively, these results suggest that EETs play a protective role and alleviate the MCD diet-induced steatohepatitis in mice mainly by downregulating activation of NF-κB pathway in macrophages.© 2019 The Foundation for the Scandinavian Journal of Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30864239>Serum C16:1n7/C16:0 ratio as a diagnostic marker for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Accurate diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is clinically important.

Encompassing a spectrum from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis and progressive fibrosis, the disease is rapidly becoming the most common indication for liver transplantation. The molecular pathogenesis of NAFLD remains only partially understood. Development and progression of NAFLD is influenced by genetic and nutritional factors, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, gut microbiome, bile  metabolism and lipid/glucose handling and is closely associated with overweight and obesity. Lifestyle change is the only proven effective treatment for paediatric NAFLD, however this is difficult to achieve in many. Given that moderate or severe fibrosis is already present in 30-50% of children with NAFLD at the time of presentation, progression in CYP may be more rapid, though adequate outcome data do not yet exist in this cohort. CYP with NAFLD are an excellent population in which to study underlying mechanisms and interventions to correct disease progression as they are largely unaffected by other environmental influences such as alcohol and may represent the more severe end of the spectrum in terms of early onset.

We aimed to define such a urinary metabolic signature in a patient cohort with sporadic CCA and investigate whether there were characteristic differences from those in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), metastatic secondary liver cancer, pancreatic cancer and ovarian cancer (OCA).  Spot urine specimens were obtained from 211 subjects in seven participating centers across the UK. Samples were collected from healthy controls and from patients with benign hepatic disease (gallstone, biliary strictures, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction and viral hepatitis) and patients with malignant conditions (HCC, pancreatic cancer, OCA and metastatic cancer in the liver). The spectral metabolite proﬁles were generated using a UPLC-MS detector and data were analyzed using multivariate and univariate statistical analyses.  The greatest class differences were seen between the metabolic proﬁles of disease-free controls compared to individuals with CCA with altered acylcarnitine, bile  and purine levels. Individuals with benign strictures showed comparable urine proﬁles to patients with malignant bile duct lesions. The metabolic signatures of patients with bile duct tumors were distinguishable from patients with hepatocellular and ovarian tumors, but no difference was observed between CCA cases and patients with pancreatic cancer or hepatic secondary metastases.

The pathogenesis of NAFLD, particularly the mechanisms whereby a minority of patients develop a more severe phenotype, is still incompletely understood. In this review we examine the available literature on initial mechanisms of hepatocellular damage and inflammation, deriving from toxic effects of excess lipids. Accumulating data indicate that the total amount of triglycerides stored in the liver cells is not the main determinant of lipotoxicity and that specific lipid classes act as damaging agents. These lipotoxic species affect the cell behavior via multiple mechanisms, including activation of death receptors, endoplasmic reticulum stress, modification of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress. The gut microbiota, which provides signals through the intestine to the liver, is also reported to play a key role in lipotoxicity. Finally, we summarize the most recent lipidomic strategies utilized to explore the liver lipidome and its modifications in the course of NALFD. These include measures of lipid profiles in blood plasma and erythrocyte membranes that can surrogate to some extent lipid investigation in the liver.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The same methodology applied to praziquantel (PZQ)-treated worms revealed sugar metabolism alterations that could be ascribed to the previously reported action of PZQ on serotonin signaling and/or effects on glycolysis. Importantly, our data suggest that compound  and PZQ exert different antischistosomal activities. More studies will be necessary to confirm the generated hypothesis and to progress the development of more potent antischistosomal sclareol derivatives.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30628563>Contribution of the gut microbiota to the regulation of host metabolism and energy balance: a focus on the gut-liver axis.</a></h2><p>This review presents mechanistic studies performed in vitro and in animal models, as well as data obtained in patients that contribute to a better understanding of the impact of nutrients interacting with the gut microbiota on metabolic and behavioural alterations linked to obesity. The gut microbiota composition and function are altered in several pathological conditions including obesity and related diseases i.e. non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). The gut-liver axis is clearly influenced by alterations of the gut barrier that drives inflammation. In addition, recent papers propose that specific metabolites issued from the metabolic cooperation between the gut microbes and host enzymes, modulate inflammation and gene expression in the liver. This review illustrates how dietary intervention with prebiotics or probiotics influences host energy metabolism and inflammation. Indeed, intervention studies are currently underway in obese and NAFLD patients to unravel the relevance of the changes in gut microbiota composition in the management of metabolic and behavioural disorders by nutrients interacting with the gut microbiota. In conclusion, diet is among the main triggers of NAFLD and the gut microbiota is modified accordingly, underlining the importance of the concomitant study of the nutrients and microbial impact on liver health and metabolism, in order to propose innovative, clinically relevant, therapeutic approaches.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30556039>Obeticholic  Modulates Serum Metabolites and Gene Signatures Characteristic of Human  and Attenuates Inflammation and Fibrosis Progression in Ldlr-/-.Leiden Mice.</a></h2><p>Concerns have been raised about whether preclinical models sufficiently mimic molecular disease processes observed in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () patients, bringing into question their translational value in studies of therapeutic interventions in the process of /fibrosis. We investigated the representation of molecular disease patterns characteristic for human  in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed Ldlr-/-.Leiden mice and studied the effects of obeticholic  (OCA) on these disease profiles. Multiplatform serum metabolomic profiles and genome-wide liver transcriptome from HFD-fed Ldlr-/-.Leiden mice were compared with those of  patients. Mice were profiled at the stage of mild (24 weeks HFD) and severe (34 weeks HFD) fibrosis, and after OCA intervention (24-34 weeks; 10 mg/kg/day). Effects of OCA were analyzed histologically, biochemically, by immunohistochemistry, using deuterated water technology ( collagen formation), and by its effect on the human-based transcriptomics and metabolomics signatures. The transcriptomics and metabolomics profile of Ldlr-/-.Leiden mice largely reflected the molecular signature of  patients. OCA modulated the expression of these molecular profiles and quenched specific proinflammatory-profibrotic pathways. OCA attenuated specific facets of cellular inflammation in liver (F4/80-positive cells) and reduced crown-like structures in adipose tissue. OCA reduced  collagen formation and attenuated further progression of liver fibrosis, but did not reduce fibrosis below the level before intervention.  HFD-fed Ldlr-/-.Leiden mice recapitulate molecular transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles of  patients, and these signatures are modulated by OCA. Intervention with OCA in developing fibrosis reduces collagen deposition and  synthesis but does not resolve already manifest fibrosis in the period studied. These data show that human molecular signatures can be used to evaluate the translational character of preclinical models for .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813339>Interesterified Fats Induce Deleterious Effects on Adipose Tissue and Liver in LDLr-KO Mice.</a></h2><p>Interesterified fats are being widely used by the food industry in an attempt to replace trans fatty . The effect of interesterified fats containing palmitic or stearic  on lipid metabolism and inflammatory signaling pathways in adipose and hepatic tissues was evaluated. Male LDLr-KO mice were fed a high-fat diet containing polyunsaturated (PUFA), palmitic (PALM), palmitic interesterified (PALM INTER), stearic (STEAR), or stearic interesterified (STEAR INTER) fats for 16 weeks. The expression of genes and protein levels involved in lipid metabolism and inflammatory processes in liver and white adipose tissue was determined by quantitative RT-PCR and by Western blot, respectively. The infiltration of inflammatory cells in hepatic and adipose tissues was determined by eosin and hematoxylin, while liver collagen content was determined by Sirius Red staining. Both interesterified fats increased liver collagen content and JNK phosphorylation. Additionally, the STEAR INTER group developed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () associated with higher neutrophil infiltration. PALM INTER induced adipose tissue expansion and enlargement of adipocytes. Furthermore, PALM INTER triggered increased IKK phosphorylation and TNFα protein content, conditions associated with the upstream activation of the NFkB signaling pathway.

It is often unclear whether this finding is a non-specific consequence of cirrhosis or indicative of underlying A1ATD (alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency) contributing to the cirrhosis. In this study, explanted livers were retrospectively evaluated for histopathology (including PASD status with confirmatory A1AT immunohistochemistry), and chart review provided etiology of liver failure and general clinical parameters. RT-PCR (real-time PCR) was used to detect A1AT genotype (SERPINA1 S and Z alleles) by melting curve analysis on liver explant tissue from selected cases. Of 196 explanted livers, 21 (11%) had PASD+ globules. PASD+ globules were significantly enriched in patients with a clinical diagnosis of  (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, 47%) compared to other causes such as chronic ethanol use (16%) and chronic hepatitis C virus infection (6.7%) (P 0.001). Immunohistochemistry confirmed all PASD+ globules were A1AT positive, with 20 of 21 cases demonstrating diffuse A1AT staining. In an expanded  cohort, 42% (14/33) of explants had PASD+ globules, and 92% of these PASD+ cases were homozygous (n=1) or heterozygous (n=11) for the SERPINA1 Z allele, corresponding to nearly 40% of all  patients. Overall, the Z allele was present in 10% of all liver explants tested, with 85% of PASD+ cases genotyping homozygous (n=2) or heterozygous (n=20), far in excess of the estimated 2% in the general population. Conclusion: These results indicate PASD+ A1AT globules (with confirmatory genotyping showing at least one Z allele) are commonly observed in , suggesting a synergistic relationship towards liver fibrosis. In addition, the high frequency of SERPINA1 Z alleles in liver transplantation patients supports the utility of pre-transplant genotyping.Copyright © 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31516268>Drug Development for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: Landscape and Challenges.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the leading cause of chronic liver disease in industrialized economies. With no licensed treatment currently available, together with a growing prevalence that parallels global increases in obesity and type 2 diabetes, NAFLD will dominate the landscape of hepatology for the foreseeable future. A multifaceted etiopathogenesis, paucity of reproducible preclinical models that effectively recreate human NAFLD, and lack of robust surrogate trial endpoints have presented major hurdles in drug discovery and development. Smooth collaboration between bench scientists, biotechnology, pharmaceutical industries, and clinicians will be pivotal to target identification, development of effective therapies, biomarker discovery, and ultimately to bring pipeline drugs to market.

While animal models demonstrate similar results on a high-fat diet, none have observed the effects of bariatric surgery on a combined HFHC diet.Mice on a HFHC diet were used to confirm the development of hepatic fibrosis at 8 (n = 15) and 24 (n = 15) weeks. A separate cohort of mice on a HFHC diet for 12 weeks was subjected to either VSG (n = 18) or sham (n = 12) operations and remained on a HFHC diet for an additional 20 weeks. Changes in weight, dyslipidemia, and the development of steatosis and fibrosis were documented. Serum was obtained for bile  analysis by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, while hepatic gene expression by RT-PCR was performed to evaluate intrahepatic lipid metabolism.Hepatic steatosis and fibrosis developed after 8 weeks on the HFHC diet. After VSG, mice demonstrated a sustained decrease in weight with a significant decrease in fibrosis compared to sham mice. Serum total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL were significantly reduced following surgery, while serum bile  were significantly elevated.

Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), is a safe and unexpensive bile  used in the treatment of liver disorders whose mechanism of action is poorly defined. Here we have compared the effects of OCA and UDCA in a mouse model of . In mice exposed to a diet rich in fat/cholesterol and fructose (HFD-F), treatment with OCA or UDCA effectively prevented body weight gain, insulin resistance, as demonstrated by OGTT, and AST plasma levels. After 12 weeks HFD-F mice developed liver microvesicular steatosis, inflammation and mild fibrosis, increased expression of inflammatory (TNFα, IL6, F4/80) and fibrosis (αSma, Col1α1, Tgfβ) markers, reduced liver expression of FXR, dysregulated liver FXR signaling and elevated levels of Tauro-α and β-muricholic  (T-α and βMCA), two FXR antagonists in mice. Both compounds prevented these changes and improved liver histopathology. OCA reduced primary bile  synthesis worsening the T-CA/T-βMCA ratio. UDCA effectively transactivated GPBAR1 in vitro. By RNAseq analysis we found that among over 2400 genes modulated by the HFD-F, only 32 and 60 genes were modulated by OCA and UDCA, with only 3 genes (Dbp, Adh7, Osgin1) being modulated by both agents.

Cirrhosis is the late-stage liver disease and can proceed to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Pharmacological treatment options for liver diseases, cirrhosis, and HCC, are limited, expensive, and not wholly effective. The use of medicinal herbs and functional foods is growing around the world as natural resources of bioactive compounds that would set the basis for the development of new drugs.Plant and food-derived sterols and triterpenoids (TTP) possess antioxidant, metabolic-regulating, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory activities, as well as they are recognized as anticancer agents, suggesting their application strongly as an alternative therapy in some chronic diseases. Thus, it is interesting to review current reports about them as hepatoprotective agents, but also because they structurally resemble cholesterol, sexual hormones, corticosteroids and bile  due to the presence of the steroid nucleus, so they all can share pharmacological properties through activating nuclear and membrane receptors.

NAFLD is characterized by hepatic steatosis and may progress to an inflammatory condition termed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. It became evident in the last years that NAFLD pathophysiology is complex and involves diverse immunological and metabolic pathways. An association between intestinal signals (e.g., derived from the gut microbiota) and the development of obesity and its metabolic consequences such as NAFLD are increasingly recognized. Pre-clinical studies have shown that germ-free mice are protected against obesity and hepatic steatosis. Several human studies from the past years have demonstrated that NAFLD contains a disease-specific gut microbiome signature. Controlled studies propose that certain bacteria with rather pro-inflammatory features such as Proteobacteria or  are dominantly present in these patients. In contrast, rather protective bacteria such as  are decreased in NAFLD patients. Furthermore, various bacterial metabolites and microbiota-generated secondary bile  are involved in NAFLD-associated metabolic dysfunction. Although these findings are exciting, research currently lack evidence that interference at the level of the gut microbiome is beneficial for these diseases. Further preclinical and clinical studies are needed to advance this aspect of NAFLD research and to support the notion that the intestinal microbiota is indeed of major relevance in this disorder.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30745416>RLA8-A New and Highly Effective Quadruple PPAR-// and GPR40 Agonist to Reverse Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis and Fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a very common chronic hepatic disease, with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () as a major and severe subcategory that can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and thereby to a high mortality rate. Currently, there has been no approved drug to treat NAFLD or . The current study has presented RLA8, a novel and balanced quadruple agonist for hepatic lipid metabolism and inflammation-related peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)-// and G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40), as a  drug candidate. The efficacy of RLA8 to treat  was evaluated in vivo using two mouse models induced by methionine/choline-deficient diet or by high-fat diet, respectively. RLA8 was shown to improve serum alanine aminotransferase and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, reduce hepatic free fatty  and triglyceride levels, and alleviate insulin resistance. Cytokine and lipoperoxide analysis revealed that RLA8 could reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. Histochemical and morphologic examination of mouse livers showed that RLA8 could improve pathologic changes such as steatosis, ballooning, collagen fiber, and inflammation. Polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses proved that RLA8 could result in PPARs and GPR40 activation, accompanied by upregulation of the 5'AMP-activated protein kinase-acetyl-CoA carboxylase pathway and inhibition of the expression of lipogenic genes and proteins, which provided more insights into its action mechanisms. In summary, RLA8 has significantly better efficacy to improve -induced liver damage such as steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, and, consequently, it represents a new and highly promising  drug candidate that is worthy of further investigation and development.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30551380>Preventive effect of trans-chalcone on non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: Improvement of hepatic lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () is an inflammatory and progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. However, there are no FDA-approved drugs for this condition. Lipids accumulated in  have a direct role in the progression of this disease. Therefore, this study for the first time explored the preventive effect of trans-chalcone on  through the modulation of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1c, SREBP-2, hepatic fatty  synthesis (FAS) enzyme, proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α, and PPAR-γ2 levels, which are involved in hepatic lipid metabolism. In this study, male rats were randomly divided into three groups (n = 7): Control, received 10% tween 80; , received 10% tween 80 and 10 ml/kg high-fat emulsion (high-fat diet, HFD); and  + TC, received 20 mg/kg trans-chalcone and 10 ml/kg HFD. All treatments were performed by once-daily oral gavage for 6 weeks. Liver and blood samples were collected and serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, as well as hepatic levels of SREBP-1c, SREBP-2, FAS, PPAR-α, and PPAR-γ2, were measured. Moreover, hematoxylin and eosin stained tissues were used for histological analysis. In this study, treatment of HFD-fed rats with trans-chalcone significantly reduced abnormalities in liver histology, serum levels of liver injury markers, liver index, and hepatic levels of SREBP-1c, SREBP-2, FAS, and PPAR-γ2. Furthermore, trans-chalcone significantly increased hepatic PPARα levels in these rats. Therefore, it seems that trans-chalcone protects the liver of HFD-fed rats against  development through reduction of SREBP-1c/ FAS- and PPAR-γ2-related lipogenesis, attenuation of SREBP-2-related cholesterol synthesis, and elevation of PPARα-related fatty  oxidation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We used multilineage 3D spheroids composed by hepatocytes (HepG2) and hepatic stellate cells (LX-2) with a physiological ratio (24:1). HepG2 and LX-2 cells are homozygotes for the  I148M sequence variant, the strongest genetic determinant of NAFLD. We demonstrate that hepatic stellate cells facilitate the compactness of 3D spheroids. Then, we show that the spheroids develop accumulations of fat and collagen upon exposure to free fatty . Finally, this accumulation was rescued by incubating spheroids with liraglutide or elafibranor, drugs that are in clinical trials for the treatment of .

A growing body of evidence supports the therapeutic potential of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (n-3 PUFA), mainly docosahaexenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), on metabolic diseases based on their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Here, we performed a systematic review of clinical trials analyzing the efficacy of n-3 PUFA on both systemic oxidative stress and on NAFLD/ features in adults. As a matter of fact, it remains controversial whether n-3 PUFA are effective to counteract oxidative stress. On the other hand, data suggest that n-3 PUFA supplementation may be effective in the early stages of NAFLD, but not in patients with more severe NAFLD or . Future perspectives and relevant aspects that should be considered when planning new randomized controlled trials are also discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31410156>Role and effective therapeutic target of gut microbiota in NAFLD/.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most prevalent chronic liver disease in the world, is affected by numerous extrinsic and intrinsic factors, including lifestyle, environment, diet, genetic susceptibility, metabolic syndrome and gut microbiota. Accumulating evidence has proven that gut dysbiosis is significantly associated with the development and progression of NAFLD, and several highly variable species in gut microbiota have been identified. The gut microbiota contributes to NAFLD by abnormal regulation of the liver-gut axis, gut microbial components and microbial metabolites, and affects the secretion of bile . Due to the key role of the gut microbiota in NAFLD, it has been regarded as a potential target for the pharmacological and clinical treatment of NAFLD. The present review provides a systematic summary of the characterization of gut microbiota and the significant association between the gut microbiota and NAFLD. The possible mechanisms of how the gut microbiota is involved in promoting the development and progression of NAFLD were also discussed. In addition, the potential therapeutic methods for NAFLD based on the gut microbiota were summarized.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30623143>The GLP-1 Analogs Liraglutide and Semaglutide Reduce Atherosclerosis in ApoE and LDLr Mice by a Mechanism That Includes Inflammatory Pathways.</a></h2><p>The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) liraglutide and semaglutide reduce cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes patients. The mode of action is suggested to occur through modified atherosclerotic progression. In this study, both of the compounds significantly attenuated plaque lesion development in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE) mice and low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient (LDLr) mice. This attenuation was partly independent of weight and cholesterol lowering. In aortic tissue, exposure to a Western diet alters expression of genes in pathways relevant to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, including leukocyte recruitment, leukocyte rolling, adhesion/extravasation, cholesterol metabolism, lipid-mediated signaling, extracellular matrix protein turnover, and plaque hemorrhage. Treatment with semaglutide significantly reversed these changes. These data suggest GLP-1RAs affect atherosclerosis through an anti-inflammatory mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31323923>Sub-Chronic Microcystin-LR Liver Toxicity in Preexisting Diet-Induced Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in Rats.</a></h2><p>Microcystin-LR (MCLR) is a hepatotoxic cyanotoxin reported to cause a phenotype similar to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ().  is a common progressive liver disease that advances in severity due to exogenous stressors such as poor diet and toxicant exposure. Our objective was to determine how sub-chronic MCLR toxicity affects preexisting diet-induced . Sprague-Dawley rats were fed one of three diets for 10 weeks: control, methionine and choline deficient (MCD), or high fat/high cholesterol (HFHC). After six weeks of diet, animals received vehicle, 10 µg/kg, or 30 µg/kg MCLR via intraperitoneal injection every other day for the final 4 weeks. Incidence and severity scoring of histopathology endpoints suggested that MCLR toxicity drove  to a less fatty and more fibrotic state. In general, expression of genes involved in  lipogenesis and fatty  esterification were altered in favor of decreased steatosis. The higher MCLR dose increased expression of genes involved in fibrosis and inflammation in the control and HFHC groups. These data suggest MCLR toxicity in the context of preexisting  may drive the liver to a more severe phenotype that resembles burnt-out .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31388630>Lipoprotein Lipase Up-regulation in Hepatic Stellate Cells Exacerbates Liver Fibrosis in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in Mice.</a></h2><p>Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) plays a central role in incorporating plasma lipids into tissues and regulates lipid metabolism and energy balance in the human body. Conversely, LPL expression is almost absent in normal adult livers. Therefore, its physiological role in the liver remains unknown. We aimed to elucidate the role of LPL in the pathophysiology of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), a hepatic manifestation of obesity. Hepatic stellate cell (HSC)-specific LPL-knockout ( ) mice, LPL-floxed ( ) mice, or double-mutant toll-like receptor 4-deficient ( )  mice were fed a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet for 4 weeks to establish the nonalcoholic fatty liver model or an high-fat/high-cholesterol diet for 24 weeks to establish the  model. Human samples, derived from patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, were also examined. In human and mouse  livers, serum obesity-related factors, such as free fatty , leptin, and interleukin-6, dramatically increased the expression of LPL, specifically in HSCs through signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling, as opposed to that in hepatocytes or hepatic macrophages. In the  mouse model, liver fibrosis was significantly reduced in  mice compared with that in  mice. Nonenzymatic LPL-mediated cholesterol uptake from serum lipoproteins enhanced the accumulation of free cholesterol in HSCs, which amplified TLR4 signaling, resulting in the activation of HSCs and progression of hepatic fibrosis in . : The present study reveals the pathophysiological role of LPL in the liver, and furthermore, clarifies the pathophysiology in which obesity, as a background factor, exacerbates . The LPL-mediated HSC activation pathway could be a promising therapeutic target for treating liver fibrosis in .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30621352>Effects of Hydrogen Sulfide on Carbohydrate Metabolism in Obese Type 2 Diabetic Rats.</a></h2><p>Hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) is involved in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. Inhibition and stimulation of H₂S synthesis has been suggested to be a potential therapeutic approach for type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the effects of long-term sodium hydrosulfide () administration as a H₂S releasing agent on carbohydrate metabolism in type 2 diabetic rats. Type 2 diabetes was established using high fat-low dose streptozotocin. Rats were treated for 9 weeks with intraperitoneal injections of  (0.28, 0.56, 1.6, 2.8, and 5.6 mg/kg). Serum glucose was measured weekly for one month and then at the end of the study. Serum insulin was measured before and after the treatment. At the end of the study, glucose tolerance, pyruvate tolerance and insulin secretion were determined and blood pressure was measured. In diabetic rats  at 1.6⁻5.6 mg/kg increased serum glucose (11%, 28%, and 51%, respectively) and decreased serum insulin, glucose tolerance, pyruvate tolerance and in vivo insulin secretion. In controls,  only at 5.6 mg/kg increased serum glucose and decreased glucose tolerance, pyruvate tolerance and insulin secretion.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter type-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are glucose-lowering agents that improve glucose control while promoting weight loss and lowering serum uric  levels. These agents may exert cardiovascular and renal protection in T2DM patients with established cardiovascular disease. Recent findings from both randomized controlled trials and open-label studies have also shown that SGLT2 inhibitors are able to reduce fatty liver content, as assessed by different imaging techniques, and improve biological markers of NAFLD, especially serum liver enzymes, in patients with T2DM. In addition, there are emerging data to suggest a mechanism beyond the reduction of hyperglycaemia and body weight, and a potential role for the decrease in low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress associated with SGLT2 inhibitor therapy. This positive effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on NAFLD complements their already well-known effects on cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We aimed to investigate the functional role of the miR-34a/SIRT1:AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway in modulating local mitochondrial dysfunction in the skeletal muscle of human and experimental non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Muscle biopsies were obtained from morbid obese NAFLD patients undergoing bariatric surgery. C57BL/6N mice were fed different NAFLD-inducing diets and C2C12 muscle cells incubated with palmitic  (PA) in the presence or absence of an AMPK activator, or upon miR-34a functional modulation. Several muscle miRNAs, including miR-34a, were found increased with human NAFLD progression. Activation of the miR-34a/SIRT1:AMPK pathway, concomitant with impairment in insulin signalling mediators and deregulation of mitochondrial-shaping proteins, was evident in C2C12 cells incubated with PA, as well as in the skeletal muscle of all three diet-induced NAFLD mice models. Functional studies established the association between miR-34a- and PA-induced muscle cell deregulation. Of note, activation of AMPK almost completely prevented miR-34a- and PA-induced cellular stress. In addition, the miR-34a/SIRT1:AMPK pathway and mitochondrial dynamics dysfunction were also found amplified in muscle of human NAFLD. Finally, muscle miR-34a expression and mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) protein levels correlated with hallmarks of NAFLD and disease progression. Our results indicate that activation of the miR-34a/SIRT1:AMPK pathway leads to mitochondrial dynamics dysfunction in skeletal muscle of human and experimental NAFLD, representing an appealing prospective target in metabolic syndrome. KEY MESSAGES: Skeletal muscle microRNAs are modulated during NAFLD progression. Palmitic -induced muscle cell dysfunction occurs, at least in part, through activation of the miR-34a/SIRT1:AMPK pathway. miR-34a/SIRT1:AMPK activation associates with mitochondria dynamics dysfunction in human NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31523414>n-3 PUFAs reduce tumor load and improve survival in a -tumor mouse model.</a></h2><p>With 9.1% of all cancer deaths, hepatocellular carcinoma is the second leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Due to the increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has evolved into a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma development. Herein, we investigated whether a dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) supplementation improves the outcome of progressive NAFLD.Feeding three high-fat diets, differing in n-3 and n-6 PUFA contents and ratios (n-3/n-6: 1:8, 1:1, 5:1), the impact of n-3 PUFAs and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios on NAFLD-related liver fibrosis and tumorigenesis was analyzed in 12- and 20-week-old streptozotocin/high-fat diet (STZ/HFD)-treated mice.Feeding of n-3 PUFA-rich diets (1:1 and 5:1) resulted in increased hepatic n-3 PUFA content and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio with decreased hepatic lipid accumulation. In 20-week-old mice, n-3 PUFA-rich diets alleviated tumor load significantly, with reduced liver/body weight index, tumor size, and tumor number. Finally, these effects were accompanied by a significant improvement of survival of these mice.Herein, we showed that increased n-3 PUFA content and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios lead to improved survival and attenuated tumor progression in STZ/HFD-treated mice. Thus, n-3 PUFAs could be the basis for new therapeutic options against NAFLD-related tumorigenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31514051>Carbon monoxide releasing molecule-A1 improves nonalcoholic steatohepatitis via Nrf2 activation mediated improvement in oxidative stress and mitochondrial function.</a></h2><p>Nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated signaling plays a central role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis of hepatic cells. Carbon monoxide releasing molecule-A1 (CORM-A1) has been reported to stimulate up-regulation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in hepatocytes. However, the role of CORM-A1 in improving lipid metabolism, antioxidant signaling and mitochondrial functions in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () is unknown. In this study, we report that CORM-A1 prevents hepatic steatosis in high fat high fructose (HFHF) diet fed C57BL/6J mice, used as model of . The beneficial effects of CORM-A1 in HFHF fed mice was associated with improved lipid homeostasis, Nrf2 activation, upregulation of antioxidant responsive (ARE) genes and increased ATP production. As, mitochondria are intracellular source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and important sites of lipid metabolism, we further investigated the mechanisms of action of CORM-A1-mediated improvement in mitochondrial function in palmitic  (PA) treated HepG2 cells. Cellular oxidative stress and cell viability were found to be improved in PA + CORM-A1 treated cells via Nrf2 translocation and activation of cytoprotective genes. Furthermore, in PA treated cells, CORM-A1 improved mitochondrial oxidative stress, membrane potential and rescued mitochondrial biogenesis thru upregulation of Drp1, TFAM, PGC-1α and NRF-1 genes. CORM-A1 treatment improved cellular status by lowering glycolytic respiration and maximizing OCR. Improvement in mitochondrial respiration and increment in ATP production in PA + CORM-A1 treated cells further corroborate our findings. In summary, our data demonstrate for the first time that CORM-A1 ameliorates tissue damage in steatotic liver via Nrf2 activation and improved mitochondrial function, thus, suggesting the anti- potential of CORM-A1.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Main causes of NAFLD comprise high caloric intake and a sedentary lifestyle, with high intakes of saturated FAs.The review includes several searches considering the effects of n-3 LCPUFAs in NAFLD in vivo and in vitro models, using the PubMed database from the National Library of Medicine-National Institutes of Health.The LCPUFAs eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5 n-3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (C22:6 n-3, DHA) have a positive effect in diminishing liver steatosis, OS, and the levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and pro-inflammatory cytokines, with improvement of insulin sensitivity and adiponectin levels. The molecular pathways described for n-3 LCPUFAs in cellular and animal models and humans include peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α activation favouring FA oxidation, diminution of lipogenesis due to sterol responsive element binding protein-1c downregulation and inflammation resolution. Besides, nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 activation is elicited by n-3 LCPUFA-derived oxidation products producing direct and indirect antioxidant responses, with concomitant anti-fibrogenic action.The discussed effects of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation support its use in NAFLD, although having a limited value in , a contention that may involve n-3 LCPUFA oxygenated derivatives. Clinical trials establishing optimal dosages, intervention times, type of patients and possible synergies with other natural products are needed in future studies.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p></html>
