A range of countries have opted to completely ban the use of antibiotics in animal feed. The animal production industries are looking for alternative ways to effectively control pathogens while providing the performance benefits previously secured by antibiotics in feed. Here, we present evidence that oregano () could be a potential alternative for pathogen control in the poultry industry. Broiler diets were supplemented with oregano powder (0%, 0.%, 1%, and 2%) for six weeks. The capacity for pathogen control was estimated by microbiota profiling of the jejunum, ileum, and caecum content, and in the faeces, by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The concentrations of short-chain  acids in the caecal content were also measured, as were villus/crypt parameters in the ileum. There were no differences among treatments in weight gain, feed intake, or the concentration of short-chain  acids. The height, width, and the surface area of villi in the ileum were not influenced by oregano addition. However, 1% and 2% of oregano produced a significant increase in the villus height to crypt depth ratio. There were no visible histopathological changes in the  in control and treated groups. Although oregano had no significant effect on overall microbial diversity and gross composition, some specific genera, like ,  and , which include known pathogens, were reduced in relative abundance by oregano treatment. , recognized as a beneficial and probiotic genus, was also suppressed by the oregano treatment.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534788>Associations of visceral fat thickness and anthropometric measurements with non-alcoholic  disease development in male patients mono-infected with human immunodeficiency virus.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) represents the most common form of chronic  disease in mono-infected (without concomitant hepatitis B and/or C virus infection) people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The proper and on time identification of at-risk HIV-positive individuals would be relevant in order to reduce the rate of progression from NAFLD into non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.The aim of this study was to explore visceral fat thickness (VFT) and anthropometric measurements associated with the development of NAFLD in patients mono-infected with HIV and on long-standing combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).Eighty-eight ( = 88) HIV-positive male patients, average age 39.94 ± 9.91 years, and stable on cART, were included in this prospective study. VFT was measured using ultrasonography. Anthropometric measurements included body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (W/H), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), waist and hip circumference (WC, HC). Differences between variables were determined using the chi-square test. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the Youden index were used to determine optimal cut-off values of VFT and hepatic steatosis. The area under the curve (AUC), 95% confidence intervals, sensitivity and specificity are reported for the complete sample. Significance was set at  < 0.05.Patients with steatosis had significantly higher values of BMI, HC, WC, W/H and WHtR. The VFT was higher in patients with steatosis ( < 0.001). Specifically, VFT values above 31.98 mm and age > 38. years correlated with steatosis in HIV-positive patients, namely sensitivity 89%, specificity 72%, AUC 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76-0.93,  < 0.001), with the highest Youden index = 0.61. The sensitivity of the age determinant above this cut-off point was 84%, specificity 73% and AUC 0.83 (95% CI, 0.75-0.92,  < 0.001), with the highest Youden index of 0.57.In the absence of more advanced radiographic and histological tools, simple anthropometric measurements and VFT could assist in the early identification of persons at risk of hepatic steatosis in low- and middle-income regions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630224>Risk profiling using metabolomic characteristics for susceptible individuals of drug-induced  injury caused by Polygonum multiflorum.</a></h1><p>Idiosyncratic drug-induced  injury (IDILI) is a rare but potentially severe adverse drug reaction. To date, identifying individuals at risk for IDILI remains challenging. This is a prospective study, where a nested case-control (1:) design was adopted. For six patients who had abnormalities in  function test after Polygonum multiflorum Thunb. (PM) ingestion (susceptible group), 30 patients with normal  function were matched (tolerant group). Based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, metabolomics analysis was done on serum samples prior to PM ingestion, to screen the differential metabolites and characterize metabolomic profiles of patient serum in the two groups. Multivariate analysis showed that there were remarkable separations between susceptible and tolerant groups. A total of 25 major differential metabolites were screened out, involving glycerophospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism,  acid metabolism, histidine metabolism and aromatic amino acid metabolism. Wherein, the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curves of metabolites PE 22:6, crotonoyl-CoA, 2E-tetradecenoyl-CoA, phenyllactic acid, indole-,6-quinone, phosphoribosyl-ATP were all greater than 0.9. The overall serum metabolic profile comprising of 25 metabolites could clearly distinguish susceptible and tolerant groups. This proof-of-concept study used metabolomics to characterize the metabolic profile of IDILI risk individuals before drug ingestion for the first time. The metabolome characteristics in patient serum before PM ingestion may predict the risk of  injury after PM ingestion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31475703>Benefits of blended oil consumption over other sources of lipids on the cardiovascular system in obese rats.</a></h1><p>High consumption of cooking oils in modern society is believed to be the major cause of cardiovascular disease. The effect of cooking oils depends on their  acid composition. Therefore, it is important to blend different types of oils to improve functional properties. In this study we evaluated the effects of a functional blended oil (BO) composed of a high level of oleic acid (OA) (50.93%) and α-linolenic acid (ALA) (.41%) on cardiovascular health, blood pressure (BP) and body weight (BW) in comparison with lard oil (LO) and peanut oil (PO). Ninety male Wistar rats were divided into three groups and fed for 12 weeks with BO, LO and PO. Each group was divided into low, middle and high fat groups and fed with oil supply ratios of 6.7%, 10.9% and 48.1%, respectively. After the feeding period, the rats were sacrificed, and data were collected and analyzed. Rats treated with BO especially at a high dose (HBO) showed a significantly lower body weight, fat weight,  weight, fat ratio, food intake and energy intake. BO significantly reduced n-6/n-3 levels in plasma,  and adipose tissues as well as serum triglycerides (TGs) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) but contrarily increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Furthermore, HBO treatments decreased mRNA expression of lipid anabolism-related genes, lipid inflammatory-related genes, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and increased lipid catabolism-related genes as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma mRNA (PPARγ mRNA). In terms of antioxidant enzymes, BO treatment has increased the activity of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) by lowering malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tissues. Moreover, BO supplementation showed a significant lowering effect on the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), blood pressure (BP), atherosclerosis index (AI) and heart rate (HR). These findings highlight that the new blend of canola oil, corn oil, olive oil, peanut oil and sunflower oil with a low n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio of 6 : 1 could prevent and control cardiovascular disease (CVD).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31485221>Compound C Protects Mice from HFD-Induced Obesity and Nonalcoholic  Disease.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of compound C on an in vivo mouse model of high-fat diet- (HFD-) induced obesity and hepatosteatosis.C57BL/6 mice were fed with a standard diet ( = ) for 16 weeks and then injected saline once a day for 4 weeks as the normal chow group. Mice ( = 10) were fed with HFD for 16 weeks to induce obesity and hepatosteatosis and then divided into two groups: HFD + vehicle group injected with the vehicle solution (saline) and HFD + compound C group injected with compound C in saline ( mg/kg i.p., once a day) for 4 weeks.  histology was observed. The expression levels of genes related to lipid metabolism and proinflammation in  tissue were examined. NLRP3 inflammasome expression in  tissue was detected by the western blot assay. HepG2 cells were pretreated with compound C and/or AICAR for 1 h and then treated with palmitic acid (PA) for 3 h. The cells were collected, and mRNA levels were determined.There was a significant reduction in body-weight gain and daily food intake in the HFD + compound C group compared with the HFD + vehicle group ( < 0.05). The glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) showed that compound C alleviated insulin resistance. Histology analysis showed a significant reduction of hepatic steatosis by compound C. Compound C also significantly decreased  acid synthesis genes, while increased  acid oxidation genes. Furthermore, compound C significantly reduced the expression of proinflammatory markers and NLRP3 inflammasome ( < 0.05). Compound C enhanced mRNA levels of SOD1, SOD2, catalase, GPx1, and GPx4 and reduced the p-AMPK/AMPK ratio, which were stimulated by palmitic acid (PA). The effect was enhanced by AICAR.Our data suggest that compound C is a potent NAFLD suppressor and an attractive therapeutic target for hepatic steatosis and related metabolic disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31470068>The risk of incident extrahepatic cancers is higher in non-alcoholic  disease than obesity - A longitudinal cohort study.</a></h1><p>Cancer is a major cause of death in patients with non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). Obesity is a risk factor for cancers; however, the role of NAFLD in this association is unknown. We investigated the effect of NAFLD versus obesity on incident cancers.We identified all incident cases of NAFLD in a US population between 1997-2016. Individuals with NAFLD were matched by age and sex to referent individuals from the same population (1:3) on the index diagnosis date. We ascertained the incidence of cancer after index date until death, loss to follow-up or study end. NAFLD and cancer were defined using a code-based algorithm with high validity and tested by medical record review. The association between NAFLD or obesity and cancer risk was examined using Poisson regression.A total of 4,722 individuals with NAFLD (median age 54, 46% male) and 14,441 age- and sex-matched referent individuals were followed for a median of 8 (range 1-21) years, during which 2,224 incident cancers occurred. NAFLD was associated with 90% higher risk of malignancy: incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.9 (95% CI 1.3-2.7). The highest risk increase was noted in  cancer, IRR = 2.8 (95% CI 1.6-.1), followed by uterine IRR = 2.3 (95% CI 1.4-4.1), stomach IRR = 2.3 (95% CI 1.3-4.1), pancreas IRR = 2.0 (95% CI 1.2-3.3) and colon cancer IRR = 1.8 (95% CI 1.1-2.8). In reference to non-obese controls, NAFLD was associated with a higher risk of incident cancers (IRR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.-2.9), while obesity alone was not (IRR = 1.0, 95% CI 0.8-1.4).NAFLD was associated with increased cancer risk, particularity of gastrointestinal types. In the absence of NAFLD, the association between obesity and cancer risk is small, suggesting that NAFLD may be a mediator of the obesity-cancer association.We studied the incidence of malignancies in a community cohort of adults with non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) in reference to age- and sex-matched adults without NAFLD. After 21 years of longitudinal follow-up, NAFLD was associated with a nearly 2-fold increase in the risk of developing cancers, predominantly of the , gastrointestinal tract and uterus. The association with increased cancer risk was stronger in NAFLD than obesity.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the . Published by Elsevier B.V.

Administration of probiotics and prebiotics has been proposed as a convenient and effective treatment. Our study aims to evaluate the therapeutic benefits of  N1115 (N1115) and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) by examining the histopathogenesis and underlying molecular events of NAFLD.An NAFLD mouse model was established by feeding C57BL/6 mice with a high-fat diet (HFD). N1115, FOS and synbiotics were administered for 16 weeks.N1115, FOS and synbiotics alleviated HFD-induced hepatic steato-sis and release of tumor necrosis factor-α, and slowed the progression of cirrhosis. Compared to the HFD group, these dietary supplements reduced serum total triglyceride and cholesterol, and appeared to decrease the fasting blood glucose and insulin. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and real-time PCR showed that the regimens could overcome insulin resistance. These findings were associated with the transcriptional repression of inflammatory factors such as lipopolysaccharides, Toll-like receptor 4 and nuclear factor-κB. Lastly, N1115, FOS, and synbiotics improved the intestinal barrier functions and histologic integrity. This was accompanied by the restoration of the p38 MAPK pathway and in-creased expression of the tight junction components occludin-1 and claudin-1.N1115, FOS and synbiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Our data support the translation of these agents into clinical evaluation in human subjects with NAFLD and/or associated risk factors.Copyright: © 2019 Termedia & Banach.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659873>Muscle Insulin Resistance in Youth with Obesity and Normoglycemia is Associated with Altered Fat Metabolism.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to phenotype and compare adipose, hepatic, and muscle insulin sensitivity (IS) in a diet- and physical activity-controlled cohort of normoglycemic youth with obesity with that of participants without obesity (controls) to distinguish early metabolic abnormalities in pediatric obesity.Thirty-eight participants (17 in the control group [BMI < 85th percentile] and 21 youth with obesity [BMI ≥ 95th percentile]; age: 12-21 years; 76% female; Tanner stage 4-; sedentary) were enrolled. Tissue-specific IS was measured using a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess suppression of endogenous glucose release and lipolysis by insulin. Intramyocellular lipid content was assessed by  H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hepatic fat fraction (HFF) and visceral fat were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with obesity had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral fat (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular lipid content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003). Mitochondria postexercise response was not different. In participants with obesity, muscle IS inversely correlated with HFF (r = 0.700, P = 0.002) and suppressed free  acid concentrations (r = -0.65, P = 0.003).Inactive normoglycemic youth with obesity had decreased muscle, adipose, and hepatic IS. Free  acids and  fat were inversely associated with muscle IS, which argues for lipid-targeted interventions.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675427>Effect of Metabolic Traits on the Risk of Cirrhosis and Hepatocellular Cancer in Non-alcoholic  Disease.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is now the most common  condition. Predicting its progression could help clinicians manage and potentially prevent complications. We evaluated the independent and joint effects of metabolic traits on the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients with NAFLD. We assembled a retrospective cohort of patients with NAFLD diagnosed at 130 facilities in the Veterans Administration between 1/1/2004 and 12/31/2008 with follow-up through 12/31/2015. We performed competing risk, adjusted cause-specific Cox models to evaluate the effects of metabolic traits (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity) as additive or combined indicators on time to develop cirrhosis or HCC or a composite endpoint of both. Of the 271,906 patients, 22,794 developed cirrhosis, and 253 developed HCC during a mean of 9 years follow up. At baseline, the mean BMI was 31.6 (SD, .6), 28.7% had diabetes, 70.3% hypertension, and 62.3% had dyslipidemia with substantial overlap among the these traits. The risk of progression was the lowest in patients with only one or no metabolic trait. There was a stepwise increase in risk with each additional metabolic trait. Compared to patients with no metabolic trait, patients with both hypertension and dyslipidemia had 1.8-fold higher risk of progression to cirrhosis/HCC (hazard ratio (HR) =1.8, 95% CI=1.59-2.06); the risk was 2.6-fold higher in patients with diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension (HR=2.6, 95% CI=2.3,2.9). These associations were stronger for HCC. Diabetes had the strongest association with HCC in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Each additional metabolic trait increased the risk of cirrhosis and HCC in patients with NAFLD. Diabetes conferred the highest risk of progression to HCC. Diabetic patients with co-existing hypertension and obesity may be important targets for secondary prevention.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of  Diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554294>Relationship between Muscle Mass/Strength and Hepatic Fat Content in Post-Menopausal Women.</a></h1><p>: Recent studies have shown that low skeletal muscle mass can contribute to non-alcoholic  disease through insulin resistance. However, the association between muscle mass/strength and hepatic fat content remains unclear in postmenopausal women. : In this study, we assessed the associations between muscle mass/strength and various severities of non-alcoholic  disease. Using single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, 96 postmenopausal women between the ages of 50 and 65 were divided into four groups (G0-G3) by hepatic fat content: G0 (hepatic fat content <%,  = 20), G1 (% ≤ hepatic fat content < 10%,  = 27), G2 (10% ≤ hepatic fat content < 25%,  = 31), and G3 (hepatic fat content ≥25%,  = 18). Muscle mass indexes were estimated as skeletal muscle index (SMI)% (total lean mass/weight × 100) and appendicular skeletal muscular mass index (ASM)% (appendicular lean mass/weight × 100) by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Maximal isometric voluntary contraction of the handgrip, elbow flexors, and knee extensors was measured using an adjustable dynamometer chair. Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and follicle-stimulating hormones were assessed in venous blood samples. : The results showed negative correlations between hepatic fat content and SMI% (r = -0.42,  < 0.001), ASM% (r = -0.29,  = 0.005), maximal voluntary force of grip (r = -0.22,  = 0.037), and knee extensors (r = -0.22,  = 0.032). : These significant correlations almost remained unchanged even after controlling for insulin resistance. In conclusion, negative correlations exist between muscle mass/strength and the progressed severity of non-alcoholic  disease among post-menopausal women, and the correlations are independent of insulin resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602526>Hepatic FATP5 expression is associated with histological progression and loss of hepatic fat in NAFLD patients.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are characterized by the accumulation of excess hepatic fat. However, in the progression from NASH to cirrhosis, hepatic fat is often lost. Our aim was to elucidate the mechanism underlying hepatic fat loss during NASH progression. biopsies were performed at The University of Tokyo Hospital between November 2011 and March 2016 on 146 patients with NAFLD and 14 patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis who were not being treated with any diabetes or dyslipidemia drugs. Among them, 70 patients underwent  biopsy after an overnight fast, and 90 patients were biopsied  h after an oral glucose tolerance test. Expression differences in genes encoding several  acid metabolism-related factors were examined and correlated with hepatic histological changes based on NAFLD activity scores. Prospective patient follow-up continued until June 2018.The level of  acid transport protein  (FATP5), which is associated with free  acid intake, was significantly and inversely correlated with features of histological progression, including ballooning and fibrosis. This was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. Transcript levels of genes encoding  acid metabolism-related proteins were comparable between NASH with severe fibrosis and cryptogenic cirrhosis. Furthermore, a prospective cohort study demonstrated that low FATP5 expression was the most significant risk factor for hepatic fat loss.Decreased hepatic FATP5 expression in NAFLD is linked to histological progression, and may be associated with hepatic fat loss during NASH progression to cirrhosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651803>Childhood Obesity: A Risk Factor for Non-alcoholic  Disease in Adolescence.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), defined as fat accumulation >% in hepatocytes, may progress to fibrosis or cirrhosis later in life.

In addition, elastography was performed on all participants with ultrasound evidence of NAFLD.9.7% of the participants presented findings compatible with NAFLD. After 2 years of age, obesity significantly and progressively increased the probability of NAFLD occurrence in adolescence. Obesity at  years of age was associated with the highest OR for NAFLD, reaching values of 8.91 (95% CI 3.03-16.11). Among participants with NAFLD, those with altered  elasticity (≥7 Kpa) had greater weight, BMI z-score, waist and hip circumference and altered  enzymes (p < 0.05).The risk of developing NAFLD in adolescence increases progressively with early obesity starting at age 2 years.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31497752>Dynamic interactions of ABHD5 with PNPLA3 regulate triacylglycerol metabolism in brown adipocytes.</a></h1><p>Patatin-Like Phospholipase Domain Containing 2 (PNPLA2)/Adipose Triglyceride Lipase (ATGL) and PNPLA3/Adiponutrin are close paralogs that appear to have opposite functions on triacylglycerol (TAG) mobilization and storage. PNPLA2/ATGL is a major triglyceride lipase in adipose tissue and , whereas a common human variant of PNPLA3, I148M, greatly increases risk of hepatosteatosis. Nonetheless, the function of PNPLA3 and the mechanism by which the I148M variant promotes TAG accumulation are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that PNPLA3 strongly interacts with α/β hydrolase domain-containing  (ABHD5/CGI-58), an essential co-activator of PNPLA2/ATGL. Molecular imaging experiments demonstrate that PNPLA3 effectively competes with PNPLA2/ATGL for ABHD5, and that PNPLA3 I148M is more effective in this regard. Inducible overexpression of PNPLA3 I148M greatly suppressed PNPLA2/ATGL-dependent lipolysis and triggered massive TAG accumulation in brown adipocytes, and these effects were dependent on ABHD5. The interaction of PNPLA3 and ABHD5 can be regulated by  acid supplementation and synthetic ABHD5 ligands, raising the possibility that this interaction might be targeted for treatment of  disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633048>Limited applicability of cathepsin D for the diagnosis and monitoring of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h1><p>To date, there are limited data on the applicability of cathepsin D for the diagnosis and monitoring of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).This study included patients with biopsy-proven non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) diagnosed between November 2012 and October 2015. Serum cathepsin D levels were measured using the CatD enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (USCN Life Science, Wuhan, China) using stored samples collected on the same day of the  biopsy procedure. The performance of cathepsin D in the diagnosis and monitoring of NASH was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic analysis.Data for 216  biopsies and 34 healthy controls were analyzed. The mean cathepsin D level was not significantly different between NAFLD patients and controls; between NASH and non-NASH patients; and across the different steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning grades. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of cathepsin D for the diagnosis of NAFLD and NASH was 0.62 and 0.52, respectively. The AUROC of cathepsin D for the diagnosis of the different steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning grades ranged from 0.51 to 0.58. Of the 216  biopsies, 152 were paired  biopsies from 76 patients who had a repeat  biopsy after 48 weeks. There was no significant change in the cathepsin D level at follow-up compared to baseline in patients who had histological improvement or worsening for steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning grades. Cathepsin D was poor for predicting improvement or worsening of steatosis and hepatocyte ballooning, with AUROC ranging from 0.47 to 0.54. It was fair for predicting worsening (AUROC 0.73) but poor for predicting improvement (AUROC 0.54) of lobular inflammation.Cathepsin D was a poor biomarker for the diagnosis and monitoring of NASH in our cohort of Asian patients, somewhat inconsistent with previous observations in Caucasian patients. Further studies in different cohorts are needed to verify our observation.© 2019 The Authors.

Though effective in reducing psychoses, acute olanzapine treatment causes rapid increases in blood glucose that are believed to be mediated by increases in  glucose output, skeletal muscle insulin resistance, and beta cell dysfunction. Further, the acute lipidemic response to olanzapine has been largely unexplored. While females have been reported to be more susceptible to olanzapine-induced weight gain, there is little known about the impact of sex on the acute response to SGAs. The purpose of this study was to determine if the acute effects of SGAs on glucose and lipid metabolism display a sexually dimorphic response in C57BL/6 J mice and examine potential mechanisms mediating this effect. Age matched male and female C57BL/6 J mice were treated with olanzapine ( mg/ kg, IP) or vehicle control and blood glucose was measured at baseline, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min post-treatment and tissues and serum harvested. These experiments were repeated, and mice underwent an insulin (0. IU/kg) or pyruvate tolerance test (2 g/kg) following 60 min of olanzapine treatment. Females were protected against olanzapine-induced increases in blood glucose and pyruvate intolerance compared to male mice, and this occurred despite the development of severe insulin resistance. In male mice olanzapine increased the glucagon:insulin ratio whereas in females this ratio was reduced. When challenged with exogenous glucagon (1 mg/kg IP), females were less responsive than males. Male and female mice displayed similar increases in whole body  acid oxidation, serum  acids and  triglyceride accumulation. Our findings provide evidence that while there are no apparent sex differences in the lipid metabolism response to olanzapine, that females are protected from acute olanzapine-induced excursions in blood glucose.

Oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress have been recognized as key mechanisms in non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis. Whether Orai1 facilitates ER stress by oxidative stress remains unknown. The rat model of NAFLD was constructed by feeding high-fat diet (HFD). BRL-3A cells were treated with NEFAs, Orai1inhibtor BTP2, NFκB inhibitor wogonin, or small interfering Orai (siOrai) 1, respectively. The content of intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA), indicating oxidative stress, was measured by a spectrophotometer. ER stress major proteins PERK, IRE1, ATF6, CHOP, and GRP78 were quantified using Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses. For the intracellular location of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Orai1 were measured by Western blot and immunofluorescence, and cytosolic Ca was measured by flow cytometry. As we expected, the  of rats with NAFLD showed lipid droplets in HE and Oil Red O. The decreased GSH and increased MDA were found in rats fed with HFD. ER stress major proteins PERK, IRE1, ATF6, GRP78, and CHOP were significantly increased in the HFD group. In BRL-3A cells, GSH content dramatically decreased from 1 h, MDA content dramatically increased from 3 h, and expression levels of ER stress significantly increased from 3 h by NEFA treatment. Furthermore, cytosolic Ca increased from 0. h by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells. It indicated that NEFAs increased cytosolic Ca to induce oxidative stress, thus ER stress. The content of oxidative stress and ER stress proteins showed the same trends by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells. These effects were reversed by the Orai1 inhibitor BTP2 and the NFκB inhibitor wogonin. Moreover, siOrai1 abrogated NEFAs' influence in BRL-3A cells. Last, ROS was found by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells, and NEFA treatment enhanced the nuclear localization of NF-κB p65 and ORAI1. It was considered that high NEFAs increased cytosolic Ca and enhanced NFκB-dependent SOCE and its moiety protein Orai1 to decrease GSH and thus induced oxidative stress at earlier stages and furthermore tempted ER stress in the pathologic progress of NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Li, Zou, Guo, Zhang, Xia, Zhang, Yang and Xu.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645727>Somatic mutations and clonal dynamics in healthy and cirrhotic human .</a></h1><p>The most common causes of chronic  disease are excess alcohol intake, viral hepatitis and non-alcoholic  disease, with the clinical spectrum ranging in severity from hepatic inflammation to cirrhosis,  failure or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The genome of HCC exhibits diverse mutational signatures, resulting in recurrent mutations across more than 30 cancer genes. Stem cells from normal livers have a low mutational burden and limited diversity of signatures, which suggests that the complexity of HCC arises during the progression to chronic  disease and subsequent malignant transformation. Here, by sequencing whole genomes of 482 microdissections of 100-500 hepatocytes from  normal and 9 cirrhotic livers, we show that cirrhotic  has a higher mutational burden than normal . Although rare in normal hepatocytes, structural variants, including chromothripsis, were prominent in cirrhosis. Driver mutations, such as point mutations and structural variants, affected 1-% of clones. Clonal expansions of millimetres in diameter occurred in cirrhosis, with clones sequestered by the bands of fibrosis that surround regenerative nodules. Some mutational signatures were universal and equally active in both non-malignant hepatocytes and HCCs; some were substantially more active in HCCs than chronic  disease; and others-arising from exogenous exposures-were present in a subset of patients. The activity of exogenous signatures between adjacent cirrhotic nodules varied by up to tenfold within each patient, as a result of clone-specific and microenvironmental forces. Synchronous HCCs exhibited the same mutational signatures as background cirrhotic , but with higher burden. Somatic mutations chronicle the exposures, toxicity, regeneration and clonal structure of  tissue as it progresses from health to disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555572>Role of Soluble Adiponectin Receptor 2 in Non-Alcoholic  Disease in Children.</a></h1><p>The incidence of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) in children is gradually increasing. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of serum adiponectin and soluble adiponectin receptor 2 (soluble Adipo R2) levels for the diagnosis of  disease in obese and overweight children.The study included 51 obese and overweight children between the ages of 6 and 18 years diagnosed with NAFLD using ultrasonography and 20 children without  disease. Patients whose alanine transaminase level was two times higher than normal (≥80 U/L) were included in the non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) group.NASH was observed in 11 (21.6%) of the patients with NAFLD. The incidence of obesity was higher in patients with NASH (80% and 45%, =0.021). While the adiponectin levels were similar in patients with NAFLD and those without, they were below the normal level in the whole study group. Adiponectin and soluble Adipo R2 levels of patients with NASH were lower than those in patients without NASH; however, this difference was not statistically significant (=0.064 and =0.463). Soluble Adipo R2 levels in obese patients with NAFLD were higher than those in obese children without NAFLD (<0.001).Soluble adiponectin receptor 2 level is a noninvasive marker that can be used for the diagnosis of NAFLD in obese children.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31598919>A Nationwide Study of Inpatient Admissions, Mortality, and Costs for Patients with Cirrhosis from 2005 to 2015 in the USA.</a></h1><p> cirrhosis is a substantial health burden in the USA, but population-based data regarding the trend and medical expenditure are limited and outdated. We investigated the trends of inpatient admissions, costs, and inpatient mortality from 2005 to 2015 among cirrhotic patients.A retrospective analysis was conducted using the National Inpatient Sample database. We adjusted the costs to 2015 US dollars using a 3% inflation rate. National estimates of admissions were determined using discharge weights.We identified 1,627,348 admissions in cirrhotic patients between 2005 and 2015. From 2005 to 2015, the number of weighted admissions in cirrhotic patients almost doubled (from 505,032 to 961,650) and the total annual hospitalization cost in this population increased three times (from .8 to 16.3 billion US dollars). Notably, admission rates varied by  disease etiology, decreasing from 2005 to 2015 among patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis while increasing (almost tripled) among patients with nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD)-related cirrhosis. The annual inpatient mortality rate per 1000 admissions overall decreased from 63.8 to 58.2 between 2005 and 2015 except for NAFLD (27.2 to 35.8) (P < 0.001).Rates and costs of admissions in cirrhotic patients have increased substantially between 2005 and 2015 in the USA, but varied by  disease etiology, with decreasing rate for HCV-associated cirrhosis and for HBV-associated cirrhosis but increasing for NAFLD-associated cirrhosis. Inpatient mortality also increased by one-third for NAFLD, while it decreased for other diseases.

In 2013, a new  transplant program was established at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. Here, we describe our experience with the first 150 transplants over a 4.-year period. This study is a review of 147 patients who underwent the first 150  transplants at the University of Mississippi Medical Center between March , 2013, and January 4, 2018. There were no exclusion criteria for this study. Donor, recipient, and outcome variables were analyzed. Recipients were 46% female and 74% white. Age at the time of transplant was 57 [IQR 49-63]. BMI at transplant was 30 [IQR 25-35]. Thirty per cent of transplants were for alcoholic cirrhosis, 25% non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, 24% hepatitis C, and 12% cholestatic. Mean model for end-stage  disease (MELD) at the time of transplant was 20 [95% confidence interval 19-21] and MELD-Na was 22 [95% confidence interval 20-23]. One-year patient- and graft survival were 89% and 87%, respectively, which were as expected based on Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient reports after risk adjustment.

Here, we examined the diagnostic performance of the fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) for detecting (or excluding) advanced fibrosis in patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD.The diagnostic performance of each non-invasive test according to previously identified cutoff points indicating low and high risk for advanced fibrosis was determined in 463 patients with NAFLD. Patients who scored <1.3 and >2.67 on the FIB-4 were considered at low and high risk for advanced fibrosis, respectively. Patients who scored <-1.455 and >0.676 on the NFS were considered at low and high risk for advanced fibrosis, respectively.Eighty-one patients (17.%) had biopsy-proven advanced fibrosis (F≥3). The published FIB-4 cutoff values for low and high risk were able to exclude advanced fibrosis with negative predictive values (NPVs) of 0.907 and 0.843 and specificities of 74% and 97%, respectively. The published NFS cutoff values for low and high risk were able to exclude advanced fibrosis with NPVs of 0.913 and 0.842 and specificities of 63% and 96%, respectively. If biopsies were performed in only patients with a FIB-4 above the low cutoff point (≥1.3), 67.1% could be avoided. Conversely, if biopsies were performed in only patients with an NFS above the low cutoff point (≥-1.455), 57.0% could be avoided.The main clinical utility of the FIB-4 and NFS in patients with NAFLD lies in the ability to exclude, not identify, advanced fibrosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540584>Influence of Daytime LED Light Exposure on Circadian Regulatory Dynamics of Metabolism and Physiology in Mice.</a></h1><p>Light is a potent biologic force that profoundly influences circadian, neuroendocrine, and neurobehavioral regulation in animals. Previously we examined the effects of light-phase exposure of rats to white light-emitting diodes (LED), which emit more light in the blue-appearing portion of the visible spectrum (465 to 485 nm) than do broad-spectrum cool white fluorescent (CWF) light, on the nighttime melatonin amplitude and circadian regulation of metabolism and physiology. In the current studies, we tested the hypothesis that exposure to blue-enriched LED light at day (bLAD), compared with CWF, promotes the circadian regulation of neuroendocrine, metabolic, and physiologic parameters that are associated with optimizing homeostatic regulation of health and wellbeing in 3 mouse strains commonly used in biomedical research (C3H [melatonin-producing], C57BL/6, and BALB/c [melatonin-non-producing]). Compared with male and female mice housed for 12 wk under 12:12-h light:dark (LD) cycles in CWF light, C3H mice in bLAD evinced 6-fold higher peak plasma melatonin levels at the middark phase; in addition, high melatonin levels were prolonged 2 to 3 h into the light phase. C57BL/6 and BALB/c strains did not produce nighttime pineal melatonin. Body growth rates; dietary and water intakes; circadian rhythms of arterial blood corticosterone, insulin, leptin, glucose, and lactic acid; pO₂ and pCO₂;  acids; and metabolic indicators (cAMP, DNA, tissue DNA H-thymidine incorporation, fat content) in major organ systems were significantly lower and activation of major metabolic signaling pathways (mTOR, GSK3β, and SIRT1) in skeletal muscle and  were higher only in C3H mice in bLAD compared with CWF. These data show that exposure of C3H mice to bLAD compared with CWF has a marked positive effect on the circadian regulation of neuroendocrine, metabolic, and physiologic parameters associated with the promotion of animal health and wellbeing that may influence scientific outcomes. The absence of enhancement in amelatonic strains suggests hyperproduction of nighttime melatonin may be a key component of the physiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515740>Significant decrease in Faecalibacterium among gut microbiota in nonalcoholic  disease: a large BMI- and sex-matched population study.</a></h1><p>Compositional changes of the gut microbiota are known to occur in patients with nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD); however, the changes did not corroborate between the studies. We evaluated the gut microbiota between NAFLD and non-NAFLD participants, excluding the influence of obesity and sex in this study involving a large number of participants.In total, 1148 adults participated in the health survey. NAFLD was defined as  by ultrasonography in the absence of other causes of steatosis. To exclude the influence of obesity and sex, NAFLD participants were matched to non-NAFLD participants based on BMI and sex. The relative abundance of each bacterial taxa in fecal samples was calculated using 16S ribosomal RNA amplification and was compared between NAFLD and non-NAFLD participants.There were 205 (23.%) participants defined as having NAFLD. Before matching, there were significant differences in the relative abundance of more than 1% in two classes, two orders, three families, and three genera including Faecalibacterium between NAFLD and non-NAFLD participants. After matching, 153 matched pairs were obtained. In terms of the relative abundance of more than 1%, the relative abundance of two taxa, including the family Ruminococcaceae and the genus Faecalibacterium, was significantly lower in NAFLD participants than in non-NAFLD participants (p = 0.016 and p = 0.018).The significant decrease in Faecalibacterium is a remarkable characteristic on BMI- and sex-matched analysis in NAFLD participants in a large study population.

However, little is known about the relationship between postsurgical robust parathyroid hormone (PTH) reduction and perisurgical renal tubular cell viability. Post-PTX kidney function is still a crucial issue for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and tertiary hyperparathyroidism after kidney transplantation (THPT).As a clinical study, we examined data from 52 consecutive patients (45 with PHPT, 7 with THPT) who underwent PTX in our center between 2015 and 2017 to identify post-PTX kidney injury. Their clinical data, including urinary -type  acid-binding protein (L-FABP), a tubular biomarker for acute kidney injury (AKI), were obtained from patient charts. An absolute change in serum creatinine level of 0.3 mg/dL (26. µmol/L) on Day 2 after PTX defines AKI. Post-PTX calcium supplement dose adjustment was performed to strictly maintain serum calcium at the lower half of the normal range. To mimic post-PTX-related kidney status, a unique parathyroidectomized rat model was produced as follows: 13-week-old rats underwent thyroparathyroidectomy (TPTX) and/or /6 subtotal nephrectomy (NX). Indicated TPTX rats were given continuous infusion of a physiological level of 1-34 PTH using a subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipump. Immunofluorescence analyses were performed by polyclonal antibodies against PTH receptor (PTHR) and a possible key modulator of kidney injury, Klotho.Patients' estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) did not have any clinically relevant change (62. ± 22.0 versus 59.4 ± 21.9 mL/min/1.73 m, NS), whereas serum calcium (2.7 ± 0.18 versus 2.2 ± 0.16 mmol/L, P < 0.0001) and phosphorus levels (0.87 ± 0.19 versus 1.1 ± 0.23 mmol/L, P < 0.0001) were normalized and PTH decreased robustly (181 ± 99.1 versus 23.7 ± 16.8 pg/mL, P < 0.0001) after successful PTX. However, six patients who met postsurgical AKI criteria had lower eGFR and greater L-FABP than those without AKI. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis revealed eGFR <35 mL/min/1.73 m had 83% accuracy. Strikingly, L-FABP >9.8 µg/g creatinine had 100% accuracy in predicting post-PTX-related AKI. Rat kidney PTHR expression was lower in TPTX. PTH infusion (+PTH) restored tubular PTHR expression in rats that underwent TPTX. Rats with TPTX, +PTH and /6 NX had decreased PTHR expression compared with those without /6 NX. /6 NX partially cancelled tubular PTHR upregulation driven by +PTH. Tubular Klotho was modestly expressed in normal rat kidneys, whereas enhanced patchy tubular expression was identified in /6 NX rat kidneys. This Klotho and expression and localization pattern was absolutely canceled in TPTX, suggesting that PTH indirectly modulated the Klotho expression pattern. TPTX +PTH recovered tubular Klotho expression and even triggered diffusely abundant Klotho expression. /6 NX decreased viable tubular cells and eventually downregulated tubular Klotho expression and localization.Preexisting tubular damage is a potential risk factor for AKI after PTX although, overall patients with hyperparathyroidism are expected to keep favorable kidney function after PTX. Patients with elevated tubular cell biomarker levels may suffer post-PTX kidney impairment even though calcium supplement is meticulously adjusted after PTX. Our unique experimental rat model suggests that blunted tubular PTH/PTHR signaling may damage tubular cell viability and deteriorate kidney function through a Klotho-linked pathway.© The Author(s) 2019.

In skeletal muscle, 3-hydroxy-isobutyrate produced by valine promotes skeletal muscle  acid uptake, resulting in the accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipids in skeletal muscle, causing skeletal muscle insulin resistance. In the , branched-chain α-keto acids decompose in large amounts, promote hepatic gluconeogenesis, and lead to the accumulation of multiple acylcarnitines, which damages the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle, resulting in the accumulation of incomplete oxidation products, oxidative stress in mitochondria, and hepatic insulin resistance. In adipose tissue, the expression of branched-chain amino acid catabolic enzymes (branched-chain amino acid transaminase, branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase) is reduced, resulting in an increased level of plasma branched-chain amino acids, thereby causing massive decomposition of branched-chain amino acids in tissues such as skeletal muscle and , and inducing insulin resistance. However, branched-chain amino acids, as a common nutritional supplement for athletes, do not induce insulin resistance. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that exercise can enhance the mitochondrial oxidative potential of branched-chain amino acids, alleviate or even eliminate the accumulation of branched-chain amino acid catabolic intermediates, and promotes branched-chain amino acids catabolism into beta-aminoisobutyric acid, increasing plasma beta-aminoisobutyric acid concentration, improving insulin resistance. This article reveals the mechanism of BCAA-induced insulin resistance and the relationship between exercise and BCAAs metabolism, adds a guarantee for the use of BCAAs, and provides a new explanation for the occurrence of diabetes and how exercise improves diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474792>High prevalence of non-alcoholic  disease in patients with inflammatory bowel disease receiving anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study evaluated the prevalence of NAFLD and the associated risk factors among IBD patients who received anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy.Adult IBD patients receiving anti-TNF therapy (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab) were enrolled. Hepatic steatosis was assessed by abdominal ultrasound. Patients with a history of excessive alcohol or recent steroid use were excluded. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed.Eighty patients, 55% male, mean age 42±15 years, were enrolled. The sonographic prevalence of NAFLD was 54% (43/80), significantly higher than the general prevalence in the US adult population (30%) (P<0.0001). NAFLD patients had a significantly higher proportion of males, as well as greater body weight and body mass index, compared to non-NAFLD. The Crohns disease activity index (CDAI) was significantly higher among patients with NAFLD. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that a higher CDAI was independently associated with NAFLD, with an odds ratio of 1.6 (95% confidence interval 1.05-2.44; P=0.03).The presence of IBD is strongly associated with NAFLD. We identified a high prevalence of NAFLD among IBD patients receiving anti-TNF. CDAI was independently associated with hepatic steatosis.

It is often related to metabolic syndrome, presenting an increased risk of advanced  disease and cardiovascular-related death. In some etiologies of chronic  disease, thrombocytopenia has been associated not only with advanced stages of fibrosis but also with autoimmune disease. In NAFLD, however, its prevalence and related factors are still unknown. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of thrombocytopenia in NAFLD patients without cirrhosis and to investigate its related risk factors.This was a retrospective study carried out in two tertiary hospitals in the South and Southeast regions of Brazil. Patients diagnosed with NAFLD by  biopsy were included. Those with other causes of  disease and/or cirrhosis were excluded. For analysis, patients were divided into two groups, with and without thrombocytopenia. Data was analyzed using a significance level of %.441 non-cirrhotic patients with NAFLD (evaluated by  biopsy) were included in the study. The prevalence of thrombocytopenia was 3.2% (14/441 patients). In the comparative analysis between groups, thrombocytopenia was associated with male sex (p=0.007) and level of hemoglobin (p=0.023).Thrombocytopenia is an infrequent event in NAFLD patients without cirrhosis and is related with male sex and higher hemoglobin levels.Copyright © 2019 Fundación Clínica Médica Sur, A.C.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of perinatal exposure to BPA on NAFLD and its mechanisms. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats had access to drinking water containing 1 or 10 μg/ml BPA from gestational day 6 to post-natal day 21. For  weeks after weaning, offspring drank normal water without BPA. Body weight, lipid profile and the expression of genes or proteins involved in mTOR mediated lipid metabolism and autophagy, as well as inflammatory response were investigated in the 8-wk-old offspring of different genders. The results showed that body weight was increased only in females, however, males, and females from dams treated with BPA had significantly excess visceral adipose tissue, which was consistent with adipocyte hypertrophy. Elevated TG levels and up-regulation of lipogenic genes or proteins in , such as sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), and  acid synthase (FAS) were consistent with increased  lipid droplets in offspring exposed to BPA. Compared with controls, the protein levels of InsR, p-IRS-1, IRS-1, TSC1, and TSC2 were decreased, p-PI3K, p-Akt (S473), p-Akt (T308), p-mTOR, and mTOR were increased, and the impaired autophagic degradation was evidenced by increased protein levels of p62, although the levels of p-ULK1, Beclin1, and LC3B proteins were increased in  of BPA-exposed offspring. The levels of TLR4 and NF-κB proteins were also significantly increased, and ERα protein was significantly decreased in BPA-exposed offspring. Our findings indicate that perinatal exposure to BPA causes the development of NAFLD in both female and male offspring, which is associated with up-regulation of lipogenic genes, dysregulated autophagy and activated inflammatory response involving the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and TLR4/NF-κB pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673534>Endogenously increased n-3 PUFA levels in fat-1 transgenic mice do not protect from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic  disease worldwide, ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis. Possible reasons for the NAFLD epidemic in industrialized countries are the high intake of pro-inflammatory n-6 polyunsaturated  acids (n-6 PUFAs) and low consumption of healthy n-3 PUFAs. Due to their anti-inflammatory properties, n-3 PUFAs may have the potential to alleviate chronic  disease. Herein, we examined the therapeutic effect of increased n-3 PUFA tissue levels in fat-1 transgenic mice on progressive NASH.Disease was induced in mice by streptozotocin and high fat diet (STZ/HFD) resulting in NASH. NAFLD in 6 and 8 weeks old wild type and fat-1 transgenic STZ/HFD treated mice was analyzed. Unlike all other mammals, fat-1 transgenic mice ubiquitously express an n-3  acid desaturase, which converts n-6 to n-3 PUFAs, leading to increased n-3 and decreased n-6 PUFA tissue contents. damage, NAFLD activity score (NAS), hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation were significantly reduced in fat-1 transgenic STZ/HFD treated mice in the early (6 weeks) but not late (8 weeks) phase of NASH. Simultaneously, mRNA expression of genes involved in  acid uptake and storage ( and , respectively) was significantly down-regulated in 6 week old but not 8 week old fat-1 transgenic STZ/HFD treated mice.Endogenously elevated n-3 PUFA levels in fat-1 transgenic mice transiently delay the onset of STZ/HFD induced NASH but failed to efficiently protect from NASH development.2019 Hepatobiliary Surgery and Nutrition.

It is mainly produced by recombinant microorganisms (Candida famata, Bacillus subtilis and Ashbya gossypii). The availability of genetically modified organism (GMO)-free riboflavin, obligatory in European organic agriculture, is a major issue. Besides, requirements for organic livestock might differ from conventional production because other genotypes and feed formulations are used. The effects of a fermentation suspension with a high native content of riboflavin produced with unmodified A. gossypii by fermentation were investigated at graded dosages as an alternative to conventional (GMO-based) riboflavin in slow-growing broilers on performance traits and health and welfare indicators. In 2 runs with 800 animals each, Ranger Gold™ broilers were fed with 4 dietary treatments. For starter diets (day 1 to 18), treatments included a basal diet (1) without any riboflavin supplementation (negative control, N-C), (2) with conventional riboflavin supplementation (Cuxavit B2 80% riboflavin) at 9.6 mg/kg (positive control, P-C), (3) with riboflavin supplementation from the alternative source at 3. mg/kg (A-low) and (4) with riboflavin supplementation from the alternative source at 9.6 mg/kg (A-high). For the finisher diet (day 29 until slaughtering), P-C and A-high were supplemented with 8.0 mg/kg and A-low with 3. mg/kg. Diets were formulated according to organic regulations. Animals were kept in floor pens with 20 chickens per pen. Weekly, BW, feed and water consumption were recorded. Every second week, animal-based health and welfare indicators (feather score and footpad dermatitis) were scored. Slaughter traits were assessed for five males and females per pen at 62/63 days of age. Final body weight of A-high differed from N-C and A-low, but not from P-C. From week 2 until six years of age, A-high had a higher daily weight gain when compared to all other groups. With 74.4%, dressing percentage was higher in A-high compared with all other groups (73.3%). Breast percentage of A-low was lower than that of both control groups but did not differ from A-high. The highest frequency of  scores indicating  syndrome was found in P-C, followed by N-C and A-low. Feather scores did not respond to treatment; the highest frequency of mild footpad dermatitis was observed in A-high, however at a low prevalence. In conclusion, the tested fermentation suspension with a high native content of riboflavin derived from fermentation of A. gossypii can be used at levels of commercial recommendations as alternative to riboflavin produced from GMO in broiler feeding. Further studies must verify whether riboflavin can be reduced without inducing riboflavin deficiency in slow-growing broilers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601203>Prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in non-menopausal and postmenopausal inpatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in China.</a></h1><p>To investigate the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and assess the 10-year risk of CVD in non-menopausal and postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).A total of 569 patients with T2DM at a Chinese tertiary hospital were investigated using the Framingham Risk Score (FRS).

The 10-year risk of CVD was (1.6 ± 1.%) and tended to increase along with age (F = 27.726, P <  0.001). For all subjects (n = 569), multiple linear regression analysis showed that menopause (β = 0.275, P <  0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (β = 0.212, P <  0.001), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (β = 0.093, P = 0.018) and waist-to-hip-ratio (β = - 0.078, P = 0.047) were risk factors of 10-year risk of CVD, which may explain the variance of 14.3%. In the postmenopausal group (n = 397), LDL-C (β = 0.227, P <  0.001), FPG (β = 0.139, P = 0.003) and time since menopause (β = 0.230, P <  0.001) were found to be associated with CVD, which may explain the variance of 14.6%.The incidence of dyslipidmia, hypertension, overweight or obesity and NAFLD is high. The level of control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and blood lipids was found to be extremely low and the treatment status was not ideal. Besides menopause, LDL-C, FPG and time since menopause were found to be independent risk factors for the 10-year risk of CVD. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on comprehensive control of multiple risk factors, such as plasma glucose, blood pressure and serum lipid.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611038>Effects of tesamorelin on non-alcoholic  disease in HIV: a randomised, double-blind, multicentre trial.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a substantial cause of comorbidity in people with HIV and there are no proven pharmacological treatments for the disease in this population. We assessed the effects of tesamorelin on  fat and histology in people with HIV and NAFLD.This randomised, double-blind, multicentre study with identical placebo as a comparator was done in a hospital and a medical research centre in the USA. People with HIV infection and a hepatic fat fraction (HFF) of % or more by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy were eligible. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either tesamorelin 2 mg once daily or placebo once daily for 12 months, followed by a 6-month open-label phase during which all participants received tesamorelin 2 mg daily. The randomisation list was prepared by the study statistician using a permuted block algorithm within each stratum with randomly varying block sizes. The primary endpoint was change in HFF between baseline and 12 months. The primary safety endpoint was glucose. Analysis was by intention to treat using all available data. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number .61 patients were enrolled between Aug 20, 2015, and Jan 16, 2019, of whom 30 received tesamorelin and 30 received placebo. Patients receiving tesamorelin had a greater reduction of HFF than did patients receiving placebo, with an absolute effect size of -4·1% (95% CI -7·6 to -0·7, p=0·018), corresponding to a -37% (95% CI -67 to -7, p=0·016) relative reduction from baseline. After 12 months, 35% of individuals receiving tesamorelin and 4% receiving placebo had a HFF of less than % (p=0·0069). Changes in fasting glucose and glycated haemoglobin were not different between groups at 12 months. Individuals in the tesamorelin group experienced more localised injection site complaints than those in the placebo group, though none were judged to be serious.Tesamorelin might be beneficial in people with HIV and NAFLD.

One hundred and twenty ROSS 308 broiler chickens were randomly divided into six groups (10 replications, 2 birds per replication). Group I received an uncontaminated and unsupplemented diet, diets of groups II to VI were contaminated with OTA at 172 µg and 200 µg/kg for the starter and grower period, respectively. Furthermore, diets of groups III, IV and V were supplemented with vitamin E at 100, 200 and 100 mg, respectively, and to diets of groups V and VI additionally 100 and 2200 mg PP was added, respectively. Supplementation with PP and vitamin E had no significant effects on the growth performance, dressing percentage or carcass trait parameters of broiler chickens. In chickens exposed to stress, dietary supplementation with vitamin E and/or PP improved the total antioxidant status ( ≤ 0.05), enhanced the blood activity of antioxidant enzymes ( ≤ 0.01) and increased the concentrations of non-enzymatic antioxidants ( ≤ 0.01) in the  and breast muscles. Regardless of the administered antioxidants, chickens fed diets contaminated with OTA were characterised by lower dressing percentage ( ≤ 0.01), a higher proportion of the  in the carcass ( ≤ 0.01), lower carcass fat content ( ≤ 0.01), and longer small intestines ( ≤ 0.01) and caeca ( ≤ 0.01). Dietary supplementation with PP improved the water-holding capacity of meat ( ≤ 0.01). The breast muscles of chickens fed diets supplemented with PP and vitamin E were characterised by higher ( ≤ 0.05) concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid (C). It was concluded that PP can be an insufficient component of diets for broiler chickens to improve growth performance and mitigate the negative effects of high dose of OTA in diets.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547563>Metabolomics of Aurantio-Obtusin-Induced Hepatotoxicity in Rats for Discovery of Potential Biomarkers.</a></h1><p>Aurantio-obtusin is an anthraquinone derived from  (cassiae semen). It is also used as a tool and a detection index for the identification of cassiae semen, as stipulated by the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. Anthraquinones, the main components in cassiae semen, have been reported to show hepatotoxicity. This study investigates the hepatotoxicity of aurantio-obtusin in male Sprague-Dawley rats. We randomly divided the animals into a blank control group and treated three test groups with different doses of aurantio-obtusin: Low dose (4 mg/kg), medium dose (40 mg/kg), and high dose (200 mg/kg). Each group was treated with aurantio-obtusin for 28 days, whereas the control group was administered an equal volume of 0.% carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (CMC-Na) aqueous solution. Subsequently, we conducted biochemical, hematological, and pathological investigations and determined the weight of different organs. We used serum metabolomics to identify possible biomarkers related to hepatotoxicity. The low-dose group showed no significant  injury, whereas the medium- and high-dose groups manifested obvious  injury. Compared with the control group, the test groups showed an increase in alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase levels. The  organ coefficient also significantly increased. Additionally, we found significant changes in the hematological indices. Metabolomics analysis showed that aurantio-obtusin induced 28 endogenous markers related to  injury. Our data indicate that aurantio-obtusin induces hepatotoxicity in rat  in a dose-dependent manner and is mediated by pathways involving bile acids,  acids, amino acids, and energy metabolism. In particular, changes in bile acid content during treatment with therapeutic agents containing aurantio-obtusin deserve increased attention.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31580982>Novel inhibitors of leukocyte transendothelial migration.</a></h1><p>Leukocyte transendothelial migration is one of the most important step in launching an inflammatory immune response and chronic inflammation can lead to devastating diseases. Leukocyte migration inhibitors are considered as promising and potentially effective therapeutic agents to treat inflammatory and auto-immune disorders. In this study, based on previous trioxotetrahydropyrimidin based integrin inhibitors that suboptimally blocked leukocyte adhesion, twelve molecules with a modified scaffold were designed, synthesized, and tested in vitro for their capacity to block the transendothelial migration of immune cells. One of the molecules, namely, methyl 4-((2-(tert-butyl)-6-((2,4,6-trioxotetrahydropyrimidin-(2H)-ylidene) methyl) phenoxy) methyl) benzoate, (compound 12), completely blocked leukocyte transendothelial migration, without any toxic effects on immune or endothelial cells (IC = 2.4 µM). In vivo, compound 12 exhibited significant therapeutic effects in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)/Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis,  disease, and rheumatoid arthritis models. A detailed acute and chronic toxicity profile of the lead compound in vivo did not reveal any toxic effects. Such a type of molecule might therefore provide a unique starting point for designing a novel class of leukocyte transmigration blocking agents with broad therapeutic applications in inflammatory and auto-immune pathologies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In our previous study, we showed that alcohol-induced increase in serum ghrelin levels impair insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells. The consequent reduction in the circulating insulin levels promote adipose-derived  acid mobilization to ultimately contribute to hepatic steatosis. In this study, we determined whether inhibition of ghrelin activity in chronic alcohol-fed rats could improve hepatic lipid homeostasis at the pancreas-adipose- axis. Adult Wistar rats were fed Lieber-DeCarli control or an ethanol liquid diet for 7 weeks. At 6 weeks, a subset of rats in each group were injected with either saline or ghrelin receptor antagonist, [d-Lys-3] GHRP-6 (DLys; 9 mg/kg body weight) for  days and all rats were sacrificed 2 days later. DLys treatment of ethanol rats improved pancreatic insulin secretion, normalized serum insulin levels, and the adipose lipid metabolism, as evidenced by the decreased serum free  acids (FFA). DLys treatment of ethanol rats also significantly decreased the circulating FFA uptake, de novo hepatic  acid synthesis ultimately attenuating alcoholic steatosis. To summarize, inhibition of ghrelin activity reduced alcoholic steatosis by improving insulin secretion, normalizing serum insulin levels, inhibiting adipose lipolysis, and preventing  acid uptake and synthesis in the . Our studies provided new insights on the important role of ghrelin in modulating the pancreas-adipose-, and promoting adipocyte lipolysis and hepatic steatosis. The findings offer a therapeutic approach of not only preventing alcoholic  injury but also treating it.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31527322>Association of Fetuin-B with Subclinical Atherosclerosis in Obese Chinese Adults.</a></h1><p>We aimed to explore the independent associations of serum Fetuin-B and common genetic variants in FETUB locus with subclinical atherosclerosis.A cross-sectional study of 1,140 obese adults, who underwent serum Fetuin-B testing, hepatic ultrasonography scanning, genotyping on four tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FETUB locus and atherosclerosis detection, was conducted in Xiamen, China.Increasing tertiles of brachial ankle pulse wave velocity (ba-PWV) were significantly associated with higher prevalence of nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) (48.8%, 61.%, and 70.% for tertiles of 1-3, respectively, p＜0.001) and serum Fetuin-B (3.85±1.39, 4.09±1.40, and 4.27±1.46 µg/ml, p=0.047). Multivariable linear regression analyses with adjustment for potential confounding factors, even NAFLD per se, showed that serum Fetuin-B were significantly and positively associated with ba-PWV, with standardized regression coefficients (β) ranging from 0.055 to 0.075 (all p-values ＜0.05) in different models. However, the significant relationship between serum Fetuin-B and ba-PWV disappeared with further adjustment for insulin resistance. Serum Fetuin-B was not significantly associated with ankle-brachial index (ABI). All genotypes of the four tested FETUB tagging SNPs were not significantly associated with either ba-PWV or ABI with adjustment for potential confounding factors.Serum Fetuin-B was positively associated with ba-PWV and may link  fat accumulation to subclinical atherosclerosis via insulin resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652711>Ubiquinol Supplementation Alters Exercise Induced Fatigue by Increasing Lipid Utilization in Mice.</a></h1><p>Ubiquinol (QH), a reduced form of coenzyme Q10, is a lipid antioxidant that is hydro-soluble and is commonly formulated in commercial supplements. Ubiquinol has been increasingly reported to exert antioxidant functions, in addition to its role in the cell energy-producing system of mitochondria and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. The aim of this study was to assess the potential beneficial effects of QH on anti-fatigue and ergogenic functions following physiological challenge. Forty 8-week-old male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were divided into four groups ( = 10 for each group): Group 1 (vehicle control or oil only); Group 2 (1X QH dose or 102. mg/kg); Group 3 (2X QH dose or 205 mg/kg); Group 4 (6X QH dose or 615 mg/kg). Anti-fatigue activity and exercise performance were studied using the forelimb grip strength experiment and exhaustive weight-loaded swimming time, and levels of serum lactate, ammonia, glucose, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), creatine kinase (CK), and free  acids (FFA) after an acute exercise challenge. The forelimb grip strength and exhaustive weight-loaded swimming time of the QH-6X group were significantly higher than those of the other groups. QH supplementation dose-dependently reduced serum lactate, ammonia, and CK levels and increased the FFA concentration after acute exercise. In addition, QH increased the  and muscle glycogen content, an important energy source during exercise. Therefore, the results suggest that QH formulation is a safe dietary supplement for amelioration of fatigue and for promoting exercise performance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31538216>Cardiac abnormalities in patients with nonalcoholic  disease : Insights from auxiliary examinations.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common forms of chronic  disease in developed countries and is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome. It is defined as steatosis in over % of hepatocytes. The disease spectrum of NAFLD ranges from simple  to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis,  fibrosis, even hepatic cirrhosis. The disease affects various extra-hepatic systems such as the cardiovascular system and urinary system. Heart-related disease is identified as the leading cause of mortality in NAFLD patients rather than -related disease. In this review, we summarize the cardiac abnormalities (structural, functional, arrhythmic cardiac complications etc.) seen in NAFLD patients with the assistance of auxiliary examinations, such as electrocardiography, echocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging etc. In addition, the epidemiology of NAFLD and how NAFLD affects the myocardium are also discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31579921>Dietary Garcinol Attenuates Hepatic Pyruvate and Triglyceride Accumulation by Inhibiting P300/CBP-Associated Factor in Mid-to-Late Pregnant Rats.</a></h1><p>Increased hepatic glycolysis and lipogenesis are characteristic of pregnancy.The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism of garcinol on the amelioration of hepatic pyruvate and triglyceride (TG) accumulation in mid-to-late pregnant rats.Forty Sprague-Dawley pregnant rats (aged 9 wk, n = 10/diet) were fed a basal diet (control) or that diet plus garcinol at 100 ppm (Low Gar), 300 ppm (Mid Gar), or 500 ppm (High Gar) for 14 d. The livers were processed for Western blotting analyses and measuring enzymatic activity and pyruvate and TG concentrations. Hepatocytes from other pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were transfected with P300/CBP associating factor (PCAF) short interfering (si)RNAs; hepatocytes from nonpregnant Sprague-Dawley rats with overexpression of PCAF were treated with garcinol ( μM). The activity and acetylation of upstream stimulatory factor (USF-1) and glycolytic enzymes were analyzed.Dietary garcinol significantly decreased (P < 0.05) concentrations of hepatic and plasma TG (27.1-45.8%) and total cholesterol (25.3-49.%), plasma free  acids (24.4-37.8%), and hepatic pyruvate (31.-43.%) and lactate (33.4-65.7%) in mid-to-late pregnant rats.

However, the exact mechanisms of NAFLD pathophysiology remain poorly understood including its progression to the more severe nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). New advances for early detection and monitoring of NASH progression are limited due to the lack of specific blood biomarkers, thus requiring invasive  biopsies for histopathology. Herein, multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-tandem mass spectrometry (MSI-CE-MS/MS) is validated as a high throughput, robust, and quantitative platform for targeted analysis of a panel of 16 serum γ-glutamyl dipeptides from a cohort of NASH adult patients from Japan (median age = 53 years, median BMI = 27 kg/m,  = 116). Multiplexed separations based on MSI-CE-MS/MS enable the design of unique data workflows that rely on customizable serial sample injection formats for accurate determination of γ-glutamyl dipeptides with quality control. Also, the introduction of a liquid coolant device to the capillary outlet improves long-term migration time stability in CE. Unsupervised pattern recognition methods revealed two distinctive NASH subgroups based on their contrasting γ-glutamyl dipeptide status despite patients having similar clinical phenotypes and NASH activity scores (median NAS ≈ 6.0). There was an inverse correlation between serum γ-glutamyl dipeptide concentrations and γ-glutamyltransferease (GGT) enzyme activity ( = -0.46;  = 2. × 10), which was indicative of a low-risk ( = 64) as compared to a high-risk ( = 52) patient subgroup with impaired glutathione salvage pathway and likely poor clinical prognosis. Our findings highlight the key role of defects in the γ-glutamyl cycle for differentiation of NASH patients, which may enable better risk assessment of long-term survivorship as a complement to standard  enzyme screens and histopathology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501870>Adaptive radiation of the flukes of the family Fasciolidae inferred from genome-wide comparisons of key species.</a></h1><p> and intestinal flukes of the family Fasciolidae cause zoonotic food-borne infections that impact both agriculture and human health throughout the world. Their evolutionary history and the genetic basis underlying their phenotypic and ecological diversity is not well understood. To close that knowledge gap, we compared the whole genomes of Fasciola hepatica, Fasciola gigantica and Fasciolopsis buski and determined that the split between Fasciolopsis and Fasciola took place ∼90 Ma in the late Cretaceous period, and that between 65-50 Ma an intermediate host switch and a shift from intestinal to hepatic habitats occurred in the Fasciola lineage. The rapid climatic and ecological changes occurring during this period may have contributed to the adaptive radiation of these flukes. Expansion of cathepsins, -acid binding proteins, protein disulfide-isomerases, and molecular chaperones in the genus Fasciola highlights the significance of excretory-secretory proteins in these -dwelling flukes. Fa. hepatica and Fa. gigantica diverged ∼ Ma near the Miocene-Pliocene boundary that coincides with reduced faunal exchange between Africa and Eurasia. Severe decrease in the effective population size around ∼10 Ka in Fasciola is consistent with a founder effect associated with its recent global spread through ruminant domestication. G-protein-coupled receptors may have key roles in adaptation of physiology and behavior to new ecological niches. This study has provided novel insights about the genome evolution of these important pathogens, has generated genomic resources to enable development of improved interventions and diagnosis, and has laid a solid foundation for genomic epidemiology to trace drug resistance and to aid surveillance.© The Author(s) 2019.

The ultrasound  indicator (US-FLI) evaluates ultrasound (US) features to identify stages of  disease. We hypothesized that US features could be independent predictors of NASH and that the US-FLI differentiates steatosis from NASH in the average obese population.A retrospective analysis of 208 patients with normal (n = 14), steatotic (n = 89), and NASH (n = 105) livers was performed. /biliary disease and a history of alcohol intake were excluded. Ultrasound metrics included -kidney contrast, posterior attenuation, vessel blurring, difficulty visualizing the gallbladder wall, difficulty visualizing the diaphragm, and areas of focal  sparing. A statistical comparison of the 3 groups as well as fibrosis stage I and II/III NASH groups was performed. Logistic regression identified independent predictors of NASH.Gallbladder wall visualization and vessel blurring were different between the steatosis and NASH groups (P ≤ .01). Gallbladder wall visualization was specific for NASH (89%), and vessel blurring was sensitive for NASH (93%). A US-FLI score of 4 or lower suggested the absence of NASH (negative predictive value, 88%; sensitivity, 91%). Logistic regression revealed vessel blurring as the only US predictor of NASH (P ≤ .01). However, the area under the curve (0.649) showed poor performance in differentiating steatosis from NASH when the US-FLI score was  or higher.Our data suggest that the US-FLI may differentiate steatosis from NASH in the average obese population. Vessel blurring and poor gallbladder wall visualization were the most important metrics. Identification of NASH was enhanced by including the US-FLI score with vessel blurring.Published 2019.

Considering the important role of dietary intakes in development of NAFLD, we aimed to determine possible association of unhealthy foods (fast foods, soft drinks, sweet and salty snacks) consumption with elevated levels of aminotransferases.This cross-sectional study was conducted within the framework of sixth phase of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (2014-2017), on 187 adult men and 249 adult women (19-70 y). Usual intakes of unhealthy foods (kcal/week) were measured using a validated semi-quantitative 147-items food frequency questionnaire. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of elevated aminotransferases in each tertile of energy-dense unhealthy foods.Mean age of participants was 44.44 ± 15.09 years, 43% of participants were men. Higher consumption of fast foods (> 11.39% kcal/week) was associated with elevated ALT to AST ratio (OR: 3.27; 95% CI: 1.90-.63) and elevated ALT (OR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.57-4.76). Also, each 1 SD increased energy intakes from fast foods was related to increased chance of having elevated ALT and ALT to AST ratio by 35% (OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.08-1.68, OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.10-1.66, respectively).

However, its effect on the risk of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between nut consumption and NAFLD risk.We conducted a retrospective case-control study including 534 patients diagnosed with NAFLD and 534 controls matched by sex and age (± years) from the Affiliated Nanping First Hospital of Fujian Medical University in China.Information on dietary intake was collected using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire and nut consumption was calculated. Nut consumption was categorised using quartiles based on the distribution of daily nut intake of the controls. Binary logistic regression models were used to estimate ORs and the 95% CIs for the association between nut consumption and NAFLD risk.After adjusting for potential confounding variables, nut consumption was not associated with NAFLD risk in the overall sample. When the fully adjusted model was stratified by sex, a significant inverse association was found between high nut consumption and NAFLD only among the men in the highest quartile (OR=0.43; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.71;   0.01). The inverse association of nut consumption with NAFLD risk in men remained significant after controlling for other known or suspected risk factors for NAFLD.Diets with a higher intake of nuts may be associated with a decreased risk of NAFLD, particularly in men.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

In the present study, we hypothesized that the increased milk production associated with rbIL-8 treatment is a consequence of increased postpartum dry matter intake (DMI) and orchestrated homeorhetic changes that prioritize milk production. Cows were enrolled into 1 of 3 treatment groups: those assigned to the control group (CTR; n = 70) received an intrauterine (IU) administration of 500 mL of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) solution and 1 mL of DPBS solution intravenously (IV; jugular vein), those assigned to the rbIL-8 IV group (rbIL8-IV, n = 70) received an IV injection of 167 μg of rbIL-8 and 500 mL of DPBS solution IU, and cows assigned to the rbIL-8 IU group (rbIL8-IU, n = 70) received an IU administration with 1,195 μg of rbIL-8 diluted in 499. mL of DPBS solution and 1 mL of DPBS solution IV. Animals were housed in a tiestall from calving to 30 d in milk (DIM) to measure DMI. Blood samples were collected daily from calving to 7 DIM and weekly until 28 DIM. Insulin resistance was evaluated using an intravenous glucose tolerance test and intravenous insulin challenge test (IVICT) in a subgroup of cows (n = 20/treatment) at 10 and 11 DIM, respectively. Additionally,  biopsy samples were taken at 14 DIM from the same subgroup of cows to measure triglyceride levels and cell proliferation and apoptosis. Cows treated with rbIL8-IU produced more milk (CTR = 36.9 ± 1.; rbIL8-IU = 38. ± 1.; rbIL8-IV = 36.6 ± 1. kg/d), energy-corrected milk (CTR = 42.9 ± 0.9; rbIL8-IU = 46.1 ± 0.8; rbIL8-IV = 43.7 ± 0.9 kg/d), and fat-corrected milk (CTR = 44.3 ± 0.9; rbIL8-IU = 47.8 ± 0.9; rbIL8-IV = 45.2 ± 0.9 kg/d) yields when compared with CTR cows, and no differences were observed between rbIL8-IV and CTR cows. The administration of rbIL8-IU significantly increased DMI compared with CTR (CTR = 18.8 ± 0.3; rbIL8-IU = 19.9 ± 0.3; rbIL8-IV = 19.3 ± 0.3 kg/d). Recombinant bIL-8 treatment did not affect glucose, insulin, or  acids (i.e., IVICT only) concentrations or their area under the curve in response to an intravenous glucose tolerance test and IVICT when compared with CTR. Moreover, rbIL-8 treatment administered IU or IV increased  triglyceride levels. Additionally, cows treated with rbIL8-IU tended to have lower odds of developing hyperketonemia (odds ratio = 0.46, 95% confidence interval: 0.19 to 1.10), lower odds of clinical ketosis and displaced abomasum combined (odds ratio = 0.17, 95% confidence interval: 0.03 to 0.89), and lower odds of diseases combined (odds ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.21 to 0.86) when compared with CTR. We conclude that the administration of rbIL8-IU increases DMI, milk production, fat-corrected milk, and energy-corrected milk while improving overall health during the postpartum period. This study supports the use of rbIL-8 administered IU shortly after calving to improve health and production responses in lactating cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Adipocyte  acid binding protein (A-FABP) plays a key role in  acid uptake and intracellular transport. The objective of the present study was to identify and characterise the  gene in Xupu goose. 2. The full-length  of goose  gene was cloned from the  tissue using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of  ends (RACE). The distribution of the goose  in different tissues was determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). 3. The results showed that the full-length  sequence of goose  was 657 bp, containing a '-UTR of 52 bp, a 3'-UTR of 206 bp and an open reading frame (ORF) of 399 bp, which encoded a polypeptide of 132 amino acids (AA). 4. The AA sequence of goose  showed 76.52%, 75.00%, 93.18% and 99.24% identities with previously described homologues from humans (), mouse (), chicken (), and duck (), respectively, and phylogenetic analysis revealed a close relationship among them. The transcript of Xupu goose  was ubiquitously expressed in all tested tissues, and showed a high-level expression in abdominal fat, sebum and . . A significant positive correlation was identified between A-FABP  abundance in the three adipose tissues and  weight, ratio of  to body weight, TG content, and VLDL concentration in the plasma of Xupu goose. A significant negative correlation was observed between the  level of A-FABP and HDL concentration in the plasma of Xupu goose. 6.

This study intended to analyze the effects of hazelnut oil supplementation on the serum lipid profile and nonalcoholic  disease in hamsters fed a high-cholesterol (HC) diet. : Hamsters were fed a basic diet (control group) and an HC diet (HC group) for 16 weeks ( = 10 in each group). Hamsters were fed an HC diet for four weeks to induce hyperlipidemia and were then fed an HC diet enriched with % (low-dose HC + HO group;  = 10) and 10% HO (high-dose HC + HO group;  = 10) for 12 weeks. Serum lipid levels, hepatic changes (including steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis), and hepatic prooxidant-antioxidant status (malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione S-transferase (GST)) were evaluated after the treatment period. : Hamsters in the control group showed normal serum lipid profiles, normal  function, and moderate glycogen storage without hepatic steatosis. Hamsters in the HC group showed severe hyperlipidemia, severe hepatic steatosis, and moderate steatohepatitis (mononuclear cell and neutrophil infiltration, oval cell hyperplasia, and fibrosis). Compared to the HC group, both the low-dose and the high-dose HC + HO groups showed a significant reduction of hyperlipidemia (serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C levels)) and improved  function (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)). Additionally, compared to the HC group, intrahepatic triglyceride accumulation (IHTC) was significantly higher in the HC + HO group, while the incidence of steatohepatitis was significantly lower. The intake of the HC diet was associated with a higher level of lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde, MDA) and a lower concentration of hepatic antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GPx, and GST), and all these factors were partially improved in the low-dose and high-dose HC + HO groups.  Our findings indicate that the intake of HO reduced serum hyperlipidemia and oxidative stress and ameliorated the progression of nonalcoholic  disease in hamsters fed a high-cholesterol diet.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540903>Empagliflozin Effectively Lowers  Fat Content in Well-Controlled Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase 4, Placebo-Controlled Trial.</a></h1><p>To evaluate whether the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin (EMPA) reduces  fat content (LFC) in recent-onset and metabolically well-controlled type 2 diabetes (T2D).Patients with T2D ( = 84) (HbA 6.6 ± 0.% [49 ± 10 mmol/mol], known disease duration 39 ± 27 months) were randomly assigned to 24 weeks of treatment with 25 mg daily EMPA or placebo. The primary end point was the difference of the change in LFC as measured with magnetic resonance methods from 0 (baseline) to 24 weeks between groups. Tissue-specific insulin sensitivity (secondary outcome) was assessed by two-step clamps using an isotope dilution technique. Exploratory analysis comprised circulating surrogate markers of insulin sensitivity and  function. Statistical comparison was done by ANCOVA adjusted for respective baseline values, age, sex, and BMI.EMPA treatment resulted in a placebo-corrected absolute of -1.8% (95% CI -3.4, -0.2%;  = 0.02) and relative change in LFC of -22% (-36, -7%;  = 0.009) from baseline to end of treatment, corresponding to a 2.3-fold greater reduction. Weight loss occurred only with EMPA (placebo-corrected change -2. kg [-3.7, -1.4 kg];  < 0.001), while no placebo-corrected change in tissue-specific insulin sensitivity was observed. EMPA treatment also led to placebo-corrected changes in uric acid (-74 mol/L [-108, -42 mol/L];  < 0.001) and high-molecular-weight adiponectin (36% [16, 60%];  < 0.001) levels from 0 to 24 weeks.EMPA effectively reduces hepatic fat in patients with T2D with excellent glycemic control and short known disease duration. Interestingly, EMPA also decreases circulating uric acid and raises adiponectin levels despite unchanged insulin sensitivity. EMPA could therefore contribute to the early treatment of nonalcoholic  disease in T2D.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31522360>High dietary lipid level alters the growth, hepatic metabolism enzyme, and anti-oxidative capacity in juvenile largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides.</a></h1><p>The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of high dietary lipid levels on growth, metabolism, antioxidant capacity, and immune responses of largemouth bass. Fish (initial body weight 13.38 ± 0.11 g) were fed three isonitrogenous semi-purified diets containing %, 10%, and 20% lipid, respectively. The results indicated that fish fed 10% lipid diet showed significantly better final body weight, specific growth rate (SGR), protein efficiency ratio (PER), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared with that fed % lipid diet. Meanwhile, fish fed 20% lipid diet had a significantly higher viscera ratio (VR), hepatosomatic index (HSI), intraperitoneal fat ratio (IPF), and  lipid content than those fed the other diets. Higher alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) activities, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), free  acids (FFA), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) contents, and LDL-C/HDL-C value in plasma were recorded in fish fed 20% lipid diet, while higher insulin contents were obtained in fish fed % lipid diet. In addition, the highest carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activities in the  were also observed in fish fed 20% lipid diet. However, fish fed 20% lipid diet had a significantly lower superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities and higher MDA contents in  than those fed the other diets. The higher nitric oxide (NO) contents and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity in  were recorded in fish fed 10% lipid diet. Moreover, the alkaline phosphatase (ALP), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and lysozyme activities, and nitric oxide (NO) contents in plasma were higher in fish fed the 10% diets than the other groups. In conclusion, high dietary lipid levels could suppress growth performance and  anti-oxidative capacity, and reduce immune responses of largemouth bass.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31514003>Transcriptome analysis in normal human  cells exposed to 2, 3, 3', 4, 4',  - Hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB 156).</a></h1><p>Polychlorinated biphenyls are persistent environmental pollutants associated with the onset of non-alcoholic  disease in humans, but there is limited information on the underlying mechanism.

Microarray analysis of mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the cells was also performed after 3.4 μM PCB 156 treatment.Exposure to PCB 156 (3.4 μM, 72 h) resulted in significant increases of triacylglyceride and total cholesterol concentrations in L-02 cells. Microarray analysis identified 222 differentially expressed mRNAs and 628 differentially expressed lncRNAs. Gene Ontology and pathway analyses associated the differentially expressed mRNAs with metabolic and inflammatory processes. Moreover, lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network revealed 36 network pairs comprising 10 differentially expressed mRNAs and 34 dysregulated lncRNAs. The results of bioinformatics analysis further indicated that dysregulated lncRNA NONHSAT174696, lncRNA NONHSAT179219, and lncRNA NONHSAT161887, as the regulators of EDAR, CYP1B1, and ALDH3A1 respectively, played an important role in the PCB 156-induced lipid metabolism disorder.Our findings provide an overview of differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs in L-02 cells exposed to PCB 156, and contribute to the field of polychlorinated biphenyl-induced non-alcoholic  disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This class of drugs is used for the treatment of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Fenofibrate is one of the members of this class of synthetic PPARα receptor ligands. The oral administration of 0.3% fenofibrate caused a decrease in strength due to loss of body weight in laboratory animals when improving behavioural features. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of  cells showed a genotoxic effect of fenofibrate, due to accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which could be attributed to activation of peroxisomal β-oxidation processes, as well as to the lack of increase in the expression of genes encoding antioxidant defense proteins. Treatment with fenofibrate did not cause brain mtDNA damage. It has been shown that fenofibrate induced mitochondrial β-oxidation in the brain, as indicated by the increased expression of the Acadm and Cpt1a and Ppargc1a and Ppara. The study found no effect of fenofibrate on the increase of mitochondrial biogenesis in brain and  cells. Thus, we can conclude that fenofibrate significantly affects lipid metabolism in the  and brain, but in the  it is associated with an increase of oxidative stress, resulting in mtDNA oxidative damage. However, fenofibrate-induced increase in the expression of Ppargc1a is not associated with an increase of mitochondrial biogenesis.

NAFLD-which can develop into  fibrosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma-is defined as an excess accumulation of fat caused by abnormal lipid metabolism and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in hepatocytes. Recently, we reported that Peroxiredoxin  (Prx5) plays an essential role in regulating adipogenesis and suggested the need to further investigation on the potential curative effects of Prx5 on obesity-induced  disease. In the present study, we focused on the role of Prx5 in  disease. We found that Prx5 overexpression significantly suppressed cytosolic and mitochondrial ROS generation. Additionally, Prx5 regulated the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway and lipogenic gene (sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 and FAS) expression; it also inhibited lipid accumulation, resulting in the amelioration of free  acid-induced hepatic steatosis. Silence of Prx5 triggered de novo lipogenesis and abnormal lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Concordantly, Prx5 knockout mice exhibited a high susceptibility to obesity-induced hepatic steatosis.  sections of Prx5-deletion mice fed on a high-fat diet displayed Oil Red O-stained dots and small leaky shapes due to immoderate fat deposition. Collectively, our findings suggest that Prx5 functions as a protective regulator in  disease and that it may be a valuable therapeutic target for the management of obesity-related metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Mauriac syndrome (MS) is a glycogenic hepatopathy, initially described in 1930, characterized by growth failure, delayed puberty, cushingoid appearance, hepatomegaly with abnormal  enzymes, and hypercholesterolemia. HG is a condition with good prognosis and fast resolution after adequate glycemic control (although it has potential for relapse), with no case of evolution to end-stage  disease described.We describe a 26-year-old female, with T1DM complicated by severe retinopathy. The patient maintained poor glycemic control since childhood, presenting glycated hemoglobin persistently higher than 10% and recurrent episodes of ketoacidosis. In adolescence, she developed hepatomegaly and fluctuating elevation of aminotransferases and triglycerides. A small, nonrepresentative hepatic biopsy suggested macrovacuolar steatosis and mild fibrosis. After 15 years of diabetes, the patient was referred for gastroenterology clinic due to chronic diarrhea and exuberant hepatomegaly. Laboratory showed persistent elevation of aminotransferases and triglycerides. Bilirubin, iron metabolism, and coagulation were normal; viral serologies and autoimmune study were negative. Upper endoscopy, ileocolonoscopy, and enteroscopy presented no lesions. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging displayed massive hepatomegaly.  biopsy was repeated showing marked nuclear glycogenization, mild steatosis, and no fibrosis; electron microscopy revealed very large deposits of glycogen and pleomorphic mitochondria with an unusually dense matrix, described for the first time in this entity. The diagnosis of MS variant and diarrhea due to autonomic neuropathy were assumed.Currently, HG is a well-recognized disease that occurs at any age and can be present without the full spectrum of features initially described for MS.

There is an intriguing link between alopecia areata and gut dysbiosis. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been recommended to treat  (previously known as ) infection, and has also shown potentials in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and non-alcohol  disease.An 86-year-old man, with a history of sigmoid colon carcinoma, suffered from recurrent abdominal pain and distension, and diarrhea for six months, with inappetence. At admission, he was also diagnosed with depression. Upon physical examination, the patient presented with a 1. cm × 2.0 cm alopecia areata on his right occiput. Due to the negative results of laboratory testing, capsule endoscopy, and colonoscopy, the patient was diagnosed with noninfectious diarrhea, depressive disorder, and patchy alopecia areata. Considering that noninfectious diarrhea in the elderly patient was mainly caused by gut dysbiosis, he was given six rounds of FMT. His diarrhea improved remarkably one month after FMT, with improved appetite and disappearance of abdominal pain, distension, and depressive symptoms. Surprisingly, he reported new hair growth on the affected region of his scalp, with some of his white hair gradually turning to black, without taking any other therapies for alopecia areata before and after FMT.FMT might act as a potential therapy for patients who suffer from alopecia areata.

However, it is uncertain whether this association is influenced by major NAFLD susceptibility genes. In a sample of 230 overweight/obese children, 105 with NAFLD (hepatic fat fraction ≥% by magnetic resonance imaging) and 125 without NAFLD, rs738409 in PNPLA3, rs58542926 in TM6SF2, rs1260326 in GCKR, and rs641738 in MBOAT7 were genotyped. Abnormal kidney function was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 90 mL/min/1.73 m and/or the presence of microalbuminuria (24 h urinary albumin excretion between 30 and 300 mg). In comparison with children without NAFLD, those with NAFLD showed increased prevalence of reduced eGFR (13.3% vs. 1.6%;   ) and microalbuminuria (8.6% vs. 3.4%,   ).  and  risk alleles did not show any impact on kidney function, while the  G allele was associated with lower eGFR, but only in children with NAFLD ( = 0.003).

To address this knowledge gap, we aimed to develop a model for predicting non-completion of a specialist multidisciplinary service for clinically severe obesity, termed the Metabolic Rehabilitation Programme (MRP).Using a case-control study design in a public hospital setting, we extracted data from medical records for all eligible patients with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥35 kg/m with either type 2 diabetes or  disease referred to the MRP from 2010 through 2015. Non-completion status (case definition) was coded for patients whom started but dropped-out of the MRP within 12 months. Using multivariable logistic regression, we tested the following baseline predictors hypothesised in previous research: age, gender, BMI, waist circumference, residential distance from the clinic, blood pressure, obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), current continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, current depression/anxiety, diabetes status, and medications. We used receiver operating characteristics and area under the curve to test the performance of models.Out of the 219 eligible patient records, 78 (35.6%) non-completion cases were identified. Significant differences between non-completers versus completers were: age (47.1 versus 54. years, p < 0.001); residential distance from the clinic (21.8 versus 17.1 km, p = 0.018); obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) (42.9% versus 56.7%, p = 0.050) and CPAP therapy (11.7% versus 28.4%, p = 0.005). The probability of non-completion could be independently associated with age, residential distance, and either OSA or CPAP. There was no statistically significant difference in performance between the alternate models (69.% versus 66.4%, p = 0.57).Non-completion of intensive specialist obesity management services is most common among younger patients, with fewer complex care needs, and those living further away from the clinic.

The maternal fasting response initiates a fetal  transcriptional program marked by upregulation of lipid- and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparα)-regulated genes. Impaired maternal lipid metabolism alters circulating lipid metabolite concentrations and enhances the fetal response to fasting, which is largely dependent on fetal Pparα. Maternal fasting also improves metabolic deficits in fetal carbohydrate metabolism by increasing the availability of alternative substrates. Impairment of both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in pregnant dams further exacerbates the fetal  transcriptional response to nutrient deprivation. Together, these data demonstrate a regulatory role for mitochondrial macronutrient metabolism in mediating maternal-fetal metabolic communication, particularly when nutrients are limited.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

High UA was defined as ≥ 75th percentile by sex in children and adolescents.The population was stratified in four categories: (1) normal eGFR and absence of NAFLD (ReGFR/NAFLD) (n = 1,236); (2) ReGFR and absence of NAFLD (ReGFR/NAFLD (n = 155); (3) normal eGFR and presence of NAFLD (ReGFR/NAFLD (n = 1019); (4) presence of both conditions (ReGFR/NAFLD) (n = 155). Proportions of youth with high UA across the four categories were 17%, 30%, 33% and 46%, respectively (P < 0.0001). Young people with high levels of UA had odds ratio (95% CI) of 2.11 (1.43-3.11) for ReGFR; 2.82 (2.26-3.45) for NAFLD; and .04 (3.45-7.39) for both conditions (P < 0.0001 for all), independently of major confounders.High levels of UA were independently associated with ReGFR, NAFLD and the combination of both conditions in young people with OW/OB. The strength of this association was the highest in cases presenting both reduced eGFR and NAFLD.

Host-microbial interaction has gained attention as one of the risk factors for NASH. Recently, -gene positive  expressing cell surface collagen-binding protein, Cnm (-positive ), was shown to aggravate NASH in model mice. Here, we assessed the detection rate of -positive  in oral samples from patients with NASH among NAFLD.This single hospital cohort study included 41 patients with NAFLD. NASH was diagnosed histologically or by clinical score. The prevalence of -positive , oral hygiene and blood tests, including  enzymes, adipocytokines and inflammatory and fibrosis markers, were assessed in biopsy-proven or clinically suspected NASH among NAFLD.Prevalence of -positive  was significantly higher in patients with NASH than patients without NASH (OR 3.8; 95% CI 1.02 to 15.). The -positive  was related to decreased numbers of naturally remaining teeth and increased type IV collagen 7S level (median (IQR) 10.0 (.0-17.) vs 20.0 (.0-25.0), p=0.06; .1 (4.0-7.9) vs 4.4 (3.7-.3), p=0.13, respectively).Prevalence of -positive  in the oral cavity could be related to fibrosis of NASH among NAFLD.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

We examined whether  fibrosis, diagnosed by FibroScan , correlates with chronic vascular complications in a cohort of T2DM.We recruited 394 outpatients with T2DM attending five Italian diabetes centres who underwent  ultrasonography (US), FibroScan and extensive evaluation of macrovascular and microvascular diabetic complications.Steatosis by US was present in 89%. Almost all patients (96%) were on hypoglycaemic drugs, 58% had at least one chronic vascular complication, 19% a macrovascular complication (prior myocardial infarction and/or ischaemic stroke) and 33% a microvascular one (26% chronic kidney disease [CKD]; 16% retinopathy; 6% neuropathy). In all, 171 (72%) patients had CAP ≥ 248dB/m (ie hepatic steatosis), whereas 83 (21%) patients had LSM ≥ 7.0/6.2 kPa (M/XL probes) (significant  fibrosis). CAP was not associated with any macro/microvascular complications, whereas LSM ≥ 7.0/6.2 kPa was independently associated with prior cardiovascular disease (adjusted OR 3.3, 95%CI 1.2-8.8; P = .02) and presence of microvascular complications (adjusted OR 4.2, 95%CI 1.-11.4; P = .005), mainly CKD (adjusted OR 3.6, 95%CI 1.3-10.1; P = .01) and retinopathy (adjusted OR 3.7, CI 95% 1.2-11.9; P = .02). Neither diabetes duration nor haemoglobin A1c differed according to CAP or LSM values.Significant fibrosis, detected by FibroScan , is independently associated with increased prevalence of macrovascular and microvascular complications, thus opening a new scenario in the use of this tool for a comprehensive evaluation of hepatic and vascular complications in patients with T2DM.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The presence of underlying cirrhosis was assessed based on published criteria.Of 5144 eligible patients with HCC, 11.7% had no underlying cirrhosis. Non-cirrhotic patients were older (64.1 vs 61.2 years), more frequently females (33.9% vs 20.8%) and less frequently black (8.3% vs 12.4%) (P < .001 for all). Among non-cirrhotic patients, non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) was the most common  disease (26.3%), followed by hepatitis C virus (HCV) (12.1%) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) (10%) infections. As of 2014, there was increased percentage of cirrhotic HCC and a decline in non-cirrhotic HCC mainly due to significant annual increases in cirrhotic HCC due to HCV (0.96% [P < .0001]) and NAFLD (0.66% [P = .003]). Patients with non-cirrhotic HCC had larger tumours (8.9 vs .3 cm), were less frequently within Milan criteria (15% vs 39%), more frequently underwent resection (43.6% vs 8%) (P < .001 for all) and had better overall survival than cirrhotic HCC patients (median 1.8 vs 1.3 years, P = .004).Nearly 12% of HCCs occurred in patients without underlying cirrhosis. NAFLD was the most common  disease in these patients. During the study, the frequency of non-cirrhotic HCC decreased, whereas that of cirrhotic HCC increased.

Vitamin D may be a good therapeutic option for NAFLD patients due to its insulin sensitizing and anti-inflammatory properties. The purpose is to investigate the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on various parameters in NAFLD patients. In this double blind randomized placebo controlled trial, 109 patients of NAFLD diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound and  enzymes were divided into two groups for treatment with oral capsule of vitamin D3 50,000 IU and capsule placebo weekly for a period of 12 weeks. Anthropometric, chemical, metabolic and inflammatory parameters were assessed pre and post treatment by using SPSS 16. After 12 weeks oral treatment with vitamin D , its level increased significantly in vitamin D group from 12.±4.2 to 24.±3.8 ng/ml p =0.003 vs placebo group. This rise was further accompanied by decrease in HOMA-IR (4.56±1.6 to 3.26± 1.8 p=0.003)  enzymes (i.e. ALT: 72.±17.6 to 54.±14.

However non significant changes were observed in both groups in terms of body weight, BMI, and serum lipid profiles. Vitamin D supplementation not only improved its own status but also caused a significant amelioration in metabolic, chemical and inflammatory parameters in NAFLD patients.

Consecutive gout patients were recruited between August 2017 and December 2018. Demographic information, clinical characteristics and comorbidities were collected. BC was assessed by bioelectric impedance analysis including body fat percentage (BF%), trunk and limb BF%, appendicular skeletal muscle index. Overfat was defined by BF% ≥25% for male and ≥35% for female. The association between BC and serum uric acid (sUA) was evaluated by multiple linear regression.  A total of 362 gout patients were recruited with median age 38 (30, 52) years, 96.1% (348/362) were male. Mean sUA was (551±133) μmol/L. The mean BF% was (25.8±6.4)% with 53.6%(194/362) patients overfat. Male gout patients with overfat showed more affected joints [4(2, 6) vs. 2(2, )], higher sUA [(576±126)μmol/L vs. (523±134) μmol/L], higher prevalence of dyslipidemia [70.1%(131/187) vs. 54.0%(87/161)], metabolic syndrome [60.8%(118/187) vs. 28.0%(47/161)],  [58.2%(113/187) vs. 35.1%(59/161)] and hypertension [44.4%(83/187) vs. 25.%(41/161)] than male patients with normal fat (all <0.05). Their BF%, trunk BF% and limb BF% were positively correlated with the numbers of affected joints, sUA, metabolic syndrome, , and hypertension, respectively (=0.154-0.435, all <0.05). Multivariable linear regression suggested that BF% (=4.29, =0.020) and trunk BF% (=9.11, =0.007), but not limb BF%, were positively correlated with sUA.  Overfat is very common in gout patients. The proportion of trunk fat in male patients is positively correlated with sUA.

NAFLD was assessed by means of  biopsies which were systematically collected during the procedures. The estimated ejection fraction was obtained by means of transthoracic echocardiograms. The main outcome evaluated was a possible association between NAFLD features and ejection fraction. The results of  biopsies and the respective degrees of severity of each NAFLD feature were also correlated with the ejection fraction and main anthropometric, biochemical, and clinical variables.Of 112 individuals, 86.6% were female and the mean age was 38. ± 9.3 years. It was observed that the average estimated ejection fraction (EEF) was significantly lower among individuals with  fibrosis (67.6 ± .% vs. 70.8 ± 4.9%, p = 0.008). After adjustment for confounding variables in a multivariate model, the degree of  fibrosis was independently associated with the EEF (R = - 0.3, p = 0.02).Among individuals with morbid obesity, the findings of this study are suggestive that  fibrosis confirmed by histopathological examination is associated with a slight impairment of left ventricular function.

It has been demonstrated that the total extracts from EL could significantly inhibit the joint swelling in MSU-induced acute gout arthritis rat model at middle and high doses (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), as meanwhile, better performance than that of positive control (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) has been observed at the dose of 10 g/kg. Aiming to search potential compounds and probable mechanisms, network pharmacology, molecular docking and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were adopted, leading to the hypothesis of 17 targets related to different pathogenesis of gout and  potential compounds (C36, C107, C124, C125 and C130) among 156 selected compounds, playing synergetic role with multiple targets. Instead of the guiding ideology of "a gene, a drug, a disease", varieties of compounds but not a single one from EL display holistic performance through multiple pathways with multi-targets. It was noteworthy that Xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase (XDH), Prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 (PTGS2),  acid-binding protein,  (FABP1), Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), and Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARA) were the key targets with intensely interaction. Furthermore, the functional enrichment analysis indicated that EL probably produced the gout protection effects by synergistic regulation in multiple biological pathways, including Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, etc.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Age is strongly associated with the development and progression of NAFLD/NASH, but the natural history of pediatric NAFLD is still not fully understood. Here, we evaluated the age-related alterations of NASH in -, 9- and 13-wk-old male Sprague-Dawley rats that were fed a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet (30% fat, 1.25% cholesterol and 0.% sodium cholate, w/w) for 9 wk (6 rats/group). Our results showed that the cumulative energy intake, body weight gain and food efficacy during the 9-wk rearing period were highest in the youngest group and lowest in the oldest group. Serologically, almost all parameters including the serum triglyceride and total cholesterol were similar regardless of age. Histopathological findings, such as hepatic steatosis, lobular inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning, were also similar regardless of age, but hepatic fibrosis was more evident in the oldest group. Also, the mRNA expression levels of some fibrogenic, inflammatory, oxidative stress and cholesterol or lipid metabolism-related genes in the  were highest in the oldest group and lowest in the youngest group, although the difference was not statistically significant. These results indicated that aging is likely associated with the development of NASH. Because the cumulative energy intake and daily food intake/body weight were not similar among groups in the present study, further studies designed with an equivalent daily food intake/body weight among groups are needed in order to interpret the exact nutritional effect.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649231> in a two days old neonate.</a></h1><p>Neonatal death due to inborn error of metabolism (IEM) is rare in Malaysia.

Recently, a new score was developed to estimate body fat percentage (relative fat mass, RFM). We aimed to evaluate the value of RFM in predicting the presence and severity of NAFLD, compared with other anthropometric measurements.RFM, body mass index (BMI), and other anthropometric measurements were evaluated in two cohorts of subjects: a cohort from a Portuguese prospective epidemiological study (e_Cor) and morbidly obese patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. We evaluated if RFM and BMI were related with the presence and severity of  disease, which was assessed by noninvasive tools in the first cohort and by  histology in the morbidly obese cohort. The independence of relations found in univariate analysis was assessed with multivariable logistic regression analysis.In the general population cohort, 744 subjects (48% male) were enrolled. BMI-defined obesity was present in 23% and RFM-defined obesity in 86%. Insulin resistance (IR) related with BMI-defined obesity (OR 4.37 [2.16-8.84]) and weight (OR 1.05 [1.02-1.08]) in men, and waist circumference (WC) (OR 1.07 [1.03-1.11]) in women. Dyslipidemia and hypertension related with RFM-defined obesity in men (OR 2.96 [1.36-6.47] and OR .37 [1.31-22.06], respectively). Ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD in 33% related with weight in men (OR 1.03 [1.003-1.06] and WC in women (OR 1.06 [1.02-1.10]). In men, ALT elevation related with weight (OR 1.04 [1.02-1.07]). In women, advanced fibrosis (estimated by NAFLD Fibrosis Score) associated with BMI-defined obesity (OR 42.43 [3.61-498.13]). In the morbidly obese cohort, 152 subjects were enrolled, of whom 84% were female, 37% had steatohepatitis, and 9.4% had advanced fibrosis. Adiponectin associated inversely and leptin positively with RFM in men. The severity of steatosis increased linearly with BMI and WC in women.

This article discusses the evaluation of  infiltration in donor  parenchyma on multidetector computed tomography.The methods of hepatic fat estimation include measurement of hepatic attenuation in HU and calculation of the  attenuation index (LAI).  attenuation values reflect the degree of steatosis. Average attenuation of  parenchyma is calculated by placing the circular region of interest of at least 1 cm area at multiple places in the  on noncontrast CT images. Splenic attenuation is measured by placing the circular region of interest at its upper, middle, and lower poles. The LAI is the difference between mean hepatic attenuation and mean splenic attenuation.A total of 52 donors were evaluated as potential recipients (34 men, 18 women; mean age, 33.2 years; range, 23-55 years). In 34 donors  attenuation index (LAI) values were from 2 HU to 22 HU. An LAI >  HU correctly predicted the absence of significant macrovesicular steatosis. These donors were acceptable for a  transplant. The LAI values of -10 to  HU were suggestive of mild to moderate steatosis (6%-30%); 18 (34.6%) volunteers did not proceed to donation because of negative LAI < - HU. In 2 cases with LAI of -7 and LAI of -8  biopsy was performed, and 30% steatosis was confirmed in the pathohistologic examination. Unacceptable  biopsy result was considered as contraindication for donation. The LAI values of < -10 HU were suggestive of moderate to severe hepatic steatosis of 30% or greater. In these cases  biopsy is not needed, as such donors are not acceptable for  transplant.Computed tomography imaging provides a detailed evaluation of  infiltration in donor  parenchyma.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We conducted an observational study to describe the management of NAFLD in patients with metabolic syndrome in Russia.A total of 2843 adult patients from 174 medical sites across 6 federal districts of Russia with newly diagnosed NAFLD, who had at least one of four comorbidities, namely overweight/obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolaemia, and who received phosphatidylcholine (PPC) as an adjunctive treatment to standard care, were enrolled during 2015-2016.Overall, 2263 patients (79.6%) had at least two metabolic comorbidities associated with NAFLD; overweight/obesity was the most common comorbidity reported in 2298 patients (80.8%). Simple steatosis was the most frequently identified clinical form of NAFLD, diagnosed in 2128 patients (74.9%). Among hypertensive patients, ACE inhibitors, statins, and sartans were most commonly prescribed. Biguanides were administered in more than half of diabetic patients.

Changes in the expression levels and activities of drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters have been reported in patients with NAFLD and relevant rodent models. Here, we evaluated whether the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolic acid (MPA), an immunosuppressant, would be altered in rats with NAFLD. NAFLD was induced by feeding a diet containing 1% (w/w) orotic acid for 20 days. The extent of hepatic glucuronidation of MPA to a major metabolite, mycophenolic acid-7-O-glucuronide (MPAG), did not differ between rats with NAFLD and controls. The expression levels of hepatic multidrug resistance-associated protein 2, responsible for biliary excretion of MPAG, were comparable in rats with NAFLD and controls; the biliary excretion of MPAG was also similar in the two groups. Compared with control rats, rats with NAFLD did not exhibit significant changes in the areas under the plasma concentration-time curves of MPA or MPAG after intravenous ( mg/kg) or oral (10 mg/kg) administration of MPA.

The 6-month rate of decrease in steatosis grades was higher in the orlistat group [45.6%  22.% (ITT analysis), 57.4%  30.3% (PP analysis), both  < 0.001]. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified orlistat treatment [odds ratio (OR) = 2.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-.6,  = 0.036] as an independent predictor of steatosis improvement. Among patients with orlistat therapy, weight loss (OR = 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.4,  = 0.040) and severe steatosis (OR = 6.7, 95% CI: 1.1-40.3,  = 0.03) remained predictive of steatosis improvement.Orlistat can effectively promote steatosis improvement and may serve as a treatment option for controlling NAFLD.ChiCTR-IPR-17012258.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31492698>Induction via Functional Protein Stabilization of Hepatic Cytochromes P450 upon gp78/Autocrine Motility Factor Receptor (AMFR) Ubiquitin E3-Ligase Genetic Ablation in Mice: Therapeutic and Toxicological Relevance.</a></h1><p>The hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchored monotopic proteins, cytochromes P450 (P450s), are enzymes that metabolize endobiotics (physiologically active steroids and  acids), as well as xenobiotics including therapeutic/chemotherapeutic drugs, nutrients, carcinogens, and toxins. Alterations of hepatic P450 content through synthesis, inactivation, or proteolytic turnover influence their metabolic function. P450 proteolytic turnover occurs via ER-associated degradation (ERAD) involving ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent proteasomal degradation (UPD) as a major pathway. UPD critically involves P450 protein ubiquitination by E2/E3 Ub-ligase complexes. We have previously identified the ER-polytopic gp78/AMFR (autocrine motility factor receptor) as a relevant E3 in CYP3A4, CYP3A23, and CYP2E1 UPD. We now document that -conditional genetic ablation of gp78/AMFR in male mice disrupts P450 ERAD, resulting in statistically significant stabilization of Cyp2a5 and Cyp2c, in addition to that of Cyp3a and Cyp2e1. More importantly, we establish that such stabilization is of the functionally active P450 proteins, leading to corresponding statistically significant enhancement of their drug-metabolizing capacities. Our findings, with clinically relevant therapeutic drugs (nicotine, coumarin, chlorzoxazone, and acetaminophen) and the prodrug (tamoxifen) as P450 substrates, reveal that P450 ERAD disruption could influence therapeutic drug response and/or toxicity, warranting serious consideration as a potential source of clinically relevant drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Because gp78/AMFR is not only an E3 Ub-ligase, but also a cell-surface prometastatic oncogene that is upregulated in various malignant cancers, our finding that hepatic gp78/AMFR knockout can enhance P450-dependent bioactivation of relevant cancer chemotherapeutic prodrugs is of therapeutic relevance and noteworthy in prospective drug design and development. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The cell-surface and ER transmembrane protein gp78/AMFR, a receptor for the prometastatic autocrine motility factor (AMF), as well as an E3 ubiquitin-ligase involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of not only the tumor metastatic suppressor KAI1 but also of hepatic cytochromes P450, is upregulated in various human cancers, enhancing their invasiveness, metastatic potential, and poor prognosis. -specific gp78/AMFR genetic ablation results in functional protein stabilization of several hepatic P450s and consequently enhanced drug and prodrug metabolism, a feature that could be therapeutically exploited in the bioactivation of chemotherapeutic prodrugs through design and development of novel short-term gp78/AMFR chemical inhibitors.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668954>Prenatal exposure to diesel exhaust PM programmed non-alcoholic  disease differently in adult male offspring of mice fed normal chow and a high-fat diet.</a></h1><p>Air pollution is one of the leading preventable threats to public health. Emerging evidence indicates that exposure to environmental stressors is associated with abnormal foetal development. However, how prenatal exposure to diesel exhaust PM (DEP) predisposes adult offspring to the development of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) remains unclear. To examine this, C57BL/6J mice were exposed to DEP or a vehicle before conception and during pregnancy and fed normal chow or a high-fat diet. Then, the hepatic  accumulation in the adult male offspring and possible molecular mechanisms were assessed. Our data showed that prenatal exposure to DEP on normal chow led to hepatic steatosis in adult male offspring with normal  function. However, prenatal DEP exposure relieved the hepatic steatosis and  function in offspring of mice fed a high-fat diet. Furthermore, prenatal exposure to DEP on normal chow increased lipogenesis and worsened  acid oxidation. The counteractive effect of prenatal DEP exposure on high-fat-diet-induced hepatic steatosis was produced through upregulated adenosine '-monophosphate-activated protein kinase, and this improved lipogenesis and  acid oxidation. Collectively, prenatal exposure to DEP programmed the development of NAFLD differently in the adult male offspring of mice fed normal chow and a high-fat diet, showing the pleotrophic effects of exposure to adverse environmental factors in early life.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we aimed to explore the relationship between vitamin D levels and NAFLD based on population survey data. This cross-sectional study was conducted based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.  steatosis was diagnosed by ultrasonography. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the relationship between vitamin D status and NAFLD. A total of 9,782 participants were identified in this analysis, with 46.8% male and an average age of 44.41±0.16 y old. Among them, 6,047 (61.8%) cases were without NAFLD, 1,357 (13.9%) had mild NAFLD, 1,594 (16.3%) had moderate and 784 (8.0%) had severe NAFLD. Compared to those with non-NAFLD or mild NAFLD, patients in the moderate to severe NAFLD group had higher vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency rates (12.4% vs 11.% and 36.8% vs 33.2%, respectively). After adjustment for male gender, older age, race, BMI, history of diabetes and vitamin D intake, vitamin D levels were independently associated with the severity of NAFLD (vitamin D deficiency group OR: 1.314, 95% CI: 1.129 to 1.529, vitamin D insufficiency group OR: 1.203, 95% CI: 1.090 to 1.328). Besides that, cold season was also found to be an independent factor for NAFLD (OR: 0.896, 95% CI: 0.820 to 0.979). Lower vitamin D level is an independent risk factor for NAFLD. Vitamin D levels are inversely associated with the severity of NAFLD. Cold season increases the risk of NAFLD independently.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612395>Curcumin Recovers Intracellular Lipid Droplet Formation Through Increasing Perilipin  Gene Expression in Activated Hepatic Stellate Cells In Vitro.</a></h1><p>The activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is a major event during hepatic fibrogenesis. Restoration of intracellular lipid droplet (LD) formation turns the activated HSC back to a quiescent state. Our previous studies have shown that curcumin suppresses HSC activation through increasing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, gamma (PPARγ) and ' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activities. This study aims at evaluating the effect of curcumin on lipid accumulation in HSCs and hepatocytes, and further elucidating the underlying mechanisms. Now we showed that curcumin increased LD formation in activated HSCs and stimulated the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein and  acid synthase, and reduced the expression of adipose triglyceride lipase. Exogenous perilin5 expression in primary HSCs promoted LD formation. Perilipin  siRNA eliminated curcumin-induced LD formation in HSCs. These results suggest that curcumin recovers LD formation and lipid accumulation in activated HSCs by increasing perilipin  gene expression. Furthermore, inhibition of AMPK or PPARγ activity blocked curcumin's effect on Plin5 gene expression and LD formation. Our results provide a novel evidence in vitro for curcumin as a safe, effective candidate to treat  fibrosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639886>Non-invasive monitoring of hepatic steatosis via acoustic structure quantification of ultrasonography with MR spectroscopy as the reference standard.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate whether monitoring hepatic steatosis by ultrasonography with acoustic structure quantification (ASQ) is feasible, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) as the reference standard.Thirty-six patients with suspected  disease underwent both untrasonography with ASQ and MRS on the same day. After a mean follow-up period of 11.4±2. months, follow-up ultrasonography with ASQ and MRS were performed on 27 patients to evaluate whether hepatic steatosis had improved. The focal disturbance (FD) ratio, as calculated using ASQ, and the hepatic fat fraction (HFF), estimated by MRS, were obtained at both initial and follow-up examinations. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the correlations between ordinal values.The FD ratio showed a strong, negative linear correlation with the HFF after logarithmic transformation of both variables from the initial examinations of 36 patients (ρ=-0.888, P<0.001) and the follow-up examinations of 27 patients (ρ=-0.920, P<0.001). There was also a significant, negative linear correlation between the change in the logarithm of the FD ratio and the change in the logarithm of the HFF by MRS over the follow-up period (ρ=-0.645, P<0.001). In 16 patients with an increased FD ratio on follow-up, the HFF on follow-up MRS significantly decreased, and high-density lipoprotein levels significantly increased, whereas low-density lipoprotein levels tended to decrease.The FD ratio was significantly correlated with the HFF at both the initial and follow-up examinations, and there was also a significant correlation between changes in the FD ratio and changes in the HFF over the follow-up period.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31529393>Body Composition Changes Following a Very-Low-Calorie Pre-Operative Diet in Patients Undergoing Bariatric Surgery.</a></h1><p> in obese patients increases the technical difficulty of bariatric surgery. Pre-operative weight loss with a very-low-calorie diet (VLCD) is commonly used to facilitate surgery. Few studies have quantified the systemic effect of rapid pre-operative weight loss on body composition. The objective of this study is to evaluate body composition changes in bariatric surgery patients undergoing a VLCD.Body composition assessments were performed between August 2017 and January 2019 using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry immediately before and after a 2-week VLCD at St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne. Data collected prospectively pre- and post-VLCD included total body weight, excess body weight, body mass index (BMI), lean body mass (LBM), fat mass (FM) and bone mineral content (BMC). The pre- and post-operative results were compared.Forty-four patients completed both the 2-week VLCD and body composition assessments. Following a 2-week VLCD, patients lost a mean of 4. kg (range - 0.3 to 9.) in a total body weight and 8.8% (range - 0.9 to 17.1) of excess body weight, with a mean reduction in body mass index of 1.6 kg/m (range - 0.2 to 3.1). Loss of LBM was 2.8 kg and was significantly greater than loss of FM, 1.7 kg (p < 0.05). BMC changes were insignificant.A VLCD is an effective tool for pre-operative weight reduction. In this cohort, a large amount of the total weight loss was attributed to a loss of lean body mass. The impact of significant lean body mass loss and its relationship to short- and long-term health outcomes warrants further assessment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673541>Relative skeletal muscle mass and non-alcoholic  disease: from association to causation.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536073>Evaluation of the functional quality of rapeseed oil obtained by different extraction processes in a Sprague-Dawley rat model.</a></h1><p>The nutritional function of vegetable oil is influenced by different oil extraction methods. In this study, the effects of different processing techniques on the quality of rapeseed oil and animal lipid metabolism were evaluated. Results showed that rapeseed oil obtained by the aqueous enzymatic extraction (AEE) method had the highest polyphenol (152.08 ± 11.44 mg GAE per kg), α-tocopherol (208.97 ± 15.84 mg kg-1), and β-carotene (.40 mg kg-1) contents and a better oxidation resistance. It was noted in an experiment on rats fed with diets containing rapeseed oils that AEE rapeseed oil reduces total cholesterol (TC), triacylglycerol (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), aspartate transaminase (ALT) and alanine transaminase (AST) in high-fat diet rats by 27.09%, 11.81%, 35.52%, 31.02% and 27.61%, respectively, and the body and  weights of rats were decreased. mRNA expression indicated that AEE could significantly down-regulate  acid synthase (FAS) and up-regulate acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1) gene expression levels (P < 0.05).

Malignant transformation is an exceptionally rare complication of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1A)-inactivated hepatocellular adenomas. This subtype is characterized by loss of   acid binding protein immunoexpression. In this study, we characterized the histopathologic spectrum of 13   acid binding protein-deficient hepatocellular adenoma cases showing malignant transformation from multiple centers. Clinicopathologic characteristics of these patients were evaluated. Stains for reticulin,   acid binding protein, beta-catenin and glutamine synthetase were applied to these lesions. Moreover, the findings were compared to patients with β-catenin mutated hepatocellular adenoma.   acid binding protein-deficient hepatocellular adenomas with borderline features/carcinoma were seen predominantly in females (77%) with an average age of 46 ± 18 years and multiple lesions (77%; five patients with adenomatosis). Meanwhile, β-catenin mutated hepatocellular adenoma patients with malignant transformation were predominantly male (67%, p = 0.018) with single lesion (86%, p = 0.0009). The largest   acid binding protein-deficient hepatocellular adenoma nodule in each patient ranged from 4 to 15. cm. Loss of   acid binding protein by immunohistochemistry was noted in all adenoma and borderline/carcinoma components. Features of malignant transformation were pseudoglandular architecture (85%), cytologic atypia (85%), architectural atypia (100%) and lack of steatosis (100%). Other findings included myxoid change (39%), peliosis (46%) and sinusoidal dilatation (46%). Molecular studies confirmed somatic inactivation of HNF1A in 3 cases and absence of TERT promotor and exon 3 CTNNB1 mutations in five cases. To summarize,   acid binding protein-deficient hepatocellular adenoma with malignant transformation is most frequently seen in female patients with multiple lesions. Most of these lesions demonstrate pseudoglandular architecture, cytologic and architectural atypia, with lack of steatosis. The natural history of these lesions is relatively benign with the exception of disease recurrence in 1 patient.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31598559>Prevalence and risk factors of non-alcoholic  disease in southwest Iran: a population-based case-control study.</a></h1><p>Few population-based studies have been conducted to report the prevalence of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and determine its risk factors in Iran, particularly in Shahrekord, southwest Iran. The main aim of this population-based, case-control study was to determine the prevalence of NAFLD and its potential risk factors in an Iranian population-based cohort study in Shahrekord, Iran.We compared 1153 cases with NAFLD at 35 to 70 years to 1153 frequency-matched NAFLD-free controls from a population-based Shahrekord cohort study. Data collection and assessed risk factors (demographics, anthropometrics, clinical and biochemical factors, and laboratory tests) were performed based on the Shahrekord cohort study protocol. Chi-square test, stepwise selection with backward likelihood ratio, logistic regression and log-binomial regression model with 95% confidence interval were performed to determine risk factors with significant effects on NAFLD.In this study, the mean (± standard deviation) age of the participants was 50.23 (±8.70) years. The prevalence of NAFLD and metabolic syndrome with 95% confidence interval were 16.47% (15.61-17.36%) and 32.74% (30.83-34.70%), respectively. There was a significant difference in the frequency of waist circumstance, triglycerides, body mass index, blood pressure, and alanine aminotransferase between cases and controls ( < 0.001). According to log-binomial model results, socioeconomic status, hypertension, diabetes, and physical activity were significantly associated with NAFLD.Our findings have important clinical and public health implications in southwest Iran for monitoring the prevalence of NAFLD and important risk factors to manage, screen, prevent, and reduce NAFLD and related factors.Copyright: © 2019 Clinical and Experimental Hepatology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673540>Increasing contribution of non-alcoholic  disease to hepatocellular carcinoma incidence and mortality in U.S. Medicare.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31479572>Association between non-alcoholic  disease and risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation in healthy adults.</a></h1><p>Previous studies demonstrated conflicting results regarding the association between non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and atrial fibrillation (AF).

We analysed a large population-based cohort to evaluate the association between NAFLD and AF.We evaluated 334 280 healthy individuals without comorbidities who underwent National Health check-ups in South Korea from 2009 to 2014. NAFLD was defined by a surrogate marker, the  index (FLI). The association between FLI and AF incidence was analysed using multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models.During a median follow-up of .3 years, 1415 subjects (0.4%) were newly diagnosed with AF. Subjects were categorized into quartile groups according to FLI (range: Q1, 0-4.9; Q2, .0-12.; Q3, 12.6-31.0; Q4, >31.0). The cumulative incidence of AF was significantly higher in subjects with higher FLIs than in those with lower FLIs (Q1, 167 [0.2%]; Q2, 281 [0.3%]; Q3, 470 [0.6%]; Q4, 497 [0.6%]; P < .001). Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) indicated that a higher FLI was independently associated with an increased risk for AF (HR between Q4 and Q1, 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.63; P = .002). After further adjustment for the interim events (diabetes, hypertension, heart failure and myocardial infarction), this association remained statistically significant (HR between Q4 and Q1, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.19-2.03; P = .001).NAFLD, assessed by FLI, was independently associated with increased risk for AF in healthy Korean population.

The primary objective of this study was determining whether obesity severity is associated with NAFLD severity. By using paediatric classifications for severe obesity, clinicians may be able to better risk stratify patients, which in turn would guide more effective management and treatment.Retrospective cohort study including patients followed at Cincinnati Children's Medical Center for NAFLD. Patients were categorized as overweight or class I, II, III obese based on established body mass index (BMI) cut-offs.  disease severity was determined using biochemical, imaging (magnetic resonance elastography [MRE]), and histologic evidence of  injury.Three cohorts were studied individually based on the method used to assess disease severity (biochemical n = 767, imaging n = 366, and histology n = 249). Between the three cohorts, there were significant differences in age, proportion of patients with class II and class III obesity, and serum alanine transaminase (ALT) levels. In the biochemistry cohort, the odds of having ALT > 80 U/L were highest in patients with class III obesity (P = .026). In the imaging cohort,  stiffness was significantly different between BMI groups of patients (P = .001). In the histology cohort, those with class III obesity had significantly higher odds of NAFLD activity score (NAS) ≥  (P = .012).Obesity severity is associated with  disease severity.

Thus, it is imperative to develop novel diagnostic tools that together with  biopsy help to differentiate mild and advanced degrees of steatosis. Ex-vivo  samples were collected from mice fed a methionine-choline deficient diet for two or eight weeks, and from a control group. The degree of hepatic steatosis was histologically evaluated, and fat content was assessed by Oil-Red O staining. On the other hand, fluorescence spectroscopy was used for the assessment of the steatosis progression. Fluorescence spectra were recorded at excitation wavelengths of 330, 365, 385, 405, and 415 nm by establishing surface contact of the fiber optic probe with the  specimens. A multi-variate statistical approach based on principal component analysis followed by quadratic discriminant analysis was applied to spectral data to obtain classifiers able to distinguish mild and moderate stages of steatosis at the different excitation wavelengths. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were computed to compare classifier's performances for each one of the five excitation wavelengths and steatosis stages. Optimal sensitivity and specificity were calculated from the corresponding ROC curves using the Youden index. Intensity in the endogenous fluorescence spectra at the given wavelengths progressively increased according to the time of exposure to diet. The area under the curve of the spectra was able to discriminate control  samples from those with steatosis and differentiate among the time of exposure to the diet for most of the used excitation wavelengths. High specificities and sensitivities were obtained for every case; however, fluorescence spectra obtained by exciting with 405 nm yielded the best results distinguishing between the mentioned classes with a total classification error of 1.% and optimal sensitivities and specificities better than 98.6% and 99.3%, respectively.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578240>Controlled-release mitochondrial protonophore (CRMP) reverses dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis in dysmetabolic nonhuman primates.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is estimated to affect up to one-third of the general population, and new therapies are urgently required. Our laboratory previously developed a controlled-release mitochondrial protonophore (CRMP) that is functionally -targeted and promotes oxidation of hepatic triglycerides. Although we previously demonstrated that CRMP safely reverses hypertriglyceridemia, , hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis in diet-induced rodent models of obesity, there remains a critical need to assess its safety and efficacy in a model highly relevant to humans. Here, we evaluated the impact of longer-term CRMP treatment on hepatic mitochondrial oxidation and on the reversal of hypertriglyceridemia, NAFLD, and insulin resistance in high-fat, fructose-fed cynomolgus macaques ( 6) and spontaneously obese dysmetabolic rhesus macaques ( 12). Using positional isotopomer nuclear magnetic resonance tracer analysis (PINTA), we demonstrated that acute CRMP treatment (single dose,  mg/kg) increased rates of hepatic mitochondrial fat oxidation by 40%. Six weeks of CRMP treatment reduced hepatic triglycerides in both nonhuman primate models independently of changes in body weight, food intake, body temperature, or adverse reactions. CRMP treatment was also associated with a 20 to 30% reduction in fasting plasma triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol in dysmetabolic nonhuman primates. Oral administration of CRMP reduced endogenous glucose production by 18%, attributable to a 20% reduction in hepatic acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) content [as assessed by whole-body β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) turnover] and pyruvate carboxylase flux. Collectively, these studies provide proof-of-concept data to support the development of -targeted mitochondrial uncouplers for the treatment of metabolic syndrome in humans.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Several AA-derived eicosanoids (e.g., prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes) and DGLA-derived eicosanoids are reported to promote and/or prevent atherosclerosis progression through, at least in part, its proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects. To elucidate the effects of D5D inhibition by a D5D inhibitor on atherosclerosis, we generated a potent, orally available and selective D5D inhibitor, 2-(2,2,3,3,3-Pentafluoropropoxy)-3-[4-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy) phenyl]-,7-dihydro-3H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4,6-dione, compound-326, and examined its effects on Western-diet fed  knockout (KO) mice. Oral administration of compound-326 (3-10 mg/kg per day for 15 weeks) significantly inhibited the progression of atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta without affecting plasma total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Compound-326 significantly decreased AA levels, while it increased DGLA levels in the  and the blood accompanied by decreases in AA-derived eicosanoid production and increases in DGLA-derived eicosanoid production from the blood cells. We conclude that compound-326 prevents the progression of atherosclerosis in Western-diet fed  KO mice by modulating a profile of eicosanoid production, suggesting that D5D inhibitors can be a novel remedy for preventing atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular events.

The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of various clinical parameters on C-peptide (CPR) levels in patients with non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). Methods In this retrospective cohort study, the effects of clinical parameters on insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulin secretion levels (HOMA-β and fasting CPR) were investigated. Patients or Materials A total of 244 Japanese patients with histopathologically confirmed NAFLD were evaluated. Of these, 77 underwent the meal tolerance test (MTT) to evaluate the association of various clinical parameters with the CPR levels at 120 minutes. Results A multivariate analysis identified fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (≥110 mg/dL), AST (≥1.0×ULN IU/L), and a large waist circumference as independent predictors of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR ≥2.) or high fasting CPR levels. Significant parameters for a low insulin secretion capacity (HOMA-β <30%) were not detected, except for the parameters mentioned in the diagnostic criteria of diabetes mellitus. Regarding the MTT, the CPR levels at 120 minutes were significantly higher in patients with fibrosis stage 3-4 than in those with stage 0-2. Body composition and genetic variation did not affect the CPR levels at 120 minutes. A multivariate analysis identified fibrosis stage (3-4), hyperuricemia, FPG (≥110 mg/dL), and procollagen III peptide (>1.0 U/mL) as independent predictors of high CPR levels at 120 minutes. Conclusion The present study showed that high plasma glucose levels and severe  fibrosis stage influence insulin secretion levels in Japanese patients with NAFLD. Conservation of delayed insulin secretion levels was confirmed in patients with severe  fibrosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655165>Disturbance of mitochondrial functions associated with permeability transition pore opening induced by cis--tetradecenoic and myristic acids in  of adolescent rats.</a></h1><p>Patients affected by very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency commonly present  dysfunction whose pathogenesis is poorly known. We demonstrate here that major metabolites accumulating in this disorder, namely cis--tetradecenoic acid (Cis-) and myristic acid (Myr), markedly impair mitochondrial respiration, decreasing ATP production in  mitochondrial preparations from adolescent rats. Other parameters of mitochondrial homeostasis such as membrane potential (ΔΨm) and Caretention capacity were strongly compromised by these  acids, involving induction of mitochondrial permeability transition. The present data indicate that disruption of mitochondrial bioenergetics and Cahomeostasis may contribute to the  dysfunction of VLCAD deficient patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Mitochondria Research Society.

The noninvasive and accurate classification of NAFLD is still a challenging problem. In this study we pro- posed a new quantitative ultrasound (QUS) technique, which combined multiple QUS parameters for distinguishing steatosis stages. NAFLD was induced in the livers of 57 rats by gavage feeding with a high fat emulsion, while 8 rats were given a standard diet to serve as controls. Ex vivo ultrasound mea- surement was conducted for capturing the radiofrequency signal. Six QUS parameters were extracted and selected for linear combination. The results show that the overall performance of the combined parameter is better than that of the single QUS parameter. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) while using our proposed method to distinguish mild steatosis (stage S1) from the steatosis under stage S0 are 90.1%, 0.93, 0.88 and 0.97 respectively. In conclusion, the proposed method in this study can make up for the deficiency of single parameter and improve the quantitative staging ability of , and thus could play an important role in the diagnosis of NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501836>High-fat diet induces mouse  steatosis with a concomitant decline in energy metabolism: attenuation by eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or hydroxytyrosol (HT) supplementation and the additive effects upon EPA and HT co-administration.</a></h1><p>High-fat-diet (HFD) feeding is associated with  oxidative stress (OS), n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated  acid (n-3 LCPUFA) depletion, hepatic steatosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our hypothesis is that the HFD-induced  injury can be attenuated by the combined supplementation of n-3 LCPUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and the antioxidant hydroxytyrosol (HT). The C57BL/6J mice were administered an HFD (60% fat, 20% protein, 20% carbohydrates) or control diet (CD; 10% fat, 20% protein, 70% carbohydrates), with or without EPA (50 mg kg day), HT ( mg kg day), or EPA + HT (50 and  mg kg day, respectively) for 12 weeks. We measured the body and  weights and dietary and energy intakes along with  histology, FA composition, steatosis score and associated transcription factors, mitochondrial functions and metabolic factors related to energy sensing through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and PPAR-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) cascade. It was found that the HFD significantly induced  steatosis, with a 66% depletion of n-3 LCPUFAs and a 100% increase in n-6/n-3 LCPUFA ratio as compared to the case of CD (p < 0.05). These changes were concomitant with (i) a 95% higher lipogenic and 70% lower FA oxidation signaling, (ii) a 40% diminution in mitochondrial respiratory capacity and (iii) a 56% lower ATP content. HFD-induced  steatosis was also associated with (iv) a depressed mRNA expression of AMPK-PGC-1α signaling components, nuclear respiratory factor-2 (NRF-2) and β-ATP synthase. These HFD effects were significantly attenuated by the combined EPA + HT supplementation in an additive manner. These results suggested that EPA and HT co-administration partly prevented HFD-induced  steatosis, thus strengthening the importance of combined interventions in hepatoprotection in non-alcoholic  disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654131>Accuracy of  stiffness measurement and controlled attenuation parameter using FibroScan M/XL probes to diagnose  fibrosis and steatosis in patients with nonalcoholic  disease: a multicenter prospective study.</a></h1><p>Few studies have evaluated both  fibrosis and steatosis in patients with nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) using both FibroScan M and XL probes. This study was performed to investigate the accuracy of both FibroScan probes to diagnose  fibrosis and steatosis in patients with NAFLD.We prospectively enrolled 137 consecutive patients with clinically suspected NAFLD in our joint-research facilities.  biopsies,  stiffness measurements (LSMs), and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) measurements were performed, and 122 patients with NAFLD diagnosed pathologically by central pathologists were included in the final analysis.Reliable LSM results were obtained in 85.2% (M) and 89.3% (XL) of patients, and CAP was reliable in 90.2% (M) and 90.2% (XL). The median LSM was significantly lower with the XL than M probe, and CAP was significantly higher with the XL than M probe. The optimal cut-off values for diagnosing the fibrosis stage were lower for LSM with the XL than M probe (stage ≥ 2, 6.7 vs. 7.0; stage ≥ 3, 8.2 vs. 10.8; stage 4, 14.3 vs. 16.8, respectively), whereas those of CAP were higher for the XL than M probe (score of ≥ 2, 273 vs. 267; score of 3, 302 vs. 286, respectively). There were no significant differences in accuracy of the LSM and CAP between the probes. fibrosis and steatosis could be equally evaluated with FibroScan M and XL probes in patients with NAFLD. There was no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between the two probes using probe-specific cut-off values.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600212>Nutrigenomic effect of conjugated linoleic acid on growth and meat quality indices of growing rabbit.</a></h1><p>Conjugated linoleic acid was detected in rabbit caecotrophs, due to the presence of microbial lipid activity in rabbit cecum. However, the effect of CLA as a functional food in growing rabbit is not well established. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effect of CLA on production, meat quality, and its nutrigenomic effect on edible parts of rabbit carcass including skeletal muscle, , and adipose tissue. Therefore, seventy five weaned V-Line male rabbits, 30 days old, were randomly allocated into three dietary treatments receiving either basal control diet, diet supplemented with 0.% (CLAL), or 1% CLA (CLAH). Total experimental period (63 d) was segmented into 7 days adaptation and 56 days experimental period. Dietary supplementation of CLA did not alter growth performance, however, the fat percentage of longissimus lumborum muscle was decreased, with an increase in protein and polyunsaturated  acids (PUFA) percentage. Saturated  acids (SFA) and mono unsaturated  acids (MUFA) were not increased in CLA treated groups. There was tissue specific sensing of CLA, since subcutaneous adipose tissue gene expression of PPARA was downregulated, however, CPT1A tended to be upregulated in  of CLAL group only (P = 0.09). In skeletal muscle, FASN and PPARG were upregulated in CLAH group only (P ≤0.01). Marked cytoplasmic vacuolation was noticed in  of CLAH group without altering hepatocyte structure. Adipocyte size was decreased in CLA fed groups, in a dose dependent manner (P <0.01). Cell proliferation determined by PCNA was lower (P <0.01) in adipose tissue of CLA groups. Our data indicate that dietary supplementation of CLA (c9,t11-CLA and t10,c12- CLA) at a dose of 0.% in growing rabbit diet produce rabbit meat rich in PUFA and lower fat % without altering growth performance and hepatocyte structure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31488034> and  Protects Against High-Fat Diet-Induced Hepatic Steatosis by Enhancing Anti-Oxidation and AMPK Activation.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a chronic  disorder associated with features of metabolic syndrome and oxidative stress. We examined the mechanism by which the combined extracts of  and  extracts (ILF-RE) regulate hepatic dyslipidemia in an established NAFLD model, high-fat diet (HFD)-induced lipid dysmetabolism in rats. ILF-RE attenuated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) by 1.% , aspartate aminotransferase (AST) by 1.% , triglycerides by 1.% , cholesterol by 2.0% , and lipid peroxidation by 1.%  in the NAFLD model. ILF-RE, recently shown to have anti-oxidant properties, also inhibited hepatic ROS accumulation by 1.68%  and regulated ER-redox imbalance, a key phenomenon of ER stress. Due to nutrient overload stress-associated protein folding, ER stress and downstream SREBP-lipogenic transcription signaling were highly activated, and the mTORC1-AMPK axis was also disturbed, leading to hepatic steatosis. ILF-RE results in recovery from hepatic conditions induced by nutrient-based protein folding stress signaling and the ER stress-SREBP and AMPK-mTORC1-SREBP1 axes. Based on these results, ILF-RE is suggested to be a potential therapeutic strategy for hepatic steatosis and may represent a promising novel agent for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563903>Further Delineation of  Involvement in Girls and Women with Turner Syndrome: Case Report of a 2-Year-Old with  Dysfunction and Review of Patients Followed in the MassGeneral Hospital Turner Syndrome Clinic.</a></h1><p> function test (LFT) abnormalities, which may reflect underlying pathophysiology, are a well-known feature of Turner syndrome. Less frequently,  findings may include vascular changes and, rarely, severe  disease. Although previous studies on children and adolescents suggest a frequency of LFT abnormalities of up to 60%, less is known about the age at onset and natural history.We report a now 19-year-old young woman with Turner syndrome mosaicism with elevated transaminase levels first detected at the age of 2 years. We also present a retrospective analysis of 179 girls and women followed in the MassGeneral Hospital Turner Syndrome Clinic.In the index case, the severity of  function test abnormalities fluctuated without complete resolution from 2 to 18 years of age. In the full cohort of 179 patients, when lab results were available, elevated ALT levels occurred in 16 (11%) subjects of all ages, and in  (10%) patients ≤18 years of age. Significant and persistent ALT elevations occurred in 2 patients <10 years of age.The updated Clinical Practice Guidelines for the care of girls and women with Turner syndrome recommend annual  function tests throughout the lifespan, starting at the age of 10 years. Based on our data showing persistent elevation of at least one  enzyme, we recommend a prospective and more comprehensive study of  function in younger patients with Turner syndrome.

Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox models and pooled across databases by random effect meta-analyses.120 795 patients with recorded NAFLD or NASH diagnoses were identified with mean follow-up 2.1-. years. After adjustment for age and smoking the pooled hazard ratio for AMI was 1.17 (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.30; 1035 events in participants with NAFLD or NASH, 67 823 in matched controls). In a group with more complete data on risk factors (86 098 NAFLD and 4 664 988 matched controls), the hazard ratio for AMI after adjustment for systolic blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, total cholesterol level, statin use, and hypertension was 1.01 (0.91 to 1.12; 747 events in participants with NAFLD or NASH, 37 462 in matched controls). After adjustment for age and smoking status the pooled hazard ratio for stroke was 1.18 (1.11 to 1.24; 2187 events in participants with NAFLD or NASH, 134 001 in matched controls). In the group with more complete data on risk factors, the hazard ratio for stroke was 1.04 (0.99 to 1.09; 1666 events in participants with NAFLD, 83 882 in matched controls) after further adjustment for type 2 diabetes, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol level, statin use, and hypertension.The diagnosis of NAFLD in current routine care of 17.7 million patient appears not to be associated with AMI or stroke risk after adjustment for established cardiovascular risk factors. Cardiovascular risk assessment in adults with a diagnosis of NAFLD is important but should be done in the same way as for the general population.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

PCOS is a known risk factor for imaging-confirmed steatosis, and we now aim to evaluate whether PCOS influences histologic severity of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD).Retrospective study of women ages 18-45 years with biopsy-confirmed NAFLD between 2008-2019. Metabolic co-morbidities were captured within 6 months of biopsy. Histologic features of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were independently evaluated by two pathologists blinded to PCOS status.Among 102 women meeting study criteria, 36% (n=37) had PCOS; median age was 35 years; 27% were white, 6% black, 19% Asian, and 47% reported Hispanic ethnicity. Women with PCOS had higher LDL (123 vs 101 mg/dL, p=0.02) and BMI (38 vs 33 kg/cm , p<0.01). NASH was present in 76% of women with PCOS vs 66% without PCOS (p=0.3), and a higher proportion with PCOS had severe ballooning (32 vs 13%, p=0.02), presence of any fibrosis (84 vs 66%, p=0.06), and advanced fibrosis (16 vs 6%, p=0.10).

Despite the impact of this pathology in the population, nowadays there is no specific treatment for this disease, focusing its treatment on risks factors. However, it is imperative the existence of a specific treatment, due to this, the aim of this study was to determine the therapeutic effect of treatment with metformin, 4-hydroxychalcone or co-treatment on male Wistar rats with NAFLD. Wistar rats were divided into two groups with free access to either tap water or 50% sucrose (NAFLD) during 25 weeks. After 20 weeks of induction each were divided into four groups that received daily p.o. administration of: i) saline solution (1 ml); ii) metformin (200 mg/kg/day); iii) 4-hydroxychalcone (80 mg/kg/day) and i.v.) co-treatment (metformin plus 4-hydroxychalcone at the doses mentioned above), for  weeks. In healthy rats: metformin and co-treatment modified food and total caloric intake and induced diarrhea; but none of the treatments changed the other parameters evaluated. Meanwhile in rats with NAFLD: i) metformin inhibited hepatic total cholesterol and TGF-β, increased diarrhea frequency, and slightly decreased  steatosis, and fibrosis; ii) 4-hydroxychalcone decreased IL-6, TNF-α and TGF-β, increased IL-10, and markedly decreased  steatosis and fibrosis; and iii) co-treatment markedly decreased food intake, total caloric intake, and body weight, increased diarrhea; increased IL-10, showing and intermediate effect on decrease TNF-α, TGF-β,  steatosis and fibrosis. Our results showed that 4-hydroxychalcone treatment was the most effective among the treatments tested against NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Dual-photon microscopy allows automated quantification of fibrosis-related parameters (q-FPs) and may facilitate large-scale histological studies. We aim to validate the performance of q-FPs in a large histological cohort.344 patients with non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) underwent 428  biopsies (240 had paired transient elastography examination). Fibrosis stage was scored using the NASH Clinical Research Network system, and q-FPs were measured by dual-photon microscopy using unstained slides. Patients were randomly assigned to the training and validation cohorts to test the performance of individual q-FPs and derive optimal cut-offs.Over 25 q-FPs had area under the receiver-operating characteristics curves >0.90 for different fibrosis stages. Among them, the perimeter of collagen fibres and number of long collagen fibres had the highest accuracy. At the best cut-offs, the two q-FPs had 88.3%-96.2% sensitivity and 78.1%-91.1% specificity for different fibrosis stages in the validation cohort. q-FPs and histological scoring had nearly identical correlations with  stiffness measurement, suggesting that the accuracy of q-FPs approached that of histological assessment.

A high-fat diet (HFD)-induced T2DM rat model was established. The experimental rats were divided into the control group, HFD group, GM treatment group, DEX treatment group and GM + DEX treatment group. In addition, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor compound C (CC) was used to inhibit AMPKα1 expression. All rats received their respective treatment daily for 21 days. Blood glucose and lipid levels, apoptosis of hepatic cells, and levels of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress indicators in serum samples were evaluated. Protein expression of AMPKα1 and its downstream targets were also investigated. Results demonstrated that blood glucose concentration, blood lipid indicators (endothelin, total cholesterol, triglyceride and low density lipoprotein cholesterol), cell apoptosis in  tissues, total oxidant status, malondialdehyde, interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-1β levels in serum were increased in the high-fat group compared to the control but decreased following GM and/or DEX treatment. By contrast, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and antioxidative stress indicator superoxide dismutase (SOD) were decreased in the high-fat group but increased following GM and/or DEX treatment. Protein expression of AMPKα1 and the catabolic genes carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α and acyl coenzyme A were decreased whilst anabolic genes, including sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c,  acid synthase and diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2, were increased in the HFD group. These effects were attenuated by GM and/or DEX treatment. AMPKα1 inhibition resulted in decreased SOD and increased cell apoptosis in  tissues as well as increased IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β levels compared with the HFD group. However, these effects were abolished following treatment with CC, GM and DEX together. Taken together these results indicated that GM worked synergistically with DEX to attenuate symptoms of high-fat-induced T2DM, with the effect potentially involving an increase in AMPKα1 expression.Copyright: © Sun et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639282>Cadmium and nickel co-exposure exacerbates genotoxicity and not oxido-inflammatory stress in  and kidney of rats: Protective role of omega-3  acid.</a></h1><p>The present study examined the influence of co-exposure to cadmium (Cd) and nickel (Ni) on hepatorenal function as well as the protective role of omega-3 polyunsaturated  acids (ω-3FA) in rats.

The aim of this study was to investigate: (1) the association of somatotropic axis with cardiometabolic status; (2) the association of somatotropic axis with the Mediterranean diet and nutritional pattern in people with obesity. Cross-sectional observational study was carried out in 200 adult women, aged 36.98 ± 11.10 years with severe obesity (body mass index-BMI of 45.19 ± 6.30 kg/m). The adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the total calorie intake was assessed. Anthropometric measurements, body composition and biochemical profile were determined along with Growth Hormone (GH)/Insulin like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) axis and insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance-HoMA-IR). The enrolled subjects were compared after being divided according to GH peak response and according to IGF-1 standard deviation scores (SDS). Derangements of GH peak were detected in 61.% of studied patients while IGF-1 deficiency was detected in 71% of the population. Both blunted GH peak response and IGF-1 SDS were indicators of derangements of somatotropic axis and were associated with comparable results in terms of cardiometabolic sequelae. Both GH peak and IGF-1 levels were inversely associated with anthropometric and metabolic parameters.

Patient's characteristics and recurrence-free (RFS) and overall (OS) survival were compared between those with atypical- (well-differentiated-HCC ≥3 cm) and typical-HCC (moderate-to-poorly-differentiated HCC ≥3 cm).Of 176 patients included in this study, 37 (21%) had atypical-HCC. Patients with atypical-HCC were less likely to be Asian ethnicity (3% vs. 17%, p = 0.062), have lower rate of viral infection (14% vs. 43%, p = 0.003), cirrhosis (8% vs. 27%, p = 0.015). The tumors were less likely to demonstrate vascular invasion (30% vs. 59%, p = 0.002), and were associated with a lower alpha-fetoprotein level (3. ng/ml vs. 33.2 ng/ml, p < 0.001). Patients with atypical-HCC had a longer RFS (-y RFS: 58.3% vs. 35.7%, p = 0.016) and OS (-y OS: 79.1% vs 53.3%, p = 0.029) as compared to those with typical-HCC following univariate analysis, however this did not appear following multivariate analysis.Patients with atypical-HCC have different characteristic in terms of epidemiology, etiology, cirrhosis and vascular invasion as compared to typical-HCC. The etiology of atypical-HCC may be non-alcoholic  disease-related and/or malignant transformation of hepatocellular adenoma.Copyright © 2019 International Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association Inc.

We studied the association of body size-metabolic phenotype with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and significant fibrosis.Our cross-sectional study included 559 subjects (mean age of 53 years; women 51%) with biopsy-proven NAFLD. Clinical, genetic, and histological characteristic features of NAFLD were evaluated. The metabolically unhealthy phenotype was defined by the presence of two or more metabolic components, while body size was categorized based on body mass index: obese (≥ 25 kg/m) or non-obese (< 25 kg/m). Body size-metabolic phenotypes were divided into four study groups: (1) non-obese metabolic syndrome (MS)-, (2) non-obese MS+ , (3) obese MS-, and (4) obese MS+.Obese MS- and non-obese MS+ groups demonstrated comparable levels of insulin resistance, adipose tissue insulin resistance indexes, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) areas. The VAT area was significantly higher in the obese MS+ group versus obese MS- group. However, the VAT to subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) ratio was highest in the non-obese MS+ group. There was no difference in histology between the non-obese MS+, obese MS-, and obese MS+ groups. Multivariate analyses adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, PNPLA3, TM6SF2, and VAT/SAT areas demonstrated an independent and dose-dependent relationship between the body size-metabolic phenotype and NASH or significant fibrosis.The non-obese MS+ group displayed similar degree of hepatic histological severity compared to their obese MS- counterparts.

Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) supplementation reduces fructose-induced non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study was to determine the role of FGF21 and underlying mechanisms in the protective effects of LGG.FGF21 knockout (KO) mice and C57BL/6 wild type (WT) mice were fed 30% fructose for 12 weeks. LGG was administered to the mice in the last 4 weeks during fructose feeding. FGF21-adiponectin (ADPN)-mediated hepatic lipogenesis and inflammation were investigated.FGF21 expression was robustly increased after -weeks of feeding and significantly decreased after 12-weeks of feeding in fructose-induced NAFLD mice. LGG administration reversed the depressed FGF21 expression, increased adipose production of ADPN, and reduced hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation in the WT mice but not in the KO mice. Hepatic nuclear carbohydrate responsive-element binding protein (ChREBP) was increased by fructose and reduced by LGG, resulting in a reduction in the expression of lipogenic genes. The methylated form of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) C, which dephosphorylates and activates ChREBP, was upregulated by fructose and normalized by LGG. Leucine carboxyl methyltransferase-1, which methylates PP2AC, was also increased by fructose and decreased by LGG. However, those beneficial effects of LGG were blunted in the KO mice. Hepatic dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate, which inhibits PP2A, was markedly increased by LGG in the WT mice but attenuated in the KO mice. LGG decreased adipose hypertrophy and increased serum levels of ADPN, which regulates sphingosine metabolism. This beneficial effect was decreased in the KO mice.LGG administration increases hepatic FGF21 expression and serum ADPN concentration, resulting in a reduced ChREBP activation through dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate-mediated PP2A deactivation, and subsequently reversed fructose-induced NAFLD. Thus, our data suggest that FGF21 is required for the beneficial effects of LGG in reversal of fructose-induced NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Methyl ferulic acid (MFA) is a biologically active monomer isolated from the root of  Hasskarl. It has been reported that MFA has a hepatoprotective effect against alcohol-induced  injury  and . However, the effect of MFA on ethanol-induced insulin resistance in ALD remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether MFA could exert protective effects against hepatic insulin resistance in ethanol-induced L-02 cells and ALD rats. ALD was induced in vivo by feeding Lieber-DeCarli diet containing % (w/v) alcohol for 16 weeks to Sprague-Dawley rats. Insulin resistance was induced  in human hepatocyte L-02 cells with 200 mM ethanol for 24 h followed by 10-7 nM insulin for 30 min. MFA exhibited the effects of inhibited insulin resistance, reduced enzymatic capacity for hepatic gluconeogenesis, and increased hepatic glycogen synthesis both  and . In addition, the results of transcriptome sequencing of  tissues in the ethanol- and MFA-treated groups indicated that "pyruvate metabolism," "glycolysis/gluconeogenesis," and " acid metabolism" were significantly different between ethanol- and MFA-treated groups. Further studies suggested that MFA activated the hepatic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway  and . Taken together, these findings suggested that MFA effectively ameliorated hepatic insulin resistance in ALD at least partially by acting on the PI3K/AKT pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31565961>Unravelling  haemorrhagic syndrome: 1. Oestrogen and inflammation.</a></h1><p>Previous studies have implicated oestrogen as a factor in the induction of  haemorrhagic syndrome (FLHS). In this study, a refined laying hen model was employed to permit further investigations. Intramuscular (i.m.) injections of exogenous oestrogen as β-estradiol-17-dipropionate (E) ( mg/kg BW) were given every 4 days for 20 days to 30-week-old hens fed either  or with restricted feed intake. Elevated (< 0.01) plasma oestrogen concentrations produced significant macroscopic and microscopic hepatic alterations. Hens in the E-treated  fed (EAL) group experienced a higher incidence of FLHS than hens in the E-treated restricted feed intake group, showing that birds with a higher feed intake are more at risk of developing FLHS. Histological examination of livers revealed that hens in the E-treated  fed group had consistent and severe fat infiltration in the , and fat vacuolization within hepatocytes. Fat accumulation and fat droplets were found not only in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes but also in  sinusoids. White blood cell counts and fibrinogen concentrations were altered (< 0.01) in hens treated with E when compared with controls. Plasma fibrinogen concentrations were altered over time, and correlated with white blood cell counts (Pearson's correlation  = 0.96; 0.001). Hens treated with E had increased (0.01) levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, confirming that E induced hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia. It was concluded that E successfully induced FLHS in hens, with typical systemic and hepatic events resulting from a disturbance in lipid metabolism and chronic low-grade inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671589>Effects of Periodic Fasting on  Index-A Prospective Observational Study.</a></h1><p>This prospective observational trial investigated effects and safety of periodic fasting in subjects with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

A baseline FLI ≥ 60 (the threshold for ) was found in 264 subjects (37.9%). The mean duration of fasting was 8. ± 4.0 days (range 6-38). FLI decreased significantly (-14.02 ± 11.67;  < 0.0001), with a larger effect in individuals with T2DM (-19.15 ± 11.0;  < 0.0001;  = 0.002 compared to non-diabetic subjects). Body mass index (BMI) decreased by -1.51 ± 0.82 kg/m, and 49.9% of the subjects lost ≥% body weight. After fasting, nearly half of the 264 subjects with FLI ≥ 60 (highest risk category) shifted to a lower category. The improvement of FLI correlated with the number of fasting days (r = -0.20,  < 0.0001) and with the magnitude of BMI reduction (r = 0.14,  = 0.0001).

This prospective observational study was conducted to examine the incidence and clinical outcomes of clinical and subclinical AKI in MDR septic patients receiving CMS.Forty-two MDR septic patients with normal sCr who required CMS were included. Clinical AKI was diagnosed by increased sCr levels according to the KDIGO2012 criteria while subclinical AKI was identified by elevated levels of urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL > 150 ng/mL) or urinary -type -acid-binding protein (uL-FABP > 10. ng/mL).Clinical AKI was noted in 47.6% of patients on day  and 38.1% on day 7 after initiating CMS. By using uL-FABP, subclinical AKI was observed in 45.2% and 54.8% on day  and 7, respectively. At baseline prior to CMS treatment, subclinical AKI was already present in 90%. The baseline uL-FABP was superior to the baseline uNGAL in early prediction of clinical AKI on day . The subclinical AKI patients had comparable worse outcomes as clinical AKI patients.The incidence of subclinical AKI in MDR septic patients before CMS treatment was extremely high. The baseline uL-FABP provided the best predictive capacity of clinical AKI. The causes of clinical AKI might include the persistence of sepsis process, subclinical AKI and CMS nephrotoxicity. Proper management of subclinical AKI patients before CMS initiation should be concerned to prevent further renal damage and improve patient and renal outcomes.© 2019 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31523515>Nicotinamide riboside exerts protective effect against aging-induced NAFLD-like hepatic dysfunction in mice.</a></h1><p>Aging is one of the risk factors of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). Yet, the mechanism underlying the aging-associated NAFLD-like syndrome is not fully understood. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), a ubiquitous coenzyme, has protective effects against aging. Here, we investigated the actions of NAD precursors nicotinamide riboside (NR) on the development of aging-induced NAFLD.NR supplemented food (2. g/kg food) was applied to aged mice for three months while normal chow to the other groups. Body weight, food intake,  weight and fat pat mass were measured. The serum concentrations of lipid content, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and NAD were determined by biochemical assays. Pathological assessment and immunohistochemistry analysis of hepatic tissues were used to evaluate the effect of NR on NAFLD development and inflammatory infiltration.NR repletion significantly reduced fat pat mass in aged mice, while not altered the body weight, food intake, and  weight. NR repletion significantly rescued the NAD reduction in aged mice. The total cholesterol and triglyceride levels could be lowered by NR repletion in aged mice. The AST level was also significantly reduced by NR repletion in aged group, while the ALT level lowered but without significance. Notably, moderate NAFLD phenotypes, including steatosis and hepatic fibrosis could be markedly corrected by NR repletion. In addition, Kupffer cells accumulated and inflammatory infiltration could also be remarkably reversed by NR repletion in aged mice.Aging was associated with NAFLD-like phenotypes in mice, which could be reversed by oral NR repletion.

The aim of this study was to establish how reliable this strategy is to predict changes in  histology in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).Patients with NASH who had participated in our prior randomized controlled trials of pioglitazone with complete paired data for IHTG content by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and  histology were included in the study.A total of 121 patients were included. Changes in IHTG were assessed in several ways: as a continuous variable (correlations), as categorical groups (IHTG change ≥0%; or IHTG reduction of 1-30%; 31-50%; 51-70%; or >70%), and in a binomial way as steatosis resolution or not (defined as achieving IHTG <.56%). Changes in IHTG correlated with steatosis on histology (r = 0.54; p <0.01). However, the magnitude of IHTG reduction was not associated with the rate of response of the primary histological outcome (2-point improvement in the NAFLD activity score from 2 different parameters, without worsening of fibrosis) or resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis, neither in patients receiving pioglitazone nor placebo. Changes in lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, or  fibrosis were also independent of changes in IHTG, irrespective of treatment arm. Steatosis resolution was not associated with better histological outcomes either.Changes in IHTG predict changes in steatosis but not of other  histological parameters. This implies that IHTG response to treatment should be interpreted with caution, as it may not be as reliable as previously believed to predict a treatment's overall clinical efficacy in patients with NASH.Quantification of  fat by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently used to assess treatment responses in patients with , with the assumption that improvements in  fat translate into less inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis in the . However, in this article, we showed that changes in  fat do not necessarily translate into changes in these parameters. This means that MRI may not be as useful to assess treatment response in patients with  as previously believed.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the . Published by Elsevier B.V.

They are associated with severe endocrine-metabolic complications with significant morbidity and mortality. In the pathogenesis of the acquired forms, immunological disorders may be involved.A 13-year-old female was diagnosed with acquired generalized lipodystrophy and observed for suspicion of portal hypertension. She presented with generalized absence of adipose tissue, cervical and axillary acanthosis nigricans, and massive hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests revealed AST 116 IU/L, ALT 238 IU/L, GGT 114 IU/L, HOMA-IR 28.2, triglycerides 491 mg/L, and leptin < 0.05 ng/mL. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy saw no signs of portal hypertension. Hepatic histology showed macrovesicular  infiltration (60% of hepatocytes) and advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis. Her clinical condition worsened progressively to diabetes requiring treatment with subcutaneous insulin and hepatopulmonary syndrome.A 15-year-old female, diagnosed with acquired partial lipodystrophy, Parkinson syndrome, autoimmune thyroiditis, and autoimmune thrombocytopenia was observed for hypertransaminasemia since the age of 8 years. She had absence of subcutaneous adipose tissue in the upper and lower limbs and ataxia. Laboratory tests showed AST 461 IU/L, ALT 921 IU/L, GGT 145 IU/L, HOMA-IR 32.6, triglycerides 298 mg/dL, normal leptin levels, platelets 84,000/μL, IgG 1,894 mg/dL, positive anti-LKM and anti-LC-1. Hepatic histology was suggestive of autoimmune hepatitis, without steatosis. She progressed favorably under metformin and immunosuppressive treatment.Early recognition and adequate characterization of  disease in lipodystrophies is essential for a correct treatment approach.

Although neonicotinoids display a high specificity for insects, their use has been recently debated since several studies led to the hypothesis that they may have adverse ecological effects and potential risks to mammals and even humans. Due to their hydrophobic nature, neonicotinoids need specific carriers to allow their distribution in body fluids. Human serum albumin (HSA), the most abundant plasma protein, is a key carrier of endogenous and exogenous compounds. The in silico docking and ligand binding properties of acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, nitenpyram, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam to HSA are here reported. Neonicotinoids bind to multiple  acid (FA) binding sites, preferentially to the FA1 pocket, with high affinity. Values of the dissociation equilibrium constant for neonicotinoid binding FA1 of HSA (i.e.,  K ) derived from in silico docking simulations (ranging between 3.9 × 10 and 6.3 × 10 M) agree with those determined experimentally from competitive inhibition of heme-Fe(III) binding (i.e.,  K ; ranging between 2.1 × 10 and 6.9 × 10 M). Accounting for the HSA concentration in vivo (~7. 10 M), values of K here determined suggest that the formation of the HSA:neonicotinoid complexes may occur in vivo. Therefore, HSA appears to be an important determinant for neonicotinoid transport and distribution to tissues and organs, particularly to the  where they are metabolized.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31487539>GR and Foxa1 promote the transcription of ANGPTL4 in bovine adipocytes.</a></h1><p>ANGPTL4 (angiopoietin-like 4) is a secreted protein involved in triacylglycerol homeostasis.

Two transcription factors, GR and Foxa1, were identified and considered as important transcriptional activators of ANGPTL4 by mutational analysis and RNA interference assays in combination with electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) in bovines. In conclusion, GR and Foxa1 were determined to be responsible for the regulation of ANGPTL4 transcription. Our results may provide a basis for further investigation of ANGPTL4 regulation and a reference for improvement of beef quality in cattle.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity study, adult weight change was calculated with recalled body weight at age 20 years and measured body weight at middle age. Measures of insulin resistance were calculated using both fasting and postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations. Visceral fat was assessed by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and  fat by proton-MR spectroscopy ( = 1758). We examined the association between adult weight change and insulin resistance with linear regression, adjusted for confounding factors. To investigate mediation, we additionally adjusted for total body fat, visceral fat, and  fat. In participants who gained ≥50% of body weight during adulthood, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was 3.22 (95% CI 2.76; 3.77) times higher than in weight maintainers. In a joint model, total body fat mediated this association for 8.1% (95% CI -9.2; 25.4), visceral fat for 32.0% (18.6; 45.4%) and  fat for 22.% (15.0; 30.1). The association between adult weight gain and insulin resistance at middle age is largely mediated by both visceral fat and  fat.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31482482>Safety and Utility of  Biopsy During Bariatric Surgery in the New Zealand Setting.</a></h1><p>Asymptomatic  disease is common in bariatric patients and can be diagnosed with intraoperative biopsy. This study aimed to establish the risk-benefit profile of routine  biopsy, prevalence of clinically significant  disease, relationship between  pathology and body mass index, and compare outcomes between ethnic groups.This retrospective cohort study included all patients who had index bariatric surgery at Auckland City Hospital between 2009 and 2016. Diagnosis of  disease was based on intraoperative biopsy histology. Outcomes included safety (biopsy-related complication) and utility ( pathology meeting criteria for referral).  pathology and referral rates were compared between ethnic groups.Of 335 bariatric surgery patients, 234 (70%) underwent intraoperative  biopsy. There were no biopsy-related complications. Histological findings were as follows: normal 25/234 (11%), non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) 207/234 (88%), and other pathological findings in 35/234 (15%). Histological finding meeting referral criteria was present in 22/234 (9%). Of these, 12/22 (55%) were referred. Number needed to biopsy to identify histology meeting referral criteria: n = 11. Māori had a similar NAFLD rate to non-Māori [51/56 versus 156/178, p = 0.48]. Pasifika patients had a higher rate than non-Pasifika [39/40 versus 168/194, p = 0.049].

A total of 80 C57BL/6J Narl mice were randomly divided into five groups: 3-month-old group, 9-month-old group, 14-month-old group, 20-month-old group, and FTZ treatment group (20 months old). The mice in the treatment group received a therapeutic dose of oral FTZ extract (1.0 g/kg, on raw material weight basis) once daily during the experiment. The other groups received the corresponding volume of oral normal saline solution.  samples of all five groups were collected after 12 weeks, and UPLC-Q-TOF/MS was used to analyze metabolic changes. Orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was used to analyze the resulting data. Additionally, cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), secretion levels of TNF-α, IL-6, -LOX, and COX-2, as well as their relative mRNA expression in the  were determined.  The levels of TC, TG, AST, and ALT were increased, and  tissue structure was damaged. The secretion levels of TNF-α, IL-6, -LOX, and COX-2, as well as their relative mRNA expression in the  also increased with aging. FTZ administration reduced the symptoms of  aging. The OPLS-DA score plot illustrated the effect of FTZ against  aging, with N-acetyl-leukotriene E4, 20-hydroxy-leukotriene E4, leukotriene E4, and arachidonic acid among the key biomarkers. The pivotal pathways revealed by pathway analysis included arachidonic acid metabolism and biosynthesis of unsaturated  acids. The mechanism by which FTZ reduces the symptoms of  aging in mice might be related to disorders of the abovementioned pathways.  A metabolomic approach based on UPLC-Q-TOF/MS and multivariate statistical analysis was successfully applied to investigate the metabolic trajectory of  aging. FTZ has a protective effect against  aging, which may be mediated  interference with the metabolism of arachidonic acid, biosynthesis of unsaturated  acids, and downregulation of pro-inflammatory factors in the  in mice .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31514755>Increased  echogenicity and  enzymes are associated with extreme obesity, adolescent age and male gender: analysis from the German/Austrian/Swiss obesity registry APV.</a></h1><p>Childhood obesity is often associated with non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), the most common chronic  disease in pediatrics.This multi-center study analyzed  echogenicity and  enzymes in relation to obesity, age, gender and comorbidities.

Blood was sampled every 6 h to detect NGAL, Kim-1, L-FABP, and serum creatinine (SCr) concentrations. Kidney tissue of two dogs was taken before the injection, as soon as SCr was elevated (78 μmol/L), and when it had risen to 1. times the baseline, and haematoxylin-eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to observe changes.NGAL, Kim-1, and SCr levels were significantly increased (P < 0.05) at 18, 30, and 78 h post injection, but L-FABP concentration was not associated with renal injury. At the earliest SCr elevation stage, findings were mild oedema, degeneration, and vacuolisation in renal tubular epithelial cells in pathology, and mild cytoplasmic and mitochondrial oedema in TEM. At this time point, NGAL and Kim-1 concentrations were significantly increased (P < 0.05), indicating that these two molecules biomark early kidney injury in dogs.

Purpose To investigate a deep learning-based automated  fat quantification tool at nonenhanced CT for establishing the prevalence of steatosis in a large screening cohort. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a fully automated  segmentation algorithm was applied to noncontrast abdominal CT examinations from consecutive asymptomatic adults by using three-dimensional convolutional neural networks, including a subcohort with follow-up scans. Automated volume-based  attenuation was analyzed, including conversion to CT fat fraction, and compared with manual measurement in a large subset of scans. Results A total of 11 669 CT scans in 9552 adults (mean age ± standard deviation, 57.2 years ± 7.9; 5314 women and 4238 men; median body mass index [BMI], 27.8 kg/m) were evaluated, including 2117 follow-up scans in 1862 adults (mean age, 59.2 years; 971 women and 891 men; mean interval, . years). Algorithm failure occurred in seven scans. Mean CT  attenuation was 55 HU ± 10, corresponding to CT fat fraction of 6.4% (slightly fattier in men than in women [7.4% ± 6.0 vs .8% ± .7%;  < .001]). Mean  Hounsfield unit varied little by age (<4 HU difference among all age groups) and only weak correlation was seen with BMI ( = 0.14). By category, 47.9% (5584 of 11 669) had negligible or no  fat (CT fat fraction <%), 42.4% (4948 of 11 669) had mild steatosis (CT fat fraction of %-14%), 8.8% (1025 of 11 669) had moderate steatosis (CT fat fraction of 14%-28%), and 1% (112 of 11 669) had severe steatosis (CT fat fraction >28%). Excellent agreement was seen between automated and manual measurements, with a mean difference of 2.7 HU (median, 3 HU) and  of 0.92. Among the subcohort with longitudinal follow-up, mean change was only -3 HU ± 9, but 43.3% (806 of 1861) of patients changed steatosis category between first and last scans. Conclusion This fully automated CT-based  fat quantification tool allows for population-based assessment of hepatic steatosis and nonalcoholic  disease, with objective data that match well with manual measurement. The prevalence of at least mild steatosis was greater than 50% in this asymptomatic screening cohort.© RSNA, 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647808>Causal relationships between obesity and the leading causes of death in women and men.</a></h1><p>Obesity traits are causally implicated with risk of cardiometabolic diseases. It remains unclear whether there are similar causal effects of obesity traits on other non-communicable diseases. Also, it is largely unexplored whether there are any sex-specific differences in the causal effects of obesity traits on cardiometabolic diseases and other leading causes of death. We constructed sex-specific genetic risk scores (GRS) for three obesity traits; body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and WHR adjusted for BMI, including 565, 324, and 337 genetic variants, respectively. These GRSs were then used as instrumental variables to assess associations between the obesity traits and leading causes of mortality in the UK Biobank using Mendelian randomization. We also investigated associations with potential mediators, including smoking, glycemic and blood pressure traits. Sex-differences were subsequently assessed by Cochran's Q-test (Phet). A Mendelian randomization analysis of 228,466 women and 195,041 men showed that obesity causes coronary artery disease, stroke (particularly ischemic), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, type 2 and 1 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic  disease, chronic  disease, and acute and chronic renal failure. Higher BMI led to higher risk of type 2 diabetes in women than in men (Phet = 1.4×10-). Waist-hip-ratio led to a higher risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Phet = 3.7×10-6) and higher risk of chronic renal failure (Phet = 1.0×10-4) in men than women. Obesity traits have an etiological role in the majority of the leading global causes of death. Sex differences exist in the effects of obesity traits on risk of type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal failure, which may have downstream implications for public health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599882>INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR BINDING PROTEIN-1, NON-ALCOHOLIC  DISEASE, AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH FRUCTOSE CONSUMPTION IN CHILDREN WITH OBESITY.</a></h1><p>Over consumption of added sugar is associated with obesity, non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), and insulin resistance (IR).The objective of the study was to study the insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) and NAFLD and their relationship with fructose consumption in children with obesity.A cross-sectional study was carried out in children 6-11 years old with obesity. Anthropometric measurements, fructose consumption, glucose, lipid profile, insulin, and IGFBP-1 levels were evaluated; the homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) was used. NAFLD was evaluated by ultrasound.We studied 83 children with a mean age of 9.2 ± 1.3 years. About 93% of the girls presented IR and lower levels of IGFBP-1 (p = 0.0001). The group with the lower levels of IGFBP-1 had higher HOMA-IR (p = 0.000002); IGFBP-1 was associated with fructose consumption (r = -0.25; p = 0.03), body mass index (BMI) (r=-0.42; p = 0.02), and HOMA-IR (r=-0.61; p = 0.002). About 81% of the children were classified as having mild or moderate/severe NAFLD, and these groups had higher HOMA-IR (p = 0.036) and fructose consumption (p = 0.0014).The girls had more metabolic alterations. The group with lower levels of IGFBP-1 (hepatic IR) was associated with higher BMI, HOMA-IR, and fructose consumption; the group with higher severity of NAFLD showed higher HOMA-IR and fructose consumption.Copyright: © 2019 Permanyer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626206>[Evaluation of the effect of remaxol on hepatocytes in non-alcoholic  dystrophy modeling in laboratory C57BL/6 mice].</a></h1><p>To provide a morphological evaluation of the effectiveness of incorporating remaxol into a treatment regimen for non-alcoholic  disease.The investigation was conducted using 32 male C57BL/6 mice weighing 35-44 g, which were divided into 4 groups.

HepG2 cells were treated with free  acid (FFA) mixture (oleic acid: palmitic acid, 2:1) for 24 h to stimulate in vitro . In addition, C57BL/6 mice were fed 60 kcal% high-fat (HF) diet for eight weeks to induce  in vivo. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) productions were increased by FFA and HF-diet, but supplementation with CLW significantly decreased these levels. CLW treatment ameliorated antioxidant activities that were suppressed by exposure to the FFA and HF-diet. Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and  acid transport proteins (FATP2 and FATP5) were increased in HF-diet groups, while CLW suppressed their expression levels. Moreover, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), and  acid synthase (FAS) expression levels were down-regulated in the CLW groups compared to HF-diet groups. On the other hand, ' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1) expressions were up-regulated in the CLW groups. HF-diet fed mice showed high hepatic triglycerides (TG) content compared to the normal diet mice. However, the administration of CLW restored the hepatic TG level, indicating an inhibitory effect against lipid accumulation by CLW.

The expression of lipid metabolism‑associated genes was measured using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR (RT‑qPCR). The effects of DADS on the gut microbiome were measured using 16S recombinant (r)DNA gene analysis. The results revealed that the serum non‑esterified free  acids, high density lipoprotein‑cholesterol, low density lipoprotein‑cholesterol, serum total cholesterol,  triglyceride and total cholesterol levels of the mice fed with a low‑dose of DADS was significantly higher when compared with the control. Hematoxylin and eosin and oil‑red O staining demonstrated that DADS induced  in mice. The results of the RT‑qPCR revealed that the expression levels of a number of lipid metabolism‑associated genes were altered in the livers of mice treated with DADS. The 16S rDNA gene analysis demonstrated that the mice fed on a normal diet treated with a low‑dose of DADS had decreased levels of bacteria from the Bacteroidetes phyla and increased levels of bacteria from the Firmicutes phyla.

However, it does not have validated reliability criteria. We tested the reliability of a different number of measurements in patients with chronic  disease and explored whether the application of quality criteria improves the diagnostic performance. All patients underwent  stiffness assessment (LSM) with ElastPQ and Fibroscan (F-TE). The mean, median, standard deviation (SD) and interquartile range (IQR) of 10,  and 3 measurements were retrospectively collected for each patient and compared to each other.  histology was available in a subset of patients. Overall, 400 patients met the inclusion criteria. Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) was the most represented etiology (75 %), followed by primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The correlation of medians was significantly better between 10 and  measurements than between 10 and 3. The difference of medians was significant only in the comparison between 10 and 3 measurements. The correlation between ElastPQ and F-TE was equally good for 10 and  measurements and significantly improved after an IQR/median ≤ 30 % was applied. The diagnostic performance of ElastPQ was better with the median value of 10 and  measurements and improved if LSM values were obtained with IQR/M ≤ 30 %. The median value of  valid LSMs suffices for the reliable estimation of  stiffness using ElastPQ.

Participants were considered "NAFLD aware" if they reported being told previously by a doctor or nurse that they had "."NAFLD prevalence was 23.9%. Only 16 of 667 (2.4%) participants with CT-defined NAFLD were aware of a NAFLD diagnosis. NAFLD aware participants were more likely to be white (81.3% vs. 53.%, p = 0.03) and have the metabolic syndrome (87.% vs. 59.3%, p = 0.02) and/or hypertension (75.0% vs. 50.2%, p = 0.05). In multivariable analyses adjusted for demographics, metabolic syndrome and hypertension remained predictive of NAFLD awareness.There is low awareness of NAFLD among individuals with hepatic steatosis on imaging, even among those with metabolic risk factors.

Survey results were discussed as a group before voting.Current measures of disease activity and fibrosis may not fully capture important features of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Alternative methods to evaluate ballooning degeneration are needed. Panellists were uncertain whether portal inflammation, degree of steatosis and Mallory-Denk bodies are important measures of disease activity. Furthermore, it was felt that current staging systems do not capture the full spectrum of fibrosis in NASH. A consensus definition and sub-stages for bridging fibrosis are needed. The severity of perisinusoidal fibrosis should be captured at all stages. Lastly, a method to evaluate features of fibrosis regression should be developed.The operating properties of the modifications proposed should be evaluated prospectively to determine reliability and responsiveness.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31482382>Association between nonalcoholic  disease and cardiac function and structure-a meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic  disease is increasingly recognized as the hepatic counterpart of metabolic syndrome. It is hypothesized that structural and functional cardiac changes may be associated with this metabolic disease. We aimed to gather the existing information on the association of nonalcoholic  disease with cardiac alterations, and to evaluate a possible correlation between them.Systematic review of Medline searching results for original articles studying NAFLD and cardiac parameters until August 2018. A meta-analysis was conducted to each parameter of cardiac structure and function selected, using Review Manager .3 software. This study was conducted according to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA).A total of 16 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. There was a significant association between nonalcoholic  disease and (1) higher left ventricle mass and ratios between left ventricle mass and both height and body surface area; (2) higher LVEDD; (3) higher left atrium diameter and ratio between left atrial volume and body surface area; (4) higher posterior wall and septum thickness; () lower E/A wave ratio; (6) higher E/E' ratio; (7) longer deceleration time and (8) longer relaxation time.NAFLD associates with adverse structural alterations and cardiac dysfunction.

We aimed to explore the role of MGL in the development of cholestatic  and bile duct injury in mouse models of sclerosing cholangitis (SC), a disease so far lacking effective pharmacological therapy. To this aim we analyzed the effects of 3,-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) feeding to induce SC in wild type (WT) and knockout (MGL ) mice and tested pharmacological inhibition with JZL184 in the Mdr2 mouse model of SC. Cholestatic  injury and fibrosis were assessed by serum biochemistry,  histology, gene expression and western blot characterization of BA and FA synthesis/transport. Moreover, intestinal FAs and fecal microbiome were analyzed. Transfection and silencing were performed in Caco2 cells. MGL mice were protected from DDC-induced biliary fibrosis and inflammation with reduced serum  enzymes, increased FA/BA metabolism and β-oxidation. Notably, pharmacological (JZL184) inhibition of MGL ameliorated cholestatic injury in DDC-fed WT mice and protected Mdr2 from spontaneous  injury, with improved  enzymes, inflammation and biliary fibrosis. In vitro experiments confirmed that silencing of MGL decreases prostaglandin E2 accumulation in the intestine upregulating peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) -α and -γ activity, thus reducing inflammation. Conclusions: Collectively, our study unravels MGL as a novel metabolic target, demonstrating that MGL inhibition may be considered as potential therapy for SC.© 2019 The Authors.

Even though high-density lipoprotein (HDL), a CVD protective marker, is decreased, whether HDL metabolism and function are perturbed in NAFLD are currently unknown. We examined the effect of NAFLD and disease severity on HDL metabolism and function in patients with biopsy-proven simple steatosis (SS), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and healthy controls. HDL turnover and HDL protein dynamics in SS ( = 7), NASH ( = 8), and healthy controls ( = 9) were studied in vivo. HDL maturation and remodeling, antioxidant, cholesterol efflux properties, and activities of lecithin-cholesterol ester acyltransferase and cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) were quantified using in vitro assays. All patients with NAFLD had increased turnover of both HDL cholesterol (HDLc; 0.16 ± 0.09 vs. 0.34 ± 0.18 days,  < 0.05) and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoAI) (0.26 ± 0.04 vs. 0.34 ± 0.06 days,  < 0.005) compared with healthy controls. The fractional catabolic rates of other HDL proteins, including ApoAII (and ApoAIV) were higher ( < 0.05) in patients with NAFLD who also had higher CETP activity, ApoAI/HDLc ratio ( < 0.05). NAFLD-induced alterations were associated with lower antioxidant (114.2 ± 46.6 vs. 220. ± 48.2 nmol·mL·min) but higher total efflux properties of HDL (23.4 ± 1.3% vs. 25. ± 2.3%) (both  < 0.05), which was more pronounced in individuals with NASH. However, no differences were observed in either HDL turnover, antioxidant, and cholesterol efflux functions of HDL or HDL proteins' turnover between subjects with SS and subjects with NASH. Thus, HDL metabolism and function are altered in NAFLD without any significant differences between SS and NASH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595205>Pyroptosis in  Disease: New Insights into Disease Mechanisms.</a></h1><p>There has been increasing interest in pyroptosis as a novel form of pro-inflammatory programmed cell death. The mechanism of pyroptosis is significantly different from other forms of cell death in its morphological and biochemical features. Pyroptosis is characterized by the activation of two different types of caspase enzymes-caspase-1 and caspase-4//11, and by the occurrence of a proinflammatory cytokine cascade and an immune response. Pyroptosis participates in the immune defense mechanisms against intracellular bacterial infections. On the other hand, excessive inflammasome activation can induce sterile inflammation and eventually cause some diseases, such as acute or chronic hepatitis and  fibrosis. The mechanism and biological significance of this novel form of cell death in different  diseases will be evaluated in this review. Specifically, we will focus on the role of pyroptosis in alcoholic and non-alcoholic  disease, as well as in  failure. Finally, the therapeutic implications of pyroptosis in  diseases will be discussed.Copyright: © 2019 Wu et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662026>Adapting a Prediction Rule for Metabolic Syndrome Risk Assessment Suitable for Developing Countries.</a></h1><p> Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of cardiometabolic disturbances that increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The early identification of high-risk individuals is the key for halting these conditions. The world is facing a growing epidemic MetS although the magnitude in Egypt is unknown.  To describe MetS and its determinants among apparently healthy individuals residing in urban and rural communities in Egypt and to establish a model for MetS prediction.  A cross-sectional study was conducted with 270 adults from rural and urban districts in Alexandria, Egypt. Participants were clinically evaluated and interviewed for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and dietary habits. MetS was defined according to the harmonized criteria set by the AHA/NHLBI. The risk of ischemic heart diseases (IHDs), DM and  were assessed using validated risk prediction charts. A multiple risk model for predicting MetS was developed, and its performance was compared.  In total, 57.8% of the study population met the criteria for MetS and were at high risk for developing IHD, DM, and . Silent CVD risk factors were identified in 20.4% of the participants. In our proposed multivariate logistic regression model, the predictors of MetS were obesity [OR (95% CI) = 16.3 (6.03-44.0)], morbid obesity [OR (95% CI) = 21.7 (.3-88.0)], not working [OR (95% CI) = 2.05 (1.1-3.8)], and having a family history of chronic diseases [OR (95% CI) = 4.38 (2.23-8.61)]. Consumption of caffeine once per week protected against MetS by 27.8-fold. The derived prediction rule was accurate in predicting MetS, , high risk of DM, and, to a lesser extent, a 10-year lifetime risk of IHD.  Central obesity and sedentary lifestyles are accountable for the rising rates of MetS in our society. Interventions are needed to minimize the potential predisposition of the Egyptian population to cardiometabolic diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623522>The Triglyceride Paradox Is Related to Lipoprotein Size, Visceral Adiposity and Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase Activity in Black Versus White Women.</a></h1><p> In black women, triglycerides are paradoxically normal in the presence of insulin resistance. This relationship may be explained by race-related differences in central adiposity and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) enzyme activity index.  In a cross-sectional study, to compare fasting and postprandial triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particle (TRLP) concentrations and size in black compared to white pre- and post-menopausal women and determine the relationship between TRLP subfractions and whole-body insulin sensitivity, hepatic and visceral fat, and SCD-1 levels.  In 122 federally employed women without diabetes, 73 black (58 African American and 15 African immigrant) and 49 white; age 44{plus minus}10 (mean{plus minus}SD); BMI 30.0{plus minus}.6 kg/m2 we measured lipoprotein subfractions using nuclear magnetic resonance. Hepatic fat was measured by proton MRS, insulin sensitivity index (SI) calculated by minimal modeling from a frequently-sampled intravenous glucose test, RBC  acid profiles by gas chromatography were used to estimate SCD-1 indices. Hepatic fat, S, and SCD-1 were similar in black women and lower than in whites, regardless of menopausal status. Fasting and postprandial large, medium and small TRLPs, but not very small TRLPs, were lower in black women. Fasting large, medium and very small TRLPs negatively correlated with S and positively correlated with visceral and hepatic fat, and SCD-1 activity in both groups. In multivariate models, visceral fat and SCD-1 were associated with total fasting TRLP concentrations (adjR= 0.39, P=0.001). Black women had smaller postprandial changes in large (P=0.005) and medium TRLPs (P=0.007).  Lower visceral fat and SCD-1 activity may contribute to the paradoxical association of lower fasting and postprandial TRLP subfractions despite insulin resistance in black compared to white pre- and post-menopausal women. Similar concentrations of very small TRLPs are related to insulin resistance and could be important mediators of cardiometabolic disease risk in women.  .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668723>Dietary n-6 to n-3  acid ratio is related to  fat content independent of genetic effects: Evidence from the monozygotic co-twin control design.</a></h1><p>Lifestyle changes focusing on diet and exercise remain the cornerstone of the treatment of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). The present co-twin control study of monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs was designed to identify nutritional factors potentially involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.Cross-sectional study of 50 MZ twin pairs (age range: 23-36 years), of which ten pairs were discordant for  fat ( fat percentage of one twin ≤% and his/her co-twin >% and a difference between co-twins of >%) as determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Nutrient intake was calculated from 3-day food records.Among the ten  fat-discordant twin pairs, the n-6: n-3 ratio was significantly higher in the twins with higher  as compared to their co-twins with lower  fat (6.6:1 vs. 3.2:1, p-value = 0.005). In multiple regression analysis of within-pair differences including all 50 twin pairs, a higher n-6: n-3 ratio was significantly associated with a higher  fat percentage within MZ twin pairs after adjustment for body mass index, energy intake and other covariates (standardized beta = 0.43, p-value = 0.001).Our findings suggest that the n-6: n-3 ratio is a promising dietary agent for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.

All the three groups showed no obvious differences (P > 0.05) in the number of total piglets born, born alive, after cross-fostering, and at weaning, while the CS group exhibited a shorter farrowing duration (P < 0.05) and lower stillbirth rate (P < 0.05) when compared with the SO group. Additionally, litter weight at birth was significantly higher in the CS group than in the SO or FO group (P < 0.05). Despite no notable differences in the ADG of suckling piglets among dietary treatments (P > 0.05), the CS group had greater feed intake than the SO group during the lactation period (P < 0.05). In neonatal piglets with normal birth weight (NBW, 1.3 - 1. kg ), the CS group was lower than the SO group in the content of  glycogen (P < 0.05) and the mRNA abundances of  acid synthase, acetyl-coA carboxylase,  acid-binding protein 1, and acyl-CoA oxidase (P < 0.05). Interestingly, compared with the SO group, the FO group had a lower pre-weaning mortality rate (P < 0.05), but greater  glycogen pools (P < 0.05) in neonatal piglets with low birth weight (LBW, < 1.1 kg). Compared with the CS group, the FO group showed an increase in the plasma malondialdehyde levels (P < 0.05) of sows, as well as an increase of 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (P < 0.05) and a decrease of ferric reducing ability of plasma (P < 0.05) in NBW piglets. Overall, the diet rich in starch decreased the stillbirth rate and increased the litter weight of neonatal piglets, the dietary supplementation with fish oil decreased pre-weaning mortality rate, and the diet with a low n6: n3 ratio increased the oxidative status of sows and their offspring.© The Author(s) 2019.

Thus, here, we aimed to perform a meta-analysis on NAFLD prevalence in the lean or nonobese population to give clarity.PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched to identify studies reporting NAFLD prevalence in the lean/nonobese population. Lean or nonobese was defined by body mass index cutoffs reported by authors in original studies. NAFLD prevalence based on community, population, or health checkups was combined with random-effect model after logit transformation. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were further performed to investigate the heterogenicity.A total of 45 studies were enrolled in the final analysis, with 55,936 lean/nonobese subjects included, among whom 7351 NAFLD patients were diagnosed. Overall, the pooled NAFLD prevalence of the lean or nonobese population was 10.2% (95% confidence interval: 7.6%-13.6%) and 15.7% (95% confidence interval: 12.%-19.6%), respectively. Compared with western studies, the NAFLD prevalence in the lean or nonobese population was lower in eastern studies. In addition, the NAFLD prevalence in both the lean and nonobese population showed a general upward trend during recent years. The prevalence was similar in community-based and health checkup-based studies. Lean/nonobese NAFLD patients had significantly lower rates of hypertension, lower uric acid and fasting plasma glucose, and a higher level of high-density lipoprotein than nonlean/obese patients.The prevalence of NAFLD in the lean/nonobese population is not rare in either the western or eastern regions of the world.

Despite optimal medical management, PA often leads to acute and progressive neurological injury. Reports on  transplantation (LT) as a cellular therapy are limited and varied. The objective of this study was to examine the largest collection of patients who underwent LT for PA.Examining the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and the Pediatric Health Information System administrative billing databases, we performed a multicenter, retrospective analysis of LT over a 16-year period. During this period, 4849 pediatric LT were performed out of which 23 were done for PA at 10 different centers.The majority of recipients were  years of age or younger and had status 1b exception points at the time of transplant. The 1-, 3-, and - year graft survival for PA LT recipients was 84.6% and the 1-, 3, and - year patient survival was 89.%. There was no significant difference in graft or patient survival between PA and non-PA LT recipients. Despite historical data to the contrary, we did not find an increased incidence of hepatic arterial thrombosis in patients undergoing LT for PA. Patients in the PA LT group, however, had a significantly higher post-operative rate of readmission compared to the non-PA LT group (90.% vs. 72.8%, p = 0.021).LT for children with PA is a viable treatment option with acceptable outcomes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637346>Nonalcoholic  Disease in Nonobese Subjects of African Origin Has Atypical Metabolic Characteristics.</a></h1><p>Nonobese nonalcoholic  disease is reported in several populations.

CT was used to estimate  and abdominal fat and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to measure body composition. Fasting blood was collected for lipids, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), adiponectin, and fetuin-A. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), whole-body insulin sensitivity index (WBISI), insulinogenic index (IGI), and oral disposition index (oDI) were calculated after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test.Fifty-two percent of participants were male; mean (±SD) age was 28. ± 7.8 years, and body mass index was 22.4 ± 3.0 kg/m. Mean  attenuation (MLA) and /spleen (LS) ratio, both inversely correlated to  fat, were 62.8 ± 4.3 HU and 1.2 ± 0.1, respectively; 3.8% of participants had  fat >30% (LS ratio < 1). In age, sex, and BMI-adjusted correlations, MLA was negatively associated with weight ( = -0.30;  = 0.009) and height ( = -0.28;  = 0.017) and was associated with fasting glucose ( = 0.23;  = 0.05), fasting insulin ( = 0.42;  ≤ 0.001) and HOMA-IR ( = 0.35;  = 0.004). Serum lipids, ALT, adiponectin, fetuin-A, WBISI, IGI, and oDI were not associated with  fat.In nonobese Afro-Caribbean participants, greater  fat was associated with weight and height and lower fasting insulin and hyperinsulinemia appears to be influential in the reduction of NAFLD.

The aim of this study was to document the predicted ranges of serum ALP values in patients with hepatocellular  injury and ALT or AST values in patients with cholestasis. enzyme levels were documented in adult patients with various types and degrees of hepatocellular (non-alcoholic  disease, hepatitis B and C, alcohol and autoimmune hepatitis) and cholestatic (primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis) disease.In 5167 hepatocellular disease patients with ALT (or AST) values that were normal, 1-×, -10× or >10× elevated, median (95% CI) serum ALP levels were 0.64 (0.62-0.66), 0.72 (0.71-0.73), 0.80 (0.77-0.82) and 1.15 (1.0-1.22) fold elevated respectively. In 252 cholestatic patients with ALP values that were normal, 1-× or >× elevated, serum ALT (or AST) values were 1.13 (0.93-1.63), 2.47 (2.13-2.70) and 4.57 (3.27-.63) fold elevated respectively.

This study evaluated these hepatoprotective effects and the underlying mechanisms in a corticosterone (CORT)-induced  injury model in Pekin ducks fed a  intervention diet. A total of 500 Pekin ducks were randomly divided into five groups: one group (CON group) was only provided with a basal diet, three groups were provided a basal diet with 200 mg/kg (LCB group), 400 mg/kg (MCB group), or 600 mg/kg (HCB group) , respectively, and one group was provided a basal diet with 150 mg/kg aureomycin (ANT group) for 42 d. At 37 days-old, all ducks received daily intraperitoneal injections of CORT for five days to establish a  injury model.  intervention alleviated  injury by decreasing the  organ indices, hepatic steatosis and hepatocyte necrosis, and improving  function, antioxidant capacity, and inflammatory factors. Hepatic RNA-seq revealed 365 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the MCB and CON groups, with 229 up- and 136 down-regulated DEGs in the MCB group. Between the MCB and ANT groups, 407 DEGs were identified, including 299 up- and 108 down-regulated genes in MCB group. Some DEGs in the MCB group related to oxidative stress and inflammatory responses such as Sod3, , and  which were up-regulated, while , , , , , and , which are involved in lipid metabolism, were down-regulated, indicating that these genes were responsive to dietary  for the alleviation of corticosterone-induced hepatic injury. Toll-like receptor signaling, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, adipocytokine and glycerophospholipid metabolism signaling pathway were significantly enriched in the MCB group.

We investigated the ability of scoring systems to identify individuals in the general population at risk for future -related events.We collected data from the Swedish Apolipoprotein Mortality Risk cohort on persons 35-79 years old who had blood samples collected from 1985 through 1996. We collected APRI (n=127,302), BARD (n=75,303), FIB-4 (n=126,941), Forns (n=122,419), and the nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) fibrosis scores (NFS, n=13,160). We ascertained incident cases of cirrhosis or complications by linking Swedish health data registers. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for severe  disease at , 10, and a maximum follow-up time of 27 years. The predictive ability of the scores was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve and C-statistics analyses. Our specific aims were to investigate the predictive capabilities of scoring systems for fatal and non-fatal  disease, determine which scoring system has the highest level of accuracy, and investigate the predictive abilities of the scoring systems in persons with a higher probability of NAFLD at baseline.A similar proportion of individuals evaluated by each scoring system developed cirrhosis or complications thereof (1.0%-1.4%). The incidence of any outcome was increased in intermediate- and high-risk groups compared with low-risk groups, with HRs at 10 years in the high-risk group ranging from 1.67 for the BARD score to 45.9 for the APRI score. The predictive abilities of all scoring systems decreased with time and were higher in men. All scoring systems were more accurate in persons with risk factors for NAFLD at baseline, with AUROCs reaching 0.83.Higher scores from non-invasive scoring systems to evaluate fibrosis are associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis in a general population, but their predictive ability is modest. Performance was better when patients were followed for shorter time periods and in persons with a higher risk of NAFLD, with AUROC values reaching 0.83. New scoring systems are needed to evaluate risk of fibrosis in the general population and in primary care.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Mendelian randomization using GWAS meta-analysis data was performed to estimate the causal effect of non-alcoholic  disease (PNPLA3, LYPLAL1, NCAN, GCKR) on eGFR (N 118,460), microalbuminuria (N 54,116), and impaired renal function (N 118,147).In total, 2,023 participants (mean age 55. ± 6.0 years, 53% women) were included of which 29% had  and 2.0% chronic kidney disease stage ≥3. In joint models, VAT was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of microalbuminuria which was mainly driven by the association in women (total population: per standard deviation [SD] = 55.4 cm, odds ratio [OR] 2.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-3.47; women: OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.44, .56), but HTGC was not (total population: per SD = 7.9%, OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.85, 1.70). No associations were found for VAT and HTGC with eGFR (VAT: per SD = 55.4 cm, OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.83, 1.87; HTGC: per SD = 7.9%, OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.42, 0.99). No causal effect of NAFLD on microalbuminuria or impaired renal function was found.In observational analyses, visceral fat was associated with microalbuminuria in women.  fat was not associated with microalbuminuria or renal function, which was supported by Mendelian randomization. Visceral fat might be more important than  fat in the etiology of microalbuminuria.Copyright © 2019 National Kidney Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Although vitamin A is generally recognized as the major vitamin A, vitamin A is found in some birds and mammals that eat fish containing vitamin A. Plasma concentration of retinyl esters, but not retinol, is known to increase postprandially in humans. The objectives of this study were to confirm the presence of vitamin A in fish fed to penguins, and in penguin plasma, and the postprandial changes in vitamin A concentration in penguin plasma. Blood was collected from six male African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) before and after feeding on jack mackerels (Trachurus japonicus) along with a vitamin premix containing vitamin A. Vitamin A concentration in fish was much higher than the requirement, and was -fold higher than the vitamin A concentration. Vitamin A was present in plasma but its concentration was at least 100-fold below that of plasma retinol, suggesting that vitamin A is much less bioavailable than vitamin A in penguins. Plasma retinol and retinyl palmitate concentrations were found to be stable after the meal. Plasma retinol concentration is suggested to be homeostatically controlled in penguins against the rapid flow of vitamin A after meal. The absorbed vitamin A is thought to be transported to the  via the portal vein for storage in penguins, resulting in stable retinyl palmitate concentration in plasma after meal.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481896>Baveno Criteria Safely Identify Patients With Compensated Advanced Chronic  Disease Who Can Avoid Variceal Screening Endoscopy: A Diagnostic Test Accuracy Meta-Analysis.</a></h1><p> The Baveno VI Consensus Workshop defined criteria ( stiffness measured by transient elastography <20 kPa and platelet count >150 × 10 cells/L) to identify those patients with compensated advanced chronic  diseases (cACLD) who are unlikely to have varices needing treatment (VNTs) and can safely avoid variceal screening endoscopy. This meta-analysis aimed to quantify the safety and efficacy of these criteria in suspected cACLD with  stiffness >10 kPa and in compensated chronic  diseases (cCLD) irrespective of  stiffness.  A systematic search was conducted in nine databases for studies discussed cACLD or cCLD and tested Baveno criteria against variceal screening endoscopy. The main safety and efficacy endpoints were missed VNT rate and spared endoscopy rate (SER), respectively; calculated with the random effect model. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated with the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model. For all outcome measures, 95% confidence intervals were computed. Heterogeneity was tested with  -statistics.  The search yielded 13 studies including 4,464 patients which reported on suspected cACLD. Pooled missed VNT rate was 0.3% (0.1-0.6%;   = 45.%), pooled SER was 32.8% (24.8-41.4%;   = 97.0%). Sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of Baveno criteria were 97% (95-98%), 41% (27-57%), and 96% (94-97%), respectively. In the subgroups of cACLD from hepatitis C and B viruses, non-alcoholic  disease/steatohepatitis, or alcohol, missed VNT rates were 0.0% (0.0-0.3%), 1.2% (0.4-2.2%), 0.0% (0.0-1.3%), or 0.0% (0.0-0.4%), while SERs were 24.2% (20.-28.1%), 24.9% (21.7-28.4%), 38.6% (10.9-70.8%), or 27.0% (16.9-38.4%), respectively. If we expanded the study population to cCLD, 27 studies included 7,534 patients. Missed VNT rate was 0.2% (0.1-0.%;   = 39.8%) with a SER of 30.% (25.2-36.2%;   = 96.1%) while Se, Sp, and AUC were 97% (93-99%), 35% (27-44%), and 80% (77-84%), respectively.  The application of Baveno criteria significantly reduces the number of unnecessary variceal screening endoscopies while being safe: cACLD patients with  stiffness <20 kPa and platelet count > 150 × 10 cells/L carry a very low chance (i.e., 0.3%) of having VNTs. The criteria preserve low missed VNT rate with lower diagnostic performance among cCLD patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604171>Visceral adipose tissue volume is associated with premature atherosclerosis in early type 2 diabetes mellitus independent of traditional risk factors.</a></h1><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is commonly associated with abdominal obesity, predominantly with high visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and is accompanied by premature atherosclerosis. However, the association between VAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) with premature atherosclerosis and (i.e. arterial) inflammation is not completely understood. To provide more insight into this association, we investigated the association between arterial F-fluordeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) uptake, as a measure of arterial inflammation, and metabolic syndrome (MetS) markers in early T2DM patients.Forty-four patients with early T2DM, without glucose lowering medication, were studied (median age 63 [IQR 54-66] years, median BMI 30.4 [IQR 27.-35.8]). Arterial inflammation was quantified using glucose corrected maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) FDG of the aorta, carotid, iliac, and femoral arteries, and corrected for background activity (blood pool) as target-to-background ratio (TBR). VAT and SAT volumes (cm) were automatically segmented using computed tomography (CT) between levels L1-L5. Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) was assessed by  function test and CT.VAT volume, but not SAT volume, correlated with TBR (r = 0.325, p = 0.031). Linear regression models showed a significant association, even after sequential adjustment for potentially influencing MetS components. Interaction term VAT volume * sex and additional components including HbA1c, insulin resistance, NAFLD, adiponectin, leptin, and C- reactive protein (CRP) did not change the independent association between VAT volume and TBR.CT-assessed VAT volume is positively associated with FDG-PET assessed arterial inflammation, independently of factors thought to potentially mediate these effects. These findings suggest that VAT in contrast to SAT is linked to early atherosclerotic changes in T2DM patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

NAFLD was diagnosed from detection of steatosis by histology or imaging, no alcohol intake, and exclusion of other  diseases. Cirrhosis was defined by histological features, imaging data, and symptoms. We compared NAFLD-related HCC with or without cirrhosis and non-cirrhotic NAFLD with or without HCC.There were 48 non-cirrhotic HCC patients and 71 cirrhotic HCC patients. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that other than  function factors male gender (OR: .603, 95%CI: 1.577-19.900), light drinker (OR: 2.797, 95%CI: 1.031-7.589), and tumor size (OR: 1.031, 95%CI 1.009-1.055) differ significantly between these two groups. The recurrence rate was significantly lower in the non-cirrhotic HCC group than the cirrhotic HCC group, with risk factors being des-γ-carboxy prothrombin and the number of HCCs. The non-cirrhotic HCC group showed significantly better survival due to absence of non-cancerous  failure. Comparison between non-cirrhotic NAFLD patients with or without HCC (n=612) revealed the following risk factors for HCC: male gender (OR: 7.774, 95%CI: 2.176-27.775), light drinker (OR: 4.893, 95%CI: 1.923-12.449), and high FIB4-index (OR 2.634, 95%CI: 1.787-3.884).In patients with non-cirrhotic NAFLD, important risk factors for HCC were male gender, alcohol consumption, and the FIB4-index. HCC recurrence and survival were only influenced by the tumor stage. We should be aware of alcohol consumption as a modifiable risk factor for HCC.This article is protected by copyright.

While prolonged HFD-induced metabolic complications are partly mediated by increased food intake during the light (inactive) phase, such a link has not yet been established in short-term HFD-fed mice. Herein, we hypothesized that a short bout of HFD desynchronizes feeding behavior, thereby contributing to glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis. To this end, 12-wk-old C57BL/6J littermates were fed a HFD for 4 days either ad libitum or intermittently. Intermittent-fed mice were fasted for 8 h during their inactive phase. Initiation of HFD led to an immediate increase in food intake already during the first light phase. Moreover, glucose tolerance was significantly impaired in ad libitum- but not in intermittent HFD-fed mice, indicating that desynchronized feeding behavior contributes to short-term HFD-induced glucose intolerance. Of note, overall food intake was similar between the groups, as was body weight. However, intermittent HFD-fed mice revealed higher fat depot weights. Phosphorylation of hormone sensitivity lipase and free  acid release from isolated adipocytes were significantly elevated, suggesting increased lipolysis in intermittent HFD-fed mice. Moreover, hepatic mRNA expression of lipogenetic enzymes and  triglyceride levels were significantly increased in intermittent HFD-fed mice. Importantly, food deprivation decreased respiratory exchange ratio promptly in intermittent- but not in ad libitum HFD-fed mice. In conclusion, retaining a normal feeding pattern prevented HFD-induced impairment of metabolic flexibility in short-term HFD-fed mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534817>Exercise as a prescription for patients with various diseases.</a></h1><p>A growing understanding of the benefits of exercise over the past few decades has prompted researchers to take an interest in the possibilities of exercise therapy. Because each sport has its own set of characteristics and physiological complications that tend to occur during exercise training, the effects and underlying mechanisms of exercise remain unclear. Thus, the first step in probing the effects of exercise on different diseases is the selection of an optimal exercise protocol. This review summarizes the latest exercise prescription treatments for 26 different diseases: musculoskeletal system diseases (low back pain, tendon injury, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and hip fracture), metabolic system diseases (obesity, type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, and nonalcoholic  disease), cardio-cerebral vascular system diseases (coronary artery disease, stroke, and chronic heart failure), nervous system diseases (Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, depression, and anxiety disorders), respiratory system diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, and after lung transplantation), urinary system diseases (chronic kidney disease and after kidney transplantation), and cancers (breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and lung cancer). Each exercise prescription is displayed in a corresponding table. The recommended type, intensity, and frequency of exercise prescriptions are summarized, and the effects of exercise therapy on the prevention and rehabilitation of different diseases are discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604978>Plasmodium Infection Induces Dyslipidemia and a Hepatic Lipogenic State in the Host through the Inhibition of the AMPK-ACC Pathway.</a></h1><p>Malaria is a major parasitic disease of humans and is a health public problem that affects more than 100 countries. In 2017, it caused nearly half a million deaths out of 219 million infections. Malaria is caused by the protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium and is transmitted by female mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles. Once in the bloodstream, Plasmodium merozoites invade erythrocytes and proliferate until the cells lyses and release new parasites that invade other erythrocytes. Remarkably, they can manipulate the vertebrate host's lipid metabolism pathways, since they cannot synthesize lipid classes that are essential for their development and replication. In this study, we show that mice infected with Plasmodium chabaudi present a completely different plasma profile from control mice, with marked hyperproteinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypoglycemia, and hypocholesterolemia. In addition, white adipose and hepatic tissue and analyses from infected animals revealed the accumulation of triacylglycerol in both tissues and free  acids and free cholesterol in the . Hepatic mRNA and protein expression of key enzymes and transcription factors involved in lipid metabolism were also altered by P. chabaudi infection, leading to a lipogenic state. The enzyme ' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of cell energetic metabolism, was also modulated by the parasite, which reduced AMPK phosphorylation levels upon infection. Pretreatment with metformin for 21 days followed by infection with P. chabaudi was effective in preventing infection of mice and also lowered the hepatic accumulation of lipids while activating AMPK. Together, these results provide new and important information on the specific molecular mechanisms induced by the malaria parasite to regulate hepatic lipid metabolism in order to facilitate its development, proliferation, and lifespan in its vertebrate host.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515832>Optimization of betacyanins from agricultural by-products using pressurized hot water extraction for antioxidant and in vitro oleic acid-induced steatohepatitis inhibitory activity.</a></h1><p>Pressurized hot water extraction (PHWE) is proposed to recover betacyanins from agricultural by-products (pitaya fruits peels (PFP), red beet stalks (RBS), and cactus pear peels (CPP)). The extraction yield of betacyanins was optimized by response surface methodology. The optimal PHWE conditions were attained and the actual yields of betacyanins under optimal conditions were well matched with the predicted yields. In addition, betacyanin pigment compositions as well as superoxide anion scavenging activity of individual betacyanins extract (BE) produced in optimal PHWE conditions were characterized by HPLC-ESI/MS and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of three BEs on oleic acid-induced steatohepatitis in cellular model was comparatively investigated. The results showed that unlike PFP, RBS, and CPP presented excellent efficacy in decreasing intracellular triglyceride and reactive oxygen species, inhibiting the release of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase as well as regulating  acid synthase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 mRNAs expression. Practical applications In this study, PHWE, is firstly proposed for the enhancement of the extraction of betacyanins from three agricultural by-products. Betacyanin-rich extracts by PHWE method exhibit excellent activities in inhibition of ROS and regulation of lipid metabolism in hepatic cells. It suggests that PHWE has a strong potentiality in keeping bioactivity of BEs, which is significant for the production of betacyanins functional foods.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31584681>Association of Histologic Disease Activity With Progression of Nonalcoholic  Disease.</a></h1><p>The histologic evolution of the full spectrum of nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and factors associated with progression or regression remain to be definitively established.To evaluate the histologic evolution of NAFLD and the factors associated with changes in disease severity over time.A prospective cohort substudy from the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN) NAFLD Database study, a noninterventional registry, was performed at 8 university medical research centers. Masked assessment of  histologic specimens was performed, using a prespecified protocol to score individual biopsies. Participants included 446 adults with NAFLD enrolled in the NASH CRN Database studies between October 27, 2004, and September 13, 2013, who underwent 2  biopsies 1 or more year apart. Data analysis was performed from October 2016 to October 2018.Progression and regression of fibrosis stage, using clinical, laboratory, and histologic findings, including the NAFLD activity score (NAS) (sum of scores for steatosis, lobular inflammation, and ballooning; range, 0-8, with 8 indicating more severe disease).A total of 446 adults (mean [SD] age, 47 [11] years; 294 [65.9%] women) with NAFLD (NAFL, 86 [19.3%]), borderline NASH (84 [18.8%]), and definite NASH (276 [61.9%]) were studied. Over a mean (SD) interval of 4.9 (2.8) years between biopsies, NAFL resolved in 11 patients (12.8%) and progressed to steatohepatitis in 36 patients (41.9%). Steatohepatitis resolved in 24 (28.6%) of the patients with borderline NASH and 61 (22.1%) of those with definite NASH. Fibrosis progression or regression by at least 1 stage occurred in 132 (30%) and 151 [34%] participants, respectively. Metabolic syndrome (20 [95%] vs 108 [72%]; P = .03), baseline NAS (mean [SD], .0 [1.4] vs 4.3 [1.6]; P = .005), and smaller reduction in NAS (-0.2 [2] vs -0.9 [2]; P < .001) were associated with progression to advanced (stage 3-4) fibrosis vs those without progression to stage 3 to 4 fibrosis. Fibrosis regression was associated with lower baseline insulin level (20 vs 33 μU/mL; P = .02) and decrease in all NAS components (steatosis grade -0.8 [0.1] vs -0.3 [0.9]; P < .001; lobular inflammation -0.

Hepassocin is a novel hepatokine that causes hepatic steatosis and induces insulin resistance (IR). However, the role of hepassocin in obesity remains obscure. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between hepassocin levels and obesity. In total, 371 subjects who had a normal weight (NW), were overweight, or were obese were enrolled. We found that hepassocin levels in subjects who were overweight (6,705 ± 1,707 pg/ml) or obese (7,335 ± 2,077 pg/ml) were significantly higher than those of subjects with a NW (,767 ± 1,500 pg/ml) (p < .001, test for trend). A multiple linear regression analysis showed that the body-mass index, waist circumference, nonalcoholic  disease, and homeostatic model assessment of IR were independently associated with hepassocin after adjusting for age, sex, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, log triglycerides, alanine transaminase, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate. This study provides evidence that subjects who were overweight or obese had significantly higher hepassocin levels than those with a NW.

Compared with AS model group, wheat bran fiber decreased  homogenate TC level((60. 56±13. 49) μmol/g vs. (51. 10±. 94) μmol/g)(P<0. 05), reduced protein expression of SREBP-1, FAS and ACC(P<0. 05), increased protein expression of SREBP-2SR-B1(P<0. 05).Taken together, wheat bran fiber can delay the occurance of AS by regulating the related protein expressions involved in lipid metabolism and improving hepatic lipid metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616170>Skeletal muscle mass to visceral fat area ratio is an important determinant associated with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.</a></h1><p>Skeletal muscle mass to visceral fat area ratio (SVR) were shown to be related to some chronic diseases, such as non-alcoholic  diseases. The aim of this study is to determine whether the SVR is associated with metabolic syndrome (MS) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM).A total of 798 subjects were included in this cross-sectional study. Lipid profiles, plasma glucose, blood pressure, waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI) were grouped by the SVR. The associations between the SVR and T2DM and MS were examined using logistic regression to determine whether the SVR was associated with T2DM and MS.Lipid profiles, glucose levels, blood pressure, WC and BMI showed significant differences when stratified based on the extent of SVR. The SVR levels were also significantly higher in subjects without MS or T2DM than in those with MS or T2DM. The SVR was inversely correlated with lipid profiles and WC and was especially correlated with BMI, with an r>0.. The SVR was identified as a risk factor for T2DM and MS after adjusting age and sex. SVR can predict T2DM [area under the curve =0.726, 95% CI (0.669-0.782), <0.001] and MS [area under the curve =0.730, 95% CI (0.694-0.766), <0.001]. The suitable cut-off value is 0.230 for T2DM (sensitivity 0.696, specificity 0.694) and 0.278 for the onset of MS (sensitivity 0.518, specificity 0.862).The SVR is closely associated with an increased risk for exacerbating T2DM and MS and can be used as a diagnostic indicator for T2DM and MS.© 2019 Wang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594083>[Analysis of changes in clinical characteristics and laboratory indexes of 54 cases of acute  of pregnancy].</a></h1><p> To investigate the changes in clinical characteristics and laboratory indexes before and after the termination of pregnancy in patients with acute  of pregnancy (AFLP).  Patients with acute  of pregnancy who had been admitted to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University and Chongqing Municipal People's Hospital of Jiangbei District between 2007 and 2018 were selected. Clinical characteristics and complications during diagnosis and treatment, changes in blood coagulation,  and kidney function, and postpartum recovery were collected for retrospectively analysis.  54 cases with average gestational age of 35.0±1.7 weeks at third trimester of pregnancy with AFLP were treated. The most common gastrointestinal symptoms were yellow urine, nausea and vomiting. All patients had elevated bilirubin. 90.7% patients had changes in blood coagulation function and 68.% had elevated serum creatinine. Transaminase levels were dropped rapidly within 1-2 days after the termination of pregnancy. Total bilirubin recovery was slow and partially recovered after 6-8 days. Serum creatinine and BUN increased slightly after delivery, reaching a peak at 3-4 days and then began to deplete. There was slight change in prothrombin time and fibrinogen after delivery, but returned to normal level after -6 days. The most common complications were AKI (74.1%), LF (42.6%), PPH (40.7%) and DIC (33.3%). Twenty-three of the 54 cases (42.6%) progressed to acute  failure. AFLP complicated with ALF course was significantly longer than healthy controls, and the disease severity was significantly increased, with a mortality rate of 17.4% (4/23), and 0 in healthy controls. The difference was statistically significant.  Early diagnosis and termination of pregnancy are the key factors to determine the prognosis of pregnant patients with acute . Blood coagulation function does not deteriorate after termination of pregnancy and renal function begins to recover after 4 days with slight restoration of  function. The control of complications is an important factor to determine the prognosis of patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611031>Characterization of biopsy proven non-alcoholic  disease in healthy non-obese and lean population of living  donors: The impact of uric acid.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is frequently seen among non-obese overweight individuals and lean subjects (those with normal body mass index). This study aimed to investigate prevalence and risk factors of biopsy proven NAFLD in a cluster of healthy non-obese and lean individuals.In a retrospective study, adult (>18 years) apparently healthy individuals who had donated  to pediatric patients between July 2012 and October 2018 were included. Non-obese and lean individuals were defined as BMI<30kg/m and BMI<25kg/m, respectively.Totally 310 patients were included. Seventy-six individuals (24.%) had NAFL and 30 patients (9.67%) had non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) among non-obese population. In multivariate regression analysis, only higher BMI was marginally associated with NASH in non-obese compared to those without NASH (Odds ratio: 2.52, 95% CI: 0.097-6.54; P=0.05). Totally, 246 individuals were lean. 55 individuals (22.3%) had NAFL and 20 individuals (8.2%) had NASH in their  biopsies. In univariate analysis, serum triglyceride, cholesterol, LDL, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and uric acid were associated with NAFL among lean individuals (P<0.05). In regression analysis, serum uric acid was associated with NAFL (Odds ratio: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.18-2.45; P=0.004) and NASH in lean individuals (Odds ratio: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.27-3.10; P=0.003).NAFLD/NASH is prevalent even in a healthy lean population when evaluated by  biopsy. Higher BMI and serum uric acid were two major risks of NAFLD/NASH in non-obese and lean individuals.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Vitamin E is recommended for treatment of NASH in the general population. However, its safety and efficacy among HIV-infected patients remain unknown.Single centre, phase IV, open-label, single arm clinical trial.HIV mono-infected patients without significant alcohol intake or viral hepatitis coinfection were included. The diagnosis of NASH was based on the co-existence of , diagnosed by controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) ≥ 248 dB/m, and significant hepatocyte apoptosis, defined by the serum biomarker cytokeratin 18 (CK-18) >130. U/L. Participants were treated with 800 IU daily of oral vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) for 24 weeks, and followed for an additional 24 weeks post-discontinuation. Generalized linear mixed effects models were used to evaluate changes in ALT, CAP and CK-18 at the completion of treatment and end of follow-up, controlling for pre-treatment trends.A total of 27 patients were included. Four (15%) had a pretreatment  biopsy, which confirmed the diagnosis of NASH in all cases. Compared to baseline, 24 weeks of vitamin E treatment improved ALT (-27 units/L; 95% confidence interval [CI] -37, --17), CAP scores (-22 dB/m; 95% CI -42, -1) and CK-18 (-123 units/L; 95% CI -201, -46).

It is characterized by accumulation of fat in the hepatocytes associated with lobular inflammation and balonization, which can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. Thus, a characterization and follow-up of a progression of the fibrosis level of these patients becomes important, being that the transient hepatic elastography is a reliable method for this evaluation with a measure of the kapa index.To evaluate the progression of hepatic fibrosis through elastography in patients with non-alcoholic  disease.Patients who had previously performed hepatic biopsy and noninvasive scores for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis were included in the study. These same subjects were then submitted to current clinical evaluation, laboratory and  elastography tests, defining the level of  fibrosis, about 10 years after the first evaluation.Data were analyzed for 66 patients previously submitted to  biopsy. Of these, 16 were not found, four could not participate because they were debilitated due to hepatic cirrhosis, two had died from an automobile accident and five from complications of cirrhosis of the . Therefore, of the 50 patients with a known history, 9 (18%) had died of cirrhosis or were unable to attend the examination because of their  disease. The remaining population was predominantly female (61.%), mean age of 63 years, being overweight, dyslipidemia (76.9%), disorders of the glycemic profile (76.9%), and metabolic syndrome (82.1%). Of the 39 cases evaluated, 35% had the same degree of fibrosis at the initial evaluation (biopsy) and at the current evaluation (elastography), 33% had an increase in the degree of fibrosis and another 30% had a decrease in the degree of fibrosis. Twenty-eight patients had NASH at baseline. Regarding these patients, it was observed in the current evaluation, that 25% remained stable in the degree of fibrosis, 39% progressed, and 35% regressed.Despite some limitations of our study, such as the small number of patients, and the use of two different methods of evaluation (biopsy and elastography), the data obtained allow us to conclude that of the 39 evaluated cases, 33% (13) presented progression of fibrosis and the total group of 50 patients, 42% had cirrhosis or died due to  disease.

However, data on the prevalence and outcomes of hospitalizations with NAFLD are lacking. We investigated the prevalence, trends and outcomes of NAFLD hospitalizations in the US.Hospitalizations with NAFLD were identified in the National Inpatient Sample (2007-2014) by their ICD-9-CM codes, and the prevalence and trends over an 8-year period were calculated among different demographic groups. After excluding other causes of  disease among the NAFLD cohorts (n=210,660), the impact of sex, race and region on outcomes (mortality, discharge disposition, length of stay [LOS], and cost) were computed using generalized estimating equations (SAS 9.4).Admissions with NAFLD tripled from 2007-2014 at an average rate of 79/100,000 hospitalizations/year (P<0.0001), with a larger rate of increase among males vs. females (83/100,000 vs. 75/100,000), Hispanics vs. Whites vs. Blacks (107/100,000 vs. 80/100,000 vs. 48/100,000), and government-insured or uninsured patients vs. privately-insured (94/100,000 vs. 74/100,000). Males had higher mortality, LOS, and cost than females. Blacks had longer LOS and poorer discharge destination than Whites; while Hispanics and Asians incurred higher cost than Whites. Uninsured patients had higher mortality, longer LOS, and poorer discharge disposition than the privately-insured.Hospitalizations with NAFLD are rapidly increasing in the US, with a disproportionately higher burden among certain demographic groups.

Due to the increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) has evolved into a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma development. Herein, we investigated whether a dietary n-3 polyunsaturated  acid (PUFA) supplementation improves the outcome of progressive NAFLD.Feeding three high-fat diets, differing in n-3 and n-6 PUFA contents and ratios (n-3/n-6: 1:8, 1:1, :1), the impact of n-3 PUFAs and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios on NAFLD-related  fibrosis and tumorigenesis was analyzed in 12- and 20-week-old streptozotocin/high-fat diet (STZ/HFD)-treated mice.Feeding of n-3 PUFA-rich diets (1:1 and :1) resulted in increased hepatic n-3 PUFA content and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio with decreased hepatic lipid accumulation. In 20-week-old mice, n-3 PUFA-rich diets alleviated tumor load significantly, with reduced /body weight index, tumor size, and tumor number. Finally, these effects were accompanied by a significant improvement of survival of these mice.Herein, we showed that increased n-3 PUFA content and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios lead to improved survival and attenuated tumor progression in STZ/HFD-treated mice. Thus, n-3 PUFAs could be the basis for new therapeutic options against NAFLD-related tumorigenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566148>Adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is associated with lower presence of non-alcoholic  disease in middle-aged and elderly adults.</a></h1><p>Previous studies have shown that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet might contribute to managing risk factors of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), but evidence is limited. We examined the association of DASH diet score (DASH-DS) with NAFLD, as well as the intermediary effects of serum retinol-binding protein-4 (RBP4), serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), serum TAG, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and BMI.We performed a cross-sectional analysis of a population-based cohort study. Dietary data and lifestyle factors were assessed by face-to-face interviews and the DASH-DS was then calculated. We assessed serum RBP4, hs-CRP and TAG and calculated HOMA-IR. The presence and degree of NAFLD were determined by abdominal sonography.Guangzhou, China.Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study participants, aged 40-75 years at baseline (n 3051).After adjusting for potential covariates, we found an inverse association between DASH-DS and the presence of NAFLD (Ptrend = 0·009). The OR (95 % CI) of NAFLD for quintiles 2- were 0·78 (0·62, 0·98), 0·74 (0·59, 0·94), 0·69 (0·55, 0·86) and 0·77 (0·61, 0·97), respectively. Path analyses indicated that a higher DASH-DS was associated with lower serum RBP4, hs-CRP, TAG, HOMA-IR and BMI, which were positively associated with the degree of NAFLD.Adherence to the DASH diet was independently associated with a marked lower prevalence of NAFLD in Chinese adults, especially in women and those without abdominal obesity, and might be mediated by reducing RBP4, hs-CRP, TAG, HOMA-IR and BMI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31471434>The association between a non-invasive hepatic fibrosis score and urolithiasis among non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) patients in China: a cross-sectional study.</a></h1><p>Mounting data now support a strong link between the presence of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and an increased risk of urolithiasis. However, little is known on the association between hepatic fibrosis and the risk of urolithiasis among NAFLD patients. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of urolithiasis among NAFLD patients and determine whether the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score, a surrogate marker of hepatic fibrosis, is associated with urolithiasis among NAFLD patients.Cross-sectional studies.China.A total of 2058 adult patients with NAFLD were included in this study. Logistic regression analysis was used to detect the association between FIB-4 score and urolithiasis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the diagnostic value of FIB-4 score for the detection of urolithiasis among NAFLD patients.200 (9.7%) individuals had ultrasonography-diagnosed urolithiasis among 2058 NAFLD patients. FIB-4 score (OR=1.58; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.31), age (OR=1.11; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.13), obesity (OR=3.16; 95% CI 2.29 to 4.39) and hyperuricemia (OR=3.79; 95% CI 2.67 to .36) were independent factors associated with urolithiasis among NAFLD patients. Moreover, a novel algorithm including multiple variables (FIB-4 score, age, obesity and hyperuricemia) showed an area under a ROC curve of 0.813 (95% CI 0.795 to 0.829) for identifying urolithiasis among NAFLD patients. The optimal cut-off value of > -2.23 for the multivariate model provides a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 74% for predicting urolithiasis among NAFLD patients.Urolithiasis among NAFLD patients is associated with FIB-4 score. Further, a novel algorithm based on FIB-4 score could serve as a useful tool for identifying individuals with a higher risk of urolithiasis among NAFLD patients, although prospective cohort studies are still needed in the future.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

We have attempted to determine the differences in metabolic profile of adolescents with and without markers of NAFLD.  We performed cross-sectional analyses in a sample of 3,048 participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children at age 17. We used three indicators of NAFLD: ALT >40 U/l; AST >40 U/l and ultrasound scan-assessed steatosis. Associations between each measure of NAFLD and 154 metabolic traits, assessed by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, were analyzed by multivariable linear regression, adjusting for age, sex and BMI.  All three indicators of NAFLD were associated with ~0. standard deviation (SD) greater concentrations of all extremely large to small very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) measures. ALT >40U/l was associated with ~0.5SD greater concentrations of very small VLDLs, intermediate-density lipoproteins and low-density lipoproteins. Concentrations of most cholesterols, including remnant cholesterol, all triglycerides and monounsaturated  acids, in addition to glycoprotein acetyls (inflammatory marker), were also higher in participants with NAFLD.  We have identified differing metabolic profiles between adolescents with and without indicators of NAFLD. These results provide the foundations for future research to determine whether these differences persist and result in adverse future cardiometabolic health.Copyright: © 2019 Hartley A et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637181>Effect of Weight Reduction on Histological Activity and Fibrosis of Lean Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Patient.</a></h1><p>Weight reduction has evidenced benefit on attenuation of histological activity and fibrosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but there is scarcity of data for lean NASH subgroup.

In lean/non-lean group, any amount of weight reduction, ≥ % weight reduction and ≥ 7% weight reduction was found in respectively 8/11, /6 and 2/6 patients. In both lean and non-lean groups, weight reduction of any amount was associated with significant reduction of steatosis, ballooning and NAS, except lobular inflammation and fibrosis. In both groups, weight reduction of ≥ % was associated with significant reduction in NAS only. However, significant improvement in NAS was noted with ≥ 7% weight reduction in non-lean group only.Smaller amount of weight reduction had the good benefit of improvement in all the segments of histological activity in both lean and non-lean NASH.© 2019 Shahinul Alam, Mohammad Jahid Hasan, Md.

All patients underwent sonographic examination with adiposity measurements and the  biopsy.  fibrosis was evaluated semi-quantitatively according to the METAVIR scoring system and using non-invasive markers of hepatic fibrosis.  Waist circumference (WC) was predictive for increased risk of FP in NAFLD patients. Elevated fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, serum amylase and lipase levels were associated with presence of severe FP ( value = 0.052,  value = 0.007,  value = 0.014;  value = 0.024, respectively). Presence of increased amounts of mesenteric fat was associated with severe FP ( value = 0.013). The results of this study demonstrated highly significant association between NAFLD and presence of FP. The model for predicting the presence of FP was designed with probability value above 6..  Pancreatic fat accumulation leads to worsening of pancreatic function which in turns exacerbates severity of metabolic syndrome associated with both, NAFLD and NAFPD.</p></html>
