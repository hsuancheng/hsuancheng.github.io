The predominant fats used are soybean/sunflower (SS) or rapeseed/canola (RC) oils and animal fat (D) in dairy products. This review aimed to investigate whether the carrier fat is a determinant of the hypocholesterolaemic effects of  fortified foods. Databases were searched using relevant keywords and published RCTs from 1990 investigating the effects of dietary  intervention (≥1.5g per day) on total cholesterol and LDL-C were included. After methodological quality assessment and data extraction, a total of 32 RCTs (RC, n=; SS, n=9; D, n=8) were included. As expected, all fat groups significantly reduced TC and LDL-C (p<.01). When compared across different carrier fats, RC as the main carrier fat, reduced LDL-C significantly more than the SS spreads (p=.01). Therefore, a combination of monounsaturated fatty acid rich spread with adequate amounts of omega-3 fatty acids (as evident in RC spreads) may be the superior carrier fat for the delivery of  for optimal blood cholesterol-lowering. The findings of this research provide useful evidence for optimising the hypocholesterolaemic effects of  and support further investigation into the possible mechanisms behind these findings.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Male Golden Syrian hamsters were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=/group) and fed a cornstarch-casein-sucrose-based diet containing .% cholesterol and 5% . Three treatment groups were supplemented with .17% (equivalent to 100mgkg(-1)d(-1)) BBR, 1% , or a combination of both (BBRPS) for 4wk. At the end of the study, plasma lipids were analyzed with enzymatic methods, cholesterol absorption and synthesis using stable isotope tracer methodology, and gene and protein expressions in the liver and small intestine using real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. BBR and  significantly lowered plasma total- and nonHDL-cholesterol levels, and BBRPS markedly improved cholesterol-lowering efficacy compared to BBR or  alone. Further examinations revealed that BBR and  both inhibited cholesterol absorption and by contrast, increased cholesterol synthesis, and exerted a synergistic action when they were combined. Plasma total or nonHDL-cholesterol levels were significantly correlated with cholesterol absorption rates. BBR upregulated sterol 27-hydroxlase gene expression and BBRPS increased both cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase and sterol 27-hydroxlase gene expressions. BBR and  also synergistically decreased plasma triacylglycerides. These findings suggest that the cholesterol-lowering action of BBR might involve a combination of inhibition of cholesterol absorption and stimulation of bile acid synthesis. The combination of BBR and  improves cholesterol-lowering efficacy through a synergistic action on cholesterol absorption, in addition to synergistically reducing plasma triacylglycerols in hamsters.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24381122>Prohormone supplement 3β-hydroxy-5α-androst-1-en-17-one enhances resistance training gains but impairs user health.</a></h1><p>Prohormone supplements () are recognized not to impart anabolic or ergogenic effects in men, but the research supporting these conclusions is dated. The Anabolic Steroid Control Act was amended in 2004 to classify androstenedione and 17 additional anabolic compounds as controlled substances. The viability of  that entered the market after that time have not been evaluated. Seventeen resistance-trained men (23 ± 1 yr; 13.1 ± 1.5% body fat) were randomly assigned to receive either 330 mg/day of 3β-hydroxy-5α-androst-1-en-17-one (Prohormone; n = 9) or sugar (Placebo; n = 8) per os and complete a 4-wk (16 session) structured resistance-training program. Body composition, muscular strength, circulating lipids, and markers of liver and kidney dysfunction were assessed at study onset and termination. Prohormone increased lean body mass by 6.3 ± 1.2%, decreased fat body mass by 24.6 ± 7.1%, and increased their back squat one repetition maximum and competition total by 14.3 ± 1.5 and 12.8 ± 1.1%, respectively. These improvements exceeded (P < .05) Placebo, which increased lean body mass by .5 ± .8%, reduced fat body mass by 9.5 ± 3.6%, and increased back squat one repetition maximum and competition total by 5.7 ± 1.7 and 5.9 ± 1.7%, respectively. Prohormone also experienced multiple adverse effects. These included a 38.7 ± 4.% reduction in HDL (P < .01), a 32.8 ± .05% elevation in LDL (P < .01), and elevations of 120. ± 22.6 and 77.4 ± 12.% in LDL-to-HDL and cholesterol-to-HDL ratios, respectively (both P < .01). Prohormone also exhibited elevations in serum creatinine (19.6 ± 4.3%; P < .01) and aspartate transaminase (113.8 ± 61.1%; P = .05), as well as reductions in serum albumin (5.1 ± 1.9%; P = .04), alkaline phosphatase (16.4 ± 4.7%; P = .04), and glomerular filtration rate (18. ± 3.3%; P = .04). None of these values changed (all P > .05) in Placebo. The oral  3β-hydroxy-5α-androst-1-en-17-one improves body composition and muscular strength. However, these changes come at a significant cost. Cardiovascular health and liver function are particularly compromised.

Slight and insignificant change in blood volume was observed in most of the tissues and brain regions between vehicle- and PG-administered groups. TU for the three PG was markedly high in kidney and lung (2388-3952 ng/g), exceeding the blood concentration (2021-2320 ng/ml), but low (less than 10% of the blood concentration) in epididymis, epididymal , testis (59-163 ng/g), brain and spinal cord (33-67 ng/g). TU in brain were detected about .1% of the administered PG. Based on a two-compartment model, the  product for the three PG ranged from .75 to 4.16 microliters/g/sec in the latter tissues. The value of brain was 1.22 +/- .18 microliters/g/sec for PGD2, 1.69 +/- .05 for PGE2 and 1.33 +/- .13 for PGF2 alpha, indicating that PGE2 enters the brain more readily than PGD2 and PGF2 alpha. In various brain structures, the ranges of the  product were large and completely overlapped among the three PG (PGD2, .14-1.56 microliters/g/sec; PGE2, .05-1.78; PGF2 alpha, .05-1.82). The highest  product for the three PG was found in olfactory bulb and cerebellum (.96-1.82 microliters/g/sec) and the lowest was in septum (.05-.53). However, the level of the  product was different among the PG in each brain region as follows: PGD2 greater than PGE2, PGF2 alpha in septum and anterior part of pyriform cortex; PGE2 greater than PGD2, PGF2 alpha in olfactory bulb, frontal cortex, basal forebrain, middle part of pyriform cortex, thalamus, hippocampus and lateral neocortex; and PGF2 alpha greater than PGD2, PGE2 in posterior part of pyriform cortex, hypothalamus, amygdala and entorhinal and retrosplenial cortices. Low correlation coefficients (.708, .522 and .562 for PGD2, PGE2 and PGF2 alpha, respectively) between the  product and cerebrovascular volume in various regions revealed heterogeneous cerebrovascular permeabilities of PG.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8640202>Effects of weight cycling on the resting energy expenditure and body composition of obese women.</a></h1><p>Numerous reports have suggested that cycles of weight loss and regain (i.e., weight cycling) are associated with adverse health consequences, a concern that may lead some obese individuals to forgo weight control efforts. The present study examined whether weight cycling was associated with a reduction in resting energy expenditure (REE) and with increases in both total and upper body .REE, body composition, and body  distribution were measured before and after weight loss, and following full weight regain, in 12 women who before treatment had a mean (+/- SEM) age of 38.8 +/- 3.4 years and weight of 98. +/- 3.2 kg.At the end of treatment, patients lost 18.9 +/- 2.6 kg which was comprised of significant decreases in body  and -free mass of .2 +/- 2.2 and 3.7 +/- .8 kg, respectively (both  < .001). REE also fell during this time from 1,631 +/- 82 to 1,501 +/- 51 kcal/d (p < .03). All of these measures, however, returned to their baseline values when patients regained their lost weight. Body  distribution was unchanged throughout the study.These results do not support claims that weight cycling adversely affects REE, body composition, or body  distribution.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22368152>Effects of catecholamine stress on diastolic function and myocardial energetics in obesity.</a></h1><p>Obesity is characterized by impaired cardiac energetics, which may play a role in the development of diastolic dysfunction and inappropriate shortness of breath. We assessed whether, in obesity, derangement of energetics and diastolic function is further altered during acute cardiac stress.Normal-weight (body mass index, 22±2 kg/m(2); n=9-17) and obese (body mass index, 39±7 kg/m(2); n=17-46) subjects underwent assessment of diastolic left ventricular function (cine magnetic resonance imaging volume-time curve analysis) and cardiac energetics (phosphocreatine/ATP ratio; (31)P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy) at rest and during dobutamine stress (heart rate increase, 65±22% and 69±14%, respectively; P=.61). At rest, obesity was associated with a 22% lower peak filling rate (P<.001) and a % lower phosphocreatine/ATP ratio (1.73±.40 versus 2.03±.28; P=.048). Peak filling rate correlated with fat mass, left ventricular mass, leptin, waist-to-hip ratio, and phosphocreatine/ATP ratio. On multivariable analysis, phosphocreatine/ATP was the only independent predictor of peak filling rate (β=.50; P=.03). During stress, a further reduction in phosphocreatine/ATP occurred in obese (from 1.73±.40 to 1.53±.50; P=.03) but not in normal-weight (from 1.98±.24 to 2.04±.34; P=.50) subject. For similar levels of inotropic stress, there were smaller increases in peak filling rate in obesity (38% versus 70%; P=.01).In obesity, cardiac energetics are further deranged during inotropic stress, in association with continued diastolic dysfunction. Myocardial energetics may play a key role in the impairment of diastolic function in obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30405297>Race/Ethnicity-Specific Associations between Smoking, Serum Leptin, and Abdominal : The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.</a></h1><p>Smoking is a well-known cardiovascular risk factor associated with weight loss. We aimed to evaluate the association between smoking, serum leptin levels, and abdominal .Cross-sectional.Data from examinations 2 or 3 (2002-2005) of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).1,875 asymptomatic, community-dwelling adults.We used multivariable linear regression models to assess the race/ethnicity-specific associations between smoking, serum logleptin levels, and computed tomography ascertained abdominal . Results were adjusted for demographic and relevantclinical covariates.Participants (mean age 64.5±9.6 years; 50.6% women; 42.2% former, 11.4% current smokers) were White (40.1%), Hispanic (25.8%), African American (21.1%), and Chinese (13.%). Overall, median (25th - 75th percentile) leptin levels were significantly lower among current (11.14 ng/mL; 4.13 - 26.18) and former smokers (11.68 ng/mL; 4.72 - 27.57), as compared with never smokers (.61 ng/mL; 3.05 - 30.12) (P<.001). The difference in median leptin levels between current and never smokers were significantly higher for Hispanics (Δ9.64 ng/mL) and African Americans (Δ8.81 ng/mL) than Whites (Δ2.10 ng/mL) and Chinese (Δ4.70 ng/mL) (P<.001). After adjustment for total abdominal , log-leptin levels remained lower for former (-.14 [-.22 - -.07]) and current (-.17 [-.28 - -.05]) smokers, compared with never smokers. Results differed by race/ethnicity, with significantly lower log-leptin levels observed only among current and former African Americans and Hispanic smokers, compared with their never smoker counterparts. ( for interaction <.05).Among smokers, leptin levels significantly vary by race/ethnicity. Former and current smoking are associated with lower leptin levels, although this may be restricted to Hispanics and African Americans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20197195>Impact of dietary fat type within the context of altered cholesterol homeostasis on cholesterol and lipoprotein  in the F1B hamster.</a></h1><p>Cholesterol status and dietary fat alter several metabolic pathways reflected in lipoprotein profiles. To assess plasma lipoprotein response and mechanisms by which cholesterol and dietary fat type regulate expression of genes involved in lipoprotein , we developed an experimental model system using F1B hamsters fed diets (12 weeks) enriched in 10% (wt/wt) coconut, olive, or safflower oil with either high cholesterol (.1%; cholesterol supplemented) or low cholesterol coupled with cholesterol-lowering drugs 10 days before killing (.01% cholesterol, .% lovastatin, 2% cholestyramine; cholesterol depleted). Irrespective of dietary fat, cholesterol depletion, relative to supplementation, resulted in lower plasma non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) and HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations (all  < .05). In the liver, these differences were associated with higher sterol regulatory element binding protein-2, low-density lipoprotein receptor, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, and 7α-hydroxylase messenger RNA (mRNA) levels; higher scavenger receptor B1 and apolipoprotein A-I mRNA and protein levels; lower apolipoprotein E protein levels; and in intestine, modestly lower sterol transporters adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) A1, ABCG5, and ABCG8 mRNA levels. Irrespective of cholesterol status, coconut oil, relative to olive and safflower oils, resulted in higher non-HDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations (both  < .05) and modestly higher sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 mRNA levels. These data suggest that, in F1B hamsters, differences in plasma lipoprotein profiles in response to cholesterol depletion are associated with changes in the expression of genes involved in cholesterol , whereas the effect of dietary fat type on gene expression was modest, which limits the usefulness of the experimental animal model.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

LEU is also known to activate protein anabolic signaling pathways independent of insulin. Based on our previous findings in COPD, we hypothesized that whole body protein anabolism is enhanced to a comparable extent by the separate and combined co-ingestion of CHO and LEU with protein.To disentangle the protein anabolic effects of CHO and/or free LEU when co-ingested with a high-quality protein, we studied 10 patients with moderate to very severe COPD and dyspnea (GOLD: II-IV, mMRC dyspnea scale ≥ 2), at risk for muscle loss, and 10 healthy age- and gender-matched controls. On four occasions, in a single-blind randomized crossover design, each subject ingested a drink containing .6 g/kg -free mass (ffm) hydrolyzed casein protein with, a) no add-ons (protein), b) .3 g/kg ffm CHO (protein + CHO), c) .095 g/kg ffm leucine (protein + LEU), d) both add-ons (protein + CHO + LEU). Whole body protein breakdown (PB), protein synthesis (), and net protein balance (=  - PB) were measured by IV primed and continuous infusion of L-[ring-H]-phenylalanine and L-[C,N]-tyrosine. L-[N]-phenylalanine was added to the protein drinks to measure splanchnic extraction.In both groups, whole body , PB and net protein balance responses were comparable between the four protein drinks, despite higher postprandial plasma LEU concentrations for the LEU supplemented drinks (P < .05), and higher insulin concentrations for the CHO supplemented drinks as compared to the protein only drink (P < .05).Adding CHO and/or LEU to a serving of high-quality protein does not further augment whole body protein anabolism in dyspneic COPD patients at risk for muscle loss or healthy older adults.ClinicalTrials.gov; No. ; URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and .

Television (TV) watching, videogame and computer usage, doing homework, and the way students got to school, physical activity, and socioeconomic status were analyzed. Anthropometrics were measured to describe overweight (International Obesity Task Force cutoffs for body mass index) and overfat (body  percentage >85th percentile).When all subjects were considered as an entire group, the overweight risk increased by .8% (P < .05) per increasing hour of TV watching. The overweight risks decreased by 32.5% in females, 22% per increasing year of age, and 12.5% by increasing socioeconomic status by 1 U (all  < .05). The obesity risks decreased with age by 17.8% per year in males and 27.1% in females (both  < .05).

At baseline, the AEX+WL group consumed slightly more protein than the WL group (P<.01). Macronutrient intake did not change following AEX+WL, but the WL group decreased their fat intake and increased their carbohydrates and protein intakes (<.05), which resulted in similar macronutrient intakes between groups post-intervention. Weekday total activity counts decreased 22% (P<.05) following WL. This change tended (P=.07) to be different than the lack of change in non-structured activity observed following AEX+WL.Although similar dietary adherence was observed, these data suggest that postmenopausal women undergoing weight loss may benefit from the addition of exercise to prevent the decline in non-structured activity observed following weight loss alone.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17570256>Impaired proinsulin secretion before and during oral glucose stimulation in HIV-infected patients who display  redistribution.</a></h1><p>The beta-cell function of HIV-infected patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy who display lipodystrophy may be impaired. An early defect in beta-cell function may be characterized by an increase in secretion of 32-33 split proinsulin (SP) and intact proinsulin (IP). To address this issue, the secretion patterns of SP and IP of 16 HIV-infected men with lipodystrophy (LIPO) and  HIV-infected men without lipodystrophy (NONLIPO) were studied during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). All patients received highly active antiretroviral therapy. Insulin secretion rates were determined by deconvolution of plasma C-peptide concentrations. More LIPO than NONLIPO patients displayed diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance than normal glucose tolerance (LIPO 2/8/6 vs NONLIPO 1/2/12, P = .05). LIPO patients had increased fasting levels of SP and IP, ratio of SP/IP, and area under the curve of SP and IP during the early phase (, 10, and 20 minutes) and during the late phase (45, 75, and 105 minutes) of the OGTT compared with NONLIPO patients ( < .05). LIPO patients exhibited significantly increased fasting SP/IP ratio, fasting SP/insulin ratio, and total proinsulin to C-peptide ratio during the OGTT. LIPO patients displayed increased incremental secretion of IP during the first 10 minutes of the OGTT (P < .05), although the incremental insulin secretion during this period did not differ between LIPO and NONLIPO patients. These data suggest that HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy display major perturbations of proinsulin secretion in the fasting state and during an OGTT, which is compatible with the notion of a beta-cell dysfunction of such patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15164845>Determination of plant sterol oxidation products in plant sterol enriched spreads,  blends, and plant sterol concentrates.</a></h1><p>Plant sterols () are very stable molecules but may undergo oxidation due to the presence of a double bond in the ring structure. In order to assess whether this occurs during heating and storage, an analytical procedure was developed for the determination of concentration levels and identity of  oxidation products in functional food ingredients and products. The method is based on cold saponification, solvent extraction of unsaponifiables, isolation of sterol oxidation products by means of liquid chromatography, and final analysis by gas chromatography (GC) with flame ionization detection. Identification of the key  oxidation products was performed by means of GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Isotope dilution MS was used to verify the absence of the formation of potential artifacts by the method. The method described is applicable to spreads (containing 20-65% water), oils, sterol esters, pure sterols, and  extracts from food.

The rats were fed 1 of 4 experimental diets, each containing a different barley variety, for 11 d. The diets had a content of , 2.1, 2.6 and 4.3 g of β-glucan/100 g. Feed intake and faecal excretion of fat, protein, starch, and non-starch polysaccharides were determined in the final 5 d of the study and apparent macronutrient digestibility calculated.

Criterion measures taken at baseline (Pre) and after the exercise program (Post) included anthropometric data, dietary assessment, nitrogen balance, nitrogen flux (Q), protein synthesis (), protein breakdown (PB) and net protein balance [(Net) =  - PB]. After the walking program, there were no significant changes in body weight, -free mass or percentage of body , whereas height increased (P < .01). Energy and protein intakes were constant throughout the study. Nitrogen balance was significantly more positive Post than Pre (P < .05). There was a significant decrease in Q (P < .0001) with corresponding decreases in  (P < .001) and PB (P < .01). These data provide the first evidence that programmed aerobic exercise alters whole-body protein utilization in healthy, nonobese children.

The type of dietary protein may modulate postprandial .We studied the effect of dietary protein type on postprandial changes in the metabolome after a high- meal.In a 3-period, crossover, postprandial study, 10 healthy overweight men with an elevated waist circumference (>94 cm) ingested high- meals made up of cream  (70% of energy), sucrose (% energy), and protein (% energy) from either casein (CAS), whey protein (WHE), or α-lactalbumin-enriched whey protein (LAC). Urine collected immediately before and 2, 4, and 6 h after the meal was analyzed for metabolomics, a secondary outcome of the clinical study. We used mixed-effect models, partial least-square regression, and pathway enrichment analysis.At 4 and 6 h after the meal, the postprandial metabolome was found to be fully discriminated according to protein type. We identified 17 metabolites that significantly explained the effect of protein type on postprandial metabolomic changes (protein-time interaction). Among this signature, acylcarnitines and other acylated metabolites related to fatty acid or amino acid oxidation were the main discriminant features. The difference in metabolic profiles was mainly explained by urinary acylcarnitines and some other acylated products (protein type,  < .0001), with a dramatically greater increase (100- to 1000-fold) after WHE, and to a lesser extent after LAC, as compared with CAS. Pathway enrichment analysis confirmed that the type of protein had modified fatty acid oxidation (P < .05).Taken together, our results indicate that, in healthy overweight men, the type of protein in a high- meal interplays with fatty acid oxidation with a differential accumulation of incomplete oxidation products. A high- meal containing WHE, but not CAS, resulted in this outpacing of the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

Subjects were defined as having NAFLD when they had higher scores from previously validated NAFLD prediction models such as the hepatic steatosis index, comprehensive NAFLD score and NAFLD liver fat score. BARD and FIB-4 scores were used to define advanced fibrosis in subjects with NAFLD. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) [SMI(%)=total appendicular skeletal muscle mass (kg)/weight (kg)×100] measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to diagnose sarcopaenia with cut points of 32.2% for men and 25.5% for women.SMI was inversely correlated with all NAFLD predicting scores (<.001). After stratification, sarcopaenic subjects had an increased risk of NAFLD regardless of obesity (odds ratios [ORs]=1.55 to 3.02, depending on models; all <.001) or metabolic syndrome (ORs=1.63 to 4.00, all <.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis also demonstrated this independent association between sarcopaenia and NAFLD after adjusting for confounding factors related to obesity or insulin resistance (ORs=1.18 to 1.22, all <.001). Furthermore, among the NAFLD population, subjects with lower SMIs were likely to have advanced fibrosis compared with non-sarcopaenic individuals (BARD and FIB-4: ORs=1.83 and 1.69, respectively; both <.001). Compared with non-exercised subjects, individuals who exercised regularly had a lower risk of NAFLD (p<.001), particularly among obese people with well-preserved muscle mass.Sarcopaenia is associated with increased risks of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis, independent of obesity or metabolic control.Copyright © 2015 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Seventy-five male Golden Syrian hamsters, weighing 100 to 120 g, were fed a regular rodent chow for 2 weeks before being randomly assigned into 5 groups of  animals each fed semisynthetic diets for 4 weeks. Group 1 was given a control diet that contained .25% cholesterol and 5%  with a polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids ratio of .4. Groups 2 to 5 were fed the control diet and given 25 mg/kg BW per day of VLCFA (Licowax) (VLCFA25), 50 mg/kg BW per day of VLCFA (VLCFA50), 25 mg/kg BW per day of VLCFA+1000 mg/kg BW per day of LT (VLCFA25/LT), and 25 mg/kg BW per day of VLCFA+1000 mg/kg BW per day of  (Cholestatin, VLCFA25/), respectively. Results showed that HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were not changed by VLCFA25, although increased by VLCFA50 (P<.05) relative to control. Total cholesterol (T-C) and non-HDL-C levels were not affected by VLCFA25 and VLCFA50 as compared with control. VLCFA25/LT had higher (P<.02) T-C and HDL-C levels than any other treatments and increased (P<.05) liver weight relative to control. In contrast, VLCFA25/ reduced T-C (P=.0004) and non-HDL-C (P=.007) without effect on HDL-C levels compared with control. Triglyceride levels were not affected by any treatment. Cholesterol biosynthesis rate was higher (P<.05) in animals fed VLCFA25 and VLCFA50 than those fed control or VLCFA25/LT or VLCFA25/. Results suggest that PSs can decrease total and non-HDL-C cholesterol, whereas VLCFA may increase HDL-C in hamsters.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19274786>Exocrine pancreatic function testing in patients with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic sufficiency: a correlation study.</a></h1><p>Most patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have pancreatic insufficiency; however, % of the patients are pancreatic sufficient (). Several laboratory tests have been developed to distinguish between pancreatic insufficiency and . The gold standard to determine pancreatic function apart from direct pancreatic stimulation test is the 72-hour fecal  excretion, expressed as coefficient of  absorption (CFA). The aim was to test the correlation between 2 other tests, fecal elastase-1 and serum immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT), as compared with fecal  excretion.21 patients with CF- performed the 3 tests of fecal  excretion, fecal elastase-1, and IRT. Correlation between the tests was evaluated by the kappa statistics test, sensitivity and specificity, and positive and negative predictive values.CFA was abnormal in 5 patients, elastase was <200microg/g in 4 patients, and IRT was <20 ng/mL in 2 patients. The correlation between CFA and IRT was negative(kappa=-.154), and between CFA and fecal elastase-1 was poor (kappa=.213). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of IRT versus CFA were %, 88%, %, and 78%, and for fecal elastase-1 were 40%, 81%, 40%, and 81%, respectively.In CF-, poor correlation was found between IRT, fecal elastase-1, and CFA, therefore neither fecal elastase-1 in the stool nor IRT in the serum reaches the sensitivity or the specificity of the fecal  excretion. Thus, fecal  excretion is required in patients with CF for evaluation of pancreatic function.</p></html>
