<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670628>Developing evidence-based behavioural strategies to overcome physiological resistance to weight loss in the general population.</a></h2><p>Physiological and behavioural systems are tolerant of excess energy intake and responsive to energy deficits. Weight loss (WL) changes body structure, physiological function and energy balance (EB) behaviours, which resist further WL and promote subsequent weight regain. Measuring and understanding the response of EB systems to energy deficits is important for developing evidence-based behaviour change interventions for longer-term weight management. Currently, behaviour change approaches for longer-term WL show modest effect sizes. Self-regulation of EB behaviours (e.g. goal setting, action plans, self-monitoring, relapse prevention plans) and aspects of motivation are important for WL maintenance. Stress management, emotion regulation and food hedonics may also be important for relapse prevention, but the evidence is less concrete. Although much is known about the effects of WL on physiological and psychological function, little is known about the way these dynamic changes affect human EB behaviours. Key areas of future importance include (i) improved methods for detailed tracking of energy expenditure, balance and by subtraction intake, using digital technologies, (ii) how WL impacts body structure, function and subsequent EB behaviours, (iii) how behaviour change approaches can overcome physiological resistance to WL and (iv) who is likely to maintain WL or relapse. Modelling physiological and psychological moderators and mediators of EB-related behaviours is central to understanding and improving longer-term weight and health outcomes in the general population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666856>Knowledge of Obstructive Sleep Apnea among Dental Fraternity in Riyadh.</a></h2><p>To assess and compare the knowledge of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) among final years dental students, interns, dental practitioners and faculty working in and around Riyadh.A questionnaire-based study comprising of 16 questions was conducted among final year dental clinical students, interns, dental practitioners and faculty working in and around Riyadh. Statistical Package for Social Sciences software (SPSS version 21) was used to analyse the statistical data. The p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.A total of 450 respondents took part in the study. When gender comparison was done regarding the awareness of OSA, statistically significant differences were noted for the majority of questions. The response rate for the knowledge-based questions varied statistically concerning their speciality and educational qualifications. 65% of the participants admitted that they were unaware of the diagnostic tests performed for diagnosing these patients. It was noted that 85% of the participants wanted to attend a CDE program to know more about OSA.The study concludes that there is a significant lack of knowledge among final year students, interns and general dentists. This study emphasises the need for all dental professionals to regularly update their knowledge and equip themselves to identify and treat such patients at an early stage.Copyright: © 2019 Lingam Amara Swapna, Noora Fahad Alotaibi, Samah Abdulrahman Falatah, Meznah saad al Joaithen, Pradeep Koppolu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673283>Weight loss in conservative treatment of  in women is associated with physical activity and circadian phenotype: a longitudinal observational study.</a></h2><p>The study investigates the association between circadian phenotype (CP), its stability (interdaily stability - IS) and physical activity (PA) in a weight loss (WL) programme.Seventy-five women in WL conservative treatment (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) were measured (for about 3 months in between 2016 and 2018) by actigraphy.We observed a difference in time of acrophase ( = 0.049), but no difference in IS ( = 0.533) between women who lost and did not lose weight. There was a difference in PA (mesor) between groups of women who lost weight compared to those who gained weight ( = 0.007). There was a relationship between IS and PA parametres mesor: p0.001; and the most active 10 h of a day (M10):  < 0.001 - the more stable were women in their rhythm, the more PA they have. Besides confirming a relationship between PA and WL, we also found a relation between WL and CP based on acrophase. Although no direct relationship was found for the indicators of rhythm stability (IS), they can be considered very important variables because of their close connection to PA - a main factor that contributes to the success of the WL programme.According to the results of the study, screening of the CP and its stability may be beneficial in the creation of an individualized WL plan.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675433>Simultaneous angiotensin receptor blockade and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor activation ameliorate albuminuria in obese insulin-resistant rats.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance increases renal oxidant production by up-regulating NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) expression contributing to oxidative damage and ultimately albuminuria. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and activation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor signaling may reverse this effect. However, whether angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1) blockade and GLP-1 receptor activation improve oxidative damage and albuminuria through different mechanisms is not known. Using insulin resistant Otsuka Long Evan Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, we tested the hypothesis that simultaneous blockade of AT1 and activation of GLP-1r additively decrease oxidative damage and urinary albumin excretion (U V) in the following groups: (1) untreated, lean LETO (n=7), (2) untreated, obese OLETF (n=9), (3) OLETF + angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB; 10 mg olmesartan /kg/d; n=9), (4) OLETF + GLP-1 mimetic (EXE; 10 ug exenatide/kg/d; n=7), and (5) OLETF + ARB + exenatide (Combo; n=6). Mean kidney Nox4 protein expression and nitrotyrosine (NT) levels were 30% and 46% greater, respectively, in OLETF compared to LETO. Conversely, Nox4 protein expression and NT were reduced to LETO levels in ARB and EXE, and Combo reduced Nox4, NT, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal levels by 21%, 27%, and 27%, respectively. At baseline, U V was nearly double in OLETF compared to LETO, and increased to nearly 10-fold greater levels by the end of the study. While ARB (45%) and EXE (55%) individually reduced U V, the combination completely ameliorated the albuminuria. Collectively, these data suggest that AT1 blockade and GLP-1 receptor activation reduce renal oxidative damage similarly during insulin resistance, while targeting both signaling pathways provides added benefit in restoring and/or further ameliorating albuminuria in a model of diet-induced .© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668310>Glucose and Insulin Responses to an Intravenous Glucose Load in Thoroughbred and Paso Fino Horses.</a></h2><p>Certain breeds of horses may be genetically predisposed to developing insulin dysregulation, which is a risk factor for development of endocrinopathic laminitis in horses. This study was performed to test the hypotheses that Paso Fino horses exhibit evidence of insulin dysregulation compared with Thoroughbred horses and that  exaggerates the insulin dysregulation. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed in 14 moderate-weight Thoroughbreds, 12 moderate-weight Paso Finos, and 12 overweight Paso Finos. Moderate Paso Finos had greater baseline serum insulin concentrations, area under the insulin concentration curve, peak insulin, insulin-to-glucose ratio, area under the insulin to glucose curve, and modified glucose-to-insulin ratio compared with moderate Thoroughbreds. The reciprocal inverse square of basal insulin (RISQI) and glucose-to-insulin ratio were significantly lower in moderate Paso Finos compared with moderate Thoroughbreds. Overweight Paso Finos had greater baseline insulin concentrations, area under the insulin concentration curve, time to peak insulin, baseline plasma glucose concentration, insulin-to-glucose ratio, and area under the insulin to glucose curve compared with moderate Paso Finos. The RISQI and glucose-to-insulin ratio were significantly lower in overweight Paso Finos compared with moderate Paso Finos. In conclusion, moderate-weight Paso Finos had higher baseline serum insulin concentrations and an excessive hyperinsulinemic response to an intravenous glucose load when compared with moderate-weight Thoroughbreds. Overweight Paso Finos had even greater baseline insulin concentrations and hyperinsulinemic responses to glucose compared with moderate Paso Finos, as well as greater baseline plasma glucose concentrations. Paso Finos exhibit insulin dysregulation compared with Thoroughbreds.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Predicting its progression could help clinicians manage and potentially prevent complications. We evaluated the independent and joint effects of metabolic traits on the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients with NAFLD. We assembled a retrospective cohort of patients with NAFLD diagnosed at 130 facilities in the Veterans Administration between 1/1/2004 and 12/31/2008 with follow-up through 12/31/2015. We performed competing risk, adjusted cause-specific Cox models to evaluate the effects of metabolic traits (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, ) as additive or combined indicators on time to develop cirrhosis or HCC or a composite endpoint of both. Of the 271,906 patients, 22,794 developed cirrhosis, and 253 developed HCC during a mean of 9 years follow up. At baseline, the mean BMI was 31.6 (SD, 5.6), 28.7% had diabetes, 70.3% hypertension, and 62.3% had dyslipidemia with substantial overlap among the these traits. The risk of progression was the lowest in patients with only one or no metabolic trait. There was a stepwise increase in risk with each additional metabolic trait. Compared to patients with no metabolic trait, patients with both hypertension and dyslipidemia had 1.8-fold higher risk of progression to cirrhosis/HCC (hazard ratio (HR) =1.8, 95% CI=1.59-2.06); the risk was 2.6-fold higher in patients with diabetes, , dyslipidemia and hypertension (HR=2.6, 95% CI=2.3,2.9). These associations were stronger for HCC. Diabetes had the strongest association with HCC in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Each additional metabolic trait increased the risk of cirrhosis and HCC in patients with NAFLD. Diabetes conferred the highest risk of progression to HCC. Diabetic patients with co-existing hypertension and  may be important targets for secondary prevention.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672599>Heptamethoxyflavone inhibits adipogenesis via enhancing PKA signaling.</a></h2><p>3,5,6,7,8,3',4'-heptamethoxyflavone (HMF), a naturally occurring polymethoxyflavone found in citrus peel, is known to have neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. However, the effects of HMF on adipogenesis remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that HMF inhibits the early stage of adipogenesis and maturation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. HMF treatment during preadipocyte differentiation for 8 days reduced lipid accumulation in a dose-dependent manner, and the expression levels of key adipogenic transcription factors (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα)) and the lipogenic transcription factor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP1), were lower after the initial 4 days of the differentiation. Moreover, PPARγ expression level was lower even after the initial 2 days, but C/EBPα and SREBP1 expression was not. HMF upregulated the phosphorylation of protein kinase A catalytic subunit α (PKACα), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in 3T3-L1 cells. The phosphorylation of ACC leads to the inhibition of adipogenesis. Furthermore, the induction of phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC by HMF was abolished by RNA interference targeting PKACα. Taken together, our results suggest that HMF might inhibit the early stage of adipogenesis via the activation of PKA signaling in 3T3-L1 cells.Copyright © 2019.

It has been suggested that earlier puberty is a consequence of higher levels of estrogen due to increased aromatization of androgens in adipose tissue. Thus, we aimed to assess the relation between serum levels of estrogen and excess weight (BMI ≥1SD) and central adiposity (>75th percentile for waist circumference) in prepubertal girls at age 7.: We conducted a cross-sectional study within the Growth and  Cohort Study of 1190 low-middle income children from Santiago, Chile. We selected a random sample of 107 prepubertal girls at age 7. A trained dietitian measured weight, height and waist circumference. Additionally, a fasting blood sample was collected to measure serum levels of estradiol equivalents (via ultrasensitive recombinant cell bioassay), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and leptin.: Excess weight was observed in 40% of our sample; 11.2% had high central adiposity, and the mean level of estradiol equivalents was 3.6 ± 2.3 pg/ml. In the univariate and multivariate analyzes, we did not observe an association between excess weight, central adiposity and estradiol equivalent levels; however, insulin was inversely associated with the serum level of estradiol equivalents.: Our participants had a mean level of estradiol equivalents of 3.6 pg/ml (±2.3 pg/ml) at the pre-pubertal stage.

Metabolic challenges such as the one posed by high fructose intake are important determinants of disease mechanisms. We embarked on studies to determine how fructose affects differential metabolic dysfunctions across genetically dissimilar mice, namely, C57BL/6 J (B6), DBA/2 J (DBA) and FVB/NJ (FVB), by integrating physiological and gene regulatory mechanisms. We report that fructose has strain-specific effects, involving tissue-specific gene regulatory cascades in hypothalamus, liver, and white adipose tissues. DBA mice showed the largest numbers of genes associated with adiposity, congruent with their highest susceptibility to adiposity gain and glucose intolerance across the three tissues. In contrast, B6 and FVB mainly exhibited cholesterol phenotypes, accompanying the largest number of adipose genes correlating with total cholesterol in B6, and liver genes correlating with LDL in FVB mice. Tissue-specific network modeling predicted strain-and tissue-specific regulators such as Fgf21 (DBA) and Lss (B6), which were subsequently validated in primary hepatocytes. Strain-specific fructose-responsive genes revealed susceptibility for human diseases such that genes in liver and adipose tissue in DBA showed strong enrichment for human type 2 diabetes and  traits. Liver and adipose tissues genes in FVB were mostly related to lipid traits, and liver and adipose genes in B6 showed relevance to most cardiometabolic traits tested. Our results show that fructose induces gene regulatory pathways that are tissue specific and dependent on the genetic make-up, which may underlie interindividual variability in cardiometabolic responses to high fructose consumption.Copyright © 2019.

Thus, DOAC therapy in this population remains controversial.  To investigate rivaroxaban as a safe and effective alternative to warfarin for venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment and prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation identified as extremely obese or of high body weight.  A retrospective chart review was performed at 2 academic medical centers in patients ≥18 years old and BMI >40 kg/m or weight >120 kg, newly initiated on warfarin or rivaroxaban for atrial fibrillation or VTE treatment. The primary end point was incidence of clinical failure, defined as VTE recurrence, stroke incidence, and mortality, within 12 months of initiation. Secondary end points included length of stay (LOS) and bleeding complications.  A total of 176 patients were included, with 84 and 92 patients in the rivaroxaban and warfarin arms, respectively. Clinical failure was lower in the rivaroxaban group but did not reach statistical significance when compared with warfarin (5% vs 13%;  = 0.06). LOS was significantly shorter in the rivaroxaban arm (2 days [1-3] vs 4 days [2-7],  < 0.0001). Percentage of bleeding complications was higher in the rivaroxaban arm but not statistically significant (8% vs 2%,  = 0.06).

The drugs used to treat these conditions are largely inadequate or dangerous, and a well-researched approach based on nutraceuticals would be highly useful. Pterostilbene (Pt), i.e., 3,5-dimethylresveratrol, has been reported to be effective in animal models of , acting on different metabolic pathways. We investigate here its ability to induce browning of white adipose tissue. Pt (5 µM) was first tested on 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes, and then it was administered (352 µmol/kg/day) to mice fed an obesogenic high-fat diet (HFD) for 30 weeks, starting at weaning. In the cultured adipocytes, the treatment elicited a significant increase of the levels of Uncoupling Protein 1 (UCP1) protein-a key component of thermogenic, energy-dissipating beige/brown adipocytes. In vivo administration antagonized weight increase, more so in males than in females. Analysis of inguinal White Adipose Tissue (WAT) revealed a trend towards browning, with significantly increased transcription of several marker genes (, , , , , and ) and an increase in UCP1 protein levels, which, however, did not achieve significance.

N = 412 patients underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) to assess the presence and characteristics of coronary atherosclerosis. A CTA score, combining extent, severity, composition, and location of plaques was computed.Patients were divided according to PCSK9 quartiles: I (< 136 ng/mL), II-III (136-266 ng/mL), and IV quartile (> 266 ng/mL). Compared with patients in quartile IV, patients in quartile I had a higher prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and higher values of body mass index. LDL- and HDL-cholesterol were significantly lower in patients in the quartile I than in those in quartile IV. Coronary CTA documented normal vessels in 30% and obstructive CAD in 35% of cases without differences among PCSK9 quartiles. Compared with patients with the highest levels, patients with the lowest PCSK9 levels had a higher CTA score mainly due to higher number of mixed non-obstructive coronary plaques. At multivariable analysis including clinical, medications, and lipid variables, PCSK9 was an independent predictor of the CTA score (coefficient - 0.129, SE 0.03, P < 0.0001), together with age, male gender, statins, interleukin-6, and leptin.In patients with stable CAD, low PCSK9 plasma levels are associated with a particular metabolic phenotype (low HDL cholesterol, the metabolic syndrome, , insulin resistance and diabetes) and diffuse non-obstructive coronary atherosclerosis.

Maternal feeding practices, maternal disordered eating, and child temperament were assessed as potential mediators of early weight gain in babies of smoking and non-smoking mothers. The BMIs of babies of 88 smoking and 107 non-smoking mothers were recorded at birth and reported one year later. Mothers self-reported on disordered eating and child feeding practices, and on their infants' temperament. Babies of smoking mothers had lower BMI at birth but not at age one. For babies of non-smoking but not for those of smoking mothers, BMI at birth predicted BMI at age one. Smoking mothers' disordered eating and pressure for children to eat predicted their babies' BMI at age one. In the non-smoking group only, there were significant correlations between babies' temperamental difficulties and babies' BMI at age one. In contrast to non-smoking mothers, smoking mothers tend to pressure their babies to eat, and not to feed them in response to their distress.

Studies on SCD1 deficiency in mouse models demonstrated beneficial metabolic phenotypes such as reduced adiposity and improved glucose tolerance. Even though, SCD1 represents a potential target to resolve  related metabolic diseases; SCD1 deficiency causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activates unfolded protein response (UPR). The induction of ER stress in response to SCD1 deficiency is governed by the cofactor, PGC-1α. However, the mechanism by which SCD1 deficiency increases PGC-1α and subsequently induces ER stress still remains elusive. The present study demonstrates that despite reduced lipogenesis, liver specific SCD1 deficiency activates the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) along with induction of PGC-1α and ER stress. Further, mTORC1 inhibition attenuates SCD1 deficiency-mediated induction of both PGC-1α and ER stress. Similar observations were seen by restoring endogenously synthesized oleate, but not palmitoleate, suggesting a clear mTORC1-mediated regulation of ER stress during SCD1 deficiency. Overall, our results suggest a model whereby maintaining adequate levels of hepatic oleate is required to suppress mTORC1-mediated ER stress. In addition, the activation of mTORC1 by SCD1 deficiency reveals an important function of fatty acids in regulating different cellular processes through mTORC1 signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666662>Prevalence and risk factors of childhood hypertension from birth through childhood: a retrospective cohort study.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of childhood hypertension is recognized as an important parameter of cardiovascular risk in adults.

Non-Hispanic Black and less-acculturated Hispanic adolescents were more likely than non-Hispanic White adolescents to engage with brands. Approximately one-half reported engaging with brands of fast food (54% of participants), sugary drinks (50%), candy (46%), and snacks (45%), while just 7% reported engaging with all other categories of food/beverage brands. Watching TV more than 2 h-per-day was associated with any brand engagement; while using other screens more than 4 h-per-day was associated with following 5 + brands.Engagement with unhealthy food brands on social media is common among adolescents. Disproportionate engagement by non-Hispanic Black and less-acculturated Hispanic youth raises additional concerns. Research is needed to understand how such marketing affects adolescents' food preferences, diets, and health.Copyright © 2019.

The aim of this scoping review is to explore the mechanisms by which  and reduced mobility contribute the development of a VLU in patients with Chronic Venous Disease (CVD).For this scoping review a search was performed in May 2019 in the Cochrane Library and Pubmed to identify studies on the working mechanisms of  and mobility in developing a VLU. Hand searches were performed to find additional studies explaining the working mechanisms (indirectly related to the VLU). Two reviewers independently reviewed the abstracts and full-text articles.Twenty-eight studies met our eligibility criteria. Disturbed range of ankle motion and gait can lead to a reduced Calf Muscle Pump (CMP) function which leading to a venous outflow disorder. Increased abdominal pressure due to  can lead to a venous outflow obstruction and increased adipose tissue mass results in an increase in adipokine secretion. The venous outflow disorder, outflow obstruction and increased adipokine secretion can all lead to chronic systemic inflammation, increased endothelial permeability and hence microcirculatory dysfunction. This alone can result in a VLU. and reduced mobility can lead to a reduction of the CMP function, an increase in abdominal pressure and an increase in adipose tissue mass. This can simultaneously lead to haemodynamic changes in the macro- and microcirculation of the lower extremities and eventually in a VLU. In patients with  and reduced mobility the microcirculation alone can lead to skin changes and eventually a VLU. Therefore, early recognition of CVD symptoms in patients with  and reduced mobility is crucial to diagnose and treat CVD to prevent a VLU.Copyright © 2019 Tissue Viability Society.

Unsurprisingly, disruptions of the circadian rhythms through sleep curtailment or shift work have been connected through numerous studies to positive associations with , insulin resistance, and diabetes. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) measures oscillation in messenger RNA expression, an essential foundation for the study of the physiological circadian regulatory network. Primarily, measured oscillations have involved the use of reference gene normalization. However, the validation and identification of suitable reference genes is a significant challenge across different biological systems. This study focuses on adipose tissue of premenopausal, otherwise healthy, morbidly obese women voluntarily enrolled after being scheduled for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery. Acquisition of tissue was accomplished by aspiratory needle biopsies of subcutaneous adipose tissue 1 to 2 weeks prior to surgery and 12 to 13 weeks following surgery and an in-surgery scalpel-assisted excision of mesenteric adipose tissue. Each biopsy was sterile cultured ex vivo and serially collected every 4 h over approximately 36 h. The candidate reference genes that were tested were 18S rRNA, GAPDH, HPRT1, RPII, RPL13α, and YWHAZ. Three analytic tools were used to test suitability, and the candidate reference genes were used to measure oscillation in expression of a known circadian clock element (Dbp). No gene was deemed suitable as an individual reference gene control, which indicated that the optimal reference gene set was the geometrically averaged 3-gene panel composed of YWHAZ, RPL13α, and GAPDH. These methods can be employed to identify optimal reference genes in other systems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666844>The Association between  and Severity of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever in Children at Wangaya General Hospital.</a></h2><p>Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease caused by any one of four closely related Dengue virus (DENV 1-4).

Despite the critical role of the taste system in determining food selection and consumption, the effects of chronic sucrose consumption on the peripheral taste system in mammals have received limited attention. We offered female Sprague Dawley rats free access to water and one of three diets for up to 40 days: (1) sucrose-free chow or "NS" diet; (2) a high-sucrose dry diet or "HS"; or (3) 30% sucrose solution and the NS diet, designated "LiqS" diet. Sucrose consumption by LiqS rats gradually increased and by day 14 was equal to that of HS rats. Food intake decreased in LiqS rats, but their energy intake remained higher than for NS or HS rats. There was no significant difference in weight gain of the groups during the study. Recordings from the chorda tympani nerve (CT), which innervates taste buds on the anterior tongue, revealed decreased responses to 1 M sucrose in both LiqS and HS rats and to acesulfame K and salt tastants in LiqS rats after 40 days on diet. Umami, bitter, and acid response magnitudes were unchanged in both groups. These results demonstrate that chronic sucrose exposure inhibits taste responses to higher concentrations of sweet stimuli. More surprisingly, CT responses to NaCl and 0.5M NaAc were significantly reduced in rats on the LiqS diet. Thus, the physical form of the diet influences taste responsiveness to salt and sweet taste function. These data suggest that taste buds are previously unappreciated targets of chronic sucrose consumption.Copyright © 2019.

Furthermore, -related adipokines have been shown to be closely related to the incidence of CRC, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of high-fat diet-induced adipokines and cytokines on the development of CRC in vitro and in vivo. For the in-vivo assays, we divided 2-week-old C57BL/6J-ApcMin/J male mice into three groups: normal-fat diet (ND), high-fat and high-sugar feed (HFHS), and high-fat and low-sugar feed (HFLS). After 1 week, all mice were injected with 20 mg/kg 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine once weekly for 10 consecutive weeks. Body weight, liver weight, epididymal fat weight, and blood glucose level were greatly increased in HFHS and HFLS groups compared with the ND group, and the expression levels of some adipokines and cytokines were obviously higher in HFHS or HFLS mice compared to ND mice. For the in-vitro assays, HCT116 CRC cells were treated with sera of ND, HFHS, or HFLS groups, or serum-free media (SFM) as a negative control. We observed that sera derived from HFHS or HFLS mice that contain excess adipokines and cytokines promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCT116 cells compared with ND-sera-conditioned medium or SFM group. Therefore, high-fat diet-induced adipokines and cytokines may promote the progression of CRC in vivo and in vitro.© 2019 The Authors.

The associations between prediagnostic total WCC and its subtypes and risk of all-cause, cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality were assessed. The role of WCC related with smoking and BMI on mortality was further explored. Multivariate Cox regression models were performed to estimate the HR and 95% CI.After an average follow-up of 15.8 years, a total of 936 death cases were identified (466 cancer; 179 CVD; 291 other causes). Statistically significant graded associations between total WCC, and counts of lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils and risk of total mortality were observed. These associations were more apparent in current smokers. Strong associations for all-cause mortality or cancer mortality were observed in subjects with BMI ≥25 kg/m, ever smoking and elevated WCC (HR 3.92, 95% CI 2.76 to 5.57; HR 3.93, 95% CI 2.30 to 6.72). WCC partly mediated the associations between smoking or BMI and all-cause mortality.Prediagnostic WCC and its subtypes are associated with all-cause, cancer and CVD mortality risk.

Postmenopausal women were divided into two groups based on the presence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) as MetS+ and MetS-. Comparisons of clinical and metabolic characteristics were performed between the groups.The current study included 200 postmenopausal women and 63 subjects were diagnosed as having MetS. Postmenopausal women with MetS demonstrated significantly higher values with respect to systolic and diastolic blood pressures, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), triglyceride (TG), lipid ratios, Homeostasis Model Assessment Insulin Resistance (HOMA) index, TG glucose (TyG), Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI), and lipid accumulation product (LAP) when compared with women without MetS. Correlation analyses showed that LAP and VAI were positively correlated with waist circumference, WHR, BMI, TG, lipid ratios, TyG and HOMA index, and with each other. LAP was also positively correlated with blood pressures.Visceral adiposity indicators may be useful as predictors of MetS in postmenopausal women.©Copyright 2019 by Turkish Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology | Turkish Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology published by Galenos Publishing House.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670177>Maternal sociodemographic and health behaviours associated with adiposity in infants as measured by air displacement plethysmography.</a></h2><p>Identifying modifiable factors associated with body fat in infancy may improve health outcomes.

Similar experiments were also performed with leptin-deficient (Ob/Ob) mice.The results showed that the HFD group presented decreased GLUT2, PEPT1, FAT/CD36 and NPC1L1, and increased NHE3, MTTP and L-FABP content. Animals fed an HFD also presented enhanced lipid transporter gene expression of , , ,  and . Additionally, FAT/CD36 and NPC1L1 protein levels were reduced in both HFD-induced obese and Ob/Ob mice. Ob/Ob mice also exhibited increased  and  mRNAs expression, but the protein expression levels remained unchanged. The HFD also attenuated PKA and PKC activities. The inhibition of PKA was associated with decreased FAT/CD36 content, whereas increased L-FABP levels likely depend on CREB activation, independent of PKA. It is plausible that the HFD-induced changes in NPC1L1, MTTP and L-FABP protein content involve regulation at the level of transcription. Moreover, the changes in GLUT2 and PEPT1 content might be associated with low PKC activity.The results indicated that an HFD is capable of reducing nutrient transporter content, possibly attenuating nutrient uptake into the intestine, and may represent a feedback mechanism for regulating body weight. Furthermore, the elevated levels of NHE3, L-FABP and MTTP may account for the increased prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia in obese individuals. All of these changes are potentially linked to reduced PKA or PKC activities.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672576>Performance of a selective screening strategy for diagnosis of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy as defined by IADPSG/WHO criteria.</a></h2><p>Our study evaluated the performance of a selective screening strategy for hyperglycaemia in pregnancy (HIP) based on the presence of risk factors (RFs; body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m², age ≥ 35 years, family history of diabetes, personal history of HIP or macrosomia) to diagnose HIP and to predict HIP-related events.Women with no known diabetes who had undergone complete universal screening (early, before 22 weeks of gestation or, if not, in the second part of pregnancy) at our department (2012-2016) were selected, resulting in four groups of women according to the presence of HIP and/or RFs, with a predefined composite endpoint (preeclampsia or large-for-gestational-age infant or shoulder dystocia).Included were 4518 women: 23.5% had HIP and 71.1% had at least one RF. The distribution among our four groups was: HIP-/RF- (n = 1144); HIP-/RF+ (n = 2313); HIP+/RF- (n = 163); and HIP+/RF+ (n = 898). HIP was more frequent when RFs were present rather than absent (33.1% vs 15.4%, respectively; P < 0.001).

IRE1 possesses both Ser/Thr protein kinase and endoribonuclease (RNase) activities within its cytoplasmic domain and is activated through autophosphorylation and dimerization/oligomerization. It mediates a critical arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR) to manage ER stress provoked by lumenal overload of unfolded/misfolded proteins. Emerging lines of evidence have revealed that in mammals, IRE1α functions as a multifunctional signal transducer that responds to metabolic cues and nutrient stress conditions, exerting profound and broad effects on metabolic homeostasis. In this review, we cover recent advances in our understanding of how IRE1α integrates a variety of metabolic and stress signals and highlight its tissue-specific or context-dependent metabolic activities. We also discuss how dysregulation of this metabolic stress sensor during handling of excessive nutrients in cells contributes to the progression of  and metabolic disorders.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666462>Morphometric analysis of paramylon particles produced by Euglena gracilis EOD-1 using FIB/SEM tomography.</a></h2><p>Euglena gracilis EOD-1, a microalgal strain, produces large quantities of paramylon, a class of polymers known as β-1, 3-glucans and has been reported to function as a dietary fiber and to improve the metabolic syndrome including . However, despite its importance, the morphometric analysis of paramylon has not been conducted so far. In this study, we attempted to observe the detailed three-dimensional structure of paramylon by focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM). Paramylon samples were fixed and three-dimensional image reconstruction and segmentation of the image stack were created using computer software (Amira v6.0.1, FEI). The results indicated that the inside of paramylon particles (diameter: 5μm, thickness: 3μm) was comprised of a dense structure with no evidence of the presence of large pores and gaps, although a small 100 nm crack was observed. The specific surface area of paramylon particles measured by the BET method, was not as large as activated charcoal, but similar to those of plant starches, indicating that the cholesterol-lowering effect of paramylon cannot be simply attributed to its adsorption ability. The FIB/SEM method was found to be useful for elucidating the internal structure of small solid particles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665209>Knowledge and debate in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition: new sections, new science, and looking forward and outward.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666983>Protocol for a two-arm feasibility RCT to support postnatal maternal weight management and positive lifestyle behaviour in women from an ethnically diverse inner city population: the SWAN feasibility trial.</a></h2><p>A high BMI during and after pregnancy is linked to poor pregnancy outcomes and contributes to long-term maternal , hypertension, and diabetes.

However, one consequence of massive weight loss is excess skin and soft tissue. Many details regarding the timing, outcomes, and barriers associated with body contouring surgery (BCS) in youth who have undergone bariatric surgery are unknown.Describe the incidence and effect of BCS following bariatric surgery among adolescents.University Hospitals METHODS: Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery is a prospective multi-institutional study of 242 adolescents who underwent bariatric surgery from 2007 to 2012. Utilization of BCS was analyzed in this population with comparison of anthropometrics and excess skin-related symptoms between those who did and those who did not undergo BCS.Among the 198 study participants with BCS data available, 25 (12.6%) underwent 41 body contouring procedures after bariatric surgery. The most common BCS was panniculectomy (n = 23). Presence of pannus-related symptoms at baseline and the magnitude of weight loss within the first year after bariatric surgery were independently associated with subsequent panniculectomy (P = .04 and P = .03, respectively). All adolescents who underwent panniculectomy experienced resolution of pannus-related symptoms. At 5 years after bariatric surgery, 74% of those who did not undergo panniculectomy reported an interest in the procedure, and 58% indicated that cost/insurance coverage was the barrier to obtaining BCS.Few adolescents who underwent bariatric surgery later underwent BCS procedures. Panniculectomy effectively treated pannus-related symptoms. Disparities in access to surgical care for adolescents who desire BCS warrants further investigation.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Bariatric Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Patients <18 years of age, listed for lung transplant, or underweight were excluded. ECMO outcomes, including hospital length of stay and survival to discharge, were analyzed after stratification according to BMI. Multivariate logistic and linear regression techniques were used to assess variables associated with the outcomes of death and length of stay, respectively.One hundred ninety-four patients with a median BMI of 35.7 kg/m (33-42 kg/m) were included. Obese patients were older, had higher creatinine levels, and required higher levels of positive end-expiratory pressure and mean airway pressure at time of cannulation.

Mammary tumorigenesis is severely linked to , one potential connection is leptin. Leptin is a hormone secreted by adipocytes, which contributes to the progression of breast cancer. Cell migration, metalloproteases secretion, and invasion are cellular processes associated with various stages of metastasis. These processes are regulated by the kinases FAK and Src. In this study, we utilized the breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 to determine the effect of leptin on FAK and Src kinases activation, cell migration, metalloprotease secretion, and invasion. We found that leptin activates FAK and Src, and induces the localization of FAK to the focal adhesions. Interestingly, leptin promotes the activation of FAK through a Src and STAT3-dependent canonical pathway. Specific inhibitors of FAK, Src and STAT3 showed that the effect exerted by leptin in cell migration in breast cancer cells is dependent on these proteins. Moreover, we established that leptin promotes the secretion of the extracellular matrix remodelers, MMP-2 and MMP-9 and invasion in a FAK and Src dependent manner. Our findings strongly suggest that leptin promotes the development of a more aggressive invasive phenotype in mammary cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665455>GLP-1 Analog Modulates Appetite, Taste Preference, Gut Hormones and Regional Body Fat Stores in Adults with .</a></h2><p> is associated with alterations in appetite, gastrointestinal (GI) hormone levels and excessive fat mass. We previously published a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 16-week trial on effects of once daily GLP-1 analog, liraglutide on weight, satiation, and gastric functions in obese volunteers.

The regularity and intensity of exercise is modulated at the molecular level in the skeletal muscle by two protein kinases, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which act as sensors of external stimuli, showing the energy status of muscular fibers. The mTOR pathway is activated by insulin and amino acid availability, and its metabolic actions culminate in increased protein synthesis and reduced autophagy, leading to an increase in muscle mass. In contrast, AMPK activation induces a transcriptional program aimed to increase the mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, transforming fast-twitch glycolytic fibers to slow-twitch oxidative fibers and increasing resistance to fatigue. In addition, inadequate exercise training induces imbalance in the immune response, generating excessive inflammation and/or immunosuppression. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that provide insight into dietary protein interventions and/or amino acid supplementation that may improve outcomes after exercise by modulating 1) mTOR and AMPK activation during early exercise recovery, leading to increased muscle protein synthesis or increased oxidative capacity; 2) undesirable inflammatory responses; and 3) fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels that may have relevant implications in skeletal muscle metabolism, particularly during the exercise recovery and performance of obese subjects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Low socioeconomic status has been associated with a higher body mass index. However, the pathways underlying this complex relationship are poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate the possible mediation and/or moderation effects of complexity of knowledge about healthy eating, and self-regulation processes towards healthy eating, in the association between family's income and weight of elementary school age children. The results showed that complexity of knowledge does not mediate the relationship between socioeconomic status and weight. Still, whenever the levels of complexity of knowledge and self-regulation are high, there is a moderation effect of complexity of knowledge on the relationship between family's income and weight, conditioned by self-regulation scores. These promising findings support the idea that knowledge about healthy eating in isolation could be insufficient for practicing a healthy diet and underline the relevance of combining transmission of knowledge with training in specific competences (e.g., self-regulation strategies). Considering that complexity of knowledge about healthy eating and self-regulation strategies are interrelated and can be both improved, future preventive interventions could consider incorporating both in their design to mitigate childhood .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672329>From mitochondria to healthy aging: The role of branched-chain amino acids treatment: MATeR a randomized study.</a></h2><p>Malnutrition often affects elderly patients and significantly contributes to the reduction in healthy life expectancy, causing high morbidity and mortality. In particular, protein malnutrition is one of the determinants of frailty and sarcopenia in elderly people.To investigate the role of amino acid supplementation in senior patients we performed an open-label randomized trial and administered a particular branched-chain amino acid enriched mixture (BCAAem) or provided diet advice in 155 elderly malnourished patients. They were followed for 2 months, assessing cognitive performance by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), muscle mass measured by anthropometry, strength measure by hand grip and performance measured by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, the 30 s Chair Sit to Stand (30-s CST) test and the 4 m gait speed test. Moreover we measured oxidative stress in plasma and mitochondrial production of ATP and electron flux in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Both groups improved in nutritional status, general health and muscle mass, strength and performance; treatment with BCAAem supplementation was more effective than simple diet advice in increasing MMSE (1.2 increase versus 0.2, p = 0.0171), ATP production (0.43 increase versus -0.1, p = 0.0001), electron flux (0.50 increase versus 0.01, p < 0.0001) and in maintaining low oxidative stress. The amelioration of clinical parameters as MMSE, balance, four meter walking test were associated to increased mitochondrial function.Overall, our findings show that sustaining nutritional support might be clinically relevant in increasing physical performance in elderly malnourished patients and that the use of specific BCAAem might ameliorate also cognitive performance thanks to an amelioration of mitochondria bioenergetics.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

These compounds have been widely screened for their pharmacological effects. Polyphenols, such as soy-derived isoflavones, also called phytoestrogens, have been extensively studied due to their ability to inhibit carcinogenesis. These compounds are chemically similar to 17β-estradiol, and mimic the binding of estrogens to its receptors, exerting estrogenic effects in target organs. Genistein is an isoflavone derived from soy-rich products and accounts for about 60% of total isoflavones found in soybeans. Genistein has been reported to exhibit several biological effects, such as anti-tumor activity (inhibition of cell proliferation, regulation of the cell cycle, induction of apoptosis), improvement of glucose metabolism, impairment of angiogenesis in both hormone-related and hormone-unrelated cancer cells, reduction of peri-menopausal and postmenopausal hot flashes, and modulation of antioxidant effects. Additionally, epidemiological and clinical studies have reported health benefits of genistein in many chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis, and aid in the amelioration of typical menopausal symptoms, such as anxiety and depression. Although the biological effects are promising, certain limitations, such as low bioavailability, biological estrogenic activity, and effects on target organs, have limited the clinical applications of genistein to some extent. Moreover, studies report that modification of its molecular structure may eliminate the biological estrogenic activity and its effects on target organs. In this review, we summarize the potential benefits of genistein on menopause symptoms and menopause-related diseases like cardiovascular, osteoporosis, , diabetes, anxiety, depression, and breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670067>Synergistic action of Erigeron annuus L.

(BO) can suppress lipid accumulation in 3 T3-L1 adipocytes. Similarly, we recently revealed that Erigeron annuus L. Pers (EA) can significantly diminish both lipid accumulation and adipocyte differentiation in 3 T3-L1 cells through an AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase)-dependent mechanism. Accordingly, the objective of this present study was to evaluate the anti- activity of EA and/or BO using an animal model of .  was induced in C57BL/6 J mice by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD; 60 kcal% fat) for 3 weeks, followed by administration of EA and/or BO (100-200 mg/kg body weight) or positive control Garcinia Cambogia (GC) (100 mg/kg body weight) for an additional 8 weeks. The anti- effect of EA and/or BO was assessed by measuring body weight, adipocyte size, lipid accumulation, and expression level of genes associated with adipogenesis. We found the administration of EA and/or BO significantly attenuated increases in body weight gain, adipocyte size, and lipid accumulation in obese mice induced by HFD. In addition, western blot analysis revealed that HFD-mediated increases in expressions levels of adipogenic genes such as PPARγ, C/EBPα, and SREBP-1c were diminished by EA and/or BO. Moreover, EA and/or BO significantly stimulated the production of adiponectin, a unique adipokine known to stimulate the breakdown of fat/lipids, whereas adiponectin levels were reduced in mice fed a HFD. Notably, a combination of EA and BO was more effective at modulating such parameters than EA or BO alone. Taken together, these results demonstrate that an anti- effect of EA and/or BO can reduce adipocyte hypertrophy and modulate the expression of adipogenesis-associated genes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesized that MetS confers an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in severely injured trauma patients.We performed a retrospective review of trauma patients from 2014 through 2018, excluding patients <16 years of age, ISS <16, and with incomplete height and/or weight documentation. MetS was defined as the presence of diabetes, hypertension, and a BMI ≥30 kg/m. Outcomes included length of stay (LOS), complications, discharge location, and mortality.There were 4,491 patients meeting criteria of which 100 (2.2%) had MetS. Patients with MetS were older (64.0 vs 38.6 years, p<.0001) but similar in ISS (22 vs 22, p=.70). Hospital LOS was significantly longer with MetS (16.5 vs 11 days, p <.0001) as was ICU LOS (9 vs 5 days, p=.0002). MetS correlated with higher rates of AKI (19% vs 3.6%,p<.0001), ARDS (11.0% vs 4.6%, p=.01), cardiac arrest (10.0% vs 4.0%, p=.01), MI (2.0% vs 0.3%, p=.05), severe sepsis (8.0% vs 3.3%, p=.03), unplanned intubation (11.0% vs 5.0%, p=.02), unplanned ICU admission (13.0% vs 6.1%, p=.02), and non-home discharge (51.0% vs 30.2%, p=.0007). After controlling for age, GCS, ISS, gender, and mechanism, MetS remained an independent predictor of mortality (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.33-4.7, p=.004).MetS occurs infrequently in our severely injured trauma population but is strongly associated with increasing LOS as well as cardiac, pulmonary, infectious, and renal complications. MetS also significantly and independently predicts death and should be identified early to facilitate prompt multidisciplinary treatment.Copyright © 2019.

However, the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that an increase in dietary saturated fat could lead to abnormalities of calcium homeostasis and heart rhythm by a NOX2 (NADPH oxidase 2)-dependent mechanism.We investigated this hypothesis by feeding mice high-fat diets. In vivo heart rhythm telemetry, optical mapping, and isolated cardiac myocyte imaging were used to quantify arrhythmias, repolarization, calcium transients, and intracellular calcium sparks.We found that saturated fat activates NOX (NADPH oxidase), whereas polyunsaturated fat does not. The high saturated fat diet increased repolarization heterogeneity and ventricular tachycardia inducibility in perfused hearts. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of NOX2 prevented arrhythmogenic abnormalities in vivo during high statured fat diet and resulted in less inducible ventricular tachycardia. High saturated fat diet activates CaMK (Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase) in the heart, which contributes to abnormal calcium handling, promoting arrhythmia.We conclude that NOX2 deletion or pharmacological inhibition prevents the arrhythmogenic effects of a high saturated fat diet, in part mediated by activation of CaMK. This work reveals a molecular mechanism linking cardiac metabolism to arrhythmia and suggests that NOX2 inhibitors could be a novel therapy for heart rhythm abnormalities caused by cardiac lipid overload.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668562>Tobacco smoking and the risk of pancreatitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies.</a></h2><p>Tobacco smoking has been associated with increased risk of pancreatitis in several studies, however, not all studies have found an association and it is unclear whether there is a dose-response relationship between increasing amount of tobacco smoked and pancreatitis risk. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies on tobacco smoking and pancreatitis to clarify the association.PubMed and Embase databases were searched for relevant studies up to April 13th 2019. Prospective studies that reported adjusted relative risk (RR) estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between tobacco smoking and pancreatitis were included and summary RRs were calculated using a random effects model.Ten prospective studies were included. The summary RR for acute pancreatitis was 1.49 (95% CI: 1.29-1.72, I = 68%, n = 7) for current smokers, 1.24 (95% CI: 1.15-1.34, I = 0%, n = 7) for former smokers, and 1.39 (95% CI: 1.25-1.54, I = 69%, n = 7) for ever smokers compared to never smokers. Similar results were observed for chronic pancreatitis and acute/chronic pancreatitis combined. The summary RR per 10 cigarettes per day was 1.30 (95% CI: 1.18-1.42, I = 42%, n = 3) and per 10 pack-years in current smokers was 1.13 (95% CI: 1.08-1.17, I = 14%, n = 4) for acute pancreatitis and results were similar for chronic pancreatitis and acute/chronic pancreatitis combined.These results suggest that tobacco smoking increases the risk of acute and chronic pancreatitis and acute and chronic pancreatitis combined and that there is a dose-response relationship between increasing number of cigarettes and pack-years and pancreatitis risk.Copyright © 2019 IAP and EPC.

The inhibition of 11β-HSD1 has been shown to attenuate the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and other diseases mediated by excessive cortisol production. In this work, fifteen benzothiazole derivatives substituted with electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups were designed to explore their affinity for 11β-HSD1 using in silico methods. The results show that (E)-5-((benzo[d]thiazol-2-ylimino)(methylthio)methylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (C1) has good physicochemical properties and favorable interactions with 11β-HSD1 through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions in the catalytic site formed by Y183, S170 and Y177. Furthermore, C1 was synthesized and evaluated in vitro and ex vivo using clobenzorex (CLX) as a reference drug in obese Zucker rats. The in vitro results showed that C1 was a better inhibitor of human 11β-HSD1 than CLX. The ex vivo assay results demonstrated that C1 was capable of reducing 11β-HSD1 overexpression in mesenteric adipose tissue.

The two isoforms, LXRα (NR1H3) and LXRβ (NR1H2), are differentially expressed, with the former expressed predominantly in metabolically active tissues and the latter more ubiquitously. Both are activated by oxidised cholesterol metabolites, endogenously produced oxysterols. LXRs have important roles in lipid metabolism and inflammation, plus a number of newly emerging roles. They are implicated in regulating lipid balance in normal male reproductive function and may provide a link between male infertility and lipid disorders and/or . Studies from Lxr knockout mouse models provide compelling evidence to support this.

NO is synthesized from l-arginine through the action of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) family of enzymes, which includes three isoforms: endothelial NOS (eNOS), neuronal NOS (nNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS). iNOS-derived NO has been associated with the pathogenesis and progression of several diseases, including liver diseases, insulin resistance,  and diseases of the cardiovascular system. However, transient NO production can modulate metabolism to survive and cope with stress conditions. Accumulating evidence strongly imply that iNOS-derived NO plays a central role in the regulation of several biochemical pathways and energy metabolism including glucose and lipid metabolism during inflammatory conditions.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genec susceptibility loci for  and T2DM, although the causal genes and mechanisms are largely unknown. SPRY2 is a candidate gene identified in GWAS of body fat percentage and T2DM, and has recently been linked to insulin production in pancreatic β-cells. In the present study, we aimed to further understand SPRY2 via functional characterisation in HepG2 cells, an in vitro model of human hepatocytes widely used to investigate T2DM and insulin resistance.CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing was used to target SPRY2 in HepG2 cells, and the functional consequences of SPRY2 knockout (KO) and overexpression subsequently assessed using glucose uptake and lipid droplet assays, measurement of protein kinase phosphorylation and RNA sequencing.The major functional consequence of SPRY2 KO was a significant increase in glucose uptake, along with elevated lipid droplet accumulation. These changes were attenuated, but not reversed, in cells overexpressing SPRY2. Phosphorylation of protein kinases across key signalling pathways (including Akt and mitogen activated protein kinases) was not altered after SPRY2 KO. Transcriptome profiling in SPRY2 KO and mock (control) cells revealed a number of differentially expressed genes related to cholesterol biosynthesis, cell cycle regulation and cellular signalling pathways. Phospholipase A2 group IIA (PLA2G2A) mRNA level was subsequently validated as significantly upregulated following SPRY2 KO, highlighting this as a potential mediator downstream of SPRY2.These findings suggest a role for SPRY2 in glucose and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes and contribute to clarifying the function of this gene in the context of metabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667091>A novel method for measuring diet-induced thermogenesis in mice.</a></h2><p>Diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) refers to energy expenditure (EE) related to food consumption.

Indeed, mutations in the human TBX3 lead to ulnar mammary syndrome which is characterized by several clinical malformations including hypoplasia of the mammary and apocrine glands, defects of the upper limb, areola, dental structures, heart and genitalia. In contrast, TBX3 has no known function in adult tissues but is frequently overexpressed in a wide range of epithelial and mesenchymal derived cancers. This overexpression greatly impacts several hallmarks of cancer including bypass of senescence, apoptosis and anoikis, promotion of proliferation, tumour formation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastatic capabilities as well as cancer stem cell expansion. The debilitating consequences of having too little or too much TBX3 suggest that its expression levels need to be tightly regulated. While we have a reasonable understanding of the mutations that result in low levels of functional TBX3 during development, very little is known about the factors responsible for the overexpression of TBX3 in cancer. Furthermore, given the plethora of oncogenic activities that TBX3 impact, it must be regulating several target genes but to date only a few have been identified and characterised. Interestingly, while there is compelling evidence to support oncogenic roles for TBX3, a few studies have indicated that it may also have tumour suppressor functions in certain contexts. Together, the diverse functional elasticity of TBX3 in development and cancer is thought to involve, in part, the protein partners that it interacts with and this area of research has recently received some attention. This review provides an insight into the significance of TBX3 in development and cancer and identifies research gaps that need to be explored to shed more light on this transcription factor.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

A solution to this catch-up dilemma is breast feeding for a minimum of 6 to 12 mo. Because the overall prevalence of metabolic risk factors is very low, routine evaluation of metabolic parameters is not recommended for all children born SGA, but it may be useful to consider metabolic evaluations in overweight or obese children born SGA.

All three components can be measured generically by the basic systolic and diastolic dimension measures of LV wall length, wall thickness and diameter. In this observational study we aimed to study the relations of normal generic strains to age, body size and gender, as well as the interrelations between the three strain components.Generic strains derived from dimension measures by longitudinal and cross-sectional M-mode in all three dimensions were measured in 1266 individuals without heart disease from the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study.The mean ε was -16.3%, ε was -22.7% and ε was 56.5%. Normal values by age and gender are provided. There was a gradient of ε from the endocardial, via the midwall to the external level, lowest at the external. All strains decreased in absolute values by increasing body surface area (BSA) and age, relations were strongest for ε. Gender differences were mainly a function of BSA differences. The three strain components were strongly interrelated through myocardial incompressibility.Global systolic strain is the total deformation of the myocardium; the three strain components are the spatial coordinates of this deformation, irrespective of the technology used for measurement. Normal values are method-dependent and not normative across methods. Interrelation of strains indicates a high degree of myocardial incompressibility and that longitudinal strain carries most of the total information.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Exclusion criteria included type I diabetes and previous pancreas transplantation. NODAT was defined as a new insulin requirement after KT. Delayed graft function was defined as need for dialysis within the first week after KT. Mean posttransplant follow-up period was 22 months.Forty-one patients underwent KT after LSG after median time of 16 months. Median age of postLSG patients undergoing KT was 56.0 years at time of KT. Average body mass index decreased by 9 from the time of LSG to KT, and no patients regained weight at 1-year follow-up. After LSG, the number of patients with hypertension (85.4% versus 48.5%) and the number of antihypertensive medications used decreased significantly (1.6 versus .6) at time of KT (P < .001 each). At 1-year follow-up, the improvement in hypertension persisted (51.2% versus 48.5%, P = nonsignificant). The average insulin regimen decreased from 33.0 ± 51.6 to 11.7 ± 21.5 units at KT (P < .001). This improvement also persisted at 1-year follow-up (11.9 versus 11.7 units, P = nonsignificant). Zero patients suffered NODAT over the follow-up period (versus institutional rate of NODAT at 15.8%). One patient developed delayed graft function (2.4%, versus institutional rate of 13.3%).

Exogenous administration of both taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs have also been implicated in the modulation of cardiovascular functions. This brief review summarizes the role of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs in vascular relaxation through the modulation of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO). The effects of taurine on vascular health are controversial. However, in the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors, it has been proposed that taurine can increase vascular NO levels by increasing eNOS expression, eNOS phosphorylation on Ser1177, NO bioavailability, the level of antioxidative defense, and the l-arginine/NOS inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) ratio. The taurine-conjugated BA-mediated activation of Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), G protein-coupled BA receptor (TGR5) and/or muscarinic 3 receptor (M3) was also reported to increase vascular NO production. FXR activation increases eNOS expression and may reduce ADMA formation, while TGR5 increases mobilization of Ca and phosphorylation of eNOS and AKT in endothelial cells. Furthermore, taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs might regulate NO synthesis and activity by enhancing HS generation. Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of both taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs in reversing the endothelial dysfunction associated with diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension, , malnutrition, and smoking. In addition, taurine-conjugated BAs have emerged as a potential treatment for portal hypertension. Despite these favorable findings, there is a need to further explore the mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying the endothelial effects of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs. Here, we summarize the main findings regarding the effects of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs on the endothelial dysfunction associated with altered NO metabolism in cardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2019.

However, autophagy is also a part of normal cellular physiology that facilitates the turnover of cellular constituents under normal conditions: it can be readily augmented by mild environmental stress; but becomes dysfunctional with severe oxidative stress leading to cellular pathology. The molluscan hepatopancreas or digestive gland provides a versatile and environmentally relevant model to investigate lysosomal autophagy and stress-induced dysfunctional autophagy. This latter process has been implicated in many animal and human disease conditions, including degenerative and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as  related conditions. Many environmental pollutants have also been found to induce dysfunctional autophagy in molluscan hepatopancreatic digestive cells, and in this study, the marine blue mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis was exposed for 7 days to: 0.1 μM, 1 μM and 10 μM concentrations of fluoranthene and phenanthrene (PAHs); chlorpyrifos and malathion (organophosphorus compounds); atrazine (triazine herbicide); copper (transition metal) and dodecylbenzene sulphonic acid (LAS, surfactant). The marine snail or periwinkle, Littorina littorea, was also exposed to phenanthrene, chlorpyrifos and copper. Indices of oxidative stress, cell injury and dysfunctional autophagy were measured (i.e., lysosomal membrane stability, protein carbonyls, lipofuscin, and lysosomal accumulation of lipid or lipidosis). Evidence of oxidative stress, based on the elevation of lipofuscin and protein carbonyls, was found for all compounds tested; with chlorpyrifos being the most toxic to both species. Dysfunctional autophagy was induced by all of the compounds tested in both species, except for atrazine in mussels. This failure of normal autophagy was consistently associated with oxidative stress. Autophagic dysfunction is an important emerging feature in the aetiology of many disease conditions in animals and humans; and an explanatory conceptual mechanistic model has been developed for dysregulation of autophagy in response to oxidative stress.Copyright © 2019.

Factors affecting the access to the waiting list and the transplantability of this specific population will be analyzed. From observational studies, kidney transplantation in obese patients carries an increased risk of surgical complications compared to the non-obese population; therefore many centers have been reluctant to proceed with transplantation, despite this treatment modality confers a survival advantage over dialysis. As a consequence, obese patients continue to face decreased access to the waiting list, with a lower likelihood of being transplanted and higher waiting times when compared to the non-obese candidates. In this review will be described the current strategies for treatment of  in different settings (pre-transplant, at transplant and post-transplant) represents a risk factor for surgical complications but not a contraindication for kidney transplantation; outcomes could be greatly improved with its multidisciplinary and multimodal treatment.

Chronic stress and depression are highly associated with symptoms of the metabolic syndrome, but the molecular link is still not fully understood. Furthermore, therapies tackling these biological disorders are still lacking. The identification of shared molecular targets underlying both pathophysiologies may lead to the development of new treatments. The FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP51) has recently been identified as a promising therapeutic target for stress-related psychiatric disorders and -related metabolic outcomes.The aim of this review is to summarize current evidence of in vitro, preclinical, and human studies on the stress responsive protein FKBP51, focusing on its newly discovered role in metabolism. Also, we highlight the therapeutic potential of FKBP51 as a new treatment target for symptoms of the metabolic syndrome.We conclude the review by emphasizing missing knowledge gaps that remain and future research opportunities needed to implement FKBP51 as a drug target for stress-related  or T2D.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this study, it was aimed to select the best incision management system to keep the incision edges together and prevent wound opening, and infection by protecting the incision. In this study, 60 patients who underwent abdominal surgery were evaluated regarding their risk of wound dehiscence. In our clinic, high-risk cases of abdominal surgery are performed, the risk factors being ischemia along the incision line, dirty and contaminated wound, , tension on the suture line, traumatization of the wound site, age at onset (> 65), body mass index (BMI) > 30, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), immunosuppressive drug users. A prospective study protocol was planned after ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) physical status class assignment. Patients were divided into three groups: patients who underwent a postoperative negative-pressure therapy dressing, patients who underwent subcutaneous aspiration drainage, and patients who received standard dressing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the decompensation, surgical site infection, seroma, hospital stay and costs and to evaluate the results in the postoperative period. Sixty patients were randomized (n = 20, for each group). Thirty-one (51%) of the patients were male, and the mean age was 64.3 ± 8.9 (46-85). The mean BMI was 30.45 ± 7.2. There was no statistically significant difference (p≥0.05) between groups in terms of sex, age, and BMI. The ASA score and surgical interventions were similar between the groups. Wound dehiscence rate was 25% (n = 8), 20% (n = 6) and 3% (n = 1) for the Standard Dressing (SD), Aspiration Drainage (AD) and Negative-Pressure (NP) groups, respectively (p <0.017). Duration of hospitalization was 16.45 ± 6.6, 14.3 ± 7.4 and 8.95 ± 2.8 days (p <0.001) for SD, AD and NP groups, respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between the groups regarding other variables (p≥0.05 for all variables). Negative-pressure wound treatment is an easy, fast and practical technique which reduces lateral tension and swelling. It provides perfusion support and helps to protect the surgical field against external sources of infection.©Carol Davila University Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671431>Outcomes of Patients with Central Precocious Puberty due to Loss-of-Function Mutations in MKRN3 Gene After Treatment with Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Analog.</a></h2><p>Loss-of-function mutation of MKRN3 represents the most frequent genetic cause of familial central precocious puberty (CPP). The outcomes of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) treatment in CPP patients with MKRN3 defects are unknown.To describe the clinical and hormonal features of patients with CPP with or without MKRN3 mutations after GnRHa treatment. Anthropometric, metabolic and reproductive parameters were evaluated.Twenty-nine female patients with CPP due to loss-of-function mutations in the MKRN3 and 43 female patients with idiopathic CPP were included. Their medical records were retrospectively evaluated for clinical, laboratory, and imaging study, before, during, and after GnRHa treatment. All patients with idiopathic CPP and 11 patients with CPP due to MKRN3 defects reached final height (FH).At the diagnosis, there were no significant differences between clinical and laboratory features of patients with CPP with or without MKRN3 mutations. A high prevalence of overweight and  was observed in patients with CPP with or without MKRN3 mutations (47.3% and 50%, respectively), followed by a significant reduction after GnRHa treatment. No significant differences in the values of mean FH and target height were found between the two CPP groups after GnRHa treatment. Menarche occurred at the expected age in patients with or without CPP due to MKRN3 mutations (11.5 ± 1.3 yr and 12 ± 0.6 yr, respectively). The prevalence of polycystic ovarian syndrome was 9.1% in patients with CPP due to MKRN3 mutations and 5.9% in those with idiopathic CPP.Anthropometric, metabolic and reproductive outcomes after GnRHa treatment were comparable in CPP patients, with or without MKRN3 mutations, suggesting the absence of deleterious effects of MKRN3 defects in young female adults' life.© 2019 S.

PROK2 is also expressed in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) as an essential factor for neuro-and morphogenesis. Since the MOB was shown to be strongly involved in eating behavior, we hypothesized that PROK2 could be a new target in the regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis, through its effects in the MOB. We also asked whether PROK2 could be associated with the pathophysiology of , the metabolic syndrome (MetS), and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in humans.We assessed in wild type mice whether the expression of Prok2 in the MOB is dependent on the nutritional status. We measured the effect of human recombinant PROK2 (rPROK2) acute injection in the MOB on food intake and olfactory behavior. Then, using a lentivirus expressing Prok2-shRNA, we studied the effects of Prok2 underexpression in the MOB on feeding behavior and glucose metabolism. Metabolic parameters and meal pattern were determined using calorimetric cages. In vivo 2-deoxyglucose uptake measurements were performed in mice after intraperitoneally insulin injection. Plasmatic PROK2 dosages and genetic associations studies were carried out respectively on 148 and more than 4000 participants from the D.E.S.I.R. (Data from an Epidemiologic Study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome) cohort.Our findings showed that fasting in mice reduced Prok2 expression in the MOB. Acute injection of rPROK2 in the MOB significantly decreased food intake whereas Prok2-shRNA injection resulted in a higher dietary consumption characterized by increased feeding frequency and decreased meal size. Additionally, Prok2 underexpression in the MOB induced insulin resistance compared to scrambled shRNA-injected mice. In the human D.E.S.I.R. cohort, we found a significantly lower mean concentration of plasma PROK2 in people with T2D than in those with normoglycemia. Interestingly, this decrease was no longer significant when adjusted for Body Mass Index (BMI) or calorie intake, suggesting that the association between plasma PROK2 and diabetes is mediated, at least partly, by BMI and feeding behavior in humans. Moreover, common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in PROK2 gene were genotyped and associated with incident T2D or impaired fasting glycemia (IFG), MetS, and .Our data highlight PROK2 as a new target in the MOB that links olfaction with eating behavior and energy homeostasis.

School-based interventions hold great promise to combat the rising trend of childhood . This systematic review aimed to assess the overall effects of school-based  prevention interventions, and to investigate characteristics of intervention components that are potentially effective for preventing childhood .We systematically searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL and Embase databases to identify randomized- or cluster randomized- controlled trials of school-based  interventions published between 1990 and 2019. We conducted meta-analyses and subgroup analyses to determine the overall effects of  prevention programs and effect differences by various characteristics of intervention components on body mass index (BMI) or BMI Z-score of children.This systematic review included a total of 50 trials (reported by 56 publications). Significant differences were found between groups on BMI (- 0.14 kg/m (95% confidence interval: - 0.21, - 0.06)) and BMI Z-score (- 0.05 (- 0.10, - 0.01)) for single-component interventions; significant differences were also found between groups on BMI (- 0.32 (- 0.54, - 0.09) kg/m) and BMI Z-score (- 0.07 (- 0.14, - 0.001)) for multi-component interventions. Subgroup analyses consistently demonstrated that effects of single-component (physical activity) interventions including curricular sessions (- 0.30 (- 0.51, - 0.10) kg/m in BMI) were stronger than those without curricular sessions (- 0.04 (- 0.17, 0.09) kg/m in BMI); effects of single-component (physical activity) interventions were also strengthened if physical activity sessions emphasized participants' enjoyment (- 0.19 (- 0.33, - 0.05) kg/m in BMI for those emphasizing participants' enjoyment; - 0.004 (- 0.10, 0.09) kg/m in BMI for those not emphasizing participants' enjoyment). The current body of evidence did not find specific characteristics of intervention components that were consistently associated with improved efficacy for multi-component interventions (P > 0.05).School-based interventions are generally effective in reducing excessive weight gain of children. Our findings contribute to increased understandings of potentially effective intervention characteristics for single-component (physical activity) interventions.

However, the availability of public social media data has led to new ethical challenges about respecting user privacy and the appropriateness of monitoring social media for clinical trial recruitment. Researchers have voiced the need for involving users' perspectives in the development of ethical norms and regulations.This study examined the attitudes and level of concern among Twitter users and nonusers about using Twitter for monitoring social media users and their conversations to recruit potential clinical trial participants.We used two online methods for recruiting study participants: the open survey was (1) advertised on Twitter between May 23 and June 8, 2017, and (2) deployed on TurkPrime, a crowdsourcing data acquisition platform, between May 23 and June 8, 2017. Eligible participants were adults, 18 years of age or older, who lived in the United States. People with and without Twitter accounts were included in the study.While nearly half the respondents-on Twitter (94/603, 15.6%) and on TurkPrime (509/603, 84.4%)-indicated agreement that social media monitoring constitutes a form of eavesdropping that invades their privacy, over one-third disagreed and nearly 1 in 5 had no opinion. A chi-square test revealed a positive relationship between respondents' general privacy concern and their average concern about Internet research (P<.005). We found associations between respondents' Twitter literacy and their concerns about the ability for researchers to monitor their Twitter activity for clinical trial recruitment (P=.001) and whether they consider Twitter monitoring for clinical trial recruitment as eavesdropping (P<.001) and an invasion of privacy (P=.003). As Twitter literacy increased, so did people's concerns about researchers monitoring Twitter activity. Our data support the previously suggested use of the nonexceptionalist methodology for assessing social media in research, insofar as social media-based recruitment does not need to be considered exceptional and, for most, it is considered preferable to traditional in-person interventions at physical clinics. The expressed attitudes were highly contextual, depending on factors such as the type of disease or health topic (eg, HIV/AIDS vs  vs smoking), the entity or person monitoring users on Twitter, and the monitored information.The data and findings from this study contribute to the critical dialogue with the public about the use of social media in clinical research. The findings suggest that most users do not think that monitoring Twitter for clinical trial recruitment constitutes inappropriate surveillance or a violation of privacy. However, researchers should remain mindful that some participants might find social media monitoring problematic when connected with certain conditions or health topics. Further research should isolate factors that influence the level of concern among social media users across platforms and populations and inform the development of more clear and consistent guidelines.©Katja Reuter, Yifan Zhu, Praveen Angyan, NamQuyen Le, Akil A Merchant, Michael Zimmer.

Macrophages, which express high levels of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), are important phagocytes in the innate immune system. Our previous studies indicated that environmentally relevant concentrations of arsenite (As) could inhibit the major immune functions of macrophages. As the down-regulation of LPL is known to increase the expression of ABCA1, the cholesterol exporter demonstrated to be related to the resistance of arsenic toxicity. We examined if orlistat could reverse the inhibitive effects of As on macrophage functions. The results showed that 50 μM orlistat reversed As-induced suppressions on phagocytosis, NO production and cytokine secretion in THP-1 derived macrophages. The expression of ABCA1 was significantly increased by orlistat in As co-treated macrophages, which was associated with decreased intracellular As levels. Collectively, these results indicated that orlistat could reverse the suppressive effects induced by As in macrophages through the increased expression of ABCA1, which has the potential to be developed as a therapeutic agent for arsenic-induced immunosuppression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664582> paradox in subarachnoid hemorrhage: a systematic review.</a></h2><p>As the number of obese people is globally increasing, reports about the putative protective effect of  in life-threatening diseases, such as subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), are gaining more interest.

Thus, we performed a systematic review to clarify the relation of  and SAH mortality. Our study protocol included systematic literature search in PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane library databases, whereas risk-of-bias estimation and quality of each selected study were evaluated by the Critical Appraisal Skills Program and Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. A directional power analysis was performed to estimate sufficient sample size for significant results. From 176 reviewed studies, six fulfilled our eligibility criteria for qualitative analysis. One study found paradoxical effect (odds ratio, OR = 0.83 (0.74-0.92)) between morbid  (body mass index (BMI) > 40) and in-hospital SAH mortality, and another study found the effect between continuously increasing BMI and both short-term (OR = 0.90 (0.82-0.99)) and long-term SAH mortalities (OR = 0.92 (0.85-0.98)). However, according to our quality assessment, methodological shortcomings expose all reviewed studies to a high-risk-of-bias. Even though two studies suggest that  may protect SAH patients from death in the acute phase, all reviewed studies suffered from methodological shortcomings that have been typical in the research field of  paradox.

We focus on six dimensions of the FEP: food retail, provision, labelling, marketing, price and composition.Systematic literature review. Three databases (Web of Science, SciELO, LILACS) were searched, from 1 January 1999 up to July 2017. Two authors independently selected the studies. A narrative synthesis was used to summarize, integrate and interpret findings.Studies conducted in LA countries.The search yielded 2695 articles of which eighty-four met inclusion criteria.Most studies were descriptive and came from Brazil (61 %), followed by Mexico (18 %) and Guatemala (6 %). Studies were focused primarily on retail/provision (n 27), marketing (n 16) and labelling (n 15). Consistent associations between availability of fruit and vegetable markets and higher consumption of fruits and vegetables were found in cross-sectional studies. Health claims in food packaging were prevalent and mostly misleading. There was widespread use of marketing strategies for unhealthy foods aimed at children. Food prices were lower for processed relative to fresh foods. Some studies documented high sodium in industrially processed foods.Gaps in knowledge remain regarding policy evaluations, longitudinal food retail studies, impacts of food price on diet and effects of digital marketing on diet/health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673559>Sarcopenic  in liver cancer: it is SO complicated.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670905>Methylphenidate in children with monogenic  due to LEPR or MC4R deficiency improves feeling of satiety and reduces BMI-SDS-A case series.</a></h2><p>The clinical phenotype of patients with monogenic  due to mutations in the leptin receptor (LEPR) or melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) gene is characterized by impaired satiety and hyperphagia, leading to extreme, sometimes life-threatening weight gain.In a case series, we analysed the effect of an off-label methylphenidate (MPH) use for 1 year as an individual treatment approach on eating behaviour (Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire [CEBQ]), appetite (visual analogue scales) and body mass index (BMI) trajectories in five patients with severe  due to mutations in the LEPR (n = 3) or MC4R (n = 2) gene.After 1 year use of MPH (20 mg/day divided in two to three doses), BMI (Δ BMI  : -0.7 ± 0.9 kg/m ), BMI standard deviation score (SDS) (Δ BMI-SDS  : -0.32 ± 0.20), and %BMIP95 (Δ %BMIP95  : -6.6 ± 7.8%) decreased. BMI-SDS velocity decreased from +0.17 ± 0.22 to -0.30 ± 0.20. Appetite and CEBQ subscale scores for "food responsiveness" and "enjoyment of food" decreased. We observed adverse effects with increase in self-reported frequency of disordered sleep, nervousness, hyperactivity, and tics.The observed decrease in BMI trajectories with MPH use for one year is clinically meaningful in this group of patients, since the natural course would have been associated with a pronounced increase in BMI, leading to comorbidities and complications over time.© 2019 The Authors.

We applied an fMRI food-cue reactivity paradigm during which the participants were passively exposed to food pictures to evaluate neuronal activity in the DLPFC. Additionally, we measured concentrations of circulating GLP-1 levels during a standard oral glucose tolerance test. Phenotyping was performed consecutively before and after a 3-month low-calorie diet as well as after a randomized 12-month trial, investigating the effect of a combined behavioral intervention on body weight maintenance. Participants were then followed-up for another 12 months without further intervention.Using voxel-wise linear mixed-effects regression analyses, we evaluated 56 measurements and identified a strong interaction between circulating, endogenous GLP-1 levels and DLPFC activity predicting body weight change over the total observation period (t = -6.17, p = 1.6 · 10). While neither the GLP-1 nor the DLPFC response individually predicted the subsequent weight change, participants achieved body weight loss when the GLP-1 and the DLPFC responses occurred concurrently.Our data demonstrate an interaction between a peripheral hormonal signal and central nervous activity as robust predictor of body weight change throughout the different periods of a long-term life-style intervention. The preeminent role of their interdependency compared to the partly ambivalent effects of the single components argues for integrative approaches to improve sensitivity and reliability of weight prediction conventionally based on individual biomarkers.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Potential predictors were selected based on prior research and ease of evaluation.From the original database of 100 758 records, 86 362 women were included in the final cohort. The mean GDM prevalence was 7.6% (95%CI [confidence interval] 7.5%-7.8%), increasing from 4.4% (95% CI 4.0%-4.9%) in 2002 to 13.0% (95% CI 12.0%-13.9%) in 2015. Age, education, marital status, parity, family history of type 2 diabetes, personal history of GDM, hypertension and pre-eclampsia, alcohol consumption, smoking, and pre-gestational nutritional status performed well in the prediction of GDM.One out of eight Chilean pregnant women of medium- to low socio-economic status were found to develop GDM. We identified a set of easy-to-capture predictors in the primary health care system that may allow for the early identification of women at high risk for the development of GDM.© 2019 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665258>Differential Epigenetic Factors in the Prediction of Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetic Patients.</a></h2><p>Hyperglycemia can strongly alter the epigenetic signatures in many types of human vascular cells providing persistent perturbations of protein-protein interactions both in micro- and macro domains. The establishment of these epigenetic changes may precede cardiovascular (CV) complications and help us to predict vascular lesions in diabetic patients. Importantly, these epigenetic marks may be transmitted across several generations (transgenerational effect) and increase the individual risk of disease. Aberrant DNA methylation and imbalance of histone modifications, mainly acetylation and methylation of H3, represent key determinants of vascular lesions and, thus, putative useful biomarkers for prevention and diagnosis of CV risk in diabetics. Moreover, a differential expression of some micro-RNAs (miRNAs), mainly miR-126, may be a useful prognostic biomarker for atherosclerosis development in asymptomatic subjects. Recently, also environmental-induced chemical perturbations in mRNA (epitranscriptome), mainly the N6-methyladenosine, have been associated with  and diabetes. Importantly, reversal of epigenetic changes by modulation of lifestyle and use of metformin, statins, fenofibrate and apabetalone may offer useful therapeutic options to prevent or delay CV events in diabetics increasing the opportunity for personalized therapy. Network medicine is a promising molecular-bioinformatic approach to identify the signaling pathways underlying the pathogenesis of CV lesions in diabetic patients. Moreover, machine learning tools combined with tomography are advancing the individualized assessment of CV risk in these patients. We remark the need of combining epigenetics and advanced bioinformatic platforms to improve the prediction of vascular lesions in diabetics increasing the opportunity for CV precision medicine.© The Author(s) 2019.

Gastrointestinal hormones are involved in energy and glucose homeostasis, thus postoperative changes of their circulating levels may be mediating future weight loss. To investigate how the circulating concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones change in response to the most common types of bariatric operation and whether these changes can predict future weight loss.We measured circulating GLP-1, GLP-2, oxyntomodulin, glicentin, glucagon, major proglucagon fragment (MPGF), ghrelin, GIP, PYY after overnight fasting and/or after a mixed meal test (MMT) in: a) 14 subjects that have undergone either an adjustable gastric banding [AGB] (n = 9) or a Roux-en-Y bypass (RYGB) (n = 5) (Pilot study 1), b) 28 subjects that have undergone either a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (n = 17) or a RYGB (n = 11) before and three, six and twelve months after surgery.In addition to the expected associations with GLP-1, the most robust increases were observed in postprandial levels of oxyntomodulin and glicentin three months after VSG or RYGB (but not after AGB) and are associated with degree of weight loss. Oxyntomodulin and glicentin levels at the third and sixth month postoperative visit are positively associated with feeling of satiety which may be underlying the observed associations with future weight loss.Beyond GLP-1, early postprandial changes in circulating oxyntomodulin and glicentin are predictors of weight loss after bariatric surgery, possibly through regulation of satiety. Further studies should focus on underlying mechanisms, and their potential as attractive therapeutic tools against  and related comorbidities.Copyright © 2019.

A systematic strategy was used to search the health science, social science and marketing databases to identify peer-reviewed literature on food and non-alcoholic beverage company sponsorship of sport published in English from 2015 to 2019.Sixteen discrete studies were identified: six content analyses, two qualitative studies, four cross-sectional surveys and four experimental studies. Findings indicate sports sponsorship is widely used to promote unhealthy foods through professional and community sport, prompting increased awareness and preference for sponsor products. Most studies assessed self-reported responses to sponsorship, with a lack of behavioural data on food purchasing and consumption. Sports sponsorship by unhealthy food brands achieves vast population reach and exposure, promoting increased brand awareness and preference for sponsor products. Research is needed to improve our understanding of the relationship between food and beverage sponsorship and energy intake. Research evaluating the efficacy of strategies to reduce spectator's exposure to unhealthy sports sponsorship is also needed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672447>The Rho GTPase RND3 regulates adipocyte lipolysis.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue plays a crucial role in diet- and -related insulin resistance, with implications for several metabolic diseases. Identification of novel target genes and mechanisms that regulate adipocyte function could lead to improved treatment strategies. RND3 (RhoE/Rho8), a Rho-related GTP-binding protein that inhibits Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling, has been linked to diverse diseases such as apoptotic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cancer and type 2 diabetes, in part by regulating cytoskeleton dynamics and insulin-mediated glucose uptake.We here investigated the expression of RND3 in adipose tissue in human , and discovered a role for RND3 in regulating adipocyte metabolism. In cross-sectional and prospective studies, we observed 5-fold increased adipocyte levels of RND3 mRNA in , reduced levels after surgery-induced weight loss, and positive correlations of RND3 mRNA with adipocyte size and surrogate measures of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR and circulating triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TAG/HDL-C) ratio). By screening for RND3-dependent gene expression following siRNA-mediated RND3 knockdown in differentiating human adipocytes, we found downregulation of inflammatory genes and upregulation of genes related to adipocyte lipolysis and insulin signaling. Treatment of adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hypoxia or cAMP analogs increased RND3 mRNA levels 1.5-2-fold. Functional assays in primary human adipocytes confirmed that RND3 knockdown reduces cAMP- and isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, which were mimicked by treating cells with ROCK inhibitor. This effect could partly be explained by reduced protein expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).We here uncovered a novel differential expression of adipose RND3 in  and insulin resistance, which may at least partly depend on a causal effect of RND3 on adipocyte lipolysis.Copyright © 2019.

The primary end point was set as the change of fatty liver index (FLI) as a surrogate parameter of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Six-hundred and ninety-seven subjects (38 with T2DM) were enrolled. A baseline FLI ≥ 60 (the threshold for fatty liver) was found in 264 subjects (37.9%). The mean duration of fasting was 8.5 ± 4.0 days (range 6-38). FLI decreased significantly (-14.02 ± 11.67;  < 0.0001), with a larger effect in individuals with T2DM (-19.15 ± 11.0;  < 0.0001;  = 0.002 compared to non-diabetic subjects). Body mass index (BMI) decreased by -1.51 ± 0.82 kg/m, and 49.9% of the subjects lost ≥5% body weight. After fasting, nearly half of the 264 subjects with FLI ≥ 60 (highest risk category) shifted to a lower category. The improvement of FLI correlated with the number of fasting days (r = -0.20,  < 0.0001) and with the magnitude of BMI reduction (r = 0.14,  = 0.0001). Periodic fasting with concomitant weight reduction leads to significant rapid improvement of FLI in subjects with and without T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664147>Leucine-rich diet induces a shift in tumour metabolism from glycolytic towards oxidative phosphorylation, reducing glucose consumption and metastasis in Walker-256 tumour-bearing rats.</a></h2><p>Leucine can stimulate protein synthesis in skeletal muscle, and recent studies have shown an increase in leucine-related mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation capacity in muscle cells. However, leucine-related effects in tumour tissues are still poorly understood. Thus, we described the effects of leucine in both in vivo and in vitro models of a Walker-256 tumour. Tumour-bearing Wistar rats were randomly distributed into a control group (W; normoprotein diet) and leucine group (LW; leucine-rich diet [normoprotein + 3% leucine]). After 20 days of tumour evolution, the animals underwent -fludeoxyglucose positron emission computed tomography (F-FDG PET-CT) imaging, and after euthanasia, fresh tumour biopsy samples were taken for oxygen consumption rate measurements (Oroboros Oxygraph), electron microscopy analysis and RNA and protein extraction. Our main results from the LW group showed no tumour size change, lower tumour glucose (F-FDG) uptake, and reduced metastatic sites. Furthermore, leucine stimulated a shift in tumour metabolism from glycolytic towards oxidative phosphorylation, higher mRNA and protein expression of oxidative phosphorylation components, and enhanced mitochondrial density/area even though the leucine-treated tumour had a higher number of apoptotic nuclei with increased oxidative stress. In summary, a leucine-rich diet directed Walker-256 tumour metabolism to a less glycolytic phenotype profile in which these metabolic alterations were associated with a decrease in tumour aggressiveness and reduction in the number of metastatic sites in rats fed a diet supplemented with this branched-chain amino acid.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663614>Association between Health Insurance and Health among Adults with Diabetes: Evidence from Medicare.</a></h2><p>Gaining Medicare eligibility at age 65 is associated with increased health insurance coverage and reduced medical expenditure risk, but few studies have examined changes in health outcomes among adults with a specific chronic condition.

Secondary outcomes included health insurance coverage, healthcare spending burden, and functional limitations by cause and type.Medicare eligibility was associated with about an 8.0 percentage point reduction in the uninsured rate (95% confidence interval [CI], -9.9 to -6.0 percentage points; P < .001) and declines in high out-of-pocket healthcare expenditures and worry about medical bills. Eligibility was also associated with reductions of about 5.2 [95% CI, -6.9 to -3.6; P < .001] and 4.7 [95% CI, -7.1 to -2.3; P = .001] percentage points in fair or poor health and any functional limitation, respectively. Declines in functional limitations appeared to be driven by reductions in limitations due to diabetes, arthritis, heart problems, and emotional or behavioral problems.

FH is caused by mutations in genes that regulate LDL catabolism, mainly the LDL receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (APOB) and gain of function of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9). However, the phenotype may be encountered in individuals not carrying the latter monogenic defects, in approximately 20% of these effects of polygenes predominate, and in many individuals no molecular defects are encountered at all. These so-called FH phenocopy individuals have an elevated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in comparison with normolipidemic individuals but this risk is lower than in those with monogenic disease. Individuals with FH are exposed to elevated LDL-C levels since birth and this explains the high cardiovascular, mainly coronary heart disease, burden of these subjects. However, recent studies show that this risk is heterogenous and depends not only on high LDL-C levels but also on presence of previous cardiovascular disease, a monogenic cause, male sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, low HDL-cholesterol,  and elevated lipoprotein(a). This heterogeneity in risk can be captured by risk equations like one from the SAFEHEART cohort and by detection of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. High dose high potency statins are the main stain for LDL-C lowering in FH, however, in most situations these medications are not powered enough to reduce cholesterol to adequate levels. Ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors should also be used in order to better treat LDL-C in FH patients.Copyright © 2019.

Of those, 2498 veterans who underwent bariatric surgery were allocated to the surgery cohort. Sequential stratification was used to match each patient in the surgery cohort with up to 3 patients who had not undergone bariatric surgery but were of the same sex, race/ethnicity, diabetes status, and VA regional network and were closest in age, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and comorbidities. A total of 7456 patients were identified and allocated to the nonsurgery (control) cohort. The VA health care expenditures among the surgery and nonsurgery cohorts were estimated using regression models. Data were analyzed from July to August 2018 and in April 2019.The bariatric surgical procedures (n = 2498) included in this study were Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (1842 [73.7%]), sleeve gastrectomy (381 [15.3%]), adjustable gastric banding (249 [10.0%]), and other procedures (26 [1.0%]).The study measured total, outpatient, inpatient, and outpatient pharmacy expenditures from 3 years before surgery to 10 years after surgery, excluding expenditures associated with the initial bariatric surgical procedure.Among 9954 veterans with severe , 7387 (74.2%) were men; the mean (SD) age was 52.3 (8.8) years for the surgery cohort and 52.5 (8.7) years for the nonsurgery cohort. Mean total expenditures for the surgery cohort were $5093 (95% CI, $4811-$5391) at 7 to 12 months before surgery, which increased to $7448 (95% CI, $6989-$7936) at 6 months after surgery. Postsurgical expenditures decreased to $6692 (95% CI, $6197-$7226) at 5 years after surgery, followed by a gradual increase to $8495 (95% CI, $7609-$9484) at 10 years after surgery. Total expenditures were higher in the surgery cohort than in the nonsurgery cohort during the 3 years before surgery and in the first 2 years after surgery. The expenditures of the 2 cohorts converged 5 to 10 years after surgery. Outpatient pharmacy expenditures were significantly lower among the surgery cohort in all years of follow-up ($509 lower at 3 years before surgery and $461 lower at 7 to 12 months before surgery), but these cost reductions were offset by higher inpatient and outpatient (nonpharmacy) expenditures.In this cohort study of 9954 predominantly older male veterans with severe , total health care expenditures increased immediately after patients underwent bariatric surgery but converged with those of patients who had not undergone surgery at 10 years after surgery. This finding suggests that the value of bariatric surgery lies primarily in its associations with improvements in health and not in its potential to decrease health care costs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667648>Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale in Overweight and 's Psychometric Properties (SOCRATES-OO).</a></h2><p>The present study investigated the psychometric properties of the Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES) in the context of overweight and .

However, which specific factors affect risk and the strength of these effects are unknown. We aimed to examine the relationship between potentially modifiable risk factors and colorectal cancer.We used a random-effects model to examine the relationship between 39 potentially modifiable risk factors and colorectal cancer in 26 397 patients with colorectal cancer and 41 481 controls (ie, people without colorectal cancer). These population data came from a genome-wide association study of people of European ancestry, which was amended to exclude UK BioBank data. In the model, we used genetic variants as instruments via two-sample mendelian randomisation to limit bias from confounding and reverse causation. We calculated odds ratios per genetically predicted SD unit increase in each putative risk factor (OR) for colorectal cancer risk. We did mendelian randomisation Egger regressions to identify evidence of potential violations of mendelian randomisation assumptions. A Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p=1·3 × 10 was considered significant, and p values less than 0·05 were considered to be suggestive of an association.No putative risk factors were significantly associated with colorectal cancer risk after correction for multiple testing. However, suggestive associations with increased risk were noted for genetically predicted body fat percentage (OR 1·14 [95% CI 1·03-1·25]; p=0·0086), body-mass index (1·09 [1·01-1·17]; p=0·023), waist circumference (1·13 [1·02-1·26]; p=0·018), basal metabolic rate (1·10 [1·03-1·18]; p=0·0079), and concentrations of LDL cholesterol (1·14 [1·04-1·25]; p=0·0056), total cholesterol (1·09 [1·01-1·18]; p=0·025), circulating serum iron (1·17 [1·00-1·36]; p=0·049), and serum vitamin B12 (1·21 [1·04-1·42]; p=0·016), although potential pleiotropy among genetic variants used as instruments for vitamin B12 constrains the finding. A suggestive association was also noted between adult height and increased risk of colorectal cancer (OR 1·04 [95% CI 1·00-1·08]; p=0·032). Low blood selenium concentration had a suggestive association with decreased risk of colorectal cancer (OR 0·85 [95% CI 0·75-0·96]; p=0·0078) based on a single variant, as did plasma concentrations of interleukin-6 receptor subunit α (also based on a single variant; 0·98 [0·96-1·00]; p=0·035).

This study aimed to examine the prevalence of aortic sclerosis or stenosis in 71-years-old men and determine which risk factors at 50 years of age predict the development of aortic sclerosis or aortic stenosis. . A random sample of Swedish men from the general population, born in 1943 ( = 798) were followed for 21 years. Data on clinical characteristics and laboratory values were collected in 1993. An echocardiography was performed in 2014. We used logistic regression to examine the association between baseline data and the outcome. . Echocardiography was performed in 535 men, and aortic sclerosis or aortic stenosis was diagnosed in 27 (5.0%). 14 persons developed aortic stenosis (2.6%). Among men with aortic sclerosis or aortic stenosis, 29.6% were obese. In multivariable stepwise regression model, body mass index (odds ratio per unit increase 1.23 (95% CI 1.10-1.38;  = .0003)) and hypercholesterolemia, combined with high sensitive C-reactive protein (odds ratio versus all other 2.66 (1.18-6.00;  = .019)) were significantly associated with increased risk of developing aortic sclerosis or aortic stenosis. Body mass index was the only factor significantly associated with a higher risk of developing aortic stenosis. . The prevalence of either aortic sclerosis or aortic stenosis was 5% and of aortic stenosis 2.6%.  and hypercholesterolemia combined with elevated high sensitive C-reactive protein at the age of 50 predicted the development of degenerative aortic sclerosis or stenosis, whilst only  was correlated with the occurrence of aortic stenosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671360>Inter-correlated gut microbiota and SCFAs changes upon antibiotics exposure links with rapid body-mass gain in weaned piglet model.</a></h2><p>The risk of overweight or  in association with early exposure of antibiotics remains an important public issue for health-care of children. Low-dose antibiotics (LDA) have been widely used to enhance growth rate of pigs, providing a good animal model to study the underlying mechanism. In present study, 28 female piglets, weaned at 21 d, were randomly classified into two groups, receiving either a control diet or a diet supplemented with LDA for 4 weeks. The total bacterial load and intestinal microbiota were determined by qPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. UPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS and RNA-seq were further used to determine the colonic SCFAs and transcriptomes. Results showed that LDA significantly increased growth rate and food intake. The F/B index, Methanosphaera species, and the pathway of "carbohydrate metabolism" were improved by LDA exposure, indicating the better carbohydrate degradation and energy utilization. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated the microbial community contributing to SCFAs production was enriched upon LDA exposure, associating with increased concentrations of short-chain and branched-chain fatty acids (caproate, 2-methyl butyrate and 4-methyl valerate). A multivariate linear fitting model analysis highlighted that caproate was positively correlated with two genera (Faecalibacterium and Allisonella) and four differentially expressed genes (ZNF134, TBX5, NEU4 and SEMA6D), which were all significantly increased upon LDA exposure. Collectively, our study indicates that the growth-promoting effect of LDA exposure in early life is associated with the shifts of colonic microbiota to increase utilization of carbohydrates and energy, enhanced SCFAs production and colonic functions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, disproportionally changing body mass index (BMI) distributions pose particular challenges. Flexible modeling of the shape of BMI distributions may improve prediction performance.We used data from repeated national health surveys conducted in Mexico, Colombia and Peru at four or five time points between 1988 and 2014. Data from all surveys except the last survey were used to construct prediction models for three  indicators (median BMI, overweight/ prevalence and  prevalence) for the time of the last survey. We assessed their performance using predicted curves, absolute prediction errors and comparison of actual and predicted distributions. With one method, we modeled the shape of BMI distributions assuming BMI follows a Box-Cox Power Exponential (BCPE) distribution, whose parameters were modeled as a function of interval or nominal 5-year age groups, time and their interaction terms. In a second method, we modeled each of the  indicators directly as a function of the same covariates using quantile and logistic regression.The BCPE model with interval age groups yielded the best prediction performance in predicting  prevalence. Average absolute prediction errors across all age groups were 4.3 percentage points (95% percentile interval: 1.9, 7.5), 2.5 (1.2, 6.1) and 1.7 (1.0, 9.3), with data from Mexico, Colombia and Peru, respectively. This superiority was weak or none for overweight/ prevalence and median BMI.The BCPE model performed better for prediction of the extremes of BMI distribution, possibly by incorporating its shape more precisely.© The Author(s) 2019; all rights reserved.

Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the association between objectively measured PA and different clinical adiposity measures in a large sample of preschoolers.Four hundred sixty-three predominantly normal-weight (77%) 2-6-year-old preschool children participated in the Swiss Preschoolers' Health Study (SPLASHY). Physical activity was measured using accelerometers and was analyzed using 15-s (uni-axial) epoch length using validated cut-offs. Adiposity measures included body mass index (BMI), the sum of four skinfolds, and waist circumference (WC). Multilevel linear regression modeling, adjusted for age, sex and wear time, was used to assess the association between PA and SB with BMI, WC, and skinfold thickness.Total PA and different PA intensities were positively and SB was inversely associated with BMI in the total sample and in the normal-weight children (p < 0.05). Total PA was inversely associated with skinfold thickness in overweight and obese children (p < 0.05), while there was only a weak association for vigorous PA (p > 0.05). Moderate and moderate-to-vigorous PA were positively, and SB was negatively associated with WC in the total sample and in the normal-weight children (p < 0.05). Additional adjustment for potential sociocultural and biological confounding variables attenuated some of the results.In this very young and predominantly normal-weight population, PA is positively related to BMI and WC, but this relationship is not observed in overweight and obese children. In this latter population, PA is inversely, and SB is positively related to skinfold thickness. Skinfold thickness could represent a useful and simple clinical measure of body fat in preschoolers. The role of vigorous PA in the prevention of early childhood  should be further investigated in future studies.ISRCTN ISRCTN41045021 .

This study aimed to verify the impact of acute maximal exercise on oxidative stress markers and the BDNF production by stimulated PBMC from sedentary and physically active obese men.PBMC from twelve sedentary obese (SED group) and twelve regular exercisers (EXE group) obese men were collected before, immediately and 1-h after maximal exercise. PBMC were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to evaluate the BDNF and nitrite production, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities.PBMC from EXE group presented higher BDNF production (p=0.03) and lower TBARS levels than SED group at baseline. Maximal exercise increased BDNF and nitrite production, and lipid peroxidation immediately and 1-h after the bout in both groups. The EXE group presented higher superoxide dismutase activity immediately after bout and higher catalase activity 1-h after bout in PBMC. On the other hand, PBMC from SED group had lower superoxide dismutase activity immediately after exercise.

This review examines energy homeostasis and food intake behaviors, specifically with regards to hormones, peptides, and neurotransmitters in the periphery and central nervous system, and their potential role in . Dysfunction in feeding signals by the brain is a factor in . The hypothalamic (arcuate nucleus) and brainstem (nucleus tractus solitaris) areas integrate behavioral, endocrine, and autonomic responses via afferent and efferent pathways from and to the brainstem and peripheral organs. Neurons present in the arcuate nucleus express pro-opiomelanocortin, Neuropeptide Y, and Agouti Related Peptide, with the former involved in lowering food intake, and the latter two acutely increasing feeding behaviors. Action of peripheral hormones from the gut, pancreas, adipose, and liver are also involved in energy homeostasis. Vagal afferent neurons are also important in regulating energy homeostasis. Peripheral signals respond to the level of stored and currently available fuel. By studying their actions, new agents maybe developed that disable orexigenic responses and enhance anorexigenic signals. Although there are relatively few medications currently available for  treatment, a number of agents are in development that work through these pathways.© 2017 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668975>Characteristics of newly diagnosed adults with type 1 diabetes in the UK and evolution of glycaemic control, body mass index and Charlson comorbidity index over the first 5 years after diagnosis.</a></h2><p>This retrospective, longitudinal study characterised 2430 adults (mean age 40.8±16.1years) with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes (T1D) over the first 5years of insulin treatment.Data from 1year pre- and up to 5 years post-insulin initiation were extracted from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (1990-2013).

Melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R), contributes to appetite control in hypothalamic neurons and is a target for future anti- treatments (such as setmelanotide) or novel drug development effort. Proper MC4R trafficking regulation in hypothalamic neurons is crucial for normal neural control of homeostasis and is altered in  and in presence of lipids. The mechanisms underlying altered MC4R trafficking in the context of  is still unclear. Here, we discovered that C2CD5 expressed in the hypothalamus is involved in the regulation of MC4R endocytosis. This study unmasked a novel trafficking protein nutritionally regulated in the hypothalamus providing a novel target for MC4R dependent pathways involved in bodyweight homeostasis and .To evaluate the expression of C2cd5, we first used in situ hybridization and RNAscope technology in combination with electronic microscopy. For in vivo, we characterized the energy balance of wild type (WT) and C2CD5 whole-body knockout (C2CD5KO) mice fed normal chow (NC) and/or western-diet (high-fat/high-sucrose/cholesterol) (WD). To this end, we performed comprehensive longitudinal assessment of bodyweight, energy balance (food intake, energy expenditure, locomotor activity using TSE metabolic cages), and glucose homeostasis. In addition, we evaluated the consequence of loss of C2CD5 on feeding behavior changes normally induced by MC4R agonist (Melanotan, MTII) injection in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH). For in vitro approach, we tease out the role of C2CD5 and its calcium sensing domain C2 in MC4R trafficking. We focused on endocytosis of MC4R using an antibody feeding experiment (in a neuronal cell line - Neuro2A (N2A) stably expressing HA-MC4R-GFP; against HA-tag and analyzed by flux cytometry).We found that 1) the expression of hypothalamic C2CD5 is decreased in diet-induced  models compared to controls, 2) mice lacking C2CD5 exhibit an increase in food intake compared to WT mice, 3) C2CD5 interacts with endocytosis machinery in hypothalamus, 4) loss of functional C2CD5 (lacking C2 domain) blunts MC4R endocytosis in vitro and increases MC4R at the surface that fails to respond to MC4R ligand, and, 5) C2CD5KO mice exhibit decreased acute responses to MTII injection into the PVH.Based on these, we conclude that hypothalamic C2CD5 is involved in MC4R endocytosis and regulate bodyweight homeostasis. These studies suggest that C2CD5 represents a new protein regulated by metabolic cues and involved in metabolic receptor endocytosis.

This study aims to examine the relationship between adiposity, thyroid hormone levels and immunity by comparing resting energy expenditure (REE), serum thyroid hormone levels and complement C3 in normal-weight high body fat (normal weight ) women and normal-weight normal body fat women.In this case-control study, 40 women with normal body weight (BMI < 24.9 kg/m2) and body fat mass (FM) ≥ 30% (normal-weight  (NWO) group), and 30 non-obese women (BMI < 24.9 kg/m2) and FM < 30% (non-normal weight  (non-NWO) group) were recruited from a sport club in Tehran. Body composition was analyzed using bioimpedance analyzer. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for fasting serum concentration of thyroid hormones (including total T3 and total T4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and serum complement C3. REE was measured by an indirect calorimetry.Serum T3 and T4 and also complement C3 were higher in the NWO group than in the non-NWO group. Body fat percentages had significant positive correlation with T3 (r; 0.344,  <  0.05), T4 (r; 0.294,  <  0.05), and complement C3 (r; 0.417, P <  0.05). Serum T3 and T4 were also positively correlated with C3 concentration (r; 0.417,  <  0.001) and (r; 0.349,  <  0.05); respectively, but there was no significant correlation between TSH and C3. REE was not significantly different between the two groups. REE only had a significant positive correlation with fat-free mass (r; 0.421,  <  0.001).An increase in body fat even in the presence of a normal body weight can be accompanied by the changes in thyroid function and inflammatory markers such as complement C3.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672694>More on  - physical education for all.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671410>Postoperative expression of Cushing disease in a young male: metamorphosis of silent corticotroph adenoma?</a></h2><p>Silent corticotroph adenoma (SCA) is an unusual type of nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma (NFA) that is silent both clinically and biochemically and can only be recognized by positive immunostaining for ACTH. Under rare circumstances, it can transform into hormonally active disease presenting with severe Cushing syndrome. It might often produce diagnostic dilemma with difficult management issue if not thoroughly investigated and subtyped accordingly following surgery. Here, we present a 21-year-old male who initially underwent pituitary adenomectomy for presumed NFA with compressive symptoms. However, he developed recurrent and invasive macroadenoma with severe clinical as well as biochemical hypercortisolism during post-surgical follow-up. Repeat pituitary surgery was carried out urgently as there was significant optic chiasmal compression. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor tissue obtained on repeat surgery proved it to be an aggressive corticotroph adenoma. Though not cured, he showed marked clinical and biochemical improvement in the immediate postoperative period. Anticipating recurrence from the residual tumor, we referred him for cyber knife radio surgery.Pituitary NFA commonly present with compressive symptoms such as headache and blurred vision. Post-surgical development of Cushing syndrome in such a case could be either drug induced or endogenous. In the presence of recurrent pituitary tumor, ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome indicates CD. Rarely a SCA presenting initially as NFA can transform into an active corticotroph adenoma.

Herein, we discuss the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) performed in an obese patient with SLE while undergoing long-term steroid therapy.A 36-year-old female, suffering from SLE for 10 years with effects on the central nervous system, developed diabetes mellitus (DM) triggered by the steroid therapy for SLE. The patient was undergoing steroid therapy (6 mg/day) for SLE since a long time. For DM management, her HbA1c level was maintained at 7.4%. She was 158 cm tall and 91.6 kg in weight. Her body mass index was 36.7. She could not work and depended on welfare services. To improve her  and DM, physicians suggested that she should undergo bariatric surgery in our hospital. Eventually, she underwent LSG, which lasted for 185 min, with minimal blood loss and without complications. Her blood glucose level stabilized immediately after the surgery; hence, her antidiabetic medication was discontinued. She was discharged 8 days after surgery, and her weight decreased steadily. In the first year after surgery, her weight was 54.4 kg, and she had lost approximately 37 kg from her initial weight. Her steroid requirement had also reduced to 4 mg/day. Through weight loss, she could begin to work and became a part of society again.LSG was safely performed in an obese patient with SLE undergoing long-term steroid therapy. We noted substantial weight loss, improved DM condition, and reduced requirement of SLE therapy after surgery. Hence, surgical risks must be carefully examined before patients undergo bariatric surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672441>Supervised lifestyle intervention for people with metabolic syndrome improves outcomes and reduces individual risk factors of metabolic syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome is characterised by a clustering of metabolic risk factors including abdominal , raised triglycerides, lowered HDL cholesterol, hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance. Multifaceted lifestyle interventions including diet and exercise are recommended as the first-line treatment for the metabolic syndrome.To investigate the effects of lifestyle interventions that include both diet interventions and supervised exercise on outcomes for people with metabolic syndrome.A systematic review and meta-regression was conducted. PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched from the earliest date possible until November 2018 to identify randomised controlled trials examining the effects of lifestyle interventions compared to usual care on patient health outcomes and components of metabolic syndrome. Post-intervention means and standard deviations were pooled using inverse variance methods and random-effects models to calculate mean differences (MD), standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).Searching identified 2598 articles, of which 15 articles reporting data from 10 trials, with 1160 participants were included in this review. Compared to usual care, supervised lifestyle intervention demonstrated significant improvements in all but one of the components of metabolic syndrome. Reductions were seen in waist circumference (-4.9 cm, 95%CI -8.0 to -1.7), systolic blood pressure (-6.5 mmHg, 95%CI -10.7 to -2.3), diastolic blood pressure (-1.9 mmHg, 95%CI -3.6 to -0.2), triglycerides (SMD -0.46, 95%CI -0.88 to -0.04) and fasting glucose (SMD -0.68, 95%CI -1.20 to -0.15). Prevalence of metabolic syndrome was reduced by 39% in intervention group participants compared to control group participants (Risk Ratio 0.61, 95%CI 0.38 to 0.96). Improvements in quality of life were not statistically significant.There is low to moderate quality evidence that supervised multifaceted lifestyle intervention improves multiple risk factors of metabolic syndrome, as well as reducing prevalence of the disease. Health services should consider implementing lifestyle intervention programs for people with metabolic syndrome to improve health outcomes and prevent progression to chronic disease.Copyright © 2019.

As gut microbial imbalances and maladaptive host responses have been implicated in the pathology of  and diabetes, this study aimed to determine the effects of pharmacologically stimulated GLP-1 and GLP-2 receptor function on the gut microbiome composition in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. DIO mice received treatment with a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist (liraglutide, 0.2 mg/kg, BID) or dual GLP-1/GLP-2 receptor agonist (GUB09-145, 0.04 mg/kg, BID) for 4 weeks. Both compounds suppressed caloric intake, promoted a marked weight loss, improved glucose tolerance and reduced plasma cholesterol levels. 16S rDNA sequencing and deep-sequencing shotgun metagenomics was applied for comprehensive within-subject profiling of changes in gut microbiome signatures. Compared to baseline, DIO mice assumed phylogenetically similar gut bacterial compositional changes following liraglutide and GUB09-145 treatment, characterized by discrete shifts in low-abundant species and related bacterial metabolic pathways. The microbiome alterations may potentially associate to the converging biological actions of GLP-1 and GLP-2 receptor signaling on caloric intake, glucose metabolism and lipid handling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662726>Cigarette Smoking: An Accessory to the Development of Insulin Resistance.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance is a condition characterized by decreased sensitivity of a skeletal or adipose cell to insulin, resulting in decreased glucose uptake by the cell. This can lead to hyperinsulinemia and further reduce insulin sensitivity. Insulin resistance is one of the primary factors contributing to metabolic syndrome (MetS), causing elevated glucose and fatty acid concentrations in the blood. Smoking is associated with insulin resistance in a dose-dependent manner. It directly increases the risk for insulin resistance, mainly via hormone activation, and may indirectly cause insulin resistance due to its effects on abdominal . Nicotine may be the factor underlying these potential mechanisms. With the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes on the rise, and considering the role of smoking and its relationship to insulin resistance, smoking reduction or cessation may be a viable option for those who are at risk or already identified as insulin resistant. Therefore, smoking cessation or reduction would serve as a beneficial component in any diabetes prevention or treatment plan.© 2017 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667892>The influence of vestibular stimulation on metabolism and body composition.</a></h2><p>, diabetes and metabolic disease represent an ongoing and rapidly worsening public health issue in both the developed, and much of the developing world. Although there are many factors that influence fat storage, it has been clearly demonstrated that the homeostatic cornerstone of metabolism lies within the hypothalamus. Moreover, neuronal damage to vital areas of the hypothalamus can drive reregulation or dysregulation of endocrine function, energy expenditure and appetite, thereby promoting a shift in overall metabolic function towards a state of . Therefore, identification of treatments that influence the hypothalamus to improve  and associated metabolic diseases has long been a medical goal. Interestingly, evidence from animal studies suggests that activating the vestibular system, specifically the macular gravity receptor, influences the hypothalamus in a way that decreases body fat storage and causes a metabolic shift towards a leaner state. Given that the macular element of the vestibular system has been shown to activate with transdermal electrical stimulation applied to the mastoids, this may be a potential therapeutic approach for , diabetes or related metabolic diseases, whereby repetitive stimulation of the vestibular system influences hypothalamic control of metabolic homeostasis, thereby encouraging decreased fat storage. Here, we present an up-to-date review of the current literature surrounding the vestibular influence of the hypothalamus and associated homeostatic sites in the context of current and novel therapeutic approaches for improved clinical management of  and diabetes.© 2019 Diabetes UK.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664141>Pre-pregnancy underweight and  are positively associated with small-for-gestational-age infants in a Chinese population.</a></h2><p>The association between suboptimal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants is not well defined. We investigated the association between pre-pregnancy BMI and the risk of SGA infants in a Chinese population. We performed a cohort study among 12029 mothers with a pregnancy. This cohort consisted of pregnant women that were: normal-weight (62.02%), underweight (17.09%), overweight (17.77%) and obese (3.12%). Birth sizes were reduced in the underweight and obese groups compared with the normal-weight group. Linear regression analysis indicated that birth size was positively associated with BMI in both the underweight and normal-weight groups. Further analysis showed that 12.74% of neonates were SGA infants in the underweight group, higher than 7.43% of neonates reported in the normal-weight group (adjusted RR = 1.92; 95% CI: 1.61, 2.30). Unexpectedly, 17.60% of neonates were SGA infants in the obese group, much higher than the normal-weight group (adjusted RR = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.57, 3.00). Additionally, 18.40% of neonates were large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants in the obese group, higher than 7.26% of neonates reported in the normal-weight group (adjusted RR = 3.00; 95% CI: 2.21, 4.06).

Between 2008 and 2011, a longitudinal study on the growth of breastfed infants was carried out in the Czech Republic. Forty-three GP pediatricians addressed parents at 18-month preventive examinations and collected data on the families' socio-economic conditions and the infants' feeding conditions. The children were measured (length, weight, and head circumference), and anthropometric measurements from 10 previous preventive examinations were obtained from the health records. Out of the collected 1775 questionnaires, 960 children were selected according to the criteria of the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study. For the purpose of this study, 799 children who were exclusively or predominantly breastfed for at least 6 months were selected. We found that the proportions of children who were classified as overweight (>90th percentile) or obese (>97th percentile) at 6, 12, and 18-month examinations were far below the proportions of the Czech references.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between d-ROMs, BAP levels, and abdominal  in the Korean adult population using clinical data.A total of 2,367 individuals, aged 18-86 years, were identified from health check-up examination records at a university hospital, between January 2015 and August 2016. Clinical and biochemical parameters, including waist circumference, lipid profile, alcohol drinking status, and smoking status, were investigated. Oxidative stress levels, viz., d-ROM concentration and antioxidant capacity, viz., BAP, were measured.Subjects with abdominal  presented significantly higher levels of d-ROMs compared to those with a normal waist circumference (P<0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, alcohol drinking status; smoking status; and triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein levels were found to have a significant positive correlation with abdominal  (P<0.001). BAP did not significantly correlate with abdominal .We observed a positive association between abdominal  and d-ROM concentration. This result indicates that abdominal  can increase oxidative stress and may affect the pathways involved in , such as the inflammatory pathway.

A questionnaire with 22 questions prepared by the researchers was used. The margin of error was 5% and the confidence level was 95%. For the calculation, the two-proportion equality, Pearson correlation and ANOVA tests were used.Among the interviewees, 43% had chronic hypertension, 33.3% presented with up to 20 weeks of gestation, 23.7% presented after the 20th week of gestation, 62.3% were between 18 and 35 years of age, 78.1% had a family history of hypertension, and among those aged 36 to 45 years, 11.4% were in the first gestation, and 26.3% in the second gestation.

Indeed, unusually slow psychomotor speed, a measure predictive of behavioural performance and health outcomes, is found with  and ageing, two conditions also associated with chronic inflammation. Yet whether inflammation is the mediating factor remains unclear. Here, we assessed inflammation by indexing interleukin-6 level in blood and measured psychomotor speed as well as indices of selective visual attention in young (mean = 26 years) or old (mean = 71 years) adults (N = 83) who were either lean or currently significantly overweight (mean body mass index = 22.4 and 33.8, respectively). Inflammation was positively and significantly correlated with psychomotor speed, age, and body mass index but not with attention measures. Using mediation analyses we show for the first time that inflammation fully accounts for the significant psychomotor slowing found in those with high BMI. Moreover, we further show that age-related psychomotor slowing is partially mediated by inflammation. These findings support the proposal that reducing inflammation may mitigate weight- and age-related cognitive decline and thereby improve performance on daily tasks and health outcomes more generally.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668872>Adipocyte Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 2α Suppresses Atherosclerosis by Promoting Adipose Ceramide Catabolism.</a></h2><p>-induced adipose dysfunction is a major contributor to atherosclerosis. Cold exposure has been reported to affect atherosclerosis through regulation of adipose function, but the mechanism has not been well clarified. Here, adipocyte hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α) was upregulated after mild cold exposure at 16°C and mediated cold-induced thermogenesis. Adipocyte HIF-2α deficiency exacerbated Western-diet-induced atherosclerosis by increasing adipose ceramide levels, which blunted hepatocyte cholesterol elimination and thermogenesis. Mechanistically, Acer2, the gene encoding alkaline ceramidase 2, was identified as a novel target gene of HIF-2α, triggering ceramide catabolism. Adipose overexpression of ACER2 rescued adipocyte HIF-2α-deficiency-induced exacerbation of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, activation of adipose HIF-2α by the HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor FG-4592 had protective effects on atherosclerosis, accompanied by a reduction in adipose and plasma ceramide and plasma cholesterol levels. This study highlights adipocyte HIF-2α as a putative drug target against atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This work assesses the efficacy of metformin in pregnancy to avert one outcome-incident GDM in women at high risk. We included RCTs comparing metformin with usual care or placebo controls in terms of incident GDM and recruiting women at high risk during early pregnancy. Eleven eligible trials enrolled 2370 adult women whose intervention arm consisted of metformin started at conception or before 20 weeks of gestation. Risk of GDM was similar in intervention compared with controls (risk ratio [RR] 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-1.24). The data were of sufficient quality meeting the criteria for consistency and directness. We conclude that metformin does not contribute to averting the GDM outcome in women at high risk when initiated in pregnancy. The evidence provided by this synthesis affirms that further broad clinical trials investigating this question are no longer needed.© 2019 World  Federation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668457>Circulating glutamate level as a potential biomarker for abdominal  and metabolic risk.</a></h2><p>Circulating level of glutamate, a by-product of the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids, has been positively correlated with visceral adipose tissue accumulation and waist circumference (WC). The aim of the present study was to assess the potential of using glutamate level to identify individuals with abdominal  and a high cardiometabolic risk.The study sample included 99 men and 99 women. Fasting serum glutamate was measured using the Biocrates p180 kit. Anthropometric and metabolic variables were used to identify individuals with abdominal  (WC ≥ 95 cm in both sexes), the hypertriglyceridemic waist (HTW) phenotype and the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Mean (±SD) age was 34.1 ± 10.1 years, mean BMI was 29.0 ± 6.2 kg/m and mean WC was 92.7 ± 16.5 cm. Glutamate was strongly correlated with WC (r = 0.66 for men; r = 0.76 for women, both p < 0.0001) and multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction, particularly fasting triglyceride level (r = 0.59 for men; r = 0.57 for women, both p < 0.0001), HDL-cholesterol level (r = -0.45, p < 0.0001 in both sexes) and the HOMA-IR index (r = 0.65 for men; r = 0.60 for women, both p < 0.0001). Logistic regressions showed that glutamate had an excellent accuracy to identify individuals with abdominal  (ROC_AUC: 0.90 for both sexes), a good accuracy to identify those with the HTW phenotype (ROC_AUC: 0.82 for men; 0.85 for women) and fair-to-good accuracy for the MetS (ROC_AUC: 0.78 for men; 0.89 for women).Glutamate level may represent an interesting potential biomarker of abdominal  and metabolic risk.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Histories were taken from all the participants, body mass indexes were calculated, and biochemical tests and suprapubic over ultrasonography were made. Zonulin was studied with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Serum zonulin levels were similar between PCOS and control groups (p = 0.893). In all participants, there were negative correlations between zonulin and the total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and non-HDL-cholesterol (respectively, p = 0.00, 0.018, 0.004, 0.002), there were boundary correlations with age and total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol (respectively, p = 0.052 and 0.058).

One hundred ninety-six children with  (101 females, 95 males) were evaluated using anthropometric measurements, dietary intakes, plasma and RBC PUFA quantification, blood biochemistry, and 55 single nucleotide polymorphisms within 14 genes. phosphatidylethanolamine -methyltransferase () rs1109859 and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene () rs4846052 genotypes were associated with PUFA levels in RBCs. PUFA intake did not influence the RBC eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels. Higher RBC DHA and EPA levels were observed for  rs1109859 GG and GA genotypes versus the AA genotype. Higher levels of RBC DHA, EPA, arachidonic acid (ARA), and linoleic acid (LA) and were observed for  rs4846052 TT genotype versus TC and CC genotypes. Genetic variations in  rs1109859 and  rs4846052 were associated with different PUFA levels in RBC membranes and are estimators for PUFA species in RBCs. Further research is needed to establish whether these genotype-specific alterations are specific to overweight children.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663845>Predictive Equations based on Body Composition for Resting Energy Expenditure estimation in adults with .</a></h2><p>An accurate estimation of resting energy expenditure (REE) in patients with  is crucial. Therefore, we aim to assess the validity of REE predictive equations based on body composition variables in treatment-seeking Arab adults with overweight and .Body composition and REE were measured by Tanita BC-418 bioimpedance and Vmax Encore 229 IC respectively, and predictive equations based on fat mass, fat-free mass were used in REE estimations among 87 adults of both genders, in the Outpatient Clinic in the Department of Nutrition and Dietetics at Beirut Arab University (Lebanon). The mean differences between the measured and estimated REE values were calculated to assess accuracy, and the Bland-Altman method was used to assess the level of agreement.Ten predictive were included. In males, all predictive equations gave significantly different estimates of REE when compared to that measured by IC. On the other hand, in females, the mean difference between the REE value estimated by Huang and Horie-Waitzberg equations and that measured using IC was not significant, and agreement was confirmed using Bland-Altman plots.We suggest Huang and Horie-Waitzberg equations for accurate REE estimation in females; however, new validated REE estimation equations for males in this population are still needed.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668904>Polymeric Carriers for Controlled Drug Delivery in  Treatment.</a></h2><p>The global rise in the prevalence of  and affiliated metabolic syndrome poses a significant threat to human health.

However, there is a paucity of information on visfatin regulation in non-mammalian species. After characterization of chicken visfatin gene, we undertook this study to determine its hormonal regulation in avian (non-mammalian) liver cells. Addition of 5 ng/mL TNFα, 100 ng/mL leptin, 1, 3, 10 or 100 ng/mL T3 for 24 h upregulated visfatin gene expression by 1.2, 1.8, 1.95, 1.75, 1.80, and 2.45 folds (P < .05), respectively, compared to untreated LMH cells. Administration of 10 ng/mL of orexin A significantly down regulated visfatin gene expression by 1.35 folds compared to control cells. In contrast, treatment with IL-6 or orexin B for 24 h did not influence visfatin mRNA abundance. These pro-inflammatory cytokines and -related hormones modulate the expression of CRP, INSIG2, and nuclear orphan receptors. Hepatic CRP gene expression was significantly upregulated by IL-6, TNFα, orexin B, and T3 and down regulated by leptin and orexin A. LXR mRNA abundances were increased by orexin A, decreased by orexin B, and T3, and did not affected by IL6, TNFα, or leptin. The expression of FXR gene was induced by IL-6, leptin, and T3, but it was not influenced by TNFα, orexin A or B. CXR gene expression was up regulated by TNFα, leptin, orexin B, and T3, down regulated by 5 ng/mL orexin A, and did not affected by IL-6. INSIG2 mRNA levels were increased by TNFα (5 ng/mL), leptin (100 ng/mL), and T3 (1, 3, 10, and 100 ng/mL), decreased by orexin A, and remained unchanged with IL-6 or orexin B treatment. Together, this is the first report showing hormonal regulation of visfatin in avian hepatocyte cells and suggesting a potential role of CRP, INSIG2, and nuclear orphan receptor LXR, FXR, and CXR in mediating these hormonal effects.Copyright © 2019.

However, there are concerns regarding potential adverse effects on body composition.To compare the long-term effects of weight loss via severe vs moderate energy restriction on lean mass and other aspects of body composition.The Type of Energy Manipulation for Promoting Optimum Metabolic Health and Body Composition in  (TEMPO) Diet Trial was a 12-month, single-center, randomized clinical trial. A total of 101 postmenopausal women, aged 45 to 65 years with body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) from 30 to 40, who were at least 5 years after menopause, had fewer than 3 hours of structured physical activity per week, and lived in the Sydney metropolitan area of New South Wales, Australia, were recruited between March 2013 and July 2016. Data analysis was conducted between October 2018 and August 2019.Participants were randomized to either 12 months of moderate (25%-35%) energy restriction with a food-based diet (moderate intervention) or 4 months of severe (65%-75%) energy restriction with a total meal replacement diet followed by moderate energy restriction for an additional 8 months (severe intervention). Both interventions had a prescribed protein intake of 1.0 g/kg of actual body weight per day, and physical activity was encouraged but not supervised.The primary outcome was whole-body lean mass at 12 months after commencement of intervention. Secondary outcomes were body weight, thigh muscle area and muscle function (strength), bone mineral density, and fat mass and distribution, measured at 0, 4, 6, and 12 months.A total of 101 postmenopausal women were recruited (mean [SD] age, 58.0 [4.2] years; mean [SD] weight, 90.8 [9.1] kg; mean [SD] body mass index, 34.4 [2.5]). Compared with the moderate group at 12 months, the severe group lost more weight (effect size, -6.6 kg; 95% CI, -8.2 to -5.1 kg), lost more whole-body lean mass (effect size, -1.2 kg; 95% CI, -2.0 to -0.4 kg), and lost more thigh muscle area (effect size, -4.2 cm2; 95% CI, -6.5 to -1.9 cm2). However, decreases in whole-body lean mass and thigh muscle area were proportional to total weight loss, and there was no difference in muscle (handgrip) strength between groups. Total hip bone mineral density (effect size, -0.017 g/cm2; 95% CI, -0.029 to -0.005 g/cm2), whole-body fat mass (effect size, -5.5 kg; 95% CI, -7.1 to -3.9 kg), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (effect size, -1890 cm3; 95% CI, -2560 to -1219 cm3), and visceral adipose tissue (effect size, -1389 cm3; 95% CI, -1748 to -1030 cm3) loss were also greater for the severe group than for the moderate group at 12 months.Severe energy restriction had no greater adverse effect on relative whole-body lean mass or handgrip strength compared with moderate energy restriction and was associated with 2-fold greater weight and fat loss over 12 months. However, there was significantly greater loss of total hip bone mineral density with severe vs moderate energy restriction. Therefore, caution is necessary when implementing severe energy restriction in postmenopausal women, particularly those with osteopenia or osteoporosis.anzctr.org.au Identifier: 12612000651886.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672155>Gut microbiome composition in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos is shaped by geographic relocation, environmental factors, and .</a></h2><p>Hispanics living in the USA may have unrecognized potential birthplace and lifestyle influences on the gut microbiome.

In addition, clock components inhibit brown adipogenesis through direct transcriptional control of key components of the transforming growth factor β pathway. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serotonin abrogates brown adipogenesis by affecting clock functionality.Nondifferentiated and differentiated HIB1B brown adipocytes were treated with serotonin, and their clock expression and functionality and differentiation state were examined.Nondifferentiated HIB1B brown adipocytes treated with serotonin showed increased brown adipocyte markers alongside increased brain-muscle Arnt-like protein 1 (Bmal1) and RAR related orphan receptor A (Rora) but decreased nuclear receptor Rev-erbα mRNA levels. BMAL1 overexpression together with serotonin led to significantly lower brown adipocyte markers. Serotonin in the differentiation cocktail led to reduced brown adipocyte markers as well as clock gene expression. After differentiation, serotonin treatment significantly decreased brown adipocyte markers and reduced BMAL1 and RORα but increased REV-ERBα protein levels. Addition of serotonin to the differentiation medium or addition after differentiation reduced activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II subunit gamma, which interferes with circadian locomoter output cycles protein kaput (CLOCK):BMAL1 dimerization and transactivation.Clock expression is required at the early stages of differentiation to brown adipocytes, and serotonin interferes with this process by modulating clock functionality.

However, this practice may be unnecessarily burdensome and time-consuming in the research setting.The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of SS criteria, and compare it to alternative approaches in adults with overweight and .In this cross-sectional, ancillary analysis, participants enrolled in a bariatric (study 1; n = 13) and lifestyle (study 2; n = 51) weight loss intervention were included. Indirect calorimetry was performed during baseline measurements using a metabolic cart for 25 min, including a 5-min stabilization period at the start. SS was defined as the first 5-min period with a coefficient of variation (CV) ≤10% for both VO and VCO (hereafter REE). Body composition was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis in study 2 participants only. REE was compared against the lowest CV (REE), 5-min time intervals (REE, REE, REE, REE), 4-min and 3-min SS intervals (REE and REE), and time intervals of 6-15, 6-20 and 6-25 min (REE, REE, and REE) using repeated measures ANOVA and Bland-Altman analysis to test for bias, limits of agreement and accuracy (±6% measured REE).Participants were 54 ± 13 years old, mostly women (75%) and had a BMI of 35 ± 5 kg/m. Overall, 54/63 (84%) of participants reached REE, often (47/54, 87%) within the first 10-min (6-15 min). Alternative approaches to estimating REE had a relatively low bias (-16 to 13 kcals), narrow limits of agreement and high accuracy (83-98%) when compared to REE, in particular, outperforming standard prediction equations (e.g., Mifflin St. Joer).Indirect calorimetry measurements that utilize the 5-min SS approach to estimate REE are considered the gold-standard. Under circumstances of non-SS, it appears 4-min and 3-min SS periods, or fixed time intervals of atleast 5 min are accurate and practical alternatives for estimating REE in adults with overweight and .

Although gender differences in MetS are well documented, little is known about sex-specific differences in the pathogenesis of COPD, especially when combined with MetS. Consequently, it is not clear whether the same treatment regime has comparable efficacy in men and women diagnosed with MetS and COPD. In the present study using sodium glutamate, lipopolysaccharide, and cigarette smoke extract, we simulated lipid metabolism disorders, , hyperglycemia, and pulmonary emphysema (comorbidity) in male and female C57BL/6 mice. We assessed the gender-specific impact of lipid metabolism disorders and pulmonary emphysema on angiogenic precursor cells (endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), pericytes, vascular smooth muscle cells, cells of the lumen of the nascent vessel), as well as the biological effects of pegylated glucagon-like peptide 1 (pegGLP-1) in this experimental paradigm. Simulation of MetS/COPD comorbidity caused an accumulation of EPC (CD45CD31CD34), pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells in the lungs of female mice. In contrast, the number of cells involved in the angiogenesis decreased in the lungs of male animals. PegGLP-1 had a positive effect on lipids and area under the curve (AUC), , and prevented the development of pulmonary emphysema. The severity of these effects was stronger in males than in females. Furthermore, PegGLP-1 stimulated regeneration of pulmonary endothelium. At the same time, PegGLP-1 administration caused a mobilization of EPC (CD45CD31CD34) into the bloodstream in females and migration of precursors of angiogenesis and vascular smooth muscle cells to the lungs in male animals. Gender differences in stimulatory action of pegGLP-1 on CD31 endothelial lung cells in vitro were not observed. Based on these findings, we postulated that the cellular mechanism of in vivo regeneration of lung epithelium was at least partly gender-specific. Thus, we concluded that a pegGLP-1-based treatment regime for metabolic disorder and COPD should be further developed primarily for male patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665164>Caesarean section delivery and childhood  in a British longitudinal cohort study.</a></h2><p>Several studies reported an association between Caesarean section (CS) birth and childhood . However, there are several limitations in the current literature. These include an inability to distinguish between planned and emergency CS, small study sample sizes and not adjusting for pre-pregnancy body-mass-index (BMI). We examined the association between CS delivery and childhood  using the United Kingdom Millennium Cohort Study (MCS).Mother-infant pairs were recruited into the MCS. Use of sampling weights ensured the sample was representative of the population. The exposure was categorised as normal vaginal delivery (VD) [reference], assisted VD, planned CS and emergency CS. Childhood  prevalence, at age three, five, seven, eleven and fourteen years was calculated using the International  Taskforce criteria. Mixed-effects linear regression models were fitted with associations adjusted for several potential confounders like maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, education and infant macrosomia. Linear regression models were fitted evaluating body fat percentage (BF%), at age seven and fourteen years.Of the 18,116 infants, 3872 (21.4%) were delivered by CS; 9.2% by planned CS.  prevalence was 5.4%, 5.7%, 6.5%, 7.1% and 7.6% at age three, five, seven, eleven and fourteen years respectively. The mixed-effects linear regression model showed no association between planned (adjusted mean difference = 0.00; [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.10; 0.10], p-value = 0.97) or emergency CS (adjusted mean difference = 0.08; [95% CI -0.01; 0.17], p-value = 0.09) and child BMI. At age seven years, there was no association between planned CS and BF% (adjusted mean difference = 0.13; [95% CI -0.23; 0.49]); there was no association at age fourteen years.Infants born by planned CS did not have a significantly higher BMI or BF% compared to those born by normal VD.

From the beginning of HFD, HFD-induced mice were subjected to amlexanox or vehicle for 18 weeks. HFD+LPS-induced mice were treated with amlexanox or vehicle for the last 6 weeks. Blood biochemistry parameters were determined using automatic biochemistry analyzer. Histological changes of liver tissue were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and Oil Red O staining. The expressions of IKKε and smooth muscle actin-α (α-SMA) were evaluated through immunohistochemistry. Serum inflammatory mediator was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Gene expressions involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin signaling pathway were examined using quantitative RT-PCR or Western blotting.This study demonstrated that amlexanox reversed glucose and lipid metabolic disturbance and hepatic steatosis in NAFLD mice model.

We report the laparoscopic management of such a case and make observations from similar case presentations published in the literature. A 26-year-old woman had an intragastric balloon placed endoscopically for weight control 13 months previously. She presented to the emergency department with a four-day history of intermittent abdominal cramps and vomiting. Contrast enhanced computed tomography confirmed the presence of the intragastric balloon within the small bowel. At laparoscopic retrieval, the deflated intragastric balloon was found impacted in the terminal ileum approximately 15 cm from the ileocaecal valve. The balloon was retrieved by enterotomy and primary closure of the ileum without event. The risk of balloon deflation and subsequent migration increases over time but several published cases demonstrate that this complication can occur within six months of insertion. The initial approach to the treatment of migrated intragastric balloons causing small bowel obstruction should be determined by the location of impaction, severity of obstruction and the available skill set of the attending radiologist, endoscopist and/or surgeon. Balloons causing obstruction in the duodenum are likely amenable to endoscopic retrieval whereas impaction within the jejunum or ileum could be managed by percutaneous needle aspiration (in selected cases), endoscopy (double-balloon enteroscopy), laparoscopy or open surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667363>Adipocyte browning and resistance to  in mice is induced by expression of ATF3.</a></h2><p>Billions of people have -related metabolic syndromes such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia.

Pregnant women with these risk factors in a refugee community emigrating from a conflict-zone nation should be followed up closely.©Copyright 2019 by Turkish Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology | Turkish Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology published by Galenos Publishing House.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664652>Impact of Bariatric Surgery on Female Sexual Function in Obese Patients: a Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>We aimed to make a meta-analysis regarding the effect of bariatric surgery on female sexual function. PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched from database inception through August 2019. Articles were eligible for inclusion if they examined the effect of bariatric surgery on obese women's sexual function assessed by the Female Sexual Functioning Index (FSFI) or/and the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12). Twenty articles were included into meta-analysis. Bariatric surgery was associated with significant increase in the total FSFI score. When parameters included in the FSFI scoring system were separately evaluated, significant improvements were observed in sexual desire, sexual arousal, lubrication, orgasm, sexual satisfaction, and sexual pain. However, the PISQ-12 and FSFI scores in women with pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) were not significantly changed postoperatively. Bariatric surgery improves female sexual function in obese patients, but not in women with PFD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665216>Association of Copy Number Variation of the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 Region With Cortical and Subcortical Morphology and Cognition.</a></h2><p>Recurrent microdeletions and duplications in the genomic region 15q11.2 between breakpoints 1 (BP1) and 2 (BP2) are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. These structural variants are present in 0.5% to 1.0% of the population, making 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 the site of the most prevalent known pathogenic copy number variation (CNV). It is unknown to what extent this CNV influences brain structure and affects cognitive abilities.To determine the association of the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 deletion and duplication CNVs with cortical and subcortical brain morphology and cognitive task performance.In this genetic association study, T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging were combined with genetic data from the ENIGMA-CNV consortium and the UK Biobank, with a replication cohort from Iceland. In total, 203 deletion carriers, 45 247 noncarriers, and 306 duplication carriers were included. Data were collected from August 2015 to April 2019, and data were analyzed from September 2018 to September 2019.The associations of the CNV with global and regional measures of surface area and cortical thickness as well as subcortical volumes were investigated, correcting for age, age2, sex, scanner, and intracranial volume. Additionally, measures of cognitive ability were analyzed in the full UK Biobank cohort.Of 45 756 included individuals, the mean (SD) age was 55.8 (18.3) years, and 23 754 (51.9%) were female. Compared with noncarriers, deletion carriers had a lower surface area (Cohen d = -0.41; SE, 0.08; P = 4.9 × 10-8), thicker cortex (Cohen d = 0.36; SE, 0.07; P = 1.3 × 10-7), and a smaller nucleus accumbens (Cohen d = -0.27; SE, 0.07; P = 7.3 × 10-5). There was also a significant negative dose response on cortical thickness (β = -0.24; SE, 0.05; P = 6.8 × 10-7). Regional cortical analyses showed a localization of the effects to the frontal, cingulate, and parietal lobes. Further, cognitive ability was lower for deletion carriers compared with noncarriers on 5 of 7 tasks.These findings, from the largest CNV neuroimaging study to date, provide evidence that 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 structural variation is associated with brain morphology and cognition, with deletion carriers being particularly affected. The pattern of results fits with known molecular functions of genes in the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 region and suggests involvement of these genes in neuronal plasticity. These neurobiological effects likely contribute to the association of this CNV with neurodevelopmental disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665202>Dietary quality among children from 6 months to 4 years, NHANES 2011-2016.</a></h2><p>The US Dietary Guidelines for Americans provide dietary recommendations for individuals aged ≥2 y and metrics exist to assess alignment. Nonfederal feeding recommendations exist for children <2 y, but limited metrics and assessment of dietary quality are available.We aimed to assess dietary quality of children aged 6 mo-4 y using a modified Diet Quality Index Score (DQIS).NHANES 2011-2016 dietary data were used to estimate the dietary quality of children 6 mo-4 y old using a modified DQIS. Differences in mean modified DQIS by demographics were assessed using linear regression.Mean modified DQIS ± SE was 22.4 ± 0.23 out of 45 possible points (50%) for children 6 mo-4 y of age on a given day. Modified DQIS scores on a given day decreased with age (27.7 ± 0.27 for 6- to 11-mo-olds, 23.9 ± 0.31 for 1-y-olds, 21.4 ± 0.26 for 2- to 3-y-olds, and 20.6 ± 0.49 for 4-y-olds; P < 0.0001 for trend). Children 6-11 mo old had 16% higher overall modified DQIS scores than 1-y-olds (P < 0.0001) and higher modified DQIS subcomponent scores for refined grains and protein, indicating higher age-appropriate intakes (P < 0.05). Similarly, children 6-11 mo old also had higher modified DQIS subcomponent scores, indicating no or limited intake, for 100% fruit juice, sugar-sweetened beverages, other added sugars, and salty snacks (P < 0.02).Dietary quality declines with age and may begin as early as 1 y. The modified DQIS tool could help assess the dietary quality of young children. This may be important when identifying programmatic and policy efforts aimed at establishing and maintaining healthy dietary patterns beginning at an early age.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665000>BMI is associated with FEV decline in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a meta-analysis of clinical trials.</a></h2><p>There is considerable heterogeneity in the rate of lung function decline in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the determinants of which are largely unknown. Observational studies in COPD indicate that low body mass index (BMI) is associated with worse outcomes, and overweight/ has a protective effect - the so-called " paradox". We aimed to determine the relationship between BMI and the rate of FEV decline in data from published clinical trials in COPD.We performed a systematic review of the literature, and identified 5 randomized controlled trials reporting the association between BMI and FEV decline. Four of these were included in the meta-analyses. We analyzed BMI in 4 categories: BMI-I (< 18.5 or <  20 kg/m), BMI-II (18.5 or 20 to < 25 kg/m), BMI-III (25 to < 29 or < 30 kg/m) and BMI-IV (≥29 or ≥ 30 kg/m). We then performed a meta-regression of all the estimates against the BMI category.The estimated rate of FEV decline decreased with increasing BMI. Meta-regression of the estimates showed that BMI was significantly associated with the rate of FEV decline (linear trend p = 1.21 × 10).These novel findings support the  paradox in COPD: compared to normal BMI, low BMI is a risk factor for accelerated lung function decline, whilst high BMI has a protective effect. The relationship may be due to common but as-of-yet unknown causative factors; further investigation into which may reveal novel endotypes or targets for therapeutic intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674694>Sarcolipin expression in human skeletal muscle: influence of energy balance and exercise.</a></h2><p>Sarcolipin (SLN) is a SERCAs uncoupling protein associated with exercise performance and lower adiposity in mice. To determine SLN protein expression in human skeletal muscle and its relationship with adiposity, resting energy expenditure (REE), and performance, SLN was assessed by Western blot in 199 biopsies from two previous studies. In one study, 15 overweight volunteers underwent a pre-test followed by four days of caloric restriction and exercise (45min one-arm cranking + 8h walking), and three days on a control diet. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the trained and non-exercised deltoid, and vastus lateralis (VL). In another study, 16 men performed seven sessions of 4-6x30-sec all-out sprints on the cycle ergometer with both limbs, and their VL and triceps brachii biopsied pre- and post-training. SLN expression was two-fold and 44% higher in the VL than in the deltoids and triceps brachii, respectively. SLN was associated neither with adiposity nor REE, and was not altered by a severe energy deficit (5,500 kcal/d). SLN and cortisol changes after the energy deficit were correlated (r=0.38, P=0.039). SLN was not altered by low-intensity exercise in the overweight subjects, whereas it was reduced after sprint training in the other group. The changes in SLN with sprint training were inversely associated with the changes in gross efficiency (r=-0.59, P=0.016). No association was observed between aerobic or anaerobic performance and SLN expression. In conclusion, sarcolipin appears to play no role in regulating the fat mass of men. Sprint training reduces sarcolipin expression, which may improve muscle efficiency.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The cell types and the precursor cells of PVAT appear to be different according to their location, with the component cell type including white, brown, and beige adipocytes. PVAT releases a panel of adipokines and cytokines that maintain vascular homeostasis, but it also has the ability of intervention in the pathogenesis of the atherosclerotic plaques development and in the vascular tone modulation. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge and discuss the role of PVAT as a major contributing factor in the pathogenesis of ischemic coronary disease, hypertension, , and diabetes mellitus. The new perspective of PVAT as an endocrine organ, along with the recent knowledge of the mechanisms involved in dysfunctional PVAT intervention in local vascular homeostasis perturbations, nowadays represent a new area of research in cardiovascular pathology, aiming to discover new therapeutic methods.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675159>Childhood  and the Food Environment: A Population-Based Sample of Public School Children in New York City.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to examine the relationship between proximity to healthy and unhealthy food outlets around children's homes and their weight outcomes.A total of 3,507,542 student-year observations of height and weight data from the 2009-2013 annual FitnessGram assessment of New York City public school students were used. BMI z scores were calculated, student  or /overweight was determined using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts, and these data were combined with the locations of four food outlet types (fast-food restaurants, wait-service restaurants, corner stores, and supermarkets) to calculate distance to the nearest outlet. Associations between weight status outcomes and distance to these food outlet types were examined using neighborhood (census tract) fixed effects.Living farther than 0.025 mile (about half of a city block) from the nearest fast-food restaurant was associated with lower  and /overweight risk and lower BMI z scores. Results ranged from 2.5% to 4.4% decreased . Beyond this distance, there were generally no impacts of the food environment and little to no impact of other food outlet types.Proximity to fast-food restaurants was inversely related to childhood , but no relationships beyond that were seen.

Empagliflozin and dulaglutide, developed for diabetes, reduce weight, decrease insulin resistance, and exert additive effects. We evaluated the efficacy of empagliflozin, dulaglutide, and their combination on -induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and lung fibrosis using a murine model. We assigned C57BL/6J mice to five groups: control, high-fat diet (HFD), and HFD with empagliflozin, dulaglutide, or both. Mice received a 12-week HFD, empagliflozin (5 days/week, oral gavage), and dulaglutide (once weekly, intraperitoneally). Both drugs significantly attenuated HFD-induced weight increase, abnormal glucose metabolism, and abnormal serum levels of leptin and insulin, and co-treatment was more effective. Both drugs significantly alleviated HFD-induced AHR, increased macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and co-treatment was more effective on AHR. HFD-induced lung fibrosis was decreased by both drugs alone and combined. HFD induced interleukin (IL)-17, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and IL-1β mRNA and protein expression, which was significantly reduced by empagliflozin, dulaglutide, and their combination. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-6 showed similar patterns without significant differences. HFD-enhanced T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cell differentiation was improved by both drugs.

Antenatal care provided by a general practitioner (GP) in the primary care setting is an important model of care, particularly for women in regional areas where rates of overweight and  are highest. The aim of this study is to explore GPs' perceptions and experiences of implementing GWG recommendations in GP-led antenatal care.A qualitative exploratory approach recorded GPs' experiences and insights regarding the application of GWG recommendations in practice. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews informed by the revised Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Deductive thematic analysis grouped coded text into TDF domains from which main themes were generated.Twenty GPs (13 female, 7 male) from metropolitan and regional Victoria, Australia participated. Codes related to at least one of 11 TDF domains. Five main themes were apparent: 1) Despite low awareness of guidelines, GWG advice is provided; 2) 'I should do this more'; 3) Lack of everyday resources; 4) Working 'against the odds' at times; and 5) Optimism and reality. GPs were aware of the importance of optimal GWG however, other pregnancy-related issues are given precedence during consultations. Enablers for the implementation of GWG guidelines were practitioner-based and included GPs' strong sense of their professional role to provide advice, and ongoing and trusting relationships with women throughout pregnancy. Barriers were mostly health system-based with limited time, remuneration, and restrictive referral pathways being limiting factors.There is a need to support GPs to provide GWG advice in accordance with current national guidelines. Solutions potentially lie in strategies that promote the effective dissemination and uptake of guidelines, and changes to policy and funding within the health-system so that longer GP-led antenatal care consultations are remunerated and referrals to allied health are accessible to women who require additional support to optimise GWG.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664519>Dietary intervention using (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a fungus-derived soluble prebiotic ameliorates high-fat diet-induced metabolic distress and alters beneficially the gut microbiota in mice model.</a></h2><p>Western diet, rich in carbohydrates and fat, is said to be a major factor underlying metabolic syndrome. Interventions with prebiotics, the key modulators of the gut microbiota, have paramount impact on host-associated metabolic disorders. Herein, we investigated the effect of fungus-derived (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a highly soluble dietary fiber, on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic distress.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with different diet groups (n = 11): control diet, HFD, 3 g/kg or 5 g/kg of β-glucan-incorporated HFD. At the end of experimental study period (12th week), body weight, feces weight and fecal moisture content were observed. Further, colonic motility was measured using activated charcoal meal study. Proteins extracted from liver and intestine tissues were subjected to western blot technique. Paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues were sectioned for histochemical [Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue (AB) staining] analysis. Fecal microbiota analysis was performed using MOTHUR bioinformatic software.β-glucan consumption exhibited anti- property in mice groups fed with HFD. In addition, β-glucan ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic stress, colonic motility and intestinal atrophy (reduction in colon length, goblet cells, and mucosal layer thickness). Further, β-glucan incorporation shifted bacterial community by increasing butyrate-producing bacteria such as Anaerostipes, Coprobacillus, and Roseburia and decreasing reportedly -associated bacteria such as Parabacteroides and Lactococcus.Altogether, the outcomes of this present pre-clinical animal study show β-glucan to be a promising therapeutic candidate in the treatment of HFD-induced metabolic distress.

Plasma VitD levels were measured in the first (T1) and/or second trimester (T2). Multiple linear and logistic regression models were used for evaluating the association of VitD with GDM.Prepregnancy BMI was positively associated with all three time-point glucose of OGTT. 25(OH)D level in T1 (β = -0.003) and T2 (β = -0.004), and its change from T1 to T2 (β = -0.004) were significantly and inversely associated with fasting blood glucose (FBG) of OGTT, but not 1-h and 2-h postload blood glucose of OGTT, respectively. The negative associations of VitD and FBG were stronger among overweight/obese women. VitD deficiency (25(OH)D < 20 ng/ml) in T2 was associated with an increased risk of GDM with increased FBG, GDM subtype 1 (OR: 2.10) and subtype 3 (OR: 2.19). Moreover, prepregnancy BMI modified this effect on GDM subtype 1 (BMI < 24: OR = 1.42; BMI ≥ 24: OR = 9.61, P for interaction = 0.002). Lower VitD increment from T1 to T2 was associated with a higher risk for GDM among overweight/obese women. Additionally, GDM prevalence fluctuated with the season, i.e. lower in summer/fall and higher in winter/spring.Maternal VitD deficiency was associated with a higher risk of GDM subtype with increased FBG, and the risk is much greater among overweight/ women. The lower the VitD increment during pregnancy, the greater the risk of GDM, especially in overweight/ women. Furthermore, seasonal variation of GDM may be exhibited as a critical confounder in the association of VitD and GDM.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

It is unclear whether neighborhood walkability is a risk factor for future cardiovascular disease. Methods and Results We studied residents living in major urban centers in Ontario, Canada on January 1, 2008, using linked electronic medical record and administrative health data from the CANHEART (Cardiovascular Health in Ambulatory Care Research Team) cohort. Walkability was assessed using a validated index based on population and residential density, street connectivity, and the number of walkable destinations in each neighborhood, divided into quintiles (Q). The primary outcome was a predicted 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of ≥7.5% (recommended threshold for statin use) assessed by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Pooled Cohort Equation. Adjusted associations were estimated using logistic regression models. Secondary outcomes included measured systolic blood pressure, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, prior diabetes mellitus diagnosis, and current smoking status. In total, 44 448 individuals were included in our analyses. Fully adjusted analyses found a nonlinear relationship between walkability and predicted 10-year cardiovascular disease risk (least [Q1] versus most [Q5] walkable neighborhood: odds ratio =1.09, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.22), with the greatest difference between Q3 and Q5 (odds ratio=1.33, 95% CI: 1.23, 1.45). Dose-response associations were observed for systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and diabetes mellitus risk, while an inverse association was observed with smoking status. Conclusions In our setting, adults living in less walkable neighborhoods had a higher predicted 10-year cardiovascular disease risk than those living in highly walkable areas.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666078>Time-varying associations between prenatal metal mixtures and rapid visual processing in children.</a></h2><p>Humans are exposed to mixtures of chemicals across their lifetimes, a concept sometimes called the "exposome." Mixtures likely have temporal "critical windows" of susceptibility like single agents and measuring them repeatedly might help to define such windows. Common approaches to evaluate the effects of chemical mixtures have focused on their effects at a single time point. Our goal is to expand upon these previous techniques and examine the time-varying critical windows for metal mixtures on subsequent neurobehavior in children.We propose two methods, joint weighted quantile sum regression (JWQS) and meta-weighted quantile sum regression (MWQS), to estimate the effects of chemical mixtures measured across multiple time points, while providing data on their critical windows of exposure. We compare the performance of both methods using simulations. We also applied both techniques to assess second and third trimester metal mixture effects in predicting performance in the Rapid Visual Processing (RVP) task from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) assessed at 6-9 years in children who are part of the PROGRESS (Programming Research in , GRowth, Environment and Social Stressors) longitudinal cohort study. The metals, arsenic, cadmium (Cd), cesium, chromium, lead (Pb) and antimony (Sb) were selected based on their toxicological profile.In simulations, JWQS and MWQS had over 80% accuracy in classifying exposures as either strongly or weakly contributing to an association. In real data, both JWQS and MWQS consistently found that Pb and Cd exposure jointly predicted longer latency in the RVP and that second trimester exposure better predicted the results than the third trimester. Additionally, both JWQS and MWQS highlighted the strong association Cd and Sb had with lower accuracy in the RVP and that third trimester exposure was a better predictor than second trimester exposure.Our results indicate that metal mixtures effects vary across time, have distinct critical windows and that both JWQS and MWQS can determine longitudinal mixture effects including the cumulative contribution of each exposure and critical windows of effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664653>Learning Curves of Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy in Bariatric Surgery: a Systematic Review and Introduction of a Standardization.</a></h2><p>The most commonly performed bariatric procedures are laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Impact of learning curves on operative outcome has been well shown, but the necessary learning curves have not been clearly defined. This study provides a systematic review of the literature and proposes a standardization of phases of learning curves for RYGB and LSG.A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, and CENTRAL databases. All studies specifying a number or range of approaches to characterize the learning curve for RYGB and LSG were selected.A total of 28 publications related to learning curves for 27,770 performed bariatric surgeries were included. Parameters used to determine the learning curve were operative time, complications, conversions, length of stay, and blood loss. Learning curve range was 30-500 (RYGB) and 30-200 operations (LSG) according to different definitions and respective phases of learning curves. Learning phases described the number of procedures necessary to achieve predefined skill levels, such as competency, proficiency, and mastery.Definitions of learning curves for bariatric surgery are heterogeneous. Introduction of the three skill phases competency, proficiency, and mastery is proposed to provide a standardized definition using multiple outcome variables to enable better comparison in the future. These levels are reached after 30-70, 70-150, and up to 500 RYGB, and after 30-50, 60-100, and 100-200 LSG.

The prevalence of these risk factors differ by socioeconomic group in most populations, but this socially stratified distribution may depend on the social and cultural context. Little information on this topic is currently available in the Caribbean. The aim of this study was to describe the distribution of tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking and  by several socioeconomic determinants in the French West Indies (FWI).We used data from a cross-sectional health survey conducted in Guadeloupe and Martinique in 2014 in a representative sample of the population aged 15-75 years (n = 4054). All analyses were stratified by gender, and encompassed sample weights, calculated to account for the sampling design and correct for non-response. For each risk factor, we calculated weighted prevalence by income, educational level, occupational class and having hot water at home. Poisson regression models were used to estimate age-adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).Current smoking and harmful chronic alcohol use were more common in men than in women (PR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.55-2.09; PR = 4.53, 95% CI = 3.38-6.09 respectively). On the other hand, the prevalence of  was higher in women than in men (PR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.57-0.79). Higher education, higher occupational class and higher income were associated with lower prevalence of harmful alcohol drinking in men (PR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.25-0.72; PR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.53-1.01; PR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.51-1.03 respectively), but not in women. For tobacco smoking, no variation by socioeconomic status was observed in men whereas the prevalence of current smoking was higher among women with higher occupational class (PR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.13-1.91) and higher income (PR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.11-2.03). In women, a lower prevalence of  was associated with a higher income (PR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.33-0.56), a higher occupational class (PR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.50-0.80), a higher educational level (PR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.26-0.50) and having hot water at home (PR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.54-0.80).Women of high socio-economic status were significantly more likely to be smokers, whereas alcohol drinking in men and  in women were inversely associated with socioeconomic status.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670354>Whole barley prevents  and dyslipidemia without the involvement of the gut microbiota in germ free C57BL/6J obese mice.</a></h2><p>Whole barley (WB) consumption is the subject of renewed interest because of its health benefits. However, there are still controversies regarding the mechanisms of the anti- effects of WB. The gut microbiota has recently become a focus of research into -related disorders. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of the gut microbiota to the anti- effects of WB. Germ-free (GF) C57BL/6J mice underwent gastric inoculation with human feces to obtain human flora-associated (HFA) mice, and then both the GF and HFA mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) containing 46% WB or refined barley for 9 weeks. Features of  and dyslipidemia were compared between the GF and HFA mice and the cecal microbiota was analyzed using next-generation sequencing of microbial 16S rRNA. WB prevents  and hypercholesterolemia in the GF and HFA mice. The mechanism may include the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, because sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA) expression was downregulated, and a reduction in cholesterol accumulation, because cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) expression was upregulated, independent of the gut microbiota. Furthermore, WB intake enriched a variety of bacterial genera that are negatively associated with , including Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and Clostridium cluster XIVa, suggesting that WB counteracted gut dysbiosis in obese mice. Thus, WB helps prevent  and dyslipidemia via both gut microbiota-dependent and independent mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667614>Impact of age on morbidity and mortality following bariatric surgery.</a></h2><p>Bariatric surgery is the most effective modality to treat  and -related comorbidities. This study sought to utilize the MBASQIP® Data Registry to analyze the impact of age at time of surgery on outcomes following sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) procedures.The MBSAQIP® Data Registry for patients undergoing SG or RYGB procedures between 2015 and 2016 was reviewed. Patients were divided into 4 age groups [18-44; 45-54; 55-64; > 65 years]. Minimal exclusions for revisional and/or emergency surgery were selected and combination variables created to classify complications as major or minor. A comorbidity index was constructed to include diabetes, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and prior cardiac surgery. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to compare age stratifications to the young adult (18-45 years) cohort.Of 301,605 cases, 279,419 cases (71.2% SG) remained after applying exclusion criteria (79.2% female, mean BMI 45.5 ± 8.1 kg/m, 8.9% insulin-dependent diabetics). Mean age was 44.7 ± 12.0 years (51.3% 18-44 years; 26.9% 45-54 years; 16.3% 55-64 years; 5.5% > 65 years). A univariate analysis demonstrated preoperative differences of lower BMI with increasing age concomitant with increasing frequency of RYGB and a higher comorbidity index (p < 0.0001 vs. 18-45 years). At age > 45 years, major complications and 30-day mortality increased independent of procedure type (p < 0.0001). A multivariate analysis controlling for comorbidity indices demonstrated increasing age (> 45 years) increased risk for major complications and mortality.Overall, bariatric surgery (SG or RYGB) remains a low mortality risk procedure for all age groups. However, all age group classifications > 45 years had higher incidence of major complications and mortality compared to patients 18-45 years (despite older individuals having lower preoperative BMI) indicating delaying surgery is detrimental.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665163>Determinants of frailty development and progression using a multidimensional frailty index: Evidence from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing.</a></h2><p>To identify modifiable risk factors for development and progression of frailty in older adults living in England, as conceptualised by a multidimensional frailty index (FI).Data from participants aged 50 and over from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) was used to examine potential determinants of frailty, using a 56-item FI comprised of self-reported health conditions, disabilities, cognitive function, hearing, eyesight, depressive symptoms and ability to carry out activities of daily living. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to measure frailty development (n = 7420) and linear regression models to measure frailty progression over 12 years follow-up (n = 8780).Increasing age (HR: 1.08 (CI: 1.08-1.09)), being in the lowest wealth quintile (HR: 1.79 (CI: 1.54-2.08)), lack of educational qualifications (HR: 1.19 (CI: 1.09-1.30)),  (HR: 1.33 (CI: 1.18-1.50) and a high waist-hip ratio (HR: 1.25 (CI: 1.13-1.38)), being a current or previous smoker (HR: 1.29 (CI: 1.18-1.41)), pain (HR: 1.39 (CI: 1.34-1.45)), sedentary behaviour (HR: 2.17 (CI: 1.76-2.78) and lower body strength (HR: 1.07 (CI: 1.06-1.08)), were all significant risk factors for frailty progression and incidence after simultaneous adjustment for all examined factors.The findings of this study suggest that there may be scope to reduce both frailty incidence and progression by trialling interventions aimed at reducing  and sedentary behaviour, increasing intensity of physical activity, and improving success of smoking cessation tools. Furthermore, improving educational outcomes and reducing poverty may also reduce inequalities in frailty.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672147>Luseogliflozin attenuates neointimal hyperplasia after wire injury in high-fat diet-fed mice via inhibition of perivascular adipose tissue remodeling.</a></h2><p>Excess fat deposition could induce phenotypic changes of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT remodeling), which may promote the progression of atherosclerosis via modulation of adipocytokine secretion. However, it remains unclear whether and how suppression of PVAT remodeling could attenuate vascular injury. In this study, we examined the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, luseogliflozin on PVAT remodeling and neointima formation after wire injury in mice.Wilt-type mice fed with low-fat diet (LFD) or high-fat diet (HFD) received oral administration of luseogliflozin (18 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. Mice underwent bilateral femoral artery wire injury followed by unilateral removal of surrounding PVAT. After 25 days, injured femoral arteries and surrounding PVAT were analyzed.In LFD-fed lean mice, neither luseogliflozin treatment or PVAT removal attenuated the intima-to-media (I/M) ratio of injured arteries. However, in HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin or PVAT removal reduced the I/M ratio, whereas their combination showed no additive reduction. In PVAT surrounding injured femoral arteries of HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin treatment decreased the adipocyte sizes. Furthermore, luseogliflozin reduced accumulation of macrophages expressing platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) and increased adiponectin gene expression. Gene expression levels of Pdgf-b in PVAT were correlated with the I/M ratio.Our present study suggests that luseogliflozin could attenuate neointimal hyperplasia after wire injury in HFD-fed mice partly via suppression of macrophage PDGF-B expression in PVAT. Inhibition of PVAT remodeling by luseogliflozin may be a novel therapeutic target for vascular remodeling after angioplasty.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673265>The Incidence of  in the Combination of Allergic Rhinitis and Diabetes Mellitus.</a></h2><p> mites are permanent ectoparasites of human pilosebaceous unit. They mainly infect skin of the face and scalp. Many studies have shown higher density of the ectoparasites in diseased inflammatory skin than in normal skin. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of  (DF) in treatment-resistant patients with the combination of allergic rhinitis (AR) and diabetes mellitus (DM).This study was conducted in 2014-2017. It included 92 patients aged 18-70 years who presented at the Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) and Endocrinology Polyclinics of Mustafa Kemal University Medical Faculty Hospital, Turkey. An age and gender matched control group was formed of 30 healthy individuals. To determine the presence of DF, a few eyelashes were taken from eyelids in both groups. Then samples were examined under a light microscope.DF positivity was determined in 44 (47.8%) of the 92 patients and in 1 (3.3%) of the 30 control group subjects. In the patient group, DF positivity was evaluated as present in 14 (43.7%) of the DM patients, in 12 (40%) of the AR patients and in 18 (60%) of the AR+DM patients. Statistically significant DF incidence was found in all three patient groups compared to the control group (=0.001). The incidence in AR + DM group was not different from other patient groups.DM, AR, advanced age and  had prepared the environment for  infestations. This issue should be considered especially in treatment of patients with AR+DM.Copyright© Iranian Society of Parasitology & Tehran University of Medical Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672146>Short-term treatment with high dose liraglutide improves lipid and lipoprotein profile and changes hormonal mediators of lipid metabolism in obese patients with no overt type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind clinical trial.</a></h2><p>Long-term treatment with up to 1.8 mg liraglutide improves cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is currently under investigation in subjects without diabetes. Aim of our study was to investigate whether high dose (3 mg) short-term (5 weeks) treatment with liraglutide in obese patients with no overt type 2 diabetes affects metabolites, lipid and lipoprotein profile and components of activin-follistatin axis in cardiovascular beneficial or detrimental way.Twenty obese patients participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind study and were administrated liraglutide 3 mg or placebo for 5 weeks. Metabolites, fatty acids, lipid-lipoprotein profile and concentrations of activins and follistatins (250 parameters) were assessed in serum at start and completion of each treatment.Concentrations of important cardiovascular markers such as total, free and remnant cholesterol were reduced with liraglutide before and after adjusting for weight loss. Similarly, reductions in number of small and medium size LDL particles and in their total lipid concentration were observed with liraglutide and partially weight-loss related. Tyrosine levels were reduced and behenic acid levels were increased whereas only minor changes were observed in HDL, VLDL and IDL. Concentrations of activin AB and follistatin were significantly reduced in liraglutide-treated group.Treatment of obese patients without overt type 2 diabetes with high dose of liraglutide for a short period of time induces changes in lipid-lipoprotein and hormonal profile that are suggestive of lower risk of atherosclerosis and CVD.

During this time, adult  grew by 5%.This study aimed to evaluate the demand and associated costs for hospital-based back surgery by geolocation over time to evaluate provider practice variation. The study then leveraged hierarchical time series to generate tight demand forecasts on an unobserved test set. Finally, explanatory financial, technical, workload, geographical, and temporal factors as well as state-level  rates were investigated as predictors for the demand for hospital-based back surgery.Hospital data from January 2012 to December 2017 were used to generate geospatial-temporal maps and a video of the Current Procedural Terminology codes beginning with the digit 63 claims. Hierarchical time series modeling provided forecasts for each state, the census regions, and the nation for an unobserved test set and then again for the out-years of 2018 and 2019. Stepwise regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, elastic net, and gradient-boosted random forests were built on a training set and evaluated on a test set to evaluate variables important to explaining the demand for hospital-based back surgery.Widespread, unexplained practice variation over time was seen using geographical information systems (GIS) multimedia mapping. Hierarchical time series provided accurate forecasts on a blind dataset and suggested a 6.52% (from 497,325 procedures in 2017 to 529,777 in 2018) growth of hospital-based back surgery in 2018 (529,777 and up to 13.00% by 2019 [from 497,325 procedures in 2017 to 563,023 procedures in 2019]). The increase in payments by 2019 are estimated to be US $323.9 million. Extreme gradient-boosted random forests beat constrained and unconstrained regression models on a 20% unobserved test set and suggested that  is one of the most important factors in explaining the increase in demand for hospital-based back surgery.Practice variation and  are factors to consider when estimating demand for hospital-based back surgery. Federal, state, and local planners should evaluate demand-side and supply-side interventions for this emerging problem.©Lawrence Fulton, Clemens Scott Kruse.
