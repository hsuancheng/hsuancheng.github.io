The present study explored if polymorphisms in genes encoding proteins in  could be used as predictors for the individual response to antihypertensive treatment.Ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in genes related to  were analysed by a microarray based minisequencing system in DNA samples from ninety-seven hypertensive subjects randomised to treatment with either 150 mg of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker  or 50 mg of the beta1-adrenergic receptor blocker atenolol for twelve weeks.The reduction in blood pressure was similar in both treatment groups. The SNP C711T in the apolipoprotein B gene was associated with the blood pressure response to  with an average reduction of 19 mmHg in the individuals carrying the C-allele, but not to atenolol. The C16730T polymorphism in the low density lipoprotein receptor gene predicted the change in systolic blood pressure in the atenolol group with an average reduction of 14 mmHg in the individuals carrying the C-allele.Polymorphisms in genes encoding proteins in the  are associated with the response to antihypertensive treatment in a drug specific pattern. These results highlight the potential use of pharmacogenetics as a guide for individualised antihypertensive treatment, and also the role of lipids in blood pressure control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27919004> ameliorates hyperlipidemia and liver steatosis in type 2 diabetic db/db mice via stimulating PPAR-γ, AMPK/Akt/mTOR signaling and autophagy.</a></h2><p> (Irb), a unique subset of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) with PPAR-γ activation function, has been reported to play a role in renal dysfunction, glucose , and abnormal  profile in diabetic animal models and humans. However, the underlying mechanisms that improve hyperlipidemia and liver steatosis are unclear. This study investigated the effects of Irb on  and hepatic steatosis using the spontaneous type 2 diabetic db/db mouse model. The results demonstrated body and liver weight, food consumption,  content in serum and liver tissue, and liver dysfunction as well as hepatic steatosis were increased in db/db mice compared with db/m mice, whereas the increases were reversed by Irb treatment. Moreover, Irb administration resulted in an increase in LC3BII as well as the LC3BII/I ratio through activating PPAR-γ and p-AMPK and inhibiting p-Akt and p-mTOR, thereby inducing autophagy in the db/db mouse liver. Therefore, our findings suggest that Irb can ameliorate hyperlipidemia and liver steatosis by upregulating the expression of PPAR-γ, activating the AMPK/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and inducing liver autophagy.Copyright © 2016.

The angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) losartan is known to decrease serum uric acid (UA) level. A recent in vitro study demonstrated a strong interaction between  and UA transporters that exceeded that of losartan. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the hypouricemic effect of  in a clinical setting. A total of 40 high-risk hypertensive outpatients with coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease and/or diabetes complications who were taking ARBs other than  and losartan were enrolled in this study. After a 4-week control period, the patients' prescribed ARBs were exchanged for an equivalent dose of . We assessed blood pressure, heart rate, serum UA level, parameters of lipid and glucose , cardiac and renal function and inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in blood samples taken immediately before the initiation of  treatment and again after 12 weeks of treatment. All 40 recruited patients were followed (31 men and 9 women, mean age: 68 years) without any dropouts. During the 12 weeks of  treatment, no significant changes in blood pressure, heart rate, parameters of lipid or glucose  or other biomarkers of cardiac function, renal function, or inflammation were observed. However, UA level (5.9±1.6 to 5.5±1.6 mg ml(-1), P=0.028) and the oxidative stress marker derivative reactive oxygen metabolites (dROMs) (354±83 to 310±65 U.CARR, P<0.001) were significantly lower at 12 weeks of treatment compared with before treatment.

The activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and lipid disorders are major risk factors in progressive chronic kidney disease. Inhibition of the RAS is one of the most widely used therapies to treat chronic kidney disease. But its effect is not sufficient, and lowered hyperlipidemia is required. Most of medications for hypertension have effects only on the blood pressure in DN. This study is to evaluate the influence of  on blood lipid, kidney function, and the pathological change of kidney, liver, and adipose tissue.Six-week old db/db mice were randomly assigned to control group and  group. Mice in  group were fed 40 mg/kg  each day. Eight weeks later, blood lipid, kidney function, and the pathological change of kidney, liver, and adipose tissue were measured.The results indicated that the blood lipid, uric acid, urea nitrogen, and creatinine of db/db mice increased significantly. There are obvious vacuolar degeneration and ballooned hepatocytes around the central vein of db/db mouse liver. Kidney biopsy found glomerular hypertrophy of glomerular, mesangial thickening, and vacuolar degeneration.  can decrease the blood pressure, blood lipid, and kidney lipid.

Kidneys were processed for light microscopy (LM) and immunohistochemistry, including antibodies against interstitial alpha-smooth-muscle-actin (alpha-SMA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), transforming growth factor-beta(1)(TGF-beta 1), and collagen (COL) I, III, and IV.All treated groups presented similar reduction in blood pressure compared with untreated OZR. However, animals from G4 (B + I) showed better control on proteinuria together with a higher creatinine clearance. Additionally, G4 showed a significant (P < 0.05) lower kidney weight; smaller glomerular area; lower glomerulosclerosis score; lower percentage of tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and interstitial alpha-SMA; lower tubular PAI-1 score; lower percentage of COL I, III, and IV in renal interstitium; and lower wall/lumen ratio in renal vessels, when compared with the other groups. OZR treated with B and/or I showed a better outcome (P < 0.01) in the carbohydrate and  in comparison with untreated OZR.These results suggest that combined therapy using B and I is more effective than therapy with either drug at monotherapy for controlling renal damage in this animal model.

The study took place in Ege University Hospital, Bornova-Izmir, Turkey, between January 2005 and April 2005. Patients were treated with  300mg/day for 3 months. Physical examination, medical history, systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels, microalbuminuria, diabetes markers fasting and non-fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c],  profile, creatinine and urea were obtained at baseline and after 3 months of  treatment. The primary assessment criterion was the change in microalbuminuria.The mean microalbuminuria level at baseline was 110.8+/-93.1mg/24 hours. It significantly decreased to 45.6+/-62.5mg/24 hours at the end of 3 months of  treatment (p<0.001). When patients were stratified according to the change in the microalbuminuria status after treatment, 90% of them either returned to normo albuminuria or their microalbuminuria decreased. Both diastolic and systolic blood pressures, fasting and non-fasting blood glucose, and HbA1c were found to be significantly decreased after 3 months of  treatment compared to pre-treatment values. The positive effect of  on microalbuminuria occurs independently from HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, and blood pressures.The short-term treatment of  is effective to decrease microalbuminuria in normotensive type 2 diabetes patients, independent of its antihypertensive effect.

We investigated whether the phosphate binder sevelamer carbonate may enhance the antiproteinuric effect of RAS inhibitors in patients with CKD.Phase 2, randomized, controlled, open-label, crossover trial.Between November 2013 and December 2014, we enrolled 53 patients with CKD with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs)>15mL/min/1.73m and residual proteinuria with protein excretion≥0.5g/24h despite maximal tolerated ramipril and/or  therapy from 2 nephrology units in Italy.After stratification by serum phosphate level, ≤4 or>4mg/dL, patients were randomly assigned to 3 months of sevelamer (1,600mg thrice daily) treatment followed by 3 months without sevelamer separated by a 1-month washout period or 3 months without sevelamer followed by 3 months with sevelamer, also separated by a 1-month washout period.The primary outcome was 24-hour proteinuria (n=49patients). Secondary outcomes included measured GFR (using iohexol plasma clearance), office blood pressure (BP), serum  levels, levels of inflammation and bone  biomarkers, urinary electrolyte levels, and arterial stiffness.Changes in proteinuria during the 3-month treatment with (from 1.36 [IQR, 0.77-2.51] to 1.36 [IQR, 0.77-2.60] g/24h) or without (from 1.36 [IQR, 0.99-2.38] to 1.48 [IQR, 0.81-2.77] g/24h) sevelamer were similar (P=0.1). Sevelamer reduced urinary phosphate excretion without affecting serum phosphate levels. Sevelamer reduced C-reactive protein (CRP), glycated hemoglobin, and total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels without affecting levels of office BP, measured GFR, fibroblast growth factor 23, klotho, intact parathyroid hormone, serum vitamin D, or other urinary electrolytes. Results were similar in the low- and high-phosphate groups. Sevelamer was well tolerated. Adverse events were comparable between treatment periods. One case of transient hypophosphatemia was observed during treatment with sevelamer.Short treatment duration, lower pretreatment proteinuria than expected.3-month sevelamer treatment did not reduce proteinuria in patients with CKD on maximal RAS blockade.

Elucidation of the role of 5- lipooxygenase/leukotriene pathway and renin angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of MetS suggests a variety of potential therapies worthy of testing. The present work investigated the effect of montelukast, a leukotriene antagonist and/or , an angiotensin II-receptor blocker, in the prevention of fructose-induced MetS in rats. Rats were allocated into 9 groups and treated for 6 weeks as follow: normal control; MetS group (received 20% fructose); MetS+montelukast groups (treated with montelukast, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg/day, respectively); MetS+ groups (treated withirbesartan 15, 30, and 45 mg/kg/day, respectively); and MetS+montelukast+ group (co treated with montelukast 5 mg/kg plus  15 mg/g).  parameters (visceral fat index, liver index, insulin resistance, and serum lipid profile), oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, and catalase), and inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor-α, and uric acid) were measured. Expression of caspase-3 in hepatic tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry. Liver injury was evaluated by histopathological examination and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Montelukast, , and their combination caused significant attenuation in  and hepatic disorders. Their effect was associated with attenuation of oxidative stress markers, inflammatory mediators, and caspase-3 expression. This study highlighted the protective effects of montelukast and  against fructose-induced  and hepatic disorders. The protective effect of either drug relies, at least in part, on their antioxidant and antiinflammatory effect, as well as on the reduction of caspase-3 expression in hepatic tissue.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Our previous research found that carnosic acid (CA) or rosemary extract can effectively improve glucose and  disorder by inhibiting SREBPs.In this study, we aimed to explore the therapeutic effects of CA on the DN.The mice glomerular mesangial cells (mGMCs) were used to evaluate the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammation effects of CA under high glucose (HG) condition. Furthermore, db/db mice and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice were used to investigate the effects of CA against DN in vivo.The results showed that CA activated Nrf2, inhibited NF-κB pathway and regulated related downstream genes in mGMC under HG condition. A 14-week treatment of mice with CA reduced water uptake and urine volume, attenuated diabetes-induced albuminuria, increased urine creatinine, and subsequently improved the glomerular sclerosis and mesangial expansion in db/db mice. Similarly, a 20-week oral administration of CA improved kidney damage in STZ-induced diabetic mice. In addition, CA inhibited the expression of profibrotic factors, such as TGF-β1, fibronectin and E-cadherin. Compared to , CA exerted better glucose lowering effect, and in kidney, CA was more potent to reduce fibronectin and E-cadherin expression. In all the animal experiment, CA did not lead to abnormal damages to other tissues.These findings suggest that CA is a safe compound which exerts the protective effects on diabetes-induced kidney complications.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

These drugs may also improve glucose tolerance, but the mechanism for this remains elusive. We now studied whether these drugs and the fatty acid palmitate influence insulin secretion in vivo in rats through effects on islet blood perfusion. Whole pancreatic blood flow was markedly increased by captopril and , and decreased by palmitate. Islet blood flow was significantly and preferentially enhanced by captopril, , and pravastatin, and suppressed by palmitate. Both captopril and  raised serum insulin concentrations significantly. However, glycemia was not affected in any group. In conclusion, the present study suggests that a local pancreatic RAS and pravastatin may be selectively controlling pancreatic islet blood flow and thereby influencing insulin secretion. The antidiabetic actions of statins and RAS inhibitors might in part occur through the beneficial direct islet effects shown here. Conversely, free fatty acids that are elevated in type 2 diabetic patients may contribute to an impaired nutritive islet blood flow and thereby further aggravate the diabetic state by limiting the supply of insulin needed to curb hyperglycemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25617729> ameliorates diabetic cardiomyopathy by regulating protein kinase D and ER stress activation in a type 2 diabetes rat model.</a></h2><p>Recent studies demonstrate an important role of protein kinase D (PKD) in the cardiovascular system.

Diabetic rats revealed severe  abnormalities, left ventricular dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis and apoptosis. PKD and ER stress were excessive activated in the myocardium of diabetic rats. Furthermore, cardiac fibrosis, apoptosis, diastolic dysfunction and ER stress were all significantly related to PKD activation in diabetic rats.  treatment attenuated the activation of PKD and ER stress, which paralleled its cardioprotective effects. Our study suggests that  could ameliorate cardiac remodeling and dysfunction in type 2 diabetes, and these beneficial effects were associated with its ability to suppress the activation of PKD and ER stress.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It is a marker and predictor of cardiovascular disease. CRP possesses numerous cardiovascular effects (clotting, generation of oxygen radicals, increase in the expression of adhesion molecules and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, plaque destabilization) that could result in cardiovascular disease. This review describes the effects of various cardiovascular drugs on the levels of CRP in health and disease. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors (aspirin, rofecoxib, celecoxib), platelet aggregation inhibitors (clopidogrel, abciximab),  lowering agents (statins, ezetimibe, fenofibrate, niacin, diets), beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists and antioxidants (vitamin E), as well as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ramipril, captopril, fosinopril), reduce serum levels of CRP; while enalapril and trandolapril have not been shown to have the same effect. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (valsartan, , olmesartan, telmisartan) markedly reduce serum levels of CRP. The findings with other ARBs (losartan and candesartan) were inconsistent. Antidiabetic agents (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) reduce CRP levels, while insulin is ineffective. Calcium channel antagonists have variable effects on CRP levels. Hydrochlorothiazide and oral estrogen do not affect CRP. The CRP-lowering effect of statins is more pronounced than their  lowering effect and is not dependent on their hypolipemic activity. The effect of atorvastatin on CRP seems to be dose-dependent. CRP-lowering effect of statins is likely to contribute to the favorable outcome of statin therapy. The data suggest that  lowering agents, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, antidiabetic agents, antiinflammatory and antiplatelet agents, vitamin E, and beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists lower serum or plasma levels of CRP, while vitamin C, oral estrogen and hydrochlorothiazide do not affect CRP levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15007034>Identification of telmisartan as a unique angiotensin II receptor antagonist with selective PPARgamma-modulating activity.</a></h2><p>The metabolic syndrome is a common precursor of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes that is characterized by the clustering of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and increased blood pressure. In humans, mutations in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) have been reported to cause the full-blown metabolic syndrome, and drugs that activate PPARgamma have proven to be effective agents for the prevention and treatment of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Here we report that telmisartan, a structurally unique angiotensin II receptor antagonist used for the treatment of hypertension, can function as a partial agonist of PPARgamma; influence the expression of PPARgamma target genes involved in carbohydrate and ; and reduce glucose, insulin, and triglyceride levels in rats fed a high-, high-carbohydrate diet. None of the other commercially available angiotensin II receptor antagonists appeared to activate PPARgamma when tested at concentrations typically achieved in plasma with conventional oral dosing. In contrast to ordinary antihypertensive and antidiabetic agents, molecules that can simultaneously block the angiotensin II receptor and activate PPARgamma have the potential to treat both hemodynamic and biochemical features of the metabolic syndrome and could provide unique opportunities for the prevention and treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in high-risk populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15867169>Effect of atorvastatin and , alone and in combination, on postprandial endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation in type 2 diabetic patients.</a></h2><p>Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia are considered risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Evidence suggests that postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia induce endothelial dysfunction and inflammation through oxidative stress. Statins and angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers have been shown to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, improving endothelial function.Twenty type 2 diabetic patients ate 3 different test meals: a high- meal, 75 g glucose alone, and a high- meal plus glucose. Glycemia, triglyceridemia, endothelial function, nitrotyrosine, C-reactive protein, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and interleukin-6 were assayed during the tests. Subsequently, diabetics took atorvastatin 40 mg/d,  300 mg/d, both, or placebo for 1 week. The 3 tests were performed again between 5 and 7 days after the start of each treatment. High- load and glucose alone produced a decrease in endothelial function and increases in nitrotyrosine, C-reactive protein, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and interleukin-6. These effects were more pronounced when high- load and glucose were combined. Short-term atorvastatin and  treatments significantly counterbalanced these phenomena, and their combination was more effective than either therapy alone.This study confirms an independent and cumulative effect of postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia on endothelial function and inflammation, suggesting oxidative stress as a common mediator of such an effect. Short-term treatment with atorvastatin and  may counterbalance this phenomenon; the combination of the 2 compounds is most effective.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21061834>Effects of olmesartan vs  on metabolic parameters and visfatin in hypertensive obese women.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin II regulates the production of adipokines.

Molecular mechanisms underlying their formation and signaling are unclear. We investigated the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS), Rho kinase, and  rafts in microparticle formation and examined their functional significance in endothelial cells (ECs).Microparticle formation from angiotensin II (Ang II)-stimulated ECs and apolipoprotein E(-/-) mice was assessed by annexin V or by CD144 staining and electron microscopy. Ang II promoted microparticle formation and increased EC O(2)(-) generation and Rho kinase activity. Ang II-stimulated effects were inhibited by  (Ang II receptor type I blocker) and fasudil (Rho kinase inhibitor). Methyl-β-cyclodextrin and nystatin, which disrupt  rafts/caveolae, blocked microparticle release. Functional responses, assessed in microparticle-stimulated ECs, revealed increased O(2)(-) production, enhanced vascular cell adhesion molecule/platelet-EC adhesion molecule expression, and augmented macrophage adhesion. Inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor blocked the prooxidative and proinflammatory effects of microparticles. In vitro observations were confirmed in apolipoprotein E(-/-) mice, which displayed vascular inflammation and high levels of circulating endothelial microparticles, effects that were reduced by apocynin.We demonstrated direct actions of Ang II on endothelial microparticle release, mediated through NADPH oxidase, ROS, and Rho kinase targeted to  rafts.

Evidence indicate that the angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers can suppress atherogenesis, but the exact mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. The study was undertaken to investigate the potential effects and molecular mechanisms of an angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker  on atherogenesis in high cholesterol-diet apolipoprotein E knock-out mice.Adult male apolipoprotein E knock-out mice were given normal diet or high cholesterol-diet and randomized to receive no treatment or  10 mg kg(-1) d(-1) for 12 weeks. The apolipoprotein E knock-out mice with high cholesterol-diet were associated with a marked increase in atherosclerotic lesion area, plasma  and angiotensin II levels, as well as the expressions of angiotensin type 1 receptor in the aorta. High cholesterol-diet feeding increases the activity of NADPH oxidase subunits (p47(phox) and Rac), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, janus kinase 2, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, nuclear factor-kappaB and the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 6, monocyte chemoattactant protein-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in the aortas. These changes were suppressed in mice that were treated with  10 mg kg(-1) d(-1), with no significant change in systolic blood pressure and plasma  levels.The results suggest that  can attenuate atherosclerosis, and this effect is partly related to the inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammatory signal transduction pathways which eventually leads to the decrease in the expression of inflammatory cytokines.Copyright  2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However currently clinical laboratory and histopathological tests do not provide region-specific and accurate biomarkers for early detection of kidney disease. The present study was conducted to identify sensitive biomarkers for early detection and progression of tubulo-interstitial nephropathy in aristolochic acid I-induced rats at weeks 4, 8 and 12. Biomarkers were validated using aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) rats at week 24, adenine-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD) rats and CKD patients. Compared with control rats, AAN rats showed anemia, increased serum urea and creatinine, progressive renal interstitial fibrosis, activation of nuclear factor-kappa B, and up-regulation of pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidant, and pro-fibrotic proteins at weeks 8 and 12. However, no significant difference was found at week 4. Metabolomics identified 12-ketodeoxycholic acid, taurochenodesoxycholic acid, LPC(15:0) and docosahexaenoic acid as biomarkers for early detection of tubulo-interstitial nephropathy. With prolonging aristolochic acid I exposure, LPE(20:2), cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid and LPC(17:0) were identified as biomarkers for progression from early to advanced AAN and lysoPE(22:5), indoxyl sulfate, uric acid and creatinine as biomarkers of advanced AAN. These biomarkers were reversed by treatment of  and ergone in AAN rats at week 24 and adenine-induced CKD rats. In addition, these biomarkers were also reversed by  treatment in CKD patients.Copyright © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Recent clinical trials have shown the added benefits of ARBs in hypertensive patients (reduction in left ventricular hypertrophy, improvement in diastolic function, decrease in ventricular arrhythmias, reduction in microalbuminuria, and improvement in renal function), and cardioprotective effect in patients with heart failure. Several large long-term studies are in progress to assess the beneficial effects of ARBs on cardiac hypertrophy, renal function, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients with or without diabetes mellitus, and the value of these drugs in patients with heart disease and diabetic nephropathy. The ARBs specifically block the interaction of angiotensin II at the AT1 receptor, thereby relaxing smooth muscle, increasing salt and water excretion, reducing plasma volume, and decreasing cellular hypertrophy. These agents exert their blood pressure-lowering effect mainly by reducing peripheral vascular resistance usually without a rise in heart rate. Most of the commercially available ARBs control blood pressure for 24 h after once daily dosing. Sustained efficacy of blood pressure control, without any evidence of tachyphylaxis, has been demonstrated after long-term administration (3 years) of some of the ARBs. The efficacy of ARBs is similar to that of thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium channel blockers in patients with similar degree of hypertension. Higher daily doses, dietary salt restriction, and concomitant diuretic or ACE inhibitor administration amplify the antihypertensive effect of ARBs. The ARBs have a low incidence of adverse effects (headache, upper respiratory infection, back pain, muscle cramps, fatigue and dizziness), even in the elderly patients. After the approval of losartan, five other ARBs (candesartan cilexetil, eprosartan, , telmisartan, and valsartan) and three combinations with hydrochlorothiazide (, losartan and valsartan) have been approved as antihypertensive agents, and some 28 compounds are in various stages of development. The ARBs are non-peptide compounds with varied structures; some (candesartan, losartan, , and valsartan) have a common tetrazolo-biphenyl structure. Except for , all active ARBs have a carboxylic acid group. Candesartan cilexetil is a prodrug, while losartan has a metabolite (EXP3174) which is more active than the parent drug. No other metabolites of ARBs contribute significantly to the antihypertensive effect. The variation in the molecular structure of the ARBs results in differences in the binding affinity to the receptor and pharmacokinetic profiles. The differences observed in  solubility, absorption/distribution, plasma protein binding, bioavailability, biotransformation, plasma half-life, and systemic elimination influence the time of onset, duration of action, and efficacy of the ARBs. On the basis of the daily mg dose, the antihypertensive potency of the ARBs follows the sequence: candesartan cilexetil > telmisartan approximately = losartan >  approximately = valsartan > eprosartan. After oral administration, the ARBs are rapidly absorbed (time for peak plasma levels = 0.5-4 h) but they have a wide range of bioavailability (from a low of 13% for eprosartan to a high of 60-80% for ); food does not influence the bioavailability, except for valsartan (a reduction of 40-50%) and eprosartan (increase). A limited dose-peak plasma levels/areas under the plasma level-time curve proportionality is observed for some of the ARBs. Most of these drugs have high plasma protein binding (95-100%);  has the lowest binding among the group (90%). The steady-state volumes of distribution vary from a low of 9 L (candesartan) to a high of 500 L (telmisartan).

In this study, the authors investigated the influence of , an angiotensin receptor blocker, on the phenotypic alterations of podocytes in experimental DN.DN was induced by combination of high-sucrose, high- diet and intraperitoneal injection of low dose of streptozotocin (35 mg/kg) in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Diabetic rats were treated with  (50 mg/kg/d) by gavage for 8 weeks. Nondiabetic normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats, which have the same genetic background as spontaneously hypertensive rat, were used as controls. The renal histological changes were investigated by light and electron microscopy. The epithelial marker of nephrin and mesenchymal marker of desmin were detected by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting.Compared with controls, diabetic rats were associated with mesangial matrix deposition, thickening of glomerular basement membrane, albuminuria, loss of podocytes and effacement of foot processes. Furthermore, the expression of nephrin was significantly reduced whereas desmin was increased.  treatment not only lowered blood pressure and albuminuria but also attenuated podocyte loss, maintenance of nephrin expression and inhibition of desmin expression.This study demonstrates that early  intervention attenuates the podocyte damage and ameliorates phenotypic alterations of podocytes, which provides a novel insight for the early application of angiotensin receptor blocker to prevent the development of DN.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22977605> improves endothelial dysfunction, abnormal  profile, proteinuria and liver dysfunction in Zucker diabetic fatty rats independent of glucose and insulin levels.</a></h2><p>Treatment with angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) is known to improve renal dysfunction and glucose  in obese diabetic animal models and humans. This study examined the effects of , a unique ARB with PPARγ activation, on endothelial dysfunction, renal dysfunction, abnormal  profile, and liver dysfunction in obese fa/fa Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. ZDF rats were administered  (30 mg/kg/day p.o.) for 12 weeks. Blood pressure, glucose ,  profile and renal function were measured every 4 weeks. Response of mesenteric artery rings to acetylcholine was also evaluated as an index of endothelial function after 12 weeks of treatment. Although  did not affect glucose and insulin levels in both glucose and insulin tolerance tests, decreases in systolic blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and urinary protein excretion were noted from 4 weeks after the start of treatment and continued until 12 weeks. Endothelial and liver dysfunctions were also improved after 12 weeks of treatment. Compared to previous reports showing the effects of  at later time points such as 6 or 12 months, the present study demonstrated that a low-dose of  had favorable effects from the early period of treatment, independent of glucose .

Telmisartan prevents weight gain and decreases food intake in models of obesity and in glitazone-treated rodents. This study further investigates the influence of telmisartan and pioglitazone and their association on weight gain and body composition by examining their influence on neuroendocrine mediators involved in food intake. Male C57/Black 6 mice were fed a high- diet, weight matched, and randomized in 4 treatment groups: vehicle, pioglitazone, telmisartan, and pioglitazone-telmisartan. Weight gain, food and water intake, body composition, plasma leptin levels, and the hypothalamic expression of neuroendocrine mediators were analyzed. Additional studies were performed with  and in angiotensin II 1(A) receptor-knockout mice. Telmisartan abolished weight and  gain in vehicle- and pioglitazone-treated mice while decreasing food intake, the hypothalamic expression of the agouti-related protein, and plasma leptin levels. Modifications in neuropeptide Y and proopiomelanocortin were not consistent with changes in food intake. The effects on weight gain and expression of the agouti-related protein were intermediate with . The effects of telmisartan on weight gain were even more pronounced in angiotensin II 1(A) receptor-knockout mice. This study confirms the anorexigenic effects of telmisartan in mice fed a high- diet and suggests for the first time a functional role of telmisartan on hypothalamic orexigenic agouti-related protein regulation. These anorexigenic properties abolish both weight gain and body composition modifications in -fed and glitazone-treated mice. The anorexigenic properties are independent from the angiotensin II 1(A) receptor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25046956>[Effect of Chinese herbs for stasis removing and collaterals dredging upon angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-angiotensin-(1-7)-mas axis in the renal cortex of diabetic nephropathy rats].</a></h2><p>To observe the effect of Chinese herbs for stasis removing and collaterals dredging (CHSRCD) upon angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-angiotensin-(1-7)-Mas axis in the renal cortex of diabetic nephropathy rats.Totally 89 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the blank control group (C group, n=22), the high-glucose high-fat control group (H group, n=10), and the streptozotocin (STZ)-injecting group (n=57). The diabetes rat model (n=50) was induced by feeding high-glucose high-fat diet in combination with intraperitoneal injection of STZ, which were further divided into the model group (M group, n=24), the  group (I group, n=13), and the CHSRCD (Z group, n=13). Rats in I and Z groups were intragastrically fed with suspension of  and CHSRCD, once daily for 16 weeks. Equal volume of drinking water was administrated to rats in the rest groups. Blood glucose and 24 h urine protein quantitation were tested at four time points. And the mRNA expression of ACE2 and Mas at various time points was detected by Real-time PCR, immunohistochemical assay, and Western blot. Quantitative analyses of ACE2 and Mas protein expression were performed at the end of week 16.Compared with the C group, blood glucose increased in the H and M groups (P < 0.01). It was higher in the H group (P < 0. 01). 24 h urine protein quantitation at different time points increased in the M group, and it was higher than that in the H group (P < 0.05). Compared with the M group, 24 h urine protein quantitation decreased at the end of week 8 in the I group, and at the end of week 8 and 16 in the Z group (P < 0.05). It was lower in the Z group than in the I group at the end of week 16 (P < 0.05). Compared with the C and H groups, the expression of ACE2 mRNA in the renal cortex was lower in the M group at the end of week 16 (P < 0.01). Compared with the M group, it was higher in the Z group (P < 0. 01). There was no statistical difference in the expressions of Mas mRNA at the end of week 16 between the C group and the M group (P > 0.05). It was lower in the M group than in the H group (P < 0.05). It was higher in the Z group than in the M group (P < 0.05), and higher than in the I group (P < 0.05). The expression of ACE2 and Mas protein in the M group decreased as time went by. The expression quantitation of ACE2 and Mas protein at the end of week 16 was lower in the M group than in the C group (P < 0.05). Compared with the M group, ACE2 expression of the Z group and Mas of the I and Z groups increased more significantly (P < 0. 05).CHSRCD could play a role in renal protection for diabetic nephropathy rats by up-regulating the mRNA and protein expression of ACE2 and Mas, promoting the ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis, and lowering urinary protein.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25918729>Renal kallikrein activation and renoprotection after dual blockade of renin-angiotensin system in diet-induced diabetic nephropathy.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of dual blockage of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on renal kallikrein expression and inflammatory response in diabetic nephropathy (DN).Rats were randomly divided into 5 groups with 10 rats in each group: normal control; DN model induced by high fat and high sucrose diets; and DN treated with either benazepril 10 mg/kg/d,  30 mg/kg/d, or both. After 8-week treatment, we examined changes in the kidney histopathology, function and immunohistochemical stain of kallikrein, macrophage marker CD68, and profibrotic markers transforming growth factor- (TGF-) β and α-smooth muscle action (SMA).DN rats showed enlarged kidneys with glomerulosclerosis, interstitial chronic inflammation and fibrosis, and proteinuria.

The aim of this work was to validate that observation in human cells and humans.We investigated the induction of in-vitro adipogenesis and the activation of PPARgamma-target genes, adiponectin and lipoprotein lipase, by ARB in human preadipocytes. We also studied PPARgamma response-element-driven luciferase reporter gene activation in human adipocytes. Finally, we treated 14 obese men for 10 days with placebo crossed over with 150 mg/day . Subcutaneous  was analyzed for mRNA expression of adiponectin and lipoprotein lipase.Telmisartan and , and to a lesser degree losartan, induced adipogenesis and activated PPARgamma-target genes. This stimulation of PPARgamma-target genes was prevented by the PPARgamma antagonist GW9662. Eprosartan had no effect. Paradoxically, all ARB activated the luciferase reporter gene. PPARgamma activity increased approximately two-fold with pioglitazone and 1.5-fold with the ARB in all assays. In the cross-over clinical study,  lowered blood pressure but had no effect on adiponectin or lipoprotein lipase mRNA expression.Our data are the first to show that ARB induce adipogenesis and PPARgamma-target gene expression in human adipocytes. Pharmacokinetic differences may contribute to the heterogeneous effects on  and preadipocyte differentiation.

However, the direct effects of hypercholesterolemia on the myocardium and mechanisms are not completely understood. It has been demonstrated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) ligand agonists attenuate cardiac hypertrophy through anti-inflammatory effects. The present study investigated the effects of PPARgamma agonists on hypercholesterolemia-dependent, renin-angiotensin-system-related cardiac hypertrophy. The findings showed that left ventricular hypertrophy, eminent cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and  deposits in myocardium were observed in the rats fed a cholesterol-rich diet for 6 months, while these characteristic pathological alterations and the increase in angiotensin II (ANG II) level and over-expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) in the left ventricular tissues induced by the cholesterol-rich diet were significantly suppressed to equal extents by rosiglitazone and . In contrast, expression of angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT(2)R) was upregulated by these two drugs. In addition,  was markedly improved. The above findings suggest that the cardioprotection of the PPARgamma agonist against cardiac hypertrophy evoked by hypercholesterolemia in rats is mediated partially by the improvement of  profile, the reduction of ANG II level in the local tissue along with the downregulation of AT(1)R expression, and upregulation of AT(2)R expression.2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15897788>Effects of doxazosin and  on blood pressure and metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension.</a></h2><p>The objective of this trial was to compare the metabolic effects of long-term treatment with doxazosin to those of  in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension.

Angiotensin antagonism can slow the progression of renal impairment in diabetes. The present study was thus designed to examine the effect of an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist,  on renal function, oxidative stress and nitric oxide (NO) release in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (65 mg/kg) in rats. After 4 weeks of STZ injection, rats were divided into four groups: the control rats, diabetic rats and diabetic rats treated with  (25 and 50 mg/kg, orally) respectively till 8 weeks starting from 4 weeks after STZ injection. Renal function was assessed by creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine clearance and urea clearance. Oxidative stress was measured by renal malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase. We also measured renal nitrite levels.At the end of the 8th week, diabetic rats exhibited renal dysfunction as evidenced by reduced creatinine and urea clearance along with enhanced albumin excretion rate as compared with control rats. Biochemical analysis of kidneys revealed a marked increase in oxidative stress demonstrated by increased  peroxidation and decreased activities of key antioxidant enzymes, GSH, SOD and catalase in diabetic rats. NO release was also significantly higher in diabetic rats than controls. Chronic treatment with  in diabetic rats significantly attenuated both renal dysfunction and oxidative stress along with increased NO levels as compared with untreated diabetic rats. The kidneys of diabetic rats showed morphological changes such as hyaline casts, glomerular thickening and moderate interstitial fibrosis and arteriolopathy, whereas  administration markedly prevented diabetic-induced renal morphological alterations.The present study suggests that oxidative stress/nitrosative stress is increased in the diabetic kidney and AT1 receptor blockade can prevent these changes. The results also suggest that in STZ-induced diabetic rats, the protective action of  might be mediated, at least in part, by its effect on tissue oxidant/antioxidant status.2004 S.

Huangkui capsule (HKC), an extract from AM, has been proved clinically effective in improving renal inflammation and glomerular injury in CKD. However, the mechanisms of HKC are still not fully understood.Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α/γ dual agonists have the potential to be used as therapeutic agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy (DN). This study evaluated the function of Huangkui capsule (HKC), an extract from Abelmoschus manihot (L.) medic (AM), as a dual agonist for PPARα/γ and investigated its anti-DN effects in a DN rat model.ChIP and reporter gene assays were performed and the expression of PPARα/γ target genes was monitored to examine the ability of HKC to activate PPARα/γ. DN was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats via unilateral nephrectomy and intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. HKC was administered to the diabetic nephropathy rats at three different doses: high dose HKC (300mg/kg/d); middle dose HKC (175mg/kg/d); and low dose HKC (75mg/kg/d).  (4mg/kg/d body weight) was used as a positive control. Following 12 weeks' treatment, we measured general status, renal morphological appearance, proteinuria, blood biochemical parameters, and glomerular morphological changes. The expression of collagen IV, TGFβ, TNFα and IL-6 in renal tissue was evaluated. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in renal tissue was also analyzed.HKC enhanced the transcriptional activity of PPARα and PPARγ in cultured cells, livers and kidneys of DN rats, and it reduced serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels and fat in livers of DN rats. Furthermore, HKC reduced the expressions of inflammatory genes in kidneys of DN rats. Strikingly, HKC reduced ER stress and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation in the liver and kidney of DN rats and subsequently improved renal injury.Our results show that HKC improved lipid  disorders by activating PPARα/γ and attenuating ER stress. HKC could dose-dependently ameliorate renal inflammation and glomerular injury in DN rats. These results suggest that HKC has potential as an anti-DN agent for the treatment of DN in humans.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

(50 mg/kg per day) strongly decreased lesion development after a 12-week treatment period (lesion size:  treated, 20,524 +/- 4,200 microm(2) vs. control, 99,600 +/- 14,500; 79.4% inhibition, p < 0.001). This effect was not due to an effect of  on lipoprotein levels because  slightly increased total cholesterol levels and decreased the ratio of Apo A-I relative to Apo B levels. Immunochemical analysis of the atherosclerotic lesions using the mac3 monoclonal antibody showed the presence of macrophages in the lesions of control mice, whereas sections from -treated animals only showed occasional labeling in the lesion area. These data suggest that  inhibits monocyte/macrophage influx into the vessel wall. Therefore, expression levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), as well as other chemokines involved in macrophage infiltration into the lesion area, were measured in the aortic sinus of control and -treated animals.  treatment strongly decreased MCP-1 mRNA levels as well as MCP-1 immunostaining in the lesion area. This effect of  on MCP-1 occurred without an effect on CCR2, the receptor of MCP-1. Expression of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, another CC chemokine expressed in atherosclerotic lesions, was also reduced after  treatment, without effect on CCR3 and CCR5, the receptors of MIP-1alpha. Concomitantly, the expression of the angiogenic chemokines KC and MIP-2, which are functionally related to interleukin-8, were downregulated, whereas their shared receptor CXCR2 was upregulated. These data suggest that inhibition of the inflammatory component of lesion progression plays an important role in the inhibitory effect of AT1 receptor antagonists on atherosclerotic lesion formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22469867>Therapeutic effects of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, ,             on non-alcoholic steatohepatitis using FLS-ob/ob male mice.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the hepatic manifestation of a metabolic syndrome characterized by accumulation of hepatic , inflammation and varying degrees of fibrosis.

This study examined the effects of an AT-II receptor blocker, , on NASH using fatty liver Shionogi (FLS)-ob/ob male mice as the closest animal model of human metabolic syndrome-related NASH.  (30 mg/kg/day) was orally administered to FLS-ob/ob mice for 12 weeks ( group). The effects of  on steatohepatitis were examined using factors including steatosis, fibrosis, inflammation and oxidative stress. The areas of hepatic fibrosis and hepatic hydroxyproline content were significantly lower in the  group compared to controls. The areas of α-smooth muscle actin-positivity and F4/80-positive cells were significantly decreased in the  group. The percentage of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG)-positive cells and 8-OHdG DNA content were significantly decreased in the  group compared to controls. Levels of RNA expression for procollagen I, transforming growth factor β1, tumor necrosis factor-α, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and fatty acid synthase were significantly lower in the  group compared to controls. In contrast, the gene expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α was significantly higher in the  group compared to controls.  administration improved hepatic steatosis and attenuated the progression of hepatic fibrosis by inhibiting the activation of hepatic stellate cells and Kupffer cells and reducing oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20649581> treatment up-regulates hepatic expression of PPARalpha and its target genes in obese Koletsky (fa(k)/fa(k)) rats: a link to amelioration of hypertriglyceridaemia.</a></h2><p>Hypertriglyceridaemia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. , a well-established angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)) blocker, improves hypertriglyceridaemia in rodents and humans but the underlying mechanism of action is unclear.Male obese Koletsky (fa(k)/fa(k)) rats, which exhibit spontaneous hypertension and metabolic abnormalities, received  (40 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) or vehicle by oral gavage over 7 weeks.

Our previous studies demonstrated that administration of a subpressor dose of angiotensin (Ang) II sensitizes subsequent Ang II-elicited hypertension. The present study tested whether high-fat diet (HFD) feeding also sensitizes the Ang II-elicited hypertensive response and whether HFD-induced sensitization is mediated by an increase in renin-angiotensin system activity and inflammatory mechanisms in the brain. HFD did not increase baseline blood pressure, but enhanced the hypertensive response to Ang II compared with a normal-fat diet. The sensitization produced by the HFD was abolished by concomitant central infusions of either a tumor necrosis factor-α synthesis inhibitor, pentoxifylline, an Ang II type 1 receptor blocker, , or an inhibitor of microglial activation, minocycline. Furthermore, central pretreatment with tumor necrosis factor-α mimicked the sensitizing action of a central subpressor dose of Ang II, whereas central pentoxifylline or minocycline abolished this Ang II-induced sensitization. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of lamina terminalis tissue indicated that HFD feeding, central tumor necrosis factor-α, or a central subpressor dose of Ang II upregulated mRNA expression of several components of the renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokines, whereas inhibition of Ang II type 1 receptor and of inflammation reversed these changes. The results suggest that HFD-induced sensitization of Ang II-elicited hypertension is mediated by upregulation of the brain renin-angiotensin system and of central proinflammatory cytokines.© 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30351976>Protective effect of  against doxorubicin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats: implication of AMPK, PI3K/Akt, and mTOR signaling pathways.</a></h2><p>Nephrotoxicity is one of the serious undesirable effects related to doxorubicin (DOX). Herein, we have investigated the potential protective effect of  (IRB) against chronic nephrotoxicity induced by DOX, and the implication of different mechanistic pathways underlying these effects. Rats were treated with either DOX (2.5 mg/kg i.p., 3 times/week) for 2 weeks, and (or) IRB (40 mg/kg, daily) for 3 weeks. IRB prohibited nephrotoxicity induced by DOX, which was evident by the increase in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels and histopathological changes. IRB improved DOX-induced alterations in oxidative status by diminishing  peroxidation and upregulating the antioxidant enzymes. Also, upon DOX treatment, the renal expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and caspase-3 were significantly increased; IRB diminished DOX-induced alterations in these parameters. Moreover, DOX significantly decreased the expression level of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Meanwhile, DOX induced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways that cross talked with AMPK. On the contrary, IRB successfully counterbalanced all these effects. Collectively, these outcomes suggest that the modulation of AMPK, PI3K, Akt, and mTOR pathways plays a critical role in conferring the protective effects of IRB against DOX nephrotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22490812>[Triptolide combined with  synergistically blocks podocyte injury in a type 2 diabetes rat model].</a></h2><p>To investigate the protective effect of combination of triptolide and  on the podocytes in a type 2 diabetic(T2DM) rat model, and evaluate its mechanism.T2DM rats were induced by fed with high-sucrose-high- diet combined with a low dose of streptozocin. The rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: normal control group (NC, n = 10), diabetes group (DM, n = 11), triptolide treatment group (DT, n = 12),  treatment group (DI, n = 12) and triptolide combined with  treatment group (DTI, n = 13). Ultrastructure of podocytes was observed by electronic microscopy and urinary albumin (UAL) excretion by ELISA was determined after 8 weeks. The expression of nephrin and bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)β(1) mRNA and proteins were detected by immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR and Western blot.Increased UAL was significantly attenuated in all treatment groups. Compared to NC group, UAL in DM group was increased significantly (0.45 ± 0.09 vs 6.36 ± 0.87, P < 0.01), while decreased in triptolide or  alone treatment group (2.48 ± 0.37 and 2.68 ± 0.42, both P < 0.01).

A previous study revealed that rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD) have an enhanced hypertensive response to subsequent angiotensin II administration that is mediated at least, in part, by increased activity of brain renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokines. This study tested whether leptin mediates this HFD-induced sensitization of angiotensin II-elicited hypertension by interacting with brain renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokine mechanisms. Rats fed an HFD for 3 weeks had significant increases in white adipose tissue mass, plasma leptin levels, and mRNA expression of leptin and its receptors in the lamina terminalis and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. Central infusion of a leptin receptor antagonist during HFD feeding abolished HFD sensitization of angiotensin II-elicited hypertension. Furthermore, central infusion of leptin mimicked the sensitizing action of HFD. Concomitant central infusions of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist , the tumor necrosis factor-α synthesis inhibitor pentoxifylline, or the inhibitor of microglial activation minocycline prevented the sensitization produced by central infusion of leptin. RT-PCR analysis indicated that either HFD or leptin administration upregulated mRNA expression of several components of the renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokines in the lamina terminalis and paraventricular nucleus. The leptin antagonist and the inhibitors of angiotensin II type 1 receptor, tumor necrosis factor-α synthesis, and microglial activation all reversed the expression of these genes. The results suggest that HFD-induced sensitization of angiotensin II-elicited hypertension is mediated by leptin through upregulation of central renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokines.© 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12577466>[Effect of --angiotensin II type I receptor inhibitor on oxidative  of lipids in essential hypertension].</a></h2><p>We evaluated the alters in plasma vasoconstriction eicosanoids (LTC4, TXB2) and diene conjugates (DC) levels in patients with essential hypertension (EH) after chronic (30 days, 235 mg per day) of irbezartane (inhibitor of ANG II type 1 receptor with prolongation action "Aprovel" from "Sanofi") oral administration.

Antihypertensive treatment, particularly blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, contributes to prevent atherosclerosis-mediated cardiovascular events. Direct comparison of different antihypertensive treatments on atherosclerosis and particularly plaque stabilization is sparse. ApoE(-/-) mice with vulnerable (2-kidney, 1-clip renovascular hypertension model) or stable (1-kidney, 1-clip renovascular hypertension model) atherosclerotic plaques were used. Mice were treated with aliskiren (renin inhibitor),  (angiotensin-receptor blocker), atenolol (beta-blocker), or amlodipine (calcium channel blocker). Atherosclerosis characteristics were assessed. Hemodynamic and hormonal parameters were measured. Aliskiren and  significantly prevented atherosclerosis progression in 2-kidney, 1-clip mice. Indeed, compared with untreated animals, plaques showed thinner fibrous cap (P<0.05); smaller  core (P<0.05); decreased media degeneration, layering, and macrophage content (P<0.05); and increased smooth muscle cell content (P<0.05). Interestingly, aliskiren significantly increased the smooth muscle cell compared with . Despite similar blood pressure lowering, only partial plaque stabilization was attained by atenolol and amlodipine. Amlodipine increased plaque smooth muscle cell content (P<0.05), whereas atenolol decreased plaque inflammation (P<0.05). This divergent effect was also observed in 1-kidney, 1-clip mice.

Specific renin-angiotensin system blockade prevents atherosclerosis progression. First, evidence is provided that direct renin inhibition mediates atherosclerotic plaque stabilization. In contrast, beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker treatment only partially stabilize plaques differently influencing atherogenesis. Angiotensin II decisively mediates plaque vulnerability. The plasma renin concentration measurement by an indirect method did not confirm the excessive increase of plasma renin concentration reported in the literature during aliskiren compared with  or amlodipine treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25551221>Angiotensin II receptor blocker ameliorates stress-induced adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>A strong causal link exists between psychological stress and insulin resistance as well with hypertension.

In addition, they may significantly reduce protein excretion and further slow the progression of renal disease.The choice of antihypertensive drugs in HIV-infected patients is complex and must take into account the metabolic pathways of antiretroviral drugs and antihypertensive drugs with the potential of pharmacokinetic interactions, as well as the effect of antihypertensive drugs on some biological parameters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22426690>Angiotensin II receptor type 1 blockers suppress the cell proliferation             effects of angiotensin II in breast cancer cells by inhibiting AT1R signaling.</a></h2><p>Chronic stress and a high- diet are well-documented risk factors associated with the renin-angiotensin system in the development of breast cancer. The angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) is a novel component of the renin-angiotensin system. Several recent studies have focused on the function of AT1R in cell proliferation during cancer development. Thus, we hypothesized that angiotensin II (Ang Ⅱ) can promote proliferation of breast cancer via activated AT1R; the activation of AT1R may play an important role in promoting breast cancer growth, and AT1R blocker (ARB) may suppress the promotional effect on proliferation by antagonizing AT1R. The expression level of AT1R was found to be significantly upregulated in breast cancer cells by immunohistochemistry, but no correlation between AT1R expression and ER/PR/Her-2 expression was observed. The AT1R(+)-MCF-7 cell line exhibited high expression of AT1R protein, and we generated the AT1R(-)-MCF-7 cell line using RNA interference. ARBs, and in particular , effectively inhibited the effects of Ang II on cell proliferation, cell cycle development and downstream AT1R signaling events, including the activation of the Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway and the transcription factors NF-κB and CREB.  also significantly altered p53, PCNA and cyclin D1 expression, which was also influenced by activated AT1R in AT1R(+)-MCF-7 cells. These results suggest that ARBs may be useful as a novel preventive and therapeutic strategy for treating breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17069818>Angiotensin II type 1-receptor antagonism prevents type IIA secretory phospholipase A2-dependent  peroxidation.</a></h2><p>Accumulation and modification of low density lipoproteins (LDL) within the vessel wall represent key events in atherogenesis. Secretory phospholipase A2 type IIA (sPLA2-IIA) modulates the enzymatic process of LDL-modification and was recently identified as an independent predictor of coronary events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Angiotensin II (ANG II) type 1 (AT1)-receptor blockade reduces LDL-modification and atherosclerotic plaque formation in rodent and primate models of atherosclerosis. Therefore, we assessed whether ANG II via its AT1-receptor enhances sPLA2-IIA-dependent  peroxidation in vitro and in patients with CAD. Stimulation of rat aortic smooth muscle cells with ANG II (10(-7) mol/L) enhanced sPLA2-IIA protein expression, activity as well as LDL-peroxidation, determined by western blot, activity assay and malondialdehyde (MDA)-assay and diene formation, respectively, and were blunted by AT1-receptor blockade (Losartan, 10(-5) mol/L). In addition, ANG II-induced sPLA2 activity and LDL-peroxidation were abolished by the sPLA2-IIa activity inhibitor LY311727 (10(-5) mol/L). To evaluate a potential clinical implication, patients (n=18) with angiographically documented CAD were treated with the AT1-receptor blocker  (IRB; 300 mg/d) for 12 weeks. Blood samples were obtained from patients pre- and post-treatment and from healthy volunteers. SPLA2-IIA serum level and activity, circulating antibodies against oxidized LDL (oxLDL), oxLDL and MDA were determined in patients and found to be significantly increased compared to healthy volunteers. IRB therapy reduced these markers of inflammation, whereas total cholesterol, HDL- and LDL-fractions remained unchanged. ANG II may elicit pro-atherosclerotic effects via type IIA sPLA2-dependent LDL-modifications. Chronical AT1-receptor blockade reduces sPLA2-IIA level and activity and subsequently  peroxidation. Theses findings represent a novel anti-atherosclerotic mechanism and imply that AT1-receptor blockade elicits anti-atherosclerotic potencies even in the absence of plasma cholesterol reduction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17303473>Metabolic actions of angiotensin receptor antagonists: PPAR-gamma agonist actions or a class effect?</a></h2><p>Accumulating basic and clinical data support the hypothesis that angiotensin receptor blockers have beneficial effects on glucose and  that are not shared by other classes of antihypertensive agents. These metabolic actions might only partially be shared by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Specific benefits beyond those of other angiotensin receptor blockers have been claimed for telemesartan and, to a lesser extent,  based on a partial agonist action on PPAR-gamma receptors. Although the evidence is strong in vitro, specific actions not shared by other angiotensin receptor blockers have not yet been convincingly demonstrated in vivo or in clinical trials. In many cases, a full range of doses has not been compared, and the apparent superiority of telmesartan could be an artifact of its higher receptor binding affinity, greater tissue penetration owing to lipophilicity, and longer half life.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20523035>Urinary pigment epithelium-derived factor as a marker of diabetic nephropathy.</a></h2><p>Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a serine protease inhibitor, regulates extracellular matrix production in the kidney. We sought the association between urinary PEDF (uPEDF) and development of nephropathy among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).Two human studies were performed in which uPEDF was determined by ELISA. These studies included (1) a cross-sectional study of T2DM (n = 228) and healthy controls (n = 46) [corrected] and (2) a longitudinal study of hypertensive T2DM with microalbuminuria (MA; n = 42) treated with  for 6 months. An animal study was performed in which PEDF was measured in the kidney and urine samples of control rats, rats rendered diabetic with streptozotocin that were also fed a high- diet, and diabetic rats treated with  for 3 months.Cross-sectional study: compared to controls, uPEDF was significantly higher in patients with diabetic nephropathy. uPEDF independently correlated with MA. In the MA group, uPEDF in patients with diabetic retinopathy was significantly higher than that in patients without diabetic retinopathy. Longitudinal study:  significantly decreased uPEDF in T2DM with MA. Animal study: in diabetic rats, increased PEDF was observed in both the urine and kidney samples. uPEDF showed a significant correlation with the expression of PEDF in the kidney.  could significantly decrease the PEDF expression in the kidneys of diabetic rats as well as uPEDF.uPEDF may serve as a novel marker for screening for nephropathy among patients with T2DM and monitoring the response to therapy.Copyright 2010 S.

Evidence have shown that transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a key mediator in the development of DN. However, treatment of DN by blocking the TGF-β1/Smad7 pathway remains limited. Xiaokeping mixture (XKP), a traditional Chinese herbal compound, has been used for treatment in patients with DN for many years.In the present study, TGF-β1/Smad7 pathway analysis was used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of XKP on DN rats induced by streptozotocin and to address the underlying molecular mechanism. Male rats were divided into four groups: normal control, untreated control group (fed with high fat), -treated DN, and XKP-treated DN, respectively. Levels of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, urine protein of 24 hours, and triacylglycerol were detected. Pathological changes of renal tissues were observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis were used to detect the expressions of TGF-β1 and Smad7.The results demonstrated that XKP can effectively reduce the levels of glucose, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, urine protein of 24 hours, and triacylglycerol. Further studies indicated that inhibition of DN in XKP-treated DN rats was associated with inhibition of TGF-β1/Smad7 signaling as demonstrated by downregulation of TGF-β1 but upregulation of Smad7.The data obtained from the present study indicate that XKP may be a therapeutic agent for DN.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16109807>Influences of AT1 receptor blockade on tissue  in obese men.</a></h2><p>ANG II applied to the interstitial space influences carbohydrate and  in a tissue-specific fashion. Thus endogenous ANG II may have a tonic effect on tissue  that could be reversed with ANG II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockade, particularly during adrenergic stimulation. We studied 14 obese men. They were treated for 10 days with the AT1 receptor blocker  or with placebo in a double-blind and crossover fashion. At the end of each treatment period, we assessed skeletal muscle and adipose tissue  using the microdialysis technique. The ethanol dilution technique was applied to follow changes in tissue blood flow. Measurements were obtained at baseline and during application of incremental isoproterenol concentrations through the microdialysis catheter. Blood pressure decreased from 133 +/- 3/84 +/- 3 to 128 +/- 3/79 +/- 2 mmHg for systolic and diastolic blood, respectively (P = 0.02 and 0.006, respectively) with AT1 receptor blockade. Isoproterenol perfusion caused a dose-dependent increase in dialysate glycerol in adipose tissue and in skeletal muscle.  slightly reduced the isoproterenol-induced glycerol response in adipose tissue (P < 0.05 by ANOVA). Ethanol ratio, interstitial glucose supply, and lactate production in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle were similar with placebo and . We conclude that AT1 receptor blockade in obese men does not reveal a major tonic ANG II effect on interstitial glucose supply, lipolysis, or glycolysis in skeletal muscle, either at rest or during beta-adrenergic stimulation. Endogeneous ANG II may slightly increase adipose tissue lipolysis. The mechanism may promote the redistribution of triglycerides from adipose tissue toward other organs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16723697>Loss of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 leads to the late development of angiotensin II-dependent glomerulosclerosis.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), a membrane-bound carboxymonopeptidase highly expressed in the kidney, functions as a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. Here we report early accumulation of fibrillar collagen in the glomerular mesangium of male ACE2 mutant (ACE2-/y) mice followed by development of glomerulosclerosis by 12 months of age whereas female ACE2 mutant (ACE2-/-) mice were relatively protected. Progressive kidney injury was associated with increased deposition of collagen I, collagen III and fibronectin in the glomeruli and increased urinary albumin excretion compared to age-matched control mice. These structural and functional changes in the glomeruli of male ACE2 mutant mice were prevented by treatment with the angiotensin II type-1 receptor antagonist . Loss of ACE2 was associated with a marked increase in renal  peroxidation product formation and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 in glomeruli, events that are also prevented by angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockade. We conclude that deletion of the ACE2 gene leads to the development of angiotensin II-dependent glomerular injury in male mice. These findings have important implications for our understanding of ACE2, the renin-angiotensin system, and gender in renal injury, with ACE2 likely to be an important therapeutic target in kidney disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30634212>[Regulatory Effect of Chinese Drugs for Stasis Removing and Collaterals Dredging on the Expres- sions of podocin and CD2AP in Podocyte Slit Diaphragm of Diabetic Nephropathy Rats].</a></h2><p>To observe the regulatory effect of Chinese drugs for stasis removing and collaterals dredging (CDSRCD) on the expressions of podocin and CD2AP in podocyte slit diaphragm (SD) of diabetic nephropathy (DN) rats.DN rat model was duplicated in 40 male Sprague- Dawley rats by feeding high fat high glucose diet combined with intraperitoneally injecting 1 % streptozoto- cin (STZ, 35 mg/kg). Totally 36 successfully modeled rats were divided into the model group, the CD- SRCD group,- and the  group according to random digit table, 12 in each group. Besides, anoth- er 10 normal rats were recruited as a normal group. Rats in the CDSRCD group and the  group were intragastrically fed with CDSRCD and  respectively. Rats in the normal group and the mod- el group were fed with equal volume of distilled water at the same time. 24 h urine protein quantitation was detected using ELISA at various time points. Body weight (BW) , kidney weight ( KW), kidney index (KI) , fasting blood glucose (FBG) , serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and uric acid (UA) in each group were detected after 16 weeks of intervention. The pathomorphological changes of re- nal tissue were observed under light microscope and electron microscope respectively. The protein and mRNA expressions of podocin and CD2AP were detected by Western blot and Real-time PCR respectively.(1) Compared with the normal group, 24 h urine protein quantitation significantly increased at week 4, 8, 12, and 16, respectively (P <0. 01). BW was decreased; KI and levels of FBG, SCr, BUN, and UA all increased after modeling (P <0. 01). Compared with the model group, 24 h urine protein quan- titation significantly decreased in the CDSRCD group and the  group at week 4, 8, 12, and 16, respectively (P <0. 01). Besides, it was more obviously reduced in the CDSRCD group than in the irbe- sartan group (P <0. 05, P <0.01). BUN level obviously decreased both in the CDSRCD group and the  group after modeling (P <0. 05, P <0. 01). (2) Results of renal pathology showed that disar- ranged renal structure, obviously thickened basement membrane, severely proliferated mesenteria, widely fused foot processes in the model group. All these pathological changes were attenuated in the CD- SRCD group and the  group to some degree. (3) Results of Western blot and Real-time PCR showed, compared with the normal group, protein and mRNA expressions of podocin and CD2AP decreased in the model group (P <0. 01). Compared with the model group, protein and mRNA expressions of podocin and CD2AP increased in the CDSRCD group and the  group (P <0. 01). Protein and mRNA expressions of podocin and CD2AP increased more in the CDSRCD group than in the  group (P <0. 05).CDSRCD could protect renal function by lowering urinary protein in DN rats, improve renal pathological changes. Its mechanism might be related to up-regulating mRNA and protein expressions of podocin and CD2AP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16877964> restores the in-vivo insulin signaling pathway leading to Akt activation in obese Zucker rats.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin II (AII) has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension and insulin resistance. In addition, the administration of selective AII type 1 receptor blockers has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity. However, only a few studies have addressed the molecular mechanisms involved in this association. Furthermore, in a previous study we illustrated that obese Zucker rats (OZR) present increased serine 994 (Ser994) phosphorylation of hepatic insulin receptor, and this event seems to be implicated in the regulation of the intrinsic IRK in this model of insulin resistance.We examined the effects of chronic treatment with  (50 mg/kg a day for 6 months) on the hepatic insulin signaling system of OZR.The extent of phosphorylation of several components of the insulin signaling system was assessed by immunoprecipitation, followed by immunoblotting with phosphospecific antibodies. In addition, liver AII levels and  deposits were determined by immunohistochemistry and Oil red O, respectively.OZR displayed a marked attenuation in the in-vivo phosphorylation of several components of the insulin signaling pathways in the liver, together with significantly higher hepatic AII levels and hepatic steatosis when compared with lean Zucker rats. We found that in the livers of OZR long-term administration of  is associated with: (i) increased insulin-stimulated insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation; (ii) decreased insulin receptor Ser994 phosphorylation; (iii) augmented insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1 and 2 abundance and tyrosine phosphorylation; (iv) augmented association between IRS and the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; (v) increased insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation; and (vi) decreased hepatic steatosis.The present study provides substantial information that demonstrates that long-term selective AII blockade by  improves insulin signaling and is associated with decreased insulin receptor Ser994 phosphorylation in the liver of a representative animal model of the human metabolic syndrome.</p></html>
