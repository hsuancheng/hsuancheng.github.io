<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27886644>Oral administration with  enhances the induction of intestinal T helper 1-like regulatory T cells in a murine model of food allergy.</a></h2><p>Although the development of T helper (Th)1-like regulatory T (Treg) cells under Th1 inflammatory conditions has been reported, the role of Th1-like Treg cells in Th2 allergic responses remains mostly unclear. We previously demonstrated that , the major sapogenin contained in the Chinese yam, attenuated food allergy and augmented Th1 and Treg immune responses. In this study, we hypothesized that  may enhance the induction of Th1-like Treg cells in the gut of mice with food allergy. Ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized BALB/c mice were gavaged daily with  and received repeatedly intragastric ovalbumin challenges to induce intestinal allergic responses. The induction of Foxp3 Treg cells co-expressing Th1-type transcription factors, cytokines and chemokines in the intestine was examined, and the mRNA expression of the chemokines corresponding to Th1-like Treg cells was measured.  administration increased the number of Foxp3 Treg cells co-expressing Th1 markers, including CCR5, CXCR3, IFN-γ and T-bet in the intestine, and enhanced populations of Foxp3IFN-γ and Foxp3T-bet cells that expressed the regulatory cytokine IL-10 in the Peyer's patches.  also augmented the intestinal expression of CXCR3, CCL3, and CXCL10. Concordantly,  increased the number of CXCR3Foxp3IL-10 cells in the Peyer's patches. Our data demonstrated the enhanced induction of Th1-like Treg cells in allergic mice treated with , providing evidence to suggest a role for Th1-like Treg cells in -mediated anti-allergic effects against Th2-type allergy.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The draining lymph node is an important immune system component that contains a number of antigen-presenting cells, which induce rapid immune responses to foreign antigens. Current studies have shown that higher expression of CD169 on lymph node sinus macrophages is associated with the induction of anti-tumor . In the present study, we searched for natural compounds that regulate the CD169-positive phenotype in macrophages to identify potential new anti-cancer agents targeting macrophage activation. Among 50 natural compounds, aculeatiside A, naringin, and onionin A significantly induced the CD169-positive phenotype in human monocyte-derived macrophages. These compounds also induced CD169 overexpression and secretion of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-12, in murine macrophages. Subcutaneous injection of aculeatiside A and naringin enhanced mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL12, and CD169 in regional lymph nodes in mice. These findings suggest aculeatiside A and naringin may enhance anti-tumor immune responses by inducing CD169-positive macrophages in lymph nodes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30305604> promotes antitumor  and PD-1 antibody efficacy against melanoma by regulating intestinal microbiota.</a></h2><p>, a natural steroidal saponin, can exert antitumor effect by regulating immune function and improving intestinal microbiota. The response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy is associated with intestinal microbiota and effector T cells in tumor microenvironment. We hypothesize that the modulation of  on intestinal microbiota can facilitate antitumor  and the therapeutic efficacy of PD-1 antibody. In melanoma-bearing C57BL/6 mice, we observed that the anti-melanoma effect of  relied more on antitumor  than direct tumor inhibition activity evidenced by obvious CD4/CD8 T-cell infiltration and IFN-γ expression in tumor tissues, and it could improve the compositions of intestinal microbiota. Antibiotics impaired the therapeutic efficacy and  responses of  through disturbing intestinal microbiota, indicating the importance of intestinal microbiota in 's in vivo antitumor activity. More importantly, the combined administration of PD-1 antibody with  aggravated the tumor necrosis and apoptosis by eliciting augmented T-cell responses. Taken together,  can be used as a microecological regulator to induce antitumor  and improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint antibody, making it more suitable for the treatment of malignant tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26694357>Elicitation of  Production in Trigonella foenum-graecum (Fenugreek) Seedlings by Methyl Jasmonate.</a></h2><p>The effects of methyl jasmonate (MeJA), an elicitor of plant defense mechanisms, on the biosynthesis of , a steroidal saponin, were investigated in six fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) varieties (Gujarat Methi-2, Kasuri-1, Kasuri-2, Pusa Early Branching, Rajasthan Methi and Maharashtra Methi-5). Treatment with 0.01% MeJA increased  levels, in 12 days old seedlings, from 0.5%-0.9% to 1.1%-1.8%. In addition, MeJA upregulated the expression of two pivotal genes of the mevalonate pathway, the metabolic route leading to : 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG) and sterol-3-β-glucosyl transferase (STRL). In particular, MeJA increased the expression of HMG and STRL genes by 3.2- and 22.2-fold, respectively, in the Gujarat Methi-2 variety, and by 25.4- and 28.4-fold, respectively, in the Kasuri-2 variety. Therefore, MeJA may be considered a promising elicitor for  production by fenugreek plants.</p></html>
