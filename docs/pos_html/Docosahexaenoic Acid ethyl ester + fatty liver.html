Each group of male Sprague-Dawley rats was pair fed 15% (w/w) of either DHA-triglycerides (DHA-TG), DHA-ethyl esters (DHA-EE) or DHA-phospholipids (DHA-PL) for up to 3 weeks. The palm oil (supplemented with 20% soybean oil) diet without DHA was fed as the control. Dietary DHA oils lowered plasma triglyceride concentrations in rats fed DHA-TG (by 30%), DHA-EE (by 45%) and DHA-PL (by 27%), compared to control. The incorporation of dietary DHA into plasma and  phospholipids was more pronounced in the DHA-TG and DHA-EE group than in the DHA-PL group. However, DHA oil intake negatively influenced lipid peroxidation in both plasma and . Phospholipid peroxidation in plasma and  was significantly higher than control in rats fed DHA-TG or DHA-EE, but not DHA-PL. These results are consistent with increased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and decreased alpha-tocopherol levels in plasma and . In addition,  microsomes from rats of each group were exposed to a mixture of chelated iron (Fe(3+)/ADP) and NADPH to determine the rate of peroxidative damage. During NADPH-dependent peroxidation of microsomes, the accumulation of phospholipid hydroperoxides, as well as TBARS, were elevated and alpha-tocopherol levels were significantly exhausted in DHA-TG and DHA-EE groups. During microsomal lipid peroxidation, there was a greater loss of n-3  acids (mainly DHA) than of n-6  acids, including arachidonic acid (20:4n-6). These results indicate that polyunsaturation of n-3  acids is the most important target for lipid peroxidation. This suggests that the ingestion of large amounts of DHA oil enhances lipid peroxidation in the target membranes where greater amounts of n-3  acids are incorporated, thereby increasing the peroxidizability and possibly accelerating the atherosclerotic process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8729110>Docosahexaenoic acid therapy in docosahexaenoic acid-deficient patients with disorders of peroxisomal biogenesis.</a></h2><p>A patient with classic Zellweger syndrome was treated with  (DHA-EE) for three months. Five other patients with Zellweger variants (four of them less than one-year-old and a five-year-old) were treated with DHA-EE until normalization of the DHA levels in erythrocytes. When arachidonic acid (AA) concentration decreased, AA was added to the diet. Thereafter, a combined treatment with DHA plus AA followed, in a variable proportion that allowed the high levels of DHA in erythrocytes to be maintained. In the patient with Zellweger syndrome, DHA therapy produced an increase in plasmalogen and a decrease in 26:0 and 26:1. No clear clinical improvement could be detected in this patient during the short period of treatment with DHA-EE. The most consistent clinical effect produced by DHA therapy in the other patients with disorders of peroxisomal biogenesis was visual improvement, even in those patients that were virtually blind before the treatment. In general, the developmental curve began to accelerate. The infants became more alert, acquired better visual and social contact and muscular tone improved, with the beginning of good head control. The  tests tended to normalize and some patients showed a reduction of hepatomegaly. All these favorable changes occurred when the patients were taking the DHA-EE alone. In some of the patients, muscular tone seemed to improve further after introducing AA supplements. From the biochemical point of view, the plasmalogen levels increased in most cases in erythrocytes, and the two ratios 26:0/22:0 and 26:1/22:0 decreased in plasma. In some patients there was a tendency for 26:1 to increase in plasma and for 18:0 plasmalogen to decrease in erythrocytes when AA was introduced in the diet. The significance of these findings remains to be elucidated, but they stress the importance of strict monitoring and control of the polyunsaturated  acids status during DHA therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9674774>MRI evidence that  improves myelination in generalized peroxisomal disorders.</a></h2><p>We have found that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3), an important constituent of the CNS and retina, is dramatically decreased in patients with generalized peroxisomal disorders. Such a DHA deficiency could be pathogenic. Our aim was to test the possible beneficial effects of normalizing the DHA levels in these patients. The current report focuses on MRI changes during the treatment and reports follow-up evidence of myelin improvement in five peroxisomal disorder patients treated with DHA.DHA ethyl ester (DHA-EE), about 90% pure, was used at daily oral doses of 100 to 600 mg. The treatment was monitored both clinically and biochemically, with periodic neurophysiologic and MRI examinations and repeated controls of  tests and blood  acids by capillary column gas chromatography.DHA-EE normalized the blood levels of DHA in a few weeks. The levels of very-long-chain  acids decreased in plasma and those of plasmalogens increased in erythrocytes. Visual and  function improved. On MRI, a virtual normalization of the brain myelin images was found in the three youngest patients. A clear improvement was noticed in the other two.The beneficial effects obtained indicate that DHA deficiency plays an important role in the pathogenesis of peroxisomal disease, probably in relation to myelinogenesis. Early initiation of DHA therapy is thus strongly recommended in patients with generalized peroxisomal disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11478386>Restoring the DHA levels in the brains of Zellweger patients.</a></h2><p>Patients with the Zellweger syndrome and its variants have very low levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the brain, retina, and other tissues. Such a marked DHA deficiency could be related to the pathogenesis of peroxisomal disorders. Therefore, restoring the DHA levels in these patients can probably improve the clinical course of the disease. With this rationale, 20 patients with generalized peroxisomal disorders have been treated to date with DHA ethyl ester, at daily doses of 100-500 mg, for variable periods of time. Treatment has been always accompanied by a nutritious diet, normal for the age, in order to provide all the necessary nutrients and avoid a polyunsaturated  acid (PUFA) imbalance. The most constant improvement has been normalization of the DHA levels and  function. Vision has improved in about half the patients and muscle tone has generally increased. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination revealed improvement of myelination in 9 patients. Significantly, the clinical improvement has been most marked in those patients who started the treatment before 6 mo of age. Biochemically, the plasma very long-chain  acids (VLCFA) 26:0 and 26:1n-9 decreased markedly despite the complete diet provided. In erythrocytes, the plasmalogen ratio 18: ODMA/18:0 increased in most cases, and sometimes even normalized. All these beneficial effects suggest that DHA deficiency plays a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of peroxisomal disease. Because DHA accretion is maximal during early brain development, it is essential to initiate the treatment as soon as possible. Otherwise, restoration of brain DHA levels and prevention of further damage will not be possible.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17911005>Levels of plasma insulin, leptin and adiponectin, and activities of key enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism in skeletal muscle and  in fasted ICR mice fed dietary n-3 polyunsaturated  acids.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanisms related to plasma glucose concentration in mice fed a diet rich in n-3 polyunsaturated  acids (n-3 PUFAs). Male Crlj:CD-1 (ICR) mice were fed experimental diets containing 6% lard (LD), 6% fish oil (FO) or 4.1% lard plus 1.5%  and 0.4% eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester (DE) for 12 weeks. There were no marked differences in plasma glucose and insulin concentration changes on glucose tolerance test between the three dietary groups. At the end of the feeding trial, plasma glucose concentration was significantly lower in fasted mice in the FO group than in those in the LD group (P<.005). Plasma adiponectin concentration was significantly higher in the FO group than in the LD group (P<.05). Hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activities in skeletal muscle tended to be lower in the FO group than in the LD group, while there were no differences in glucokinase and phosphofructokinase activities in  between the three dietary groups. However, hepatic glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activity was 53-fold and 4.2-fold higher in the FO group than in the LD and DE groups, respectively (P<.0005 and P<.05, respectively). These results suggest that the reduction in plasma glucose concentration in mice fed n-3 PUFAs is mainly caused by acceleration of glucose uptake and glycerol synthesis in the  rather than in the skeletal muscle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11210121>Dietary effects of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid esters on lipid metabolism and immune parameters in Sprague-Dawley rats.</a></h2><p>Sprague-Dawley rats were fed eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ethyl esters at the 2% level for 3 weeks to clarify their effects on immune functions. In the rats fed EPA or DHA, serum cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospholipid (PL) levels were significantly lower than those in the rats fed safflower oil. In PL fractions of serum, , lung, splenocytes, and peritoneal exudate cells (PEC), increases in linoleic and dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid contents and a decrease in arachidonic acid (AA) content were observed in the rats fed EPA or DHA. In addition, the EPA content increased in the rats fed EPA and DHA. In the rats fed EPA or DHA, a decrease of LTB4 productivity and an increase of LTBs productivity were observed in the PEC, in response to the treatment with 5 microM calcium ionophore A23187 for 20 min. The changes in leukotriene production were more marked in EPA-fed rats than in DHA-fed rats. These results suggest that dietary EPA affects lipid metabolism and leukotriene synthesis more strongly than DHA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11328678>Docosahexaenoic acid supplementation-increased oxidative damage in bone marrow DNA in aged rats and its relation to antioxidant vitamins.</a></h2><p>We compared the influence of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation on oxidative DNA damage in bone marrow between young and aged rats. As a marker of oxidative DNA damage, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in DNA was analyzed. Young (5-week-old) and aged (100-week-old) female Wistar rats were given DHA (300mg/kg body weight/day) or vehicle (control) orally for 12 weeks. The 8-OHdG in the bone marrow in the aged DHA group was significantly higher than that in the other groups. Vitamin E concentrations, however, did not differ among the groups regardless of the DHA supplementation. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) concentrations in the aged control group were approximately 1/2 those in the young control group. The concentrations of vitamin C tended to be higher in the young DHA group and lower in the aged DHA group when compared to their respective control groups. Changes in the concentrations of vitamin C and vitamin E in plasma were similar to those in the bone marrow. The activity of hepatic l-gulono- gamma -lactone oxidase, an enzyme responsible for vitamin C synthesis, corresponded well to the concentrations of vitamin C in the bone marrow and the plasma. These results suggest that in aged rats, but not young rats, excess supplementation of DHA induces oxidative DNA damage in bone marrow and that the decrease in vitamin C synthesis in aged rats is involved in the mechanisms of DNA damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15023399>Effect of n-3  acids on serum lipid levels and hepatic  acid metabolism in BALB/c.KOR-Apoeshl mice deficient in apolipoprotein E expression.</a></h2><p>N-3  acids exert a potent serum lipid-lowering effect in rodents mainly by affecting hepatic  acid oxidation and synthesis. However, it has been observed that fish oil and  do not lower serum lipid levels in apolipoprotein E (apoE)-knockout (Apoetm1Unc) mice generated by gene targeting. To test the hypothesis that apoE expression is required for n-3  acid-dependent regulation of serum lipid levels and hepatic  acid metabolism, we examined the effect of fish oil and n-3  acid ethyl esters on the activity and gene expression of hepatic enzymes involved in  acid oxidation and synthesis using an alternative apoE-deficient mouse model with the BALB/c genetic background (BALB/c.KOR-Apoeshl). ApoE-deficient mice were fed diets containing 9.4% palm oil, fish oil, or 5.4% palm oil and 1% EPA plus 3% DHA ethyl esters for 15 days. In contrast to the reported data on apoE-knockout mice, fish oil and n-3  acid ethyl esters greatly decreased serum triacylglycerol, cholesterol, and phospholipid levels in the Apoeshl mice. The decreases were greater with fish oil than with ethyl esters. The alterations by dietary n-3  acids of serum lipid levels were accompanied by parallel changes in the activity and mRNA levels of enzymes involved in hepatic  acid oxidation and synthesis. The reason for the discrepancy between the results of the current study and previous studies is unknown. However, our study at least indicates that a lack of apoE expression does not necessarily accompany deficits in the n-3  acid-dependent regulation of serum lipid levels and hepatic  acid metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22676394>Short term effects of different omega-3  acid formulation on lipid metabolism in mice fed high or low fat diet.</a></h2><p>Bioactivities of Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) depend on their chemical forms. The present study was to investigate short term effects of triglyceride (TG), ethyl ester (EE), free  acid (FFA) and phospholipid (PL) forms of omega-3  acid (FA) on lipid metabolism in mice, fed high fat or low fat diet.Male Balb/c mice were fed with 0.7% different Omega-3  acid formulation: DHA bound free  acid (DHA-FFA), DHA bound triglyceride (DHA-TG), DHA bound ethyl ester (DHA-EE) and DHA bound phospholipid (DHA-PL) for 1 week, with dietary fat levels at 5% and 22.5%. Serum and hepatic lipid concentrations were analyzed, as well as the  acid composition of  and brain.At low fat level, serum total cholesterol (TC) level in mice fed diets with DHA-FFA, DHA-EE and DHA-PL were significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). Hepatic TG level decreased significantly in mice fed diets with DHA-TG (P < 0.05), DHA-EE (P < 0.05) and DHA-PL (P < 0.05), while TC level in  was significantly lower in mice fed diets with TG and EE compared with the control group (P < 0.05). At high fat level, mice fed diets with DHA-EE and DHA-PL had significantly lower hepatic TC level compared with the control diet (P < 0.05). Hepatic PL concentration experienced a significant increase in mice fed the diet with PL at high fat level (P < 0.05). Furthermore, both at low and high fat levels, hepatic DHA level significantly increased and AA level significantly decreased in all forms of DHA groups (P < 0.05), compared to control groups at two different fat levels, respectively. Additionally, cerebral DHA level in mice fed diets with DHA-FFA, DHA-EE and DHA-PL significantly increased compared with the control at high fat level (P < 0.05), but no significant differences were observed among dietary treatments for mice fed diets with low fat level.The present study suggested that not only total dietary fat content but also the molecular forms of omega-3  acids contributed to lipid metabolism in mice. DHA-PL showed effective bioactivity in decreasing hepatic and serum TC, TG levels and increasing omega-3 concentration in  and brain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1825741>Changes in  acid composition in rat blood and organs after infusion of .</a></h2><p>An infusible emulsion of  (DHA-EE) was prepared. One hundred milliliters of the emulsion contained 10 g DHA-EE (90% pure). Three milliliters of the emulsion was infused into tail veins of 22 Wistar rats weighing approximately 300 g. They were killed 1, 6, and 24 h and 3 and 7 d after the infusion, and  acid composition of various organs and plasma was analyzed along with that of control rats. DHA concentrations reached their peaks within 24 h after DHA infusion in plasma lipid fractions and in the phospholipid fraction of  and lung. DHA did not increase at all in cardiac phospholipid fraction. However, DHA concentrations increased markedly (from 0.7% to 11%) in the free  acid fraction of heart 1 h after the infusion. DHA emulsion might be useful for patients in whom a rapid increment in DHA in tissues is beneficial.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10618001>Therapeutic effects of  in patients with generalized peroxisomal disorders.</a></h2><p>Generalized peroxisomal disorders are severe congenital diseases that involve the central nervous system, leading to severe psychomotor retardation, retinopathy,  disease, and early death. In these disorders, peroxisomes are not normally formed and their enzymes are deficient. Characteristically, plasmalogen synthesis and beta-oxidation of very-long-chain  acids (VLCFAs) are affected. We found that patients with generalized peroxisomal disorders have a profound brain deficiency of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) and low DHA concentrations in all tissues and the blood. Given the fundamental role of DHA in neuronal and retinal membranes, a DHA deficiency of this magnitude might be pathogenic. Thus, we studied the possible therapeutic effect of normalizing DHA concentrations in patients with peroxisomal disorders. We chose the DHA ethyl ester (DHA-EE) because of its high degree of purity at daily oral doses of 100-500 mg. This article summarizes the results of treatment of 13 patients with DHA-EE, with some follow-up evidence of clinical improvement. Supplementation with DHA-EE normalized blood DHA values within a few weeks. Plasmalogen concentrations increased in erythrocytes in most patients and after DHA concentrations were normalized, amounts of VLCFAs decreased in plasma.  enzymes returned almost to normal in most cases. From a clinical viewpoint, most patients showed improvement in vision,  function, muscle tone, and social contact. In 3 patients, normalization of brain myelin was detected by magnetic resonance imaging. In 3 others, myelination improved. In a seventh patient, myelination is progressing at a normal rate. These results suggest a fundamental role of DHA in the pathogenesis of Zellweger syndrome. DHA therapy is thus strongly recommended, not only to alleviate symptoms in patients with life-threatening diseases, but also to clarify remaining questions regarding the role of DHA in health and disease.</p></html>
