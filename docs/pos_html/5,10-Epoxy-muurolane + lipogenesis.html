<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298611> Extract Reduces High-Fat Diet-Induced Obesity Through Regulation of  and  Pathways in Mice.</a></h2><p>Obesity is caused by an energy imbalance between food intake and energy expenditure, and has detrimental effects on human health. Platycodon () widely grows in Korea, Japan, and China. It has long been used for food and as a medicinal product. However, the mechanism of the improvement of obesity by platycodon was still not clear. Therefore, we investigated the detailed mechanisms of the antiobesity activity of platycodon extracts. Twenty mice (C57BL/6J) were placed into five groups. The test group received 1 g/kg platycodon extracts. The positive control group received 10 mg/kg orlistat, while the negative control and normal control groups received phosphate-buffered saline. The extracts were given orally daily for 8 weeks. The  treatment of platycodon extracts reduced body weight gain by 7.%, improved plasma lipid profiles. In the groups given platycodon extracts, leptin was significantly decreased whereas adiponectin was increased. Furthermore, platycodon extracts downregulated lipogenic gene (, lipoprotein lipase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and fatty acid synthase) expression and increased lipolysis genes (, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, hormone-sensitive lipase, and uncoupling proteins 2) in liver and white adipose tissue. In addition, platycodon extracts inhibited the expression of key adipogenic transcriptional factors. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that platycodon extracts ameliorate high-fat diet-induced obesity and its related metabolic disease by regulating multiple pathways. Dietary supplementation of platycodon extracts as a functional food and medicinal ingredients may be suitable for prevention and treatment of obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069877> induces growth inhibition of dedifferentiated liposarcoma.</a></h2><p>Well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDLPS) and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) are the most common types of liposarcoma. Although WDLPS and DDLPS patients receive intensive treatment including radical surgery and systemic therapy, their overall -year survival rates are 90% and 30%, respectively, indicating that DDLPS is clinically more aggressive. We examined whether adipogenic stimulation induces  in human WDLPS/DDLPS cells by using dexamethasone, indomethacin, insulin, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), all putative medications or drugs. Functional in vitro experiments showed that treatment with these four compounds induced adipogenic potency by transcriptional and translational upregulation of genes related to the maintenance of stemness and adipogenic differentiation. Using in vivo xenograft models, we found that the induction of stemness and  inhibited the tumorigenic potency of DDLPS. This study suggests a potential application of drug repositioning in which -inducing compounds could be used to treat DDLPS patients in a clinical setting.© 2019 The Authors.

To determine the underlying mechanisms of seasonal adaptions, transcriptome sequencing studies have been conducted in bears, ground squirrels and bats. Despite advances in identifying differentially expressed genes involved in metabolism, the precise mechanisms of these physiological adaptions remain unclear. In the present study, we examined liver of Chinese Soft-Shelled Turtle () and found that the contents of lipid droplet (LD) and triglyceride (TG) were significantly decreased during hibernation. Increases in mRNA expression levels of lipolysis-related genes and decreased levels of -related genes during hibernation indicated that LD hydrolysis was stimulated during hibernation. To continuously release fatty acids (FAs) from LD, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) was recruited and accumulated on the surface of LDs via activation of Cyclic Adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. Meanwhile, increased phosphorylation of the LD-associated protein, perilipin-, activated the enzyme activity of ATGL via interaction between comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58) and ATGL. Taken together, our results indicated that ATGL accumulation on the LD surface and its induced enzyme activity during hibernation promoted LD breakdown in the liver of Chinese Soft-Shelled Turtle (), thereby enhancing mitochondrial β-oxidation to maintain energy hemostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31324879>Bone morphogenetic protein 2 is a depot-specific regulator of human .</a></h2><p>Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) regulate  but it is not clear whether they influence regional adipose tissue (AT) development in humans.To characterise BMP2 expression, BMP2-SMAD1//8 signalling, and BMP2's potential effect on proliferation and  in human subcutaneous abdominal and gluteal AT and its constituent preadipocytes.BMP2 expression was measured in whole AT and immortalised preadipocytes via qPCR and Western blot; secreted/circulating BMP2 was measured by ELISA. The effect of BMP2 on preadipocyte proliferation was evaluated using a fluorescent assay. BMP2's effect on  in immortalised preadipocytes was determined via qPCR of adipogenic markers and cellular triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation. BMP2-SMAD1//8 signalling was assessed in immortalised preadipocytes via Western blot and qPCR of ID1 expression.BMP2 was expressed and released by abdominal and gluteal AT and preadipocytes. Exogenous BMP2 dose dependently promoted  in abdominal preadipocytes only; 50 ng/ml BMP2 increased PPARG2 expression (10-fold compared to vehicle, p < 0.001) and TAG accumulation (3-fold compared to vehicle; p < 0.001). BMP2 stimulated SMAD1//8 phosphorylation and ID1 expression in abdominal and gluteal preadipocytes but this was blocked by 500 nM K02288, a type 1 BMP receptor inhibitor (p < 0.001). Co-administration of 500 nM K02288 also inhibited the pro-adipogenic effect of 50 ng/ml BMP2 in abdominal cells; >90% inhibition of TAG accumulation (p < 0.001) and ~50% inhibition of PPARG2 expression (p < 0.001). The endogenous iron regulator erythroferrone reduced BMP2-SMAD1//8 signalling by ~30% specifically in subcutaneous abdominal preadipocytes (p < 0.01), suggesting it plays a role in restricting the expansion of the body's largest AT depot during energy deficiency. Additionally, a waist-hip ratio-increasing common polymorphism near BMP2 is an eQTL associated with ~15% lower BMP2 expression in abdominal and gluteal AT (p < 0.05) as well as altered adipocyte size in male abdominal AT (p < 0.05).These data implicate BMP2-SMAD1//8 signalling in depot-specific preadipocyte development and abdominal AT expansion in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31215681>Chronic retinoic acid treatment induces differentiation and changes in the metabolite levels of brown (pre)adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Dietary vitamin A status affects energy metabolism. The present study explored the effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) on the expression levels of molecules and metabolites of brown adipocytes. Chronic ATRA treatment was initiated during the early stage (days 0-8) or late stage (days 8-12) of . Treatment with ATRA during the early and late stage of  resulted in an increase in the expression level of Ucp1 and Cidea, genes highly expressed in brown adipocytes, on day 8 and day 12, respectively, whereas expression of Pgc-1α, another gene expressed during brown , was unaffected by ATRA. Non-targeted metabolomic analyses indicated that the pathways related to the glucose metabolism were affected by ATRA, irrespective of the differentiation stage. Cellular levels of glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, citric acid, and succinic acid decreased after ATRA treatment on days 8 and 12. In contrast, glucose level was higher in ATRA-treated cells on day 8, but it was lower on day 12. ATRA decreased the cellular level of aconitic acid, fumaric acid, and malic acid on day 12 but not on day 8. Furthermore, ATRA increased the expression level of Hxk2 and downregulated the expressions of G6pdh and Pfkl/Pfkp on day 8 but not on day 12. Together, the results indicate that the chronic treatment with ATRA stimulated the formation of activated brown adipocytes, eventually leading to alterations in the levels of cellular metabolites related to glucose metabolism. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Significance of the study treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) during the early and late stage of  increased the expression of Ucp1 and Cidea, genes highly expressed in brown adipocytes, on day 8 and day 12. Cellular levels of glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, citric acid, and succinic acid decreased after ATRA treatment on days 8 and 12.

Hydroxytyrosol (HT), a simple polyphenol found in virgin olive oil, is considered to be beneficial for cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. The current study determined whether HT could improve PM-induced adiposity and insulin resistance (IR), and explored the underlying mechanisms. Fifteen adult female C57BL/6j mice on a chow diet were randomly divided into three groups receiving (1) sterile PBS, (2) PM suspended in sterile PBS (1 mg/mL) and (3) PM+HT (50 mg/kg/day). PM/PBS exposure was administered by oropharynx instillation every other day and HT supplementation was achieved by gavage every day. Four-week PM exposure did not affect body weight, but significantly increased visceral fat mass. The abdominal adiposity coincided with adipocyte hypertrophy and proliferation in visceral white adipose tissue (WAT), as well as decreased metabolic activity in brown adipose tissue and subcutaneous WAT. PM enhanced the oxidative stress by diminishing antioxidant enzyme activities in liver and serum, whereas contents of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in liver and serum were elevated. These changes were accompanied by macrophage infiltration and activation of NF-κB pathway in the liver. Moreover, PM exposure led to glucose intolerance and insulin insensitivity, impaired hepatic glycogenesis, and decreased insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in peripheral tissues. Importantly, HT treatment prevented PM-induced visceral , oxidative stress, hepatic inflammation and NF-κB activation, systemic and peripheral IR. In vitro, after HepG2 cells were incubated with PM (0, , 25, 50, 100 and 200 μg/mL), reduced glutathione depletion and 4-HNE, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, MDA increment in a dose-dependent manner were observed; likewise, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Further, with antioxidant NAC and NF-κB inhibitor PDTC, we confirmed that HT attenuated PM-induced IR through restraining NF-κB activation evoked by oxidative stress. In addition, HT could expand gut microbiota richness, reduce pathogenic bacteria and accommodate the microbial architecture in PM-exposed mice, which were correlated with parameters of adiposity, oxidative stress and glycometabolism. HT could effectively correct imbalanced oxidative stress triggered by PM, in turn ameliorated NF-κB pathway and insulin signaling. Gut microbiota may mediate the actions of HT.Copyright © 2019.

These patients demonstrate increased cholesterol synthesis and hepatic . These lipid disturbances may be due to a decreased concentration of the bile acid pool or malabsorption. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the effect of bile acid administration on lipid synthesis in patients with SBS.The 24 h fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of cholesterol and triglycerides was measured by the isotopic method (deuterated water) before and after 4 months of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment (20 mg/kg/day). Five short bowel patients (age: 53.4 ± 19.2 years) who had normal liver function and lipid plasmatic profiles received 1920 ± 300 ml of PN for 151 ± 74 days (mean PN energy intake was 27.0 ± 6.0 kcal/kg body weight, composed with 3.87 ± 1.38 g/kg of carbohydrate, 0.72 ± 0.25 g/kg of fat and 1.10 ± 0.23 g/kg of amino acids). Plasma metabolites, liver enzymes, 7-α-OH-cholesterol and steatosis levels were also evaluated before and after treatment. Student's t-tests were performed, and the results were expressed in means (±SD).After treatment, decreases in the absolute values of cholesterol synthesis (0.31 ± 0.12 mmol L to 0.24 ± 0.11 mmol L; p < 0.05), FSR of cholesterol (31.6 ± 4.7% to 26.4 ± 4.7%; p = 0.06) and FSR of triglycerides (12.8 ± .8% to 9.2 ± .%; p < 0.01) were observed. Cholesterol and alanine aminotransferase concentrations also decreased (ALT) (p < 0.05). The absolute values of triglyceride synthesis and triglyceride concentrations remained unchanged.In SBS patients, UDCA decreases the hepatic synthesis of triglycerides and cholesterol.

However, the effects of HMF on  remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that HMF inhibits the early stage of  and maturation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. HMF treatment during preadipocyte differentiation for 8 days reduced lipid accumulation in a dose-dependent manner, and the expression levels of key adipogenic transcription factors (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα)) and the lipogenic transcription factor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP1), were lower after the initial 4 days of the differentiation. Moreover, PPARγ expression level was lower even after the initial 2 days, but C/EBPα and SREBP1 expression was not. HMF upregulated the phosphorylation of protein kinase A catalytic subunit α (PKACα), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in 3T3-L1 cells. The phosphorylation of ACC leads to the inhibition of . Furthermore, the induction of phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC by HMF was abolished by RNA interference targeting PKACα. Taken together, our results suggest that HMF might inhibit the early stage of  via the activation of PKA signaling in 3T3-L1 cells.Copyright © 2019.

C57BL/6N mice were fed with normal diet (ND), HFD (40 kcal% fat), or HFD + 0.005% (/) ED for 16 weeks. In HFD-induced obese mice, dietary ED supplementation significantly alleviated dyslipidemia and adiposity by downregulating the expression of -related genes in white adipose tissue (WAT), while enhancing fecal lipid excretion. ED additionally improved hepatic steatosis and decreased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by downregulating the expression of hepatic enzymes and the genes involved in  and upregulating the expression of hepatic fatty acid oxidation-related enzymes and genes. In addition, ED improved insulin resistance (IR) by suppressing hepatic gluconeogenesis, enhancing glucose utilization, and modulating the production and release of two incretin hormones, namely gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).

It showed anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory properties in mice with acute lung injuries and regulated lipid metabolism through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in hepatocytes. However, the effects of licochalcone A on reducing weight gain and improving nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are unclear. Thus, the present study investigated whether licochalcone A ameliorated weight loss and lipid metabolism in the liver of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed an HFD to induce obesity and NAFLD, and then were injected intraperitoneally with licochalcone A. In another experiment, a fatty liver cell model was established by incubating HepG2 hepatocytes with oleic acid and treating the cells with licochalcone A to evaluate lipid metabolism. Our results demonstrated that HFD-induced obese mice treated with licochalcone A had decreased body weight as well as inguinal and epididymal adipose tissue weights compared with HFD-treated mice. Licochalcone A also ameliorated hepatocyte steatosis and decreased liver tissue weight and lipid droplet accumulation in liver tissue. We also found that licochalcone A significantly regulated serum triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and free fatty acids, and decreased the fasting blood glucose value. Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro, licochalcone A significantly decreased expression of the transcription factor of  and fatty acid synthase. Licochalcone A activated the sirt-1/AMPK pathway to reduce fatty acid chain synthesis and increased lipolysis and β-oxidation in hepatocytes.

The anti-obesity activity of FX is well documented, but FX has not been mass-produced or applied extensively or commercially because of limited availability of raw materials and complex extraction techniques. In this study, we investigated the anti-obesity effect of standardized FX powder ( extract (PE)) developed from microalga  as a commercial functional food. The effects of PE on  inhibition in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and anti-obesity in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6J mice were evaluated. PE and FX dose-dependently decreased intracellular lipid contents in adipocytes without cytotoxicity. In HFD-fed obese mice, PE supplementation for six weeks decreased body weight, organ weight, and adipocyte size. In the serum parameter analysis, the PE-treated groups showed attenuation of lipid metabolism dysfunction and liver damage induced by HFD. In the liver, uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) upregulation and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) downregulation were detected in the PE-treated groups. Additionally, micro computed tomography revealed lower fat accumulation in PE-treated groups compared to that in the HFD group.

The current study was designed to identify the estrogen response elements (EREs) in the promoter of  and investigate the role of AQP7 in the regulation of estrogen-induced anti-.  We measured AQP7 expression and intracellular fat accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes either silenced with shRNA or treated with estrogen receptor (ER)-specific antagonists or agonists before exposure to estrogen. EREs were predicted by Bioinformatics, assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation, and verified by luciferase reporter assay.  We found that regulation of AQP7 expression was mainly via ERα, as confirmed by the use of ER selective antagonists and agonists. In addition, the induction of AQP7 expression by estrogen was linked to ER binding with two EREs in the promoter region of . Furthermore, we found that the regulation of  by 17β-estradiol was AQP7 dependent, as evidenced by the increase in fat accumulation after silencing AQP7.  Estrogen induces AQP7 expression by binding EREs in the promoter of the  gene, resulting in fat catabolism of adipocyte.

Recently, the valine catabolite 3-hydroxyisobuterate (3HIB) was shown to promote insulin resistance in skeletal muscle by increasing lipid content in vivo. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanistic effects of 3HIB on skeletal muscle insulin signaling, metabolism, and related gene expression in vitro. Given these previous observations, we hypothesized that 3HIB would depress skeletal muscle metabolism and insulin sensitivity. C2C12 myotubes were treated with 3HIB for up to 48 hours using both physiological (25-100 μmol/L) and supraphysiological ( mmol/L) concentrations. Metabolic gene expression was measured via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, mitochondrial metabolism was measured via O consumption, and glycolytic metabolism was quantified using extracellular acidification rate. Western blot was used to assess insulin sensitivity following insulin stimulation (indicated by phospho-AKT expression). 3HIB did not alter expressional indicators of mitochondrial biogenesis, glycolysis, BCAA catabolism, or . Chronic physiological 3HIB treatment significantly increased peak oxygen consumption, whereas supraphysiological 3HIB treatment suppressed basal and peak mitochondrial and glycolytic metabolism. Both physiological and supraphysiological 3HIB reduced pAkt expression during insulin stimulation. These findings suggest that 3HIB may reduce muscle insulin sensitivity in cultured myotubes, supporting a potentially causal role of 3HIB in the development of insulin resistance in highly metabolic cell types.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Orbital fibroblasts are a key component in GO pathogenesis, which includes inflammation, , hyaluronic acid (HA) secretion, and fibrosis. Macrophages are thought to participate in the immunological stage of GO, but whether they can directly affect the fibroblasts phenotype and modulate disease progression is unknown. We previously showed that GO adipogenic and fibrotic phenotypes could be modelled in a pseudo-physiological 3D environment in vitro. Here, we introduced macrophages in this 3D culture model to investigate role for macrophages in modulating , HA production, and contractility in orbital fibroblasts. Macrophages had a minimal effect on lipid droplet formation in fibroblasts, but significantly increased HA production and cell contractility, suggesting that they may promote the fibrotic phenotype. This effect was found to be mediated at least in part through phosphatidylinositol-4,-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) activation and linked to an increase in actin polymerization and protrusive activity in fibroblasts.

TGRL from subjects consuming a high saturated fat test meal elicited a variable inflammatory response in TNFα-stimulated endothelial cells (EC) that correlated strongly with the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content. This study investigates how the relative abundance of oxygenated metabolites of PUFA, oxylipins, is altered in TGRL postprandially, and how these changes promote endothelial inflammation. Human aortic EC were stimulated with TNFα and treated with TGRL, isolated from subjects' plasma at fasting and 3. hrs postprandial to a test meal high in saturated fat. Endothelial VCAM-1 surface expression stimulated by TNFα provided a readout for atherogenic inflammation. Concentrations of esterified and non-esterified fatty acids and oxylipins in TGRL were quantified by mass spectrometry. Dyslipidemic subjects produced TGRL that increased endothelial VCAM-1 expression by ≥35%, and exhibited impaired fasting  activity and a shift in soluble epoxide hydrolase and lipoxygenase activity. Pro-atherogenic TGRL were enriched in eicosapentaenoic acid metabolites and depleted in esterified C18-PUFA-derived diols. Abundance of these metabolites was strongly predictive of VCAM-1 expression. We conclude the altered metabolism in dyslipidemic subjects produces TGRL with a unique oxylipin signature that promotes a pro-atherogenic endothelial phenotype.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632961>NFκB/Orai1 Facilitates Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress by Oxidative Stress in the Pathogenesis of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) promote  , which caused abnormal hepatic lipid accumulation, by the NFκB-Orai1 pathway. Oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress have been recognized as key mechanisms in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis. Whether Orai1 facilitates ER stress by oxidative stress remains unknown. The rat model of NAFLD was constructed by feeding high-fat diet (HFD). BRL-3A cells were treated with NEFAs, Orai1inhibtor BTP2, NFκB inhibitor wogonin, or small interfering Orai (siOrai) 1, respectively. The content of intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA), indicating oxidative stress, was measured by a spectrophotometer. ER stress major proteins PERK, IRE1, ATF6, CHOP, and GRP78 were quantified using Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses. For the intracellular location of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Orai1 were measured by Western blot and immunofluorescence, and cytosolic Ca was measured by flow cytometry. As we expected, the liver of rats with NAFLD showed lipid droplets in HE and Oil Red O. The decreased GSH and increased MDA were found in rats fed with HFD. ER stress major proteins PERK, IRE1, ATF6, GRP78, and CHOP were significantly increased in the HFD group. In BRL-3A cells, GSH content dramatically decreased from 1 h, MDA content dramatically increased from 3 h, and expression levels of ER stress significantly increased from 3 h by NEFA treatment. Furthermore, cytosolic Ca increased from 0. h by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells. It indicated that NEFAs increased cytosolic Ca to induce oxidative stress, thus ER stress. The content of oxidative stress and ER stress proteins showed the same trends by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells. These effects were reversed by the Orai1 inhibitor BTP2 and the NFκB inhibitor wogonin. Moreover, siOrai1 abrogated NEFAs' influence in BRL-3A cells. Last, ROS was found by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells, and NEFA treatment enhanced the nuclear localization of NF-κB p65 and ORAI1. It was considered that high NEFAs increased cytosolic Ca and enhanced NFκB-dependent SOCE and its moiety protein Orai1 to decrease GSH and thus induced oxidative stress at earlier stages and furthermore tempted ER stress in the pathologic progress of NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Li, Zou, Guo, Zhang, Xia, Zhang, Yang and Xu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880404>Serum-dependent and -independent regulation of PARP2.</a></h2><p>PARP2 belongs to a family of proteins involved in cell differentiation, DNA damage repair, cellular energy expenditure, and chromatin modeling. In addition to these overlapping functions with PARP1, PARP2 participates in spermatogenesis, T-cell maturation, extra-embryonic endoderm formation, , lipid metabolism, and cholesterol homeostasis. Knowledge of the functions of PARP2 is far from complete, and the mechanism(s) by which the gene and protein are regulated are unknown. In this study, we found that two different mechanisms are used in vitro to regulate PARP2 levels. In the presence of serum, PARP2 is degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway; however, when serum is removed or dialyzed with a 3. kDa molecular cut membrane, PARP2 rapidly becomes sodium dodecyl sulphate- and urea-insoluble. Despite the presence of a putative serum response element in the  gene, transcription is not affected by serum deprivation, and PARP2 levels are restored when serum is replaced. The loss of PARP2 affects cell differentiation and gene expression linked to cholesterol and lipid metabolism. These observations highlight the critical roles that PARP2 plays under different physiological conditions, and reveal that PARP2 is tightly regulated by distinct pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284400>Intra-Abdominal Fat Adipocyte Hypertrophy through a Progressive Alteration of Lipolysis and  in Metabolic Syndrome Rats.</a></h2><p>This study evaluates the progressive participation of enzymes involved in lipolysis and , leading to adipocyte hypertrophy in a metabolic syndrome (MS) rat model caused by chronic consumption of 30% sucrose in drinking water. A total of 70 male Wistar rats were divided into two groups: C and MS. Each of these groups were then subdivided into five groups which were sacrificed as paired groups every month from the beginning of the treatment until  months. The intra-abdominal fat was dissected, and the adipocytes were extracted. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), protein kinases A (PKA), and perilipin A expressions were determined. The LPL and HSL activities were evaluated by spectrophotometry. Histological staining was performed in adipose tissue. Significant increases were observed in blood pressure, HOMA-IR, leptin, triglycerides, insulin, intra-abdominal fat, and number of fat cells per field ( = 0.001) and in advanced glycosylation products, adipocyte area, LPL, HSL activities and/or expression ( ≤ 0.01) in the MS groups progressively from the third month onward.  and lipolysis were increased by LPL activity and HSL activity and/or expression. This was associated with hyperinsulinemia and release of non-esterified fatty acids causing a positive feedback loop that contributes to the development of adipocyte hypertrophy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001061>Part 1: A Novel Model for Three-Dimensional Culture of 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes Stimulates Spontaneous Cell Differentiation Independent of Chemical Induction Typically Required in Monolayer.</a></h2><p>Differences in monolayer and three-dimensional (3D) culture systems have been recognized for several years.

Serum selection, lipid volume determination, and cell size are characterized. We conclusively demonstrate  based on a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) detection using immunohistochemistry (IHC) of sections from these 3D cultures.

Using a series of ' deletion promoter plasmids in luciferase reporter assays, we found that the core promoter was 96 base pairs upstream from the transcription initiation site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay combined with a site-directed mutation experiment demonstrated that KLF15 binding to the promoter region drives the  transcription. KLF15 plays an essential role in  and skeletal muscle lipid flux.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism by which these two flavonoids exerted their effect on . The inhibitory effect of kaempferide and DTMC on adipocyte differentiation and their mechanisms involving mitotic clonal expansion (MCE) and apoptosis during the early stage of  were investigated.Confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were induced to differentiate and exposed to the flavonoids during various phases of differentiation. Intracellular lipid accumulation, cell density and expression of the transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins α were assessed using AdipoRed, Oil red O and Western blot assays. Effects of both flavonoids on cell proliferation and apoptosis were also determined by carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester and annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide-staining assays, respectively.Kaempferide and DTMC showed significant, concentration-dependent anti-adipogenic activity and effect on cell density in the early phase of . The expression of the transcription factors seemed to be reduced when the treatment was prolonged or in the early phase of . These flavonoids interrupted MCE via inhibition of preadipocyte proliferation and induction of apoptosis.

BCO1/BCO2 polymorphisms have been associated with variations in plasma carotenoid amounts in both humans and animals.We investigated whether BCX feeding inhibits high refined-carbohydrate diet (HRCD)-induced NAFLD, dependent or independent of BCO1/BCO2.Six-week-old male wild-type (WT) and BCO1-/-/BCO2-/- double knockout (DKO) mice were randomly fed HRCD (66.% of energy from carbohydrate) with or without BCX (10 mg/kg diet) for 24 wk. Pathological and biochemical variables were analyzed in the liver and mesenteric adipose tissues (MATs). Data were analyzed by 2-factor ANOVA.Compared to their respective HRCD controls, BCX reduced hepatic steatosis severity by 33‒43% and hepatic total cholesterol by 43‒70% in both WT and DKO mice (P < 0.01). Hepatic concentrations of BCX, but not retinol and retinyl palmitate, were 33-fold higher in DKO mice than in WT mice (P < 0.001). BCX feeding increased the hepatic fatty acid oxidation protein peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α, and the cholesterol efflux gene ATP-binding cassette transporter5, and suppressed the  gene acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (Acc1) in the MAT of WT mice but not DKO mice (P < 0.05).

The underlying mechanisms on how deltamethrin promotes fat accumulation, however, are unknown. The aim of the current study was therefore to determine the possible mechanisms through which deltamethrin increases fat accumulation in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes and C. elegans. Deltamethrin (10 μM) significantly increased fat accumulation, and the expression of adipogenic regulators, such as CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPα) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). Deltamethrin significantly decreased the phosphorylation of AMP-activated kinase α (AMPKα), while it increased protein expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and C. elegans. The activation of AMPK with -aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) or the inhibition of ER stress with 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) abolished the effects of deltamethrin on .

However, it has recently been suggested that minor fatty acids such as furan fatty acids are needed in combination with DHA and EPA to exert these positive effects of fish and fish oils. Only recently have furan fatty acids become available in quantities that allow the investigation of their biofunctional properties. In this study, the uptake and effect of the furan fatty acid 9-(3-methyl--pentylfuran-2-yl)-nonanoic acid (9M5) as a sole component and in combination with DHA and EPA on  were analyzed using the 3T3-L1 cell model. 9M5 is taken up and metabolized into 7M5, 5M5, and 3M5 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes during a 24-h period as shown with gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Furthermore, 9M5 significantly increased lipid accumulation during the differentiation process of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes. In addition, the combinations of DHA + 9M5 and EPA + DHA + 9M5 also exerted a significant increase compared to control adipocytes. 3T3-L1 cells incubated with 9M5 resulted in an increased protein expression of PPARγ, C/EBPα, FABP4, and adiponectin, although not to the extent that DHA as a sole component or DHA + 9M5 did. Earlier studies have shown that DHA is a natural ligand for PPARγ, thus being a potential alternative to the antidiabetic thiazolidinediones. We show that 9M5 activates a PPARγ-responsive reporter gene and could therefore be a natural ligand for PPARγ.© 2019 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31233683>[Effect of quercetin on the expression of the carbohydrate and lipid metabolism genes in the liver of rats with genetic].</a></h2><p>Quercetin (Q; 3,3',4',,7-pentahydroxyflavone) is considered as a promising component of specialized products for the correction of metabolic disorders in obesity and metabolic syndrome. At the same time, the results of evaluating the clinical efficacy of Q are ambiguous, and the mechanisms of its influence on lipid and carbohydrate-energy metabolism are not well understood.  of the work was to study the effect of quercetin (Q 3,3',4',,7-pentahydroxyflavone) on the expression of key glycolysis and  enzymes' genes in Zucker-Leprfa (Z) rats characterized by hereditary obesity, compared to «wild-type» Wistar (W) rats. . 24 male Z rats and 32 male W rats aged 8-10 weeks were used. Animals of each line were divided into 4 groups of equal numbers. For 62 days the animals of the first groups (controls) received a balanced diet according to AIN93M, the seconds - the same diet with Q added in a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight. Animals of the third groups received a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet (HFCD) with fat 30% by weight and with the replacement of drinking water with a 20% solution of fructose, the fourths groups - the same diet and supplementation with Q. After removing animals from the experiment, expression levels of liver carbohydrate and lipid metabolism genes Khk, Gck, Pklr, Acaca, Fasn, Scd, Srebf1, Mlxipl, Ppara and Pparg were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with reverse transcription using Actb and Gapdh as reference genes. The levels of triglycerides, total and HDL cholesterol, lipolytic activity and immunoreactive leptin were determined in plasma. . When comparing two animal lines, a significantly higher level of expression of Ppara, Pparg, Mlxipl, Acaca, Fasn, Scd was shown in Z rats compared to W rats, which is consistent with the development of dyslipidemia in the first ones and elevated levels of leptin under both types of diets used. The addition of Q caused in W rats a decrease in the expression of Scd, Mlxipl, Khk and Gck, more pronounced on the background of HFCD whereas in Z rats there were no similar effects, or they had the opposite direction. In addition, in Z rats, consumption of Q led to increased expression of Pklr, which was not observed in W rats. . The modulating effect of Q on the expression of key genes of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism enzymes significantly differs in wild-type W rats and mutant Z rats with hereditary obesity, and this difference appears to be potentiated by the consumption of excess fat and fructose.Copyright© GEOTAR-Media Publishing Group.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31259706>In Vitro Investigation of Potential Anti-Diabetic Activity of the Corm Extract of Hypoxis Argentea Harv.

The decreased bone mass and increased marrow fat tissue demonstrated that GC can destroy the normal differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), which accelerates  but not osteogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Ski, an evolutionary conserved protein, is a multifunctional transcriptional regulator that involved in regulating signaling pathways associated with  differentiation, but the concrete function remains unclear. In this work, we first established a methylprednisolone (MPS)-induced osteonecrosis of femoral head (ONFH) rabbit model, in which the expression of Ski, PPAR-γ, and FABP4 was up-regulated compared with control group, and then we induced the isolated BMSCs from rabbit with dexamethasone (Dex) in vitro and the results showed that the Ski expression was up-regulated by Dex in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Therefore, we demonstrated that the expression of Ski was up-regulated in glucocorticoid-related osteonecrosis disease in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, the  differentiation capacity of BMSCs was enhanced after induced by Dex, which was identified by Oil Red O staining, and the up-regulated PPAR-γ and FABP4 expression. To further study the function of Ski in BMSC after induced by Dex, Ski specific small interfering RNA (Ski-siRNA) was used. Results showed that knockdown of Ski obviously decreased  differentiation evident by Oil Red O staining, and the expression of PPAR-γ and FABP4 was down-regulated simultaneously. Collectively, our findings suggest that Ski increased significantly during glucocorticoid-induced adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs, and the expression level was consistent with adipogenic-related proteins including PPAR-γ and FABP4. Based on the above data, we believe that Ski might become a new molecule in the treatment of GC-induced ONFH and our study could provide a basis for further study on the detailed function of Ski in ONFH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31465298>The poly (l-lactid-co-glycolide; PLGA) fiber component of brushite-forming calcium phosphate cement induces the osteogenic differentiation of human adipose tissue-derived stem cells.</a></h2><p>A brushite-forming calcium phosphate cement (CPC) was mechanically stabilized by addition of poly (l-lactid-co-glycolide; PLGA) fibers (≤10% w/w). It proved highly biocompatible and its fiber component enhanced bone formation in a sheep lumbar vertebroplasty model. However, possible effects on the osteogenic differentiation of resident mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) remained unexplored. The present study used a novel approach, simultaneously analyzing the influence of a solid CPC scaffold and its relatively low PLGA proportion (a mimicry of natural bone) on osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic differentiation, as well as the pluripotency of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs). hASCs were cultured on CPC discs with/without PLGA fibers (% and 10%) in the absence of osteogenic medium for 3, 7, and 14 d. Gene expression of osteogenic markers (Runx2, osterix, alkaline phosphatase, collagen I, osteonectin, osteopontin, osteocalcin), chondrogenic markers (collagen II, Sox9, aggrecan), adipogenic markers (PPARG, Leptin, and FABP4), and pluripotency markers (Nanog, Tert, Rex) was analyzed by RT-PCR. The ability of hASCs to synthesize alkaline phosphatase was also evaluated. Cell number and viability were determined by fluorescein diacetate/propidium iodide staining. Compared to pure CPC, cultivation of hASCs on fiber-reinforced CPC transiently induced the gene expression of Runx2 and osterix (day 3), and long-lastingly augmented the expression of alkaline phosphatase (and its enzyme activity), collagen I, and osteonectin (until day 14). In contrast, augmented expression of all chondrogenic, adipogenic, and pluripotency markers was limited to day 3, followed by significant downregulation. Cultivation of hASCs on fiber-reinforced CPC reduced the cell number, but not the proportion of viable cells (viability > 95%). The PLGA component of fiber-reinforced, brushite-forming CPC supports long-lasting osteogenic differentiation of hASCs, whereas chondrogenesis, , and pluripotency are initially augmented, but subsequently suppressed.

In this study, homology model of S1P was created in order to understand the structural basis for S1P inhibition by PF429242 using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation and in silico kinetics studies. PF429242 was docked (GlideScore=-.20 kcal/mol) into the catalytic triad (D218, H249 and S414) and validated (R=0.5686). The reversible binding kinetic parameter (K/K) was estimated at=7.28E- M with fully bound and apo-states interspersed by 3 transient ligand-bound states with unique binding signatures; water plays a major role in PF429242 dissociation from the catalytic site. Communication between key catalytic triad residues is altered in the presence of PF429242. In apo-S1P state, S414-S307/V216-D218 is the preferred route but in PF429242-bound state, S414-S417/V216-D218 is preferred. Communication between S414 and H249 is also shortened in PF429242 bound state; here, only L410 is required unlike apo-state, which requires P418, V256 and F252. Ligand binding did not alter the communication route between S414 and H249 as both recruited D244 and G220. In conclusion, PF429242 binds tightly but reversible to S1P and the details of this interaction has been presented to guide future efforts at developing novel inhibitors.

Recent studies have shown that -methyladenosine (mA) methylation, one of the most prevalent epigenetic modifications, is involved in the development process. However, whether it plays roles in BMSC differentiation is still elusive. Here, we found that the deletion of mA "writer" protein methyltransferase-like (METTL)3 in porcine BMSCs (pBMSCs) could promote  and janus kinase (JAK)1 protein expression  an mA-dependent way. Knockdown of METTL3 decreased mRNA mA levels of JAK1, leading to enhanced YTH mA RNA binding protein 2 (YTHDF2)-dependent JAK1 mRNA stability. We further demonstrated that JAK1 activated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)  through regulation of its phosphorylation to bind to the promoter of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) β, which could ultimately lead to a modulated adipogenic process.

Carcass traits and lipogenic enzyme activities and gene expression levels in muscles and adipose tissue were investigated in Iberian (fatty) and Landrace × Large White (LDW) pigs under identical feeding level (based on body weight (BW)) and management conditions. Twenty-eight barrows of 10 kg initial BW, 14 per breed, were fed two isoproteic (200 g CP /kg DM) and isocaloric (14.7 MJ metabolizable energy/kg DM) diets with identical composition except for the lysine content (1.09% for diet adequate in lysine and 0.52% for diet deficient in lysine). At a BW of 25 kg, pigs were slaughtered. Compared with pigs fed the lysine-adequate diet, in both genotypes lysine-deficient diet led to lower carcass protein concentration, lower relative proportions of leaner components (loin, ham and shoulder; P < 0.01), and higher carcass fatty components and carcass lipid concentration (P < 0.001).

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of overexpression SREBP1a, a potent activator of all SREBP-responsive genes, on the intermediary metabolism of , a glucose-intolerant carnivorous fish. Administration of chitosan-tripolyphosphate nanoparticles complexed with a plasmid driving expression of the N-terminal transactivation domain of SREBP1a significantly increased SREBP1a mRNA and protein in the liver of . Overexpression of SREBP1a enhanced the hepatic expression of key genes in glycolysis-gluconeogenesis (glucokinase and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase), fatty acid synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2), elongation (elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein ) and desaturation (fatty acid desaturase 2) as well as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate production (glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase) and cholesterol synthesis (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase), leading to increased blood triglycerides and cholesterol levels. Beyond reporting the first study addressing in vivo effects of exogenous SREBP1a in a glucose-intolerant model, our findings support that SREBP1a overexpression caused multigenic effects that favoured hepatic glycolysis and  and thus enabled protein sparing by improving dietary carbohydrate conversion into fatty acids and cholesterol.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551934>High Glucose Level Impairs Human Mature Bone Marrow Adipocyte Function Through Increased ROS Production.</a></h2><p>Bone marrow adipocytes (BMAds) accumulate in aging, menopause, and metabolic diseases such as Type 2 diabetes. These osteoporotic conditions are associated with oxidative stress and hyperglycemia which are both considered as critical factors underlying bone fragility. Glucose excess and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to favor  over osteoblastogenesis. In this study, we investigated whether high glucose exposure could determine dysfunction of mature BMAds, specifically through ROS production. The effects of low (LG,  mM) or high glucose (HG, 25 mM) concentrations were examined using human bone mesenchymal stromal cells (hBMSCs) in the time course of differentiation, and, up to 21 days once adipocytes were mature. HG did not alter the adipocyte differentiation process of hBMSCs. Yet, after 21 days under HG exposure, , and adiponectin mRNA expressions were decreased. These alterations were also observed following adipogenic inducer withdrawal as well as in adipocytes fully differentiated in LG then cultured in HG for the last 11 days. Without inducers, HG condition also led to decreased leptin mRNA level. Importantly, intracellular and extracellular ROS concentrations measured using Amplex Red were significantly raised by 50% under HG exposure. This rise was observed once adipocytes ended differentiation and was reproduced within the different cell culture settings without any cytotoxicity. Among genes involved in ROS metabolism, the mRNA level of the HO generating enzyme NOX4 was found upregulated in the presence of HG. Following cell separation, mature BMAds were shown to overproduce ROS and to display the gene alterations in contrast to non-lipid-laden cells. Finally, a non-lethal treatment with a pro-oxidant agent under LG condition reduces the mRNA levels of , adiponectin, and leptin as the HG condition does in the absence of inducers, and amplifies the effect of glucose excess on gene expression. HG concentration drives mature BMAds toward altered expression of the main adipokines and transcriptional factors. These perturbations are associated with a rise in ROS generation likely mediated through enhanced expression of . Mature BMAds are thus responsive to changes in glucose and ROS concentrations, which is relevant regarding with their phenotype and function in age- or metabolic disease-related osteoporosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31382089>Effects of photoperiod on growth, lipid metabolism and oxidative stress of juvenile gibel carp (Carassius auratus).</a></h2><p>A 58-day cultivation experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of photoperiods on growth, lipid metabolism and oxidative stress of juvenile gibel carp.

The light intensity was 1.02 μmol·m·s (at the tank bottom in a 0.-m water depth). The fish were fed to satiety three times daily (8:30, 14:30 and 18:30). At the end of the experiment, final body weight, specific growth rate, feed efficiency and feed intake were significantly higher in 16L:8D, 20L:4D and 24L:0D groups than those in other groups (P < 0.05). Long-day photoperiods (16L:8D, 20L:4D and 24L:0D) simultaneously promoted , lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. The increases in lipid retention efficiency, whole body lipid concentration and liver lipid content (P < 0.05) indicated that  exceeded fatty acid oxidation. Liver oxidative stress was induced in juvenile gibel carp by short day lengths. The hepatic total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and the contents of metabolite glutathione were the highest in the short-day-length groups (0L:24D, 4L:20D and 8L:16D) (P < 0.05).

Differences between baseline and two follow-up points (initial stimulation- and subsequent early suppression phase) in the biphasic ovarian hormone response to GnRHa were assessed using linear mixed effects models.Genome-wide analysis revealed 588 probes differentially expressed from GnRHa intervention to first stimulatory phase follow-up (intervention group × time) after 10% fdr multiple testing correction. Of these, 54% genes were also significantly associated with estradiol changes over time (proxy for GnRHa response magnitude), 9.% were associated with changes in depressive symptoms, and 38% were associated with changes in neocortical serotonin transporter binding.

In this study, the anti-adipogenic effect of cyanidin-3--galactoside-enriched  m extract (AM-Ex) and its underlying mechanisms were investigated in an in vivo system. Five-week-old male C57BL/6N mice were randomly divided into five groups for 8-week feeding with a control diet (CD), a high-fat diet (HFD), or a HFD with 50 (AM-Ex 50), 100 (AM-Ex 100), or 200 AM-Ex (AM-Ex 200) mg/kg body weight/day. HFD-fed mice showed a significant increase in body weight compared to the CD group, and AM-Ex dose-dependently inhibited this weight gain. AM-Ex significantly reduced the food intake and the weight of white fat tissue, including epididymal fat, retroperitoneal fat, mesenteric fat, and inguinal fat. Treatment with AM-Ex (50 to 200 mg/kg) reduced serum levels of leptin, insulin, triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that AM-Ex suppressed  by decreasing CCAAT/enhancer binding protein , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor , sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, ATP-citrate lyase, fatty acid synthase, and adipocyte protein 2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions.

Here, we discovered its hepatoprotective effects in a mouse model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by ameliorating liver lipid accumulation.Male C57BL/6J mice were fed with a high-fat/high-fructose (HFHFr) diet for 29 weeks to induce the pathological phenomena of NAFLD. Then the mice were treated with LLDT-8 (0.5mg/kg and 1mg/kg) or Vehicle for 8 weeks. Finally, the serum biochemical indexes, liver histological features, fatty acids (FAs) profile and related gene expression in liver were detected to investigate the effect of LLDT-8 on lipid accumulation and its possible mechanism.LLDT-8 treatment significantly inhibited hepatic injury featured by the decrease of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), the lessening of hepatic ballooning and macrovesicular steatosis. Moreover, LLDT-8 could downregulate the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), which further led to the lower ratios of C16:1/C16:0 and C18:1/C18:0 and thus inhibited lipid synthesis. LLDT-8 treatment also could upregulate liver peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a), peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (Acox1), long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Acadl) and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Acadm) expression levels involved in fatty acids oxidation (FAO) and markedly promoted lipolysis.Our results provide a novel application of LLDT-8 in improving NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether pterostilbene improves this hepatic alteration in Zucker (/) rats. Animals were distributed in two experimental groups ( = 10) and fed a standard laboratory diet. Rats in the pterostilbene group were given a dose of 30 mg/kg body weight/d for six weeks. After sacrifice, serum glucose, transaminase, and insulin concentrations were quantified and the liver triacylglycerol content and fatty acid profile was analyzed. Different pathways of triacylglycerol metabolism in liver were studied, including fatty acid synthesis and oxidation, triglyceride assembly, fatty acid uptake, and glucose uptake. With pterostilbene administration, a reduction in insulin concentrations (consequently in the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)) and hepatic triacylglycerol content were observed. No effects were observed in pterostilbene-treated rats in the activity of   enzymes. An improvement in the fatty acid profile was observed in pterostilbene-treated rats. In conclusion, pterostilbene is a useful molecule to reduce liver steatosis. Its delipidating effect is due, at least in part, to reduced fatty acid availability and triacylglycerol synthesis, as well as to an increased very low-density lipoprotein assembly and fatty acid oxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31487963>Function and Transcriptional Regulation of Bovine  Gene in Adipocytes: Roles of , ,  and .</a></h2><p>The TORC2 gene is a member of the transducer of the regulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein gene family, which plays a key role in metabolism and .

Because of the reported adverse effects of CLA on insulin sensitivity in some mouse studies, we sought to compare the impact of dietary t10c12-CLA and c9t11-CLA on liver, adipose tissue, and systemic metabolism of adult lean mice. We fed 8 week-old C57Bl/6J male mice with low fat diets (10.% Kcal from fat) containing 0.8% t10c12-CLA or c9t11-CLA for 9 or 38 days. Diets containing c9t11-CLA had minimal impact on the endpoints studied. However, 7 days after starting the t10c12-CLA diet, we observed a dramatic reduction in fat mass measured by NMR spectroscopy, which interestingly rebounded by 38 days. This rebound was apparently due to a massive accumulation of lipids in the liver, because adipose tissue depots were visually undetectable. Hepatic steatosis and the disappearance of adipose tissue after t10c12-CLA feeding was associated with elevated plasma insulin levels and insulin resistance, compared to mice fed a control diet or c9t11-CLA diet. Unexpectedly, despite being insulin resistant, mice fed t10c12-CLA had normal levels of blood glucose, without signs of impaired glucose clearance. Hepatic gene expression and fatty acid composition suggested enhanced hepatic de novo  without an increase in expression of gluconeogenic genes. These data indicate that dietary t10c12-CLA may alter hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism indirectly, in response to the loss of adipose tissue in mice fed a low fat diet.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The activation of AMPK through phosphorylation is a well-known process; however, activation alone is not sufficient, and knowledge about the other regulatory networks of post-translational modifications connecting the activities of AMPK to systemic metabolic syndromes is important, which is still lacking. The recent studies on Makorin Ring Finger Protein 1 (MKRN1) mediating the ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of AMPK( implicate that the post-translational modification of AMPK, regulating its protein homeostasis, could impose significant systemic metabolic effects (Lee . Nat Commun 9:3404). In this study, MKRN1 was identified as a novel E3 ligase for both AMPKα1 and α2. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts, genetically deleted for , and  and , became stabilized with the suppression of  pathways and an increase in nutrient consumption and mitochondria regeneration. Of note, the  knockout mice fed normal chow displayed no obvious phenotypic defects or abnormality, whereas the -null mice exhibited strong tolerance to metabolic stresses induced by high-fat diet (HFD). Thus, these mice, when compared with the HFD-induced wild type, were resistant to obesity, diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Interestingly, in whole-body  knockout mouse, only the liver and white and brown adipose tissues displayed anincrease in the active phosphorylated AMPK levels, but no other organs, such as the hypothalamus, skeletal muscles, or pancreas, displayed such increases. Specific ablation of MKRN1 in the mouse liver using adenovirus prevented HFD-induced lipid accumulation in the liver and blood, implicating MKRN1 as a possible therapeutic target for metabolic syndromes, such as obesity, type II diabetes, and fat liver diseases.

In addition, pro-lipolytic ser HSL phosphorylations and protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation of PLIN1 (Perilipin-1) increased.

Finally GCs reduced insulin receptor phosphorylation, and Akt protein levels.High dose GC administration to humans leads to pro-lipolytic alterations of CGI-58, G0S2 and ANGPTL4 mRNA transcripts, increases PKA signaling to lipolysis and inhibits the insulin signal in adipose tissue. The increased CIDE-A and CIDE-C mRNA levels suggest concomitant stimulation of lipolysis and lipid storage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, transcriptional dynamic regulation of adipose differentiation driven by complex signal cascades remains largely unexplored in this model. This study aimed to explore adipogenic transcriptional dynamics before (proliferation) and after (differentiation) initial preadipocyte differentiation in ducks.Exogenous oleic acid alone successfully induced duck subcutaneous preadipocyte differentiation. We explored 36 mRNA-seq libraries in order to study transcriptome dynamics during proliferation and differentiation processes at 6 time points. Using robust statistical analysis, we identified 845, 652, 359, 2401 and 1933 genes differentially expressed between -48 h and 0 h, 0 h and 12 h, 12 h and 24 h, 24 h and 48 h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively (FDR < 0.05, FC > 1.). At the proliferation stage, proliferation related pathways and basic cellular and metabolic processes were inhibited, while regulatory factors that initiate differentiation enter the ready-to-activate state, which provides a precondition for initiating adipose differentiation. According to weighted gene co-expression network analysis, pathways positively related to adipogenic differentiation are significantly activated at the differentiation stage, while WNT, FOXO and other pathways that inhibit preadipocyte differentiation are negatively regulated. Moreover, we identified and classified more than 100 transcription factors that showed significant changes during differentiation, and found novel transcription factors that were not reported to be related to preadipoctye differentiation. Finally, we manually assembled a proposed regulation network model of subcutaneous preadipocyte differentiation base on the expression data, and suggested that E2F1 may serve as an important link between the processes of duck subcutaneous preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation.For the first time we comprehensively analyzed the transcriptome dynamics of duck subcutaneous preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation.

NAFLD-which can develop into liver fibrosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma-is defined as an excess accumulation of fat caused by abnormal lipid metabolism and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in hepatocytes. Recently, we reported that Peroxiredoxin  (Prx5) plays an essential role in regulating  and suggested the need to further investigation on the potential curative effects of Prx5 on obesity-induced fatty liver disease. In the present study, we focused on the role of Prx5 in fatty liver disease. We found that Prx5 overexpression significantly suppressed cytosolic and mitochondrial ROS generation. Additionally, Prx5 regulated the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway and lipogenic gene (sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 and FAS) expression; it also inhibited lipid accumulation, resulting in the amelioration of free fatty acid-induced hepatic steatosis. Silence of Prx5 triggered de novo  and abnormal lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Concordantly, Prx5 knockout mice exhibited a high susceptibility to obesity-induced hepatic steatosis. Liver sections of Prx5-deletion mice fed on a high-fat diet displayed Oil Red O-stained dots and small leaky shapes due to immoderate fat deposition. Collectively, our findings suggest that Prx5 functions as a protective regulator in fatty liver disease and that it may be a valuable therapeutic target for the management of obesity-related metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

According to a 6 × 6 Latin square design, 6 rumen-fistulated second-lactation Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (97 ± 13 d in milk) were abomasally infused with saline (LMP-C); isoenergetic infusions (digestible energy basis) of 1,319 g/d glucose (LMP-GG), 676 g/d palm olein (LMP-LG), or 844 g/d essential AA (EAA; HMP-C); or isoenergetic infusions of 1,319 g/d glucose + 844 g/d EAA (HMP-GG) or 676 g/d palm olein + 844 g/d EAA (HMP-LG). Each experimental period consisted of  d of continuous infusion followed by 2 d of rest. A total mixed ration (42% corn silage, 31% grass silage, and 27% concentrate on a dry matter basis) formulated to meet 100 and 83% of net energy and metabolizable protein requirements, respectively, was fed at 90% of ad libitum intake by individual cow. Arterial and venous blood samples were collected on d  of each period. Infusing GG or LG at the HMP level did not affect milk yield or composition differently than at the LMP level. Neither GG nor LG infusion stimulated milk protein or lactose yield, but fat yield tended to decrease with GG and tended to increase with LG. Infusion of GG increased arterial plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin and decreased concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), nonesterified fatty acids, long-chain fatty acids (LCFA), total AA, EAA, and group 2 AA. Infusion of LG increased arterial triacylglycerides (TAG) and LCFA but did not affect EAA concentrations. Compared with the LMP level, the HMP level increased arterial concentrations of BHB, urea, and all EAA groups and decreased the concentration of total non-EAA. Mammary plasma flow increased with GG and was not affected by LG or protein level. Uptake and clearance of total EAA and group 2 AA were affected or tended to be affected by GG × AA interactions, with their uptakes being lower and their clearances higher with GG, but only at the LMP level. Infusion of LG did not affect uptake or clearance of any AA group. The HMP level increased uptake and decreased clearance of all EAA groups and decreased non-EAA uptake. Infusion of GG tended to increase mammary glucose uptake, and tended to decrease BHB uptake only at the LMP level. Infusion of LG increased mammary uptake of TAG and LCFA and increased or tended to increase clearance of TAG and LCFA. We suspect GG increased mammary plasma flow to maintain intramammary energy and AA balance and stimulated  in adipose, accounting for depressed arterial BHB and group 2 AA concentrations. Mammary glucose uptake did not cover estimated requirements for lactose and fat synthesis at the HMP level, except during HMP-GG infusion. Results of this study illustrate flexibility in mammary metabolite utilization when absorptive supply of glucogenic, lipogenic, and aminogenic substrate is increased.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Interactions between topologically associating domains (TADs) and between chromatin and the nuclear lamina organize and position chromosomes in the nucleus. However, how these genomic organizers together shape genome architecture is unclear. Here, using a dual-lineage differentiation system, we report long-range TAD-TAD interactions that form constitutive and variable TAD cliques. A differentiation-coupled relationship between TAD cliques and lamina-associated domains suggests that TAD cliques stabilize heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery. We also provide evidence of dynamic TAD cliques during mouse embryonic stem-cell differentiation and somatic cell reprogramming and of inter-TAD associations in single-cell high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data. TAD cliques represent a level of four-dimensional genome conformation that reinforces the silencing of repressed developmental genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31004409>Adipose Tissue CTGF Expression is Associated with Adiposity and Insulin Resistance in Humans.</a></h2><p>Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is an important regulator of fibrogenesis in many organs. This study evaluated the interrelationship among adipose tissue CTGF expression, fat mass, and insulin resistance in humans.This study examined (1) CTGF gene expression in human subcutaneous preadipocytes before and after inducing ; (2) relationships among abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue CTGF gene expression, body fat mass, and indices of insulin sensitivity, including the hepatic insulin sensitivity index and the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure in conjunction with stable isotope glucose tracer infusion, in 72 people who had marked differences in adiposity and insulin sensitivity; (3) localization of CTGF protein in subcutaneous adipose tissue; and (4) effect of progressive (%, 11%, and 16%) weight loss on adipose tissue CTGF gene expression.CTGF was highly expressed in preadipocytes, not adipocytes. Adipose tissue CTGF expression was strongly correlated with body fat mass and both skeletal muscle and liver insulin sensitivity, and CTGF-positive cells were predominantly found in areas of fibrosis. Progressive weight loss caused a stepwise decrease in adipose tissue CTGF expression.It was concluded that increased CTGF expression is associated with adipose tissue expansion, adipose tissue fibrosis, and multi-organ insulin resistance in people with obesity.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31173642>Parathyroid Hormone Shifts Cell Fate of a Leptin Receptor-Marked Stromal Population from Adipogenic to Osteoblastic Lineage.</a></h2><p>Intermittent parathyroid hormone (iPTH) treatment induces bone anabolic effects that result in the recovery of osteoporotic bone loss. Human PTH is usually given to osteoporotic patients because it induces osteoblastogenesis. However, the mechanism by which PTH stimulates the expansion of stromal cell populations and their maturation toward the osteoblastic cell lineage has not be elucidated. Mouse genetic lineage tracing revealed that iPTH treatment induced osteoblastic differentiation of bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MSPCs), which carried the leptin receptor (LepR)-Cre. Although these findings suggested that part of the PTH-induced bone anabolic action is exerted because of osteoblastic commitment of MSPCs, little is known about the in vivo mechanistic details of these processes. Here, we showed that LepR MSPCs differentiated into type I collagen (Col1) mature osteoblasts in response to iPTH treatment. Along with osteoblastogenesis, the number of Col1 mature osteoblasts increased around the bone surface, although most of them were characterized as quiescent cells. However, the number of LepR-Cre-marked lineage cells in a proliferative state also increased in the vicinity of bone tissue after iPTH treatment. The expression levels of SP7/osterix (Osx) and Col1, which are markers for osteoblasts, were also increased in the LepR MSPCs population in response to iPTH treatment. In contrast, the expression levels of Cebpb, Pparg, and Zfp467, which are adipocyte markers, decreased in this population. Consistent with these results, iPTH treatment inhibited -fluorouracil- or ovariectomy (OVX)-induced LepR MSPC-derived  in BM and increased LepR MSPC-derived osteoblasts, even under the adipocyte-induced conditions. Treatment of OVX rats with iPTH significantly affected the osteoporotic bone tissue and expansion of the BM adipose tissue. These results indicated that iPTH treatment induced transient proliferation of the LepR MSPCs and skewed their lineage differentiation from adipocytes toward osteoblasts, resulting in an expanded, quiescent, and mature osteoblast population.© 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31000692>Nicotinamide mononucleotide promotes osteogenesis and reduces  by regulating mesenchymal stromal cells via the SIRT1 pathway in aged bone marrow.</a></h2><p>Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can differentiate to various cell types including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. This cellular flexibility contributes to widespread clinical use of MSCs in tissue repair. However, challenges remain in efficient cellular expansion of MSCs for stem cell therapy. Current MSC culture methods have resulted in reduced self-renewal of MSCs and compromised therapeutic outcomes. This study identifies that nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a key natural NAD intermediate, effectively encourages MSC expansion in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro expanded MSCs had heightened osteogenesis, but reduced . Furthermore, NMN supplementation stimulated osteogenesis of endogenous MSCs, and protected bone from aging and irradiation induced damage in mice. Mechanistically, we found that NMN treatment upregulated SIRT1. Genetically overexpressing SIRT1 in MSCs by using Prx1 cre; ColA1 mice promoted osteogenesis and reduced  in aged mice.

The purpose of this study is to elucidate the expression profiles of these -related genes after rotator cuff detachment and reattachment in a rabbit model.We investigated gene expression profiles of PPARγ, C/EBPα, and wnt10b in different parts of rabbit supraspinatus (SSP) muscle after tendon detachment ( = 6 for each time point). In addition, we assessed expression of the same genes after SSP reattachment with different intervals from initial detachment ( = 6). Fatty degeneration of the SSP muscle was examined by Oil red-O staining. Gene expression profiles were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.After SSP detachment, Oil red-O-positive oil deposits increased after 3 weeks. In the SSP reattachment model, numerous Oil red-O-positive cells were present at -week reattachment, following 2- and 3-week detachment. PPARγ and C/EBPα messenger ribonucleic acid expression exhibited a significant increase at 2 and 3 weeks after SSP detachment and remained increased at -week reattachment after 2- and 3-week detachment. A decreased expression of wnt10b was observed from 1 week after SSP detachment. Expression of wnt10b was recovered not in the central area of the SSP muscle but in the periphery after reattachment. Adipogenic change was not observed when SSP tendon was reattached after 1-week detachment.These results may suggest that once the adipogenic transcription factors, PPARγ and C/EBPα, were elevated, repair surgery after rotator cuff tear could not prevent the emergence of fat in the SSP muscle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30932968>Micro-PET imaging of [18F]fluoroacetate combined with [18F]FDG to differentiate chronic Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection from an acute bacterial infection in a mouse model: a preliminary study.</a></h2><p>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) infection is one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide and is responsible for 1.7 million deaths per year. The increase in multidrug-resistant TB poses formidable challenges to the global control of tuberculosis. TB infection could easily yield false-positive results in fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ([F]FDG) PET imaging for cancer detection because of its high [F]FDG uptake. We describe the combined [F]FDG PET with fluorine-18-fluoroacetate ([F]FAC), a promising analog of carbon-11-acetate, for targeting glycolysis and de novo , respectively, to determine the metabolic differences between chronic TB infection and acute infection.Six-month-old BALB/c mice were inoculated with Mycobacterium bovis to induce chronic TB infection, and Escherichia coli as well as Staphylococcus aureus to induce acute infection for an in-vivo imaging study. Eighteen days after inoculation for chronic TB infection and  days for acute infection, both [F]FDG and [F]FAC micro-PET were performed on the infected mice. Analysis of variance and the Tukey honest ad-hoc test were carried out to determine differences among treatment with different bacterial infections.TB infection showed much lower [F] FAC accumulation than acute infection.

Although anthocyanin-rich extract from black rice (AEBR) was reported to have a beneficial effect on diabetic rats, no studies have been performed on whether black rice anthocyanins are beneficial for diabetic osteoporosis. Therefore, in this study, a streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat model was established to investigate the protective effect of AEBR on diabetes-induced osteoporosis and its possible mechanism. AEBR at three doses (0., 1.0, and 2.0 g kg d) were administered by oral gavage to diabetic rats for 8 weeks. The blood glucose, BMD, bone histomorphometry parameters, serum bone turnover biomarkers, bone marrow adipocyte numbers, as well as osteoprotegerin (OPG), runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX 2), and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κ B ligand (RANKL) protein expression in bone and serum were detected. The results indicated that AEBR dose-dependently decreased the blood glucose, increased the BMD, and decreased the serum bone turnover markers. The bone microstructure and osteoclast numbers in bone tissues returned to normal in the high AEBR dosage group; at the same time, the AEBR dose-dependently suppressed bone marrow . The RUNX 2 as well as the OPG/RANKL ratio in diabetic rats' bone tissues increased significantly in the AEBR treatment group. Our results indicate that AEBR administration can ameliorate bone loss caused by diabetes; this is mainly attributed to its inhibition of bone turnover, suppression of bone marrow , and up-regulation of RUNX 2 and the OPG/RANKL expression ratio.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31265461>Targeted genetic screening in mice through haploid embryonic stem cells identifies critical genes in bone development.</a></h2><p>Mutagenic screening is powerful for identifying key genes involved in developmental processes. However, such screens are successful only in lower organisms. Here, we develop a targeted genetic screening approach in mice through combining androgenetic haploid embryonic stem cells (AG-haESCs) and clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) technology. We produced a mutant semi-cloned (SC) mice pool by oocyte injection of AG-haESCs carrying constitutively expressed Cas9 and an single guide RNA (sgRNA) library targeting 72 preselected genes in one step and screened for bone-development-related genes through skeletal analysis at birth. This yielded 4 genes: Zic1 and Clec11a, which are required for bone development, and Rln1 and Irx5, which had not been previously considered. Whereas Rln1-/- mice exhibited small skeletal size only at birth, Irx5-/- mice showed skeletal abnormalities both in postnatal and adult phases due to decreased bone mass and increased bone marrow . Mechanistically, iroquois homeobox  (IRX5) promotes osteoblastogenesis and inhibits  by suppressing peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) activation.

However, why different diets lead to similar diabetic states despite being associated with different microbiota is not clear. Mice were fed two high-energy diets (HED) with the same energy density but different fat-to-sugar ratios to determine the associations between the microbiota and early-stage metabolic syndrome.

Our study suggests that different metabolic-syndrome-inducing diets may result in different microbiota but similar microbiomes and metabolomes. This suggests that the metagenome and metabolome are crucial for the prognosis and pathogenesis of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Various types of diet can lead to type 2 diabetes. The gut microbiota in type 2 diabetic patients are also different. So, two questions arise: whether there are any commonalities between gut microbiota induced by different pro-obese diets and whether these commonalities lead to disease. Here we found that high-energy diets with two different fat-to-sugar ratios can both cause obesity and prediabetes but enrich different gut microbiota. Still, these different gut microbiota have similar genetic and metabolite compositions. The microbial metabolites in common between the diets modulate lipid accumulation and macrophage inflammation  and  This work suggests that studies that only use 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to determine how the microbes respond to diet and associate with diabetic state are missing vital information.Copyright © 2019 Shan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182929>Taurine Transporter Regulates Adipogenic Differentiation of Human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells through Affecting Wnt/β-catenin Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p>Increased adipocytes are associated with obesity and many human disorders including cancers.

Branched-chain AA (BCAA) supplementation has beneficial effects on body weight, , and insulin resistance in several species. The BCAA are used for milk and body protein synthesis as well as being oxidized by the tricarboxylic acid cycle to produce ATP during catabolic states. The objective was to evaluate the effect of rumen-protected BCAA (375 g of 27% l-Leu, 85 g of 48% l-Ile, and 91 g of 67% l-Val) with or without propylene glycol (PG) oral administration on milk production, dry matter intake, nonesterified fatty acids, β-hydroxybutyrate, and plasma urea nitrogen during the first 35 d in milk (DIM) in dairy cattle. Multiparous Holstein cows were enrolled in blocks of three 28 d before expected calving and assigned randomly to either the control or 1 of 2 treatments. The control (n = 26) received 200 g/d of dry molasses, the BCAA treatment (n = 23) received BCAA mixed with 200 g/d of dry molasses from calving until 35 DIM, and the BCAA plus PG (BCAAPG) treatment (n = 25) received BCAA mixed with 200 g/d of dry molasses from calving until 35 DIM plus 300 mL of PG once daily from calving until 7 DIM.

Placental growth factor is a potent proangiogenic factor that stimulates the formation of mature and durable vessels but is understudied in human diseases. Methods and Results We conducted a prospective case-cohort study of baseline placental growth factor and incident T2DM within the WHS (Women's Health Study). A random sample of incident T2DM cases (n=491) occurring over a 15-year follow-up period was selected and compared with a reference subcohort (n=561). Case subjects were matched to the reference risk set on -year age groups and race. All subjects in this analysis were required to have a hemoglobin A <6.% at WHS enrollment. Median baseline levels of placental growth factor were higher in case subjects compare to the reference subcohort (18.0 pg/mL versus 17.2 pg/mL) but were only weakly correlated with glycemic measures and not associated with obesity. The risk of diabetes mellitus increased across placental growth factor quartile in the base model (hazard ratios, 1.00, 1.14, 1.46, and 2.14; P-trend<0.001) and in multivariable-adjusted models accounting for clinical T2DM risk factors (hazard ratios, 1.00, 1.17, 1.45, and 2.61; P-trend<0.001). These findings were not substantially altered by further adjustment for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, hemoglobin A, or fasting insulin and remained robust in sensitivity analyses excluding those diagnosed within 2 years of enrollment and those with baseline hemoglobin A ≥6.0%. Conclusions Elevated placental growth factor levels are associated with future T2DM independent of traditional risk factors, measures of glycemia, insulin resistance, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. These prospective data suggest that pathologic angiogenesis may occur well before the clinical onset of T2DM and thus may have relevance to vascular complications of this disease.

Biological studies of fish T cells may provide helpful evidence to understand evolution of adaptive immune systems. To this end, using a Nile tilapia () model, we revealed the regulatory mechanism of adaptive immunity mediated by ancestral T cells in jawed fish. Nile tilapia T cells as well as a tightly regulated mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway participate in the cellular adaptive immune response during  infection. Blockade of mTORC1 signaling by rapamycin impairs T cell activation and Ag-induced proliferation in this early vertebrate. More critically, we show that signals from mTORC1 are indispensable for primordial effector T cells to eliminate infection by promoting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, cytotoxic-related molecules, and proapoptotic genes. Mechanistically, teleost mTORC1 directs effector T cell function by coordinating multiple metabolic programs, including glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and  through activating key transcription factors c-Myc, HIF-1α, and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins, and thus links immune signals to metabolic reprogramming in jawed fish. To our knowledge, these results represent the first description of the regulatory mechanism for T cell-mediated adaptive immunity in a fish species. From an evolutionary viewpoint, our study suggests that primordial T cells are armed with sophisticated regulatory strategies like those in modern T cells prior to the divergence of bony fish from the tetrapod lineage. Therefore, our findings fill in an important gap regarding evolution of the adaptive immune system.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31071446>The mitochondrial citrate carrier in Yarrowia lipolytica: Its identification, characterization and functional significance for the production of citric acid.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial citrate carrier plays a central role in exporting acetyl-CoA in the form of citrate from mitochondria to cytosol thereby connecting carbohydrate catabolism and .

Reintroduction of YlYHM2 gene as well as heterologous expression of Aspergillus niger gene AnYHM2 into ΔYlyhm2 strain restored the growth in minimal citrate medium and even enhanced citric acid production by 45% in both variants compared with wild type strain during test tube cultivation. Mitochondrial extracts isolated from YlYHM2 null mutant and wild type strain were incorporated into liposomes; citrate/citrate and α-ketoglutarate/α-ketoglutarate homoexchange activities were reduced by 87% and 40% in ΔYlyhm2 strain, respectively, compared with the wild type, whereas citrate/α-ketoglutarate and α-ketoglutarate/citrate heteroexchanges were decreased by 87% and 95%, respectively. YlYhm2p was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and reconstituted into liposomes. Besides high efficiency to citrate and α-ketoglutarate transport, YlYhm2p also transported oxaloacetate, succinate, fumarate, and to a much lesser extent, aconitate, malate, isocitrate, oxoadipate, and glutamate. The activity of reconstituted YlYhm2p was inhibited strongly by SH-blocking reagents, pyridoxal-'-phosphate, and partly by N-ethylmaleimide. Co-expression of YlYHM2 and adenosine monophosphate deaminase YlAMPD genes resulted in the production of 49.7 g/L of citric acid during test tube cultivation, whereas wild type strain accumulated 30.1 g/L of citric acid. Large-scale cultivation in bioreactor of the engineered strain resulted in 97.1 g/L of citric acid production with a process selectivity of 94.2% and an overall citric acid yield of 0. g/g. The maximal specific rate of citric acid synthesis was 0.93 g/L/h. Therefore, the physiological role of YlYhm2p in glucose-containing medium is to catalyze both import of citrate into mitochondria for catabolic reactions and export of citrate as a source of acetyl-CoA from mitochondria. Possible shuttles for citrate exporting are discussed. Moreover, for the first time evidence has been given for the improvement of TCA cycle intermediate production by manipulation of a gene coding a mitochondrial carrier.Copyright © 2019 International Metabolic Engineering Society.

In the present study, we focus on the study of cell motility at the single-cell level, toward expanding our knowledge regarding the cytoskeleton alteration during differentiation; since-cell motility is mediated by cytoskeletal components. We used the holographic-microscopy live imaging technique to evaluate, for the first time in the literature, differences between the motility of nondifferentiated preadipocytes and differentiated mature adipocytes in living cell cultures over time. We revealed that mean motility speed of preadipocytes was significantly higher (fourfold) than that of adipocytes, and that the movement of preadipocytes is less consistent and more extensive. Furthermore, we found that preadipocytes tend to migrate to farther distances, while mature adipocytes remain relatively close to their original location. The results presented here are in agreement with the fact that the cytoskeleton of adipocytes is altered during differentiation and similarly, points to the fact that the cell-sensing mechanisms are changing during differentiation. Our research paves the way to gain better insights of the differentiation process and its implications on larger scale systems in the context of obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30929597>Efficient bioconversion of enzymatic corncob hydrolysate into biomass and lipids by oleaginous yeast  KM281510.</a></h2><p>This study aims to valorize of enzymatic corncob hydrolysate (ECH) for biomass and lipid productions via microbial bioconversion by the efficient oleaginous yeast  KM281510. Biomass (.63 g/L), lipids (3.29 g/L), and lipid content (58% (g/g)) were observed by batch cultivation in shaking flask. The effect of total sugar concentration in ECH, agitation rate, temperature, and initial pH were investigated in both batch and fed-batch cultivations by shaking flask and 3.0 L airlift bioreactor. Biomass, lipids, and lipid content of 27.77 g/L, 20.27 g/L, and 70% (g/g) were obtained with 100 g/L total sugar (68 g/L glucose, 29 g/L xylose, and 3 g/L arabinose), pH 6., 25 °C, 6.0 vvm, for 7 days by batch cultivation in bioreactor. Surprisingly, production parameters were improved by fed-batch, wherein these promising high biomass (36.06 g/L), lipid production (25.12 g/L), and lipid productivity (2.52 g/L/d) values were achieved. Moreover, fed-batch cultivation promoted the utilization of xylose (2.-times) and arabinose (3.4-times) higher than batch cultivation, achieving lipid content (70% (g/g)) with oleic acid (53%). These results would be helpful for understanding the comprehensive utilization of ECH, especially the pentose sugars, for growth and  of oleaginous yeast as well as being a qualified biodiesel feedstock.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31064103>Fermented  Extract Prevents Hepatosteatosis and Adipocyte Hypertrophy in High Fat Diet-Fed Mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) is characterized by accumulation of lipid droplets in the liver. The objective of this study was to evaluate protective effects of fermented  extract by  ON188 (ONE) against hepatosteatosis and obesity in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed HFD mixed with ONE for four weeks and its effects on hepatosteatosis and obesity were examined. Although ONE did not change food intake, it reduced body weights of mice at administration dose of 200 mg/kg/day. Activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) as plasma parameters were reduced by ONE in a dose-dependent manner. Hepatic lipid droplets and triglyceride (TG) levels were also reduced by ONE due to upregulation of fatty acid oxidizing genes such as carnithine palmitoyltransferase (CPT1) and peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor α(PPARα) mediated by induction of sphingosine kinase 2 (SPHK2). In epididymal fat tissue, sizes of adipocytes were significantly reduced by ONE in a dose-dependent manner. This is mainly due to suppression of  and upregulation of adipocyte browning genes. Collectively, these results suggest that fermented ONE can activate fatty acid oxidation via SPHK2 in the liver. It can also suppress  and activate browning in adipose tissue. Thus, ONE might have potential to be used for the development of functional foods against liver dysfunction and obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149278>THE EFFECTS OF VARIOUS DOSES OF PREDNISOLONE ADMINISTRATION ON SERUM VASPIN LEVELS IN RATS.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the dose-dependent effects of prednisolone administration on serum vaspin levels and correlate this with changes in the BMI and  in rats.Twenty-four albino Wistar male rats weighing between 190-240 g were divided into four groups, three experimental ( mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg prednisolone) and one control. The prednisolone groups were given once-daily doses for 30 days, orally. In addition, the rats were weighed, and their height and waist circumferences were measured once a week. At the end of 30 days, vaspin and glucose levels were measured from blood samples.In the prednisolone groups, the vaspin levels significantly increased when compared with the control group. The control group has a serum vaspin level of 155 ± 20.99 pg/mL and this level has been increased by prednisolone administration in a dose dependent manner. In the prednisolone groups, especially the 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg groups, the glucose levels increased in a dose dependent fashion.Prednisolone administration significantly increased serum glucose and vaspin levels in a dose dependent manner, indicating that the increase in the serum vaspin levels could be related to the increase in the serum glucose concentration. Vaspin can be a molecule that is released in response to increased glucose and can be a rebound defense mechanism to modulate the blood glucose concentration. We suggest vaspin as a potential target for the treatment and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and other metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667457>3-(3-Hydroxyphenyl)-Propionic Acid (PPA) Suppresses Osteoblastic Cell Senescence to Promote Bone Accretion in Mice.</a></h2><p>Phenolic acids (PAs) are metabolites derived from polyphenolic compounds found in fruits and vegetables resulting from the actions of gut bacteria. Previously, we reported that the levels of seven individual PAs were found to be at least 10 times higher in the serum of rats fed a blueberry (BB)-containing diet compared to those fed a control diet. We have characterized the effects of one such BB-associated serum PA, 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid (PPA), on senescence signaling and promotion of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation toward osteoblasts, while suppressing  in the stem cells. To better understand the mechanistic actions of PPA on bone formation in vivo, we administered four doses of PPA (0.1, 0., 1, and  mg/kg/day; daily i.p.) to 1-month-old female C57BL6/J mice for 30 days. We did not observe significant effects of PPA on cortical bone; however, there were significantly higher bone volume and trabecular thickness and increased osteoblastic cell number, but decreased osteoclastic cell number in PPA-treated groups compared to controls. These morphological and cellular outcomes of bone were reflected in changes of bone formation markers in serum and bone marrow plasma. PPA treatment reduced senescence signaling as evaluated by senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, PPARγ, p53, and p21 expression in bone. In conclusion, PPA is capable of altering the mesenchymal stem cell differentiation program and bone cell senescence. This raises the possibility that BB-rich diets promote bone growth through increasing systemic PAs, a question that merits additional investigation. © 2019 The Authors.  published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.© 2019 The Authors.

The underlying causes of autoimmune reaction and its effect on host metabolism remain largely unknown. Herein, we apply lipidomics to elucidate the early events preceding clinical CD in a cohort of Finnish children, followed up in the Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention study.Mass spectrometry-based lipidomics profiling was applied to a longitudinal/prospective series of 233 plasma samples obtained from CD progressors (n = 23) and healthy controls (n = 23), matched for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) risk, sex, and age. The children were followed from birth until diagnosis of clinical CD and subsequent introduction of a gluten-free diet.Twenty-three children progressed to CD at a mean age of 4.8 years. They showed increased amounts of triacylglycerols (TGs) of low carbon number and double bond count and a decreased level of phosphatidylcholines by age 3 months as compared to controls. These differences were exacerbated with age but were not observed at birth (cord blood). No significant differences were observed in the essential TGs.Our preliminary findings suggest that abnormal lipid metabolism associates with the development of clinical CD and occurs already before the first introduction of gluten to the diet. Moreover, our data suggest that the specific TGs found elevated in CD progressors may be due to a host response to compromised intake of essential lipids in the small intestine, requiring de novo .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284705>Probiotics Improve Chemerin Levels and Metabolic Syndrome Parameters in Obese Rats</a></h2><p>Chemerin is a recently discovered adipokine that plays a role in adipocyte metabolism.

To characterize the in vivo function of a novel long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs), loss-of-function assays were performed with slincRAD knockdown mice. Down-regulation of slincRAD expression was found to impair the development of adipose tissue, leading to a slim phenotype for both of the male and female mice. Compared to normal adipocytes, slincRAD knockdown cells had defective differentiation features, such as smaller sizes and decreased lipid production. For elder mice, slincRAD knockdown led to abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism.

Lambs born from ewes supplemented with Ca salts of EPA + DHA, or palm FA distillate (PFAD) high in palmitic and oleic acid at 0.39% DM during the last 50 d of gestation were used. Lambs were weaned at 61 d of age and adapted to a high concentrate diet for 1. mo. After adaptation, 74 lambs (28 pens) were blocked by sex and BW and used in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments using the factors of dam supplementation (DS) and lamb supplementation (LS) of Ca salts of EPA + DHA or PFAD at 1.48% DM. Lambs were slaughtered after 42 d and liver and adipose tissue collected for FA and gene expression analysis. Liver concentrations of EPA and DHA were greater (P < 0.01) with LS of EPA + DHA vs. PFAD during the finishing period. In adipose tissue, a lamb × dam interaction was observed for EPA (P = 0.02) and DHA (P = 0.04); LS of EPA + DHA increased EPA and DHA, but the increase was greatest in lambs born from ewes supplemented with PFAD. No lamb × dam treatment interactions were observed for gene expression in liver tissue (P > 0.10). Hepatic mRNA abundance of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; P = 0.01) was greater in lambs born from EPA + DHA ewes vs. lambs from PFAD ewes. mRNA expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (P < 0.01), fatty acid synthase (P = 0.01), Δ-desaturase (P < 0.01), and Δ6-desaturase (P < 0.01) were decreased in liver of EPA + DHA lambs. A significant lamb × dam diet interaction was observed for elongation of very long chain fatty acid 2 in adipose tissue (P = 0.01); lambs supplemented with the same FA as their dams had lower expression. Expression of HSL tended (P = 0.08) to be decreased in adipose of EPA + DHA lambs born from EPA + DHA ewes. The changes in mRNA expression suggest that  decreased, and lipolysis increased in lamb liver with EPA + DHA vs. PFAD supplementation during the finishing period. In adipose tissue, changes suggest that  decreased in lambs born from EPA + DHA supplemented dams and supplemented with EPA + DHA during the finishing period. In addition, these results suggest an interaction between supplementation of FA to dams during late gestation on lamb response of adipose tissue, but not liver, to FA supplementation during the finishing period.© The Author(s) 2019.

The aims of present study were to evaluate the effects of dietary lipid levels on growth, enzymes activities, and expression of genes of lipid metabolism in hepatopancreas of juvenile swimming crab. Three isonitrogenous diets were formulated to contain crude lipid levels at .8 %, 9.9 % and 15.1 %, respectively. Crabs fed the diet containing 15.1 % lipid had significantly lower weight gain, specific growth rate and survival, and higher feed conversion ratio than those fed the .8 % and 9.9 % lipid diets. Crabs fed .8 % lipid had lower malondialdehyde concentrations in the hemolymph and hepatopancreas than those fed the other diets. Highest glutathione peroxidase in hemolymph and superoxide dismutase in hepatopancreas were observed in crabs fed .8 % lipid. The lowest fatty acid synthase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities in hepatopancreas were observed in crabs fed 15.1 % lipid, whereas crabs fed .8 % lipid had lower carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 activity than those fed the other diets. Crabs fed 15.1 % lipid showed lower hepatopancreas expression of genes involved in LC-PUFA biosynthesis, lipoprotein clearance, fatty acid uptake, fatty acid oxidation, lipid anabolism and lipid catabolism than those fed the other diets, whereas expression of some genes of lipoprotein assembly and fatty acid oxidation were up-regulated compared with crabs fed .8 % lipid. Overall, high dietary lipid level can inhibit growth, reduce feed utilization and reduce antioxidant enzyme activities. Moreover, dietary lipid influenced enzyme activities and gene expression involved in lipid metabolism of juvenile swimming crab.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520202>Inhibition of intestinal lipases alleviates the adverse effects caused by high-fat diet in Nile tilapia.</a></h2><p>Intestinal lipases are fat-digesting enzymes, which play vital roles in lipid absorption in the intestine. To study the regulation of intestinal lipase activity in systemic lipid metabolism in fish, especially in the metabolic diseases caused by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, we inhibited intestinal lipases in Nile tilapia to investigate the physiological consequences. In the present study, Nile tilapia were firstly fed with HFD (12% fat) for 6 weeks to establish a fatty fish model. Afterwards, Orlistat as a potent intestinal lipase inhibitor was added into the HFD for the following -week feeding trial, with two dietary doses (Orlistat16 group, 16 mg/kg body weight; Orlistat32 group, 32 mg/kg body weight). After the trial, both doses of Orlistat treatment significantly reduced intestinal lipase activity, fat absorption, hepatic lipid accumulation, and gene expression of , whereas increased gene expression of lipid catabolism. Moreover, intestinal lipase inhibition increased immune enzyme activities, antioxidant capacity, and gene expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, whereas lowered gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Besides, Orlistat could also improve the structure of the intestine and increase expression of intestinal tight-coupling protein. Taken together, intestinal lipase inhibition alleviated the adverse effects caused by HFD in Nile tilapia. Thus, intestinal lipases played key roles in absorbing dietary lipid and could be a promising target in regulating systemic lipid metabolism in fish.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31394503>Simvastatin downregulates  in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and orbital fibroblasts from Graves´ ophthalmopathy patients.</a></h2><p>Smoking is a strong risk factor for the development of Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO).

The aim of this study was to study the effects of tobacco smoking and simvastatin on preadipocytes and orbital fibroblasts (OFs) in the adipogenic process.Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) was generated by a validated pump system. Mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes or OFs were exposed to 10% CSE with or without simvastatin. Gene expression was studied in preadipocytes and OFs exposed to CSE with or without simvastatin and compared to unexposed cells or cells treated with a differentiation cocktail.In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, Cyr61, Ptgs2, Egr1, and Zfp36 expression levels were at least 3-fold higher in cells exposed to CSE than in unexposed cells. Simvastatin downregulated expression of these genes (1.7-fold, .-fold, 3.3-fold, 1.4-fold). CSE alone could not stimulate preadipocytes to differentiate.

Modern genomics has accelerated IEM discovery, but assessing the impact of genomic variants is still challenging. Here, we integrate genomics and metabolomics to identify a cause of lactic acidosis and epilepsy. The proband is a compound heterozygote for variants in LIPT1, which encodes the lipoyltransferase required for 2-ketoacid dehydrogenase (2KDH) function. Metabolomics reveals abnormalities in lipids, amino acids, and 2-hydroxyglutarate consistent with loss of multiple 2KDHs. Homozygous knockin of a LIPT1 mutation reduces 2KDH lipoylation in utero and results in embryonic demise. In patient fibroblasts, defective 2KDH lipoylation and function are corrected by wild-type, but not mutant, LIPT1 alleles. Isotope tracing reveals that LIPT1 supports  and balances oxidative and reductive glutamine metabolism. Altogether, the data extend the role of LIPT1 in metabolic regulation and demonstrate how integrating genomics and metabolomics can uncover broader aspects of IEM pathophysiology.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

This assay functions well with multiple adipose depots, a previously unattained analysis. To delipidate and facilitate recovery, tissues were homogenized in acetonitrile and the homogenate was frozen. The supernatant was evaporated, resuspended in an aqueous acetate buffer, and extracted with hexane to separate free (unconjugated) from sulfated steroids. Sulfated steroids in the aqueous medium were then hydrolyzed with sulfatase and extracted with hexane. Each extract was analyzed separately. HPLC resolution combined with the sensitivity and specificity of MS/MS allowed quantification of DHEA, E2, and T with 10, 10 and  fmol lower limits of quantification and linear ranges to 1 pmol. Application of the method to mouse serum and tissues reveals ranges of DHEA, E2, and T and their sulfates, and tissue-specific differences in steroid profile, especially white vs brown adipose.

Emerging evidence indicates that exposure to environmental stressors is associated with abnormal foetal development. However, how prenatal exposure to diesel exhaust PM (DEP) predisposes adult offspring to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains unclear. To examine this, C57BL/6J mice were exposed to DEP or a vehicle before conception and during pregnancy and fed normal chow or a high-fat diet. Then, the hepatic fatty accumulation in the adult male offspring and possible molecular mechanisms were assessed. Our data showed that prenatal exposure to DEP on normal chow led to hepatic steatosis in adult male offspring with normal liver function. However, prenatal DEP exposure relieved the hepatic steatosis and liver function in offspring of mice fed a high-fat diet. Furthermore, prenatal exposure to DEP on normal chow increased  and worsened fatty acid oxidation. The counteractive effect of prenatal DEP exposure on high-fat-diet-induced hepatic steatosis was produced through upregulated adenosine '-monophosphate-activated protein kinase, and this improved  and fatty acid oxidation. Collectively, prenatal exposure to DEP programmed the development of NAFLD differently in the adult male offspring of mice fed normal chow and a high-fat diet, showing the pleotrophic effects of exposure to adverse environmental factors in early life.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

EM01 lowered blood glucose levels elevated by the HFD. Lipid profiles were improved following EM01 treatment. Serum adiponectin significantly increased, while leptin, insulin growth factor-1, non-esterified fatty acid, and glucose significantly decreased in the HFD-EM01 group.  and -related genes were suppressed, while fat oxidation-related genes increased following EM01 administration. Thus, EM01 may be a natural anti-obesity agent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597247>The Power of LC-MS Based Multiomics: Exploring Adipogenic Differentiation of Human Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells.</a></h2><p>The molecular study of fat cell development in the human body is essential for our understanding of obesity and related diseases. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) are the ideal source to study fat formation as they are the progenitors of adipocytes. In this work, we used human MSCs, received from surgery waste, and differentiated them into fat adipocytes. The combination of several layers of information coming from lipidomics, metabolomics and proteomics enabled network analysis of the biochemical pathways in . Simultaneous analysis of metabolites, lipids, and proteins in cell culture is challenging due to the compound's chemical difference, so most studies involve separate analysis with unimolecular strategies. In this study, we employed a multimolecular approach using a two-phase extraction to monitor the crosstalk between lipid metabolism and protein-based signaling in a single sample (~10 cells). We developed an innovative analytical workflow including standardization with in-house produced C isotopically labeled compounds, hyphenated high-end mass spectrometry (high-resolution Orbitrap MS), and chromatography (HILIC, RP) for simultaneous untargeted screening and targeted quantification. Metabolite and lipid concentrations ranged over three to four orders of magnitude and were detected down to the low fmol (absolute on column) level. Biological validation and data interpretation of the multiomics workflow was performed based on proteomics network reconstruction, metabolic modelling (MetaboAnalyst 4.0), and pathway analysis (OmicsNet). Comparing MSCs and adipocytes, we observed significant regulation of different metabolites and lipids such as triglycerides, gangliosides, and carnitine with 113 fully reprogrammed pathways. The observed changes are in accordance with literature findings dealing with adipogenic differentiation of MSC. These results are a proof of principle for the power of multimolecular extraction combined with orthogonal LC-MS assays and network construction. Considering the analytical and biological validation performed in this study, we conclude that the proposed multiomics workflow is ideally suited for comprehensive follow-up studies on  and is fit for purpose for different applications with a high potential to understand the complex pathophysiology of diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31032430>Acute fructose intake suppresses fasting-induced hepatic gluconeogenesis through the AKT-FoxO1 pathway.</a></h2><p>Excessive intake of fructose increases  in the liver, leading to hepatic lipid accumulation and development of fatty liver disease. Metabolic alterations in the liver due to fructose intake have been reported in many studies, but the effect of fructose administration on hepatic gluconeogenesis is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute effects of fructose administration on fasting-induced hepatic gluconeogenesis. C57BL/6J mice were administered fructose solution after 14 h of fasting and plasma insulin, glucose, free fatty acids, and ketone bodies were analysed. We also measured phosphorylated AKT and forkhead box O (FoxO) 1 protein levels and gene expression related to gluconeogenesis in the liver. Furthermore, we measured glucose production from pyruvate after fructose administration. Glucose-administered mice were used as controls. Fructose administration enhanced phosphorylation of AKT in the liver, without increase of blood insulin levels. Blood free fatty acids and ketone bodies concentrations were as high as those in the fasting group after fructose administration, suggesting that insulin-induced inhibition of lipolysis did not occur in mice administered with fructose. Fructose also enhanced phosphorylation of FoxO1 and suppressed gluconeogenic gene expression, glucose-6-phosphatase activity, and glucose production from pyruvate. The present study suggests that acute fructose administration suppresses fasting-induced hepatic gluconeogenesis in an insulin-independent manner.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31351846>Molecular modelling, synthesis, and biological evaluations of a 3,-disubstituted isoxazole fatty acid analogue as a PPARα-selective agonist.</a></h2><p>The peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) are important drug targets in treatment of metabolic and inflammatory disorders. Fibrates, acting as PPARα agonists, have been widely used lipid-lowering agents for decades. However, the currently available PPARα targeting agents show low subtype-specificity and consequently a search for more potent agonists have emerged. In this study, previously isolated oxohexadecenoic acids from the marine algae Chaetoceros karianus were used to design a PPARα-specific analogue. Herein we report the design, synthesis, molecular modelling studies and biological evaluations of the novel 3,-disubstituted isoxazole analogue 6-(-heptyl-1,2-oxazol-3-yl)hexanoic acid (1), named ADAM. ADAM shows a clear receptor preference and significant dose-dependent activation of PPARα (EC = 47 µM) through its ligand-binding domain (LBD). Moreover, ADAM induces expression of important PPARα target genes, such as CPT1A, in the Huh7 cell line and primary mouse hepatocytes. In addition, ADAM exhibits a moderate ability to regulate PPARγ target genes and drive . Molecular modelling studies indicated that ADAM docks its carboxyl group into opposite ends of the PPARα and -γ LBD. ADAM interacts with the receptor-activating polar network of amino acids (Tyr501, His447 and Ser317) in PPARα, but not in PPARγ LBD. This may explain the lack of PPARγ agonism, and argues for a PPARα-dependent adipogenic function. Such compounds are of interest towards developing new lipid-lowering remedies.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Obesity, a feature of excess accumulation of white adipocytes in a body, is one of the risk factors for onset of various diseases in dogs. As the first step to explore adipose genes related to dog obesity, we examined relationships among mRNA levels of putative molecules related to  and function of adipocytes in fat of hospitalized dogs. Gonadal adipose tissues were collected from a total of 29 dogs, and the gene expression levels were examined by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The multicollinearity analysis revealed that body condition score (BCS), which reflects adiposity, did not correlate with expression levels of any genes but correlated with age of dog. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway stimulates not only commitment of mesenchymal stem cells to white adipocyte-lineage cells but also brown/beige . Some relationships between expression levels of BMP receptors were significant; especially, expression levels of activin receptor-like kinase (Alk) 3 (a BMP type I receptor) positively related to those of Alk2 (another BMP type I receptor), activin receptor type II (ActRII) A (a type II receptor to transmit BMP signal), ActRIIB (another type II receptor to transmit BMP signal) and BMP receptor type 2 (Bmpr2). PR domain containing 16 (Prdm16) expression levels strongly correlated with expression levels of ActRIIB. Although PRDM16 is known to stimulate brown/beige , expression levels of Ucp1 did not correlate with those of Prdm16. On the other hand, expression levels of Ucp1 correlated with those of Alk6. The present study suggests close relationships among adipose expressions of BMP signal components, and the relationships of expression levels of BMP receptor and those of Prdm16 or Ucp1 in dogs. Further studies using more dogs with various BCS potentially lead to identification of adipose factors to relate with adiposity in dogs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31027377>Bioavailable Menthol (Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin-8 Agonist) Induces Energy Expending Phenotype in Differentiating Adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Recent evidence supports the role of menthol, a TRPM8 agonist, in enhanced energy expenditure, thermogenesis and BAT-like activity in classical WAT depots in a TRPM8 dependent and independent manner. The present study was designed to analyse whether oral and topical administration of menthol is bioavailable at subcutaneous adipose tissue and is sufficient to directlyinduce desired energy expenditure effects. GC-FID was performed to study menthol bioavailability in serum and subcutaneous white adipose tissue following oral and topical administration. Further, 3T3L1 adipocytes were treated with bioavailable menthol doses and different parameters (lipid accumulation, "/" and energy expenditure gene expression, metal analysis, mitochondrial complex's gene expression) were studied. No difference was observed in serum levels but significant difference was seen in the menthol concentration on subcutaneous adipose tissues after oral and topical application. Menthol administration at bioavailable doses significantly increased "" and energy expenditure phenotype, enhanced mitochondrial activity related gene expression, increased metal concentration during  but did not alter the lipid accumulation as well as acute experiments were performed with lower dose of menthol on mature adipocytes In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that bioavailable menthol after single oral and topical administration is sufficient to induce "" phenotype in subcutaneous adipose tissue However, critical dose characterization for its clinical utility is required.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109074>A Novel lnc-RNA, Named lnc-ORA, Is Identified by RNA-Seq Analysis, and Its Knockdown Inhibits  by Regulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p>Obesity is closely associated with numerous adipogenic regulatory factors, including coding and non-coding genes. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a major role in . However, differential expression profiles of lncRNAs in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) between wild-type (WT) and  mice, as well as their roles in , are not well understood. Here, a total of 2809 lncRNAs were detected in the iWAT of WT and  mice by RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq), including 248 novel lncRNAs. Of them, 46 lncRNAs were expressed differentially in WT and  mice and were enriched in  signaling pathways as determined by KEGG enrichment analysis, including the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathways. Furthermore, we focused on one novel lncRNA, which we named lnc-ORA (obesity-related lncRNA), which had a seven-fold higher expression in  mice than in WT mice. Knockdown of lnc-ORA inhibited preadipocyte proliferation by decreasing the mRNA and protein expression levels of cell cycle markers. Interestingly, lnc-ORA knockdown inhibited adipocyte differentiation by regulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. In summary, these findings contribute to a better understanding of  in relation to lncRNAs and provide novel potential therapeutic targets for obesity-related metabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31013762>MicroRNA-214-3p Targeting Ctnnb1 Promotes 3T3-L1 Preadipocyte Differentiation by Interfering with the Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p>Differentiation from preadipocytes into mature adipocytes is a complex biological process in which miRNAs play an important role. Previous studies showed that miR-214-3p facilitates adipocyte differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in vitro. The detailed function and molecular mechanism of miR-214-3p in adipocyte development is unclear. In this study, the 3T3-L1 cell line was used to analyze the function of miR-214-3p in vitro. Using -Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining and the CCK-8 assay, we observed that transfection with the miR-214-3p agomir visibly promoted proliferation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by up-regulating the expression of cell cycle-related genes. Interestingly, overexpression of miR-214-3p promoted 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation and up-regulated the expression of key genes for : PPARγ, FABP4, and Adiponectin. Conversely, inhibition of miR-214-3p repressed 3T3-L1 preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation, and down-regulated the expression of cell cycle-related genes and adipogenic markers. Furthermore, we proved that miR-214-3p regulates 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation by directly targeting the 3'-untranslated regions (3'UTR) of Ctnnb1, which is an important transcriptional regulatory factor of the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway. Taken together, the data indicate that miR-214-3p may positively regulate preadipocyte proliferation and enhance differentiation through the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31113010>Bouchardatine analogue alleviates non-alcoholic hepatic fatty liver disease/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in high-fat fed mice by inhibiting ATP synthase activity.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic hepatic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a manifestation of the metabolic syndrome in the liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) represents its advanced stage. R17 derived from bouchardatine, shows benefits in the metabolic syndrome, but has not been tested in the liver. The present study examined the pharmacological effects of R17 in a model of NAFLD/NASH and its mode of action.The effects of R17 were examined in mice fed a high-fat (HF) diet to induce the pathological characteristics of NAFLD/NASH and in cultures of HuH7 cells. We used histological and immunohistochemical techniques along with western blotting and siRNA. Generation of ROS and apoptosis were measured.Administration of R17 (20 mg·kg , i.p. every other day) for  weeks reversed HF-induced hepatic triglyceride content, inflammation (inflammatory cytokines and macrophage numbers), injury (hepatocyte ballooning and apoptosis, plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase), and fibrogenesis (collagen deposition and mRNA expression of fibrosis markers). In cultured cells, R17 reduced cell steatosis from both  and fatty acid influx. The attenuated inflammation and cell injury were associated with inhibition of both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress. Notably, R17 activated the liver kinase B1-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway by inhibiting activity of ATP synthase, rather than direct stimulation of AMPK.R17 has therapeutic potential for NAFLD/NASH. Its mode of action involves the elimination of ER and oxidative stresses, possibly via activating the LKB1-AMPK axis by inhibiting the activity of ATP synthase.© 2019 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31052312>Spilanthol from Traditionally Used  Enhances AMPK and Ameliorates Obesity in Mice Fed High-Fat Diet.</a></h2><p>Spilanthol (SP) is a bioactive compound found in , giving the flowers and leaves a spicy taste. Studies found that phyto-ingredients stored in spice plants act against obesity-related diseases. SP has antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties, but the effects on obesity are not yet known. We investigated the effects of SP in differentiated adipocytes (3T3-L1 cells) and mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). SP significantly inhibited intracellular lipid accumulation and significantly reduced the expression of -related proteins, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty-acid synthase (FAS). In contrast, SP increased the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT)1 and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in adipocytes. However, SP suppressed the levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), phospho-p38 (pp38), and phospho-JNK (c‑Jun N-terminal kinase) (pJNK) in LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-stimulated murine pre-adipocytes. SP administered to HFD-induced obese mice via intraperitoneal injections twice a week for 10 weeks decreased body weight gain, visceral adipose tissue weight, and adipocyte size. SP inhibited lipogenic proteins FAS and ACC, and suppressed adipogenic transcription factors, enhancing lipolysis and AMPK protein expression in the liver. SP has anti-obesity effects, upregulating AMPK to attenuate lipogenic and adipogenic transcription factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603892>A functional regulatory variant of MYH3 influences muscle fiber-type composition and intramuscular fat content in pigs.</a></h2><p>Muscle development and lipid accumulation in muscle critically affect meat quality of livestock. However, the genetic factors underlying myofiber-type specification and intramuscular fat (IMF) accumulation remain to be elucidated. Using two independent intercrosses between Western commercial breeds and Korean native pigs (KNPs) and a joint linkage-linkage disequilibrium analysis, we identified a 488.1-kb region on porcine chromosome 12 that affects both reddish meat color (a*) and IMF. In this critical region, only the MYH3 gene, encoding myosin heavy chain 3, was found to be preferentially overexpressed in the skeletal muscle of KNPs. Subsequently, MYH3-transgenic mice demonstrated that this gene controls both myofiber-type specification and  in skeletal muscle. We discovered a structural variant in the promotor/regulatory region of MYH3 for which Q allele carriers exhibited significantly higher values of a* and IMF than q allele carriers. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation and cotransfection assays showed that the structural variant in the '-flanking region of MYH3 abrogated the binding of the myogenic regulatory factors (MYF5, MYOD, MYOG, and MRF4). The allele distribution of MYH3 among pig populations worldwide indicated that the MYH3 Q allele is of Asian origin and likely predates domestication. In conclusion, we identified a functional regulatory sequence variant in porcine MYH3 that provides novel insights into the genetic basis of the regulation of myofiber type ratios and associated changes in IMF in pigs. The MYH3 variant can play an important role in improving pork quality in current breeding programs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511221>[Risedronate inhibits rat bone marrow  and reduces RANKL expression in adipocytes].</a></h2><p>To investigate the effects of risedronate on bone marrow  and the expression of the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) in adipocytes in the bone marrow micro-environment.Primary cultured rat mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) with or without adipogenic induction for 14 days were treated with 1, , 10, and 25 μmol/L risedronate. The droplets of the differentiated adipocytes were analyzed, and Western blotting was performed to detect the expression level of RANKL. Female SD rats (24-week-old) were randomly divided into sham-operated group and ovariectomy (OVX) group, and 12 weeks after the operation, the OVX rats were further divided into control group and risedronate group (2.4 μg/kg, injected subcutaneously for 3 times a week). Eight weeks later, the bone mineral density (BMD) of the rats and bone marrow histopathology of the femurs was examined to evaluate the effect of risedronate on the fat fraction in the bone marrow.Risdronate significantly inhibited adipogenic differentiation of rat BMSCs and suppressed RANKL expression in the adipocytes derived from the BMSCs in a concentration-dependent manner. In OVX rats, risdronate treatment significantly increased the BMD and decreased the fat content in the bone marrow.Risdronate can effectively inhibit the adipogenic differentiation of rat BMSCs, decrease fat content in the bone marrow, and suppress the generation and function of osteoclasts by down-regulating the expression of RANKL, which can be an important mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of risedronate against osteoporosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295363>Higher dietary protein intake preserves lean body mass, lowers liver lipid deposition, and maintains metabolic control in participants with long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders.</a></h2><p>Medical nutrition therapy for long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAODs) currently emphasizes fasting avoidance, restricted dietary long-chain fatty acid intake, supplementation with medium chain triglycerides, and increased carbohydrate intake. We hypothesize that increasing dietary protein intake relative to carbohydrate intake would preserve metabolic control yet induce physical benefits including reduced hepatic . Therefore, we compared two dietary approaches with similar fat intake but different carbohydrate to protein ratios in participants diagnosed with LC-FAODs. Thirteen participants were enrolled and randomized into either a high-protein (PRO) or a high-carbohydrate (CHO) diet for 4 months. Baseline and 4-month assessments included body composition, ectopic lipid deposition, and resting energy expenditure. End of study assessments also included total energy expenditure, metabolic responses to oral feedings, and whole-body fatty acid oxidation capacity. At the end of the dietary intervention, both groups had similar energy expenditure, fat and glucose oxidation rates, and glucolipid responses to mixed meal and oral glucose loads. Neither dietary group experienced worsening symptoms related to their LC-FAOD. Compared to the CHO group, the PRO group exhibited increased blood levels of short-chain acylcarnitines, reduced intrahepatic lipid content, and maintained lean body mass while the CHO group lost lean mass. In patients with LC-FAODs, increasing protein intake maintained metabolic control, reduced liver fat without risk of metabolic decompensation, and helped preserve lean body mass. We propose that a modest increase in dietary protein along with fasting avoidance and fat restriction may improve body composition and energy expenditure in patients with LC-FAODs.© 2019 SSIEM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31408999>Epigenetic Regulation of Adipogenic Differentiation by Histone Lysine Demethylation.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a rising public health problem that contributes to the development of several metabolic diseases and cancer. Adipocyte precursors outside of adipose depots that expand due to overweight and obesity may have a negative impact on human health. Determining how progenitor cells acquire a preadipocyte commitment and become mature adipocytes remains a significant challenge. Over the past several years, we have learned that the establishment of cellular identity is widely influenced by changes in histone marks, which in turn modulate chromatin structure. In this regard, histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) are now emerging as key players that shape chromatin through their ability to demethylate almost all major histone methylation sites. Recent research has shown that KDMs orchestrate the chromatin landscape, which mediates the activation of adipocyte-specific genes. In addition, KDMs have functions in addition to their enzymatic activity, which are beginning to be revealed, and their dysregulation seems to be related to the development of metabolic disorders. In this review, we highlight the biological functions of KDMs that contribute to the establishment of a permissive or repressive chromatin environment during the mesenchymal stem cell transition into adipocytes. Understanding how KDMs regulate  might prompt the development of new strategies for fighting obesity-related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921498>Dietary Palmitoleic Acid Attenuates Atherosclerosis Progression and Hyperlipidemia in Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Deficient Mice.</a></h2><p>Palmitoleic acid (palmitoleate; C16:1 n-7), an omega-7 monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) found in plants and marine sources, has been shown to favorably modulate lipid and glucose metabolism. However, its impact on atherosclerosis has not been examined in detail.LDL receptor knock out (LDLR-KO) mice are fed a Western diet supplemented with % (w/w) palmitoleate concentrate, oleic-rich olive oil, or none (control) for 12 weeks. Dietary palmitoleate increases hepatic C16:1 levels, improves plasma and hepatic lipid/lipoprotein profiles (≈40% decrease in triglycerides), and reduces the atherosclerotic plaque area by ≈45% compared with control or olive oil group (p < 0.05). These favorable changes are accompanied by the downregulation of key genes, such as Srebp1c, Scd1, Il-1β, and Tnfα. ApoB-depleted plasma from mice fed palmitoleate has increased cholesterol efflux capacity by 20% from ABCA1-expressing cells (p < 0.05). A beneficial effect of palmitoleate on glucose metabolism (54% decreased in HOMA-IR, p < 0.05) is also observed.Dietary-supplemented palmitoleate reduces atherosclerosis development in LDLR-KO mice, and is associated with improvement of lipid and glucose metabolism and favorable changes in regulatory genes involved in  and inflammation.

In previous studies, we screened botanical extracts for effects on   and discovered that an ethanolic extract of  (SCO) could promote adipocyte differentiation. To follow up on these studies, we have used various separation methods to identify the compound(s) responsible for SCO's adipogenic properties. Fractions and subfractions of SCO were tested for effects on lipid accumulation and adipogenic gene expression in differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Fractions were also analyzed by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography- Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS), and resulting peaks were putatively identified through high resolution, high mass accuracy mass spectrometry, literature data, and available natural products databases. The inactive fractions contained mostly quercetin derivatives and chlorogenates, including chlorogenic acid and 3,-dicaffeoylquinic acid, which had no effects on  when tested individually, thus ruling them out as pro-adipogenic bioactives in SCO.

Moreover, we established sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as an external positive control in this assay. To measure reduction in animal use to estimate the starting dose for the ATC method, we evaluated 10 chemicals representing Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) toxicity categories 1- and unclassified toxicity and determined the dose-response curves for percentage and area of cell differentiation by using the Hill function with an R ≥ 0.85. The resulting IC values were used for LD prediction and for estimating the starting dose for the ATC method. Our results indicated that use of the inhibition of  assay to estimate the starting dose for the ATC method would decrease animal use for 7 out of 10 tested substances, possibly all substances if we consider the more toxic test substances in GHS categories 1, 2, and 3.

Emerging evidence indicates that inflammation stands at the crossroads of innate immunity and lipid metabolism and links the initial metabolic stress and subsequent metabolic events in lipid metabolism.

However, little is known about the effects of these cytokines on excess sebum, a pathophysiological factor of acne development. In this study, human sebocytes were treated with 0.1-10.0× of IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 and IFN-γ for 3 or  days to elucidate the effects on lipid content. Treatment with individual cytokines decreased the lipid content at specific concentrations rather than in a concentration-dependent manner. Specifically, .0× of IL-4, .0× of IFN-γ (.0IFN), and 0.×, .0× and 10.0× of IL-10 for 3 days, and 0.× of IL-4 (0.5IL4) for  days decreased lipid content to 87.6-93.0% of the control. Treatment with other concentrations of IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-γ, and 0.1-10.0× of IL-12 did not alter lipid content. Combined treatment with 0.5IL4, .0IFN and 0.× of IL-10 for 3 or  days decreased the lipid content more than each individual treatment. However, this effect was more evident after 3 days, in parallel with decreased levels of triglycerides, cholesterol esters and free fatty acids, the major lipid compositions of sebocytes, and decreased protein expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and mature sterol response element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), the -related factors, without altered cell proliferation. We demonstrated that suppressed IL-4 and IL-10 with enhanced IFN-γ synergistically decreased lipid content and protein expression of FAS and mature SREBP-1 in human sebocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30905315>Adipocytes as lipid sensors of oleic acid transport through a functional Caco-2/HT29-MTX intestinal barrier.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue function in the regulation of lipemia is highly dependent on intestinal absorption of nutrients. Therefore the aim of the present study was the development and validation of an in vitro multiculture model allowing to measure intestinal absorption using adipocytes as lipid sensors. We previously described (1) novel methods to study oleic acid induction of  and  and (2) a functional reconstituted intestinal barrier using human cell lines Caco-2/HT29-MTX (9:1). In the present study we develop a co-culture model with either adipocytes or hepatocytes as sensors for intestinal lipid absorption. This model was validated using oleic acid (OA) pre-absorbed onto the intestinal barrier. Optimized experimental conditions were obtained with partially differentiated 3T3L1-MBX adipocytes sensing up to  μM OA in solution or 40 μM OA pre-absorbed by Caco2/HT29-MTX intestinal barriers. Metabolism including glycemia and insulinemia greatly influenced the ability to  TG accumulation in adipocytes. By comparison AML12 hepatocytes found less sensitive to OA (up to 1 μM). The present study demonstrates a much better functionality for fatty acid uptake and release in Caco2/HT29-MTX versus Caco-2 intestinal barriers. Taken together these results open new opportunities to study in vitro lipid transfer between intestinal barriers and either adipocytes or hepatocytes.

Here, we investigated the metabolic impact of this intervention in 2-mo-old prediabetic University of California, Davis type 2 diabetes mellitus rats by assessing liver gene expression at 1. mo post-IT surgery. Pathway analysis indicated decreased signaling  TGF-β/Smad (a family of proteins named mothers against decapentaplegic homologs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), and PI3K-Akt-AMPK-mechanistic target of rapamycin, likely targeting hepatic stellate cells because differentiation and activation of these cells is associated with decreased signaling  PPAR and TGF-β/Smad. IT surgery up-regulated the expression of genes involved in regulation of cholesterol and terpenoid syntheses and down-regulated those involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism [including cardiolipin (CL)], , and gluconeogenesis. Consistent with the down-regulation of the hepatic CL pathway, IT surgery produced a metabolic switch in liver, kidney cortex, and fat depots toward decreased mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, the process required to fuel high energy-demanding pathways (, gluconeogenesis and glyceroneogenesis), whereas opposite effects were observed in skeletal and cardiac muscles. This study demonstrates for the first time the presence of metabolic pathways that complement the effects of IT surgery to maximize its benefits and potentially identify similarly effective, durable, and less invasive therapeutic options for metabolic disease, including inhibitors of TGF-β signaling.-Hung, C., Napoli, E., Ross-Inta, C., Graham, J., Flores-Torres, A.

The bone morphogenetic protein-8B (BMP8B) has been shown to be expressed in brown adipose tissues and the hypothalamus and to affect thermogenesis and susceptibility to diet-induced obesity. Here, we aimed to analyze BMP8B expression in NAFLD and to gain insight into BMP8B effects on pathophysiological steps of NAFLD progression. BMP8B mRNA and protein expression were dose-dependently induced in primary human hepatocytes in vitro upon incubation with fatty acids. Furthermore, hepatic BMP8B expression was significantly increased in a murine NAFLD model and in NAFLD patients compared with controls. Incubation with recombinant BMP8B further enhanced the fatty acid-induced cellular lipid accumulation as well as NFκB activation and pro-inflammatory gene expression in hepatocytes, while siRNA-mediated BMP8B depletion ameliorated these fatty acid-induced effects. Analysis of the expression of key factors of hepatocellular lipid transport and metabolisms indicated that BMP8B effects on fatty acid uptake as well as de novo  contributed to hepatocellular accumulation of fatty acids leading to increased storage in the form of triglycerides and enhanced combustion by beta oxidation. In conclusion, our data indicate that BMP8B enhances different pathophysiological steps of NAFLD progression and suggest BMP8B as a promising prognostic marker and therapeutic target for NAFLD and, potentially, also for other chronic liver diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569380>Curcumin Attenuates  by Inducing Preadipocyte Apoptosis and Inhibiting Adipocyte Differentiation.</a></h2><p>Patients with metabolic syndrome are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The principal risk factor for development of metabolic syndrome is obesity, defined as a state of pathological hyperplasia or/and hypertrophy of adipose tissue. The number of mature adipocytes is determined by adipocyte differentiation from preadipocytes. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effects of curcumin on  and the underlying mechanism. To examine cell toxicity of curcumin, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with 0-50 µM curcumin for 24, 48, or 72 h, then cell viability was measured using the MTT (3-(4,-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The effect of curcumin on the cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry. Curcumin-induced cell apoptosis was determined by the TUNEL assay and curcumin-induced caspase activation was measured by immunoblotting. The effect of curcumin on adipocyte differentiation was determined by measuring mitotic clonal expansion (MCE), expression of adipogenic transcription factors, and lipid accumulation. Results showed the viability of preadipocytes was significantly decreased by treatment with 30 µM curcumin, a concentration that caused apoptosis in preadipocytes, as assessed by the TUNEL assay, and caused activation of caspases 8, 9, and 3. A non-cytotoxic dose of curcumin (15 µM) inhibited MCE, downregulated the expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, prevented differentiation medium-induced β-catenin downregulation, and decreased the lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In conclusion, our data show that curcumin can induce preadipocyte apoptosis and inhibit adipocyte differentiation, leading to suppression of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31483956>Effect of mechanical loading and substrate elasticity on the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.</a></h2><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are highly sensitive to biomechanics of their extra-cellular environment. Generally, a higher elasticity of culture substrates can drive cells into the osteogenic lineage, whereas low substrate elasticity results in . Applied mechanical loading by cyclic strain is another major variable influencing cell fate. Yet, little is known about the simultaneous effect of both cues. Therefore, the present study investigated the relative importance of both cues on differentiation. MSCs were cultured in an osteogenic and also an adipogenic environment on soft PAAm (E= 23±0.3 kPa), stiff PAAm (111±2 kPa), and PDMS (E= 1,±0.07 MPa); either unstrained or with 8% cyclic strain at 1 Hz. Without strain, the relative expression of the early osteogenic marker alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was significantly higher (78%) on PDMS than both PAAm. With 8% cyclic strain ALP expression increased for all groups in comparison to unstrained controls. The highest increase was observed for the soft PAAm by 36%. Moreover, relative Oil red O (ORO) expression -indicating - was the highest for unstrained soft PAAm. On the other hand, the percentage ORO positive cells significantly decreased by 57% and 69% for PAAm soft and stiff when strained. In conclusion, biomaterial elasticity and mechanical loading can act simultaneously on cell differentiation. Substrate elasticity is an important factor regulating the differentiation, but cyclic strain can drive MSCs towards the osteogenesis even on the softest substrate. As such, the osteogenic effect of mechanical loading can overrule the adipogenic effect of soft substrates, thereby acting as an inhibitor.This article is protected by copyright.

Considerable evidence suggests that pear fruit consumption is associated with a lower risk of obesity-related complications. Thus, the present study is conducted to investigate the therapeutic potential of pear extract (PE) for reversing obesity and associated metabolic complications in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.Obesity is induced in male C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet for 11 weeks. After the first 6 weeks on the diet, obese mice are administered vehicle or PE for  weeks. PE treatment decreases body weight gain, expands white adipose tissue (WAT), and causes hepatic steatosis in obese mice, as well as inhibits  and . Impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance are improved by PE. In addition, PE reduces macrophage infiltration and expression of pro-inflammatory genes and deactivates mitogen-activated protein kinases in WAT. Finally, malaxinic acid is identified as an active component responsible for the anti-obesity effects of PE in mice.The results demonstrate that PE supplementation ameliorates diet-induced obesity and associated metabolic complications and suggest the health-beneficial effects of both pear fruits and malaxinic acid in counteracting these diseases.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The objective of this study was to investigate the antiobesity potential of d-psicose and the possible mechanism using Wistar rats as the animal model. The animals were divided into five groups and supplemented with diets containing % of different carbohydrates, such as glucose, fructose, cellulose, d-psicose, and a control diet, for 4 weeks. After sacrifice, blood lipid profile, tissue morphology, and related genes participating in lipid metabolism were analyzed. The results indicated that the supplementation by d-psicose leads to minimum fat accumulation in rats when compared with the other carbohydrates. The blood lipid profile and antioxidative activity of the rat were also improved. d-Psicose can regulate lipid metabolism by increasing the lipid-metabolism-related enzymes such as SDH in serum and liver and HL in the liver. d-Psicose can prevent fat accumulation by suppressing the expression of -related gene ACCα and hepatic fatty acid uptake gene (FAS and SREBP-1c), while stimulating the expression for fatty-acid-oxidation-related gene including AMPK2α, HSL, and PPARα. In conclusion, d-psicose can be considered to be a healthy alternative to traditional sweeteners.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310961>Antiobesity effects of anthocyanins on mitochondrial biogenesis, inflammation, and oxidative stress: A systematic review.</a></h2><p>Studies have shown that anthocyanins attenuate obesity. In this review, we confirm these effects and explain the possible mechanisms underlying them. A systematic search was conducted in electronic databases using obesity as the main term along with anthocyanins and the main anthocyanidins, including articles in Portuguese, English, and Spanish without any restriction as to year. The review was carried out by peers following PRISMA recommendations: 1980 studies were identified, and 19 articles were analyzed. The studies varied in relation to time, pathways, cells used, and anthocyanin types. The positive effects were observed in ' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase pathways and mitochondrial biogenesis and in a reduction in inflammation and oxidative stress. Anthocyanins can improve the metabolic control involved in obesity by reducing , oxidative stress, and inflammation. This can boost the speed of lipolysis and thermogenesis, regulate satiety, and reduce body fat accumulation. In addition, anthocyanins have shown promising effects on controlling obesity compared with the standard of care.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we report our observation that polyphenols and phenolic acids inhibit  in 3T3-L1 with different intensity depending on the family and the stage of differentiation. While quercetin and resveratrol inhibited lipid accumulation along the whole process of differentiation, apigenin and myricetin were active during the early and latest stages, but not intermediate, contrary to hesperidin. The activity of phenolic acids was limited to the early stages of the differentiation process, except -coumaric and ellagic acids.

We evaluated the modulation of NADPH-producing enzymes associated with the antifibrotic, antioxidant and antilipemic effects of nicotinamide (NAM) in a model of NASH induced by excess fructose consumption. Male rats were provided drinking water containing 40% fructose for 16 weeks. During the last 12 weeks of fructose administration, water containing NAM was provided to some of the rats for  h/day. The biochemical profiles and the ghrelin, leptin, lipoperoxidation and TNF-α levels in serum and the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), malic enzyme (ME) and NADP-dependent isocitric dehydrogenase (IDP) levels, the reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) and reduced/oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H/NAD(P)) ratios, and the levels of various lipogenic and fibrotic markers in the liver were evaluated. The results showed that hepatic fibrosis induced by fructose consumption was associated with weight gain, hunger-satiety system dysregulation, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, lipoperoxidation and inflammation. Moreover, increased levels of hepatic G6PD and ME activity and expression, the NAD(P)H/NAD(P) ratios, and GSSG concentration and increased expression of lipogenic and fibrotic markers were detected, and these alterations were attenuated by NAM administration. Specifically, NAM diminished the activity and expression of G6PD and ME, and this effect was associated with a decrease in the NADPH/NADP ratios, increased GSH levels and decreased lipoperoxidation and inflammation, ameliorating fibrosis and NASH development. NAM reduces liver steatosis and fibrosis by regulating redox homeostasis through a G6PD- and ME-dependent mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31100089>Catechin attenuates TNF-α induced inflammatory response via AMPK-SIRT1 pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammation is a fundamental symptom of many diseases. Catechin possesses anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the mechanism of catechin to prevent inflammation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes caused by TNF-α remains unknown. Therefore, the effects of catechin on the gene expression of cytokines and the activation of cell signals in TNF-α induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes were investigated. The effects of catechin on  and cell viability were detected by Oil Red O staining and CCK-8 assay, respectively. The genes expression of cytokines was determined by real-time RT-PCR. The expression of NF-κB, AMPK, FOXO3a and SIRT1 on translation level was determined by western blotting analysis. The results demonstrated that catechin significantly enhanced  and cell viability. catechin inhibited the gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12p35, and inflammatory enzymes including iNOS and COX-2, but enhanced the gene expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-4 and IL-10. Catechin also inhibited the activation of NF-κB, AMPK, FOXO3a and SIRT1, but increased the phosphorylation level of the above factors.

To get more insight, ovariectomized C57Bl6/J mice fed a high-fat high-sucrose diet were chronically exposed from  to 20 weeks of age to a low-dose mixture of chemicals with one dioxin, one polychlorobiphenyl, one phthalate and bisphenol A. Part of the mice received as well E2 implants to explore the potential estrogenic dependency of the metabolic alterations. With this model, estrogen loss resulted in glucose but not lipid metabolism impairment, and E2 replacement normalized the enhanced body and fat pad weight, and the glucose intolerance and insulin resistance linked to ovariectomy. It also altered cholesterol metabolism in the liver concurrently with enhanced estrogen receptor Esr1 mRNA level. In addition, fat depots responded differently to estrogen withdrawal (e.g., selective mRNA enhancement of  markers in subcutaneous and of inflammation in visceral fat pads) and replacement challenges. Importantly, the pollutant mixture impacted lipid deposition and mRNA expression of several genes related to lipid metabolism but not Esr1 in the liver. Adiponectin levels were altered as well. In addition, the mRNA abundance of the various estrogen receptors was regionally impacted in fat tissues. Besides, xenobiotic processing genes did not change in response to the pollutant mixture in the liver. The present findings bring new light on estrogen-dependent metabolic alterations with regards to situations of loss of estrogens as observed after menopause.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

ChREBP is considered to be the dominant regulator of DNL in adipose tissue (AT); however, the SREBPs are highly expressed and robustly regulated in adipocytes, suggesting that the model of AT DNL may be incomplete. Here we describe a new mouse model of inducible, adipocyte-specific overexpression of the insulin-induced gene 1 (Insig1), a negative regulator of SREBP transcriptional activity. Contrary to convention, Insig1 overexpression did block AT lipogenic gene expression.

Herein, we investigated the effects of oleacein on certain markers of  and insulin-resistance in vitro, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and in vivo in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. During the differentiation process of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes, oleacein strongly inhibited lipid accumulation, and decreased protein levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and fatty acid synthase (FAS), while increasing Adiponectin levels. In vivo, treatment with oleacein of C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice fed with HFD for  and 13 weeks prevented the increase in adipocyte size and reduced the inflammatory infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes in adipose tissue. These effects were accompanied by changes in the expression of adipose tissue-specific regulatory elements such as PPARγ, FAS, sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor-1 (SREBP-1), and Adiponectin, while the expression of insulin-sensitive muscle/fat glucose transporter Glut-4 was restored in HFD-fed mice treated with oleacein.

Our aim was firstly to investigate patterns of fatty acids (FA) composition through various stages of CKD, and secondly, to evaluate the effect of CKD-specific FA disturbances on the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism at a cellular level. Serum FA composition was analyzed in 191 patients with consecutive severity stages of CKD, and 30 healthy controls free from CKD. Next, HepG2 human hepatic cells were treated with major representatives of various FA groups, as well as with FA extracted from a mix of serums of controls and of CKD stage  patients. Across worsening stages of CKD severity, there was an increasing monounsaturated FA (MUFA) content. It was associated with a concomitant decrease in n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated FA. The incubation of hepatocytes with FA from CKD patients (compared to that of healthy subjects), resulted in significantly higher mRNA levels of genes involved in FA synthesis (fatty acid synthase () increased 13.7 ± 3. times, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 () increased 4.26 ± 0.36 times), and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) formation (apolipoprotein B ) increased 7.35 ± 1. times, microsomal triacylglycerol transfer protein () increased 2.74 ± 0.43 times).

To this end, a total number of 50 male Wistar rats (aged 23 months, 438.27 g) were obtained from Pasteur Institute of Iran. The rats were randomized into five groups (10 rats/per group) including moderate endurance training (MET), high-intensity endurance training (HET), moderate-intensity resistance training (MRT), high-intensity resistance training (HRT), and control (CON). The four training groups completed 8 weeks of a training program,  days a week, according to the study protocol. To evaluate miR-133a, miR-103a, miR-204, and other adipogenic and osteogenic genes such as RUNX2 and PPARγ via real-time PCR, total RNA including mRNA and miRNA was isolated from the bone marrow.

Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) supplementation reduces fructose-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study was to determine the role of FGF21 and underlying mechanisms in the protective effects of LGG.FGF21 knockout (KO) mice and C57BL/6 wild type (WT) mice were fed 30% fructose for 12 weeks. LGG was administered to the mice in the last 4 weeks during fructose feeding. FGF21-adiponectin (ADPN)-mediated hepatic  and inflammation were investigated.FGF21 expression was robustly increased after -weeks of feeding and significantly decreased after 12-weeks of feeding in fructose-induced NAFLD mice. LGG administration reversed the depressed FGF21 expression, increased adipose production of ADPN, and reduced hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation in the WT mice but not in the KO mice. Hepatic nuclear carbohydrate responsive-element binding protein (ChREBP) was increased by fructose and reduced by LGG, resulting in a reduction in the expression of lipogenic genes. The methylated form of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) C, which dephosphorylates and activates ChREBP, was upregulated by fructose and normalized by LGG. Leucine carboxyl methyltransferase-1, which methylates PP2AC, was also increased by fructose and decreased by LGG. However, those beneficial effects of LGG were blunted in the KO mice. Hepatic dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate, which inhibits PP2A, was markedly increased by LGG in the WT mice but attenuated in the KO mice. LGG decreased adipose hypertrophy and increased serum levels of ADPN, which regulates sphingosine metabolism. This beneficial effect was decreased in the KO mice.LGG administration increases hepatic FGF21 expression and serum ADPN concentration, resulting in a reduced ChREBP activation through dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate-mediated PP2A deactivation, and subsequently reversed fructose-induced NAFLD. Thus, our data suggest that FGF21 is required for the beneficial effects of LGG in reversal of fructose-induced NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

HE at doses of 10 g kg (LHE), 20 g kg (MHE), and 40 g kg (HHE) were individually mixed with the basal diet and fed to grass carp for 10 weeks, and ginseng extract (20 g kg, GSE) was used as a positive control. The results showed that HE administration exerted no effect on growth performance, but the hepatosomatic index (HSI) and muscle and liver lipid contents were significantly decreased in the LHE and MHE groups. The serum levels of LDL-c, total triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) also declined in the HE-treated groups. Moreover, the disordered vacuolization and nucleus migration in the liver were alleviated in the MHE and HHE groups, and mRNA expressions of -related genes, such as acc1, fas, srebp1, and pparγ decreased. Similarly, the expression of genes related to lipolysis, such as cpt1, atgl, lpl, and pparα, was found to be significantly increased in the MHE and HHE groups compared with the control. Taken together, HE can effectively improve the lipid metabolism and ameliorate the lipid deposition of grass carp and thus may be a promising feed additive in aquaculture.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31543975>Risk of diabetes associated with fatty acids in the de novo  pathway is independent of insulin sensitivity and response: the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS).</a></h2><p>To examine the associations of fatty acids in the de novo  (DNL) pathway, specifically myristic acid (14:0), palmitic acid (16:0), palmitoleic acid (c16:1 n-7), myristoleic acid (c14:1n5), stearic acid (18:0) and oleic acid (c18:1 n-9), with -year risk of type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that DNL fatty acids are associated with risk of type 2 diabetes independent of insulin sensitivity.We evaluated 719 (mean age 55.1±8. years, 44.2% men, 42.3% Caucasians) participants from the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study. Multivariable logistic regression models with and without adjustment of insulin sensitivity were used to assess prospective associations of DNL fatty acids with incident type 2 diabetes.Type 2 diabetes incidence was 20.3% over  years. In multivariable regression models, palmitic, palmitoleic, myristic, myristoleic and oleic acids were associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (p<0.05). Palmitic acid had the strongest association (OR per standard unit of palmitic acid 1.46; 95% CI 1.23 to 1.76; p<0.001), which remained similar with addition of insulin sensitivity and acute insulin response (AIR) to the model (OR 1.36; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.70, p=0.01). Oleic and palmitoleic acids were also independently associated with incident type 2 diabetes.

We have previously shown that exercise may amplify energy expenditure through energetically expensive nutrient deposition. Therefore, we investigated the effect of exercise on hepatic de novo  (DNL) during WLM and relapse to obesity. Obese rats were calorically restricted with (EX) or without (SED) treadmill exercise (1 h/day, 6 days/wk, 15 m/min) to induce and maintain weight loss. After 6 wk of WLM, subsets of WLM-SED and WLM-EX rats were allowed ad libitum access to food for 1 day to promote relapse (REL). An energy gap-matched group of sedentary, relapsing rats (REL-GM) were provided a diet matched to the positive energy imbalance of the REL-EX rats. During relapse, exercise increased enrichment of hepatic DN-derived lipids and induced hepatic molecular adaptations favoring DNL compared with the gap-matched controls. In the liver, compared with both REL-SED and REL-GM rats, REL-EX rats had lower hepatic expression of genes required for cholesterol biosynthesis; greater hepatic expression of genes that mediate very low-density lipoprotein synthesis and secretion; and greater mRNA expression of , which encodes an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of bile acids. Altogether, these data provide compelling evidence that the liver has an active role in exercise-mediated potentiation of energy expenditure during early relapse.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907511>Sal B targets TAZ to facilitate osteogenesis and reduce  through MEK-ERK pathway.</a></h2><p>Salvianolic acid B (Sal B), a major bioactive component of Chinese herb, was identified as a mediator for bone metabolism recently. The aim of this study is to investigate the underlying mechanisms by which Sal B regulates osteogenesis and . We used MC3T3-E1 and 3T3-L1 as the study model to explore the changes of cell differentiation induced by Sal B. The results indicated that Sal B at different concentrations had no obvious toxicity effects on cell proliferation during differentiation. Furthermore, Sal B facilitated osteogenesis but inhibited  by increasing the expression of transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). Accordingly, TAZ knock-down offset the effects of Sal B on cell differentiation into osteoblasts or adipocytes. Notably, the Sal B induced up-expression of TAZ was blocked by U0126 (the MEK-ERK inhibitor), rather than LY294002 (the PI3K-Akt inhibitor). Moreover, Sal B increased the p-ERK/ERK ratio to regulate the TAZ expression as well as the cell differentiation. In summary, this study suggests for the first time that Sal B targets TAZ to facilitate osteogenesis and reduce  by activating MEK-ERK signalling pathway, which provides evidence for Sal B to be used as a potential therapeutic agent for the management of bone diseases.© 2019 The Authors.

Although rice hull has been reported to show various bioactivities, no studies have evaluated its anti-obesity effect. We hope to demonstrate the anti-obesity effect of rice hull extract (RHE) and the underlying mechanism in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Serum lipid profiles were determined by enzymatic methods. Histological analysis of liver and epididymis fat tissues was carried out with hematoxylin and eosin stain. The mRNA expression of adipogenic markers was analyzed with qRT-PCR and western blotting. Oral administration of RHE reduced body weight gain and fat accumulation in HFD-fed mice. RHE also reduced lipid accumulation by inhibiting the mRNA expression of adipogenic-related genes in HFD-fed obese mice and differentiated preadipocytes. The downregulation of  by RHE was mediated through the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). In addition, RHE induced the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (ERK) in liver and epididymis adipose tissues of HFD-fed obese mice. Taken together, these findings indicate that RHE could inhibit the differentiation of adipose cell and prevent HFD-induced obesity, suggesting its potential in the prevention of obesity and metabolic syndrome and related-disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31277646>'-hydroxy Auraptene stimulates osteoblast differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells via a BMP-dependent mechanism.</a></h2><p>Identifying bone anabolic agents is a superior strategy for the treatment of osteoporosis.

In this study, we investigated the effect of '-Hydroxy Auraptene ('-HA), a coumarin derivative that newly isolated from Lotus lalambensis Schweinf on the differentiation of the mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal (skeletal) stem cells (mBMSCs) into osteoblast and adipocyte.The effect of '-HA on mBMSCs cell proliferation and osteoblast differentiation was assessed by measuring cell viability, quantitative alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay, Alizarin red staining for matrix mineralization and osteogenic gene array expression.  was measured by Oil Red O staining and quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) analysis of adipogenic markers. Regulation of BMPs signaling pathways by '-HA was measured by Western blot analysis and qPCR.'-HA showed to stimulate the differentiation of mBMSCs into osteogenic cell lineage in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting their differentiation into adipocytic cell lineage. Treatment of mBMSCs with '-HA showed to promote significantly the BMP2-induced osteogenesis in mBMSCs via activating Smad1//8 phosphorylation and increasing Smad4 expression.

Recent studies emphasize the importance of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in maintaining metabolic health, and MO was recently demonstrated to impair BAT thermogenic function in offspring. The current study aimed to investigate the mechanisms leading to the impairment in fetal BAT development due to MO. Female C57BL/6J mice were fed a control diet or a 60% high-fat diet for 10 weeks, mated and maintained on their respective diets during pregnancy. Fetal tissue was collected at E18., the late stage of pregnancy. Fetal BAT contained more triglycerides compared to the control, which was correlated with higher expression of white adipogenic markers. On the other hand, the expression of BAT markers was down-regulated in the MO fetal BAT. Based on RNA-sequencing analyses, genes related to mitochondriogenesis and myogenesis were found to be down-regulated, while those related to white adipocyte differentiation were up-regulated in MO fetal BAT. Because brown adipocytes are derived from myogenic progenitors, the down-regulation of myogenic genes might partially explain hampered brown  in MO fetal BAT. Consistently, mitochondrial DNA and mitochondrial biogenesis markers were also down-regulated in MO fetal BAT. MicroRNA-sequencing identified that miR-204-5p expression was elevated in MO fetal BAT. This microRNA targeted the 3'-untranslated regions of PGC1α and Sirt1 mRNA to suppress their expression and impair mitochondriogenesis. In summary, MO impaired fetal BAT development through suppressing myogenesis and brown  while enhancing white adipogenic commitment, and inhibited mitochondriogenesis partially through enhancing miR-204-5p expression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, propranolol has been found to be an effective therapy for IH, but its mechanism of action is not yet understood. Hemangioma stem cells (HemSCs) have a mesenchymal morphology, robust proliferation, and multilineage differentiation (into adipocytes). Therefore, we hypothesized that propranolol could accelerate the transdifferentiation of HemSCs and prevent the growth of proliferating IH. In this study, the fibrofatty tissue of IH that received therapy with propranolol appeared much earlier than without the treatment.We isolated HemSCs with CD133-tagged immunomagnetic beads, and then we used flow cytometry technology to analyze the HemSC phenotypes and determine whether propranolol induced HemSC death. The proliferation and  abilities of propranolol-treated HemSCs were analyzed by 3-(4,)-dimethylthiahiazo(-z-y1)-3,-diphenytetrazoliumromide assay, Oil red O staining, and Western blotting.We observed that the HemSC morphological traits gradually became spindle shaped, like fibroblasts, and the average extraction yield of HemSCs was about 0.25%. The HemSCs had high rates of expression for CD90 (98.8%) and CD105 (97.8%) but did not significantly express CD31 (0.7%). We also found a 100 μM concentration of propranolol cutoff point. Propranolol did not affect HemSC survival significantly at low concentrations (6.25, 12., 25.0, and 50.0 μM). However, propranolol resulted in a sharp and significant variation in cell morphology and survival rates at high concentrations (100, 200, and 400 μM). The results suggest that treatment with propranolol inhibited HemSC proliferation and induced cell death and apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Oil droplets determined by Oil red O staining showed that propranolol increased the transdifferentiation rate of HemSCs into adipocytes. Furthermore, the expressions of phosphorylated AKT and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) were increased with a 100 μM concentration of propranolol in HemSC culture.Our study found that propranolol inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis and necrosis, and promoted differentiation of HemSCs. Propranolol may upregulate PPARγ via PI3K pathways, thereby accelerating  and enhancing IH HemSC .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30862029>Peanut Sprout Extracts Attenuate Triglyceride Accumulation by Promoting Mitochondrial Fatty Acid Oxidation in Adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Peanut sprouts (PS), which are germinated peanut seeds, have recently been reported to have anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-obesity effects. However, the underlying mechanisms by which PS modulates lipid metabolism are largely unknown. To address this question, serial doses of PS extract (PSE) were added to 3T3-L1 cells during adipocyte differentiation. PSE (25 µg/mL) significantly attenuated  by inhibiting lipid accumulation in addition to reducing the level of adipogenic protein and gene expression with the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Other adipocyte cell models such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts C3H10T1/2 and primary adipocytes also confirmed the anti-adipogenic properties of PSE. Next, we investigated whether PSE attenuated lipid accumulation in mature adipocytes. We found that PSE significantly suppressed lipogenic gene expression, while fatty acid (FA) oxidation genes were upregulated. Augmentation of FA oxidation by PSE in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes was confirmed via a radiolabeled-FA oxidation rate experiment by measuring the conversion of [³H]-oleic acid (OA) to [³H]-H₂O. Furthermore, PSE enhanced the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR), especially maximal respiration, and beige adipocyte formation in adipocytes. In summary, PSE was effective in reducing lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes through mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation involved in AMPK and mitochondrial activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553232>GDF5 Promotes White Adipose Tissue Thermogenesis via p38 MAPK Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p>Growth differentiation factor  (GDF5) was reported to regulate brown ; however, its effects on insulin sensitivity, full metabolic syndrome spectrum, and the thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) have not been elucidated yet. We thus generated fatty acid-binding protein 4 (Fabp4)-GDF5 transgenic (TG) mice and showed that GDF5 TG mice developed a relative lean phenotype on a high-fat diet (HFD) and showed increased insulin sensitivity. Over expression of GDF5 in adipose tissues greatly promoted the thermogenic process in sWAT after cold or β3-agonist treatment. In TG mice, sWAT showed an important thermogenic effect as the thermogenic gene expression was markedly increased, which was consistent with the typical features of beige adipocytes. Moreover, knockdown of the protein GDF5 impaired browning program in sWAT after thermogenic stimuli. Enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) signaling was also identified in sWAT of HFD-fed GDF5 mice, and thermogenesis in mature adipocytes induced by GDF5 protein could be partly blocked by a p38 MAPK inhibitor. Taken together, our data suggest that GDF5 could improve insulin sensitivity and prevent metabolic syndrome, the adaptive thermogenesis in sWAT could mediate the obesity resistance effects of GDF5 in mice and partially resulted in the activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31183958>Dynamic Mechanics-Modulated Hydrogels to Regulate the Differentiation of Stem-Cell Spheroids in Soft Microniches and Modeling of the Nonlinear Behavior.</a></h2><p>Although mechanisms of how physical forces convert into biochemical signals are increasingly understood, it is still unknown how soft cues guide cell behavior. Herein, it is shown that the commitment and differentiation of encapsulating human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) spheroids in thermosensitive 3D hydrogels are simply altered by interpenetrating poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (NIPAM-HEMA) nanogel to a gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) network. This cell-laden hydrogel provides dynamic mechanics with covalent crosslinking coordinated reversible physical networks, which can regulate hMSCs in situ by reversibly stiffening soft niches via multicyclic temperature changes from 25 to 37 °C. The spreading of hMSC spheroids in the hydrogel is strongly dependent on myosin-dependent traction stress with dynamic mechanical stimuli through focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling. Notably, the dynamic microenvironment gradually influences the expression and distribution from the basal to apical side of nuclear lamin A/C and increases the Yes-associated protein (YAP) nuclear localization with cycles, which ultimately favors hMSCs undergoing osteogenesis (but not ) in the soft microniche. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the viscoelastic behavior of the soft microniche can be guided by temperature through a nonlinear model. These findings highlight the central roles of the dynamic relationship between the biomechanical signals and mechanosensitive transcriptional regulators in cellular mechanosensing.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We investigated the effects of a KD vs a 'Western' diet (WD) on markers of hepatic lipid metabolism and oxidative stress in exercising rats. Male and female Wistar rats with access to voluntary running wheels were randomized to three groups (n= 8-14 per group): standard chow (SC; 17% Fat), WD (42% Fat) or KD (90.% Fat) for 7 weeks. Body fat percentage (BF%) was increased in WD and KD vs SC, although KD females displayed lower BF% vs WD (p≤0.05). Liver triglycerides were higher in KD and WD vs SC, but were attenuated in KD females vs WD (p≤0.05). KD suppressed hepatic markers of de novo  (FAS, ACC) and increased markers of mitochondrial biogenesis/content (PGC-1α, TFAM and citrate synthase activity). KD also increased the hepatic GPx1 and lowered oxidized glutathione. Females rats exhibited elevated hepatic markers of mitochondrial biogenesis (TFAM), mitophagy (LC3II/I ratio, ATG 12:) and cellular energy homeostasis (pAMPK/AMPK) vs males. These data highlight that KD and exercise beneficially impacts hepatic metabolism and oxidative stress and merits further investigation. • Ketogenic diet feeding combined with exercise improved hepatic oxidative stress, suppressed markers of de novo , increased markers of mitochondrial content vs western diet feeding. • Males and females responded similarly to combined ketogenic diet feeding and exercise. • Female rats exhibited elevated hepatic markers of autophagy/mitophagy and energy homeostasis compared with male rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31145699>A randomized 3-way crossover study indicates that high-protein feeding induces de novo  in healthy humans.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUNDDietary changes have led to the growing prevalence of type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. A hallmark of both disorders is hepatic lipid accumulation, derived in part from increased de novo . Despite the popularity of high-protein diets for weight loss, the effect of dietary protein on de novo  is poorly studied. We aimed to characterize the effect of dietary protein on de novo lipid synthesis.METHODSWe use a 3-way crossover interventional study in healthy males to determine the effect of high-protein feeding on de novo , combined with in vitro models to determine the lipogenic effects of specific amino acids. The primary outcome was a change in de novo -associated triglycerides in response to protein feeding.RESULTSWe demonstrate that high-protein feeding, rich in glutamate, increases de novo -associated triglycerides in plasma (1.-fold compared with control; P < 0.0001) and liver-derived very low-density lipoprotein particles (1.8-fold; P < 0.0001) in samples from human subjects (n = 9 per group). In hepatocytes, we show that glutamate-derived carbon is incorporated into triglycerides via palmitate. In addition, supplementation with glutamate, glutamine, and leucine, but not lysine, increased triglyceride synthesis and decreased glucose uptake. Glutamate, glutamine, and leucine increased activation of protein kinase B, suggesting that induction of de novo  occurs via the insulin signaling cascade.CONCLUSIONThese findings provide mechanistic insight into how select amino acids induce de novo  and insulin resistance, suggesting that high-protein feeding to tackle diabetes and obesity requires greater consideration.FUNDINGThe research was supported by UK Medical Research Council grants MR/P011705/1, MC_UP_A090_1006 and MR/P01836X/1.

Since the high fat content of VLC diets may predispose to hepatic steatosis and hepatic insulin resistance, we investigated the effect of a VLC weight-reduction diet on measures of hepatic and whole body insulin resistance in obese rats.In Phase 1, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were made obese by ad libitum consumption of a high-fat (HF1, 60% of energy) diet; control rats ate a lower-fat (LF, 15%) diet for 10 weeks. In Phase 2, obese rats were fed energy-restricted amounts of a VLC (%C, 65%F), LC (19%C, 55%F) or HC (55%C, 15%F) diet for 8 weeks while HF2 rats continued the HF diet ad libitum. In Phase 3, VLC rats were switched to the HC diet for 1 week. At the end of each phase, measurements of body composition and metabolic parameters were obtained. Hepatic insulin resistance was assessed by comparing expression of insulin-regulated genes following an oral glucose load,that increased plasma insulin levels, with the expression observed in the feed-deprived state.At the end of Phase 1, body weight, percent body fat, and hepatic lipid levels were greater in HF1 than LF rats ( < 0.05). At the end of Phase 2, percent body fat and intramuscular triglyceride decreased in LC and HC ( < 0.05), but not VLC rats, despite similar weight loss. VLC and HF2 rats had higher HOMA-IR and higher insulin at similar glucose levels following an  glucose load than HC rats ( < 0.05). HC, but not VLC or HF2 rats, showed changes in  and  expression ( < 0.05) in response to an oral glucose load. At the end of Phase 3, switching from the VLC to the HC diet mitigated differences in hepatic gene expression.When compared with a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet that produced similar weight loss, a commonly used VLC diet failed to improve whole body insulin resistance; it also reduced insulin's effect on hepatic gene expression, which may reflect the development of hepatic insulin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31086981>Quizalofop-p-Ethyl Induces  in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals is an established risk factor for obesity. The most commonly used pesticide active ingredients have never been tested in an  assay. We tested for the first time the potential of glyphosate, 2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, dicamba, mesotrione, isoxaflutole, and quizalofop-p-ethyl (QpE) to induce lipid accumulation in murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Only QpE caused a dose-dependent statistically significant triglyceride accumulation from a concentration of  up to 100 µM. The QpE commercial formulation Targa Super was 100 times more cytotoxic than QpE alone. Neither the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182, 780 nor the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 was able to block the QpE-induced lipid accumulation. RNAseq analysis of 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to QpE suggests that this compound exerts its lipid accumulation effects via a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ)-mediated pathway, a nuclear receptor whose modulation influences lipid metabolism. QpE was further shown to be active in a PPARγ reporter gene assay at 100 µM, reaching 4% of the maximal response produced by rosiglitazone, which acts as a positive control. This indicates that lipid accumulation induced by QpE is only in part caused by PPARγ activation. The lipid accumulation capability of QpE we observe suggest that this pesticide, whose use is likely to increase in coming years may have a hitherto unsuspected obesogenic property.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, the mechanistic role of ROS-mediated regulation of mitochondrial function in NAFLD has not been elucidated. Since peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) is the only member of the antioxidant PRDX family that translocates to damaged mitochondria, we investigated the PRDX6-mediated antisteatotic mechanism using genetically modified mice and cells.  PRDX6 mice were more protective to lipid accumulation, liver injury, and insulin resistance after a high-fat diet. Mechanistically, PRDX6 is required for induction of mitochondrial antioxidant action and beta-oxidation through maintaining mitochondrial integrity and subsequently prevents ROS-induced . Interestingly, oxidative stress-induced Notch signaling was suppressed in PRDX6 mice compared with wild-type mice, and genetic and pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling improved lipid accumulation. Finally, PRDX knockdown or Notch inhibition reduced induction of mitophagy. PRDX6 antagonizes positive feedback loop between lipid accumulation and ROS production through regulation of mitochondrial function.  For the first time, we demonstrate that PRDX6 maintains mitochondria integrity under oxidative stress and protects against NAFLD progression by inhibition of Notch signaling.  This study describes a novel molecular mechanism underlying the antisteatotic activity of PRDX6, which may be a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31376605>Illuminated night alters behaviour and negatively affects physiology and metabolism in diurnal zebra finches.</a></h2><p>Light at night (LAN) negatively impacts the behaviour and physiology; however, very little is known about molecular correlates of LAN-induced effects in diurnal animals. Here, we assessed LAN-induced effects on behaviour and physiology, and examined molecular changes in the liver of diurnal zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Birds were exposed to dim LAN (dLAN: 12L = 150 lux: 12D =  lux), with controls on 12L (150 lux): 12D (0 lux). dLAN altered daily activity-rest and eating patterns, induced nocturnal eating and caused body fattening and weight gain, and reduced nocturnal melatonin levels. Concomitant increased nighttime glucose levels, decreased daytime thyroxine and triglycerides levels, and hepatic lipid accumulation suggested the impairment of metabolism under dLAN. Transcriptional assays evidenced dLAN-induced negative effects on metabolism in the liver, the site of metabolic homeostasis. Particularly, increased g6pc and foxo1 mRNA expressions suggested an enhanced gluconeogenesis, while increased egr1 and star expressions suggested enhanced cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid metabolism, respectively. Similarly, overexpressed sirt1 indicated protection from the metabolic damage due to elevated gluconeogenesis and cholesterol biosynthesis under dLAN. However, no effect on genes involved in  (fasn) and insulin signalling pathway (socs3 and insig1) might indicate for the post transcriptional/post translational modification effects or the involvement of other genetic pathways in LAN-induced effects. We also found daily rhythm in the hepatic expression of selected clock and clock-controlled genes (per2, bmal1 and reverb-beta), with an elevated mesor and amplitude of per2 oscillation, suggesting a role of per2 in the liver metabolism. These results demonstrate dLAN-induced negative effects on the behaviour and physiology, and provide molecular insights into metabolic risks of the exposure to illuminated nights to diurnal animals including humans in an urban setting.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Meanwhile, PPARγ remarkably inhibited the stimulating effect of MARK4 on non-receptor-mediated lipid accumulation in trophoblasts.

We previously identified a pivotal role of IκB kinase α (IKK-α) in regulating cellular  and HCV assembly. In this study, we defined and characterized NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) as an IKK-α upstream serine/threonine kinase in IKK-α-mediated proviral effects and the mechanism whereby HCV exploits this innate pathway to its advantage. We manipulated NIK expression in Huh7..1 cells through loss- and gain-of-function approaches and examined the effects on IKK-α activation, cellular lipid metabolism, and viral assembly. We demonstrated that NIK interacts with IKK-α to form a kinase complex in association with the stress granules, in which IKK-α is phosphorylated upon HCV infection. Depletion of NIK significantly diminished cytosolic lipid droplet content and impaired HCV particle production. NIK overexpression enhanced HCV assembly, and this process was abrogated in cells deprived of IKK-α, suggesting that NIK acts upstream of IKK-α. NIK abundance was increased in HCV-infected hepatocytes, liver tissues from  mice engrafted with human hepatocytes, and chronic hepatitis C patients. NIK mRNA contains an miR-122 seed sequence binding site in the 3' untranslated region (UTR). miR-122 mimic and hairpin inhibitor directly affected NIK levels. In our hepatic models, miR-122 levels were significantly reduced by HCV infection. We demonstrated that HNF4A, a known transcriptional regulator of pri-miR-122, was downregulated by HCV infection. NIK represents a bona fide target of miR-122 whose transcription is downregulated by HCV through reduced HNF4A expression. This effect, together with the sequestering of miR-122 by HCV replication, results in "derepression" of NIK expression to deregulate lipid metabolism. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major global public health problem. Infection often leads to severe liver injury that may progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. HCV coopts cellular machineries for propagation and triggers pathological processes in the liver. We previously identified a pivotal role of IKK-α in regulating cellular lipid metabolism and HCV assembly. In this study, we characterized NIK as acting upstream of IKK-α and characterized how HCV exploits this innate pathway to its advantage. Through extensive mechanistic studies, we demonstrated that NIK is a direct target of miR-122, which is regulated at the transcription level by HNF4A, a hepatocyte-specific transcription factor. We show in HCV infection that NIK expression is increased while both HNF4A and miR-122 levels are decreased. NIK represents an important host dependency that links HCV assembly, hepatic , and miRNA biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199678>Sorafenib kills liver cancer cells by disrupting SCD1-mediated synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids  the ATP-AMPK-mTOR-SREBP1 signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that is effective in treating advanced liver cancer. Although its mechanism of action through several established cancer-related protein kinase targets is well-characterized, sorafenib induces variable responses among human tumors, and the cause for this variation is yet unknown. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we applied mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis to Huh7. human liver cancer cells and found that sorafenib significantly affected the expression of the key lipogenic enzymes, especially stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1), in these cells. Given that SCD1 catalyzes the most crucial and rate-limiting step in the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids (FAs), we performed a lipidomic analysis, which showed a dramatically altered lipid profile in sorafenib-treated cells. Detection and analysis of free FAs showed that the levels of monounsaturated FAs, including oleate, were significantly decreased in those cells treated by sorafenib. Addition of oleate protected liver cancer cells from sorafenib-induced death and alleviated the abnormalities of mitochondrial morphology and function caused by the drug. Treatment with sorafenib suppressed ATP production, resulting in AMPK activation  phosphorylation. Further secondary effects included reduction of the levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in liver cancer cells. These effects were partly abolished in the presence of compound C (an AMPK inhibitor) and ATP and adenosine, and SREBP1c overexpression also could be resistant to the effects of sorafenib, suggesting that the sorafenib-induced reduction in cell viability was mediated by the ATP-AMPK-mTOR-SREBP1 signaling pathway. Taken together, our results suggest that sorafenib's anticancer activity in liver cancer cells is based on the inhibition of ATP production, SCD1 expression, and monounsaturated FA synthesis. In addition, the decreased monounsaturated FA synthesis further triggered the more serious reduction of ATP production in sorafenib-treated cells. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that sorafenib disrupts  and triggers liver cancer cell death by targeting SCD1 through the ATP-AMPK-mTOR-SREBP1 pathway.-Liu, G., Kuang, S., Cao, R., Wang, J., Peng, Q., Sun, C.

Similar to other second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), aripiprazole (ARI) and cariprazine (CAR) also influence food intake, but the peripheral effects of these drugs on adipose-tissue homeostasis, including adipokine secretion as well as lipo- and , are not fully elucidated. In this study, we explored the adipocyte-related mechanisms induced by second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), leading to changes in peripheral signals involved in energy homeostasis.  CAR, a new SGA, was compared with ARI and olanzapine (OLA), using cell cultures to study , and the expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) was measured in adipocytes derived from mouse fibroblasts, by western blotting on days 7, 14, and 21 postinduction. The triglyceride (TG) content of the cells was also evaluated on day 15 using Oil Red O staining, and the adiponectin (AN) content in the cell culture supernatants was quantified on days 7 and 15 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cells were treated with two concentrations of ARI (0. and 20 µg/mL), OLA (1 and 20 µg/mL), and CAR (0.1 and 2 µg/mL).  Both concentrations of ARI and OLA, as well as the lower concentration of CAR, significantly increased the TG contents. The AN levels in the supernatants were significantly increased by the higher concentration of ARI on days 7 and 15 ( < 0.05). Although PPAR-γ levels were not significantly affected by ARI and OLA, the lower concentration of CAR induced a significant time-dependent decrease in PPAR-γ expression ( < 0.05).  The in vitro  considered from TG accumulation, AN secretion, and PPAR-γ expression was differently influenced by ARI, CAR, and OLA.

Migratory birds such as geese have a high tolerance of massive energy intake and exhibit little pathological development. Domesticated goose breeds, derivatives of the wild greyleg goose (Anser anser) or swan goose (Anser cygnoides), have high tolerance of energy intake resembling their ancestor species. Thus, goose is potentially a model species to study mechanisms associated with .Phenotypically, goose liver exhibited higher fat accumulation than adipose tissues during fattening (liver increased by 3.35 fold than 1.65 fold in adipose), showing a priority of fat accumulation in liver. We found the number of differentially expressed genes in liver (13.97%) was nearly twice the number of that in adipose (6.60%). These differentially expressed genes in liver function in several important lipid metabolism pathways, immune response, regulation of cancer, while in adipose, terms closely related to protein binding, gluconeogenesis were enriched. Typically, genes like MDH2 and SCD, which have key roles in glycolysis and fatty acids metabolism, had higher fold change in liver than in adipose tissues. Three hundred two differentially expressed long noncoding RNAs involved in regulation of metabolism in liver were also identified. For example, lncRNA XLOC_292762, which was .7 kb downstream of FERMT2, a gene involved phosphatidylinositol-3,4,-trisphosphate binding, was significantly down-regulated after the high-intake feeding period. Further investigation of documented obesity-related orthologous genes in goose suggested that understanding the evolutionary split from mammals in  will make goose fatty liver a better resource for future research.Our research reveals that goose uses liver as the major tissue to regulate a distinct lipid synthesis and degradation flux and the dynamic expression network analyses showed numerous layers of positive responses to both massive energy intake and possible pathological development. Our results offer insights into goose  and provide a new perspective for research in human metabolic dysregulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30896430>Obesity risk and preference for high dietary fat intake are determined by FTO rs9939609 gene polymorphism in selected Indonesian adults.</a></h2><p>Data suggest that genetic factors are associated with BMI. The fat mass and obesity- associated (FTO) gene modulates  through alternative splicing and m6A demethylation. Individuals with FTO rs9939609 gene polymorphism have a preference for energy-dense foods. This study investigates the relationship between FTO rs9939609 and obesity and preference for dietary fat intake among selected Indonesian adults.A total of 40 non-obese and 40 obese participants aged 19-59 living in Jakarta were recruited. Body composition measurements included body weight, height, BMI, waist circumference, and body fat mass. Dietary intake was assessed using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire and food recall over 2 × 24-h periods. Genetic variation was determined using amplification-refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction.The genotype distribution of the FTO gene (rs9939609) was at Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium (p=1) with minor allele frequency=0.19. Individuals with AT/AA genotypes had 3.72 times higher risk of obesity (p=0.009) and .98 times higher dietary fat intake (p=0.02) than those with TT genotype. Obese participants with the AT/AA genotypes had 1.40 times higher dietary fat intake than those with the TT genotype (p=0.016).These findings suggest that Indonesian adults with AT/AA genotypes of the FTO rs9939609 have higher obesity risks and preferences for high dietary fat intake than those with TT genotype.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042478>Identification of Metabolically Distinct Adipocyte Progenitor Cells in Human Adipose Tissues.</a></h2><p>Adipocyte progenitor cells (APCs) provide the reservoir of regenerative cells to produce new adipocytes, although their identity in humans remains elusive. Using FACS analysis, gene expression profiling, and metabolic and proteomic analyses, we identified three APC subtypes in human white adipose tissues. The APC subtypes are molecularly distinct but possess similar proliferative and adipogenic capacities. Adipocytes derived from APCs with high CD34 expression exhibit exceedingly high rates of lipid flux compared with APCs with low or no CD34 expression, while adipocytes produced from CD34 APCs display beige-like adipocyte properties and a unique endocrine profile. APCs were more abundant in gluteofemoral compared with abdominal subcutaneous and omental adipose tissues, and the distribution of APC subtypes varies between depots and in patients with type 2 diabetes. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the heterogeneity of human white adipose tissue and a potential basis for dysregulated adipocyte function in type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

CAR activators, including phenobarbital, are considered rodent non-genotoxic carcinogens. Recently, trans-3,4,,4´-tetramethoxystilbene(TMS), a potential anticancer drug (DMU-212), have been shown to alleviate N-nitrosodiethylamine/phenobarbital-induced liver carcinogenesis. We studied whether TMS inhibits mouse Car to protect from the PB-induced tumorigenesis. Unexpectedly, we identified TMS as a murine CAR agonist in reporter gene experiments, in mouse hepatocytes, and in C57BL/6 mice in vivo. TMS up-regulated Car target genes Cyp2b10, Cyp2c29 and Cyp2c55 mRNAs, but down-regulated expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis and . TMS did not change or down-regulate genes involved in liver proliferation or apoptosis such as Mki67, Foxm1, Myc, Mcl1, Pcna, Bcl2, or Mdm2, which were up-regulated by another Car ligand TCPOBOP. TMS did not increase liver weight and had no significant effect on Ki67 and Pcna labeling indices in mouse liver in vivo. In murine hepatic AML12 cells, we confirmed a Car-independent proapoptotic effect of TMS. We conclude that TMS is a Car ligand with limited effects on hepatocyte proliferation, likely due to promoting apoptosis in mouse hepatic cells, while controlling Car target genes involved in xenobiotic and endobiotic metabolism.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It was reported to impair preadipocyte differentiation, limit adipose tissue (AT) development and enhance white AT browning in rodents. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that these effects of butein may occur via reduction of ADAMTS5 (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase with ThromboSpondin motifs ) expression. Murine 3T3-L1 or 3T3-F442A preadipocytes were differentiated into mature adipocytes in the presence of butein or vehicle. At regular time intervals RNA was collected for gene expression studies. Male hemizygous mice for Tg(Ucp1-luc2,-tdTomato)1Kajim (ThermoMouse) were exposed to butein or vehicle, after which ATs were analyzed for Adamts5 and uncoupling protein-1 (Ucp-1) mRNA level changes. During preadipocyte differentiation, butein (25 - 50 mM) did not affect Adamts5 or Ucp-1 expression. Oil Red O analysis and monitoring of differentiation markers failed to demonstrate effects of butein on the differentiation extent. Furthermore, butein administration to the ThermoMouse (10 or 20 mg/kg, 4 days) or to the C57BL6/Rj mice (20 mg/kg, 4 weeks) did not enhance Adamts5 or Ucp-1 expression. Thus, we could not demonstrate marked effects of butein on the preadipocyte differentiation extent or AT development and browning, nor on Adamts5 or Ucp-1 gene expression during these processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168625>Sex hormone-binding globulin suppresses NAFLD-triggered hepatocarcinogenesis after menopause.</a></h2><p>It is generally accepted that androgen receptors increase the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and that estrogen reduces risk of HCC. Many studies regarding this have involved males. We, therefore, have focused our attention on females, especially postmenopausal females, who typically have limited supplies of estrogen. By using sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) transgenic mice, we produced a humanoid environment, and facilitated deposition and modulation of sex hormones. After exposure to diethylnitrosamine to induce HCC and upon reaching the age of 40 weeks, mice were fed the fat-rich diet for  months. Fat-rich diet fed or ovariectomized (OVX) wild-type mice aged 62 weeks showed HCC progression, whereas fat-rich diet fed SHBG mice or OVX SHBG mice displayed fewer tumors. In the liver of fat-rich diet fed SHBG mice, estrogenic conditions including high levels of 17β-estradiol and estrogen receptor alpha led to the induction of the  inhibitor, phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and consequently suppressed fatty liver. The presence of plasma SHBG in HCC bearing mice suppressed the levels of steatosis and inflammation in a process mediated by estrogens and estrogen receptor alpha. Conversely, in the liver of OVX SHBG mice, lipogenic inhibition was also observed under conditions where the supply of estrogens is limited. Through in vitro experiment, it was confirmed SHBG suppresses  via inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase level. In conclusion, our results show that plasma SHBG might have a clinical impact on lipid-mediated hepatic diseases.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Previous studies concluded that these exchanges are incomplete therefore fatty acid H-enrichment requires correcting.  In mice, we measured the H-enrichment of fatty acid positions 2, 3 and methyl hydrogens from [U-H]glucose to determine H-transfer from glucose to fatty acid via malonyl-CoA, NADPH and acetyl-CoA, respectively.  Positional fatty acid H-enrichments were compared to C-enrichment of the same sites from an equivalent amount of [U-C]glucose provided alongside the [U-H]glucose tracer.                   Transfer of glucose H to fatty acid position 2 and methyl sites was low (H enrichment of 0.06 ± 0.01 and 0.14 ± 0.01 relative to C) indicating extensive exchange at both malonyl- and acetyl-CoA, respectively.  Transfer of glucose H into fatty acid position 3 was more extensive (0.46 ± 0.04 relative to C, p < 10 versus position 2) indicating a more limited exchange of those glucose hydrogens that were transferred via NADPH.  However, mice provided with [U-C]glucose and HO had equivalent H-enrichments of fatty acid positions 2 and 3 suggesting that in this setting, NADPH and body water H had exchanged extensively. This is explained by contributions of substrates other than exogenous glucose to DNL coupled with their extensive H-enrichment from HO prior to DNL.  Under such conditions, H-enrichment of fatty acids from HO do not need correction.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31204236>Dietary high calories from sunflower oil, sucrose and fructose sources alters lipogenic genes expression levels in liver and skeletal muscle in rats.</a></h2><p>The objectives of this study were to investigate the underlying mechanism of PPARα, LXRα, ChREBP, and SREBP-1c at the level of gene and protein expression with high-energy diets in liver and skeletal muscle.Metabolic changes with consumption of high fat (Hfat), high sucrose (Hsuc) and high fructose (Hfru) diets were assessed.

While the expansion of subcutaneous adipose tissues (SAT) is protective in obesity, that of visceral adipose tissues (VAT) correlates with the emergence of metabolic diseases. Maintained in fat pads throughout life, adipose stem cells (ASC) are mesenchymal-like stem cells with  and multipotent differentiation potential. ASC from distinct fat pads have long been reported to present distinct proliferation and differentiation potentials that are maintained in culture, yet the origins of these intrinsic differences are still unknown. Metabolism is central to stem cell fate decision in line with environmental changes. In this study, we performed high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomic analyses of ASC culture supernatants in order to characterize their metabolic phenotype in culture. We identified and quantified 29 ASC exometabolites and evaluated their consumption or secretion over 72 h of cell culture. Both ASC used glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism, as evidenced by the high secretions of lactate and citrate, respectively, but V-ASC mostly used glycolysis. By varying the composition of the cell culture medium, we showed that glutaminolysis, rather than glycolysis, supported the secretion of pyruvate, alanine, and citrate, evidencing a peculiar metabolism in ASC cells. The comparison of the two types of ASC in glutamine-free culture conditions also revealed the role of glutaminolysis in the limitation of pyruvate routing towards the lactate synthesis, in S-ASC but not in V-ASC. Altogether, our results suggest a difference between depots in the capacity of ASC mitochondria to assimilate pyruvate, with probable consequences on their differentiation potential in pathways requiring an increased mitochondrial activity. These results highlight a pivotal role of metabolic mechanisms in the discrimination between ASC and provide new perspectives in the understanding of their functional differences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31397728> for soft tissue reconstruction.</a></h2><p>It has been increasingly common to use adipose tissue for regenerative and reconstructive purposes.

The mechanisms by which hydrogen sulfide (H2S), an endogenous gasotransmitter, regulates lipid metabolism remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate if the protective effects of H2S during high glucose (HG)‑induced lipid accumulation in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes may be mediated by AMP‑activated protein kinase (AMPK). Triglyceride (TG) content and the production of H2S were determined using  colorimetric assay kits and H2S synthesis methods. The levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein‑1 and adiponectin were evaluated by ELISA. Total AMPK and phosphorylated AMPK levels were assessed by western blot analysis. HG increased the cellular level of TG and decreased H2S production in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes. The H2S donor, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) protected against the HG‑induced accumulation of TG in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, NaHS suppressed HG‑induced TG accumulation by activating AMPK. Collectively, the findings of the present study suggested that HG induced lipid accumulation in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes, and AMPK activation may underlie the lipid‑lowering effects of H2S.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664866>LncRNA SNHG16 induces the SREBP2 to promote  and enhance the progression of pancreatic cancer.</a></h2><p> Blocking  could significantly inhibit the progression of pancreatic cancer.

Epigenetics involves a series of factors that are important for gene regulation or for chromatin structure, mostly DNA methylation and histone-tail modifications, which can be modified by environmental conditions (nutrition, lifestyle, smoking…). Since metabolic diseases like obesity and diabetes are closely related to lifestyle and nutrition, epigenetic deregulation could play an important role in the onset of these diseases and vice versa. However, little is known about histone marks in human adipose tissue. In a previous work, we developed a protocol for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of frozen human adipose tissue. By using this method, this study investigates, for the first time, the H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) mark (open chromatin) on the promoter of several factors involved in , lipid metabolism and inflammation in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from human subjects with different degrees of body mass index (BMI) and metabolic disease.VAT was collected and frozen at -80°C. 100 mg VAT samples were fixed in 0.% formaldehyde and homogenized. After sonication, the sheared chromatin was immune-precipitated with an anti-H3K4me3 antibody linked to magnetic beads and purified. H3K4me3 enrichment was analyzed by qPCR for LEP, LPL, SREBF2, SCD1, PPARG, IL6, TNF and E2F1 promoters. mRNA extraction on the same samples was performed to quantify gene expression of these genes.H3K4me3 was enriched at the promoter of E2F1, LPL, SREBF2, SCD1, PPARG and IL6 in lean normoglycemic compared to morbid obese subjects with prediabetes. Accordingly H3K4me3 mark enrichment at E2F1, LPL, SREBF2, SCD1, PPARG and IL6 promoters was positively correlated with the BMI and the HOMA-IR. Regression analysis showed a strong relationship between the BMI with H3K4me3 at the promoter of E2F1 and LPL, and with mRNA levels of LEP and SCD. In the case of HOMA-IR, the regression analysis showed associations with H3K4me3 enrichment at the promoter of SCD1 and IL6, and with the mRNA of LEP and SCD1. Moreover H3K4me3 at the E2F1 promoter was positively associated to E2F1 mRNA levels.H3K4me3 enrichment in the promoter of LEP, LPL, SREBF2, SCD1, PPARG, IL6, TNF and E2F1 is directly associated with increasing BMI and metabolic deterioration. The H3k4me3 mark could be regulating E3F1 mRNA levels in adipose tissue, while no associations between the promoter enrichment of this mark and mRNA levels existed for the other genes studied.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31442402>The Bone Marrow Protects and Optimizes Immunological Memory during Dietary Restriction.</a></h2><p>Mammals evolved in the face of fluctuating food availability. How the immune system adapts to transient nutritional stress remains poorly understood. Here, we show that memory T cells collapsed in secondary lymphoid organs in the context of dietary restriction (DR) but dramatically accumulated within the bone marrow (BM), where they adopted a state associated with energy conservation. This response was coordinated by glucocorticoids and associated with a profound remodeling of the BM compartment, which included an increase in T cell homing factors, erythropoiesis, and . Adipocytes, as well as CXCR4-CXCL12 and S1P-S1PR interactions, contributed to enhanced T cell accumulation in BM during DR.

However, no studies have demonstrated the molecular effects of short-term strength training on the accumulation of hepatic fat in obese mice. This study aimed to investigate the effects of short-term strength training on the mechanisms of oxidation and lipid synthesis in the liver of obese mice. The short duration protocol was used to avoid changing the amount of adipose tissue. Swiss mice were separated into three groups: lean control (CTL), sedentary obese (OB) and strength training obese (STO). The obese groups were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and the STO group performed the strength training protocol 1 session/day for 15 days. The short-term strength training reduced hepatic fat accumulation, increasing hepatic insulin sensitivity and controlling hepatic glucose production. The obese animals increased the mRNA of lipogenic genes Fasn and Scd1 and reduced the oxidative genes Cpt1a and Ppara. On the other hand, the STO group presented the opposite results. Finally, the obese animals presented higher levels of lipogenic proteins (ACC and FAS) and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β), but the short-term strength training was efficient in reducing this condition, regardless of body weight loss. In conclusion, there was a reduction of obesity-related hepatic  and inflammation after short-term strength training, independent of weight loss, leading to improvements in hepatic insulin sensitivity and glycemic homeostasis in obese mice. Key points: (1) Short-term strength training (STST) reduced fat accumulation and inflammation in the liver; (2) Hepatic insulin sensitivity and HPG control were increased with STST; (3) The content and activity of ACC and content of FAS were reduced with STST; (4) STST improved hepatic fat accumulation and glycemic homeostasis; () STST effects were observed independently of body weight change.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880626>Prostaglandin F2-Alpha Eye Drops (Bimatoprost) in Graves' Orbitopathy: A Randomized Controlled Double-Masked Crossover Trial (BIMA Trial).</a></h2><p>Previous in vitro experiments have demonstrated that prostaglandin F2-alpha (PF) reduced proliferation and  in a murine cell line and human orbital fibroblasts derived from subjects with inactive Graves' orbitopathy (GO). The objective of this study was to determine if the PGF analogue bimatoprost is effective at reducing proptosis in this population.A randomized controlled double-masked crossover trial was conducted in a single tertiary care academic medical center. Patients with long-standing, inactive GO but persistent proptosis (>20 mm in at least one eye) were recruited. Allowing for a 15% dropout rate, 31 patients (26 females) were randomized in order to identify a treatment effect of 2.0 mm (p = 0.05; power 0.88). Following informed consent, participants were randomized to receive bimatoprost or placebo for three months, after which they underwent a two-month washout before switching to the opposite treatment. The primary outcome was the change in exophthalmometry readings over the two three-month treatment periods.The mean exophthalmometer at baseline was 23.6 mm (range 20.0-30. mm), and the mean age of the patients was 55 years (range 28-74 years). The median duration of GO was 7.6 years (interquartile range 3.6-12.3 years). The majority were still suffering from diplopia (61.3%) with bilateral involvement (61.3%). Using multi-level modeling adjusted for baseline, period, and carry-over, bimatoprost resulted in a -0.17 mm (reduction) exophthalmometry change ([confidence interval -0.67 to +0.32]; p = 0.490). There was a mean change in intraocular pressure of -2.7 mmHg ([confidence interval -4.0 to -1.4]; p = 0.0070). One patient showed periorbital fat atrophy on treatment, which resolved on stopping treatment. Independent analysis of proptosis by photographic images (all subjects) and subgroup analysis on monocular disease (n = 12) did not show any apparent benefit.In inactive GO, bimatoprost treatment over a three-month period does not result in an improvement in proptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31422916>Drosophila Snazarus Regulates a Lipid Droplet Population at Plasma Membrane-Droplet Contacts in Adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Adipocytes store nutrients as lipid droplets (LDs), but how they organize their LD stores to balance lipid uptake, storage, and mobilization remains poorly understood. Here, using Drosophila fat body (FB) adipocytes, we characterize spatially distinct LD populations that are maintained by different lipid pools. We identify peripheral LDs (pLDs) that make close contact with the plasma membrane (PM) and are maintained by lipophorin-dependent lipid trafficking. pLDs are distinct from larger cytoplasmic medial LDs (mLDs), which are maintained by FASN1-dependent de novo . We find that sorting nexin CG1514 or Snazarus (Snz) associates with pLDs and regulates LD homeostasis at ER-PM contact sites. Loss of SNZ perturbs pLD organization, whereas Snz over-expression drives LD expansion, triacylglyceride production, starvation resistance, and lifespan extension through a DESAT1-dependent pathway. We propose that Drosophila adipocytes maintain spatially distinct LD populations and identify Snz as a regulator of LD organization and inter-organelle crosstalk.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Stem cells are widely recognized as potential tools for use in the development of novel therapeutic strategies. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of demographic factors on adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation in bone marrow-derived stem cell (BMSC) spheroids. Age- and gender-associated alterations in the adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation potential of BMSCs were examined. Human BMSCs were isolated from male and female participants in their 20s, 30s and 50s. Cell morphology and relative values of  and chondrogenesis were examined by measuring the relative intensity of oil red O and Alcian blue staining, respectively. Cell morphology alterations in BMSCs isolated from male and female participants in their 20s, 30s and 50s and grown in adipogenic media were very similar. In addition, there were no significant differences in the relative values of  in BMSCs for the 20s, 30s and 50s age groups on day 8 and 16. Similarly, no significant differences were observed in the relative values of  in BMSCs for the male and female groups on day 8 and 16. Cell morphology changes in BMSCs isolated from male and female participants in their 20s, 30s and 50s and grown in chondrogenic media were very similar. In addition, there were no significant differences in the relative values of chondrogenesis in BMSCs for the 20s, 30s and 50s age groups on day 8, however there was a significant difference observed in the relative values of chondrogenesis in BMSCs on day 16 for the 30s and 50s age groups, compared with the 20s age group. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed in the relative values of  in BMSCs for the male and female groups on day 8 and 16. The current study demonstrated that there were no significant differences in the adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation potential of BMSCs isolated from healthy male donors vs. healthy female donors. Similarly, no significant differences were observed in the adipogenic differentiation potential of BMSCs isolated from different age groups on day 8. However, there was a significant increase in the chondrogenic differentiation potential of BMSCs isolated from participants in their 30s and 50s, compared with BMSCs isolated from participants in their 20s on day 16.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31133421>Betulinic acid lowers lipid accumulation in adipocytes through enhanced NCoA1-PPARγ interaction.</a></h2><p>Investigation for a naturally occurring anti-obesity drug has become the need of society all over the world. Betulinic acid (BA) is a lupane-type pentacyclic triterpene and is sourced from various organisms. This high potential biologically active molecule is reported to have anti-obesity effect. In this study, we report the molecular mechanism of action of BA that underlies anti-obesity activity and also an improved method of its isolation common teak tree.Mouse pre-adipocyte cells were used to develop hyperlipidemic conditions in vitro. Change in expression of genes associated to  was checked using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Co-factor specificity of PPAR gamma was analyzed through immune precipitation and immunoblot.Betulinic acid was found to be effective in reducing the lipid content in 3T3L1 cells. Level of PPAR gamma and LXR alpha was reduced in connection to reduced . Change in steroid responsive co-activators (SRCs) during BA treatment proved that the compound can impart profound change in co-factor selectivity, which is crucial in determining the activity profile of PPAR gamma.

Since obesity increases risk of chronic diseases, it is important to inhibit excessive storage of fat. Zaluzanin C is a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from . The aim of this study was to demonstrate the effect of zaluzanin C on differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes.The cytotoxicity of zaluzanin C and its effect on cell proliferation was determined. For the induction of adipocyte differentiation, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with differentiating medium containing 10 μg/mL insulin, 115 μg/mL methylisobutylxanthine, and 1 μM dexamethasone. Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were subjected to Oil red O solution or used for Western blot analysis. Zaluzanin C was added to the cell culture medium at concentrations of 0, 1, 2., , and 10 μM.Zaluzanin C did not inhibit cell proliferation and showed no cytotoxicity at 10 μM concentration in 3T3-L1 cells. Therefore, concentration range of 0-10 μM zaluzanin C was used for subsequent experiments. Zaluzanin C inhibited accumulation of lipid droplets in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To understand the underlying mechanism of zaluzanin C, expression of  regulators was determined by Western blot analysis. Zaluzanin C suppressed peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) expression, an  related transcription factor, and inhibited aP2/fatty acid-binding protein-4 expression, a target gene of PPARγ. However, it did not affect expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha related with acquisition of insulin sensitivity.These data suggest that inhibitory effect of zaluzanin C on  of 3T3-L1 adipocytes could be partially caused by suppressing PPARγ.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154900>Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting Is More Potent to Fish Intervertebral Disk Progenitor Cells Than Magnetic and Beads-Based Methods.</a></h2><p>Low back pain related to intervertebral disk (IVD) degeneration has a major socioeconomic impact on our aging society. Therefore, stem cell therapy to activate self-repair of the IVD remains an exciting treatment strategy. In this respect, tissue-specific progenitors may play a crucial role in IVD regeneration, as these cells are perfectly adapted to this niche. Such a rare progenitor cell population residing in the nucleus pulposus (NP) (NP progenitor cells [NPPCs]) was found positive for the angiopoietin-1 receptor (Tie2+), and was demonstrated to possess self-renewal capacity and  multipotency. Here, we compared three sorting protocols; that is, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS), and a mesh-based label-free cell sorting system (pluriSelect), with respect to cell yield, potential to form colonies (colony-forming units), and  functional differentiation assays for tripotency. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the efficiency of three widespread cell sorting methods for picking rare cells (<%) and how these isolated cells then behave in downstream functional differentiation in , osteogenesis, and chondrogenesis. The cell yields among the isolation methods differed widely, with FACS presenting the highest yield (.0% ± 4.0%), followed by MACS (1.6% ± 2.9%) and pluriSelect (1.1% ± 1.0%). The number of colonies formed was not significantly different between Tie2+ and Tie2- NPPCs. Only FACS was able to separate into two functionally different populations that showed trilineage multipotency, while MACS and pluriSelect failed to maintain a clear separation between Tie2+ and Tie2- populations in differentiation assays. To conclude, the isolation of NPPCs was possible with all three sorting methods, while FACS was the preferred technique for separation of functional Tie2+ cells. Impact Statement Tissue-specific progenitor cells such as nucleus pulposus progenitor cells of the IVD could become an ultimate cell source for tissue engineering strategies as these cells are presumably best adapted to the tissue's microenvironment. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting seemed to outcompete magnetic-activated cell sorting and pluriSelect concerning selecting a rare cell population from IVD tissue as could be demonstrated by improved cell yield and functional differentiation assays.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31488120>Novel discovery of Averrhoa bilimbi ethanolic leaf extract in the stimulation of brown fat differentiation program in combating diet-induced obesity.</a></h2><p>Brown adipocytes are known to promote energy expenditure and limit weight gain to combat obesity. Averrhoa bilimbi, locally called belimbing buluh (DBB), is mainly used as an ethnomedicine in the treatment of metabolic disorders including diabetes mellitus, hypertension and obesity. The present study aims to investigate the browning activity on white adipocytes by A. bilimbi leaf extract and to evaluate the potential mechanisms.Ethanolic leaf extract of A. bilimbi was exposed to Myf5 lineage precursor cells to stimulate adipocyte differentiation. Protein expressions of brown adipocyte markers were determined through high content screening analysis and validated through western blotting. Mito Stress Test assay was conducted to evaluate the cellular oxygen consumption rate upon A. bilimbi treatment.A. bilimbi ethanolic leaf extract exhibited an  effect similar to a PPARgamma agonist. It also demonstrated brown adipocyte differentiation in myoblastic Myf5-positive precursor cells. Expression of UCP1 and PRDM16 were induced. The basal metabolic rate and respiratory capacity of mitochondria were increased upon A. bilimbi treatment.The findings suggest that Averrhoa bilimbi ethanolic leaf extract induces adipocyte browning through PRDM16 activation and enhances mitochondria activity due to UCP1 up-regulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624706>Three-Dimensional Spheroid Formation of Cryopreserved Human Dental Follicle-Derived Stem Cells Enhances Pluripotency and Osteogenic Induction Properties.</a></h2><p>Enhancement and maintenance of the stemness of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is one of the most important factors contributing to the successful  therapeutic application of these cells. In this regard, three-dimensional (3D) spheroid formation has been developed as reliable method for increasing the pluripotency of MSCs. Moreover, using a new protocol, we have previously shown that dental tissues of extracted wisdom teeth can be effectively cryopreserved for subsequent use as a source of autologous stem cells. The main purpose of this study is to analyze the stemness and  osteogenic differentiation potential of 3D spheroid dental MSCs compared with conventional mono-layer cultured MSCs.In this study, MSC-characterized stem cells were isolated and cultured from long-term cryopreserved dental follicles (hDFSCs), and then 2D hDFSCs were cultured under 3D spheroid-forming conditions using a newly designed microchip dish. The spheroids (3D hDFSCs) thus produced were investigated and characterized with respect to stemness, MSC marker expression, apoptosis, cell cycle analysis, extracellular matrix (ECM) production, and osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation properties.In terms of MSC and senescence markers, spheroid cells showed no difference when compared with 2D hDFSCs; however, 3D hDFSCs were observed to have a higher proportion of cell cycle arrest and a larger number of apoptotic cells. Moreover, spheroids showed substantially increased levels of pluripotency marker (early transcription factors) and ECM protein expression. Compared with 2D hDFSCs, there was also a notable enhancement in the osteogenic induction potential of spheroids, although no differences were observed with respect to  .To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the application of a spheroid culture system for dental follicle-derived stem cells using a microchip dish. Although further studies are needed, including  transplantation, the results obtained in this study indicate that spheroid hDFSCs derived from cryopreserved dental follicle tissues could be used as a valuable source of autologous stem cells for bone tissue regeneration.© The Korean Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine Society 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31208033>Chrysanthemum Leaf Ethanol Extract Prevents Obesity and Metabolic Disease in Diet-Induced Obese Mice via Lipid Mobilization in White Adipose Tissue.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of  Ramat. against obesity and diabetes, by comparing the transcriptional changes in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) with those of the bioactive compound in , luteolin (LU). Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a normal diet, high-fat diet (HFD), and HFD supplemented with 1.% w/w chrysanthemum leaf ethanol extract (CLE) for 16 weeks. Supplementation with CLE and LU significantly decreased the body weight gain and eWAT weight by stimulating mRNA expressions for thermogenesis and energy expenditure in eWAT via lipid mobilization, which may be linked to the attenuation of dyslipidemia. Furthermore, CLE and LU increased uncoupling protein-1 protein expression in brown adipose tissue, leading to energy expenditure. Of note, CLE and LU supplements enhanced the balance between lipid storage and mobilization in white adipose tissue (WAT), in turn, inhibiting adipocyte inflammation and lipotoxicity of peripheral tissues. Moreover, CLE and LU attenuated hepatic steatosis by suppressing hepatic , thereby ameliorating insulin resistance and dyslipidemia.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanism and therapeutic prospect of berberine in the treatment of NASH-HCC mice. Combination of STZ injection and high fat and high-cholesterol diet (HFHC) was used to establish NASH-HCC model. The effect of berberine intervention is studied from histology, biochemistry and molecular level. Our results showed that administration of berberine to NASH-HCC mice reduced the incidence of tumors and mitigated NASH. Berberine significantly reduced the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), glucose (GLU), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol (TC). Transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis identified numberous genes and various pathways may participate in the favorite effect of berberine. Specifically, berberine suppressed the expressions of genes related to , inflammation, fibrosis and angiogenesis. Moreover, our results showed that berberine suppressed phosphorylation of p38MAPK and ERK as well as COX2 expression significantly. This suggested berberine achieved its biological functions mainly by regulating inflammation and angiogenesis genes involving p38MAPK/ERK-COX2 pathways. This study demonstrated the anti-tumor effects of berberine and its possible mechanism, providing a potential drug for treating NASH-HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299104>Osajin displays potential antiprostate cancer efficacy via impairment of fatty acid synthase and androgen receptor expression.</a></h2><p>Currently, antiprostate cancer (PCa) drugs, including androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), are initially effective; however, most patients with PCa who receive ADT eventually progress to deadly aggressiveness.

Apoptosis was assessed by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining, caspase enzymatic activity, and Western blot analyses.Osajin inhibited fatty acid synthase (FASN) expression, a key enzyme for , in PCa cells. By inhibiting FASN, osajin decreased the fatty-acid levels and lipid accumulation. Significantly, osajin downregulated androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in PCa cells. Moreover, osajin suppressed PCa cell growth, migration, and invasion. Through activation of the caspase-dependent pathway, osajin induced apoptosis in PCa cells.These data provide a novel molecular basis of osajin in PCa cells, and cotargeting  and the AR axis via impairment of FASN and AR expression by osajin could be applied as a new and promising approach for the treatment of malignant PCa.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096072>Quercetin and its derivative Q2 modulate chromatin dynamics in  and Q2 prevents obesity and metabolic disorders in rats.</a></h2><p>Recently the attention of the scientific community has focused on the ability of polyphenols to counteract adverse epigenetic regulation involved in the development of complex conditions such as obesity. The aim of this study was to investigate the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the anti-adiposity effect of Quercetin (3,3',4',,7-pentahydroxyflavone) and of one of its derivatives, Q2 in which the OH groups have been replaced by acetyl groups. In 3 T3-L1 preadipocytes, Quercetin and Q2 treatment induce chromatin remodeling and histone modifications at the ' regulatory region of the two main adipogenic genes, c/EBPα and PPARγ. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed a concomitant increase of histone H3 di-methylation at Lys9, a typical mark of repressed gene promoters, and a decrease of histone H3 di-methylation at Lys 4, a mark of active transcription. At the same time, both compounds inhibited histone demethylase LSD1 recruitment to the ' region of c/EBPα and PPARγ genes, a necessary step for . The final effect is a significant reduction in c/EBPα and PPARγ gene expression and attenuated . Q2 supplementation in rats reduced the gain in body weight and in white adipose tissue, as well as the increase in adipocyte size determined by high fat diet. Moreover, Q2 improved dyslipidemia, glucose tolerance and decreased the hepatic lipid accumulation by activating the expression of beta-oxidation related genes. Our data suggest that Q2, as well as Quercetin, has the potential to revert the unfavorable epigenomic profiles associated with obesity onset.

In this study, we found that HFD increased the weight of final body, inguinal white adipose tissues (iWAT), epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) and perirenal white adipose tissue (pWAT), as well as the adipocyte mean area of iWAT and eWAT in mice (P < 0·05), whereas sodium propionate treatment reduced the weight of iWAT and pWAT as well as adipocyte mean area of iWAT in mice fed a HFD (P < 0·05). Moreover, in the iWAT, the mRNA expression of  genes, including peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1β, was upregulated by HFD challenge (P < 0·05), and the elevation of these genes was nearly reversed to the level of control diet-fed mice by sodium propionate treatment. Meanwhile, sodium propionate treatment increased the hormone-sensitive lipase mRNA expression in the iWAT of HFD-fed mice (P < 0·05). High-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA demonstrated that sodium propionate treatment significantly recovered the gut microbiota dysbiosis in HFD-fed mice, including the richness and diversity of microbiota and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. Furthermore, the HFD-induced reductions in colonic levels of butyrate and valerate were reversed by sodium propionate treatment, which also normalized the serum LPS level seen in HFD-fed mice to the levels of the control diet-fed mice.Collectively, these results indicated that sodium propionate treatment could improve lipid metabolism in HFD-fed mice, and the potential mechanisms might be via regulating gut microbiota.We demonstrated for the first time that oral sodium propionate significantly improved HFD-induced dysbiosis of gut microbiota, indicating that the mitigative effect of propionate for HFD-induced lipid dysmetabolism might be mediated by gut microbiota in mice.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480627>Lyophilized Maqui () Berry Induces Browning in the Subcutaneous White Adipose Tissue and Ameliorates the Insulin Resistance in High Fat Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>Maqui () berry features a unique profile of anthocyanidins that includes high amounts of delphinidin-3-O-sambubioside--O-glucoside and delphinidin-3-O-sambubioside and has shown positive effects on fasting glucose and insulin levels in humans and murine models of type 2 diabetes and obesity.

Our goal was to dissect the mechanisms involved. Approach and Results: We assessed the effects of exposure to air pollution on lipid metabolism in mice through assessment of plasma lipids and lipoproteins, oxidized fatty acids 9-HODE (9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic) and 13-HODE (13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic), lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism. Findings were corroborated, and mechanisms were further assessed in HepG2 hepatocytes in culture. ApoE knockout mice exposed to inhaled diesel exhaust (DE, 6 h/d,  days/wk for 16 weeks) exhibited elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increased hepatic triglyceride content, and higher hepatic levels of 9-HODE and 13-HODE, as compared to control mice exposed to filtered air. A direct effect of DE exposure on hepatocytes was demonstrated by treatment of HepG2 cells with a methanol extract of DE particles followed by loading with oleic acid. As observed in vivo, this led to increased triglyceride content and significant downregulation of ACAD9 mRNA expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with DE particles and oleic acid did not alter de novo  but inhibited total, mitochondrial, and ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment of isolated mitochondria, prepared from mouse liver, with DE particles and oleic acid also inhibited mitochondrial complex activity and β-oxidation.DE exposure leads to dyslipidemia and liver steatosis in ApoE knockout mice, likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased lipid catabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31137508> (L.)

The present study aims to investigate the toxic effects of prenatal exposure to pure glyphosate or Roundup on lipid metabolism in offspring. During gestational days (GDs), ICR mice (from Institute of Cancer Research) were given distilled water, 0.% glyphosate solution (w/v, 0. g/100 ml) or 0.%-glyphosate Roundup solution orally. The livers and serum samples of the offspring were collected on gestational day 19 (GD19), postnatal day 7 (PND7) and PND21. The results showed a significant decrease in the body weight and obvious hepatic steatosis with excessive lipid droplet formation in offspring. Moreover, the concentrations of lipids such as triglycerides (TGs), total cholesterol (T-CHO), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterols (LDL-C) increased to a significant extent in both the serum and livers. Furthermore, there were significant differences in the expression levels of the genes SREBP1C, SREBP2, Fasn, Hmgcr, Hmgcs and PPARα, which are related to lipid biosynthesis or catabolism in the liver.

In , the TG lipase Brummer is centrally important for body fat mobilization. Its gene  () encodes the ortholog of mammalian adipose TG lipase, which becomes activated by α/β-hydrolase domain-containing  (ABHD5/CGI-58), one member of the paralogous gene pair, α/β-hydrolase domain-containing 4 () and  In , the  () gene encodes the single sequence-related protein to mammalian ABHD4/ABHD5 with unknown function. We generated  deletion mutant flies, that were short-lived as a result of lipid metabolism changes, stored excess body fat at the expense of glycogen, and exhibited ectopic fat storage with altered TG FA profile in the fly kidneys, called Malpighian tubules. TG accumulation in  mutants was not associated with increased food intake but with elevated ; starvation-induced lipid mobilization remained functional. Despite its structural similarity to mammalian ABHD5, Puml did not stimulate TG lipase activity of Bmm in vitro. Rather, Puml acted as a phospholipase that localized on lipid droplets, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. Together, these results show that the ABHD4/ family member Puml is a versatile phospholipase that regulates  body fat storage and energy metabolism.Copyright © 2019 Hehlert et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31256364>Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) suppresses high Ca-enhanced  in bone marrow stromal cells.</a></h2><p>We have previously reported that increased extracellular and intracellular Ca lead to adipocyte accumulation in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). However, strategies to suppress high Ca-enhanced adipocyte accumulation have not been reported. We examined the effects of the diacylglycerol analog phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) on proliferation and  of mouse primary BMSCs. We used 9 mM CaCl and 100 nM ionomycin to increase extracellular Ca and intracellular Ca, respectively. PMA suppressed the expression of both C/EBPα and PPARγ under normal ,  + CaCl, and  + ionomycin conditions.

As well as this, many genes associated with tumors are shown to have an important role in control of the metabolism. The incidence of prostate cancer (PCa) is increased in men with metabolic disorders. In particular, obesity is an established risk factor for PCa. An increased body mass index correlates with aggressive disease, and a higher risk of biochemical recurrence and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Increased  is also one of the most significant events in PCa metabolism reprogramming. Areas covered: In this article, we provide an updated review of the current understanding of the PCa metabolome and evaluate the possibility of unveiling novel therapeutic targets. Expert opinion: Obesity is an established risk factor for PCa, and an increased BMI correlates with aggressive disease, and a higher risk of biochemical recurrence and prostate cancer-specific mortality. PCa metabolome is characterized by the accumulation of metabolic intermediates and an increased expression of genes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the induction of de novo  and cholesterogenesis. PCa cells can induce different alterations in their microenvironment by modulating the crosstalk between cancer and stromal cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31470850>Raloxifene inhibits adipose tissue inflammation and  through Wnt regulation in ovariectomized rats and 3 T3-L1 cells.</a></h2><p>Loss of ovarian function, as in menopause or after ovariectomy (OVX), is closely associated with obesity and white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation. Estrogen replacement protects against postmenopausal obesity but increases the risks of carcinogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the effects of long-term treatment of raloxifene (RAL), a selective estrogen receptor modulator, on the features of estrogen deficiency-induced obesity and explored the involvement of canonical and non-canonical Wnt regulation in vivo and in vitro.Adult female rats received bilateral OVX and divided into  groups: (1) Sham, (2) OVX, (3) OVX + E: OVX rats were administered with E (50 μg/kg, s.c., 3 times/week), (4) OVX + RAL: OVX rats were treated with RAL (gavage, 1 mg/kg/day) suspended in 0.8% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), () OVX + CMC: 0.8% CMC as vehicle control. All treatments were given for 8 weeks beginning at 1 week after OVX. In 3 T3-L1 cells, the effects of RAL on  and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation were evaluated.Treatment with RAL significantly decreased body weight, visceral fat pad mass, adipocyte size and plasma levels of glucose but increased plasma adiponectin. RAL reduced the elevation of HIF-1α, VEGF-A and proinflammatory cytokines (MCP-1 and TNF-α) expression by inhibition of NF-κB p65 and JNK cascades in retroperitoneal WAT. This anti-inflammatory capacity of RAL may result from upregulation of secreted frizzle-related protein  (SFRP5), an adipokine that repressed Wnt5a signaling. Furthermore, RAL inhibited adipogenic factors such as PPAR-γ, C/EBP-α, and FABP4, and preserved canonical Wnt10b/β-catenin protein expression. In 3 T3-L1 adipocytes, RAL (20 μM) diminished lipid accumulation and inhibited adipogenic factors accompanied with the induction of β-catenin, which were effectively reversed by the β-catenin inhibitor IWR-1-endo. In addition, RAL reduced LPS-induced NF-κB p65 and p-IκB expression as well as TNF-α secretion. Suppression of SFRP5 by small interfering RNA significantly abrogated the anti-inflammatory effects of RAL.Distinct activation of canonical β-catenin on inhibition of  and non-canonical SFRP5 on suppression of WAT inflammation may contribute to the beneficial effects of RAL. Therefore, this study provides a rationale for the therapeutic potential of RAL for postmenopausal obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31144719>Intrinsic High Aerobic Capacity in Male Rats Protects Against Diet-Induced Insulin Resistance.</a></h2><p>Low aerobic capacity increases the risk for insulin resistance but the mechanisms are unknown. In this study, we tested susceptibility to acute (3-day) high-fat, high-sucrose diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance in male rats selectively bred for divergent intrinsic aerobic capacity, that is, high-capacity running (HCR) and low-capacity running (LCR) rats. We employed hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, tracers, and transcriptome sequencing of skeletal muscle to test whether divergence in aerobic capacity impacted insulin resistance through systemic and tissue-specific metabolic adaptations. An HFD evoked decreased insulin sensitivity and insulin signaling in muscle and liver in LCR rats, whereas HCR rats were protected. An HFD led to increased glucose transport in skeletal muscle (twofold) of HCR rats while increasing glucose transport into adipose depots of the LCR rats (twofold). Skeletal muscle transcriptome revealed robust differences in the gene profile of HCR vs LCR on low-fat diet and HFD conditions, including robust differences in specific genes involved in lipid metabolism, , and differentiation. HCR transcriptional adaptations to an acute HFD were more robust than for LCR and included genes driving mitochondrial energy metabolism. In conclusion, intrinsic aerobic capacity robustly impacts systemic and skeletal muscle adaptations to HFD-induced alterations in insulin resistance, an effect that is likely driven by baseline differences in oxidative capacity, gene expression profile, and transcriptional adaptations to an HFD.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31387271>Relationship of the Phytochemicals from Coffee and Cocoa By-Products with their Potential to Modulate Biomarkers of Metabolic Syndrome In Vitro.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to compare the phytochemicals from coffee and cocoa by-products and their relationship with the potential for reducing markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, , and insulin resistance in vitro. We characterized the phytochemical profile of extracts from coffee husk, coffee silverskin, and cocoa shell and evaluated their in vitro biological activity in RAW264.7 macrophages and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Pearson correlations and principal component regressions were performed to find the contribution of phytochemicals and underlying mechanisms of action. Coffee husk and silverskin extracts were mainly composed of caffeine and chlorogenic acid. Major components in cocoa shell included theobromine and protocatechuic acid. Both coffee and cocoa by-product extracts effectively reduced inflammatory markers in macrophages and adipocytes (NO, PGE, TNF-α, MCP-1, and IL-6) and the production of reactive oxygen species (21.-66.4%). Protocatechuic and chlorogenic acids, together with caffeine, were suggested as main contributors against inflammation and oxidative stress. Furthermore, extracts reduced lipid accumulation (4.1-49.1%) in adipocytes by regulating lipolysis and inducing adipocyte browning. Gallic and chlorogenic acids were associated with reduced , and caffeine with adipocyte browning. Extracts from coffee and cocoa by-products also modulated the phosphorylation of insulin receptor signaling pathway and stimulated GLUT-4 translocation (52.4-72.9%), increasing glucose uptake. The insulin-sensitizing potential of the extracts was mainly associated with protocatechuic acid. For the first time, we identified the phytochemicals from coffee and cocoa by-products and offered new insights into their associations with biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, , and insulin resistance in vitro.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30945346>Transcriptional regulation of bovine elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 6 in lipid metabolism and adipocyte proliferation.</a></h2><p>The elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 6 (ELOVL6) gene encodes a key enzyme that plays a role in  through the catalytic elongation of both saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Previous studies have described the high expression of bovine ELOVL6 in adipose tissues. However, transcriptional regulation and the functional role of ELOVL6 in lipid metabolism and adipocyte proliferation remain unexplored. Here, a 1. kb fragment of the '-untranslated region promoter region of ELOVL6 was amplified from the genomic DNA of Qinchuan cattle and sequenced. The core promoter region was identified through unidirectional '-end deletion of the promoter plasmid vector. In silico analysis predicted important transcription factors that were then validated through site-directed mutation and small interfering RNA interference with an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. We found that the binding of KLF6 and PU.1 transcription factors occurred in the region -168/+69. Both perform a vital regulatory function in the transcription of bovine ELOVL6. Overexpression of ELOVL6 significantly upregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ), but inhibited the expression of fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), while silencing of ELOVL6 negatively regulated the messenger RNA expression level of PPARγ, FABP4, ACSL, and FATP1. In addition, ELOVL6 promotes adipocyte proliferation by regulating the cell-cycle genes' expression. Taken together, these findings provide useful information about the transcriptional regulation and functional mechanisms of bovine ELOVL6 in lipid metabolism and adipocyte proliferation in Qinchuan cattle.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606201>CCN1 induces adipogenic differentiation of fibro/adipogenic progenitors in a chronic kidney disease model.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have shown that sarcopenic obesity is highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Here, the association between CKD and sarcopenic obesity were investigated. The /6 nephrectomy was performed to establish CKD in mice. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), quantitative real-time PCR, ELISA kits assay, immunohistochemistry, and cell proliferation assay were carried out to investigate the condition of muscle loss and fatty infiltration were in CKD mice and the origin of adipocytes. Muscle atrophy occurred and adipogenic gene expression, Perilipin and FABP4 were markedly increased in the hind limb muscle of CKD mice. Results indicated that fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) are the precursor of adipocytes in the muscle of CKD mice. Meanwhile, the content of extracellular matrix protein CCN1 was notably increased in serum of CKD patients with sarcopenic obesity which was also found in muscle and serum of CKD mice. CCN1 induced the differentiation of FAPs into adipocytes. These results suggest that CKD mice are susceptible to sarcopenic obesity. CCN1 may be a novel activator of the differentiation of FAPs in CKD muscle.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The complex chemical mixtures that humans and wildlife are exposed to include a number of compounds that may have obesogenic properties. In this study we examined a mixture consisting of phthalate-monoesters, triclosan, and perfluorinated compounds. The mixture was designed within the EDC-MixRisk project based on serum levels of the compounds in pregnant women of a Swedish mother-child cohort. The compounds were negatively associated with birth weight of the children. We assessed whether developmental exposure to this mixture in combination with a calorie-rich diet affected metabolic rate, blood lipids,  and lipid storage, and the whole-body level of neutral lipids in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Wildtype zebrafish were exposed to the mixture from 3 h post fertilization to , 14 or 17 days post fertilization (dpf) at water concentrations corresponding to 1, 10, 20, or 100 times the geometrical mean of the serum concentration (hsc) in the women. Exposure to the mixture at 20 times hsc lowered metabolic rate at 2- dpf, and increased the number of adipocytes and the amount of visceral adipose tissue at 14 and 17 dpf respectively. Also, mRNA expression of fatty acid binding protein 11a was increased at 17 dpf by 10 and 20 times hsc of the mixture. This study shows that a human-relevant mixture of environmental pollutants affects metabolic rate,  and lipid storage in young zebrafish fed a calorie-rich diet, thus demonstrating its potential to disrupt metabolism.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

High dietary lipid intake leads to fat deposition in the intestine and adversely influences fat absorption and health, but the underlying mechanism is unknown.We used yellow catfish and their isolated intestinal epithelial cells to test the hypothesis that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, autophagy, and apoptosis mediate fat-induced changes in lipid metabolism.Male and female yellow catfish (weight: 3.79 ± 0.16 g; age: 3 mo) were fed diets containing lipid at 6.98% (low-fat diet; LFD), 11.3% (middle-fat diet; MFD), or 15.4% (high-fat diet; HFD) (by weight) for 8 wk. Each dietary group had 3 replicates, 30 fish per replicate. Their intestinal epithelial cells were isolated and incubated for 24 h in control solution or various concentrations of fatty acids (FAs) with or without 2-h pretreatment with an inhibitor [3-methyladenine (3-MA), 4-phenyl butyric acid (4-PBA), or Ac-DVED-CHO (AC)]. Triglyceride (TG) contents, genes, and enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, ER stress, autophagy, and apoptosis were determined in intestinal tissue and cells; immunoblotting, BODIPY 493/503 staining, ultrastructural observation, and the detection of autophagic and apoptotic vesicles were performed on intestinal cells.Compared with the LFD and MFD, the HFD increased intestinal TG content by 120-226%, activities of lipogenic enzymes by 19.0-245%, expression of genes related to  (0.77-8.4-fold), lipolysis (0.36-6.0-fold), FA transport proteins (0.79-1.7-fold), ER stress (0.55-7.-fold), autophagy (0.56-4.2-fold), and apoptosis (0.80-.2-fold). Using isolated intestinal epithelial cells and inhibitors (4-PBA, 3-MA, and AC), we found that ER stress mediated FA-induced activation of autophagy (11.0-50.1%) and apoptosis (10.4-32.0%), and lipophagy and apoptosis mediated FA-induced lipolysis (3.40-41.6%).An HFD upregulated , lipolysis, and FA transport, induced ER stress, and activated autophagy and apoptosis.

Blood alcohol concentration (BAC), liver injury marker (alanine amino transferase (ALT)), hepatic lipids and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) activity were measured. Liver histology, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling and cell death proteins were evaluated. Significantly increased BAC, plasma ALT, hepatic lipids and steatosis were found only in ADH deer mice fed 3.% EtOH. Further, a significant ER stress and increased un-spliced X-box binding protein 1 were evident only in ADH deer mice fed 3.% EtOH. Both strains fed 3.% EtOH showed deactivation of AMPK, but increased acetyl Co-A carboxylase 1 and decreased carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A favoring  were found only in ADH deer mice fed 3.% EtOH.

How alcohol stimulates 2-AG production in HSCs is unknown. Here, we report that chronic alcohol consumption induced hepatic cysteine deficiency and subsequent glutathione depletion by impaired transsulfuration pathway. A compensatory increase in hepatic cystine-glutamate anti-porter xCT boosted extracellular glutamate levels coupled to cystine uptake both in mice and in patients with ALD. Alcohol also induced the selective expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor- (mGluR5) in HSCs where mGluR5 activation stimulated 2-AG production. Consistently, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of mGluR5 or xCT attenuated alcoholic steatosis in mice via the suppression of 2-AG production and subsequent CBR-mediated de novo . We conclude that a bidirectional signaling operates at a metabolic synapse between hepatocytes and HSCs through xCT-mediated glutamate-mGluR5 signaling to produce 2-AG, which induces CBR-mediated alcoholic steatosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Comparing the biological and transcriptome gene characteristics of MSCs from different sources provides an important basis for the screening of clinically used cells. The main purpose of this experiment was to establish methods for the isolation and culture of MSCs from five different canine sources, including adipose tissue, bone marrow, umbilical cord, amniotic membrane, and placenta, and compare biological and transcriptome characteristics of MSCs, in order to provide a basis for the clinical application of canine MSCs. MSCs were isolated from Chinese pastoral dogs, and the following experiments were performed: (1) the third, sixth, and ninth generations of cells were counted, respectively, and a growth curve was plotted to calculate the MSC population doubling time; (2) the expression of CD34 and CD44 surface markers was studied by immunofluorescence; (3) the third generation of cells were used for osteogenetic and adipogenic differentiation experiments; and (4) MSC transcriptome profiles were performed using RNA sequencing. All of the five types of MSCs showed fibroblast-like adherent growth. The cell surface expressed CD44 instead of CD34; the third-generation MSCs had the highest proliferative activity. The average population doubling time of adipose mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs), placenta mesenchymal stem cells (P-MSCs), bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs), and amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (AM-MSCs) were 15.8 h, 21.2 h, 26.2 h, 35 h, and 41.9 h, respectively.

The pathogenesis of acne is attributed to multiple factors, including altered sebum production, inflammatory processes, dysregulation of the hormone microenvironment, and the proliferation of the skin commensal bacteria, Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes). Androgens induce the proliferation and differentiation of sebocytes, (cells that comprise the sebaceous gland), help regulate the synthesis of the lipids that are incorporated into sebum and stimulate the production of cytokines that are found in inflammatory acne lesions. Several studies have established that clascoterone is a potent antiandrogen that is well tolerated and has selective topical activity. Its potency as an acne therapeutic is currently being analyzed in a large phase 3 clinical trial. The study described herein elucidates for the first time the mechanism of action of clascoterone. Clascoterone was found to bind the androgen receptor (AR) with high affinity in vitro, inhibit AR-regulated transcription in a reporter cell line, and antagonize androgen-regulated lipid and inflammatory cytokine production in a dose-dependent manner in human primary sebocytes. In particular, when compared to another AR antagonist, spironolactone, clascoterone was significantly better at inhibiting inflammatory cytokine synthesis from sebocytes. Therefore, clascoterone may be an excellent candidate to be the first topical antiandrogen to treat acne.

Main causes of NAFLD comprise high caloric intake and a sedentary lifestyle, with high intakes of saturated FAs.The review includes several searches considering the effects of n-3 LCPUFAs in NAFLD in vivo and in vitro models, using the PubMed database from the National Library of Medicine-National Institutes of Health.The LCPUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid (C20: n-3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6 n-3, DHA) have a positive effect in diminishing liver steatosis, OS, and the levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and pro-inflammatory cytokines, with improvement of insulin sensitivity and adiponectin levels. The molecular pathways described for n-3 LCPUFAs in cellular and animal models and humans include peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α activation favouring FA oxidation, diminution of  due to sterol responsive element binding protein-1c downregulation and inflammation resolution. Besides, nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 activation is elicited by n-3 LCPUFA-derived oxidation products producing direct and indirect antioxidant responses, with concomitant anti-fibrogenic action.The discussed effects of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation support its use in NAFLD, although having a limited value in NASH, a contention that may involve n-3 LCPUFA oxygenated derivatives.
