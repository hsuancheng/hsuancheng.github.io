However, the underlying mechanisms by which RGC-32 regulates thermogenic gene expression remain to be determined. In the present study, RGC-32 expression in white adipose tissue (WAT) was suppressed during cold exposure-induced WAT . Rgc32 significantly increased thermogenic gene expression in the differentiated stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of inguinal (i)WAT and interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT). Rgc32 and cold exposure regulated a common set of genes in iWAT, as shown by RNA sequencing data. Pathway enrichment analyses showed that Rgc32 down-regulated PI3K/Akt signaling-related genes. Akt phosphorylation was also consistently decreased in Rgc32 iWAT, which led to an increase in β3-adrenergic receptor (β3-AR) expression and subsequent activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC)-1. β3-AR antagonist SR 59230A and mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin blocked Rgc32-induced thermogenic gene expression in both iWAT and interscapular BAT. These results indicate that RGC-32 suppresses adipose tissue thermogenic gene expression through down-regulation of β3-AR expression and mTORC1 activity via a PI3K/Akt-dependent mechanism.-Chen, S., Mei, X., Yin, A., Yin, H., Cui, X.-., Chen, S.-Y.

However, suprascapular nerve transection, when used in previous models, is different from chronic compression of the suprascapular nerve in patients. To define the role of suprascapular nerve chronic injury in rotator cuff muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration, we developed a novel reversible suprascapular nerve compression mouse model.We asked: (1) Can suprascapular nerve injury be induced by compression but reversed after compression release? (2) Can muscle fatty infiltration be induced by suprascapular nerve compression and reversed after compression release? (3) Is white fat  involved in fatty infiltration resorption?Mice in a common strain of C57BL/6J were randomly assigned to suprascapular nerve transection (n = 10), nerve compression (n = 10), nerve compression and release (n = 10), or sham control (n = 10) groups. To study the role or white fat  on muscle fatty infiltration, additional UCP1 reporter mice (n = 4 for nerve compression and n = 4 for nerve compression release) and knockout mice (n = 4 for nerve compression and n = 4 for nerve compression release) were used. Nerve injury was testified using osmium tetroxide staining and neural muscular junction staining and then semiquantified by counting the degenerating axons and disrupted junctions. Muscle fatty infiltration was evaluated using Oil Red O staining and then semiquantified by measuring the area fraction of fat. Immunofluorescent and Oil Red O staining on UCP1 transgenic mice was conducted to testify whether white fat  was involved in fatty infiltration resorption. Ratios of UCP1 positively stained area and fat area to muscle cross-section area were measured to semiquantify UCP1 expression and fatty infiltration in muscle by blinded reviewers. Analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc comparisons was used for statistical analysis between groups.Suprascapular nerve injury was induced by compression but reversed after release. The ratios of degenerating axons were: sham control: 6% ± 3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3%-10%); nerve compression: 58% ± 10% (95% CI, 45%-70% versus sham, p < 0.001); and nerve compression and release: 15% ± 9% (95% CI, 5%-26% versus sham, p = 0.050). The supraspinatus muscle percentage area of fatty infiltration increased after 6 weeks of nerve compression (19% ± 1%; 95% CI, 18%-20%; p < 0.001) but showed no difference after compression release for 6 weeks (5% ± 3%; 95% CI, 1%-10%; p = 0.054) compared with sham (2% ± 1%; 95% CI, 1%-3%). However, the fat area fraction in UCP1 knockout mice did not change after nerve compression release (6% ± 1%; 95% CI, 4%-8% at 2 weeks after compression and 5% ± 0.32%; 95% CI, 4%-6% after 2 weeks of release; p = 0.1095).We developed a clinically relevant, reversible suprascapular nerve compression mouse model. Fatty infiltration resorption after compression release was mediated through white fat .If the mechanism of  of white fat in rotator cuff muscle fatty infiltration can be confirmed in humans, a UCP1 agonist may be an effective treatment for patients with suprascapular nerve injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30883053>Transcatheter Aortic-Valve Replacement with a Self-Expanding Valve in Low-Risk Patients.</a></h2><p>Transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) is an alternative to surgery in patients with severe aortic stenosis who are at increased risk for death from surgery; less is known about TAVR in low-risk patients.We performed a randomized noninferiority trial in which TAVR with a self-expanding supraannular bioprosthesis was compared with surgical aortic-valve replacement in patients who had severe aortic stenosis and were at low surgical risk. When 850 patients had reached 12-month follow-up, we analyzed data regarding the primary end point, a composite of death or disabling stroke at 24 months, using Bayesian methods.Of the 1468 patients who underwent randomization, an attempted TAVR or surgical procedure was performed in 1403. The patients' mean age was 74 years. The 24-month estimated incidence of the primary end point was 5.3% in the TAVR group and 6.7% in the surgery group (difference, -1.4 percentage points; 95% Bayesian credible interval for difference, -4.9 to 2.1; posterior probability of noninferiority >0.999). At 30 days, patients who had undergone TAVR, as compared with surgery, had a lower incidence of disabling stroke (0.5% vs. 1.7%), bleeding complications (2.4% vs. 7.5%), acute kidney injury (0.9% vs. 2.8%), and atrial fibrillation (7.7% vs. 35.4%) and a higher incidence of moderate or severe aortic regurgitation (3.5% vs. 0.5%) and pacemaker implantation (17.4% vs. 6.1%). At 12 months, patients in the TAVR group had lower aortic-valve gradients than those in the surgery group (8.6 mm Hg vs. 11.2 mm Hg) and larger effective orifice areas (2.3 cm vs. 2.0 cm).In patients with severe aortic stenosis who were at low surgical risk, TAVR with a self-expanding supraannular bioprosthesis was noninferior to surgery with respect to the composite end point of death or disabling stroke at 24 months.

Previously, we found that eIF4A interacts with cyclin-dependent kinase A (CDKA), the plant ortholog of mammalian CDK1. Here, we show that this interaction occurs only in proliferating cells where the two proteins coassociate with 5'-cap-binding protein complexes, eIF4F or the plant-specific eIFiso4F. CDKA phosphorylates eIF4A on a conserved threonine residue (threonine-164) within the RNA-binding motif 1b TPGR. In vivo, a phospho-null (APGR) variant of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) eIF4A1 protein retains the ability to functionally complement a mutant (eif4a1) plant line lacking eIF4A1, whereas a phosphomimetic (EPGR) variant fails to complement. The phospho-null variant (APGR) rescues the slow growth rate of roots and rosettes, together with the ovule-abortion and late-flowering phenotypes. In vitro, wild-type recombinant eIF4A1 and its phospho-null variant both support translation in cell-free wheat germ extracts dependent upon eIF4A, but the phosphomimetic variant does not support translation and also was deficient in ATP hydrolysis and helicase activity. These observations suggest a mechanism whereby CDK phosphorylation has the potential to down-regulate eIF4A activity and thereby affect translation.© 2016 American Society of Plant Biologists.

In the  reaction, a red pigment, 2,2´-nitrilodi-2(2´)-deoxy-L-ascorbic acid ammonium salt (NDA), is generated from AA via L-scorbamic acid (SCA) as an intermediate. However, the biological activities of SCA and NDA have not yet been clarified. In this study, we assayed the antioxidant activities of SCA and NDA using ABTS radical cation and their neurite outgrowth-enhancing activities in PC12 cells. SCA showed stronger radical-scavenging activity than that of AA, while NDA hardly showed any activity. SCA and NDA enhanced the neurite outgrowth induced by dibutyryl cyclic AMP after their incorporation into cells in the same manner as that of AA. The results indicated that SCA has antioxidant activity and that SCA and NDA have neurite outgrowth-enhancing activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27251678>Effect of antibrowning dips and controlled atmosphere storage on the physico-chemical, visual and nutritional quality of minimally processed "Rojo Brillante" persimmons.</a></h2><p>The combined effect of antibrowning dips and controlled atmosphere storage on fresh-cut "Rojo Brillante" persimmon quality was investigated.

This goal has been especially encouraged by new important discoveries of human brown adipose tissues. The accumulating evidence confirms the presence of active brown adipocytes, not only in newborns, but also in adult humans. In rodents, there are two populations of the Ucp1-expressing adipocytes with well characterized-thermogenic functions, classical interscapular brown adipocytes and brite/beige adipocytes (brown adipocytes that are induced in white adipose tissues). Importantly, the anatomical localization, gene expression profiling and functional characterization of Ucp1-expressing fat cells indicates brite and brown adipocytes coexist in human beings. Therefore, the research directions of brown and brite adipogenesis provide lead to potential new therapies to fight obesity and its related metabolic diseases in human being. The objectives of this review are (1) to discuss the fate of primary adipocytes based on tissue origins, and (2) to discuss mechanisms of brown and brite adipogenesis which could lead to their different responses to  reagents.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier .V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

However, irisin physiology and regulation remain largely unknown, and existing data are mainly derived from observational studies. In this study, we aimed to elucidate whether changes in thyroid-axis hormones alter circulating irisin levels in humans, thereby exerting a direct downstream effect on serum irisin.Samples from a cross-sectional evaluation and two interventions were utilized, including patients who had previously undergone thyroidectomy. In the cross-sectional study, 96 consecutively enrolled subjects were divided into a euthyroid group and a subclinical hyperthyroid group, according to their serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels (TSH cutoff 0.3 mIU/L). In interventional study A, 34 patients who had undergone thyroidectomy due to thyroid cancer were withdrawn from their thyroxine replacement treatment for five weeks. In interventional study , 13 patients underwent a recombinant human TSH stimulation protocol, and blood samples were drawn at baseline, day 3 (i.e., at least 24 hours after the second intramuscular injection), day 5, and day 10.Irisin concentrations were not associated with thyroid-axis hormones (i.e., TSH, free thyroxine, and free triiodiothyronine) cross-sectionally in either the overall cohort or in the euthyroid and/or subclinical hyperthyroid subgroups (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference between euthyroid and subclinical hyperthyroid subjects (p = 0.60). Levothyroxine withdrawal did not result in any changes in irisin concentrations (p = 0.33). Recombinant human TSH stimulation did not induce any significant changes in circulating irisin (p = 0.60).Changes in thyroid-axis hormone levels within the physiological or supraphysiological range do not affect circulating irisin levels in humans. Therefore, their metabolic effects are most likely independent of each other. Other regulators of irisin levels should be identified in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29261404>Hypothalamic GRP78, a new target against obesity?</a></h2><p>The chaperone GRP78 (glucose related protein 78), also called BiP (binding immunoglobulin protein) is a key regulator of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.

Method Fourteen children (5-14 years old) who are hard of hearing participated in this study. Participants wore laboratory hearing aids. Open-set word recognition thresholds were measured adaptively for 2 hearing aid settings: (a) omnidirectional (OMNI) and () fully adaptive directionality. Each hearing aid setting was evaluated in 3 listening conditions. Fourteen children with normal hearing served as age-matched controls. Results Children who are hard of hearing required a more advantageous signal-to-noise ratio than children with normal hearing to achieve comparable performance in all 3 conditions. For children who are hard of hearing, the average improvement in signal-to-noise ratio when comparing fully adaptive directionality to OMNI was 4.0 dB in noise, regardless of target location. Children performed similarly with fully adaptive directionality and OMNI settings in the presence of the speech maskers. Conclusions Compared to OMNI, fully adaptive directionality improved speech recognition in steady noise for children who are hard of hearing, even when they were not facing the target source. This algorithm did not affect speech recognition when the background noise was speech. Although the use of hearing aids with fully adaptive directionality is not proposed as a substitute for remote microphone systems, it appears to offer several advantages over fixed directionality, because it does not depend on children facing the target talker and provides access to multiple talkers within the environment. Additional experiments are required to further evaluate children's performance under a variety of spatial configurations in the presence of both noise and speech maskers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29521125>The potential of a microneedle patch for reducing obesity.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28733671>Short-chain fatty acids and inulin, but not guar gum, prevent diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance through differential mechanisms in mice.</a></h2><p>The role of dietary fibre and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in obesity development is controversially discussed. Here, we investigated how various types of dietary fibre and different SCFA ratios affect metabolic syndrome-related disorders. Male mice (B6) were fed high-fat diets supplemented with dietary fibres (either cellulose, inulin or guar gum) or different Ac:Pr ratios (high acetate (HAc) or propionate (HPr)) for 30 weeks. Body-fat gain and insulin resistance were greatly reduced by inulin, but not by guar gum, and completely prevented by SCFA supplementation. Only inulin and HAc increased body temperature, possibly by the induction of beige/ markers in WAT. In addition, inulin and SCFA lowered hepatic triglycerides and improved insulin sensitivity. Both, inulin and HAc reduced hepatic fatty acid uptake, while only inulin enhanced mitochondrial capacity and only HAc suppressed lipogenesis in liver. Interestingly, HPr was accompanied by the induction of Nrg4 in BAT. Fermentable fibre supplementation increased the abundance of bifidobacteria; . animalis was particularly stimulated by inulin and . pseudolongum by guar gum. We conclude that in contrast to guar gum, inulin and SCFA prevent the onset of diet-induced weight gain and hepatic steatosis by different mechanisms on liver and adipose tissue metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29570397>The tumor secretory factor ZAG promotes white adipose tissue  and energy wasting.</a></h2><p>Cachexia is a complex tissue-wasting syndrome characterized by inflammation, hypermetabolism, increased energy expenditure, and anorexia.  of white adipose tissue (WAT) is one of the significant factors that contribute to energy wasting in cachexia. By utilizing a cell implantation model, we demonstrate here that the lipid mobilizing factor zinc-α-glycoprotein (ZAG) induces WAT  in mice. Increased circulating levels of ZAG not only induced lipolysis in adipose tissues but also caused robust  in WAT. Stimulating WAT progenitors with ZAG recombinant protein or expression of ZAG in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) strongly enhanced brown-like differentiation. At the molecular level, ZAG stimulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and early  cell factor 2 expression and promoted their recruitment to the PR/SET domain 16 (Prdm16) promoter, leading to enhanced expression of Prdm16, which determines brown cell fate. In brown adipose tissue, ZAG stimulated the expression of PPARγ and PPARγ coactivator 1α and promoted recruitment of PPARγ to the uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) promoter, leading to increased expression of Ucp1.

Lettuce was packaged under three different packaging conditions and stored at 4 °C for 10 days: anaerobic packaging (ANAER), equilibrium modified atmosphere packaging with 3% O (EMAP) and perforated packages (AIR). Results indicated a clear distinction between packaging conditions. EMAP and AIR resulted in a short shelf life (≤5.6 days) which was limited due to , leading to consumer rejection as assessed via the Weibull hazard analysis method, while no off-odors were detected. Culture- independent 16 s rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed Pseudomonas spp. as the dominating species. In contrast, under ANAER conditions, lactic acid bacteria dominated with genera of Leuconostoc spp. and Lactococcus spp. proliferating, while also oligotypes of Pseudomonas spp. were found. Spoilage under ANAER occurred after 6.6 days and it was related to strong fermentative-like off-odors that were present by the end of storage. As revealed by selective ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS), these odors were associated with several VOCs such as: ethanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2,3-butanediol, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, hexanal, acetic acid, ethyl acetate and dimethyl sulfide. Panelists rejected the iceberg lettuce due to the formation of off-odors while the overall appearance remained good throughout the study. Hence a sensor based technology incorporated in the packaging, detecting VOCs and in particular ethanol as dominant compound, could serve as a spoilage indicator for ANAER packed lettuce, which proved to have the longest shelf life.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier .V.

This couples finger flexion limiting the patient's ability to grasp objects. Therefore, we propose a new approach to attach a novel passive implant to the extensor digitorum longus tendon in order to create a differential mechanism in situ. The implant is expected to enable the fingers to adapt to an object's shape during grasping. Chickens have been used as a model in tendon research, but studies have primarily focused on the digital flexor tendon mechanism. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of the chicken model for extensor tendon research and to validate the surgical technique for a new approach to tendon transfer surgery.Twenty-nine chickens were randomly divided into three groups: implant (n = 12), sham (n = 10), and control (n = 7). Postoperative healing and complications were documented.Surgery was successful in all chickens. All animals healed appropriately by Day 16 postoperatively. Chickens in the implant group experienced significantly more intermittent toe-knuckling gait than the sham group (p = 0.001).The described surgical technique allowed for successful application of a novel implantable passive mechanism in a live chicken model. In combination with previous work, findings from the present study further validated a novel tendon-transfer surgery for high median-ulnar nerve palsy. Based on the degree of intermittent abnormal gait experienced by the implant group, refinement to the implant design is warranted in future studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827645>High-cell-density culture enhances the antimicrobial and freshness effects of Bacillus subtilis S1702 on table grapes (Vitis vinifera cv.

The BAT thermogenic function, which is essential for the defense of body temperature against exposure to low environmental temperatures, relies on the expression in the inner membrane of brown adipocyte's mitochondria of uncoupling protein-1, a protein that uncouples substrate oxidation from oxidative phosphorylation and leads to the production of heat instead of ATP. BAT thermogenesis depends on proper mitochondrial biogenesis during the differentiation of brown adipocytes. Despite the data that support a role for Endonuclease G (EndoG) in the process of mitochondrial biogenesis, its function in BAT has not been explored. Here, using an EndoG knockout mouse model, we demonstrate that EndoG is not essential for the expression of mitochondrial genes involved in substrate oxidation or for the induction of thermogenic genes in BAT in response to cold exposure. We also show that a lack of EndoG is associated with an increased expression of thermogenic genes (ie, uncoupling protein-1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α) in white adipose tissue (WAT) that correlates with the appearance of brown adipocyte-like cells interspersed among white adipocytes. Interestingly, the increased  of WAT elicited by the lack of EndoG was associated with a better glucose tolerance and reduced fat mass. Our results suggest that the induction of  in WAT by means of inhibiting EndoG activity appears as a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent obesity and ameliorate glucose intolerance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27479756>Improving the efficacy and safety of biologic drugs with tolerogenic nanoparticles.</a></h2><p>The development of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) is a common cause for the failure of biotherapeutic treatments and adverse hypersensitivity reactions. Here we demonstrate that poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles carrying rapamycin, but not free rapamycin, are capable of inducing durable immunological tolerance to co-administered proteins that is characterized by the induction of tolerogenic dendritic cells, an increase in regulatory T cells, a reduction in  cell activation and germinal centre formation, and the inhibition of antigen-specific hypersensitivity reactions. Intravenous co-administration of tolerogenic nanoparticles with pegylated uricase inhibited the formation of ADAs in mice and non-human primates and normalized serum uric acid levels in uricase-deficient mice. Similarly, the subcutaneous co-administration of nanoparticles with adalimumab resulted in the durable inhibition of ADAs, leading to normalized pharmacokinetics of the anti-TNFα antibody and protection against arthritis in TNFα transgenic mice. Adjunct therapy with tolerogenic nanoparticles represents a novel and broadly applicable approach to prevent the formation of ADAs against biologic therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28610446>Impacts of pulsed electric field and heat treatment on quality and sensory properties and microbial inactivation of pomegranate juice.</a></h2><p>Synergistic effects of pulsed electric field+mild heat on quality properties of pomegranate juice were modeled using the best-fit multiple (non-) linear regression models with inactivation kinetics parameters of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Staphylococcus aureus. No significant difference was detected between the control and the treated samples in terms of pH; °Brix; total antioxidant capacity; total monomeric anthocyanin content; total ascorbic acid concentration; and the sensory properties of flavor, taste, aftertaste, and overall acceptance ( p > 0.05).

Now, with tobacco marketing shifting toward greater incorporation of alternative products, it is critical to identify current attitudes toward the new landscape of tobacco advertisements.The purpose of this study was to understand the present landscape of tobacco marketing to which young adults are exposed, and to assess how they respond to it.During 2015-2016, we used ecological momentary assessment (EMA), in which 44 young adults (aged 18-28) carried smartphones equipped with a survey app. Seventy-seven percent were ever-users of tobacco and 29.5% were intermittent users of tobacco (someday users of cigarettes and/or those who used another tobacco product >5 times within the past year). For ten days, participants were prompted at three random times/day to complete a brief survey about their exposures and responses to tobacco-related advertising. Analyses used t-test and multilevel modeling.Intermittent users reported greater exposure than non-intermittent users to tobacco advertising. Further, both intermittent and ever-users reported more positive attitudes toward the tobacco advertising. Of the tobacco advertisements reported, 22% were for products unregulated by the FDA at the time of data collection. Conclusions/Importance: These findings indicate that young adults, and especially young adults who use tobacco, are exposed to a fair amount of tobacco advertising on a weekly basis. As the tobacco users in our sample were largely experimental and occasional users, these marketing exposures could put young adults at risk for progression toward regular use.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30340828>9-PAHSA promotes  of white fat via activating G-protein-coupled receptor 120 and inhibiting lipopolysaccharide / NF-kappa  pathway.</a></h2><p> of white adipose tissue is a novel mechanism to counteract obesity in view of its thermogenic activity. Activation of G-protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) can promote the  of white fat. 9-PAHSA, an endogenous mammalian lipid, which is acting as the ligand of GPR120 to enhance glucose uptake and exert anti-inflammatory effect. In the study, we would like to investigate the biological effects of 9-PAHSA on adipocyte . Here, we show that 9-PAHSA induces  of 3T3-L1 adipocytes via enhanced expression of brown fat specific genes. 9-PAHSA-induced  in white adipocytes of WT mice and ob/ob mice was investigated by determining expression levels of brown adipocyte-specific genes/proteins by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, immunoblot analysis and immunochemical staining. The effects of 9-PAHSA on brown fat markers in 3T3-L1 cells were decreased when GPR120 gene was silenced. To investigate the molecular mechanism of 9-PAHSA on adipocyte , lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory model was conducted. 9-PAHSA treatment abolished LPS-induced NF-kappa  (NF-κ) activation and inflammatory cytokine secretion. But these anti-inflammatory effects of 9-PAHSA were attenuated by GPR120 knockdown. Our finding demonstrated that the  of adipocyte was induced by 9-PAHSA through activating GPR120 and inhibiting the LPS/NF-κ pathway.

Therefore, we hypothesized that during dietary intervention for weight loss, auricular electric stimulation (AES), an alternative of VNS, accelerates weight loss by increasing white adipose tissue (WAT)  and increases energy expenditure.C57BL/6J male mice were fed a high-fat diet for 5 wk. to induce obesity, then switched to a low-fat diet for 5 wk. and allocated into 3 groups to receive 2 Hz electric stimulation on ears, electrode clamps only, or nothing (AES, Sham and Ctrl, respectively).Switching to a low-fat diet reduced body weight progressively in all 3 groups, with the greatest reduction in the AES group. In accordance with a mild decrease in feed intake, hypothalamus mRNA levels of Npy, AgRP tended to be reduced, while Pomc tended to be increased by AES. Mice in the AES group had the highest concentrations of norepinephrine in serum and inguinal WAT, and expression levels of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) and tyrosine hydroxylase in inguinal WAT. Furthermore, their subcutaneous adipocytes had multilocular and UCP-1 characteristics, along with a smaller cell size.AES, by increasing WAT , could be used in conjunction with a low-fat diet to augment weight loss in addition to suppressing appetite.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28833127>Effects of the Maillard Reaction on the Immunoreactivity of Amandin in Food Matrices.</a></h2><p>Amandin is the major storage protein and allergen in almond seeds. Foods, containing almonds, subjected to thermal processing typically experience Maillard  reaction. The resulting destruction of amino groups, protein glycation, and/or denaturation may alter amandin immunoreactivity. Amandin immunoreactivity of variously processed almond containing foods was therefore the focus of the current investigation. Commercial and laboratory prepared foods, including those likely to have been subjected to Maillard , were objectively assessed by determining Hunter L , a ,  values. The L values for the tested samples were in the range of 31.75 to 85.28 consistent with Maillard . Three murine monoclonal antibodies, 4C10, 4F10, and 2A3, were used to determine the immunoreactivity of the targeted samples using immunoassays (ELISA, Western blot, dot blot). The tested foods did not exhibit cross-reactivity indicating that the immunoassays were amandin specific. For sandwich ELISAs, ratio (R) of sample immunoreactivity to reference immunoreactivity was calculated. The ranges of R values were 0.67 to 15.19 (4C10), 1.00 to 11.83 (4F10), and 0.77 to 23.30 (2A3). The results of dot blot and Western blot were consistent with those of ELISAs. Results of these investigations demonstrate that amandin is a stable marker protein for almond detection regardless of the degree of amandin denaturation and/or destruction as a consequence of Maillard reaction encountered under the tested processing conditions.Foods containing almond are often subjected to processing prior to consumption. Amandin, the major allergen in almond, may experience Maillard reaction. Understanding the change in amandin immunoreactivity as a result of Maillard reaction is important for amandin detection and production of hypoallergenic food products.© 2017 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28839185>Antisense oligonucleotide and thyroid hormone conjugates for obesity treatment.</a></h2><p>Using the principle of antibody-drug conjugates that deliver highly potent cytotoxic agents to cancer cells for cancer therapy, we here report the synthesis of antisense-oligonucleotides (ASO) and thyroid hormone T3 conjugates for obesity treatment. ASOs primarily target fat and liver with poor penetrance to other organs. Pharmacological T3 treatment increases energy expenditure and causes weight loss, but is contraindicated for obesity treatment due to systemic effects on multiple organs. We hypothesize that ASO-T3 conjugates may knock down target genes and enrich T3 action in fat and liver. Two established ASOs are tested. Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT)-ASO prevents diet-induced obesity in mice. Apolipoprotein  (ApoB)-ASO is an FDA approved drug for treating familial hypercholesterolemia. NNMT-ASO and ApoB-ASO are chemically conjugated with T3 using a non-cleavable sulfo-SMCC linker. Both NNMT-ASO-T3 (NAT3) and ApoB-ASO-T3 (AAT3) enhance thyroid hormone receptor activity. Treating obese mice with NAT3 or AAT3 decreases adiposity and increases lean mass. ASO-T3 enhances white fat , decreases genes for fatty acid synthesis in liver, and shows limited effects on T3 target genes in heart and muscle. Furthermore, AAT3 augments LDL cholesterol-lowering effects of ApoB-ASO. Therefore, ASO and hormone/drug conjugation may provide a novel strategy for obesity and hyperlipidemia treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28535336>Transport of the Glucosamine-Derived  Product Fructosazine (Polyhydroxyalkylpyrazine) Across the Human Intestinal Caco-2 Cell Monolayer: Role of the Hexose Transporters.</a></h2><p>The transport mechanism of fructosazine, a glucosamine self-condensation product, was investigated using a Caco-2 cell model. Fructosazine transport was assessed by measuring the bidirectional permeability coefficient across Caco-2 cells. The mechanism of transport was evaluated using phlorizin, an inhibitor of sodium-dependent glucose cotransporters (SGLT) 1 and 2, phloretin and quercetin, inhibitors of glucose transporters (GLUT) 1 and 2, transcytosis inhibitor wortmannin, and gap junction disruptor cytochalasin D. The role of hexose transporters was further studied using downregulated or overexpressed cell lines. The apparent permeability (P) of fructosazine was 1.30 ± 0.02 × 10 cm/s. No significant (p > 0.05) effect was observed in fructosazine transport by adding wortmannin and cytochalasin D. The presence of phlorizin, phloretin, and quercetin decreased fructosazine transport. The downregulated GLUT cells line was unable to transport fructosazine. In human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells, GLUT1 or GLUT2 and SGLT are mainly responsible for fructosazine transport.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30001012>[Effects of Enhanced Ultraviolet  Irradiation on Photosynthetic and Antioxidant System of Sorghum Seedlings].</a></h2><p>The UV- radiation on the surface of our planet has been enhanced due to gradual thinning of ozone layer. The change of solar spectrum UV- radiation will cause damage to all kinds of terrestrial plants at certain degree. In this paper, taking breeding sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.Moench))variety Longza No.5 as sample, 40 μW·cm-2 UV- radiation treatment was conducted on sorghum seedlings at two-leaf and one-heart stage and different time courses; then after a 2 d recovering, photosynthetic parameters were measured with a photosynthetic apparatus; the activities of antioxidant enzymes were detected as well. Our results revealed that, as the dosages of UV- increasing, leaf  injury was aggravated, plants dwarfing and significantly were reduced fresh weight and dry weight were observed; anthocyanin content was significantly increased; chlorophyll and carotenoid content significantly were reduced and net photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were decreased. Meanwhile, with the increase in UV- dosages, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration and transpiration rate showed “down - up - down” trend; the activities of SOD and GR presented “down - up” changes; activities of POD and CAT demonstrated “down - up - down”, and APX, GPX showed an “up - down - up” pattern. It is worth to note that, under the four-dose treatment, a sharp decline in net photosynthesis in sorghum seedlings was observed at 6 h UV- treatment (equals to 2.4 J·m-2), and an obvious turning point was also found for other photosynthetic parameters and activities of antioxidant enzymes at the same time point. In summary, the results indicated that the enhanced UV- radiation directly accounted for the damages in photosynthesis system including photosynthetic pigment content, net photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of sorghum; the antioxidant system showed different responses to UV- radiation below or above 6 h treatment: ASA-GSH cycle was more sensitive to low-dose UV- radiation, while high-dose UV- radiation not only undermined the photosynthesis system, but also triggered plant enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems, resulting in leaf  and necrosis,biomass accumulation reduction, plant dwarfing and even death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29188032>Effects of quince seed, almond, and tragacanth gum coating on the banana slices properties during the process of hot air drying.</a></h2><p>Due to early deterioration of banana in drying process, almond, quince seed, and tragacanth gums as edible coatings were determined.

These could however, produce side-effects following systemic exposure. The present study explored the possibility of local use of CL-316,243 - a selective ß3 agonist - to circumvent this problem. Rats treated s.c. for 2 weeks (0.3 and 1 mg/kg) showed decreased inguinal fat pad (IFP) weight/volume, increased UCP-1 staining and expressed BAT-like features in H&E stained micrographs. Interscapular BAT increased in weight/volume. In contrast, local treatment into the IFP was not efficacious in terms of weight/volume, despite slight increases in UCP-1 staining and changes in histological features. After local treatment, the exposure of the IFP was lower than after systemic treatment. In turn higher local doses (0.5 and 5 mg/ml) were then tested which produced a strong trend for decreased volume of the IFP, a significant increase in UCP-1 staining, and also a decrease in adipocytes size but increased number. However, after this treatment the systemic exposure was in the same range as following systemic treatment. In conclusion, we saw no evidence for the possibility of converting inguinal WAT to a BAT-phenotype solely through local activation of ß3 receptors. This is in concert with our in vitro experiments which detected direct effects of PPARγ agonists at the gene/protein expression and functional level, but were unable to detect any effect of CL-316,243.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier .V.

Response surface methodology was applied to optimize the independent reaction parameters of cysteine and glucosamine in Maillard reaction. Box-Behnken factorial design was used with 30 runs of 16 factorial levels, 8 axial levels and 6 central levels. The degree of Maillard reaction was determined by reading absorption at 425 nm in a spectrophotometer and Hunter's L, a, and  values. ΔE was consequently set as the fifth response factor. In the statistical analyses, determination coefficients (R) for their absorbance, Hunter's L, a,  values, and ΔE were 0.94, 0.79, 0.73, 0.96, and 0.79, respectively, showing that the absorbance and Hunter's  value were good dependent variables for this model system. The optimum processing parameters were determined to yield glucosamine-cysteine Maillard reaction product with higher absorbance and higher colour change. The optimum estimated absorbance was achieved at the condition of initial pH 8.0, 111°C reaction temperature, 2.47 h reaction time, and 1.30 concentration ratio. The optimum condition for colour change measured by Hunter's  value was 2.41 h reaction time, 114°C reaction temperature, initial pH 8.3, and 1.26 concentration ratio.

The ABC transporters can selectively extrude a wide variety of structurally and functionally unrelated substrates, leading to multidrug resistance. Despite extensive study, their efflux molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we synthesized and characterized purified silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) (97 ± 13 nm in diameter), and used them as photostable optical imaging probes to study efflux kinetics of ABC membrane transporters (BmrA) of single live cells ). The NPs with concentrations up to 3.7 pM were stable (non-aggregated) in a PBS buffer and biocompatible with the cells. We found a high dependence of accumulation of the intracellular NPs in single live cells (WT, Ct-BmrA-EGFP, Δ) upon the cellular expression level of BmrA and NP concentration (0.93, 1.85 and 3.7 pM), showing the highest accumulation of intracellular NPs in Δ (deletion of BmrA) and the lowest ones in Ct-BmrA-EGFP (over-expression of BmrA). Interestingly, the accumulation of intracellular NPs in Δ increases nearly proportionally with the NP concentration, while those in WT and Ct-BrmA-EGFP do not. This suggests that the NPs enter the cells via passive diffusion driven by concentration gradients and are extruded out of cells by BmrA transporters, similar to conventional pump substrates (antibiotics). This study shows that such large substrates (84-100 nm NPs) can enter into the live cells and be extruded out of the cells by BmrA, and the NPs can serve as nm-sized optical imaging probes to study the size-dependent efflux kinetics of membrane transporters in single live cells in real time.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28807877>Cryptotanshinone promotes commitment to the brown adipocyte lineage and mitochondrial biogenesis in C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells via AMPK and p38-MAPK signaling.</a></h2><p>Although white adipose tissue (WAT) stores triglycerides and contributes to obesity, brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy as heat. Therefore,  of WAT is regarded as an attractive way to counteract obesity. Our previous studies have revealed that treatment with cryptotanshinone (CT) during adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells inhibits their differentiation. Here, we found that pretreatment of C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells with CT before exposure to adipogenic hormonal stimuli promotes the commitment of these mesenchymal stem cells to the adipocyte lineage as confirmed by increased triglyceride accumulation. Furthermore, CT treatment induced the expression of early -cell factor 2 (Ebf2) and bone morphogenetic protein 7 (Bmp7), which are known to drive differentiation of C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells toward preadipocytes and to the commitment to brown adipocytes. Consequently, CT treatment yielded brown-adipocyte-like features as evidenced by elevated expression of brown-fat signature genes including Ucp1, Prdm16, Pgc-1α, Cidea, Zic1, and beige-cell-specific genes such as CD137, Hspb7, Cox2, and Tmem26. Additionally, CT treatment induced mitochondrial biogenesis through upregulation of Sirt1, Tfam, Nrf1, and Cox7a and increased mitochondrial mass and DNA content. Our data also showed that cotreatment with CT and BMP4 was more effective at activating brown-adipocyte-specific genes. Mechanistic experiments revealed that treatment with CT activated AMPKα and p38-MAPK via their phosphorylation: the two major signaling pathways regulating energy metabolism. Thus, these findings suggest that CT is a candidate therapeutic agent against obesity working via activation of  and mitochondrial biogenesis in C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier .V.

Post-transplant adoptive immunotherapy using cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) of the donor origin provide graft-versus-tumor effects, with or without graft-versus-host disease. Myeloid leukemias express immunogenic leukemia associated antigens (LAAs); such as WT-1, PRAME, MAGE, h-TERT and others, most of them are able to induce specific T cell responses whenever associated with the proper co-stimulation. We investigated the ability of a LAA-expressing hybridoma cell line to induce CTL clones in PBMCs of HLA-matched healthy donors in vitro. The CTL clones were induced by repetitive co-culture with LAAs-expressing, HLA-A*0201(+) hybrid cell line, generated by fusion of leukemia blasts to human immortalized APC (EBV-sensitized -lymphoblastoid cell line; HMy2). The induced cytotoxic T cell clones were phenotypically and functionally characterized by pentamer analysis, IFN-γ release ELISPOT and cellular cytotoxicity assays.

Potato exhibits genetic and environmental variation in resistance to CIS. The current study profiles gene expression in post-harvest tubers before cold storage using transcriptome sequencing and identifies genes whose expression is predictive for CIS. A distance matrix for potato clones based on glucose levels after cold storage was constructed and compared to distance matrices constructed using RNA-seq gene expression data. Congruence between glucose and gene expression distance matrices was tested for each gene. Correlation between glucose and gene expression was also tested. Seventy-three genes were found that had significant p values in the congruence and correlation tests. Twelve genes from the list of 73 genes also had a high correlation between glucose and gene expression as measured by Nanostring nCounter. The gene annotations indicated functions in protein degradation, nematode resistance, auxin transport, and gibberellin response. These 12 genes were used to build models for prediction of CIS using multiple linear regression. Nine linear models were constructed that used different combinations of the 12 genes. An F-box protein, cellulose synthase, and a putative Lax auxin transporter gene were most frequently used. The findings of this study demonstrate the utility of gene expression profiles in predictive diagnostics for severity of CIS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31351399>Hair cortisol and depressive symptoms in youth: An investigation of curvilinear relationships.</a></h2><p>As the prevalence of depression is increasing among youth in the U.S., research on the utility of biomarkers in predicting depressive symptomatology is burgeoning. Hair cortisol may be a useful biomarker as it is a retrospective and longer-term measure of the mean cortisol level. However, studies have yet to examine the relationships between hair cortisol and depressive symptoms in samples of youth, and findings with adult samples are mixed. This study examined hair cortisol as a predictor of depressive symptoms, including the potential for nonlinear relationships.A representative community sample of 432 adolescents aged 11 to 17 years was examined. Depressive symptoms were measured using a 9-item short-form of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale. Hair was cut from the posterior vertex region of the scalp using thinning shears. Hair was washed, minced, ground and assayed with Salimetrics® Cortisol Enzyme Immunoassay Kit. Hair cortisol levels were logged for statistical analysis.In multivariable regression analysis, no significant linear relationship was found in model 1 between hair cortisol and depressive symptoms (= -0.036, se = 0.02, p = 0.13).

This could be achieved by stimulating thermogenesis through activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and/or the induction of  of white adipose tissue (WAT). Over the last years, it has become clear that several metalloproteinases play an important role in adipocyte biology. Here, we investigated the potential role of ADAMTS5.Mice deficient in ADAMTS5 () and wild-type () littermates were kept on a standard of Western-type diet for 15 weeks. Energy expenditure and heat production was followed by indirect calorimetry. To activate thermogenesis, mice were treated with the β3-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) agonist CL-316,243 or alternatively, exposed to cold for 2 weeks.Compared to  mice,  mice have significantly more interscapular BAT and marked  of their subcutaneous (SC) WAT. Thermogenic pathway analysis indicated, in the absence of ADAMTS5, enhanced β-AR signaling via activation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Additional β-AR stimulation with CL-316,243 promoted  of WAT in  mice but had no additive effect in  mice. However, cold exposure induced more pronounced  of WAT in  mice.These data indicate that ADAMTS5 plays a functional role in development of BAT and  of WAT. Hence, selective targeting of ADAMTS5 could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment/prevention of obesity and metabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30208310>Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid Signaling in Brown Adipose Tissue Promotes Systemic Metabolic Derangement in Obesity.</a></h2><p>Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a metabolically active organ that contributes to the maintenance of systemic metabolism. The sympathetic nervous system plays important roles in the homeostasis of BAT and promotes its  and activation. However, the role of other neurotransmitters in BAT homeostasis remains largely unknown. Our metabolomic analyses reveal that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels are increased in the interscapular BAT of mice with dietary obesity. We also found a significant increase in GABA-type  receptor subunit 1 (GABA-BR1) in the cell membranes of brown adipocytes of dietary obese mice. When administered to obese mice, GABA induces BAT dysfunction together with systemic metabolic disorder. Conversely, the genetic inactivation or inhibition of GABA-BR1 leads to the re- of BAT under conditions of metabolic stress and ameliorated systemic glucose intolerance. These results indicate that the constitutive activation of GABA/GABA-BR1 signaling in obesity promotes BAT dysfunction and systemic metabolic derangement.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Gelling temperatures increased as spray-drying inlet temperatures (140-180C) were increased (p < .05). ΔE*, a*-, and *- values of gel increased but L* and whiteness decreased when higher spray-drying temperatures were used (p < .05). However, whiteness and lightness of albumen gel were drastically increased after desugarization (p < .05). Texture profile analysis showed that hardness, springiness, gumminess, and chewiness of gel decreased with increasing spray-drying temperatures. Moreover, gel of freeze-dried desugarized albumen powder had higher hardness, springiness, gumminess, and chewiness than that of spray-dried nondesugarized counterpart (p < .05). Albumen gel prepared from desugarized albumen powder showed the compact network with more connectivity and smaller voids than that from nondesugarized one as visualized by scanning electron microscopy, regardless of drying conditions. Prior desugarization could lower  and increased gelling properties of duck albumen powder. Higher spray drying inlet temperature generally exhibited the adverse effect on properties of resulting albumen powder. Both desugarization and drying conditions had the profound influence on characteristics and textural property of duck egg albumen.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27710213>Two novel pyrrolooxazole pigments formed by the Maillard reaction between glucose and threonine or serine.</a></h2><p>Pyrrolothiazolate formed by the Maillard reaction between l-cysteine and d-glucose has a pyrrolothiazole skeleton as a chromophore.

It is obtained by boiling "aguamiel" that contains phytochemicals with diverse bioactivities. Saponins have been the most widely studied agave phytochemicals due to their cancer antiproliferative effect but their concentration may vary due to maturity of the agave plant and collection site. In this study, 18 CAS samples produced in different states of Mexico were analyzed using multivariate methods to determine which physicochemical or phytochemical parameters were responsible for variation. Additionally, extracts with different saponin profiles were tested to determine possible correlations with antiproliferative activity. Total soluble solids, pH, and water activity were similar to those reported for other agave sweeteners. Antioxidant capacity of samples was correlated to  index. Eleven steroidal saponins were found in CAS samples and they were the main source of variability. Magueyoside , a kammogenin tetraglycoside, was the most abundant saponin in all samples. With respect to bioactivity, multivariate analysis indicated that magueyoside  and a gentrogenin tetraglycoside were compounds strongly related with bioactivity. CAS from Hidalgo, Puebla, and Veracruz had higher concentration of magueyoside  than from the other kamogenin tetraglycoside found in the samples from other Mexican states. These results could be used as a first approach to characterize and standardize CAS to validate the potential health benefits derived from its consumption.© 2016 Institute of Food Technologists®</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27594197>Poor safety climate, long work hours, and musculoskeletal discomfort among Latino horse farm workers.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the prevalence of self-reported musculoskeletal discomfort (MSD) and work-related factors associated with elevated MSD among Latino thoroughbred farm workers.

This study investigated whether phyllodulcin could improve metabolic abnormalities in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Animals were fed a 60% HFD for 6 weeks to induce obesity, followed by 7 weeks of supplementation with phyllodulcin (20 or 40 mg/kg body weight (.w.)/day). Stevioside (40 mg/kg .w./day) was used as a positive control. Phyllodulcin supplementation reduced subcutaneous fat mass, levels of plasma lipids, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and improved the levels of leptin, adiponectin, and fasting blood glucose. In subcutaneous fat tissues, supplementation with stevioside or phyllodulcin significantly decreased mRNA expression of lipogenesis-related genes, including CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1C () compared to the high-fat group. Phyllodulcin supplementation significantly increased the expression of fat -related genes, including PR domain containing 16 (), uncoupling protein 1 (), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (), compared to the high-fat group. Hypothalamic brain-derived neurotrophic factor-tropomyosin receptor kinase  (BDNF-TrkB) signaling was upregulated by phyllodulcin supplementation.

Whereas the central neural circuits directed specifically to BAT or white adipose tissue (WAT) are well established, there is only a developing insight into the nature of neural inputs common to both fat types. Moreover, there is no clear view of the specific central and peripheral innervation of the browned component of WAT: beige fat. The objective of the present study is to examine the neural input to both BAT and WAT in the same animal and, by exposing different cohorts of rats to either thermoneutral or cold conditions, define changes in central neural organization that will ensure that beige fat is appropriately recruited and modulated after  of inguinal WAT (iWAT). At thermoneutrality, injection of the neurotropic (pseudorabies) viruses into BAT and WAT demonstrates that there are dedicated axonal projections, as well as collateral axonal branches of command neurons projecting to both types of fat. After cold exposure, central neural circuits directed to iWAT showed evidence of reorganization with a greater representation of command neurons projecting to both brown and beiged WAT in hypothalamic (paraventricular nucleus and lateral hypothalamus) and brainstem (raphe pallidus and locus coeruleus) sites. This shift was driven by a greater number of supraspinal neurons projecting to iWAT under cold conditions.

As adipose tissue is a key contributor to the inflammatory response to numerous metabolic stimuli, it is important to understand the mechanism behind the LPS-induced inflammation in white adipose tissue (WAT). Homeobox a5 (Hoxa5) is an important transcription factor, which is highly expressed in adipose tissue, and its mRNA expression is increased at cold exposure in mice. So far, the function of Hoxa5 in adipose tissue  has been poorly understood. So, the objective of this study was conducted to determine the role of Hoxa5 in adipose inflammatory response and white adipose  in mice. LPS-induced inflammatory and cold-induced  model were conducted. We compared the coordinated role of Hoxa5 in inflammation and thermogenesis of mice adipose. Transcriptional and methylation regulation was determined by luciferase assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and bisulfite conversion experiment. Hoxa5 and tenascin C (TNC) were involved in WAT inflammation and  in mice with LPS injection. Furthermore, Hoxa5 inhibited the TNC-involved activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4/nuclear factor kappa  (NF-κ) signal pathway and promoted WAT . Moreover, we found that a BMP4/Smad1 signal, closely related to , was activated by Hoxa5. Hoxa5 relieved adipocyte inflammation by decreasing TNC-mediated TLR4 transducer and activator of the NF-κ pathway. Interestingly, descended methylation level increased Hoxa5 expression in cold exposure. Our findings demonstrated that Hoxa5 alleviated inflammation and enhanced  of adipose tissue  negative control of TNC/TLR4/NF-κ inflammatory signaling and activating BMP4/Smad1 pathway. These findings indicated a novel potential means for the regulation of inflammation in adipocytes to prevent obesity and other inflammatory diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28271704>Synthesis and Functional Characterization of Caffeic Acid Glucoside Using Leuconostoc mesenteroides Dextransucrase.</a></h2><p>Caffeic acid was modified via transglucosylation using sucrose and dextransucrase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides -512FMCM.

The primary outcomes were HIV transmission at 1 week of age in the infant and maternal and infant safety.The median CD4 count was 530 cells per cubic millimeter among 3490 primarily black African HIV-infected women enrolled at a median of 26 weeks of gestation (interquartile range, 21 to 30). The rate of transmission was significantly lower with ART than with zidovudine alone (0.5% in the combined ART groups vs. 1.8%; difference, -1.3 percentage points; repeated confidence interval, -2.1 to -0.4). However, the rate of maternal grade 2 to 4 adverse events was significantly higher with zidovudine-based ART than with zidovudine alone (21.1% vs. 17.3%, P=0.008), and the rate of grade 2 to 4 abnormal blood chemical values was higher with tenofovir-based ART than with zidovudine alone (2.9% vs. 0.8%, P=0.03). Adverse events did not differ significantly between the ART groups (P>0.99). A birth weight of less than 2500 g was more frequent with zidovudine-based ART than with zidovudine alone (23.0% vs. 12.0%, P<0.001) and was more frequent with tenofovir-based ART than with zidovudine alone (16.9% vs. 8.9%, P=0.004); preterm delivery before 37 weeks was more frequent with zidovudine-based ART than with zidovudine alone (20.5% vs. 13.1%, P<0.001).

The ways in which stratospheric ozone depletion is directly altering climate in the southern hemisphere and the consequent extensive effects on aquatic ecosystems are also addressed. The primary objective is to synthesise novel findings over the past four years in the context of the existing understanding of ecosystem response to UV radiation and the interactive effects of climate change. If it were not for the Montreal Protocol, stratospheric ozone depletion would have led to high levels of exposure to solar UV radiation with much stronger negative effects on all trophic levels in aquatic ecosystems than currently experienced in both inland and oceanic waters. This "world avoided" scenario that has curtailed ozone depletion, means that climate change and other environmental variables will play the primary role in regulating the exposure of aquatic organisms to solar UV radiation. Reductions in the thickness and duration of snow and ice cover are increasing the levels of exposure of aquatic organisms to UV radiation. Climate change was also expected to increase exposure by causing shallow mixed layers, but new data show deepening in some regions and shoaling in others. In contrast, climate-change related increases in heavy precipitation and melting of glaciers and permafrost are increasing the concentration and colour of UV-absorbing dissolved organic matter (DOM) and particulates. This is leading to the "" of many inland and coastal waters, with consequent loss of the valuable ecosystem service in which solar UV radiation disinfects surface waters of parasites and pathogens. Many organisms can reduce damage due to exposure to UV radiation through behavioural avoidance, photoprotection, and photoenzymatic repair, but meta-analyses continue to confirm negative effects of UV radiation across all trophic levels. Modeling studies estimating photoinhibition of primary production in parts of the Pacific Ocean have demonstrated that the UV radiation component of sunlight leads to a 20% decrease in estimates of primary productivity. Exposure to UV radiation can also lead to positive effects on some organisms by damaging less UV-tolerant predators, competitors, and pathogens. UV radiation also contributes to the formation of microplastic pollutants and interacts with artificial sunscreens and other pollutants with adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems. Exposure to UV- radiation can decrease the toxicity of some pollutants such as methyl mercury (due to its role in demethylation) but increase the toxicity of other pollutants such as some pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Feeding on microplastics by zooplankton can lead to bioaccumulation in fish. Microplastics are found in up to 20% of fish marketed for human consumption, potentially threatening food security. Depletion of stratospheric ozone has altered climate in the southern hemisphere in ways that have increased oceanic productivity and consequently the growth, survival and reproduction of many sea birds and mammals. In contrast, warmer sea surface temperatures related to these climate shifts are also correlated with declines in both kelp beds in Tasmania and corals in Brazil. This assessment demonstrates that knowledge of the interactive effects of ozone depletion, UV radiation, and climate change factors on aquatic ecosystems has advanced considerably over the past four years and confirms the importance of considering synergies between environmental factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28346354>Anti-Inflammatory Properties of Irisin, Mediator of Physical Activity, Are Connected with TLR4/MyD88 Signaling Pathway Activation.</a></h2><p>Irisin, an adipomiokine known as a mediator of physical activity, induces the  of adipose tissue and it has potentially protective properties in the development of obesity-related states, such as insulin resistance, arteriosclerosis, and type 2 diabetes. Despite numerous studies conducted on this factor, still little is known about its impact on the functioning of immunocompetent cells, but its potential anti-inflammatory properties were previously suggested. In the current study we investigated the role of irisin (0-100 nM) in the downstream pathway activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in RAW 264.7 macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 ng/mL). The results have shown that irisin in high concentrations (50, 100 nM) significantly decreased the TLR4 and MyD88 protein levels, as well as the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κ (NF-κ), consequently leading to the reduction in the release of crucial pro-inflammatory cytokines. The above was confirmed for interleukin 1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin 6 (IL-6), keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), as well as for high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). Moreover, our results indicate that this effect is connected with irisin's impact on the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), where a significant reduction in p-JNK and p-ERK but not p-p38 was observed. In conclusion, these data suggest that irisin has potentially anti-inflammatory properties connected with the downregulation of downstream pathways of TLR4/MyD88.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30018623>GhSNAP33, a t-SNARE Protein From , Mediates Resistance to  Infection and Tolerance to Drought Stress.</a></h2><p>Soluble -ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins mediate membrane fusion and deliver cargo to specific cellular locations through vesicle trafficking.

The blender apple juice showed a darker brown color and 4.5 times higher PPO activity than LSM apple juice. This result suggested that the blender caused severer damage to plastids in cells leading to leakage of PPO into the juice than the LSM juicer. The total polyphenol and flavonoid content of LSM apple juice was approximately 2 times higher than that of blender apple juice because polyphenols and flavonoids can be used as substrates by PPO. The antioxidant activity of LSM juice was higher than that of blender juice. Together, these results suggested that the LSM juicer is superior to the blender for preparation of fresh apple juices due to the minimization of enzymatic oxidation reactions.

We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the high-density wheat 90 K and 660 K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assays to better understand the genetic basis of black point resistance and identify associated molecular markers.Black point reactions were evaluated in 166 elite wheat cultivars in five environments. Twenty-five unique loci were identified on chromosomes 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B (2), 3D, 4B (2), 5A (3), 5B (3), 6A, 6B, 6D, 7A (5), 7B and 7D (2), respectively, explaining phenotypic variation ranging from 7.9 to 18.0%. The highest number of loci was detected in the A genome (11), followed by the  (10) and D (4) genomes. Among these, 13 were identified in two or more environments. Seven loci coincided with known genes or quantitative trait locus (QTL), whereas the other 18 were potentially novel loci. Linear regression showed a clear dependence of black point scores on the number of favorable alleles, suggesting that QTL pyramiding will be an effective approach to increase resistance. In silico analysis of sequences of resistance-associated SNPs identified 6 genes possibly involved in oxidase, signal transduction and stress resistance as candidate genes involved in black point reaction.SNP markers significantly associated with black point resistance and accessions with a larger number of resistance alleles can be used to further enhance black point resistance in breeding.

Its activation leads to increased energy expenditure and reduced adiposity, thus contributing to a better energy homeostasis. Green tea extracts (GTEs) were shown to attenuate obesity and low-grade inflammation and to induce the lipolytic pathway in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of mice fed a high-fat diet. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the antiobesity effect of an extract from green tea leaves was associated with the activation of  in the WAT and/or the inhibition of whitening in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) in HF-diet induced obese mice. Mice were fed a control diet or an HF diet supplemented with or without 0.5% polyphenolic GTE for 8 weeks. GTE supplementation significantly reduced HF-induced adiposity (WAT and BAT) and HF-induced inflammation in WAT. Histological analysis revealed that GTE reduced the adipocyte size in the WAT and the lipid droplet size in the BAT. Markers of  were induced in the WAT upon GTE treatment, whereas markers of HF-induced whitening were reduced in the BAT. These results suggest that  activation in the WAT and whitening reduction in the BAT by the GTE could participate to the improvement of metabolic and inflammatory disorders mediated by GTE upon HF diet. Our study emphasizes the importance of using GTE as a nutritional tool to activate  and to decrease fat storage in all adipose tissues, which attenuate obesity.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In previous reports, AIs from thermophilic bacterial strains had been wildly researched, but the  reaction and by-products formed at high temperatures restricted their applications. By contrast, AIs from mesophilic Bacillus strains have some different features including lower optimal temperatures and lower requirements of metallic cofactors. These characters will be beneficial to the development of a more energy-efficient and safer production process. However, the relevant data about the kinetics and reaction properties of Bacillus AIs in D-tagatose production are still insufficient. Thus, in order to support further applications of these AIs, a comprehensive characterization of a Bacillus AI is needed.The coding gene (1422 bp) of Bacillus coagulans NL01 AI (BCAI) was cloned and overexpressed in the Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain. The enzymatic property test showed that the optimal temperature and pH of BCAI were 60 °C and 7.5 respectively. The raw purified BCAI originally showed high activity in absence of outsourcing metallic ions and its thermostability did not change in a low concentration (0.5 mM) of Mn(2+) at temperatures from 70 °C to 90 °C. Besides these, the catalytic efficiencies (k cat/K m) for L-arabinose and D-galactose were 8.7 mM(-1) min(-1) and 1.0 mM(-1) min(-1) respectively. Under optimal conditions, the recombinant E. coli cell containing BCAI could convert 150 g L(-1) and 250 g L(-1) D-galactose to D-tagatose with attractive conversion rates of 32 % (32 h) and 27 % (48 h).In this study, a novel AI from . coagulans NL01was cloned, purified and characterized. Compared with other reported AIs, this AI could retain high proportions of activity at a broader range of temperatures and was less dependent on metallic cofactors such as Mn(2+). Its substrate specificity was understood deeply by carrying out molecular modelling and docking studies. When the recombinant E. coli expressing the AI was used as a biocatalyst, D-tagatose could be produced efficiently in a simple one-pot biotransformation system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26853736>Occupational physical activity assessment for chronic disease prevention and management: A review of methods for both occupational health practitioners and researchers.</a></h2><p>Occupational physical activity (OPA) is an occupational exposure that impacts worker health. OPA is amenable to measurement and modification through the hierarchy of controls. Occupational exposure scientists have roles in addressing inadequate physical activity, as well as excessive or harmful physical activity. Occupational health researchers can contribute to the development of novel OPA exposure assessment techniques and to epidemiologic studies examining the health impacts of physical activity at work. Occupational health practitioners stand to benefit from understanding the strengths and limitations of physical activity measurement approaches, such as accelerometers in smartphones, which are already ubiquitous in many workplaces and in some worksite health programs. This comprehensive review of the literature provides an overview of physical activity monitoring for occupational exposure scientists. This article summarizes data on the public health implications of physical activity at work, highlighting complex relationships with common chronic diseases. This article includes descriptions of several techniques that have been used to measure physical activity at work and elsewhere, focusing in detail on pedometers, accelerometers, and Global Positioning System technology. Additional subjective and objective measurement strategies are described as well.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30195004>Preparation and stability of nano-scaled gel beads of λ-carrageenan bound with ferric ions.</a></h2><p>Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) is a major global public health problem, and the iron fortifiers in diet are clearly needed in the prevention and improvement of IDA for humans. A novel nano-scaled gel beads of λ-carrageenan (λ-car) specifically binding with ferric ions was developed to be a promising iron fortifier with no adverse organoleptic changes on food. Turbidity measurement, thermogravimetric analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the successful chelating. The gel beads of λ-car-Fe complex showed good dispersibility and solvent stability. The in vitro cell viability of HepG2 cells treated with λ-car-Fe was over 75% at 5 mg/mL of ferric ions, indicating a significant cytotoxicity reduction of ferric ions. The stability of λ-car-Fe complex powder was obviously increased against  during 60 d storage with zein coating, which was attributed to the prevention of moisture permeation. Zein coated gel beads also performed a slow release of ferric ions in simulated gastrointestinal juices, resulting from the compact and hydrophobic zein surface delaying the dissociation of λ-car-Fe in acidic environment. This λ-car-Fe complex would have a great potential as a safe iron fortifier and facilitate iron supplementary with the advantage to relieve the side effects of iron ions.Copyright © 2018.

LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages show reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 expression and lowered pro-inflammatory cytokine production when treated with CAE and pure phenolics. Inflammatory crosstalk created by stimulating adipocytes with macrophage-conditioned media (CM) is arrested; CAE diminishes tumor necrosis factor-α (67%) and promotes adiponectin secretion (12.3-fold). Mitochondrial function, measured by reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial content, and activity, is preserved in CM-treated adipocytes through up-regulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-α expression. Increases in insulin receptor (9-fold), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (3-fold), protein kinase  (4-fold) phosphorylation, and a decrease in insulin receptor substrate 1 serine phosphorylation induce increased glucose uptake (34%) and glucose transporter 4 translocation (14-fold) in CM-induced adipocytes.CAE phenolics promote a beige phenotype in adipocytes. Macrophages-adipocytes inflammatory interaction is reduced preventing mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance. For the first time, CAE shows a positive effect on adipogenesis and inflammation-related disorders.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

One isoform, PDE4, is overactive in chronic relapsing inflammatory skin diseases: psoriasis and eczema/atopic dermatitis, and in several cancers. East Indian sandalwood oil (EISO) has significant anti-inflammatory properties. Here, we report that 75% of pediatric eczema/atopic dermatitis patients treated with topical EISO formulations achieved a >50% reduction in their Eczema Area and Severity Index score. EISO treatment of a psoriasis model reduced PDE4 expression and reversed histopathology. EISO directly inhibited PDE enzymatic activity . In lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human dermal fibroblast, BEAS-2B, A549, and THP-1 cells, EISO suppressed total cellular PDE activity, PDE4, and 7 transcript levels, nuclear factor kappa  (NF-κ) activation, and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokine production. These results suggest that EISO anti-inflammatory activity is mediated through suppressing PDE activity, thus facilitating cAMP-regulated inhibition of NF-κ and indicate EISO as an attractive natural therapeutic for chronic and acute inflammatory disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29017399>Recombinant expression, purification, and characterization of polyphenol oxidase 2 (VvPPO2) from "Shine Muscat" (Vitis labruscana Bailey × Vitis vinifera L.).</a></h2><p>Polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) catalyze  reactions in various plant organs, therefore controlling the reactions is important for the food industry.

Liver kinase B1 (Lkb1) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) play crucial roles in regulating energy metabolism and cell growth in adipose tissue. Our recent study generated an adipocyte-specific Lkb1 and mTOR double knockout (DKO) mouse model and found that DKO of Lkb1 and mTOR caused reduction of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) mass but increase of liver mass. Moreover, the DKO mice developed fatty liver and insulin resistance but displayed improved glucose tolerance and were resistant to high-fat diet (HFD) -induced obesity. In this commentary, we compare the similarities and differences of the phenotypes found in the DKO mice and Lkb1 or mTOR or mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) or mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) single knockout mice.

Dimethyl Fumarate (DMF) is an FDA approved anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory agent with a favorable safety record. The goal of this study was to assess the effectiveness of DMF as a therapy for PAH using patient-derived cells and murine models. We show that DMF treatment is effective in reversing hemodynamic changes, reducing inflammation, oxidative damage, and fibrosis in the experimental models of PAH and lung fibrosis. Our findings indicate that effects of DMF are facilitated by inhibiting pro-inflammatory NFκ, STAT3 and cJUN signaling, as well as βTRCP-dependent degradation of the pro-fibrogenic mediators Sp1, TAZ and β-catenin.

In this study, the effects of subcritical water temperatures (100-180 °C) and times (0-10 min) on color changes (*, *, and *) and astaxanthin degradation in Pacific krill were investigated. In addition, an aqueous solution of pure astaxanthin and that of crude astaxanthin from Pacific krill, both at a concentration of 5 mg/L, were subjected to treatment under subcritical water conditions using a flow-type reactor to compare the degradation of free astaxanthin and astaxanthin fatty acid esters. To compare the results of the different treatment conditions on the properties of astaxanthin, the severity factor (log ) was calculated, which ranged from 0.38 to 3.52. The extractability of astaxanthin enhanced when the subcritical water treatment was carried out at log  values of 2.00-2.44. In contrast, astaxanthin underwent 50% degradation at log  > 2.44. The changes in the * values correlated well with the astaxanthin content in the treated krill, while the * and * values might relate to the  components forming owing to Maillard reaction.

Here, we combined intravital real-time imaging with single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and mouse models to uncover anti-PD-1 pharmacodynamics directly within tumors. We showed that effective antitumor responses required a subset of tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells (DCs), which produced interleukin 12 (IL-12). These DCs did not bind anti-PD-1 but produced IL-12 upon sensing interferon γ (IFN-γ) that was released from neighboring T cells. In turn, DC-derived IL-12 stimulated antitumor T cell immunity. These findings suggest that full-fledged activation of antitumor T cells by anti-PD-1 is not direct, but rather involves T cell:DC crosstalk and is licensed by IFN-γ and IL-12. Furthermore, we found that activating the non-canonical NF-κ transcription factor pathway amplified IL-12-producing DCs and sensitized tumors to anti-PD-1 treatment, suggesting a therapeutic strategy to improve responses to checkpoint blockade.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Effects on microbial growth, enzyme activity, antioxidant capacity and physical stability.</a></h2><p>Non-thermal pasteurization by high-pressure processing (HPP) is increasingly replacing thermal processing (TP) to maintain the properties of fresh fruit products. However, most of the research on HPP-fruit products only partially addresses fruit-pressure interaction, which limits its practical interest. The objective of this study was to assess the use of a mild HPP treatment to stabilize red fruit-based smoothies (microbial, enzymatic, oxidative and physical stability).HPP (350 MPa/10 °C/5 min) was slightly less effective than TP (85 °C/7 min) in inactivating microbes (mesophilic and psychrophilic bacteria, coliforms, yeasts and moulds) in smoothies kept at 4 °C for up to 28 days. The main limitation of using HPP was its low efficacy in inactivating oxidative (polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase) and hydrolytic (pectin methyl esterase) enzymes. Data on antioxidant status, colour parameters,  index, transmittance, turbidity and viscosity confirmed that the HPP-smoothies have a greater tendency towards oxidation and clarification, which might lead to undesirable sensory and nutritional changes (see Part ).The microbial quality of smoothies was adequately controlled by mild HPP treatment without affecting their physical-chemical characteristics; however, oxidative and hydrolytic enzymes are highly pressure-resistant, which suggests that additional strategies should be used to stabilize smoothies. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30955672>Nutritional, phytochemical, functional and sensorial attributes of Syzygium cumini L. pulp incorporated pasta.</a></h2><p>Nutritional, phytochemical and antioxidant potential of wheat pasta was enhanced by incorporation of S. cumini pulp (0, 10, 20, 30 and 40%).

Physical exercise stimulates the secretion of myokines, such as -aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA), which in turn promotes adaptive thermogenesis. White adipocyte conversion to brown cells involves dynamic changes in lipid droplet (LD) dimension and in the transcription of brown-specific marker genes.

Results suggested that the highest concentration of BAIBA after 4 days of differentiation produced the most significant effects. The number of LDs per cell increased in comparison to control cells, whereas the surface area significantly decreased. Brown adipocyte markers were up-regulated, but the effect of treatment was lost at 10 days of differentiation.

Freezing by forced air was more effective in retaining phenolics during the first 4 months of storage, although the freezing method did not affect the anthocyanin levels. Processing and storage reduced the levels of individual phenolics. Freezing by forced air was more effective than static air in retaining antioxidant activity of the pulp. Polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase enzyme levels were relatively stable and independent of pasteurisation, freezing and storage time. Even after 6 months of frozen storage, strawberry pulp is a significant source of nutrients and bioactive compounds and retains high antioxidant capacity independent of pasteurisation and freezing method.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29088696>Nutrient co-limitation at the boundary of an oceanic gyre.</a></h2><p>Nutrient limitation of oceanic primary production exerts a fundamental control on marine food webs and the flux of carbon into the deep ocean. The extensive boundaries of the oligotrophic sub-tropical gyres collectively define the most extreme transition in ocean productivity, but little is known about nutrient limitation in these zones. Here we present the results of full-factorial nutrient amendment experiments conducted at the eastern boundary of the South Atlantic gyre. We find extensive regions in which the addition of nitrogen or iron individually resulted in no significant phytoplankton growth over 48 hours. However, the addition of both nitrogen and iron increased concentrations of chlorophyll a by up to approximately 40-fold, led to diatom proliferation, and reduced community diversity. Once nitrogen-iron co-limitation had been alleviated, the addition of cobalt or cobalt-containing vitamin  could further enhance chlorophyll a yields by up to threefold. Our results suggest that nitrogen-iron co-limitation is pervasive in the ocean, with other micronutrients also approaching co-deficiency. Such multi-nutrient limitations potentially increase phytoplankton community diversity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27431366>Nutrient Regulation: Conjugated Linoleic Acid's Inflammatory and  Properties in Adipose Tissue.</a></h2><p>Obesity is the most widespread nutritional disease in the United States. Developing effective and safe strategies to manage excess body weight is therefore of paramount importance. One potential strategy to reduce obesity is to consume conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) supplements containing isomers cis-9, trans-11 and trans-10, cis-12, or trans-10, cis-12 alone. Proposed antiobesity mechanisms of CLA include regulation of (a) adipogenesis, () lipid metabolism, (c) inflammation, (d) adipocyte apoptosis, (e)  or beiging of adipose tissue, and (f) energy metabolism. However, causality of CLA-mediated responses to body fat loss, particularly the linkage between inflammation, thermogenesis, and energy metabolism, is unclear. This review examines whether CLA's antiobesity properties are due to inflammatory signaling and considers CLA's linkage with lipogenesis, lipolysis, thermogenesis, and  of white and brown adipose tissue. We propose a series of questions and studies to interrogate the role of the sympathetic nervous system in mediating CLA's antiobesity properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31117920>Sphenopalatine Ganglion Stimulation to Augment Cerebral Blood Flow.</a></h2><p>Background and Purpose- Many patients with acute ischemic stroke are not eligible for thrombolysis or mechanical reperfusion therapies due to contraindications, inaccessible vascular occlusions, late presentation, or large infarct core. Sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) stimulation to enhance collateral flow and stabilize the blood-brain barrier offers an alternative, potentially more widely deliverable, therapy. Methods- In a randomized, sham-controlled, double-masked trial at 41 centers in 7 countries, patients with anterior circulation ischemic stroke not treated with reperfusion therapies within 24 hours of onset were randomly allocated to active SPG stimulation or sham control. The primary efficacy outcome was improvement beyond expectations on the modified Rankin Scale of global disability at 90 days (sliding dichotomy), assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population. The initial planned sample size was 660 patients, but the trial was stopped early when technical improvements in device placement occurred, so that analysis of accumulated experience could be conducted to inform a successor trial. Results- Among 303 enrolled patients, 253 received at least one active SPG or sham stimulation, constituting the modified intention-to-treat population (153 SPG stimulation and 100 sham control). Age was median 73 years (interquartile range, 64-79), 52.6% were female, deficit severity on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was median 11 (interquartile range, 9-15), and time from last known well median 18.6 hours (interquartile range, 14.5-22.5). For the primary outcome, improved 3-month disability beyond expectations, rates in the SPG versus sham treatment groups were 49.7% versus 40.0%; odds ratio, 1.48 (95% CI, 0.89-2.47); P=0.13. A significant treatment interaction with stroke location (cortical versus noncortical) was noted, P=0.04. In the 87 patients with confirmed cortical involvement, rates of improvement beyond expectations were 50.0% versus 27.0%; odds ratio, 2.70 (95% CI, 1.08-6.73); P=0.03. Similar response patterns were observed for all prespecified secondary efficacy outcomes. No differences in mortality or serious adverse event safety end points were observed. Conclusions- SPG stimulation within 24 hours of onset is safe in acute ischemic stroke. SPG stimulation was not shown to statistically significantly improve 3-month disability above expectations, though favorable outcomes were nominally higher with SPG stimulation. Beneficial effects may distinctively be conferred in patients with confirmed cortical involvement. The results of this study need to be confirmed in a larger pivotal study.

High performance liquid chromatography was employed for detecting lycopene and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). The changes of lycopene and HMF during storage were regressed with kinetic equation of both zero-order and first-order models, and the latter fitted better. The kinetic equation constant ( value) of lycopene or HMF at 37°C was higher than that at 25°C. The  value of lycopene of PET/PE (P1) packaged THPS was 1.60 times of that of PET/Al/EAA/PE (P2) packaged at 37°C, while it was 2.12 times at 25°C. The  value of HMF of P1 packaged THPS was 1.69 times of that of P2 packaged at 37°C, while it was 1.01 times at 25°C. Significant correlations between color index of , , and / and lycopene or HMF were found at storage temperature.  color was attributed to both Maillard reaction and degradation of lycopene. In conclusion, lower storage temperature and stronger oxygen barrier property of package could maintain color stability and extend shelf life.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30405587>Viability of  on Fresh-Cut Chitosan and Alginate-Coated Apple and Melon Pieces.</a></h2><p>There is an increasing trend toward foods with probiotics; the awareness of healthy diet and wellbeing is the leading cause of this increase. As a result, food producers and stakeholders require new probiotic products. The increased incidence of lactose intolerance and the new lifestyles (vegan and vegetarian styles) have led to a renewed interest in non-dairy probiotic carriers. The use of biopolymeric matrices to develop active food packaging carrying probiotics has been studied and proposed as an alternative method to design new solutions. The main topic of this paper was the design of fresh-cut fruits (apples and melons) as carriers for a promising ; fruit pieces were coated with either alginate or chitosan. Apple (Granny Smith) and melon pieces (, var. ) were preliminary treated with an anti- solution (citric and ascorbic acids). Then, fruit pieces were dipped in a solution containing  c19 (9 log cfu/ml) and coated with alginate or chitosan. Samples without probiotic and/or coatings were used as controls. All samples were stored at 4°C for 14 days under air or modified atmosphere (65% N, 30% CO, and 5% O); the following analyses were done: pH, color, O and CO in the head space, microbiology (mesophilic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, and molds). The most important results can be summarized as follows: (a) Alginate coating showed better performances than chitosan-coating, as it did not affect the viability of . () The inoculation of probiotics in the controls negatively affected the color, but the coating was able to counteract this effect. This paper supports the combination of edible coatings and probiotic as a promising way to design new fruit-based functional foods; further investigations are required to study the effect of this combination on the sensory scores.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30430702>Bottom-up and top-down effects of  and warming on shallow lake food webs.</a></h2><p>Productivity and trophic structure of aquatic ecosystems result from a complex interplay of bottom-up and top-down forces that operate across benthic and pelagic food web compartments. Projected global changes urge the question how this interplay will be affected by  (increasing input of terrestrial dissolved organic matter), nutrient enrichment and warming. We explored this with a process-based model of a shallow lake food web consisting of benthic and pelagic components (abiotic resources, primary producers, grazers, carnivores), and compared model expectations with the results of a  and warming experiment in nutrient-poor ponds harboring a boreal lake community. Under low nutrient conditions, the model makes three major predictions. (a)  reduces light and increases nutrient supply; this decreases benthic and increases pelagic production, gradually shifting productivity from the benthic to the pelagic habitat. () Because of active habitat choice, fish exert top-down control on grazers and benefit primary producers primarily in the more productive of the two habitats. (c) Warming relaxes top-down control of grazers by fish and decreases primary producer biomass, but effects of warming are generally small compared to effects of  and nutrient supply. Experimental results were consistent with most model predictions for : light penetration, benthic algal production, and zoobenthos biomass decreased, and pelagic nutrients and pelagic algal production increased with . Also consistent with expectations, warming had negative effects on benthic and pelagic algal biomass and weak effects on algal production and zoobenthos and zooplankton biomass. Inconsistent with expectations,  had no effect on zooplankton and warming effects on fish depended on . The model is applicable also to nutrient-rich systems, and we propose that it is a useful tool for the exploration of the consequences of different climate change scenarios for productivity and food web dynamics in shallow lakes, the worldwide most common lake type.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26579142>The development of quick, robust, quantitative phenotypic assays for describing the host-nonhost landscape to stripe rust.</a></h2><p>Nonhost resistance is often conceptualized as a qualitative separation from host resistance. Classification into these two states is generally facile, as they fail to fully describe the range of states that exist in the transition from host to nonhost. This poses a problem when studying pathosystems that cannot be classified as either host or nonhost due to their intermediate status relative to these two extremes. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of the Poaceae-stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis Westend.) interaction for describing the host-nonhost landscape. First, using barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and Brachypodium distachyon (L.) P. Beauv. We observed that macroscopic symptoms of chlorosis and leaf  were associated with hyphal colonization by P. striiformis f. sp. tritici, respectively. This prompted us to adapt a protocol for visualizing fungal structures into a phenotypic assay that estimates the percent of leaf colonized. Use of this assay in intermediate host and intermediate nonhost systems found the frequency of infection decreases with evolutionary divergence from the host species. Similarly, we observed that the pathogen's ability to complete its life cycle decreased faster than its ability to colonize leaf tissue, with no incidence of pustules observed in the intermediate nonhost system and significantly reduced pustule formation in the intermediate host system as compared to the host system, barley-P. striiformis f. sp. hordei. By leveraging the stripe rust pathosystem in conjunction with macroscopic and microscopic phenotypic assays, we now hope to dissect the genetic architecture of intermediate host and intermediate nonhost resistance using structured populations in barley and . distachyon.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29604186>Clinical Efficacy and Safety of Baminercept, a Lymphotoxin β Receptor Fusion Protein, in Primary Sjögren's Syndrome: Results From a Phase II Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of baminercept, a lymphotoxin β receptor IgG fusion protein (LTβR-Ig), for the treatment of primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS), and to explore the possible mechanisms of action of this treatment.In this multicenter trial, 52 patients with primary SS were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous injections of 100 mg of baminercept every week for 24 weeks or matching placebo. The primary end point was the change between screening and week 24 in the stimulated whole salivary flow (SWSF) rate. Secondary end points included the European League Against Rheumatism Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI), as well as measurements of select chemokines and cytokines and enumeration of peripheral blood  and T cell subsets.The change from baseline to week 24 in the SWSF rate was not significantly different between the baminercept and placebo treatment groups (baseline-adjusted mean change -0.01 versus 0.07 ml/minute; P = 0.332). The change in the ESSDAI during treatment was also not significantly different between the treatment groups (baseline-adjusted mean change -1.23 versus -0.15; P = 0.104). Although the incidence of adverse events was similar between the treatment groups, baminercept therapy was associated with a higher incidence of liver toxicity, including 2 serious adverse events. Baminercept also produced a significant decrease in plasma levels of CXCL13 and significant changes in the number of circulating  and T cells, consistent with its known inhibitory effects on LTβR signaling.In this trial, treatment with baminercept failed to significantly improve glandular and extraglandular disease in patients with primary SS, despite evidence from mechanistic studies showing that it blocks LTβR signaling.ClinicalTrials.gov .© 2018, American College of Rheumatology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30333643>The effect of pre-treatment methods on the quality of dehydrated candied Japanese quince fruits during storage.</a></h2><p>Candied quince is one of the most popular processing products of Japanese quince () in Latvia. During the storage of dehydrated fruit, the colour turns darker, thus negatively influence the overall quality and consumers' acceptability of the product. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of different anti- agents in combination with fruit blanching and soaking as a type of pre-treatment to preserve the colour of candied quince during 8-months storage. The fruit were harvested at various maturity stage (i.e. unripe, semi ripe and ripe) with the following pre-treatment using three anti- agents (l-cysteine, NATRApHASEABAF and Natureseal AS1). Hunter L (whiteness/darkness), a (redness/greenness) and  (yellowness/blueness) values were used to measure change in colour. These values were also used for calculation of the total colour change (Δ*). Considering blanching and soaking as a type of treatment. Best results were obtained with blanching treatment. L* values decreased significantly after dehydration, showing that the samples became darker, during the further 8-months storage, L* values increased, positively influencing the colour of the tested fruit.

This accounted for 4% of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) cases (n = 390) in the cohort. Amino acid substitutions predicted to be pathogenic were assessed by means of analysis of structural protein data. Immunophenotyping, immunoblotting, and ex vivo stimulation of lymphocytes determined the functional effects of these variants. Detailed clinical and pedigree information was collected for genotype-phenotype cosegregation analyses.Both sporadic and familial cases demonstrated evidence of the noninfective complications of CVID, including massive lymphadenopathy (24%), unexplained splenomegaly (48%), and autoimmune disease (48%), features prior studies correlated with worse clinical prognosis. Although partial penetrance of clinical symptoms was noted in certain pedigrees, all carriers have a deficiency in -lymphocyte differentiation. Detailed assessment of -lymphocyte numbers, phenotype, and function identifies the presence of an increased CD21 -cell population. Combined with identification of the disease-causing variant, this distinguishes between healthy subjects, asymptomatic carriers, and clinically affected cases.We show that heterozygous loss-of-function variants in NFKB1 are the most common known monogenic cause of CVID, which results in a temporally progressive defect in the formation of immunoglobulin-producing  cells.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Previous research has not examined actual and potential exposures that adolescents have on a daily basis.The objective of this study was to determine whether both self-reported and geographically estimated tobacco retailer exposures differ by participant or neighborhood characteristics among urban and rural adolescents.The data for this study were part of a cohort study of 1220 adolescent males residing in urban and rural (Appalachian) regions in Ohio. The baseline survey asked participants how often they visited stores that typically sell tobacco in the past week (self-reported exposures). The number of tobacco retailers between home and school was determined using ArcGIS software (potential exposures). Adjusted regression models were fit to determine the characteristics that were associated with self-reported or potential exposures to retailers.Adolescents who were non-Hispanic black or other racial/ethnic minority, had used tobacco in the past, and lived in rural areas had higher self-reported exposures. Urban adolescents, non-Hispanic black or other racial/ethnic minority, and those living in neighborhoods with a higher percentage of poverty had more potential exposures to tobacco retailers in their path between home and school.Rural adolescents had more self-reported marketing exposures than urban adolescents. However, urban adolescents had more potential tobacco exposures between home and school. Thus, point of sale marketing limitations might be a more effective policy intervention in rural areas whereas limits on tobacco retailers might be more effective for urban areas.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28580278>FGF21 does not require adipocyte AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) to mediate improvements in whole-body glucose homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) shows great potential for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes, as its long-acting analogue reduces body weight and improves lipid profiles of participants in clinical studies; however, the intracellular mechanisms mediating these effects are poorly understood. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important energy sensor of the cell and a molecular target for anti-diabetic medications. This work examined the role of AMPK in mediating the glucose and lipid-lowering effects of FGF21.Inducible adipocyte AMPK β1β2 knockout mice (iβ1β2AKO) and littermate controls were fed a high fat diet (HFD) and treated with native FGF21 or saline for two weeks. Additionally, HFD-fed mice with knock-in mutations on the AMPK phosphorylation sites of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)1 and ACC2 (DKI mice) along with wild-type (WT) controls received long-acting FGF21 for two weeks.Consistent with previous studies, FGF21 treatment significantly reduced body weight, adiposity, and liver lipids in HFD fed mice. To add, FGF21 improved circulating lipids, glycemic control, and insulin sensitivity. These effects were independent of adipocyte AMPK and were not associated with changes in  of white (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). Lastly, we assessed whether FGF21 exerted its effects through the AMPK/ACC axis, which is critical in the therapeutic benefits of the anti-diabetic medication metformin. ACC DKI mice had improved glucose and insulin tolerance and a reduction in body weight, body fat and hepatic steatosis similar to WT mice in response to FGF21 administration.These data illustrate that the metabolic improvements upon FGF21 administration are independent of adipocyte AMPK, and do not require the inhibitory action of AMPK on ACC. This is in contrast to the anti-diabetic medication metformin and suggests that the treatment of obesity and diabetes with the combination of FGF21 and AMPK activators merits consideration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28357791>Role of brassinosteroids in alleviating toxin-induced stress of Verticillium dahliae on cotton callus growth.</a></h2><p>Brassinosteroids are well known to mitigate biotic stresses; however, their role to induce tolerance against Verticillium dahliae is unknown. The current study employed V. dahliae (Vd) toxin as pathogen-free model system to induce stress on cotton callus growth, and its amelioration was investigated using 24-epibrassinolide (EBR). Results revealed that EBR has ameliorative effects against Vd toxin with greater seen effect when callus was treated with EBR prior to its exposure to Vd toxin (pre-EBR treatment) than EBR applied along with Vd toxin simultaneously (co-EBR treatment). Pre-EBR-treated calli remained green, while 65 and 90% callus  was observed in co-EBR- and Vd toxin-alone-treated callus, respectively. Likewise, the fresh weight of the pre-EBR-treated callus was 52% higher than Vd toxin-alone treatment, whereas this increase was only 23% in co-EBR-treated callus. Meanwhile, EBR treatment of the cotton callus has also increased the contents of chlorophylls a and , carotenoids, total phenols, flavonoids, soluble sugars, and proteins and increased the activity of enzymes involved in secondary metabolism like polyphenol oxidase (PPO), phenylalanine ammonialyase (PAL), cinnamyl alchol dehydrogenase (CAD), and shikimate dehydrogenase (SKDH) over Vd toxin-alone treatment with higher increments being observed in pre-EBR-treated callus. Furthermore, EBR treatment mimicked the DNA damage and improved the structure of mitochondria, granum, stroma thylakoids, and the attachment of ribosomes with the endoplasmic reticulum. This EBR-mediated mitigation was primarily associated with substantially increased contents of photosynthetic pigments and regulation of secondary metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428094> Generation of Cytotoxic T Cells With Potential for Adoptive Tumor Immunotherapy of Multiple Myeloma.</a></h2><p>Multiple myeloma is a life-threatening hematological malignancy, which is rarely curable by conventional therapies.

We investigated induction of antigen-specific, cytotoxic T-lymphocytes to the well-defined tumor associated antigens (TAAs) hTERT, MUC1, MAGE-C1 and CS1, which have been shown to be expressed in a high proportion of cases of multiple myeloma. HLA-A2-peptide pentamer staining, interferon-γ and perforin ELISpot assays, as well as cytotoxicity assays were used. Following several rounds of  stimulation, the hybrid cell lines induced antigen-specific, cytotoxic T-lymphocytes to four candidate TAAs in PBLs from HLA-A2 multiple myeloma patients, using known HLA-A2 restricted peptide epitopes of the TAAs.

The highest values of gel strength and deformability, as shown by breaking force and penetration distance, were obtained at pH 7.5-8.0, while the lowest values were at pH 10.0 followed by pH 6.0 and pH 6.5, respectively. Two-step slow heating process increased the breaking strength value nearly two times higher than one-step fast heating. The effect of pH was strikingly high at pH 7.5 when gels were prepared using 2-step heating, indicating the pH dependence of endogenous transglutaminase. However, the highest gel strength was obtained at pH 8.0 when gels were prepared in fast heating. Whiteness value (L - 3b*) increased significantly (p < .05) as pH increased from 6.0 to 6.5, but thereafter decreased significantly (p < .05) as pH increased. L* value (lightness) and * value (yellowness) continuously decreased as the pH is shifted from 6.0 to 10. Fast heated gels showed the lowest yellowness, resulting in whiter appearance, probably due to the effect of reduced  reaction.The uniqueness of this study was to measure the combined effect of pH and heating conditions on the gel texture and color. There were various studies dealing with pH or heating conditions independently. As the primary character for surimi seafood is gel texture and color. The highest values of gel strength and deformability, as shown by breaking force and penetration distance, were obtained at pH 7.5-8.0, while the lowest values were at pH 10.0 followed by pH 6.0 and pH 6.5, respectively.

Their underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we functionalized Ag NPs (11 nm in diameter) with two biocompatible peptides (CALNN, CALNN to prepare positively and negatively charged Ag-peptide NPs (Ag-CALNN NPs, Ag-CALNN NPs), respectively. We used them as photostable plasmonic imaging probes to study charge-dependent efflux kinetics of BmrA (ABC) membrane transporter of single live  cells. Two strains of the cells, normal expression of BmrA (WT) or devoid of BmrA (ΔBmrA), were used to study the charge-dependent efflux kinetics of single NPs upon the expression of BmrA. The NPs (1.4 nM) were stable (non-aggregated) in a PBS buffer and biocompatible to the cells. We found the high dependent accumulation of the intracellular NPs in both WT and ΔBmrA upon the charge and concentration of NPs. Notably, the accumulation rates of the positively charged NPs in single live WT cells are nearly identical to those in ΔBmrA cells, showing independence upon the expression of BmrA. In contrast, the accumulation rates of the negatively charged NPs in WT are much lower than in ΔBmrA, showing high dependence upon the expression of BmrA and suggesting that BmrA extrude the negatively charged NPs, but not positively charged NPs, out of the WT. The accumulation of positively charged NPs in both WT and ΔBmrA increases nearly proportionally to the NP concentration. The accumulation of negatively charged NPs in ΔBmrA, but not in WT, also increases nearly proportionally to the NP concentration. These results suggest that both negatively and positively charged NPs enter the cells via passive diffusion driven by concentration gradients across the cellular membrane, and BmrA can only extrude the negatively charged NPs out of the WT. This study shows that single NP plasmon spectroscopy can serve as a powerful tool to identify single plasmonic NPs and to probe the charge-dependent efflux kinetics and function of single membrane transporters in single live cells in real time.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29652441>Reduction of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural formation by flavan-3-ols in Maillard reaction models and fried potato chips.</a></h2><p>5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is regarded as a thermal process contaminant in foods. Six flavan-3-ol fractions were isolated or semisynthesized from sorghum, cranberry and grape seed. Their unit compositions, interflavan linkages and degree of polymerization were characterized. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of flavan-3-ols on the formation of HMF in chemical reaction models and fried potato chips.Results showed that all flavan-3-ols significantly mitigated the HMF formation at concentrations of 50, 100 and 200 µg mL in the chemical model system, and the inhibition was positively related to dose. Using the food model, HMF content was reduced by about 50% when potato chips were soaked in an optimal concentration of 0.1 mg mL flavan-3-ol solutions before frying. Based on the same mass concentration, -type flavan-3-ols mitigated more HMF than A-type, and oligomeric proanthocyanidins had stronger inhibitory activity than polymers. At suitable addition levels (0.01-0.1 mg mL ), the  of auto-oxidized flavan-3-ols under high temperature compensated the anti- effect along with the supression of the Maillard reaction; therefore, the color of fried potato chips was not affected.This study demonstrates that flavan-3-ols could be effective additives for reducing HMF levels in fried potato chips without changing sensory properties. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27556496>The rhetoric and reality of nursing in aged care: views from the inside.</a></h2><p>Aged care services and nursing roles are evolving in response to policy reform and increasing consumer expectations, however the nursing workforce is declining in numbers.To examine registered nurses' perceptions and experiences of working in aged care.Descriptive, exploratory study involving thematic analysis of individual interviews.Key issues related to: professional role strain; workforce challenges; managing expectations, relationships and communication; balancing rights and risk in decision-making; changing models of care and impacts of policy and regulation.Expectations and perceptions of aged care nursing are unclear and conflicted.

The plaque formation, as well as subsequent calcification, involves not only endothelial cells but also connective tissue, and is closely related to a wide range of cardiovascular syndromes, that together constitute the number one cause of death in the Western World. High (HDL) and low (LDL) density lipoproteins are of particular interest in relation to atherosclerosis, due to their protective and harmful effects, respectively. In an effort to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this, and to identify factors determining lipid deposition and exchange at lipid membranes, we here employ neutron reflection (NR) and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) to study the effect of membrane charge on lipoprotein deposition and lipid exchange. Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) bilayers containing varying amounts of negatively charged dimyristoylphosphatidylserine (DMPS) were used to vary membrane charge. It was found that the amount of hydrogenous material deposited from either HDL or LDL to the bilayer depends only weakly on membrane charge density. In contrast, increasing membrane charge resulted in an increase in the amount of lipids removed from the supported lipid bilayer, an effect particularly pronounced for LDL. The latter effects are in line with previously reported observations on atherosclerotic plaque prone regions of long-term hyperlipidaemia and type 2 diabetic patients, and may also provide some molecular clues into the relation between oxidative stress and atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier .V.

In this study, the TNF family member cytokine lymphotoxin-like inducible protein that competes with glycoprotein D for herpesvirus entry on T cells (LIGHT), also known as TNF super family protein 14 (TNFSF14), can inhibit adipose precursor differentiation into beige adipocytes. In acute cold stress, LIGHT deficiency in mice accelerated  in the subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT). Further experiments showed that LIGHT interacting with lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTβR) on adipose precursors blocked beige fat biogenesis. LTβR signals attenuated the JNK pathway, which contributed to their antibeiging effect. Blocking JNK activation using a small molecular inhibitor prevented cold-induced scWAT beiging. Furthermore, LIGHT/LTβR signals acted as an attenuator of white adipogenesis. LIGHT deficiency in mice promoted obesity during high-fat diet feeding. These findings identify the LIGHT axis as a regulator of adipose tissue homeostasis and suggest that LIGHT signaling functions as a mechanism to divert energy in favor of immune activation.-Kou, Y., Liu, Q., Liu, W., Sun, H., Liang, M., Kong, F., Zhang, ., Wei, Y., Liu, Z., Wang, Y.

In vivo, obese SD rats induced by high fat diet (HFD) were randomly divided into three groups treated with oral gavage: (a) normal control diet with distilled water, () HFD with distilled water, (c) HFD with 800 mg LFBE/kg body weight (bw).In vitro, LFBE and the PC in the extraction significantly inhibited adipogenesis and potentiated  of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, rather than RBE. In vivo, we observed remarkable decreases in the body weight, serum lipid levels, white adipose tissue (WAT) weights and cell sizes of brown adipose tissues (BAT) in the LFBE group after 10 weeks.

Several serotypes of fowl adenovirus (FAdV) have been implicated in disease outbreaks, with and without immunosuppression as a predisposing factor. IBH usually occurs in flocks up to 30 days of age; it is seldom seen in older birds. The objective of this study was to determine whether the pathogenicity for older birds of three FAdV field strains, belonging to serotypes 1, 8b, and 11, in the absence of immunosuppressive factors, was akin to that for younger birds, and to establish an effective and economical disease model for assessing cross-protection between serotypes. To achieve this objective, the gross pathology, histopathology, and dissemination of virus were examined at multiple time points after inoculation of 6-wk-old, specific-pathogen-free chickens via intraperitoneal injection. Both FAdV-8b and FAdV-11 generated lesions typical of those associated with outbreaks of IBH, and they were shown to be primary pathogens. The presence and severity of hepatic lesions were used to define two disease stages: degeneration (1-5 days postinoculation) and convalescence (6-14 days postinoculation). During the degenerative stage, FAdV-8b was detected in the liver, kidney, and gizzard of most birds, whereas FAdV-11 was predominantly detected in the liver, and both viruses persisted in the gizzard into convalescence. The pathogenesis of two IBH-associated FAdV strains in 6-wk-old chickens confirms their high level of virulence and also provides an effective experimental model for investigation of cross-protection between FAdVs. It also demonstrates persistence of the virus in the gizzard long after infection, supporting the notion that it is a site of viral shedding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29622211>Characterization and comparison of the structure and antioxidant activity of glycosylated whey peptides from two pathways.</a></h2><p>Glycosylated whey peptides (WPP-Gal A and WPP-Gal ) were formed from two pathways.

Particularly, obesity-induced metabolic endotoxemia plays an important role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and inflammation. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key regulator of antioxidant signaling that serves as a primary cellular defense against the cytotoxic effects of oxidative stress. Pharmacological stimulation of Nrf2 mitigates obesity and insulin resistance in mice; however, Nrf2 activators are not clinically available due to biosafety concerns. A recent study demonstrated that glucoraphanin, a precursor of the Nrf2 activator sulforaphane, ameliorates obesity by enhancing energy expenditure and  of white adipose tissue, and attenuates obesity-related inflammation and insulin resistance by polarizing M2 macrophages and reducing metabolic endotoxemia. Thus, this review focuses on the efficiency and safety of glucoraphanin in alleviating obesity, insulin resistance, and NAFLD.

Within 6 hours after the return of circulation, comatose children older than 48 hours and younger than 18 years of age were randomly assigned to therapeutic hypothermia (target temperature, 33.0°C) or therapeutic normothermia (target temperature, 36.8°C). The primary efficacy outcome, survival at 12 months after cardiac arrest with a score of 70 or higher on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, second edition (VABS-II, on which scores range from 20 to 160, with higher scores indicating better function), was evaluated among patients who had had a VABS-II score of at least 70 before the cardiac arrest.The trial was terminated because of futility after 329 patients had undergone randomization. Among the 257 patients who had a VABS-II score of at least 70 before cardiac arrest and who could be evaluated, the rate of the primary efficacy outcome did not differ significantly between the hypothermia group and the normothermia group (36% [48 of 133 patients] and 39% [48 of 124 patients], respectively; relative risk, 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67 to 1.27; P=0.63). Among 317 patients who could be evaluated for change in neurobehavioral function, the change in VABS-II score from baseline to 12 months did not differ significantly between the groups (P=0.70).

High chronic inflammation is believed to be one biological pathway through which childhood adversity may affect health into adulthood. The Blackfeet tribal community has high rates of childhood trauma and community members are disproportionately affected by inflammatory diseases.To investigate whether belonging to the tribal community may moderate the relationship between childhood trauma and immune system inflammation in the Blackfeet tribal community.In a sample of 90 adults residing on the Blackfeet reservation, we measured ACEs belonging to the tribal community and two markers of immune system inflammation, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP).We found that independent of age, gender, annual income, body mass index, and depressive symptoms, belonging to the tribal community and ACEs interacted to predict levels of both IL-6 and CRP (= -.37, t[81] = -3.82, p < .001, R2 change = .07 and  = -.29, t[81] = -2.75, p = .01, R2 change = .08, respectively). The association between ACEs and markers of immune system inflammation was statistically significant for community members who reported low levels of belonging to the community.The findings of this study have important implications for intervention research seeking to reduce risk for inflammatory diseases for at-risk populations. Fostering stronger connections to the larger tribal community may positively affect risk for inflammatory diseases. Future work should examine the behavioral and psychosocial pathways through which stronger connections to community may confer health benefits.© The Author(s) 2019.

These immunopathological responses have been well-characterized in chickens, but have not been studied closely in turkeys. The aim of the study described here was to examine the immune responses of turkeys after live vaccination and infection with M. gallisepticum. In a strain comparison study, the mean log antibody titre of birds exposed to an aerosol culture of M. gallisepticum strain Ap3AS was found to be significantly higher at day 14 than that of birds exposed to strain 100809/31. In a dose-response study, there was a significant difference in the mean log antibody titre between birds exposed to mycoplasma broth and birds exposed to the highest dose of strain Ap3AS at day 7 after exposure. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tracheal mucosa and the air sacs revealed similar patterns of distribution of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes to those seen in the tracheal mucosa of chickens, implicating these cell types in the pathogenesis of respiratory mycoplasmosis in turkeys. Turkeys that had been vaccinated with M. gallisepticum GapA ts-11 had significantly higher antibody titres than unvaccinated birds at both 7 and 14 days after challenge with strain Ap3AS. Vaccination with GapA ts-11 protected against the lymphoproliferative response to infection with virulent M. gallisepticum in both the tracheal mucosa and the air sacs, suggesting that this strain may be a useful vaccine candidate for use in turkeys.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30219502>UV-screening and springtime recovery of photosynthetic capacity in leaves of Vaccinium vitis-idaea above and below the snow pack.</a></h2><p>Evergreen plants in boreal biomes undergo seasonal hardening and dehardening adjusting their photosynthetic capacity and photoprotection; acclimating to seasonal changes in temperature and irradiance. Leaf epidermal ultraviolet (UV)-screening by flavonols responds to solar radiation, perceived in part through increased ultraviolet- (UV-) radiation, and is a candidate trait to provide cross-photoprotection. At Hyytiälä Forestry Station, central Finland, we examined whether the accumulation of flavonols was higher in leaves of Vaccinium vitis-idaea L. growing above the snowpack compared with those below the snowpack. We found that leaves exposed to colder temperatures and higher solar radiation towards the top of hummocks suffered greater photoinhibition than those at the base of hummocks. Epidermal UV-screening was highest in upper-hummock leaves, particularly during winter when lower leaves were beneath the snowpack. There was also a negative relationship between indices of flavonols and anthocyanins across all leaves suggesting fine-tuning of flavonoid composition for screening vs. antioxidant activity in response to temperature and irradiance. However, the positive correlation between the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II photochemistry (F/F) and flavonol accumulation in upper hummock leaves during dehardening did not confer on them any greater cross-protection than would be expected from the general relationship of F/F with temperature and irradiance (throughout the hummocks). Irrespective of timing of snow-melt, photosynthesis fully recovered in all leaves, suggesting that V. vitis-idaea has the potential to exploit the continuing trend for longer growing seasons in central Finland without incurring significant impairment from reduced duration of snow cover.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In wine oxidation, phenolics are oxidized to quinones and these reactive compounds can be quenched by sacrificial nucleophiles, such as the A-ring on flavanoids, preventing oxidative damage from the loss of desirable flavor molecules. The "catechol" -ring on flavanoids, in contrast, can be oxidized by quinones through electron transfer reactions that lead to flavanoid quinones, precursors of  products. Here we compared the rate of flavanoids reacting by either nucleophilic quinone quenching, or by electron transfer to generate flavanoid quinones. Our approach is based on mathematical modeling of reaction data to derive the rate constants of reactions of A-ring quenching vs -ring electron transfer with caffeic acid quinone, by fitting the predicted loss of precursors and the appearance of products (or derivatives) with experimental data collected by LC/MS. The rate constant of the electron transfer reaction of caffeic acid quinone towards 4-methyl-catechol was fast (k  = 3.43E-2 mLmolsec) but nucleophilic reactions with afzelechin (k  = 2.53E-3 mLmolsec) or malvidin-3-glucoside (k  = 5.34E-3 mLmolsec), were much slower. No reaction was detected between caffeic acid quinone and isorhamnetin. Additionally, the electron transfer reaction rate of catechin and caffeic acid quinone was much faster at pH 7 (1.22E-02 mLmolsec) vs pH 3.5 (1.79E-03 mLmolsec). These results help explain why the reaction of catechin and caffeic acid quinone favors the formation of  products, and more so at higher pH values. Furthermore, bisulfite reacted with quinones faster than the electron transfer reactions, preventing the  observed in the reaction of catechin with caffeic acid quinone in the absence of bisulfite.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier .V.

Here, we report Pt nanoparticles assembled on vacancy-abundant hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets and their use as a model catalyst to embrace an interfacial electronic effect on Pt induced by the nanosheets with N-vacancies and -vacancies for superior CO oxidation catalysis. Experimental results indicate that strong interaction exists between Pt and the vacancies. Bader charge analysis shows that with Pt on -vacancies, the nanosheets serve as a Lewis acid to accept electrons from Pt, and on the contrary, when Pt sits on N-vacancies, the nanosheets act as a Lewis base for donating electrons to Pt. The overall-electronic effect demonstrates an electron-rich feature of Pt after assembling on hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets.

Heme  concentrations are low (<1 pmol L) in iron limited phytoplankton in cultures and in the field. Here, we determined heme  in marine particulate material (>0.7 μm) from the North Atlantic Ocean (GEOVIDE cruise - GEOTRACES section GA01), which spanned several biogeochemical regimes. We examined the relationship between heme  abundance and the microbial community composition, and its utility for mapping iron limited phytoplankton. Heme  concentrations ranged from 0.16 to 5.1 pmol L (median = 2.0 pmol L,  = 62) in the surface mixed layer (SML) along the cruise track, driven mainly by variability in biomass. However, in the Irminger Basin, the lowest heme  levels (SML: median = 0.53 pmol L,  = 12) were observed, whilst the biomass was highest (particulate organic carbon, median = 14.2 μmol L,  = 25; chlorophyll : median = 2.0 nmol L,  = 23) pointing to regulatory mechanisms of the heme  pool for growth conservation. Dissolved iron (DFe) was not depleted (SML: median = 0.38 nmol L,  = 11) in the Irminger Basin, but large diatoms ( sp.) dominated. Hence, heme  depletion and regulation is likely to occur during bloom progression when phytoplankton class-dependent absolute iron requirements exceed the available ambient concentration of DFe. Furthermore, high heme  concentrations found in the Iceland Basin and Labrador Sea (median = 3.4 pmol L,  = 20), despite having similar DFe concentrations to the Irminger Basin, were attributed to an earlier growth phase of the extant phytoplankton populations. Thus, heme  provides a snapshot of the cellular activity  and could both be used as indicator of iron limitation and contribute to understanding phytoplankton adaptation mechanisms to changing iron supplies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29232178>Rapid Decrease in KRT14 and TP53 mRNA Expression in the Buccal Mucosa of Patients Receiving Total-Body Irradiation for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation.</a></h2><p>The only curative treatment option for relapsed patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Depletion of hematopoietic stem cells and leukemic blast cells is achieved through the systemic administration of DNA damaging agents, including total-body irradiation (TBI) prior to transplantation. Since other tissues are radiosensitive, the identification of biomarkers could facilitate the management of additional toxicities. Buccal keratinocytes are readily accessible and could provide a source of cells for RNA analysis. In this study, we obtained miRNAs and mRNAs from daily buccal swabs collected from patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Unexpectedly, there was no prominent p53-induced mRNA or miRNA response in these samples, despite the fact that the p53 pathway is a well-characterized radiation-inducible response.

We performed a genome-wide association study of platelet count in 12,491 participants of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos by using a mixed-model method that accounts for admixture and family relationships. We discovered and replicated associations with five genes (ACTN1, ETV7, GABBR1-MOG, MEF2C, and ZBTB9-BAK1). Our strongest association was with Amerindian-specific variant rs117672662 (p value = 1.16 × 10(-28)) in ACTN1, a gene implicated in congenital macrothrombocytopenia. rs117672662 exhibited allelic differences in transcriptional activity and protein binding in hematopoietic cells.

The present set of studies is an exploratory analysis of a structured feedback method for training time-out using repeated role-plays. The three studies examined (a) a between-subjects comparison to more a traditional didactic/video modeling method of time-out training, () a within-subjects comparison to traditional didactic/video modeling training for another skill, and (c) the impact of structured feedback training on in-home time-out implementation. Though findings are only preliminary and more research is needed, the structured feedback method appears across studies to be an efficient, effective method that demonstrates good maintenance of skill up to 3 months post training. Findings suggest, though do not confirm, a benefit of the structured feedback method over a more traditional didactic/video training model. Implications and further research on the method are discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29396369>Cardiac natriuretic peptides promote adipose '' through mTOR complex-1.</a></h2><p>Activation of thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and the ability to increase uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) levels and mitochondrial biogenesis in white fat (termed ''), has great therapeutic potential to treat obesity and its comorbidities because of the net increase in energy expenditure. β-adrenergic-cAMP-PKA signaling has long been known to regulate these processes. Recently PKA-dependent activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) was shown to be necessary for adipose '' as well as proper development of the interscapular BAT. In addition to cAMP-PKA signaling pathways, cGMP-PKG signaling also promotes this  process; however, it is unclear whether or not mTORC1 is also necessary for cGMP-PKG induced .Activation of mTORC1 by natriuretic peptides (NP), which bind to and activate the membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase, NP receptor A (NPRA), was assessed in mouse and human adipocytes in vitro and mouse adipose tissue in vivo.Activation of mTORC1 by NP-cGMP signaling was observed in both mouse and human adipocytes.

We concentrated on the changes in metabolite profiles of trifoliate orange leaves and roots as a consequence of  deficiency at the initial stage of growth by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics. Enlargement and  of root tips were observed in -deficient plants, while any obvious symptom was not recorded in the leaves after 30 days of  deprivation. The distinct patterns of alterations in metabolites observed in leaves and roots due to  deficiency suggest the presence of specific organ responses to  starvation. The accumulation of soluble sugars was occurred in leaves, which may be attributed to down-regulated pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and amino acid biosynthesis under  deficiency, while the amount of most amino acids in roots was increased, indicating that the effects of  deficiency on amino acids metabolism in trifoliate orange may be a consequence of disruptions in root tissues and decreased protein biosynthesis. Several important products of shikimate pathway were also significantly affected by  deficiency, which may be related to abnormal growth of roots induced by  deficiency. Conclusively, our results revealed a global perspective of the discriminative metabolism responses appearing between -deprived leaves and roots and provided new insight into the relationship between  deficiency symptom in roots and the altered amino acids profiling and shikimate pathway induced by  deficiency during seedling establishment.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Often, the complexity of the methodology hinders the actionable outcomes. The approach used here illustrates the importance of considering uncertainty in future climate projections, at the same time providing robust and simple to interpret information for decision-makers. By quantifying current and future exposure of Royal Gala apple to damaging temperature extremes across ten important pome fruit-growing locations in Australia, differences in impact to ripening fruit are highlighted, with, by the end of the twenty-first century, some locations maintaining no sunburn  risk, while others potentially experiencing the risk for the majority of the January ripening period. Installation of over-tree netting can reduce the impact of sunburn . The benefits from employing this management option varied across the ten study locations. The two approaches explored to assist decision-makers assess this information (a) using sunburn  risk analogues and () through identifying hypothetical sunburn  risk thresholds, resulted in varying recommendations for introducing over-tree netting. These recommendations were location and future time period dependent with some sites showing no benefit for sunburn protection from nets even by the end of the twenty-first century and others already deriving benefits from employing this adaptation option. Potential best and worst cases of sunburn  risk and its potential reduction through introduction of over-tree nets were explored. The range of results presented highlights the importance of addressing uncertainty in climate projections that result from different global climate models and possible future emission pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27671526>Regulation, sensory domains and roles of two Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC27774 Crp family transcription factors, HcpR1 and HcpR2, in response to nitrosative stress.</a></h2><p>In silico analyses identified a Crp/Fnr family transcription factor (HcpR) in sulfate-reducing bacteria that controls expression of the hcp gene, which encodes the hybrid cluster protein and contributes to nitrosative stress responses. There is only one hcpR gene in the model sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough, but two copies in Desulfovibrio desulfuricans 27774, which can use nitrate as an alternative electron acceptor to sulfate. Structures of the D. desulfuricans hcpR1, hcpR2 and hcp operons are reported. We present evidence that hcp expression is regulated by HcpR2, not by HcpR1, and that these two regulators differ in both their DNA-binding site specificity and their sensory domains. HcpR1 is predicted to be a -type cytochrome. HcpR1 binds upstream of the hcpR1 operon and its synthesis is regulated coordinately with hcp in response to NO. In contrast, hcpR2 expression was not induced by nitrate, nitrite or NO. HcpR2 is an iron-sulfur protein that reacts with NO and O . We propose that HcpR1 and HcpR2 use different sensory mechanisms to regulate subsets of genes required for defense against NO-induced nitrosative stress, and that diversification of signal perception and DNA recognition by these two proteins is a product of D. desulfuricans adaptation to its particular environmental niche.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28509707>Burden of Psychosocial and Cognitive Impairment in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation.</a></h2><p>Impairments in psychosocial status and cognition relate to poor clinical outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).

Cognitive function, depression, and anxiety were assessed at baseline and AF-specific QoL was assessed 6 months after enrollment using validated instruments. Demographic and clinical information were obtained from a structured interview and medical record review.The mean age of the study participants was 63.5 ± 10.2 years, 35% were male, and 81% had paroxysmal AF. Prevalences of impairment in 1, 2, and 3 psychosocial/cognitive domains (eg, depression, anxiety, or cognition) were 75 (34.4%), 51 (23.4%), and 16 (7.3%), respectively. Patients with co-occurring psychosocial/cognitive impairments (eg, >1 domain) were older, more likely to smoke, had less education, and were more likely to have heart failure (all P < 0.05).

A recently developed cultivar, Okayama PEH7, was distinct from other Japanese cultivars, including Okayama PEH8, with respect to its reduced  potential. Homogenate prepared from Okayama PEH7 flesh had significantly less reddening during the  reaction. Okayama PEH7 had less soluble phenolic compounds and higher polyphenol oxidase activity than Okayama PEH8. Reduced  was observed even when phenols prepared from Okayama PEH7 were incubated with crude extract from Okayama PEH8, suggesting that phenols lower the  potential of Okayama PEH7. In Okayama PEH7, contents of chlorogenic acid and its isomers were about one-tenth compared to Okayama PEH8. Exogenous addition of chlorogenic acid to Okayama PEH7 homogenate increased the  potential and visibly enhanced reddening.

Five beef bone hydrolysates obtained from single (P-Protamex®, -bromelain, and F-Flavourzyme®) and simultaneous (P + F and  + F) enzymatic hydrolysis treatments were combined with ribose in aqueous solutions and heated at 113 °C to produce Maillard reaction products (MRPs). Total free amino acids decreased after heat treatment indicating the occurrence of the MR. MRPs showed a decrease in pH and an increase in  intensity as the degree of hydrolysis of hydrolysates increased. The volatiles compounds generated during heat treatment were evaluated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with headspace solid phase microextraction (SPME) sampling. A total of 40 volatile compounds were identified in all MRPs and their concentration were found to increase with increasing degree of hydrolysis. Pyrazines were the most abundant class of compounds produced as a result of the MR. F-MRP showed the highest peak area intensity for 17 volatile compounds in single hydrolysis treatment followed by heat treatment. There was also no significant difference in those major volatile compounds between F-MRP and P + F-MRP or  + F-MRP from simultaneous hydrolysis treatment after heating. Hence, the use of Flavourzyme® alone to increase the flavour intensity of beef bone extract is recommended. Overall results indicated that enzymatic hydrolysis and MR could be used to modify the flavour characters of beef bone extract.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Coffee by-products extracts (31-500 μg mL) and pure phenolics (100 μmol L) reduced lipid accumulation and increased mitochondrial activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Also reduced the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 and diminished secretion of pro-inflammatory factors in LPS-stimulated RAW2643.7 macrophages. Cytokine release diminished (tumor necrosis factor α: 23-57%; monocyte chemoattractant protein 1: 42-60%; interleukin-6: 30-39%) and adiponectin increased (7-13- fold) in adipocytes treated with macrophage-conditioned media. ROS scavenging and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α pathway counteracted mitochondrial dysfunction. Increases in insulin receptor (1.4 to 4-fold), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (2 to 3-fold) and protein kinase  (1.3 to 3-fold) phosphorylation, in conjunction with a decrease in serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1, evoked glucose transporter 4 translocation (8-15-fold) and glucose uptake (44-85%). CSE and CHE phenolics inhibited adipogenesis and elicited adipocytes . Suppressing macrophages-adipocytes interaction alleviated inflammation-triggered mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance.

The action of tyrosinase on caffeic acid and its n-nonyl ester (n-nonyl caffeate) was characterized kinetically in this work. The results lead us to propose that both compounds are suicide substrates of tyrosinase, for which we establish the catalytic and inactivation efficiencies. The ester is more potent as inactivator than the caffeic acid and the number of turnovers made by one molecule of the enzyme before its inactivation (r) is lower for the ester.

We have successfully synthesized biocompatible, and biodegradable R encapsulated lipid nanocarriers (R-nano), and R encapsulated liposomes (R-lipo). The mean particle size of R-nano and R-lipo were 140 nm and 110 nm, respectively, and their polydispersity index values were less than 0.2. Nanoencapsulation significantly increased aqueous solubility and enhanced chemical stability of R, especially at 37 °C. R-lipo had higher physical and chemical stability than R-nano while R-nano had more prolonged release than R-lipo. Both R-nano and R-lipo increased cellular R content in 3T3-L1 cells. Both R-nano and R-lipo dose-dependently induced uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) mRNA expression and decreased white specific marker insulin growth factor binding protein 3 expression under isoproterenol (ISO)-stimulated conditions. At the low dose (5 μM), nanoencapsulated compared to native R enhanced UCP1 and beige marker CD137 expression under ISO-stimulated conditions. Compared to R-nano, R-lipo had better biological activity, possibly due to its higher physical and chemical stability at the room and body temperature. Taken together, our study demonstrates that nanoencapsulation increased R's aqueous solubility and stability, which led to enhanced  of white adipocytes.

Functional deficiency of tyrosinase results in serious dermatological diseases. Tyrosinase also participates in neuromelanin formation in the human brain, which leads to neurodegeneration resulting in Parkinson's disease. In fruits and vegetables, tyrosinase plays a critical role in senescence, causing undesired  that results in faster deterioration and shorter shelf lines. The only commercially available tyrosinase is mushroom tyrosinase and it shows the highest homology to the mammalian tyrosinase. Although kojic acid is currently used as a tyrosinase inhibitor, they have serious side effects such as dermatitis, carcinogenesis and hepatotoxicity. Therefore, in order to develop a more active and safer tyrosinase inhibitor, 3D QSAR pharmacophore models were generated based on experimentally known inhibitors. The pharmacophore model, Hypo1, was developed with a large cost difference, high correlation coefficient and low RMS deviation. Hypo1 showed a good spatial arrangement; consisting of five-point features including two hydrogen bond acceptor, one hydrogen bond donor and two hydrophobic features. Hypo1 was further validated by cost analysis, test set and Fisher's randomisation method. Hypo1 was used as a 3D query for screening the in-house drug-like databases, and the hits were further selected by applying ADMET, Lipinski's rule of five and fit value criteria. To identify binding conformations, the obtained hits were subjected to molecular docking. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations revealed the appropriate binding modes of hit compounds.

We demonstrate in whole blood from patients with CLL that lenalidomide significantly depletes malignant  cells. Lenalidomide also induced production of interleukin-21 (IL21) and its mRNA in T cells from patients with CLL. In addition, lenalidomide enhanced upregulation of functional IL21 receptor (IL21R) on the cell surface and increased receptor mRNA in vitro The in vitro combination of IL21 and lenalidomide enhanced IL21-mediated cytotoxicity toward CLL cells through a variety of mechanisms. We show association of cell death with upregulation of Bid by IL21, enhanced upregulation of Bid by the combination therapy, and diminished Lck and downstream BCR signaling activation of Syk and PLCG2. Collectively, we demonstrated an immune cell-tumor cell interaction through lenalidomide-mediated induction of IL21 and IL21R, with enhanced IL21-mediated cytotoxicity, which provides justification for this combination in clinical trials for patients with CLL.

Promoting  of white adipose tissue (WAT) contributes to increased energy expenditure and hence counteracts obesity. Here we show that cordycepin (Cpn), a natural derivative of adenosine, increases energy expenditure, inhibits weight gain, improves metabolic profile and glucose tolerance, decreases WAT mass and adipocyte size, and enhances cold tolerance in normal and high-fat diet-fed mice. Cpn markedly increases the surface temperature around the inguinal WAT and turns the inguinal fat browner. Further investigations show that Cpn induces the development of brown-like adipocytes in inguinal and, to a less degree, epididymal WAT depots. Cpn also increases the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and other thermogenic genes in WAT and 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes, in which AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays an important role. Our results provide novel insights into the function of Cpn in regulating energy balance, and suggest a potential utility of Cpn in the treatment of obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31274920>Effect of steam parboiling and hot soaking treatments on milling yield, physical, physicochemical, bioactive and digestibility properties of buckwheat ( L.).</a></h2><p>Post-harvest hydrothermal processing of grains are targeted at improving milling performances and nutritional properties. In this study, the effects of two hydrothermal processes, namely steam parboiling and soaking in boiling water for different durations on properties of buckwheat ( L.) grown in the Indian Himalayan regions were assessed. Both treatments significantly improved milling yield. Changes in grain section morphology were evidenced under scanning electron microscope. Milder processing for 5 and 10 min mostly exerted annealing effect, represented by increased intensities of X-ray diffraction peaks. Starch gelatinization occurred upon prolonged processing for 15 and 20 min. This resulted in decreased crystallinity, increased sedimentation volume, paste thinning during rapid viscosity analysis and lower thermal transition in differential scanning calorimetry. Marginal changes in oil uptake suggested limited protein denaturation. Natural antioxidant compounds were variably denatured. Maillard  was indicated by CIE L* a* * colour and antioxidant levels. The starchy flour samples showed partial resistance to enzymatic amylolysis post retrogradation. Soaking in boiling water can be considered as a feasible alternative to conventional steam parboiling for better milling yield of buckwheat. Altered physicochemical and nutritional properties of buckwheat suggested that the hydrothermally modified flours can be used in ready to eat therapeutic food products.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162679>Effects of microwave vacuum drying and conventional drying methods on the physicochemical and microstructural properties of squid shreds.</a></h2><p>Microwave vacuum drying is an innovative technology for drying fruits and vegetables. However, this technology has not been well explored for drying seafood. In the present study, the effects of microwave vacuum drying (MVD), hot air drying (HAD) and sun drying (SD) on the proximate composition, texture, rehydration, color and microstructure of squid shreds were investigated.Proximate components of the samples dried by different methods were not significantly different, but the drying time was markedly lower for the MVD technique. The rehydration rate and water absorption index followed the order MVD > HAD > SD. The extent of  as indicated by the * value was significantly lower in MVD samples (14.38) compared with HAD (19.47) and SD (21.94) samples. MVD resulted in the lowest values for hardness, springiness and chewiness of both dried and rehydrated squid shreds, while SD recorded the highest values for the same. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the muscle fiber indicated muscle shrinkage and more toughness in SD samples, whereas Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra revealed a small extent of protein degradation in MVD samples.The study revealed that higher-quality dried squid shreds can be prepared by microwave vacuum drying in a shorter time compared with the traditional methods of sun drying and hot air drying.

Fresh-cut mangoes were subjected to PL treatments: control (0P), 1 pulse (1P; 0.7 J cm), 4 successive pulses (4P; 2.80 J cm) and 1 pulse per day for 4 days (1P4D; 2.80 J cm) before storage for 7 days at 6 °C. The 1P and the 4P treatments reduced fresh mass loss during storage, while 4P-treated samples also showed a slower decline of yellow color, as shown by parameter  and overall better visual appearance. After 7 days of storage, total ascorbate content was 40% higher in the 1P4D treatment than in control, whereas total carotenoid content (0.894 mg g FM) and total antioxidant activity (144 μmol trolox 100 g FM) were the highest in the 4P-treated samples.

In particular we wished to explore the potential for basic neuroscience to support the development of more effective psychological treatments, just as this approach is starting to illuminate the actions of drugs. To fulfil this aim, a selection of clinical psychologists, psychiatrists and neuroscientists were invited to sit at the same table. The starting point of the meeting was the proposition that we know certain psychological treatments work, but we have only an approximate understanding of why they work. The first task in developing a coherent mental health science would therefore be to uncover the mechanisms (at all levels of analysis) of effective psychological treatments. Delineating these mechanisms, a task that will require input from both the clinic and the laboratory, will provide a key foundation for the rational optimisation of psychological treatments. As reviewed in this paper, the speakers at the meeting reviewed recent advances in the understanding of clinical and cognitive psychology, neuroscience, experimental psychopathology, and treatment delivery technology focussed primarily on anxiety disorders and depression. We started by asking three rhetorical questions: What has psychology done for treatment? What has technology done for psychology? What has neuroscience done for psychology? We then addressed how research in five broad research areas could inform the future development of better treatments: Attention, Conditioning, Compulsions and addiction, Emotional Memory, and Reward and emotional bias. Research in all these areas (and more) can be harnessed to neuroscience since psychological therapies are a learning process with a biological basis in the brain. Because current treatment approaches are not fully satisfactory, there is an imperative to understand why not. And when psychological therapies do work we need to understand why this is the case, and how we can improve them. We may be able to improve accessibility to treatment without understanding mechanisms. But for treatment innovation and improvement, mechanistic insights may actually help. Applying neuroscience in this way will become an additional mission for ECNP.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier .V.

Yet the effects of collaboration on PM are largely unknown. Adopting the methodology of the "collaborative recall paradigm", we tested whether stranger dyads (Experiment 1) and intimate couples (Experiment 2) would perform better on a "Virtual Week" task when working together or each working separately. In Experiment 1, we found evidence of collaborative inhibition: collaborating strangers did not perform to their pooled individual potential, although the effect was modulated by PM task difficulty. We also found that the overall collaborative inhibition effect was attributable to both the retrospective and prospective components of PM. In Experiment 2 however, there was no collaborative inhibition: there was no significant difference in performance between couples working together or separately. Our findings suggest potential costs of collaboration to PM. Intimate relationships may reduce the usual costs of collaboration, with implications for intervention training programmes and for populations who most need PM support.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554048>Natural extracts from grape seed and stem by-products in combination with colloidal silver as alternative preservatives to SO for white wines: Effects on chemical composition and sensorial properties.</a></h2><p>The search for alternative additives to sulfur dioxide, with antioxidant and antimicrobial activity, in the production of wines is one of the current objectives of the enological industry. In the present study, aqueous extracts obtained from winery byproducts (grape seeds and stems), alone or in combination with colloidal silver complex, have been used in white vinification. The antimicrobial effect of the extracts was similar to that of sulfur dioxide, being more effective on lactic and acetic bacteria in those wines to which colloidal silver was added. The effect on the color, the phenolic compounds and the volatile fraction of the wines was evaluated, as well as their sensory profile. The use of both extracts modified the color of the wines, increasing the chromatic parameters a* and *, indicating a  tendency, although no other signs of oxidation were found. Wines with seed extracts contained higher amounts of flavan-3-ols, and a significant increase in some volatile compounds such as fatty acid ethyl esters and benzene compounds, which were identified in the extracts. From a sensorial point of view, the wines with stem extracts were the most similar to those elaborated with SO, detecting a certain bitterness in wines with seed extracts.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Mothers and infants were followed through week 48 after delivery. The primary outcome was a composite of treatment-related maternal adverse events of grade 3 or higher or permanent discontinuation of the trial regimen because of toxic effects. The noninferiority margin was an upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the between-group difference in the rate of the primary outcome of less than 5 events per 100 person-years.A total of 956 women were enrolled. A primary outcome event occurred in 72 of 477 women (15.1%) in the immediate group and in 73 of 479 (15.2%) in the deferred group (incidence rate, 15.03 and 14.93 events per 100 person-years, respectively; rate difference, 0.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.77 to 4.98, which met the criterion for noninferiority). Two women in the immediate group and 4 women in the deferred group died (incidence rate, 0.40 and 0.78 per 100 person-years, respectively; rate difference, -0.39; 95% CI, -1.33 to 0.56); all deaths occurred during the postpartum period, and 4 were from liver failure (2 of the women who died from liver failure had received isoniazid [1 in each group]). Tuberculosis developed in 6 women (3 in each group); the incidence rate was 0.60 per 100 person-years in the immediate group and 0.59 per 100 person-years in the deferred group (rate difference, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.94 to 0.96).

Implication for exercise in obesity.</a></h2><p>A biological activity of myokine irisin, has been intensively investigated in the context of a  process occurring in white adipose tissue, but its role as a modulator of immune response has been little studied. The aim of our study was to determine the impact of irisin (0 - 100 nM) on pro-inflammatory activation of adipocyte 3T3 L1 cell line. Irisin reduced in a concentration-dependent manner the expression and activity of major proinflammatory cytokines, e.g. tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) expression and their secretion into cell medium. Moreover, irisin enhanced adiponectin synthesis reversing the effect of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced attenuation of this adipokine expression. The opposite effect was observed for leptin whose expression increased by LPS and this effect was suppressed by irisin application. A decreased phosphorylation and activation of nuclear factor kappa  (NFκ) in the presence of irisin suggests that mechanism of action irisin involves the inhibition of an inflammatory transcription factor. Irisin exerts also an inhibitory effect on macrophage migration toward chemoattractants present in adipocyte supernatants. Among the specific molecules secreted by adipocytes was monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) whose expression was suppressed by irisn. In majority of experiments irisin was effective in 100 nM concentration but in some of them the inhibitory effects occurred already in a concentration of 50 nM of this peptide. This study for the first time showed that adipocytes are directly affected by irisin and provides an evidence on anti-inflammatory action of irisin on fat cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27862091>Predictors of adequate ultrasound quality for hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance in patients with cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>Abdominal ultrasound fails to detect over one-fourth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at an early stage in patients with cirrhosis.

The primary outcome, survival with favorable 12-month neurobehavioral outcome (Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales [VABS-II]), did not differ between treatment groups in either trial. Neurologists examined 181 12-month survivors, described findings using the novel semi-quantitative Pediatric Resuscitation after Cardiac Arrest (PRCA) form, and rated findings in 6 domains; scores ranged from 0 (no deficits) to 21 (maximal deficits). PRCA scores were compared with 12-month VABS-II scores and cognitive scores.Neurologic outcome PRCA scores were classified as no/minimal impairment, PRCA 0-3, 81/179 (45%); mild impairment, PRCA 4-7, 24/179 (13%); moderate impairment, PRCA 8-11, 15/179 (8%); severe impairment, PRCA 12-16, 20/179 (11%); profound impairment, PRCA 17-21, 39/179 (21%) (2/181 incomplete). VABS-II scores correlated strongly with PRCA category ( = -0.88,  < 0.0001, Pearson correlation coefficient) and cognitive scores ( = -0.72,  < 0.0001). Factors associated with poor outcomes included out-of-hospital CA, seizure recognition in the early postarrest period, and poor neurologic status at hospital discharge.The PRCA provides a robust method for depicting neurologic outcomes after acute encephalopathy caused by CA in children. It provides a global semiquantitative rating of neurologic impairment and domain-specific impairment.

C57/BL6 mice had free access to a 60% HFD for 8 weeks, with or without intermittent restraint stress (3 h) conducted 3 times a week. HFD administration increased fat accumulation in liver tissues. Unlike the stressed standard diet group, the levels of hepatic total cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly ameliorated in the HFD with stress group compared to the HFD alone group. These beneficial results were in accordance with serum levels of liver enzymes (AST, ALT) and hepatic levels of TNF-α and oxidative stress parameters (ROS, NO, and malondialdehyde). The intermittent restraint stress significantly attenuated the HFD-derived alterations in serum insulin levels, hepatic protein kinase  (AKT) activity and gene expression especially related to lipogenesis. This intermittent restraint stress also elevated the serum epinephrine concentration and activated the adrenergic receptor β2 or β 3 in livers or WAT. The activations of energy expenditure markers (UCP1, PGC1α) in brown adipose tissue and the  of WAT were also observed in the HFD with stress group. Taken together, our findings showed the beneficial effects of sympathetic activation by intermittent restraint stress on HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and partial inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28071003>New model for colour kinetics of plum under infrared vacuum condition and microwave drying.</a></h2><p>Quality of dried foods is affected by the drying method and physiochemical changes in tissue. The drying method affects properties such as colour. The colour of processed food is one of the most important quality indices and plays a determinant role in consumer acceptability of food materials and the processing method. The colour of food materials can be used as an indirect factor to determine changes in quality, since it is simpler and faster than chemical methods.The study focused on the kinetics of colour changes of plum slices, under infrared vacuum and microwave conditions. Drying the samples was implemented at the absolute pressures of 20 and 60 kPa, drying temperatures of 50 and 60°C and microwave power of 90, 270, 450 and 630 W. Colour changes were quantified by the tri-stimulus L* (whiteness/darkness), a* (redness/greenness) and * (yellowness/blueness) model, which is an international standard for color measurement developed by the Commission Internationale d'Eclairage (CIE). These values were also used to calculate total colour change (∆E), chroma, hue angle, and  index (BI). A new model was used for mathematical modelling of colour change kinetics.The drying process changed the colour parameters of L*, a*, and *, causing a colour shift toward the darker region. The values of L* and hue angle decreased, whereas the values of a*, *, ∆E, chroma and  index increased during exposure to infrared vacuum conditions and microwave drying. Comparing the results obtained using the new model with two conventional models of zero-order and first-order kinetics indicated that the new model presented more compatibility with the data of colour kinetics for all colour parameters and drying conditions.All kinetic changes in colour parameters can be explained by the new model presented in this study. The hybrid drying system included infrared vacuum conditions and microwave power for initial slow drying of plum slices and provided the desired results for colour change.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30721625>Fndc5 loss-of-function attenuates exercise-induced  of white adipose tissue in mice.</a></h2><p>Fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (Fndc5) is a transmembrane protein highly expressed in the skeletal muscle. It was reported that exercise promotes the shedding of the extracellular domain of Fndc5, generating a circulating peptide (irisin) that cross-talks to adipose tissues to convert lipid-storing white adipocytes to energy-catabolizing beige adipocytes. However, the requirement of Fndc5 in mediating the beneficial effect of exercise remains to be determined. Here, we created a mouse model of Fndc5 mutation through transcription activator-like effector nuclease-mediated DNA targeting. The Fndc5 mutant mice have normal skeletal muscle development, growth, regeneration, as well as glucose and lipid metabolism at resting state, even when fed a high-fat diet. In response to running exercise, however, the Fndc5 mutant mice exhibit reduced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and have lower maximal oxygen consumption compared with the exercised wild-type mice. Mechanistically, Fndc5 mutation attenuates exercise-induced  of white adipose tissue that is crucial for the metabolic benefits of physical activities. These data provide genetic evidence that Fndc5 is dispensable for muscle development and basal metabolism but essential for exercise-induced  of white adipose tissues in mice.-Xiong, Y., Wu, Z., Zhang, ., Wang, C., Mao, F., Liu, X., Hu, K., Sun, X., Jin, W., Kuang, S.

Deposition of excess triglycerides in liver cells, a hallmark of NAFLD, is associated with loss of insulin sensitivity. Ostreolysin (Oly) is a 15-kDa fungal protein known to interact with cholesterol-enriched raft-like membrane domains. We aim to test whether a recombinant version of Oly (rOly) can induce functional changes in vitro in adipocytes or in vivo in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD).White preadipocyte 3T3-L1 cells or mouse primary adipocytes treated with rOly. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a control or HFD and treated with saline or with rOly (1 mg/kg BW) every other day for 4 weeks.White preadipocyte 3T3-L1 cells or mouse primary adipocytes treated with rOly acquire a  phenotype through activation of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and downregulation of tumor necrosis factor α-mediated activation of Iκ kinase ε and TANK-binding kinase 1. HFD-fed mice treated with rOly showed a 10% reduction in BW and improved glucose tolerance, which paralleled improved expression of liver and adipose functionality, metabolism, and inflammation status, mimicking the in vitro findings.This study provides first evidence of rOly's prevention of HFD-induced NAFLD by stimulating liver and adipose muscle tissue functionality and oxidative potential, improving glucose tolerance, and ameliorating the metabolic profile of diet-induced obese mice.© 2018 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27244444>Using Neutron Reflectometry to Discern the Structure of Fibrinogen Adsorption at the Stainless Steel/Aqueous Interface.</a></h2><p>Neutron reflectometry has been successfully used to study adsorption on a stainless steel surface by means of depositing a thin steel film on silicon. The film was characterized using XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy), TOF-SIMS (time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry), and GIXRD (grazing incidence X-ray diffraction), demonstrating the retention both of the austenitic phase and of the required composition for 316L stainless steel. The adsorption of fibrinogen from a physiologically-relevant solution onto the steel surface was studied using neutron reflectometry and QCM (quartz crystal microbalance) and compared to that on a deposited chromium oxide surface. It was found that the protein forms an irreversibly bound layer at low concentrations, with maximum protein concentration a distance of around 20 Å from the surface. Evidence for a further diffuse reversibly-bound layer forming at higher concentrations was also observed. Both the structure of the layer revealed by the neutron reflectometry data and the high water retention predicted by the QCM data suggest that there is a significant extent of protein unfolding upon adsorption. A lower extent of adsorption was seen on the chromium surfaces, although the adsorbed layer structures were similar, suggesting comparable adsorption mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27063080>FNDC5/irisin, a molecular target for boosting reward-related learning and motivation.</a></h2><p>Interventions focusing on the prevention and treatment of chronic non-communicable diseases are on rise. In the current article, we propose that dysfunction of the mesocortico-limbic reward system contributes to the emergence of the WHO-identified risk behaviors (tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol), behaviors that underlie the evolution of major non-communicable diseases (e.g. cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases). Given that dopaminergic neurons of the mesocortico-limbic system are tightly associated with reward-related processes and motivation, their dysfunction may fundamentally influence behavior. While nicotine and alcohol alter dopamine neuron function by influencing some receptors, mesocortico-limbic system dysfunction was associated with elevation of metabolic set-point leading to hedonic over-eating. Although there is some empirical evidence, precise molecular mechanism for linking physical inactivity and mesocortico-limbic dysfunction per se seems to be missing; identification of which may contribute to higher success rates for interventions targeting lifestyle changes pertaining to physical activity. In the current article, we compile evidence in support of a link between exercise and the mesocortico-limbic system by elucidating interactions on the axis of muscle - irisin - brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) - and dopaminergic function of the midbrain. Irisin is a contraction-regulated myokine formed primarily in skeletal muscle but also in the brain. Irisin stirred considerable interest, when its ability to induce  of white adipose tissue parallel to increasing thermogenesis was discovered. Furthermore, it may also play a role in the regulation of behavior given it readily enters the central nervous system, where it induces BDNF expression in several brain areas linked to reward processing, e.g. the ventral tegmental area and the hippocampus. BDNF is a neurotropic factor that increases neuronal dopamine content, modulates dopamine release relevant for neuronal plasticity and increased neuronal survival as well as learning and memory. Further linking BDNF to dopaminergic function is BDNF's ability to activate tropomyosin-related kinase  receptor that shares signalization with presynaptic dopamine-3 receptors in the ventral tegmental area. Summarizing, we propose that the skeletal muscle derived irisin may be the link between physical activity and reward-related processes and motivation. Moreover alteration of this axis may contribute to sedentary lifestyle and subsequent non-communicable diseases. Preclinical and clinical experimental models to test this hypothesis are also proposed.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, we identified galactose as a limiting factor for the , and clarified the involvement of the Maillard reaction for the discoloration. A precursor of  of Cheddar cheese was isolated by procedures of solvent extraction and chromatography. D-Galactose and D-lactose were identified as a precursor of  of Cheddar cheese A and , respectively. Cheddar cheese (A, , and C), sugar-added cheese, and nine kinds of retail cheese were stored at 4 to 70ºC for 0 to 10 d, before the L*-, a*-, and *-values and sugar contents of each sample were measured. Cheese to which galactose was added turned brown more intensively during storage than the non-added control and the other sugar-added cheese. The more galactose was added, the more intensive the  of the cheese appeared. The decrease in galactose correlated with the ΔL*-, Δa*-, Δ*-, and ΔE-values indicating the  or discoloration of cheese samples. The decrease in sugars of nine kinds of retail cheese during storage also correlated with the ΔL*-, Δa*-, and ΔE-values of these cheese samples. These results clearly indicate that sugars, especially galactose, in cheese are an important factor for the  of cheese during storage. In general, a high amount of amino acids, peptides, and proteins exists in ripe or mature cheese. Therefore, sugars, especially galactose, were considered to be the limiting factor for the Maillard reaction causing the  of ripe or mature cheese during storage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27245969>Combined effect of blanching and sonication on quality parameters of bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) juice.</a></h2><p>This study evaluated the combined effect of blanching and sonication treatment on selected quality parameters of bottle gourd juice (BGJ). Bottle gourd cubes were blanched and juice was extracted. Effect of frequency (20-50kHz), amplitude (50-90%) and time (10-30min) was also studied on quality parameters like titratable acidity (TA), pH, total soluble solids (TSS), physical stability (PS), ascorbic acid (AA), total phenolics (TP), total carotenoids (TC),  index (BI), total plate count (TPC) and yeast & mold count (Y&M) of BGJ to derive the level of these parameters. Combined effect of blanching followed by sonication (BFS) showed significant (P⩽0.05) change in all quality parameters except TA. Highest percentage of TSS (5.9°), PS (2%), AA (18.99mg/100g), TP (1010mg/100g) and TC (5.8mg/100g) was observed at 70% amplitude, 50kHz frequency and 20min. Results suggested 70% amplitude, 50kHz frequency and 20min as best treatment conditions for processing of BGJ. Microstructure examination, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and laser diffraction analysis of BGJ showed significant change in particle size and distribution.

Cellular and secreted factors promote the inflammatory milieu of obesity, but the transcriptional pathways that drive these processes are not well described. Although the canonical inflammatory transcription factor NF-κ is considered to be the major driver of adipocyte inflammation, members of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family may also play a role in this process. Here, we determined that IRF3 expression is upregulated in the adipocytes of obese mice and humans. Signaling through TLR3 and TLR4, which lie upstream of IRF3, induced insulin resistance in murine adipocytes, while IRF3 knockdown prevented insulin resistance. Furthermore, improved insulin sensitivity in IRF3-deficient mice was associated with reductions in intra-adipose and systemic inflammation in the high fat-fed state, enhanced  of subcutaneous fat, and increased adipose expression of GLUT4. Taken together, the data indicate that IRF3 is a major transcriptional regulator of adipose inflammation and is involved in maintaining systemic glucose and energy homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29687585>Bone: Another potential target to treat, prevent and predict diabetes.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus is now a worldwide health problem with increasing prevalence. Mounting efforts have been made to treat, prevent and predict this chronic disease. In recent years, increasing evidence from mice and clinical studies suggests that bone-derived molecules modulate glucose metabolism. This review aims to summarize our current understanding of the interplay between bone and glucose metabolism and to highlight potential new means of therapeutic intervention. The first molecule recognized as a link between bone and glucose metabolism is osteocalcin (OCN), which functions in its active form, that is, undercarboxylated OCN (ucOC). ucOC acts in promoting insulin expression and secretion, facilitating insulin sensitivity, and favouring glucose and fatty acid uptake and utilization. A second bone-derived molecule, lipocalin2, functions in suppressing appetite in mice through its action on the hypothalamus. Osteocytes, the most abundant cells in bone matrix, are suggested to act on the  of white adipose tissue and energy expenditure through secretion of bone morphogenetic protein 7 and sclerostin. The involvement of bone resorption in glucose homeostasis has also been examined. However, there is evidence indicating the implication of the receptor activator of nuclear factor κ- ligand, neuropeptide Y, and other known and unidentified bone-derived factors that function in glucose homeostasis.

A challenge for this effort is the large number of new materials and their chemical diversity. Recent work suggests that many 2D materials will be thermodynamically unstable and thus non-persistent in biological environments. Such information could inform and accelerate safety assessment, but experimental data to confirm the thermodynamic predictions is lacking. Here we propose a framework for early hazard screening of nanosheet materials based on biodissolution studies in reactive media, specially chosen for each material to match chemically feasible degradation pathways. Simple dissolution and in vitro tests allow grouping of nanosheet materials into four classes: A, potentially biopersistent; : slowly degradable (>24-48 hours); C, biosoluble with potentially hazardous degradation products; and D, biosoluble with low-hazard degradation products. The proposed framework is demonstrated through an experimental case study on MoO nanoribbons, which have a dual 2D / 1D morphology and have been reported to be stable in aqueous stock solutions. The nanoribbons are shown to undergo rapid dissolution in biological simulant fluids and in cell culture, where they elicit no adverse responses up to 100μg ml dose. These results place MoO nanoribbons in Class D, and assigns them a low priority for further nanotoxicology testing. We anticipate use of this framework could accelerate the risk assessment for the large set of new powdered 2D nanosheet materials, and promote their safe design and commercialization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29660118>Effects of high-power ultrasound on microflora, enzymes and some quality attributes of a strawberry drink.</a></h2><p>The objective of the present work was to study the effect of high-power ultrasound (HPU) on the microflora, enzymes and some quality attributes of a strawberry drink and to provide a theoretical basis for strawberry drink processing conducive to the development of more nutritious and healthier strawberry drinks.Fresh strawberry drink was subjected to HPU treatment at 20 kHz (242, 605 and 968 W cm ) for 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 min in an ice bath.

The organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) resides along the rostral wall of the third ventricle, lacks a complete blood-brain barrier, and plays a pivotal role in body fluid homeostasis. Therefore, the present study used a multifaceted approach to examine whether OVLT neurons of Sprague-Dawley rats are intrinsically sensitive to changes in extracellular NaCl concentrations and mediate the sympathoexcitatory responses to central NaCl loading. Using in vitro whole-cell recordings, step-wise increases in extracellular NaCl concentrations (2.5-10 mmol/L) produced concentration-dependent excitation of OVLT neurons. Additionally, these excitatory responses were intrinsic to OVLT neurons because hypertonic NaCl evoked inward currents, despite pharmacological synaptic blockade. In vivo single-unit recordings demonstrate that the majority of OVLT neurons (72%, 13/19) display concentration-dependent increases in neuronal discharge to intracarotid (50 μL/15 s) or intracerebroventricular infusion (5 μL/10 minutes) of hypertonic NaCl. Microinjection of hypertonic NaCl (30 nL/60 s) into the OVLT, but not adjacent areas, increased lumbar SNA, adrenal SNA, and arterial blood pressure in a concentration-dependent manner. Renal SNA decreased and splanchnic SNA remained unaffected. Finally, local inhibition of OVLT neurons with the GABA receptor agonist muscimol (24 nL/10 s) significantly attenuated the sympathoexcitatory and pressor responses to intracerebroventricular infusion of 0.5 mol/L or 1.0 mol/L NaCl. Collectively, these findings indicate that OVLT neurons detect changes in extracellular NaCl concentrations to selectively alter SNA and raise arterial blood pressure.© 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174753>Changes in physicochemical properties of spray-dried camel milk powder over accelerated storage.</a></h2><p>Changes in physiochemical properties of spray-dried camel milk powders during storage at 11-32% RH and 37 °C over 18 weeks were investigated.

Maqui-dietary supplemented animals showed better insulin response and decreased weight gain but also a differential expression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, multilocular lipid droplet formation and thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT).

Overall, 96.8% of pathogens were susceptible to ampicillin plus a third-generation cephalosporin, 96.0% to ampicillin plus gentamicin, and 89.2% to third-generation cephalosporins alone.For most infants ≤60 days old evaluated in a pediatric emergency department for suspected invasive bacterial infection, the combination of ampicillin plus either gentamicin or a third-generation cephalosporin is an appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment regimen. Of the pathogens isolated from infants with invasive bacterial infection, 11% were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins alone.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Previously, an ethanolic extract of S. frutescens (SFE) has been shown to inhibit the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) by murine neurons and a microglia cell line (BV-2 cells). In this study we sought to confirm the anti-inflammatory activities of SFE on a widely used murine macrophage cell line (i.e., RAW 264.7 cells) and primary mouse macrophages. Furthermore, experiments were conducted to investigate the anti-inflammatory activity of the flavonol and cycloartanol glycosides found in high quantities in S. frutescens. While the SFE exhibited anti-inflammatory activities upon murine macrophages similar to that reported with the microglia cell line, this effect does not appear to be mediated by sutherlandiosides or sutherlandins. In contrast, chlorophyll in our extracts appeared to be partly responsible for some of the activity observed in our macrophage-dependent screening assay.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier .V.

Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 () are the commonest genetic cause of PAH, whereas biallelic mutations in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 gene () are described in pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Here, we determine the frequency of these mutations and define the genotype-phenotype characteristics in a large cohort of patients diagnosed clinically with PAH.Whole-genome sequencing was performed on DNA from patients with idiopathic and heritable PAH and with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis recruited to the National Institute of Health Research BioResource-Rare Diseases study. Heterozygous variants in  and biallelic  variants with a minor allele frequency of <1:10 000 in control data sets and predicted to be deleterious (by combined annotation-dependent depletion, PolyPhen-2, and  predictions) were identified as potentially causal. Phenotype data from the time of diagnosis were also captured.Eight hundred sixty-four patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH and 16 with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis were recruited. Mutations in  were identified in 130 patients (14.8%). Biallelic mutations in  were identified in 5 patients with a clinical diagnosis of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Furthermore, 9 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PAH carried biallelic  mutations. These patients had a reduced transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide (Kco; 33% [interquartile range, 30%-35%] predicted) and younger age at diagnosis (29 years; interquartile range, 23-38 years) and more interlobular septal thickening and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on computed tomography of the chest compared with patients with PAH without  mutations. However, radiological assessment alone could not accurately identify biallelic  mutation carriers. Patients with PAH with biallelic  mutations had a shorter survival.Biallelic  mutations are found in patients classified clinically as having idiopathic and heritable PAH. These patients cannot be identified reliably by computed tomography, but a low Kco and a young age at diagnosis suggests the underlying molecular diagnosis. Genetic testing can identify these misclassified patients, allowing appropriate management and early referral for lung transplantation.© 2017 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555811>Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 interacts with PGC1α and modulates thermogenic fat activation.</a></h2><p>Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) are enzymes that regulate the evolutionarily-conserved process of arginine methylation. It has been reported that PRMTs are involved in many metabolic regulatory pathways. However, until now, their roles in adipocyte function, especially  and thermogenesis, have not been evaluated. Even though Prmt1 adipocyte-specific deleted mice (Prmt1fl/flAQcre) appeared normal at basal level, following cold exposure or β-adrenergic stimulation, impaired induction of the thermogenic program was observed in both the interscapular brown adipose tissue and inguinal white adipose tissue of Prmt1fl/flAQcre mice compared to littermate controls. Different splicing variants of Prmt1 have been reported. Among them, PRMT1V1 and PRMT1V2 are well-conserved between humans and mice. Both variants contribute to the activation of thermogenic fat, with PRMT1V2 playing a more dominant role. Mechanistic studies using cultured murine and human adipocytes revealed that PRMT1V2 mediates thermogenic fat activation through PGC1α, a transcriptional coactivator that has been shown to play a key role in mitochondrial biogenesis. Our data are the first to demonstrate that PRMT1 plays a regulatory role in thermogenic fat function. These findings suggest that modulating PRMT1 activity may represent new avenues to regulate thermogenic fat and mediate energy homeostasis. This function is conserved in human primary adipocytes, suggesting that further investigation of this pathway may ultimately lead to therapeutic strategies against human obesity and associated metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608562>The Janus Face of Cereals: Wheat-Derived Prebiotics Counteract the Detrimental Effect of Gluten on Metabolic Homeostasis in Mice Fed a High Fat/High Sucrose Diet.</a></h2><p>Cereals are important sources of carbohydrates, but also contain nutrients that could impact adiposity. We analyzed the contribution of gluten on obesity and the effects of prebiotics -arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides (AXOS) and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS)- that can be extracted from gluten-containing cereals.Mice were fed a control diet, Western diet (WD, consisting of high fat/high sucrose), or WD with 5% gluten. Prebiotics were tested in the WD with gluten. Gluten did not increase body weight or intestinal permeability and had a minor effect on ileal inflammation. Gluten decreased the expression of  markers in the fat, and increased the triglycerides synthesis in the muscle. AXOS decreased body weight and adiposity in fat pads muscle and liver compared to the WD plus gluten. AXOS promoted gluten cleavage by the induction of prolyl endopeptidase that was translated into a reduction of gluten immunogenic peptides. Gluten had minor effects on cecal microbiota composition, whereas prebiotics increased Bifidobacterium, Butyricicoccus, Prevotella and Parasutterella, all negatively correlated to the cecal content of gluten peptides.While gluten may affect metabolic homeostasis, these effects are lessened when gluten is consumed along with cereal-derived fibers. If confirmed in humans, we bring new arguments to eat fiber-rich cereals to promote a healthy diet. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.This article is protected by copyright.

Beige adipocytes emerge from white adipose tissue (WAT) in response to chronic adrenergic stimulation. We investigated obesity-related changes in responses of both types of adipocytes to adrenergic stimulation in mice. Feeding of mice with high-fat diets (HFD: 45%-kcal fat) for 14 weeks resulted in significantly higher body and WAT weight compared to feeding with normal diets (ND: 10%-kcal fat). Injection with β3-adrenergic receptor agonist CL316,243 (CL; 0.1 mg/kg, once a day) for one week elevated the mRNA and protein expression levels of UCP1 in BAT, irrespective of diet. In WAT, CL-induced UCP1 expression in ND mice; however, the responses to CL treatment were attenuated in HFD mice, indicating that CL-induced  of WAT was impaired in obese mice. Flow cytometric analysis revealed a significant decrease in platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) α-expressing beige adipocyte progenitors in WAT of HFD mice compared with those of ND mice. Expression of PDGF-, a PDGFRα ligand, increased in WAT following CL-injection in ND mice, but not in HFD mice. Treatment of mice with a PDGFR inhibitor significantly decreased CL-dependent UCP1 protein induction in WAT. Our study demonstrates that β3-adrenergic stimulation-dependent beige adipocyte induction in WAT is impaired by obesity in mice, potentially due to obesity-dependent reduction in the number of PDGFRα-expressing progenitors and decreased PDGF- expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28636854>Cluster-Randomized, Crossover Trial of Head Positioning in Acute Stroke.</a></h2><p>The role of supine positioning after acute stroke in improving cerebral blood flow and the countervailing risk of aspiration pneumonia have led to variation in head positioning in clinical practice. We wanted to determine whether outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke could be improved by positioning the patient to be lying flat (i.e., fully supine with the back horizontal and the face upwards) during treatment to increase cerebral perfusion.In a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, crossover trial conducted in nine countries, we assigned 11,093 patients with acute stroke (85% of the strokes were ischemic) to receive care in either a lying-flat position or a sitting-up position with the head elevated to at least 30 degrees, according to the randomization assignment of the hospital to which they were admitted; the designated position was initiated soon after hospital admission and was maintained for 24 hours. The primary outcome was degree of disability at 90 days, as assessed with the use of the modified Rankin scale (scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability and a score of 6 indicating death).The median interval between the onset of stroke symptoms and the initiation of the assigned position was 14 hours (interquartile range, 5 to 35). Patients in the lying-flat group were less likely than patients in the sitting-up group to maintain the position for 24 hours (87% vs. 95%, P<0.001). In a proportional-odds model, there was no significant shift in the distribution of 90-day disability outcomes on the global modified Rankin scale between patients in the lying-flat group and patients in the sitting-up group (unadjusted odds ratio for a difference in the distribution of scores on the modified Rankin scale in the lying-flat group, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.92 to 1.10; P=0.84). Mortality within 90 days was 7.3% among the patients in the lying-flat group and 7.4% among the patients in the sitting-up group (P=0.83). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of serious adverse events, including pneumonia.Disability outcomes after acute stroke did not differ significantly between patients assigned to a lying-flat position for 24 hours and patients assigned to a sitting-up position with the head elevated to at least 30 degrees for 24 hours.

Here, we have investigated whether BAR502, a non-bile acid, steroidal dual ligand for FXR and GPBAR1, reverses steato-hepatitis in mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) and fructose. After 9 week, mice on HFD gained ≈30% of .w (P < 0.01 versus naïve) and were insulin resistant. These overweighting and insulin resistant mice were randomized to receive HFD or HFD in combination with BAR502. After 18 weeks, HFD mice developed NASH like features with severe steato-hepatitis and fibrosis, increased hepatic content of triacylglycerol and cholesterol and expression of SREPB1c, FAS, ApoC2, PPARα and γ, α-SMA, α1 collagen and MCP1 mRNAs. Treatment with BAR502 caused a ≈10% reduction of .w., increased insulin sensitivity and circulating levels of HDL, while reduced steatosis, inflammatory and fibrosis scores and liver expression of SREPB1c, FAS, PPARγ, CD36 and CYP7A1 mRNA.

Therefore, the long-term selected polygenic mouse line DUhTP originally established in Dummerstorf for high treadmill performance is used. DUhTP mice are characterized by increased fat accumulation in the sedentary condition and elevated fat mobilization during mild voluntary physical activity. In the present study, the phenotype of fat cell  of subcutaneous fat and a potential effect on oral glucose tolerance, an indicator of metabolic health, were addressed in DUhTP mice. Analysis of peripheral fat pads revealed increased brite (brown-in-white) subcutaneous adipose tissues and in subcutaneous fat from DUhTP mice higher levels of irisin and different markers of fat cell  like T-box transcription factor (Tbx1), PPARα, and uncoupling protein (UCP1) (P < 0.05) when compared to unselected controls. UCP1 was further increased in subcutaneous fat from DUhTP mice in response to mild exercise (fourfold, P < 0.05). In addition, surface temperature of DUhTP mice was increased when compared to controls indicating a physiological effect of increased UCP1 expression. The present study suggests that DUhTP mice exhibit different markers of mitochondrial biogenesis and fat  without external stimuli. At an age of 43 days, sedentary DUhTP mice have improved metabolic health as judged from lower levels of blood glucose after an oral glucose tolerance test. Consequently, the non-inbred mouse model DUhTP represents a novel model for the identification of fat cell  mechanisms in white adipose tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26604351>Influence of pin and hammer mill on grinding characteristics, thermal and antioxidant properties of coriander powder.</a></h2><p>In present study, influence of grinding (hammer and pin mills) and moisture content (range: 6.4-13.6 % dry basis) on the quality traits of coriander powder were investigated. These include grinding parameters, colour parameters, specific heat, thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, glass transition temperature, essential oil, total phenolic content, total flavonoid content and DPPH scavenging (%) of coriander powder. For coriander seed, the geometric properties such as major, medium, minor dimensions, geometric mean diameter, arithmetic mean diameter, sphericity, surface area and volume of coriander seeds increased significantly with increasing moisture (6.4-13.6 % db). For coriander powder, the grinding parameters such as average particle size, volume surface mean diameter and volume mean diameter increased significantly with increasing moisture (6.4-13.6 % db). With the grinding method, the colour attributes of coriander powder such as L-value, a-value, -value, hue angle and  index varied significantly. It was observed that the specific heat followed second order polynomial relationship with temperature and moisture whereas thermal conductivity varied linearly with temperature and moisture content. The variation of glass transition temperature with moisture can be best represented in quadratic manner. Total flavonoid content (mg QE/g crude seed extract) and DPPH scavenging % activity of coriander powder is significantly affected by grinding methods. A lower value of specific heat was observed for hammer ground coriander powder as compared to pin mill ground coriander powder. The thermal conductivity of hammer mill ground coriander powder was higher as compared to pin mill ground coriander. It was observed that hammer mill yields more fine coriander powder in comparison to pin mill. The  index was more in hammer mill ground coriander powder.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31476398>Synergistic effect of a novel chitosan/silica nanocomposites-based formulation against gray mold of table grapes and its possible mode of action.</a></h2><p>Ecofriendly nanostructured materials have been proposed as promising alternative control means to prevent plant diseases. Chitosan nanoparticles (CN), silica nanoparticles (SN) and chitosan-silica nanocomposites (CSN) were synthesized and their morphology and structure was characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), infrared spectra (FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopy. Their antifungal efficiency against Botrytis cinerea, the causal fungus of gray mold disease of table grapes, was tested in vitro and in vivo (under artificial and natural infections). In vitro tests showed that CN, SN and CSN reduced fungal growth by 72, 76 and 100%, respectively at 1% as compared to control. Under natural infection, at the end of cold storage, CSN was the most effective treatment, and reduced the development of gray mold by 59 and 83%, for 'Italia' and 'Benitaka' grapes, respectively as compared to the water control. Results indicate that a synergistic effect of CSN against gray mold was observed. The impact of tested nanocomposites on soluble solids - TSS, titratable acidity - TA, TSS/TA, berry color, mass loss, stem  and shattered berries was investigated. No negative effect of tested nanomaterials in term of grape quality was observed. For 'Italia' table grape, CN and CSN can preserve bunches from mass loss as compared to control. Also, the effect of CSN on reactive species of oxygen (ROS), ATP content and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) of . cinerea spores was determined to verify its mode of action. The obtained results suggested CSN, as alternative control means, to reduce/substitute the use of fungicides to control gray mold of table grapes while maintaining grape quality.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

However, the effects on reward processing potentially relevant to the treatment of anhedonia are less clear. Here we investigate the early and sustained effects of the dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor bupropion on behavioural measures of emotional and reward processing in currently depressed individuals. Forty-six currently depressed patients and 42 healthy controls participated in a repeated measures study, during which open-label bupropion was administered to only the patient group over a six week period without a placebo group. All participants completed the Emotional Test Battery and a probabilistic instrumental learning task at week 0, week 2 and week 6. Currently depressed patients displayed negative biases in emotional processing and blunted response bias for high-probability wins compared to the healthy controls at baseline. Bupropion was found to reduce the negative biases in emotional processing early in treatment, including a significant decrease in the percentage misclassification of other face emotions as sad and the number of negative self-referent words falsely recalled between baseline and week 2. Conversely, bupropion was found to initially further reduce the response bias for high-probability wins between baseline and week 2. This effect reversed with six weeks' bupropion treatment and reward processing was normalized compared to the healthy controls. Early in treatment, bupropion acts to reduce negative biases in emotional processing but exacerbates impaired reward processing. The beneficial actions of bupropion on reward processing then occur later in treatment. Such dissociation in the temporal effects of bupropion on emotional and reward processing has implications for the treatment of the different symptom domains of negative affect and anhedonia in depression.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Of mice and mental health: facilitating dialogue between basic and clinical neuroscientists'.© 2018 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29528125>Development of an orange juice beverage formulated with oat beta-glucan and whey protein isolate.</a></h2><p>A beverage was developed using beta-glucan and whey protein isolate (WPI).

Estrogen receptor α (ERα) is abundantly expressed in liver. However, whether FGF21 has a role in E2-induced white adipose tissue  remains uncertain. In this study, we showed that hepatic Fgf21 expression and secretion during estrus cycle changed with the tetradian oscillatory secretion of circulation E2 in adult, female mice, with their peak expressions and secretions at the proestrus. In addition, exogenous E2 robustly stimulated liver Fgf21 expression and elevated serum FGF21 concentrations, which induced  gene expression and reduced the tissue weight in subcutaneous white adipose in mice with ovariectomies. The inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and of ERα blocked the induction effect of E2 on the expression of Fgf21 in primary hepatocytes, which revealed that E2 might stimulate FGF21 expression via the ERα-mTOR pathway. Furthermore, FGF21 liver-specific deficiency abolished E2-induced white adipose  in mice with ovariectomies. This study indicates that ovarian E2 increased liver FGF21 expression directly, which in turn, functioned as an endocrine signal to influence inguinal white adipose tissue .-Hua, L., Zhuo, Y., Jiang, D., Li, J., Huang, X., Zhu, Y., Li, Z., Yan, L., Jin, C., Jiang, X., Che, L., Fang, Z., Lin, Y., Xu, S., Li, J., Feng, ., Wu, D.
