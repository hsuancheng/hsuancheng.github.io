While potent anti-HIV and antitumoral activities were attributed to BA, it is considered to have a moderate anti-inflammatory activity. Here we evaluated the effects of BA in a mouse model of endotoxic shock. Endotoxemia was induced through intraperitoneally LPS administration, nitric oxide (NO) and cytokines were assessed by Griess method and ELISA, respectively. Treatment of BALB/c mice with BA at 67 mg/kg caused a 100% survival against a lethal dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). BA treatment caused a reduction in TNF-α production induced by LPS but did not alter IL-6 production. Moreover, BA treatment increased significantly the serum levels of IL-10 compared to vehicle-treated, LPS-challenged mice. To investigate the role of IL-10 in BA-induced protection, wild-type and IL-10(-/-) mice were studied. In contrast to the observations in IL-10(+/+) mice, BA did not protect IL-10(-/-) mice against a lethal LPS challenge. Addition of BA inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by macrophages stimulated with LPS, while promoting a significant increase in IL-10 production. BA-treated peritoneal exudate macrophages produced lower concentrations of TNF-α and NO and higher concentrations of IL-10 upon LPS stimulation. Similarly, macrophages obtained from BA-treated mice produced less pro-inflammatory mediators and increased IL-10 when compared to non-stimulated macrophages obtained from vehicle-treated mice. In conclusion, we have shown that BA has a potent anti-inflammatory activity in vivo, protecting mice against LPS by modulating TNF-α production by macrophages in vivo through a mechanism dependent on IL-10.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here we investigated the immunomodulatory activity of eight semi-synthetic amide derivatives of . Screening of derivatives BA1-BA8 led to the identification of compounds with superior immunomodulatory activity than BA on activated macrophages and lymphocytes. BA5, the most potent derivative, inhibited nitric oxide and TNFα production in a concentration-dependent manner, and decreased NF-κB activation in Raw 264.7 cells. Additionally, BA5 inhibited the proliferation of activated lymphocytes and the secretion of IL-2, IL-4 IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A and IFNɣ, in a concentration-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis in lymphocyte cultures showed that treatment with BA5 induces cell cycle arrest in pre-G1 phase followed by cell death by apoptosis. Moreover, BA5 also inhibited the activity of calcineurin, an enzyme that plays a critical role in the progression of cell cycle and T lymphocyte activation. BA5 has a synergistic inhibitory effect with dexamethasone on lymphoproliferation, showing a promising profile for drug combination. Finally, we observed immunosuppressive effects of BA5 in vivo in mouse models of lethal endotoxemia and delayed type hypersensitivity. Our results reinforce the potential use of  and its derivatives in the search for potent immunomodulatory drugs.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p></html>
