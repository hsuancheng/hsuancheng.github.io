Reduced noradrenaline levels results in increased inflammation and neuronal damage. The primary source of noradrenaline in the central nervous system is tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)‑positive neurons, located in the locus coeruleus (LC). TH is the rate‑limiting enzyme for noradrenaline synthesis; therefore, regulation of TH protein expression and intrinsic enzyme activity represents the central means for controlling the synthesis of noradrenaline. Catalpol is an iridoid glycoside purified from Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch, which exerts a neuroprotective effect in multiple sclerosis (MS). The present study used an experimental mouse model of autoimmune encephalomyelitis to verify the neuroprotective effects of catalpol. Significant improvements in the clinical scores were observed in catalpol‑treated mice. Furthermore, catalpol increased TH expression and increased noradrenaline levels in the spinal cord. In primary cultures, catalpol exerted a neuroprotective effect in rat LC neurons by increasing the noradrenaline output. These results suggested that drugs targeting LC survival and function, including catalpol, may be able to benefit patients with MS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27732129>New pharmaceutical approaches for the treatment of food allergies.</a></h1><p>Allergic diseases constitute one of the most common causes of chronic illness in developed countries. The main mechanism determining allergy is an imbalance between Th1 and Th2 response towards Th2.This review describes the mechanisms underlying the natural tolerance to food components and the development of an allergic response in sensitized individuals. Furthermore, therapeutic approaches proposed to manage these abnormal immunologic responses food are also presented and discussed.In the past, management of food allergies has consisted of the education of patients to avoid the ingestion of the culprit food and to initiate the therapy (e.g. self-injectable epinephrine) in case of accidental ingestion. In recent years, sublingual/oral immunotherapies based on the continuous administration of small amounts of the allergen have been developed. However, the long periods of time needed to obtain significant desensitization and the generation of adverse effects, limit their use. In order to solve these drawbacks, strategies to induce tolerance are being studied, such as the use of either adjuvant  in order to facilitate the reversion of the Th2 response towards Th1 or the use of monoclonal antibodies to block the main immunogenic elements.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30624186>Who needs to carry an epinephrine autoinjector?</a></h1><p>Patients who have had anaphylaxis or who are at risk of it (eg, due to food allergy or Hymenoptera hypersensitivity) should carry an epinephrine autoinjector at all times.

In parallel, scientific interest also increased with the effort to explain the reasons of this sudden rise and to identify potential protective and risk factors. A great attention has been focused on early exposures to allergenic foods, as well as on other nutritional factors or supplements that may influence the immune system in a positive direction. Both interventions on maternal diet before birth or during breastfeeding and then directly on infant nutrition have been investigated. Furthermore, the natural history of food allergy also seems to be changing over time; IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy and egg allergy seem to be more frequently a persistent rather than a transient disease in childhood, as described in the last years. Food avoidance and the emergency drugs in case of an adverse event, such as epinephrine self-injector, are currently the first-line treatment in patients with food allergies, with a resulting impairment in the quality of life and social behaviour. During the last decade, oral  emerged as an optional treatment with remarkable results, offering a novel perspective in the treatment for and management of food allergy.© 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Whether increased circulating free fatty acids (FFA) owing to catecholamine-induced lipolysis affect myocardial energy metabolism and thus link hypoglycemia to cardiac vulnerability is unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of hypoglycemia counterregulation (± inhibition of lipolysis) on myocardial lipid content (MYCL) and left ventricular function in healthy subjects. Nine healthy men were studied in randomized order: 1) insulin/hypoglycemia test (IHT; ins+/aci-), 2) IHT during inhibition of adipose tissue lipolysis by acipimox (ins+/aci+), 3) normoglycemia with acipimox (ins-/aci+), and 4) normoglycemia with placebo (ins-/aci-). MYCL and cardiac function were assessed by employing magnetic resonance spectroscopy/imaging at baseline and at 2 and 6 h. In response to acute hypoglycemia, plasma FFA (P<0.0001) and ejection fraction (EF; from 63.2±5.5 to 69.6±6.3%, P=0.0001) increased significantly and were tightly correlated with each other (r=0.68, P=0.0002); this response was completely blunted by inhibition of adipose tissue lipolysis. In the presence of normoglycemia, inhibition of lipolysis was associated with a drop in EF (from 59.2±5.5 to 53.9±6.9%,P=0.005) and a significant decrease in plasma FFA, triglycerides, and MYCL (by 48.5%, P=0.0001). The present data indicate that an intact interorgan cross-talk between adipose tissue and the heart is a prerequisite for catecholamine-mediated myocardial contractility and preservation of myocardial lipid stores in response to acute hypoglycemia.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26301204> of Childhood Sarcomas.</a></h1><p>Pediatric sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of malignant tumors of bone and soft tissue origin. Although more than 100 different histologic subtypes have been described, the majority of pediatric cases belong to the Ewing's family of tumors, rhabdomyosarcoma and osteosarcoma. Most patients that present with localized stage are curable with surgery and/or chemotherapy; however, those with metastatic disease at diagnosis or those who experience a relapse continue to have a very poor prognosis. New therapies for these patients are urgently needed.  is an established treatment modality for both liquid and solid tumors, and in pediatrics, most notably for neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma. In the past, immunomodulatory agents such as interferon, interleukin-2, and liposomal-muramyl tripeptide phosphatidyl- have been tried, with some activity seen in subsets of patients; additionally, various cancer vaccines have been studied with possible benefit. Monoclonal antibody therapies against tumor antigens such as disialoganglioside GD2 or immune checkpoint targets such as CTLA-4 and PD-1 are being actively explored in pediatric sarcomas. Building on the success of adoptive T cell therapy for EBV-related lymphoma, strategies to redirect T cells using chimeric antigen receptors and bispecific antibodies are rapidly evolving with potential for the treatment of sarcomas. This review will focus on recent preclinical and clinical developments in targeted agents for pediatric sarcomas with emphasis on the immunobiology of immune checkpoints, immunoediting, tumor microenvironment, antibody engineering, cell engineering, and tumor vaccines. The future integration of antibody-based and cell-based therapies into an overall treatment strategy of sarcoma will be discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27505851>[Insect venom allergy – the diagnosis can be difficult to make but good treatment is available].</a></h1><p>Bee and wasp stings can cause allergic reactions. Although the local reactions are more frequent, anaphylaxis due to insect stings can be potentially fatal. Rapid recognition of anaphylaxis is therefore critical and reactions should immediately be treated with i.m. adrenaline. Patients having experienced anaphylaxis should be referred to an allergist for diagnostic evaluation and possible venom- (VIT). The clinical history is essential in diagnosis of venom allergy as the test results are not always reliable. Diagnostic testing with venom components might be beneficial in appropriate patients. The analysis of serum tryptase from the acute episode can be crucial. Mastocytosis is associated in about 8 percent of patients with severe anaphylaxis from insect stings and should be considered in the differential diagnosis.

Primary care providers encounter food-allergic children on a daily basis. Although the standard of care has traditionally been strict avoidance of the allergen and advisement to carry an epinephrine autoinjector in case of an accidental exposure resulting in a severe reaction, food allergy research has progressed in the past decade concerning various immunotherapies that may provide an alternate treatment strategy. Oral  (OIT), performed under the supervision of an allergist, is the most widely studied of these therapies. In the past, OIT has been available in the realm of clinical trials, but it is now being offered by a small but increasing number of allergists in private practice throughout the United States. Pediatric primary care clinicians should be aware of both the risks and possible benefits of this treatment, because they are likely to encounter patients who may inquire about OIT in their practices. In this case report, use of OIT will be reviewed in the treatment of a food-allergic child.Copyright © 2018 National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners. Published by Elsevier Inc.

PAFR activation not only induces acute proinflammatory responses, but it also induces delayed systemic immunosuppressive effects by modulating host immunity. Although enzymatic synthesis and degradation of PAF are tightly regulated, oxidative stressors, such as UVB, chemotherapy, and cigarette smoke, can generate PAF and PAF-like molecules in an unregulated fashion via the oxidation of membrane phospholipids. Recent studies have demonstrated the relevance of the mast cell (MC) PAFR in PAFR-induced systemic immunosuppression. The current study was designed to determine the exact mechanisms and mediators involved in MC PAFR-mediated systemic immunosuppression. By using a contact hypersensitivity model, the MC PAFR was not only found to be necessary, but also sufficient to mediate the immunosuppressive effects of systemic PAF. Furthermore, activation of the MC PAFR induces MC-derived histamine and PGE release. Importantly, PAFR-mediated systemic immunosuppression was defective in mice that lacked MCs, or in MC-deficient mice transplanted with histidine decarboxylase- or cyclooxygenase-2-deficient MCs. Lastly, it was found that PGs could modulate MC migration to draining lymph nodes. These results support the hypothesis that MC PAFR activation promotes the immunosuppressive effects of PAF in part through histamine- and PGE-dependent mechanisms.Copyright © 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29479349>Adrenergic Signaling: A Targetable Checkpoint Limiting Development of the Antitumor Immune Response.</a></h1><p>An immune response must be tightly controlled so that it will be commensurate with the level of response needed to protect the organism without damaging normal tissue. The roles of cytokines and chemokines in orchestrating these processes are well known, but although stress has long been thought to also affect immune responses, the underlying mechanisms were not as well understood. Recently, the role of nerves and, specifically, the sympathetic nervous system, in regulating immune responses is being revealed. Generally, an acute stress response is beneficial but chronic stress is detrimental because it suppresses the activities of effector immune cells while increasing the activities of immunosuppressive cells. In this review, we first discuss the underlying biology of adrenergic signaling in cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system. We then focus on the effects of chronic adrenergic stress in promoting tumor growth, giving examples of effects on tumor cells and immune cells, explaining the methods commonly used to induce stress in preclinical mouse models. We highlight how this relates to our observations that mandated housing conditions impose baseline chronic stress on mouse models, which is sufficient to cause chronic immunosuppression. This problem is not commonly recognized, but it has been shown to impact conclusions of several studies of mouse physiology and mouse models of disease. Moreover, the fact that preclinical mouse models are chronically immunosuppressed has critical ramifications for analysis of any experiments with an immune component. Our group has found that reducing adrenergic stress by housing mice at thermoneutrality or treating mice housed at cooler temperatures with β-blockers reverses immunosuppression and significantly improves responses to checkpoint inhibitor . These observations are clinically relevant because there are numerous retrospective epidemiological studies concluding that cancer patients who were taking β-blockers have better outcomes. Clinical trials testing whether β-blockers can be repurposed to improve the efficacy of traditional and immunotherapies in patients are on the horizon.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29676439>Oral and sublingual  for egg allergy.</a></h1><p>Clinical egg allergy is a common food allergy. Current management relies upon strict allergen avoidance. Oral  might be an optional treatment, through desensitization to egg allergen.To determine the efficacy and safety of oral and sublingual  in children and adults with immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated egg allergy as compared to a placebo treatment or an avoidance strategy.We searched 13 databases for journal articles, conference proceedings, theses and trials registers using a combination of subject headings and text words (last search 31 March 2017).We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral  or sublingual  administered by any protocol with placebo or an elimination diet. Participants were children or adults with clinical egg allergy.We retrieved 97 studies from the electronic searches. We selected studies, extracted data and assessed the methodological quality. We attempted to contact the study investigators to obtain the unpublished data, wherever possible. We used the I² statistic to assess statistical heterogeneity. We estimated a pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome using a Mantel-Haenzel fixed-effect model if statistical heterogeneity was low (I² value less than 50%). We rated the quality of evidence for all outcomes using GRADE.We included 10 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria, that involved a total of 439 children (oral  249; control intervention 190), aged 1 year to 18 years. Each study used a different oral  protocol; none used sublingual . Three studies used placebo and seven used an egg avoidance diet as the control. Primary outcomes were: an increased amount of egg that can be ingested and tolerated without adverse events while receiving allergen-specific oral  or sublingual , compared to control; and a complete recovery from egg allergy after completion of oral  or sublingual , compared to control. Most children (82%) in the oral  group could ingest a partial serving of egg (1 g to 7.5 g) compared to 10% of control group children (RR 7.48, 95% CI 4.91 to 11.38; RD 0.73, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.80). Fewer than half (45%) of children receiving oral  were able to tolerate a full serving of egg compared to 10% of the control group (RR 4.25, 95% CI 2.77 to 6.53; RD 0.35, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.43). All 10 trials reported numbers of children with serious adverse events (SAEs) and numbers of children with mild-to-severe adverse events. SAEs requiring epinephrine/adrenaline presented in 21/249 (8.4%) of children in the oral  group, and none in the control group. Mild-to-severe adverse events were frequent; 75% of children presented mild-to-severe adverse events during oral  treatment versus 6.8% of the control group (RR 8.35, 95% CI 5.31 to 13.12). Of note, seven studies used an egg avoidance diet as the control. Adverse events occurred in 4.2% of children, which may relate to accidental ingestion of egg-containing food. Three studies used a placebo control with adverse events present in 2.6% of children. Overall, there was inconsistent methodological rigour in the trials. All studies enrolled small numbers of children and used different methods to provide oral . Eight included studies were judged to be at high risk of bias in at least one domain. Furthermore, the quality of evidence was judged to be low due to small numbers of participants and events, and possible biases.Frequent and increasing exposure to egg over one to two years in people who are allergic to egg builds tolerance, with almost everyone becoming more tolerant compared with a minority in the control group and almost half of people being totally tolerant of egg by the end of treatment compared with 1 in 10 people who avoid egg. However, nearly all who received treatment experienced adverse events, mainly allergy-related. We found that 1 in 12 children had serious allergic reactions requiring adrenaline, and some people gave up oral . It appears that oral  for egg allergy is effective, but confidence in the trade-off between benefits and harms is low; because there was a small number of trials with few participants, and methodological problems with some trials.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27545732>Insect Allergy.</a></h1><p>Insect bites and stings are common.

However, its effectiveness in clinical settings is often hampered by various mechanisms. Previous studies have demonstrated that prooxidative stressor-mediated generation of oxidized lipids with platelet-activating factor-receptor (PAF-R) agonistic activity induces systemic immunosuppression that augments the growth of experimental melanoma tumors. We have recently shown that treatment of murine B16F10 melanoma cells in vitro or tumors implanted into syngeneic mice and treated intratumorally with various chemotherapeutic agents generated PAF-R agonists in a process blocked by antioxidants. Notably, these intratumoral chemotherapy-generated PAF-R agonists augmented the growth of secondary (untreated) tumors in a PAF-R dependent manner. As both localized and systemic chemotherapies are used based on tumor localization/stage and metastases, the current studies were sought to determine effects of PAF-R agonists on systemic chemotherapy against experimental melanoma. Here, we show that systemic chemotherapy with etoposide (ETOP) attenuates the growth of melanoma tumors when given subsequent to the tumor cell implantation. Importantly, this ETOP-mediated suppression of melanoma tumor growth was blocked by exogenous administration of a PAF-R agonist, CPAF. These findings indicate that PAF-R agonists not only negatively affect the ability of localized chemotherapy but also compromise the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy against murine melanoma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29219793>[Hypersensitivity reactions and vaccines].</a></h1><p>- A lot of questions are being asked in the Netherlands about the safety of vaccination.

The implication of missing YJ allergy is illustrated by a case of fatal anaphylaxis.To explore the natural course of YJ venom allergy and the diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic consequence of YJ venom sIgE in patients with ISM.All patients with ISM seen from 1981 to 2015 (n = 243) were evaluated on the number of YJ stings, reaction severity, and sensitivity and specificity of YJ venom sIgE. YJ venom allergic patients without mastocytosis served as control (n = 313).A total of 153 patients with ISM were stung during adult life. The first systemic reaction was more often severe in patients with ISM than in patients without mastocytosis (69.9% vs 22.0%) and reactions recurred in 40 of 41 re-stung patients with ISM. ISM reactors showed lower YJ venom sIgE levels than nonmastocytosis reactors (0.61 vs 4.83 kU/L; P < .001) and asymptomatic sensitization was exceedingly rare. In ISM the current clinical threshold of 0.35 kU/L yields a sensitivity and specificity of 77.6% and 87.5%, respectively. The optimal diagnostic accuracy is achieved at 0.17 kU/L (sensitivity, 83.6%; specificity, 85.0%).The high rate of severe reactions and the fatal case underscore the importance of adequate diagnostic sensitivity of sIgE in patients with ISM. The sensitivity of sIgE can be ameliorated by lowering the threshold to 0.17 kU/L, retaining good specificity. We recommend sIgE screening in all patients with ISM and discussing  when YJ venom sIgE exceeds 0.17 kU/L.Copyright © 2017 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Anaphylaxis at age 16 years was defined per NIAID/FAAN criteria. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to 14 common food and inhalant allergens were analysed at ages 4 (n = 2283) and 16 years (n = 2510). Among adolescents with food-related symptoms (FRS) and for whom blood was available (n = 221), 25 additional food allergen extracts or allergen components were analysed. Associations between reactions to foods, and sensitization and allergic multimorbidity were investigated.In the 12 months prior to the 16-year assessment, 8.5% of adolescents had FRS. This included 0.8% (n = 24) adolescents who were classified as having anaphylaxis, yielding an incidence rate of 761/100 000 person-years. One-third of adolescents accessed health care during anaphylaxis. Allergic multimorbidity in infancy, as well as sensitization to foods and airborne allergens at age 4 years, was associated with an increased risk for FRS in adolescence. Peanuts and tree nuts were the most common culprit foods for anaphylaxis, and fruits and vegetables for non-anaphylactic reactions. Adolescents with anaphylaxis were significantly more likely to be sensitized to storage proteins (Ara h 2, Cor a 9, Cor a 14) and to be polysensitized to foods (P < 0.001 vs. non-anaphylactic reactions).The incidence of food-induced anaphylaxis during adolescence in our population-based birth cohort is higher than previously reported. Adolescents with anaphylaxis differ from adolescents with non-anaphylactic FRS with regard to culprit foods and sensitization. Adolescents with previous anaphylaxis are likely to be polysensitized to foods, particularly tree nut and peanut storage proteins, and which warrants consideration at follow-up.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28698257>Brain Transforming Growth Factor-β Resists Hypertension Via Regulating Microglial Activation.</a></h1><p>Hypertension is the major risk factor for stroke. Recent work unveiled that hypertension is associated with chronic neuroinflammation; microglia are the major players in neuroinflammation, and the activated microglia elevate sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure. This study is to understand how brain homeostasis is kept from hypertensive disturbance and microglial activation at the onset of hypertension.Hypertension was induced by subcutaneous delivery of angiotensin II, and blood pressure was monitored in conscious animals. Microglial activity was analyzed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Antibody, pharmacological chemical, and recombinant cytokine were administered to the brain through intracerebroventricular infusion. Microglial depletion was performed by intracerebroventricular delivering diphtheria toxin to CD11b-diphtheria toxin receptor mice. Gene expression profile in sympathetic controlling nucleus was analyzed by customized qRT-PCR array.Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is constitutively expressed in the brains of normotensive mice. Removal of TGF-β or blocking its signaling before hypertension induction accelerated hypertension progression, whereas supplementation of TGF-β1 substantially suppressed neuroinflammation, kidney norepinephrine level, and blood pressure. By means of microglial depletion and adoptive transfer, we showed that the effects of TGF-β on hypertension are mediated through microglia. In contrast to the activated microglia in established hypertension, the resting microglia are immunosuppressive and important in maintaining neural homeostasis at the onset of hypertension. Further, we profiled the signature molecules of neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity associated with hypertension and TGF-β by qRT-PCR array.Our results identify that TGF-β-modulated microglia are critical to keeping brain homeostasis responding to hypertensive disturbance.© 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29134568>β2-adrenergic stimulation of dendritic cells favors IL-10 secretion by CD4 T cells.</a></h1><p>Adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists are extensively used as drugs in medicine for a broad spectrum of indications. We examined the consequences of β2-adrenergic stimulation of murine dendritic cells (DCs) on CD4 T cell activation. We demonstrated in vitro that treatment of LPS-matured DCs with the β2-agonist salbutamol reduced their ability to trigger OT-II T cell proliferation specific for ovalbumin antigen.

Co-culture of CD4 T cells with salbutamol-conditioned mature DC impaired TNFα and IL-6 secretion while preserving IL-10 production by T cells.

We included events that were considered likely related to OIT and identified potential baseline predictors of higher AE rates using generalized linear regression models.Eighty percent of subjects experienced likely related AEs during OIT (72% during buildup and 47% during maintenance). Of these AEs, over 90% occurred while at home. Approximately 42% of subjects experienced systemic reactions, and 49% experienced gastrointestinal symptoms. Twenty percent of subjects dropped out, with half (10% of the overall group) due to persistent gastrointestinal symptoms. Baseline allergic rhinitis (AR) and peanut SPT wheal size were significant predictors of higher overall AE rates. SPT wheal size predicted increased gastrointestinal AEs, and AR predicted increased systemic reactions. Over the course of OIT, 61% of subjects received treatment for likely related AEs, 59% with antihistamines and 12% with epinephrine.Peanut OIT is associated with frequent AEs, with rates declining over time, and most graded mild. However, systemic reactions and intolerable gastrointestinal AEs do occur and are significantly associated with AR and peanut SPT wheal size, respectively. Further study is needed of predictive biomarkers and the overall risks and benefits of OIT.Copyright © 2016 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Information on venom testing, severity of reaction to insect field sting, and SRs to VIT were retrieved.A total of 78 patients were included. Most had moderate to severe reactions to insect sting before VIT. The rate of SRs was 0.2% of injection visits, occurring in 9% of patients. The SRs from VIT were mild (mostly grade 1 and some grade 2), and no grades 3, 4, or 5 reactions were seen. Male sex was a significant risk factor for moderate to severe reactions to insect sting. Positive testing to vespinae was seen in 98.7% of patients, and none had exclusive sensitivity to honeybee. The severity of the initial, pre-VIT insect sting reactions in our patients did not correlate with the occurrence of SRs from VIT. Twenty-seven percent of the patients were subsequently stung while on VIT. Only 1 patient (5%) had a mild SR, while all others had only local or no reaction at all.In the largest US study evaluating the safety of VIT in children, SRs to VIT were mild, and none required epinephrine. Male sex was significantly associated with higher risk of moderate to severe reactions to insect sting. Larger multicenter studies are needed to further evaluate the rate of SRs to VIT in pediatric patients.Copyright © 2018 American College of Allergy, Asthma 8 Immunology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The association between immune and vascular function and the generation or progression of cardiovascular disease beg the question of whether altered immunity modifies pregnancy-induced changes in the vasculature. Our objective was to compare changes in the function and remodeling of systemic resistance vessels 4 weeks PP in normal C57BL/6 (B6), and immunodeficient mice recombinase 1-deficient/B6 ( Rag1). Immune deficiency did not change the responsiveness to acetylcholine (ACh) and phenylephrine at baseline but decreased arterial distensibility and increased stiffness PP. Adoptive transfer of CD8 T cells into Rag1 mice decreased the response to ACh while increasing distensibility and wall thickness. When compared to PP Rag1, vessels from PP CD4-deficient mice, which have B cells and CD8 T cells, but no CD4 cells, show increased distensibility and decreased responsiveness to ACh in a pattern similar to that seen in Rag1 given CD8 T cells prior to mating. These studies suggest a key role for T cell, particularly CD8 T cell, associated factors in the PP remodeling of maternal resistance vessels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27815065>Current Evidence on Safety and Practical Considerations for Administration of Sublingual Allergen  (SLIT) in the United States.</a></h1><p>Liquid sublingual allergen  (SLIT) has been used off-label for decades, and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved grass and ragweed SLIT tablets have been available in the United States since 2014. Potentially life-threatening events from SLIT do occur, although they appear to be very rare, especially for FDA-approved products. Practice guidelines that incorporate safety precautions regarding the use of SLIT in the United States are needed. This clinical commentary attempts to address unresolved issues including controversy regarding the FDA mandate for the prescription of epinephrine autoinjectors for patients on SLIT; how to approach polysensitized patients; optimal timing and duration of SLIT administration; how to address gaps in therapy; whether antihistamines can prevent local reactions, if certain patient populations (such as persistent asthmatics) should not receive SLIT; and when to instruct patients to self-administer epinephrine. Key points are that physicians should focus on educating patients regarding: (1) when not to administer SLIT; (2) how to recognize a potentially serious allergic reaction to SLIT; and (3) when to administer epinephrine and seek emergency care.Copyright © 2016 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

Variability in presentation can make differentiation between anaphylaxis and other AEFI difficult. This study summarizes pediatric anaphylaxis AEFI reported to an Australian state-based passive surveillance system.All suspected and reported pediatric (<18 years) anaphylaxis AEFI notified to SAEFVIC (Surveillance of Adverse Events Following Vaccination In the Community) Melbourne, Australia, between May 2007 to May 2013 were analyzed. Clinical descriptions of the AEFI, using the internationally recognized Brighton Collaboration case definition (BCCD) and final outcome were documented.93% (25/27) of AEFI classified as anaphylaxis met BCCD criteria, with 36% (9/25), assessed as the highest level of diagnostic certainty (Level 1). Median age was 4.7 years (range 0.3-16.2); 48% of cases were male. The vaccine antigens administered included: diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (DTaP) alone or in combination vaccines containing other antigens in 11 of 25 cases (44%); and live attenuated measles mumps rubella (MMR) vaccine for six (five also had other vaccines concomitantly administered). The estimated incidence rate of anaphylaxis for DTaP vaccines was 0.36 cases per 100,000 doses, and 1.25 per 100,000 doses for MMR vaccines. The majority of cases had rapid onset, but in 24% (6/25) of cases, first symptoms of anaphylaxis developed ≥30 min after immunization. In 60% (15/25) of cases, symptoms resolved ≤60 min of presentation. Intramuscular adrenaline was administered in 90% (18/25) of cases. All cases made a full recovery with no sequelae identified.This comprehensive case series of pediatric anaphylaxis as an AEFI identified that diagnostic criteria are useful when applied to a passive vaccine surveillance system when adequate clinical information is available. Anaphylaxis as an AEFI is rare and usually begins within 30 min of vaccination. However, healthcare professionals and vaccinees/parents should be aware that onset of anaphylaxis can be delayed beyond 30 min following immunization and that medical attention should be sought promptly if anaphylaxis is suspected.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Eight administrations were for grass SLIT-tablet-related adverse events (AEs): 4 for systemic allergic reactions and 4 for local mouth and/or throat swelling. In ragweed SLIT-tablet trials, epinephrine was used 9 times in 8 subjects (ragweed SLIT-tablet, n = 7; placebo, n = 1 [2 administrations for protracted anaphylaxis]). Four administrations were for ragweed SLIT-tablet-related AEs: 1 for systemic allergic reaction and 3 for local mouth and/or pharynx/throat swelling. In HDM SLIT-tablet trials, epinephrine was administered 13 times (HDM SLIT-tablet, n = 8; placebo, n = 5). Four administrations were for HDM SLIT-tablet-related AEs: 1 for systemic allergic reaction and 3 for local events. Of the 16 epinephrine administrations for events related to SLIT-tablet treatment, 11 occurred within the first week of treatment (7 administrations on day 1) and 5 were subject self-administered.Epinephrine administrations in response to SLIT-tablet-related reactions in clinical trials are uncommon, typically occur within the first week of treatment, and are rarely self-administered.

During the immunization, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was monitored using the tail cuff method. The vascular reactivity of immunized rats was assessed by ex vivo studies on SMA and TA using various β-AR agonists, phenylephrine and KCl.The immunizations producing functional β-ABs and β-ABs did not affect the SBP. However, in TA from β-AR-immunized rats, the relaxations mediated by dobutamine and salbutamol were significantly impaired in comparison with adjuvant rats whereas nebivolol-induced relaxation was not modified. Moreover, phenylephrine and KCl-mediated contractions were enhanced in these rats. In contrast, immunization with β-AR peptide led to the increase of relaxations induced by dobutamine in TA but did not change those induced by salbutamol and nebivolol. Surprisingly, in SMA from both rats immunized with β- or β-peptides, relaxations induced by the various β-agonists were not changed whereas phenylephrine and KCl-mediated contractions were impaired.Our study shows that β- and β-ABs can affect vascular reactivity. β-ABs would have a pathogenic action whereas β-ABs would have a beneficial effect on aorta reactivity.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We believe the implementation of a self-administration protocol characterized by patient preselection and a slow buildup phase is safe.We analyzed 23,614 patient records and associated  injections for systemic reactions (SR) during a 1-year period (2011 to 2012). SRs were graded in accordance with the World Allergy Organization (WAO) criteria.Thirty-seven SRs were reported for 23,614 patients who self-administered 2,021,600 injections yielding an annual SR rate of 0.16% (per patient) or 0.002% (per injection). Only 9 of 4643 pediatric (0.19%) and 28 of 18,971 adult patients (0.15%) experienced 1 or more SRs. No deaths (grade V SR) occurred. From 2009 through early 2014, over 90,000 patients received more than 10 million injections in accordance with the United Allergy Services (UAS) protocol without fatalities.We believe this safety profile is due to a preselection of patients to exclude those with a high risk for adverse reactions and a slow  buildup phase. In contrast, previous studies documented office-based SRs ranging from approximately 3% to greater than 14%. Thus, the UAS home- SR rate is significantly lower than office-based  SR rates (p < 0.0001). The enhanced safety of this protocol results in a decreased frequency and severity of SRs. This safety report, derived from analyses of one of the largest patient cohorts studied, corroborates and expands the observations of previous studies of self-administered subcutaneous  in a low-risk patient population by assessing self-administered allergen  during the buildup and maintenance phases.© 2014 ARS-AAOA, LLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25595251>Sepsis progression to multiple organ dysfunction in carotid chemo/baro-denervated rats treated with lipopolysaccharide.</a></h1><p>Sepsis progresses to multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) due to the uncontrolled release of inflammatory mediators. Carotid chemo/baro-receptors could play a protective role during sepsis. In anesthetized male rats, we measured cardiorespiratory variables and plasma TNF-α, glucocorticoids, epinephrine, and MOD marker levels 90min after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration in control (SHAM surgery) and bilateral carotid chemo/baro-denervated (BCN) rats. BCN prior to LPS blunted the tachypneic response and enhanced tachycardia and hypotension. BCN-LPS rats also showed blunted plasma glucocorticoid responses, boosted epinephrine and TNF-α responses, and earlier MOD onset with a lower survival time compared with SHAM-LPS rats. Consequently, the complete absence of carotid chemo/baro-sensory function modified the neural, endocrine and inflammatory responses to sepsis. Thus, carotid chemo/baro-receptors play a protective role in sepsis.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Almost everything.</a></h1><p>This review aims to describe current concepts in managing patients with food allergy. There have been many recent advances in the management of patients with IgE-mediated reactions to food, including diagnosis, prevention, management, and ongoing research in the field. Food allergy is increasing in prevalence and may be life threatening. This review aims to highlight changes in recommended practice when diagnosing and managing patients with food allergy.Early introduction of highly allergenic foods, particularly peanut, has been shown to decrease the risk for development of food allergy in patients who are at elevated risk. Avoidance of foods without a clinical history of food allergy may increase the risk of subsequent allergy. Epinephrine remains the first line therapy for anaphylaxis, and patients and families need to be instructed on indications and technique for use. Promising research is ongoing in areas of  to food allergens.Food allergy is a potentially life-threatening condition that may persist throughout adulthood.

Current management relies upon strict allergen avoidance. Oral  (OIT) might be an optional treatment, through desensitization to egg allergen.We aimed to assess the successful desensitization and development of tolerance to egg protein and the safety of egg oral and sublingual  in children and adults with immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated egg allergy as compared to a placebo treatment or an avoidance strategy.We searched 13 databases for journal articles, conference proceedings, theses and unpublished trials using a combination of subject headings and text words (the last search was on 5 December 2013).Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. All age groups with clinical egg allergy were to be included.We retrieved 83 studies from the electronic searches. We selected studies, extracted data and assessed the methodological quality. We attempted to contact the study investigators to obtain the unpublished data, wherever possible. We used the I² statistic to assess statistical heterogeneity. We estimated a pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome using a Mantel-Haenzel fixed-effect model if statistical heterogeneity was low (I² value less than 50%).We included four RCTs with a total of 167 recruited individuals (OIT 100; control 67 participants), all of whom were children (aged four to 15 years). One study used a placebo and three studies used an avoidance diet as the control. Each study used a different OIT protocol. Thirty nine per cent of OIT participants were able to tolerate a full serving of egg compared to 11.9% of the controls (RR 3.39, 95% CI 1.74 to 6.62). Forty per cent of OIT participants could ingest a partial serving of egg (1 g to 7.5 g; RR 5.73, 95% CI 3.13 to 10.50). Sixty nine per cent of the participants presented with mild-to-severe adverse effects (AEs) during OIT (RR 6.06, 95% CI 3.11 to 11.83). Five of the 100 participants receiving OIT required epinephrine. We cannot comment on whether over- or under-reporting of AEs was a concern based on the available data. Overall there was inconsistent methodological rigour in the trials.The studies were small and the quality of evidence was low. Current evidence suggests that OIT can desensitize a large number of egg-allergic patients, although it remains unknown whether long-term tolerance develops. A major difficulty of OIT is the frequency of AEs, though these are usually mild and self-limiting. The use of epinephrine while on OIT seems infrequent. There are no standardized protocols for OIT and guidelines would be required prior to incorporating desensitization into clinical practice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28065345>Is the Benefit From Prescribing Epinephrine Autoinjectors for Sublingual  Worth the Cost?

Herein, by using terbutaline mouse McAb as a model, a novel label-free strategy based on on-line microdialysis (MD) sampling combined with flow injection chemiluminescent detection was designed for measuring antibody affinity to hapten in a homogeneous system. After this McAb incubated with its hapten, the unbound hapten was sampled on-line by the MD probe and injected into the chemiluminescent detection system for quantification. The obtained concentrations of the unbound hapten were treated with Scatchard analysis and Klotz analysis to calculate the affinity constant. The MD probe showed a recovery of 26.2% for terbutaline under the chosen conditions. The affinity constants obtained using Scatchard analysis and Klotz analysis were 4.9×10M and 4.9×10M, respectively, showing negligible difference. The obtained affinity constants indicated that the investigated McAb was an antibody with medium affinity. The designed strategy provided a simple, rapid and low-cost approach for direct measurement of antibody affinity. Furthermore, it avoided the decrease of affinity, which was encountered frequently in the conventional approaches based on probe labeling of McAb and protein conjugation of hapten.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of α7 subtype (α7 nAChRs) regulate inflammatory processes in various tissues, including the brain. N-stearoylethanolamine (NSE) is a biologically active cell membrane component with anti-inflammatory and membrane-protective properties. Previously we found that mice injected with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or immunized with recombinant extracellular domain (1-208) of α7 nAChR subunit possessed decreased α7 nAChR levels, accumulated pathogenic amyloid-beta peptide Aβ(1-42) in the brain and demonstrated impaired episodic memory compared to non-treated mice. Here we studied the effect of NSE on behavior and brain components of LPS- treated or α7(1-208)-immunized mice. NSE, given per os, non-significantly decreased LPS-stimulated interleukin-6 elevation in the brain, slowed down the α7(1-208)-specific IgG antibody production and prevented the antibody penetration into the brain of mice. NSE prevented the loss of α7 nAChRs and accumulation of α7-bound Aβ(1-42) in the brain and brain mitochondria of LPS-treated or α7(1-208)-immunized mice and supported mitochondria resistance to apoptosis by attenuating Ca-stimulated cytochrome c release. Finally, NSE significantly improved episodic memory of mice impaired by either LPS treatment or immunization with α7(1-208). The results of our study demonstrate a therapeutic potential of NSE for prevention of cognitive disfunction caused by neuroinflammation or autoimmune reaction that allows suggesting this drug as a candidate for the treatment or prophylaxis of Alzheimer's pathology.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A number of challenges are encountered with epinephrine, resulting in underutilization and misutilization of epinephrine. The purpose of this study was to identify the scope of epinephrine pitfalls and opportunities for improvement in the management of allergy emergencies.A PubMed search from 1990 to 2015 was performed to identify all cases and reports pertaining to the use and misuse of epinephrine for anaphylaxis. Studies were assessed for obstacles or complications related to proper administration of epinephrine for treatment of allergic reactions, and were divided into problems originating with patients compared to healthcare providers.There were 1840 publications related to epinephrine use, of which 61 reports met inclusion criteria for pitfalls in the use of epinephrine. The most common problems reported related to lack of autoinjector availability (22), inadequate education of patients or providers (9), uncertainty about when or how to administer epinephrine (9), concern for systemic effects (13), failure to administer (8), and accidental administration (2). Responsibility for errors was divided among patients (18), providers (39), or both (4).Epinephrine is a potent medication with lifesaving indications and is the standard of care for treatment of anaphylaxis. The delivery of epinephrine in both trained and untrained populations carries certain pitfalls and complications that can have serious consequences. Identification of the scope of the problem is an important step in improving education for both providers and patients who are tasked with use of epinephrine for allergy emergencies.© 2016 ARS-AAOA, LLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28181151>Update on Potential Therapies for IgE-Mediated Food Allergy.</a></h1><p>Food allergy is common, affecting up to 8% of children in the USA.

This article reviews the published data on these new approaches.Oral , in which allergic subjects are exposed to increasing amounts of antigen, can be accomplished in the majority of allergic individuals. However, this approach is not a cure as most patients will react after cessation of regular intake. In addition, there is a high rate of side effects. Other approaches include epicutaneous , therapy with anti-IgE medications, and use of Chinese herbs. Several novel approaches on food allergy are under study.

Cytokine release induced by T-cell-activating therapeutic agents was also accompanied by a catecholamine surge and inhibition of catecholamine synthesis reduced cytokine release in vitro and in mice. Pharmacologic catecholamine blockade with metyrosine protected mice from lethal complications of CRS resulting from infections and various biotherapeutic agents including oncolytic bacteria, T-cell-targeting antibodies and CAR-T cells. Our study identifies catecholamines as an essential component of the cytokine release that can be modulated by specific blockers without impairing the therapeutic response.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25480332>Relaxant effect of superimposed length oscillation on sensitized airway smooth muscle.</a></h1><p>Asthma is associated with reductions in the airway lumen and breathing difficulties that are attributed to airway smooth muscles (ASM) hyperconstriction. Pharmaceutical bronchodilators such as salbutamol and isoproterenol are normally used to alleviate this constriction. Deep inspirations and tidal oscillations (TO) have also been reported to relax ASM in healthy airways with less response in asthmatics. Little information is available on the effect of other forms of oscillation on asthmatic airways. This study investigates the effect of length oscillations (LO), with amplitude 1 and 1.5% in the frequency range 5-20 Hz superimposed on breathing equivalent LO, on contracted ASM dissected from sensitized mice. These mice are believed to show some symptoms such as airway hyperreactivity similar to those associated with asthma in humans. In the frequency range used in this work, this study shows an increase in ASM relaxation of an average of 10% for 1.5% amplitude when compared with TO, ISO, or the combination of both. No similar finding is observed with 1% amplitude. This suggests that superimposed length oscillation acting over the interaction of myosin and actin during contraction may lead to temporal rearrangement and disturbance of the cross-bridge process in asthmatic airways.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27073146>Understanding the connection between platelet-activating factor, a UV-induced lipid mediator of inflammation, immune suppression and skin cancer.</a></h1><p>Lipid mediators of inflammation play important roles in several diseases including skin cancer, the most prevalent type of cancer found in the industrialized world. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a complete carcinogen and is the primary cause of skin cancer. UV radiation is also a potent immunosuppressive agent, and UV-induced immunosuppression is a well-known risk factor for skin cancer induction. An essential mediator in this process is the glyercophosphocholine 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine commonly referred to as platelet-activating factor (PAF). PAF is produced by keratinocytes in response to diverse stimuli and exerts its biological effects by binding to a single specific G-protein-coupled receptor (PAF-R) expressed on a variety of cells. This review will attempt to describe how this lipid mediator is involved in transmitting the immunosuppressive signal from the skin to the immune system, starting from its production by keratinocytes, to its role in activating mast cell migration in vivo, and to the mechanisms involved that ultimately lead to immune suppression. Recent findings related to its role in regulating DNA repair and activating epigenetic mechanisms, further pinpoint the importance of this bioactive lipid, which may serve as a critical molecular mediator that links the environment (UVB radiation) to the immune system and the epigenome.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Since PVG rats are not susceptible to arthritis induction, comparison of hypothalamic and peripheral neuro-endocrine and immune responses between immunized DA and PVG rats might help to explain their different susceptibility to develop the disease. PVG and DA rats were immunized with CII. Corticosterone, neurotransmitters, anti-CII antibodies, and cytokine concentrations in plasma, and hypothalamic neurotransmitters and cytokines were determined by ELISA, Luminex, HPLC and RT-qPCR. Adrenalectomy or sham-operation was performed in PVG and DA rats 14 days before immunization. Basal plasma corticosterone and adrenaline concentrations were significantly higher, and plasma cytokines and hypothalamic noradrenaline were lower in PVG rats than in DA rats. While DA rats developed severe arthritis upon immunization (maximum score 16), only 12 out of 28 PVG rats showed minimal symptoms (score 1-2). The density of sympathetic nerve fibers in arthritic joints of DA rats markedly decreased, but it remained stable in immunized PVG rats. The ratio corticosterone to IL-1β levels in plasma was markedly higher in immunized PVG rats than in arthritic DA rats. Adrenalectomy resulted in severe arthritis in PVG rats upon immunization with CII. While DA rats show an altered immune-brain communication that favors the development of arthritis, PVG rats express a protective neuro-endocrine milieu, particularly linked to the basal tone of the HPA axis. Mimicking disruption of this axis elicits arthritis in non-susceptible PVG rats.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Part II: impact of latent cytomegalovirus infection and catecholamine sensitivity.</a></h1><p>We showed previously that acute exercise is associated with a preferential redeployment of highly-differentiated NK-cells and increased cytotoxicity against HLA-expressing tumor cell lines during exercise recovery. In this part II study, we retrospectively analyzed these findings in the context of latent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and performed additional experiments to explore potential mechanisms underpinning the marked reduction in NK-cell redeployment with exercise in CMV-seropositive individuals. We show here that latent CMV infection impairs NK-cell mobilization with exercise, only when the intensity of the exercise bout exceeds the individual blood lactate threshold (BLT). This impaired mobilization is associated with increased proportions of poorly exercise-responsive NK-cell subsets (NKG2C+/KIR-, NKG2C+/NKG2A-, and NKG2C+/CD57+) and decreased NK-cell β(2)-adrenergic receptor (AR) expression in those with CMV. As a result, NK-cell production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in response to in vitro isoproterenol (synthetic β-agonist) stimulation was drastically lower in those with CMV (6.0 vs. 20.3pmol/mL, p<0.001) and correlated highly with the proportion of NKG2C+/CD57+ NK-cells (R(2)=0.97). Moreover, NK-cell cytotoxic activity (NKCA) against the K562 (36.6% vs. 22.7%, p<0.05), U266 (23.6% vs. 15.9%, p<0.05), and 221.AEH (41.3% vs. 13.3%, p<0.001) cell lines was increased at baseline in those infected with CMV; however, latent CMV infection abated the post-exercise increase in NKCA as a result of decreased NK-cell mobilization. Additionally, NKCA per cell against the U266 (0.24 vs. 0.12, p<0.01), RPMI-8226 (0.17 vs. 0.11, p<0.05), and 221.AEH (0.18 vs. 0.11, p<0.05) cell lines was increased 1h post-exercise (relative to baseline) in CMV-seronegative subjects, but not in those infected with CMV. Collectively, these data indicate that latent CMV infection may compromise NK-cell mediated immunosurveillance after acute exercise due to an increased proportion of "CMV-specific" NK-cell subsets with impaired β-adrenergic receptor signaling pathways.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The trial included 834 adults with HDM allergy-related asthma not well controlled by ICS or combination products, and with HDM allergy-related rhinitis. Key exclusion criteria were FEV1 less than 70% of predicted value or hospitalization due to asthma within 3 months before randomization. Efficacy was assessed during the last 6 months of the trial when ICS was reduced by 50% for 3 months and then completely withdrawn for 3 months.1:1:1 randomization to once-daily treatment with placebo (n = 277) or HDM SLIT tablet (dosage groups: 6 SQ-HDM [n = 275] or 12 SQ-HDM [n = 282]) in addition to ICS and the short-acting β2-agonist salbutamol.Primary outcome was time to first moderate or severe asthma exacerbation during the ICS reduction period. Secondary outcomes were deterioration in asthma symptoms, change in allergen-specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4), change in asthma control or asthma quality-of-life questionnaires, and adverse events.Among 834 randomized patients (mean age, 33 years [range, 17-83]; women, 48%), 693 completed the study. The 6 SQ-HDM and 12 SQ-HDM doses both significantly reduced the risk of a moderate or severe asthma exacerbation compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.72 [95% CI, 0.52-0.99] for the 6 SQ-HDM group, P = .045, and 0.69 [95% CI, 0.50-0.96] for the 12 SQ-HDM group, P = .03). The absolute risk differences based on the observed data (full analysis set) in the active groups vs the placebo group were 0.09 (95% CI, 0.01-0.15) for the 6 SQ-HDM group and 0.10 (95% CI, 0.02-0.16) for the 12 SQ-HDM group. There was no significant difference between the 2 active groups. Compared with placebo, there was a reduced risk of an exacerbation with deterioration in asthma symptoms (HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.49-1.02] for the 6 SQ-HDM group, P = .11, and 0.64 [95% CI, 0.42-0.96] for the 12 SQ-HDM group, P = .03) and a significant increase in allergen-specific IgG4. However, there was no significant difference for change in asthma control questionnaire or asthma quality-of-life questionnaire for either dose. There were no reports of severe systemic allergic reactions. The most frequent adverse events were mild to moderate oral pruritus (13% for the 6 SQ-HDM group, 20% for the 12 SQ-HDM group, and 3% for the placebo group), mouth edema, and throat irritation.Among adults with HDM allergy-related asthma not well controlled by ICS, the addition of HDM SLIT to maintenance medications improved time to first moderate or severe asthma exacerbation during ICS reduction, with an estimated absolute reduction at 6 months of 9 to 10 percentage points; the reduction was primarily due to an effect on moderate exacerbations. Treatment-related adverse events were common at both active doses.

Psychoactive drugs induce distinct stress hormone profiles, offering a sought-after opportunity to dissect the in vivo immunological effects of acute stress in humans.3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), methylphenidate (MPH), or both, were administered to healthy volunteers in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover-study. Lymphocyte subset frequencies, natural killer (NK) cell immune-phenotypes, and changes in effector function were assessed, and linked to stress hormone levels and expression of CD62L, CX3CR1, CD18, and stress hormone receptors on NK cells.MDMA/MPH > MDMA > MPH robustly induced an epinephrine-dominant stress response. Immunologically, rapid redistribution of peripheral blood lymphocyte-subsets towards phenotypically mature NK cells occurred. NK cytotoxicity was unaltered, but they expressed slightly reduced levels of the activating receptor NKG2D. Preferential circulation of mature NK cells was associated with high epinephrine receptor expression among this subset, as well as expression of integrin ligands previously linked to epinephrine-induced endothelial detachment.The acute epinephrine-induced stress response was characterized by rapid accumulation of mature and functional NK cells in the peripheral circulation.

This will end in the correct prescription of allergen  (AIT) for respiratory allergy and in adequate avoidance diets or prescription of self-injectable adrenaline in food allergy.The aim of this multicenter, real life study is to evaluate the percentage change of the diagnostic-therapeutic choice in polysensitized patients with respiratory allergy and in patients with food allergy, after using CRD compared to a first level diagnosis, along with an economic analysis of the patient's overall management according to the two different approaches.An overall number of 462 polysensitized patients, as suggested by skin prick tests (SPT), and with clinical symptoms related to a respiratory (275 pts) or food (187 pts) allergy, were recruited. All patients underwent CRD for specific IgE against food or inhalant recombinant molecules, which were chosen according to medical history and positivity to SPT. The first diagnostic-therapeutic hypothesis, based only on medical history and SPT, was recorded for each patient while the final diagnostic-therapeutic choice was based on the results from CRD. The rate of change of the diagnostic-therapeutic choice from the first hypothesis to the final choice was statistically evaluated. The economic impact of CRD on the overall management of the allergic patients was analyzed to evaluate whether the increase in the diagnostic costs would be compensated and eventually exceeded by savings coming from the improved diagnostic-therapeutic appropriateness.An approximate 50% change (k index 0.54) in the prescription of AIT for respiratory allergy as well as a change in the prescription of self-injectable adrenaline (k index 0.56) was measured; an overall saving of financial resources along with a higher diagnostic-therapeutic appropriateness was also detected.There is moderate agreement concerning prescription of AIT and self-injectable adrenaline before and after performing CRD: this highlights the usefulness of CRD, at least in polysensitized patients, in indicating the risk assessment and therefore the correct therapy of respiratory and food allergy, which results in a cost-saving approach.Copyright © 2018 SEICAP.

We aimed to assess the safety and protective efficacy of PfSPZ Vaccine against naturally acquired P falciparum in malaria-experienced adults in Mali.After an open-label dose-escalation study in a pilot safety cohort, we did a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial based in Donéguébougou and surrounding villages in Mali. We recruited 18-35-year-old healthy adults who were randomly assigned (1:1) in a double-blind manner, with stratification by village and block randomisation, to receive either five doses of 2·7 × 10 PfSPZ or normal saline at days 0, 28, 56, 84, and 140 during the dry season (January to July inclusive). Participants and investigators were masked to group assignments, which were unmasked at the final study visit, 6 months after receipt of the last vaccination. Participants received combined artemether and lumefantrine (four tablets, each containing 20 mg artemether and 120 mg lumefantrine, given twice per day over 3 days for a total of six doses) to eliminate P falciparum before the first and last vaccinations. We collected blood smears every 2 weeks and during any illness for 24 weeks after the fifth vaccination. The primary outcome was the safety and tolerability of the vaccine, assessed as local and systemic reactogenicity and adverse events. The sample size was calculated for the exploratory efficacy endpoint of time to first P falciparum infection beginning 28 days after the fifth vaccination. The safety analysis included all participants who received at least one dose of investigational product, whereas the efficacy analyses included only participants who received all five vaccinations.

We detected no significant differences in local or systemic adverse events or laboratory abnormalities between the PfSPZ Vaccine and placebo groups, and only grade 1 (mild) local or systemic adverse events occurred in both groups. The most common solicited systemic adverse event in the vaccine and placebo groups was headache (three [7%] people in the vaccine group vs four [9%] in the placebo group) followed by fatigue (one [2%] person in the placebo group), fever (one [2%] person in the placebo group), and myalgia (one [2%] person in each group). The exploratory efficacy analysis included 41 participants from the vaccine group and 40 from the placebo group.

In this review, we evaluate and summarize the literature specific to development and treatment of tree nut allergy. The cause of tree nut allergy, such as most food allergies, is unknown; there are theories regarding maternal dietary factors as well as sensitization related to cross-reactivity to peanut allergens. The gold standard for the diagnosis of tree nut allergy is the double-blind, placebo-controlled, oral food challenge; however, simpler and more cost-effective diagnostic methods, such as the skin prick test and serum-specific IgE are often used as a supplement for diagnosis. Management of tree nut allergy consists of dietary avoidance and using epinephrine to manage serious allergic reactions. Alternative therapeutic methods, such as oral and sublingual  and modification of allergenic proteins are being explored to develop safer, more effective and long-lasting management of tree nut allergy.

Here, we show that the anti-tumor immune response can be modulated by the brain's reward system, a key circuitry in emotional processes. Activation of the reward system in tumor-bearing mice (Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and B16 melanoma) using chemogenetics (DREADDs), resulted in reduced tumor weight. This effect was mediated via the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), manifested by an attenuated noradrenergic input to a major immunological site, the bone marrow. Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which develop in the bone marrow, became less immunosuppressive following reward system activation. By depleting or adoptively transferring the MDSCs, we demonstrated that these cells are both necessary and sufficient to mediate reward system effects on tumor growth. Given the central role of the reward system in positive emotions, these findings introduce a physiological mechanism whereby the patient's psychological state can impact anti-tumor immunity and cancer progression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26712521>Experience with epinephrine delivery in -associated systemic reactions.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26276085>Cardiac effects of long-term active immunization with the second extracellular loop of human β1- and/or β3-adrenoceptors in Lewis rats.</a></h1><p>β1- and β3-adrenoceptor (AR) auto-antibodies were detected in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.

The aims of this study were (1) to investigate, in isolated cardiomyocytes from rabbit, the role of Gi proteins in the β3-ABs-induced cardiac negative inotropy, (2) to determine whether β3-ABs may exhibit β3-AR antagonistic property which is characteristic of partial agonists, and (3) to determine whether long-term active immunization producing both β1-ABs and/or β3-ABs leads to the development of cardiac dysfunction in Lewis rats. Lewis rats were immunized for 6 months with peptidic sequences corresponding to the second extracellular loop of human β3-AR and/or β1-AR. Agonistic effect of β3-ABs was evaluated on electrically field-stimulated isolated cardiomyocytes from adult rabbit by measuring the cell shortening. Echocardiography and ex vivo isolated perfused heart studies were conducted on immunized rats. Finally, β-AR expression was quantified by immunofluorescence and RT-qPCR. SR58611A (10 nM), a preferential β3-AR agonist, and purified β3-ABs (25 μg/ml) induced a decrease in cell shortening (-39.71±4.9% (n=10) and -17.06±3.9% (n=10) respectively). This effect was significantly inhibited when the cardiomyocytes were preincubated with pertussis toxin (0.3 μg/ml), a Gi protein inhibitor (p<0.05). In addition, SR58611A-mediated negative inotropic effect was decreased when cardiomyocytes were preincubated with β3-ABs (p<0.0001). Echocardiography revealed a decrease in the fractional shortening and ejection fraction in rats immunized against β1-AR and both β1- and β3-AR. However, the study on isolated heart showed a decrease of the isoproterenol-induced lusitropic and inotropic effects in the 3 groups of immunized rats. These systolic and diastolic dysfunctions are correlated with a decrease in the expression of β1-ARs and an increase of β3-ARs in rats immunized against the β1-AR and an increase of both β3-AR and β1-AR in rats immunized against the β3-AR. For the first time, these results showed that β3-ABs had a β3-AR partial agonist-like activity which might play a role in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the effects of elevated norepinephrine and subsequent reactive oxygen species production in splenic T-lymphocytes during hypertension are not currently understood. We hypothesized that increased systemic levels of norepinephrine inhibits the activation of splenic T-lymphocytes via redox signaling. To address this hypothesis, we examined the status of T-lymphocyte activation in spleens of a mouse model of sympathoexcitation-driven hypertension (ie, norepinephrine infusion). Splenic T-lymphocytes from norepinephrine-infused mice demonstrated decreased proliferation accompanied by a reduction in interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor-α production as compared with T-lymphocytes from saline-infused mice. Additionally, norepinephrine directly inhibited splenic T-lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production ex vivo in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, norepinephrine caused an increase in G1 arrest in norepinephrine-treated T-lymphocytes, and this was accompanied by a decrease in pro-growth cyclin D3, E1, and E2 mRNA expression. Interestingly, norepinephrine caused an increase in cellular superoxide, which was shown to be partially causal to the inhibitory effects of norepinephrine, as antioxidant supplementation (ie, Tempol) to norepinephrine-infused mice moderately restored T-lymphocyte growth and proinflammatory cytokine production. Our findings indicate that suppression of splenic T-lymphocyte activation occurs in a norepinephrine-driven model of hypertension due to, at least in part, an increase in superoxide. We speculate that further understanding of how norepinephrine mediates its inhibitory effects on splenic T-lymphocytes may elucidate novel pathways for therapeutic mimicry to suppress T-lymphocyte-mediated inflammation in an array of diseases.© 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28562129>Fetal response to intramuscular epinephrine for anaphylaxis during maternal penicillin desensitization for secondary syphilis.</a></h1><p>Penicillin desensitization is indicated in pregnant patients with severe allergies to penicillin with syphilis.

In order to investigate adjuvant of thymosin α1-bursin-like peptide (Tα1-BLP), we cloned the gene of Tα1-BLP and provided evidence that the gene of Tα1-BLP in a recombinant prokaryotic expression plasmid was successfully expressed in E. coli BL21. To evaluate the immune adjuvant properties of Tα1-BLP, chickens were immunized with Tα1-BLP combined with H9N2 avian influenza whole-inactivated virus (WIV). The titers of HI antibody, antigen-specific antibodies, AIV-neutralizing antibodies, levels of Th1-type cytokines (IFN-γ) and Th2-type cytokines (IL-4) and lymphocyte proliferation responses were determined. What's more, the viral loads and pathologic changes of lung tissue were observed by virus challenge experiment and HE staining to evaluate the immune protection of chickens. We found that Tα1-BLP enhanced HI antibody and antigen-specific IgG antibodies titers, increased the level of AIV-neutralizing antibodies, induced the secretion of Th1- and Th2-type cytokines, and promoted the proliferation of T and B lymphocyte, Furthermore, virus challenge experiment and HE staining confirmed that Tα1-BLP contributed to inhibition replication of the virus from chicken lungs and protected the lungs from damage. Altogether, this study suggested that Tα1-BLP is a novel adjuvant suitable for H9N2 avian influenza vaccine.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Some studies suggest that hyperactivation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) may be the key factor underlying SIDS. Catecholamines impair early lymphocyte response, which can increase the risk of stroke-associated infection (SAI).Our study focused on dynamic changes of metanephrine (MN), normetanephrine (NMN), cytokines, and spleen volume in the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model.After MCAO, there is hyperactivation of SNS and pro-/anti-inflammatory imbalance, indicating systemic immunodepression. In addition, rat spleen size was reduced. Correlation analysis indicated that MCAO-induced spleen size reduction correlated with the changes in MN, NMN, and cytokines. Blocking SNS with propranolol can partly reverse the immunodepression and the reduction in spleen volume.Taken together, these findings suggest that acute ischemic stroke induces over-activation of the SNS, which lowers the threshold of infection and increases the risk of infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26027662>[Adrenaline and  in allergies against insect venom].</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29150280>NK cell recruitment and exercise: Potential immunotherapeutic role of shear stress and endothelial health.</a></h1><p>Positive cancer patient outcomes, including increased time to recurrent events, have been associated with increased counts and function of natural killer (NK) cells. NK cell counts and function are elevated following acute exercise, and the generally accepted mechanism of increased recruitment suggests that binding of epinephrine releases NK cells from endothelial tissue via decreases in adhesion molecules following. I propose that blood flow-induced shear stress may also play a role in NK cell recruitment from the endothelium. Additionally, shear stress may play a role in improving NK cell function by decreasing oxidative stress. The relationship between shear stress and NK cell count and function can be tested by utilizing exercise and local heating with cuff inflation. If shear stress does play an important role, NK cell count and function will be improved in the non-cuffed exercise group, but not the cuffed limb. This paper will explore the mechanisms potentially explaining exercise-induced improvements in NK cell count and function, and propose a model for investigating these mechanisms. This mechanistic insight could aid in providing a novel, safe, relatively inexpensive, and non-invasive target for  in cancer patients.Copyright © 2017.

Yet, a conventional mRNA vaccine comprising of condensed mRNA molecules in a positively charged protein core structure is not effectively internalized by the antigen-presenting cells. It cannot offer sufficient protection for mRNA molecules from degradation by plasma and tissue enzymes either. Here, we have developed a lipopolyplex mRNA vaccine that consists of a poly-(β-amino ester) polymer mRNA core encapsulated into a 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-ethylphosphocholine/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidyl-/1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino(polyethylene glycol)-2000 (EDOPC/DOPE/DSPE-PEG) lipid shell. This core-shell structured mRNA vaccine enters dendritic cells through macropinocytosis. It displayed intrinsic adjuvant activity by potently stimulating interferon-β and interleukin-12 expression in dendritic cells through Toll-like receptor 7/8 signaling. Dendritic cells treated with the mRNA vaccine displayed enhanced antigen presentation capability. Mice bearing lung metastatic B16-OVA tumors expressing the ovalbumin antigen were treated with the lipopolyplex mRNA, and over 90% reduction of tumor nodules was observed. Collectively, this core-shell structure offers a promising platform for mRNA vaccine development.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, high-risk patients (e.g., patients with a history of anaphylaxis or high antigen-specific immunoglobulin E [IgE] levels) must carefully undergo OFCs in hospitals. We attempted to identify the risk factors for severe symptoms during OFC testing among high-risk patients.We retrospectively evaluated patients' characteristics and severe symptoms that were experienced during a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge test performed before the patients underwent oral  between June 2008 and June 2012. Patients were ≥5 years old and had an anaphylactic history or antigen-specific IgE (>30 kUA/L). Severe symptoms were defined using the grading of the Japanese Anaphylaxis Guidelines, which are modified from the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology Guidelines.We evaluated 393 cases with positive test results, including 98 cases with severe symptoms. The most frequent severe symptoms were respiratory (77%), gastrointestinal (28%), cardiovascular (27%), and neurological (13%) symptoms. Multivariate analysis revealed that the significant factors for a severe reaction were a history of anaphylaxis to the causative food (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 2.147, p = 0.003), older age (per 1 year increase, adjusted OR: 1.102, p = 0.044), and an egg OFC (adjusted OR: 0.433, p = 0.003).The risk factors for a severe reaction to OFCs were a history of an anaphylactic reaction and older age. An egg OFC was associated with low risk of severe symptoms during OFC. Therefore, OFCs for patients with these risk factors should only be performed under specialist supervision with access to rapid treatment and full resuscitation equipment.© 2017 The Author(s) Published by S.

The objectives of this multicentre study were to assess the clinical relevance of cashew nut sensitisation, to study the clinical reaction patterns in double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge tests and to establish the amount of cashew nuts that can elicit an allergic reaction.A total of 179 children were included (median age 9.0 years; range 2-17 years) with cashew nut sensitisation and a clinical history of reactions to cashew nuts or unknown exposure. Sensitised children who could tolerate cashew nuts were excluded. The study included three clinical visits and a telephone consultation. During the first visit, the medical history was evaluated, physical examinations were conducted, blood samples were drawn and skin prick tests were performed. The children underwent a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge test with cashew nut during the second and third visits. The study showed that 137 (76.5%) of the sensitised children suspected of allergy to cashew nut had a positive double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge test, with 46% (63) manifesting subjective symptoms to the lowest dose of 1 mg cashew nut protein and 11% (15) developing objective symptoms to the lowest dose. Children most frequently had gastro-intestinal symptoms, followed by oral allergy and skin symptoms. A total of 36% (49/137) of the children experienced an anaphylactic reaction and 6% (8/137) of the children were treated with epinephrine.This prospective study demonstrated a strikingly high percentage of clinical reactions to cashew nut in this third line population. Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis requiring epinephrine, were observed.

Patients with immune disorders acquire infections that can be predicted by their immune dysfunction. Fungal infections are typically noted in neutropenic (congenital or acquired) and T-cell deficient individuals. Coexisting fungal infections are rare, even in hosts who are immunocompromised, and they require careful evaluation.

This review will discuss triggers and risk factors, clinical diagnosis, and management of anaphylaxis in the office setting.Anaphylaxis in the office setting is a medical emergency. It, therefore, is important to prepare for it, to have a posted, written anaphylaxis emergency protocol, and to rehearse the plan regularly. In this review, we presented the important steps in managing anaphylaxis in the office. Treatment of anaphylaxis should start with epinephrine administered intramuscularly at the first sign of anaphylaxis. Oxygen and intravenous fluids may be needed for moderate-to-severe anaphylaxis or anaphylaxis that is quickly developing or if the patient is unresponsive to the first injection of epinephrine. Antihistamine therapy is considered adjunctive to epinephrine, which mainly relieves itching and urticaria. Corticosteroids, with an onset of action of 4-6 hours, have no immediate effect on anaphylaxis.To prevent near-fatal and fatal reactions from anaphylaxis, the patient, the family, and the physician must remember to follow the necessary steps when treating anaphylaxis. In anaphylaxis, there is no absolute contraindication for epinephrine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27618651>Fetal brain lesions after subcutaneous inoculation of Zika virus in a pregnant nonhuman primate.</a></h1><p>We describe the development of fetal brain lesions after Zika virus (ZIKV) inoculation in a pregnant pigtail macaque.

AANAT is the core enzyme in melatonin production; because melatonin participates in many physiological processes, the regulation of AANAT is an important research topic. In this study, we focused on the role of heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein R (hnRNP R) in the translation of AANAT. A novel RNA-binding protein hnRNP R widely interacted with the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of AANAT mRNA and contributed to translation through an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). Fine-tuning of AANAT protein synthesis occurred in response to knockdown and overexpression of hnRNP R. Nocturnal elevation of AANAT protein was dependent on the rhythmic changes of hnRNP R, whose levels are elevated in the pineal gland during nighttime. Increases in hnRNP R additionally improved AANAT production in rat pinealocytes under norepinephrine (NE) treatment. These results suggest that cap-independent translation of AANAT mRNA plays a role in the rhythmic synthesis of melatonin through the recruitment of translational machinery to hnRNP R-bound AANAT mRNA.© 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Significant advances have been made in food allergy oral , which is emerging as a potential preventive and curative treatment for this disease. The fundamental strategy of oral  is to mitigate adverse immune responses to allergenic food proteins through repeated exposure; reduced reactivity to food allergens (desensitization) often results, but the establishment of sustained immune unresponsiveness or of permanent resolution (tolerance) is not certain.

They originate from glial cells which infiltrate throughout the brain. Current standard of care involves surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy; median survival is currently ~14-20 months postdiagnosis. Given that the brain immune system is deficient in priming systemic immune responses to glioma antigens, we proposed to reconstitute the brain immune system to achieve immunological priming from within the brain. Two adenoviral vectors are injected into the resection cavity or remaining tumor. One adenoviral vector expresses the HSV-1-derived thymidine kinase which converts ganciclovir into a compound only cytotoxic to dividing glioma cells. The second adenovirus expresses the cytokine fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L). Flt3L differentiates precursors into dendritic cells and acts as a chemokine that attracts dendritic cells to the brain. HSV-1/ganciclovir killing of tumor cells releases tumor antigens that are taken up by dendritic cells within the brain tumor microenvironment. Tumor killing also releases HMGB1, an endogenous TLR2 agonist that activates dendritic cells. HMGB1-activated dendritic cells, loaded with glioma antigens, migrate to cervical lymph nodes to stimulate a systemic CD8+ T cells cytotoxic immune response against glioma. This immune response is specific to glioma tumors, induces immunological memory, and does neither cause brain toxicity nor autoimmune responses. An IND was granted by the FDA on 4/7/2011. A Phase I, first in person trial, to test whether reengineering the brain immune system is potentially therapeutic is ongoing.© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Since inception of SCIT, systemic allergic reactions (SRs) and severe anaphylaxis have been risk management challenges facing the practicing allergist. Recently it has estimated that 14% of reported SRs begin at least 30 minutes after injection administration or after the 30 minute recommended clinic observation period. Faced with the possibility that SRs could occur after the patient leaves the clinic, some practicing allergists routinely prescribe epinephrine auto-injectors to all injection patients. This article summarizes the key arguments for and against routine prescription of epinephrine auto-injectors for all allergen injection patients, discussed in a PRO/CON debate at the 2015 AAAAI meeting. Currently, there is insufficient clinical evidence to make a strong recommendation for or against this practice.Copyright © 2016 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.
