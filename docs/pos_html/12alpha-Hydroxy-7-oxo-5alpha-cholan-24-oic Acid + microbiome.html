The results showed that the  decrease rates of BBP, BBP-8, BBP-16, and BBP-24 were 77.48, 69.61, 56.87, and 52.89%, respectively. The antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of BBPs were decreased under gastrointestinal condition, which might be due to the variation of  during digestion. The bile -binding ability of BBPs showed an -dependent manner for higher  polysaccharides with higher viscosity. Through fermentation, the BBPs affected the ecosystem of the intestinal tract by promoting the production of short-chain fatty , lowering the pH of colon, and decreasing the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. All BBPs showed almost a similar modulation effect on the gut bacteria, but the lower  polysaccharide was more easily utilized by bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667426>Oregano: A potential prophylactic treatment for the intestinal .</a></h2><p>Prophylactic use of antibiotics in poultry diets has been identified as a problematic practice because of its potential to exacerbate the spread of antibiotic resistance to human pathogens. A range of countries have opted to completely ban the use of antibiotics in animal feed. The animal production industries are looking for alternative ways to effectively control pathogens while providing the performance benefits previously secured by antibiotics in feed. Here, we present evidence that oregano () could be a potential alternative for pathogen control in the poultry industry. Broiler diets were supplemented with oregano powder (0%, 0.5%, 1%, and 2%) for six weeks. The capacity for pathogen control was estimated by  profiling of the jejunum, ileum, and caecum content, and in the faeces, by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The concentrations of short-chain fatty  in the caecal content were also measured, as were villus/crypt parameters in the ileum. There were no differences among treatments in weight gain, feed intake, or the concentration of short-chain fatty . The height, width, and the surface area of villi in the ileum were not influenced by oregano addition. However, 1% and 2% of oregano produced a significant increase in the villus height to crypt depth ratio. There were no visible histopathological changes in the liver in control and treated groups. Although oregano had no significant effect on overall microbial diversity and gross composition, some specific genera, like ,  and , which include known pathogens, were reduced in relative abundance by oregano treatment. , recognized as a beneficial and probiotic genus, was also suppressed by the oregano treatment.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590758>Impact of dietary ingredients on the interpretation of various fecal parameters in rats fed inulin.</a></h2><p>In the present study, the influences of diets (i.e. chow and AIN-93 diets) on the interpretation of various fecal parameters including viable , moisture, weight, and short-chain fatty  in rats fed different amounts of inulin (0.5-2 g/kg). Eight groups of rats (n = 8/group) were fed, for 4 weeks, chow or AIN-93 diets with or without inulin supplementation. Fecal samples were analyzed for different fecal parameters. After a 2-week adaptation, apparent differences in some fecal parameters were observed between the chow and AIN-93 diet groups. Throughout the 4-week intervention period, significantly (p < 0.05) higher Lactobacillus spp. counts, fecal moisture (∼2.7-fold), and fecal weight (∼5.8-fold) were observed with chow diet over AIN-93 diet. More specifically, significant elevations in the levels of Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., fecal moisture, and fecal weight could be observed at low-dose (0.5 g/kg) of inulin in chow diet groups, while most of these changes could merely be seen at medium-dose (1 g/kg) in AIN-93 diet groups. These results demonstrated that the choice of experimental diets would affect the comparison of fecal parameters as well as the interpretation of effective dosage of prebiotic in intestinal health assessments.Copyright © 2019.

Hence, there is a need to strictly examine the biosafety as well as health benefits of probiotics in vivo model system.In this study, two lactic  bacterial (LAB) cultures Lactobacillus fermentum NCMR 2826 and FIX proven for their in vitro probiotic properties were investigated for their in vivo safety in Wistar rats. Acute toxicity study (14 days) with high dose of biomass (10  CFU/mL), followed by sub-chronic test for 13 weeks with oral feeding of the probiotic cultures in three different doses viz; 10, 10 and 10  CFU/mL on daily basis revealed the safety of the L. fermentum cultures. The probiotic feeding had no toxic effects on the survival, body weight, food consumption, with either of the dosage used throughout the treatment period. No statistically significant changes in relative organ weight, serum biochemical and hematological indices were found among the control and the probiotic fed animals. In addition to the safety attributes, the two L. fermentum cultures fed rats showed reduced serum cholesterol levels, macrovesicular steatosis and hepatocyte ballooning compared to control animals. Further, quantification of intestinal  using real-time PCR analysis from animal feces indicated a significant increase and stability of Lactobacillus and bifidobacterial counts but a decrease of E. coli numbers.This study of safety and beneficial features highlight the use of the two native L. fermentum isolates as potential probiotic food supplements.

Previous in vitro studies about biological effects of TCC have yielded a variety of inconsistent results and apparently not been verified in vivo. In the current study, dose-dependent effects of TCC exposure on lipid homeostasis in rats were investigated using a combination of untargeted H NMR metabolomics, targeted metabolite profiling (LC/GC-MS), histopathological assessments, and biological assays. Our results revealed that TCC dose-dependently activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and its transcriptional targets such as  and  in the liver of rats, suggesting that TCC may be a potent AHR agonist. Although TCC exhibited dose-dependent toxicity, oral exposure with relatively low dose TCC caused more significant hepatic lipogenesis of rats than relatively high and moderate doses of TCC. It was mainly manifested by histopathological observations and promotion of de novo fatty , phospholipid, and ceramide biosynthesis and gut  fermentation. Our findings provide new insights into health effects of TCC exposure with different dosages in vivo, especially on the induction and progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and further our understanding in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases induced by environmental pollutants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576430>Adhesion mechanisms of lactic  bacteria: conventional and novel approaches for testing.</a></h2><p>Adhesion ability is a primary criterion for the selection of probiotic microorganisms. Lactic  bacteria contribute the majority of microorganisms with probiotic properties. They have several important mechanisms for intestinal epithelial cell adhesion. In order to adhere to the intestinal cells, they generally use various structures such as flagella, pili, S layer proteins, lipoteichoic , exopolysaccharides and mucus binding proteins. Various in vitro experiments were designed or study models were developed to reveal the mechanisms they utilize for binding to the intestinal cells, yet, the mechanisms for their adhesion are not fully explained. The major disadvantage of conventional models is the lack of layers forming the intestinal mucosa. Besides, these models omit the presence of natural , digestive conditions and the presence of a food matrix. Because of the disadvantages of existing models, natural tissues or novel applications like 3D organ cultures, which are better able to mimic in vivo conditions, are preferred.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649644>Caecal  of Experimentally Infected Chickens at Different Ages.</a></h2><p> is the most common bacterial cause of foodborne zoonosis in the European Union. Infections are often linked to the consumption and handling of poultry meat. The aim of the present study was to investigate the caecal  of birds infected with  at different ages. Therefore, a total of 180 birds of the laying hybrid Lohmann Brown-Classic were housed in 12 subgroups of 15 animals each in three performed repetitions. Three birds per subgroup were experimentally infected with  at an age of about 21 days and about 78 days (4.46 ± 0.35 log CFU/bird). Twenty-one days after experimental infection,  studies were performed on 72 caecal samples of dissected birds (three primary infected and three further birds/subgroup). Amplification within the hypervariable region V 4 of the 16S rRNA gene was performed and sequenced with the Illumina MiSeq platform. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS Enterprise Guide (version 7.1) and R (version 3.5.2). Both factors, the experimental replication ( < 0.001) and the chickens' age at infection ( < 0.001) contributed significantly to the differences in microbial composition of the caecal samples. The factor experimental replication explained 24% of the sample's variability, whereas the factor age at infection explained 14% thereof. Twelve of 32 families showed a significantly different count profile between the two age groups, whereby strongest differences were seen for seven families, among them the family  (adjusted  = 0.003). The strongest difference between age groups was seen for a bacterial species that is assigned to the genus  which in turn belongs to the family  (adjusted  < 0.0001). Correlation analyses revealed a common relationship in both chicken ages at infection between the absolute abundance of  and , which consists of the genus  In general, concentrations of particular volatile fatty  (VFA) demonstrated a negative correlation to absolute abundance of , whereby the strongest link was seen for n-butyrate (-0.51141;  < 0.0001).

We postulated that diabetes and systemic angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) deficiency would synergize to adversely impact both the  and gut barrier function.  Bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing and metatranscriptomic analysis were performed on fecal samples from WT, ACE2, Akita (type 1 diabetic, T1D), and ACE2-Akita mice. Gut barrier integrity was assessed by immunofluorescence, and BM cell extravasation into the small intestine was evaluated by flow cytometry. In the CE2-Akita or Akita mice, the disrupted barrier was associated with reduced levels of myeloid angiogenic cells (MACs), but no increase in inflammatory monocytes was observed within the gut parenchyma. Genomic and metatranscriptomic analysis of the  of ACE2-Akita mice demonstrated a marked increase in peptidoglycan (PGN) producing bacteria. When compared to control cohorts treated with saline, intraperitoneal administration of MACs significantly decreased the  gene expression associated with PGN biosynthesis and restored epithelial and endothelial gut barrier integrity. Also indicative of diabetic gut barrier dysfunction, increased levels of PGN and intestinal fatty  binding protein-2 (FABP-2) were observed in plasma of human subjects with T1D (n=21) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D, n=23) compared to non-diabetic controls (n=23). Using human retinal endothelial cells, we determined that PGN activates a non-canonical Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) associated MyD88-ARNO-ARF6 signaling cascade, resulting in destabilization of p120-catenin and internalization of VE-cadherin as a mechanism of deleterious impact of PGN on the endothelium.

However, the critical mediators and the signal transductions are not well demonstrated. As ovipara, chicken represents a specific case in lipid metabolism that liver is the main site of lipid synthesis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the linkage of gut  and fat synthesis in broiler chickens. The broilers were subjected to dietary treatments of combined probiotics (: 4 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg, PB) and guar gum (1 g/kg, GG), respectively. Results showed that dietary supplementation of PB and GG changed the cecal  diversity, altered short chain fatty  (SCFAs) contents, and suppressed lipogenesis. In intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) up-regulated the expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, mainly via the phospho - extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phospho-p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways. GLP-1 suppressed lipid accumulation in primary hepatocytes with the involvement of (AMP)-activated protein kinase/Acetyl CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) signaling. In conclusion, the result suggests that SCFAs-induced GLP-1 secretion via MAPK pathway, which links the regulation of gut  on hepatic lipogenesis in chickens.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Sun, Zhao, Chen, Fan, Jiao, Zhao, Wang, Li, Li and Lin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635188>A Fermented Food Product Containing Lactic  Bacteria Protects ZDF Rats from the Development of Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disease, which involves a maintained hyperglycemia due to the development of an insulin resistance process.

In the present study, we have explored the effect of long-term supplementation with a non-dairy fermented food product (FFP) in Zucker Diabetic and Fatty (ZDF) rats T2D model. The supplementation with FFP induced an improvement in glucose homeostasis according to the results obtained from fasting blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance test, and pancreatic function. Importantly, a significantly reduced intestinal glucose absorption was found in the FFP-treated rats. Supplemented animals also showed a greater survival suggesting a better health status as a result of the FFP intake. Some dissimilarities have been observed in the gut  population between control and FFP-treated rats, and interestingly a tendency for better cardiometabolic markers values was appreciated in this group. However, no significant differences were observed in body weight, body composition, or food intake between groups.

Wheat samples were inoculated with cocktails of either 5 serovars of Salmonella enterica, 5 E. coli O157:H7 or 6 non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) strains to achieve a concentration of ~7 log CFU/g. Inoculated samples were allowed to stand for 7-days at temperatures (2.0, 10.8, 24.2, 32 °C) corresponding to those experienced during winter, spring/fall, and summer (average and maximum) in the main wheat growing regions in the state of Nebraska, USA. Besides water, solutions containing  (acetic or lactic 2.5% or 5.0% v/v) and NaCl (~26% w/v) were used for tempering the wheat to 15.0% (soft) and 15.5% (hard) moisture at the different seasonal temperatures. The survival of pathogenic microorganisms throughout the resting period, and before and after tempering was analyzed by plating samples on injury-recovery media. The survival rate of pathogenic microorganisms on wheat kernels was higher at temperatures experienced during the winter (2.0 °C) and spring/fall (10.8 °C) months. Regardless of tempering temperature, the initial pathogen load was reduced significantly by all solutions when compared to the control tempered with water (P ≤ .05). The combination of lactic  (5.0%) and NaCl was the most effective treatment against Salmonella enterica, E. coli O157:H7 and non-O157 STEC, with average reduction values of 1.8, 1.8 and 1.6 log CFU/g for soft wheat and 2.6, 2.4 and 2.4 log CFU/g for hard wheat, respectively.

In this work, polyphenol extracts from  were purified and investigated for the antidiabetic activity in vitro and in vivo. The purified polyphenol extracts exhibited good antioxidant activities, α-glucosidase and lipase inhibition activities (IC < 0.25 mg/mL).

Modulation of FXR and TGR5 activation have been demonstrated to impact the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1, insulin and glucagon as well as energy expenditure and gut  composition with potential beneficial effects on glucose metabolism.A search strategy based on literature searches in pubmed.org with various combinations of the key words FXR, TGR5, agonist, apical sodium-dependent bile  transporter (ASBT), bile  sequestrant, metformin and glucose metabolism has been applied to obtain material for the present review. Furthermore, manual searches including scanning of reference lists in relevant papers and conference proceedings have been performed.This review provides an outline of the link between bile  and glucose metabolism, with a special focus on the gluco-metabolic impact of treatment modalities with modulating effects on bile  physiology; including FXR agonists, TGR5 agonists, ASBT inhibitors, bile  sequestrants and metformin.Any potential beneficial gluco-metabolic effects of FXR-agonists remain to be established, whereas the clinical relevance of TGR5-based treatment modalities seems limited due to substantial safety concerns of TGR5 agonists observed in animal models. The glucose-lowering effects of ASBT inhibitors, bile  sequestrants and metformin are at least partly mediated by modulation of bile  circulation, which might allow an optimization of these bile  modulating treatment modalities.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and pathology are frequently reported in PD, including constipation, increased intestinal permeability, glial pathology, and alterations to gut  composition. α-synuclein can propagate through neuronal systems but the site of origin of α-synuclein pathology, whether it be the gut or the brain, is still unknown. Physical exercise is associated with alleviating symptoms of PD and with altering the composition of the gut .This study investigated the effects of bilateral nigral injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-α-synuclein on enteric neurons, glia and neurochemistry, the gut , and bile  metabolism in rats, some of whom were exposed to voluntary exercise.Nigral overexpression of α-synuclein resulted in significant neuronal loss in the ileal submucosal plexus with no change in enteric glia. In contrast, the myenteric plexus showed a significant increase in glial expression, while neuronal numbers were maintained. Concomitant alterations were observed in the gut  and related bile  metabolism. Voluntary running protected against neuronal loss, increased enteric glial expression, and modified gut  composition in the brain-injected AAV-α-synuclein PD model.These results show that developing nigral α-synuclein pathology in this PD model exerts significant alterations on the enteric nervous system (ENS) and gut  that are receptive to modification by exercise.

Despite its importance, little information is available on the establishment of microbial populations in the goat GIT or on changes occurring during early development. Therefore, this study investigated the bacterial community dynamics of the rumen, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon in 15 goats at five developmental stages (0, 14, 28, 42, and 56 days old) by using 16S rDNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR technology. 940 genera were found to belong to 44 phyla distributed along the GIT. As a whole, the microbial richness and diversity showed a clear increasing trend as the kids aged and alpha diversity differed significantly among GIT compartments mainly occurring at middle day ages (14 and 28 days). Principal coordinate analysis indicated that the bacterial community displayed distinct temporal and spatial specificity along the GIT in preweaning goats. As kids aged, the phylum Firmicutes was replaced by Bacteroidetes in rumen, whereas Proteobacteria in the large intestine was displaced by Firmicutes. The phylum Proteobacteria was mainly present in the small intestine in older animals. In the rumen, taxa, such as  and  decreased and , and unclassified Prevotellaceae increased with the age of kids. Furthermore, a lower proportion of taxa, such as  and  was observed with higher abundances of both  and  in duodenum and jejunum in older animals. In the large intestine, the  displayed taxonomic dynamics with increases of , unclassified , and  as kids aged. Predicted pathway analysis suggested that genes involved in amino  metabolism, and translation were abundant in both rumen and duodenum, while genes involved in membrane transport and carbohydrate metabolism were enriched in the large intestine. These results indicate that both the microbial colonization process and potential function exert a temporal-spatial specificity throughout the GIT of goats.

There was no obvious change in the alpha diversity of gut  of geese with ryegrass intake (P > 0.05) and the composition of dominant bacterium (including Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) was also similar. However, the ratio between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes was remarkably reduced with ryegrass intake (P < 0.05), and the relative abundance of 30 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) significantly differed. Additionally, the content of cellulose-degrading  such as Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010 were significantly increased in geese fed with increasing amounts of grass. Finally, the functional profiles of the goose gut  were explored using the PICRUSt tool. Carbohydrate metabolism and amino  metabolism were dominant metabolic pathways. Lipid metabolism was significantly increased in EG3 compared that in the CK group (P < 0.05). Interestingly, Turicibacter and Parasutterella may have affected abdominal fat deposition as grass intake increased. Taken together, although the diversity of bacterial communities was similar in geese fed with different proportions of ryegrass, cellulose-degrading  (Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010) were abundant and the lipid metabolic pathway was enriched, which may reduce abdominal fat accumulation in high-ryegrass fed geese.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677970>Intersection of the Gut  and Circadian Rhythms in Metabolism.</a></h2><p>The gut  and circadian rhythms (CRs) both exhibit unique influence on mammalian hosts and have been implicated in the context of many diseases, particularly metabolic disorders. It has become increasingly apparent that these systems also interact closely to alter host physiology and metabolism. However, the mechanisms that underlie these observations remain largely unknown. Recent findings have implicated microbially derived mediators as potential signals between the gut  and host circadian clocks; two specific mediators are discussed in this review: short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) and bile  (BAs). Key gaps in knowledge and major challenges that remain in the circadian and  fields are also discussed, including animal versus human models and the need for precise timed sample collection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Folate, or vitamin B, refers to a broad category of biomolecules that include pterin, para-aminobenzoic  (pABA), and glutamate subunits. Folates are required for DNA synthesis and epigenetic regulation. In addition to dietary nutrients, the gut  has been recognized as a source of B complex vitamins, including folate. This study evaluated the predicted folate synthesis capabilities in the genomes of human commensal microbes identified in the Human  Project and folate production by representative strains of six human intestinal bacterial phyla. Bacterial folate synthesis genes were ubiquitous across 512 gastrointestinal reference genomes with 13% of the genomes containing all genes required for complete  folate synthesis. An additional 39% of the genomes had the genetic capacity to synthesize folates in the presence of pABA, an upstream intermediate that can be obtained through diet or from other intestinal microbes. Bacterial folate synthesis was assessed during exponential and stationary phase growth through the evaluation of expression of select folate synthesis genes, quantification of total folate production, and analysis of folate polyglutamylation. Increased expression of key folate synthesis genes was apparent in exponential phase, and increased folate polyglutamylation occurred during late stationary phase. Of the folate producers, we focused on the commensal  to examine host-microbe interactions in relation to folate and examined folate receptors in the physiologically relevant human enteroid model. RNAseq data revealed segment-specific folate receptor distribution. Treatment of human colonoid monolayers with conditioned media (CM) from wild-type  did not influence the expression of key folate transporters proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) or reduced folate carrier (RFC). However, CM from  containing a site-specific inactivation of the  gene, which prevents the bacteria from synthesizing a polyglutamate tail on folate, significantly upregulated RFC expression. No effects were observed using  with a site inactivation of , which results in no folate production. This work sheds light on the contributions of microbial folate to overall folate status and mammalian host metabolism.Copyright © 2019 Engevik, Morra, Röth, Engevik, Spinler, Devaraj, Crawford, Estes, Kalkum and Versalovic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636904>Dietary fibre enrichment of supplemental feed modulates the development of the intestinal tract in suckling piglets.</a></h2><p>Commercial pre-weaning diets are formulated to be highly digestible and nutrient-dense and contain low levels of dietary fibre. In contrast, pigs in a natural setting are manipulating fibre-rich plant material from a young age. Moreover, dietary fibre affects gastrointestinal tract (GIT) development and health in older pigs. We hypothesised that supplemental diets that contain vegetal fibres are accelerating GIT development in suckling piglets in terms of size and functionality. From d 2 of life, sow-suckled piglets had access to a low fibre diet (CON), a diet with a fermentable long-chain arabinoxylan (lc-AXOS), a diet with a largely non-fermentable purified cellulose (CELL), or a diet containing both fibres. During the initial 2 weeks, the control diet was a high-density milk replacer, followed by a dry and highly digestible creep meal. Upon weaning at 25 d, 15 piglets from each treatment group, identified as eaters and originating from six or seven litters, were sacrificed for post-mortem examination of GIT morphology, small intestinal permeability and metabolic profile of the digesta. The  composition of the mid-colon was evaluated in a sub-set of ten piglets.No major statistical interactions between the fibre sources were observed. Piglets consumed the fibre-containing milk supplements and creep diets well. Stomach size and small intestinal permeability was not affected. Large intestinal fill was increased with lc-AXOS only, while relative large intestinal weight was increased with both fibre sources ( < 0.050). Also, CELL decreased ileal pH and tended to increase ileal DM content compared to CON ( < 0.050). Moreover, the concentration of volatile fatty  was increased in the caecum ( < 0.100) and mid-colon ( < 0.050) by addition of CELL. lc-AXOS only stimulated caecal propionate ( < 0.050). The  composition showed a high individual variation and limited dietary impact. Nonetheless, CELL induced minor shifts in specific genera, with notable reductions of -.Adding dietary fibres to the supplemental diet of suckling piglets altered large intestinal morphology but not small intestinal permeability. Moreover, dietary fibre showed effects on fermentation and modest changes of microbial populations in the hindgut, with more prominent effects from the low-fermentable cellulose.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668878>Polyphasic characterization of two novel Lactobacillus spp. isolated from blown salami packages: Description of Lactobacillus halodurans sp. nov. and Lactobacillus salsicarnum sp. nov.</a></h2><p> analysis of blown pack spoiled salami revealed five distinguishable Lactobacillus isolates we could not assign to a known species.

This trial studied CPSC effects on ruminal fermentation, biohydrogenation and the bacterial community in dairy cows. Ten cows were used in a crossover design with two experimental diets and fed during two 63-day periods. The cows were group fed forage ad libitum and the concentrate individually. The concentrates, control and CPSC, were isoenergetic, isoproteic and isofat. The ruminal samples collected at the end of each experimental period were analyzed for short-chain fatty , FA and DNA sequencing. CPSC decreased butyrate molar proportion (4%,  = 0.005). CPSC decreased C16:0 (28%,  < 0.001) and increased C18:0 (14%,  < 0.001) and total monounsaturated FA, especially C18:1 trans-11 (13%,  = 0.023).

In particular, FA was uniquely associated with a marked decrease in sphingolipids, as well as a number of other lipid metabolites, in the face of normal frequencies of circulating natural killer T (NKT) cells. Specific comparison of FA and asthmatic subjects revealed differences in the -sensitive aromatic amino  and secondary bile  metabolism. Children with both FA and asthma exhibited a metabolomic profile that aligned with that of FA alone but not asthma.

In these efforts, computational tools like antiSMASH have played a central role through the analysis of Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs). Thousands of candidate BGCs from microbial genomes have been identified and stored in public databases. Interpreting the function and novelty of these predicted BGCs requires comparison with a well-documented set of BGCs of known function. The MIBiG (Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene Cluster) Data Standard and Repository was established in 2015 to enable curation and storage of known BGCs. Here, we present MIBiG 2.0, which encompasses major updates to the schema, the data, and the online repository itself. Over the past five years, 851 new BGCs have been added. Additionally, we performed extensive manual data curation of all entries to improve the annotation quality of our repository. We also redesigned the data schema to ensure the compliance of future annotations. Finally, we improved the user experience by adding new features such as query searches and a statistics page, and enabled direct link-outs to chemical structure databases.

It is usually diagnosed clinically by direct detection of an abnormal pattern of the intestinal . The intermediate diagnosis based on determining the content of microflora metabolites, considered as chemical markers of this disorder, is still rarely used. This is, among others, due to the variety of properties of compounds recognised as dysbiosis markers and as a consequence, the use of different methods for their analysis. To the best of our knowledge, there is still no analytical procedure that would allow unambiguous determination of all compounds in one procedure. In the present study, we have established a detailed method for the quantitative analysis of hydrocinnamic, citramalic, p-hydroxybenzeneacetic, tartaric, hippuric, 4-hydroxybenzoic, indoxylsulfuric, tricarballylic, 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic and benzoic  along with DL-arabitol that employs the direct derivatization of compounds in a small volume of urine sample followed by gas chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS).

In this conversion, most of the plant materials are digested by rumen fermentation and are changed to short-chain fatty , microbial cells, and methane, which is released into the atmosphere. The relationships among feed, rumen fermentation, and milk production are poorly understood. Here we report a novel indicator of characteristics of rumen fermentation, theoretical turnover rate (TTOR) of the rumen liquid fraction. The TTOR was calculated from the presumed rumen volume (PRV) which is estimated by dividing the methane yield by the methane concentration of rumen fluid. The formula for the TTOR is: TTOR = PRV/body weight . Our present analyses confirm that the TTOR as an indicator is capable of connecting feed, rumen fermentation, and milk production, because dry matter intake/TTOR showed a strong correlation with milk yield/TTOR. In addition, the TTOR may be related to ruminal pH, as we observed that the ruminal pH decreased as the TTOR increased. We propose that the TTOR is a factor characterizing rumen fermentation and a good indicator of the productivity of ruminants and dysbiosis of the rumen .© 2019 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681210>Lactic  Treatment of Cereals and Dietary Phytase Modified Fecal  Composition Without Affecting Expression of Virulence Factor Genes in Growing Pigs.</a></h2><p>Besides the major nutrients, phosphorus (P) is an essential mineral for both the host animal and the porcine gut . Different strategies including phytase supplementation and more recently lactic  (LA) are used to enhance the P availability from cereals in pig diets; however, their impact on the gut  has been rarely related to fecal shedding of opportunistic pathogens.

Phytase supplementation reduced the fecal abundance of the most abundant  family, whereas the LA-treatment of cereals had a stronger impact on the bacterial community, reducing amylolytic, pullulanolytic and hemicellulolytic ,  and  as well as the fecal bacterial species richness (Chao1) and diversity (Shannon index).

Dietary fiber and phytochemicals are bioactive grain compounds, which could be involved in mediating these beneficial effects. These compounds are not equally distributed in the wheat grain, but are enriched in the bran and aleurone fractions. As little is known on physiological effects of different wheat fractions, the aim of this study was to investigate this aspect in an obesity model. For twelve weeks, C57BL/6J mice were fed high-fat diets (HFD), supplemented with one of four wheat fractions: whole grain flour, refined white flour, bran, or aleurone. The different diets did not affect body weight, however bran and aleurone decreased liver triglyceride content, and increased hepatic n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) concentrations. Furthermore, lipidomics analysis revealed increased PUFA concentration in the lipid classes of phosphatidylcholine (PC), PC-ether, and phosphatidylinositol in the plasma of mice fed whole grain, bran, and aleurone supplemented diets, compared to refined white flour. Furthermore, bran, aleurone, and whole grain supplemented diets increased microbial α-diversity, but only bran and aleurone increased the cecal concentrations of short-chain fatty .

Here, we intended to explore whether in our animal model there were changes in gut permeability, fecal  and hepatic injury. Moreover, we tested if the co-treatment with an electrolyzed reduced (ERW) was effective to protect against alterations induced by PERM. Rats (from postnatal day 6 to 21) were gavaged daily with PERM, PERM+ERW or vehicle and gut, liver and feces were analyzed in 2-months-old rats. Increased gut permeability, measured by FITC-dextran assay, was detected in PERM group compared to control and PERM+ERW groups. In duodenum and ileum, concentration of occludin was higher in control group than those measured in PERM group, whereas only in duodenum ZO-1 was higher in control than those measured in PERM and PERM+ERW groups. Number of inflammatory focis and neutrophils as well as iNOS protein levels were higher in livers of PERM-treated rats than in those of PERM+ERW and control rats. Fecal  analysis revealed that Lachnospira was less abundant and Defluviitaleaceae more abundant in the PERM group, whereas the co-treatment with ERW was protective against PERM treatment since the abundances in Lachnospira and Defluviitaleaceae were similar to those in the control group. Higher abundances of butyrate- producing bacteria such as Blautia, U.m. of Lachnospiraceae family, U.m. of Ruminococcaceae family, Papillibacter, Roseburia, Intestinimonas, Shuttleworthia together with higher butyric  levels were detected in PERM+ERW group compared to the other groups.

Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut  composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty  (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut  variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut  by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut , which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649643>Exploring the Link Between the Geographical Origin of European Fermented Foods and the Diversity of Their Bacterial Communities: The Case of Fermented Meats.</a></h2><p>European fermented meat products are prepared according to a wide variety of different recipes and processing conditions, which can influence their fermentative .

Therefore, the bacterial species diversity of 80 fermented meat products available in the Belgian retail, coming from five different countries, was investigated. It was also assessed how this related to the country of origin and the key processing parameters pH and salt concentration. The samples originated from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. In general, Southern European fermented meat products commonly had a higher pH, with their lactic  bacteria (LAB) communities being represented by  and with mostly  and  governing over the coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) communities.

However, dietary adherence is challenging to maintain while ensuring adequate nutrition, which can lead to sub-optimal clinical outcomes. Metabolomics offers a systematic approach to identify new biomarkers of disease progression in PKU when using urine as a surrogate for blood specimens that is more accurate than self-reported diet records. Herein, the plasma and urine metabolome of a cohort of classic PKU patients (median age = 11 years; n = 22) mainly prescribed (78%) a Phe-restricted diet were characterized using multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (MSI-CE-MS). Overall, there was good mutual agreement between plasma Phe and tyrosine (Tyr) concentrations measured from PKU patients when using an amino  analyzer based on UPLC-UV as compared to MSI-CE-MS with a mean bias of 12% (n = 82). Longitudinal measurements of recently diagnosed PKU infants (n = 3) revealed good long-term regulation of blood Phe with dietary management, and only occasional episodes exceeding the recommended therapeutic range (>360 μM) unlike older PKU patients. Plasma metabolomic studies demonstrated that non-adherent PKU patients had lower circulating concentrations of Tyr, arginine, 2-aminobutyric , and propionylcarnitine (q < 0.05, FDR) that were inversely correlated to Phe (r ≈ -0.600 to -0.830). Nontargeted metabolite profiling also revealed urinary biomarkers associated with poor dietary adherence among PKU patients, including elevated concentrations of catabolites indicative of Phe intoxication (e.g., phenylpyruvic , phenylacetylglutamine, hydroxyphenylacetic ). Additionally, PKU patients with poor blood Phe control had lower excretion of urinary compounds derived from co-metabolism of Tyr due to  activity (e.g., cresol sulfate, phenylsulfate), as well as several metabolites associated with inadequate nutrient intake, including low carnitine and B vitamin status (e.g., folic , vitamin B12). Interestingly, an unknown urinary metabolite was strongly correlated with Phe excretion in PKU patients (r = 0.861), which was subsequently identified as imidazole lactic  when using high resolution MS/MS. Overall, urine profiling offers a non-invasive approach for better treatment monitoring of individual PKU patients, which can also guide the design of novel therapies that improve adherence to Phe-restricted diets without acquired nutritional deficiencies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655732>Periodontal disease: From the lenses of light microscopy to the specs of proteomics and next-generation sequencing.</a></h2><p>Periodontal disease entails the inflammatory destruction of the tooth supporting (periodontal) tissues as a result of polymicrobial colonization of the tooth surface in the form of biofilms. Extensive data collected over the past decades on this chronic disease demonstrate that its progression is infrequent and episodic, and the susceptibility to it can vary among individuals. Physical assessments of previously occurring damage to periodontal tissues remain the cornerstone of detection and diagnosis, whereas traditionally used diagnostic procedures do neither identify susceptible individuals nor distinguish between disease-active and disease-inactive periodontal sites. Thus, more sensitive and accurate "measurable biological indicators" of periodontal diseases are needed in order to place diagnosis (e.g., the presence or stage) and management of the disease on a more rational less empirical basis. Contemporary "omics" technologies may help unlock the path to this quest. High throughput nucleic  sequencing technologies have enabled us to examine the taxonomic distribution of microbial communities in oral health and disease, whereas proteomic technologies allowed us to decipher the molecular state of the host in disease, as well as the interactive cross-talk of the host with the . The newly established field of metaproteomics has enabled the identification of the repertoire of proteins that oral microorganisms use to compete or co-operate with each other. Vast such data is derived from oral biological fluids, including gingival crevicular fluid and saliva, which is progressively completed and catalogued as the analytical technologies and bioinformatics tools progressively advance. This chapter covers the current "omics"-derived knowledge on the , the host and their "interactome" with regard to periodontal diseases, and addresses challenges and opportunities ahead.© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Abnormalities in this -gut-brain axis have emerged as a key component in the pathophysiology of depression, leading to more research attempting to understand the neuroactive potential of the products of gut microbial metabolism. This review explores the potential for the gut  to contribute to depression and focuses on the role that microbially-derived molecules - neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty , indoles, bile , choline metabolites, lactate and vitamins - play in the context of emotional behavior. The future of gut-brain axis research lies is moving away from association, towards the mechanisms underlying the relationship between the gut bacteria and depressive behavior. We propose that direct and indirect mechanisms exist through which gut microbial metabolites affect depressive behavior: these include (i) direct stimulation of central receptors, (ii) peripheral stimulation of neural, endocrine, and immune mediators, and (iii) epigenetic regulation of histone acetylation and DNA methylation. Elucidating these mechanisms is essential to expand our understanding of the etiology of depression, and to develop new strategies to harness the beneficial psychotropic effects of these molecules. Overall, the review highlights the potential for dietary interventions to represent such novel therapeutic strategies for major depressive disorder.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659726>Growth and Nutrition in Cystic Fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Optimal nutrition support has been integral in the management of cystic fibrosis (CF) since the disease was initially described. Nutritional status has a clear relationship with disease outcomes, and malnutrition in CF is typically a result of chronic negative energy balance secondary to malabsorption. As the mechanisms underlying the pathology of CF and its implications on nutrient absorption and energy expenditure have been elucidated, nutrition support has become increasingly sophisticated. Comprehensive nutrition monitoring and treatment guidelines from professional and advocacy organizations have unified the approach to nutrition optimization around the world. Newborn screening allows for early nutrition intervention and improvement in short- and long-term growth and other clinical outcomes. The nutrition support goal in CF care includes achieving optimal nutritional status to support growth and pubertal development in children, maintenance of optimal nutritional status in adult life, and optimizing fat soluble vitamin and essential fatty  status. The mainstay of this approach is a high calorie, high-fat diet, exceeding age, and sex energy intake recommendations for healthy individuals. For patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, enzyme replacement therapy is required to improve fat and calorie absorption. Enzyme dosing varies by age and dietary fat intake. Multiple potential impediments to absorption, including decreased motility, altered gut luminal bile salt and  composition, and enteric inflammation must be considered. Fat soluble vitamin supplementation is required in patients with pancreatic insufficiency. In this report, nutrition support across the age and disease spectrum is discussed, with a focus on the relationships among nutritional status, growth, and disease outcomes.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623075>Gut  Modulation Based on Probiotic Application for Anti-Obesity: A Review on Efficacy and Validation.</a></h2><p>The growing prevalence of obesity has become an important problem worldwide as obesity has several health risks. Notably, factors such as excessive food consumption, a sedentary way of life, high sugar consumption, a fat-rich diet, and a certain genetic profile may lead to obesity. The present review brings together recent advances regarding the significance of interventions involving intestinal gut bacteria and host metabolic phenotypes. We assess important biological molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of gut  on hosts including bile salt metabolism, short-chain fatty , and metabolic endotoxemia. Some previous studies have shown a link between  and obesity, and associated disease reports have been documented. Thus, this review focuses on obesity and gut  interactions and further develops the mechanism of the gut  approach related to human obesity. Specifically, we highlight several alternative diet treatments including dietary changes and supplementation with probiotics. The future direction or comparative significance of fecal transplantation, synbiotics, and metabolomics as an approach to the modulation of intestinal microbes is also discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679421>Guidelines for Transparency on Gut  Studies in Essential and Experimental Hypertension.</a></h2><p>Hypertension is a complex and modifiable condition in which environmental factors contribute to both onset and progression. Recent evidence has accumulated for roles of diet and the gut  as environmental factors in blood pressure regulation. However, this is complex because gut microbiomes are a unique feature of each individual reflecting that individual's developmental and environmental history creating caveats for both experimental models and human studies. Here, we describe guidelines for conducting gut  studies in experimental and clinical hypertension. We provide a complete guide for authors on proper design, analyses, and reporting of gut / and metabolite studies and checklists that can be used by reviewers and editors to support robust reporting and interpretation. We discuss factors that modulate the gut  in animal (eg, cohort, controls, diet, developmental age, housing, sex, and models used) and human studies (eg, blood pressure measurement and medication, body mass index, demographic characteristics including age, cultural identification, living structure, sex and socioeconomic environment, and exclusion criteria). We also provide best practice advice on sampling, storage of fecal/cecal samples, DNA extraction, sequencing methods (including metagenomics and 16S rRNA), and computational analyses. Finally, we discuss the measurement of short-chain fatty , metabolites produced by the gut , and interpretation of data.

Although Lepidoptera is one of the most diverse insect taxa and includes important agricultural pests, their microbiotas have not been studied much, particularly functional traits. Here, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the gut  across multiple mulberry-feeding lepidopteran species, resolving both community structure and metabolic potential.Our results indicate abundant bacteria inside the gut of larval Lepidoptera. However, even though they were fed the same diet, the structures of the bacterial communities differed in four major mulberry pest species, suggesting host-specific effects on microbial associations. Community-level metabolic reconstructions further showed that despite taxonomic composition varied greatly, carbohydrate and amino  metabolism and membrane transporter were key functional capabilities of gut bacteria in all samples, which may play basic roles in the larval gut. In addition, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of gut bacterial predicted gene ontologies revealed specialized features of the microbiotas associated with these mulberry pests, which were divided into two distinct clusters (macrolepidopterans vs. microlepidopterans). This pattern became even more prominent when more Lepidoptera species involved.A suite of gut  metabolic functions significantly correlated with larval size; the metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides, xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism were specifically enriched in large species, while small larvae had enhanced nucleotide metabolism. Our report paves the way for uncovering the correlation between host phenotype and microbial symbiosis in this notorious insect pest group. This article is protected by copyright.

Its presence within the animal and human intestinal  was correlated with immunomodulatory effects, mediated by both propionibacterial surface components and by secreted metabolites. It is widely implemented, both in the manufacture of fermented dairy products such as Swiss-type cheeses, and in the production of probiotic food complements, under the form of freeze-dried powders. The bottleneck of this drying process consists in the limited survival of bacteria during drying and storage. Protective pre-treatments have been applied to other bacteria and may, in a strain-dependent manner, confer enhanced resistance. However, very little information was yet published on  adaptation to freeze-drying. In this report, an immunomodulatory strain of this probiotic bacterium was cultured under hyperosmotic constraint in order to trigger osmoadaptation. This adaptation was then combined with  or thermal pre-treatment. Such combination led to accumulation of key stress proteins, of intracellular compatible solute glycine betaine, to modulation of the propionibacterial membrane composition, and to enhanced survival upon freeze-drying.

We aimed to examine the effect of Sil on intestinal flora dysbiosis induced by high-fat diet (HFD).After 10 weeks of feeding normal chow diet (NCD) or HFD, mice were given daily by gavage for 8 weeks. Cecal contents were harvested for study of short chain fatty  (SCFAs), bile  and gut  alteration.Sil showed protective effects against dietary-induced obesity and liver steatosis, accordingly gut  composition changed. At phylum level, compared with HFD group, mice in the Sil-treated group had significant lower level of Firmicutes and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (P<0.05). At genus level, Sil-treated group have significant lower level of Lachnoclostridium, Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006 and Mollicutes_RF9, which were reported to be potentially related to diet-induced obesity, and increased levels of Blautia (P<0.05), Akkermansia (P<0.05), Bacteroides(P<0.05) which were known to have beneficial effect on improving NAFLD. Sil also showed inhibitory effect on well-known beneficial bacteria, such as Alloprevotella, Lactobacillus. Moreover, production of acetate, propionate and butyrate increased, while generation of formate and conversion of cytotoxic secondary metabolites (LCA, DCA) decreased in mice treated with Sil.Sil might have beneficial effects on ameliorating NAFLD and mediate HFD-induced change of gut  composition, followed with major changes in secondary metabolites, such as SCFAs and BAs.This article is protected by copyright.

RbgA is one of these GTPases and is required for the assembly of the 50S subunit in most bacteria. Homologs of this protein are also implicated in the assembly of the large subunit of the mitochondrial and eukaryotic ribosome. We present here the cryo-electron microscopy structure of RbgA bound to a Bacillus subtilis 50S subunit assembly intermediate (45SRbgA particle) that accumulates in cells upon RbgA depletion. Binding of RbgA at the P site of the immature particle stabilizes functionally important rRNA helices in the A and P-sites, prior to the completion of the maturation process of the subunit. The structure also reveals the location of the highly conserved N-terminal end of RbgA containing the catalytic residue Histidine 9. The derived model supports a mechanism of GTP hydrolysis, and it shows that upon interaction of RbgA with the 45SRbgA particle, Histidine 9 positions itself near the nucleotide potentially acting as the catalytic residue with minimal rearrangements. This structure represents the first visualization of the conformational changes induced by an assembly factor in a bacterial subunit intermediate.© The Author(s) 2019.

We performed a high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing association study and serum metabolomics profiling in rats with a high-sugar diet. Our studies revealed that the high sugar diet reduced the diversity of cecal microorganisms, while the combination of theabrownin and the high sugar diet increased the diversity of cecal microorganisms and promoted reproduction of Alloprevotella, Coprostanoligenes_group, Bacteroides, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Desulfovibrio, Intestinimonas, Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Staphylococcus. The combination also inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus, Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1_group and Tyzzerella. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio can be significantly reduced after the intervention of theabrownin in high sugar diet rats, and the reproduction of Bacteroides acidifaciens (BA) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus can be promoted. We found that the obesity-associated gut microbial species were linked to the changes in circulating metabolites. Serum levels of deoxycholic , cholic , 1H-indole-3-acetic , 3-indole acrylic  and melatonin were negatively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but positively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum and Gut_metagenome. 2-Hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-3-carboxylic , l-homoserine, and 1,7-dimethylxanthine were positively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but negatively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, and Gut_metagenome. In a high sugar diet mode, theabrownin reduced the body weight and triglycerides and improved insulin resistance mainly by targeting the reproduction of intestinal microorganisms such as BA, Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, Gut_metagenome and so on. A strong correlation between cecal microorganisms and serum metabolites, obesity and insulin resistance was observed.

Enterococcal infections, mainly caused by Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, include apical periodontitis, endocarditis, and bloodstream infections. Recently, vancomycinresistant Enterococci are considered major pathogens that are common but difficult to treat, especially in nosocomial settings. Moreover, E. faecalis is closely associated with recurrent endodontic infections and failed endodontic treatment. In this study, we investigated the effects of short-chain fatty  (SCFAs), acetate, propionate, and butyrate, which are metabolites fermented by gut , on the growth of Enterococci. Enterococci were cultured in the presence or absence of acetate, propionate, or butyrate, and the optical density at 600 nm was measured to determine bacterial growth. The minimum inhibitory concentration/minimum bactericidal concentration test was conducted. Bacteria were treated with a SCFA, together with clinically used endodontic treatment methods such as triple antibiotics (metronidazole, minocycline, and ciprofloxacin) and chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) to determine the effects of combination treatment. Of the SCFAs, propionate had a bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of E. faecalis in a dose-dependent manner and also that of clinical strains of E. faecalis isolated from dental plaques. Meanwhile, acetate and butyrate had minimal effects on E. faecalis growth. Moreover, propionate inhibited the growth of other Enterococci including E. faecium. In addition, combination treatment of propionate and triple antibiotics led to further growth inhibition, whereas no cooperative effect was observed at propionate plus CHX. These results indicate that propionate attenuates the growth of Enterococci, suggesting propionate as a potential agent to control Enterococcal infections, especially when combined with triple antibiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571170>Intestinal Transporter-Associated Drug Absorption and Toxicity.</a></h2><p>Oral drug administration is the most favorable route of drug administration in the clinic. Intestinal transporters have been shown to play a significant role in the rate and extent of drug absorption of some, but not all, drug molecules. Due to the heterogeneous expression of multiple transporters along the intestine, the preferential absorption sites for drugs may vary significantly. In this chapter, we aim to summarize the current research on the expression, localization, function, and regulation of human intestinal transporters implicated in altering the absorption of low to medium molecular weight drug molecules. The role played by bile  transport proteins (e.g., ASBT and OST-α/β) is included in the discussion. The synergistic action of intestinal drug metabolism and transport is also discussed. Despite the complicated regulatory factors, the biopharmaceutics drug disposition classification system (BDDCS) put forward by Wu and Benet may help us better predict the effect of transporters on drug absorption.

Despite the common occurrence of yeast (primarily Candida) within the vaginal , there is still an incomplete picture of relationships between yeast and bacteria (especially lactobacilli), as well as how such associations are governed. Such relationships could be important to a more holistic understanding of the vaginal  and its connection to reproductive health.To perform molecular characterization of clinical specimens to define associations between vaginal bacteria (especially Lactobacillus species) and Candida colonization. In vitro studies were conducted to test the two most common dominant Lactobacillus species (Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus iners) in their ability to inhibit Candida growth and to examine the basis for such inhibition.A nested cross-sectional study of reproductive age women from the Contraceptive CHOICE Project was conducted. Vaginal swabs from 299 women were selected to balance race and BV status, resulting in similar representation of black and white women in each of the three Nugent score categories [normal (0-3), intermediate (4-6), and bacterial vaginosis (7-10)]. Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal gene (V4 region) was used to determine the dominant Lactobacillus species present (primarily L. iners and L. crispatus), defined as >50% of the community. Subjects without dominance by a single Lactobacillus species were classified as Diverse. A Candida-specific qPCR targeting the internally transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) was validated using vaginal samples collected from a second cohort of women and used to assess Candida colonization. 255 nonpregnant women with sufficient bacterial biomass for analysis were included in the final analysis. Generalized linear models were employed to evaluate associations between Lactobacillus dominance, sociodemographic and risk characteristics and vaginal Candida colonization. In separate in vitro studies, the potential of cell-free supernatants from L. crispatus and L. iners cultures to inhibit Candida growth was evaluated.Forty-two women (16%) were vaginally colonized with Candida. Microbiomes characterized as Diverse (38%), L. iners-dominant (39%), and L. crispatus-dominant (20%) were the most common. The , race and Candida colonization co-varied with a higher prevalence of Candida among black women and L. iners-dominant communities compared to white women and L. crispatus-dominant communities. L. iners-dominant communities were more likely to harbor Candida than L. crispatus-dominant communities (OR = 2.85, 95% CI: 1.03 to 7.21; Fisher's Exact, p = 0.048). In vitro, L. crispatus produced greater concentrations of lactic  and exhibited significantly more pH-dependent growth inhibition of C. albicans, suggesting a potential mechanism for the clinical observations.In nonpregnant women, L. iners-dominant communities were significantly more likely to harbor Candida than L. crispatus-dominant communities, suggesting that Lactobacillus species have different relationships with Candida. In vitro experiments indicate that L. crispatus may impede Candida colonization more effectively than L. iners through a greater production of lactic .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

After FOS intervention, there were significant increases in the total and wall weights of the cecum and the amount of total short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) in the cecal contents of the mice. At the phylum level, the results showed a significant increase in the relative abundance of Actinobacteria in the contents and mucosa from the cecum to the distal colon in the FOS group. Besides , a significant increase was observed in the relative abundance of  in all samples at the genus level, which may be partially related to the increase in butyric  levels in the luminal contents. Furthermore,  sequencing revealed that  was almost the sole bifidobacterial species in the luminal contents (>98%) and mucosa (>89%).

Moreover, PHGG significantly elevated the activities of antioxidant enzymes and decreased the content of malondialdehyde in rat serum and brain. The oxidative damage was also significantly alleviated in the liver and hippocampus and the expressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and choline acetyltransferase also increased. Furthermore, PHGG treatment could significantly regulated the expression of sirtuin 1, forkhead box O1, and tumor protein p53 in the hippocampus.

We sequenced the 16S rRNA V3-V4 region of gut  and detected metabolites based on liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) in faecal samples.The composition of both the gut  and faecal metabolites changed significantly with T2D patients. The abundance of Proteobacteria and the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes were higher in T2D patients than healthy subjects, and the short chain fatty  (SCFAs), bile  and lipids of T2D patients were significantly disordered. Moreover, the abundances of certain SCFA-producing bacteria (Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae etc.) were significantly increased in T2D patients, while the faecal SCFAs concentrations were significantly decreased.

Specially, most modules including certain SCFA-producing bacteria were comprehensively correlated to body mass index, the levels of blood glucose, blood pressure, blood cholesterol and faecal bile  and lipids.Our study identified the relationships between the gut  and faecal metabolites, and provided a resource for future studies to understand host-gut  interactions in T2D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671233>Effects of acute heat stress on intestinal  in grow-finishing pigs, and associations with feed intake and serum profile.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to assess the effects of acute heat stress (HS) on intestinal , and the associations with the changes in feed intake (FI) and serum profile.Twenty four individually housed pigs (Duroc × Large White × Landrace, 30 ± 1 kg body weight) were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 treatments (8 pigs / treatment): 1) thermal neutral (TN) conditions (25 ± 1°C), 2) HS conditions (35 ± 1°C), 3) pair-feeding (PF) with HS under TN conditions. After 24-h treatment, pigs were monitored to assess feed intake (FI), and samples of serum and feces were collected to investigate serum profile, microbial composition, and short chain fatty  (SCFAs). The results showed that HS decreased (P < 0.05) FI compared with the TN group. Compared with TN group, HS changed serum profile by affecting biochemical parameters and hormones related with energy metabolism and stress response; immune indicators were also altered in HS group. Most of changes in serum profile were independent of FI reduction. Additionally, HS shifted the diversity and composition of fecal microbial community by increasing (P < 0.05) Proteobacteria and decreasing (P < 0.05) Bacteroidetes. Moreover, HS decreased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of propionate, butyrate, valerate, iso-valerate, and total SCFAs in feces with a FI-independent manner. Furthermore, the Spearman correlation analysis implied that changes of serum profile have potential correlation with alterations of fecal  and their metabolites SCFAs in acute HS-treated grow-finishing pigs.Metabolism disorders caused by 24-h acute HS associated with changes of fecal  and their metabolites SCFAs with a FI-independent manner in grow-finishing pigs.These results give us a new insight of the intestinal damage caused by acute HS and the underlying mechanisms.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31584799>Evaluation of Direct from Sample Metabolomics of Human Feces Using Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass Spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Mass spectrometry is a powerful tool in the investigation of the human fecal metabolome. However, current approaches require time-consuming sample preparation, chromatographic separations, and consequently long analytical run times. Rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS) is a method of ambient ionization mass spectrometry and has been utilized in the metabolic profiling of a diverse range of biological materials, including human tissue, cell culture lines, and microorganisms. Here, we describe the use of an automated, high-throughput REIMS robotic platform for direct analysis of human feces. Through the analysis of fecal samples from five healthy male participants, REIMS analytical parameters were optimized and used to assess the chemical information obtainable using REIMS. Within the fecal samples analyzed, bile , including primary, secondary, and conjugate species, were identified, and phospholipids of possible bacterial origin were detected. In addition, the effect of storage conditions and consecutive freeze/thaw cycles was determined. Within the REIMS mass spectra, the lower molecular weight metabolites, such as fatty , were shown to be significantly affected by storage conditions for prolonged periods at temperatures above -80 °C and consecutive freeze/thaw cycles. However, the complex lipid region was shown to be unaffected by these conditions. A further cohort of 50 fecal samples, collected from patients undergoing bariatric surgery, were analyzed using the optimized REIMS parameters and the complex lipid region mass spectra used for multivariate modeling. This analysis showed a predicted separation between pre- and post-surgery specimens, suggesting that REIMS analysis can detect biological differences, such as -level differences, which have traditionally been reliant upon methods utilizing extensive sample preparations and chromatographic separations and/or DNA sequencing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629514>Analyses of physicochemical properties, bacterial , and lactic  bacteria of fresh camel milk collected in Inner Mongolia.</a></h2><p>Camel milk has significant economic value and is an important food in the region of Alxa Left Banner of Inner Mongolia. Fifteen fresh camel milk samples were collected from domesticated camels in a pasture of Alxa Left Banner. The physicochemical properties and bacterial diversity of camel milk samples were analyzed. The average values of fat, total protein, nonfat milk solids, acidity, and density were 4.40%, 3.87%, 9.50%, 16.95°T, and 1.02 g/cm, respectively. The bacterial  of the collected fresh camel milk was investigated using PacBio single-molecule real-time (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA) sequencing. The camel milk  was highly diverse and comprised 8,513 operational taxonomic units belonging to 32 phyla, 377 genera, and 652 species. The major phyla included Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Deinococcus-Thermus, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria. A small number of lactic  bacteria sequences were detected, representing the species Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus lactis, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. A total of 72 strains of lactic  bacteria were isolated and identified from 15 samples, including Lactobacillus paracasei, Enterococcus italicus, Enterococcus durans, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Weissella confusa, and Enterococcus faecium.

This may result from altered energy metabolism or dietary habits.We hypothesized that a lower intake of BCAAs improves tissue-specific insulin sensitivity.This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial examined well-controlled T2D patients receiving isocaloric diets (protein: 1 g/kg body weight) for 4 wk. Protein requirements were covered by commercially available food supplemented ≤60% by an AA mixture either containing all AAs or lacking BCAAs. The dietary intervention ensured sufficient BCAA supply above the recommended minimum daily intake. The patients underwent the mixed meal tolerance test (MMT), hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (HECs), and skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue biopsies to assess insulin signaling.After the BCAA- diet, BCAAs were reduced by 17% during fasting (P < 0.001), by 13% during HEC (P < 0.01), and by 62% during the MMT (P < 0.001). Under clamp conditions, whole-body and hepatic insulin sensitivity did not differ between diets. After the BCAA- diet, however, the oral glucose sensitivity index was 24% (P < 0.01) and circulating fibroblast-growth factor 21 was 21% higher (P < 0.05), whereas meal-derived insulin secretion was 28% lower (P < 0.05).

The results showed that three DSE strains could effectively colonize the plant roots and form a strain-dependent symbiosis with licorice. Although drought stress declined the growth of licorice plants, these decreases were partly recovered by DSE inoculation. Specifically, the inoculation of  and  significantly increased the biomass and glycyrrhizin content, whereas  and  increased glycyrrhizic  content of host plants under drought stress. However, the inoculation of  showed significant negative effects on the shoot, root, and total biomass of licorice plants. In addition, the effects of DSE inoculation on the morphological, photosynthetic, and antioxidant parameters of licorice plants, and mineral nutrient and microbial community composition in the rhizosphere soil were dependent on the DSE species as well as water regime. Interestingly, DSE inoculation significantly increased AM fungi content under drought stress. In addition, DSE associated with water had a significant positive influence on soil organic matter, available phosphorus (P), AM fungi, leaf number, soluble protein, SOD activity, total root length, root branch, and glycyrrhizic  content. Based on the results of variance partitioning analysis, 17.0, 34.0, 14.9, 40.1, 28.2, and 18.0% variations in shoot morphology, root morphology, plant biomass, active ingredient, photosynthetic parameters, and antioxidant parameters, respectively, were attributable to the presence of certain soil microorganisms. These findings suggest the possibility that DSE inoculation improved the root development and nutrient absorption of host plants, altered the soil , and might also contribute to plant growth and survival under drought conditions. As  exhibited positive effects on the plant biomass, morphological and physiological parameters, and active ingredient content in licorice plants under drought stress, it was considered to be the best fungus for licorice cultivation.

The objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of increasing dietary inclusion levels of laminarin in the first 14 days post-weaning on pig growth performance and weaning associated intestinal dysfunction. At weaning, 96 pigs (8.4 (SD 1.09) kg) (meatline boars x (large white x landrace sows) were blocked by live weight, litter and sex and randomly assigned to: 1) basal diet; 2) basal + 100ppm laminarin; 3) basal + 200ppm laminarin; 4) basal + 300ppm laminarin (3 pigs/pen). The appropriate quantity of a laminarin rich extract (65% laminarin) was added to the basal diet to achieve the above dietary inclusion levels of laminarin. After 14 days of supplementation, 8 pigs from the basal group and the best performing laminarin group were euthanised for sample collection. The 300ppm laminarin group was selected as this group had higher ADFI compared to all other groups and higher ADG than the basal group (P<0.05). Laminarin supplementation increased villus height in the duodenum and jejunum (P<0.05). Laminarin supplementation increased the expression of SLC2A8/GLUT8 in the duodenum, SLC2A2/GLUT2, SLC2A7/GLUT7, SLC15A1/PEPT1 and FABP2 in the jejunum, and SLC16A1/MCT1 in the colon. Laminarin supplementation reduced Enterobacteriaceae numbers in the caecum (P<0.05), and increased lactobacilli numbers (P<0.05), total volatile fatty  concentrations and the molar proportions of butyrate (P<0.01) in the colon. In conclusion, 300ppm laminarin from a laminarin rich extract has potential, as a dietary supplement, to improve performance and prevent post-weaning intestinal dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638593>Targeting the Infant Gut  Through a Perinatal Educational Dietary Intervention: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>The early life gut  are an important regulator of the biological pathways contributing toward the pathogenesis of noncommunicable disease. It is unclear whether improvements to perinatal diet quality could alter the infant gut .The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a perinatal educational dietary intervention in influencing gut  in mothers and infants 4 weeks after birth.The Healthy Parents, Healthy Kids randomized controlled trial aimed to recruit 90 pregnant women from Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. At week 26 of gestation, women were randomized to receive dietary advice from their doctor (n=45), or additionally receive a dietary intervention (n=45). The intervention included an educational workshop and 2 support calls aiming to align participants' diets with the Australian Dietary Guidelines and increase intakes of prebiotic and probiotic foods. The educational design focused on active learning and self-assessment. Behavior change techniques were used to support dietary adherence, and the target behavior was eating for the gut . Exclusion criteria were age under 18 years, diagnosed mental illnesses, obesity, diabetes mellitus, diagnosed bowel conditions, exclusion diets, illicit drug use, antibiotic use, prebiotic or probiotic supplementation, and those lacking dietary autonomy. The primary outcome measure is a between-group difference in alpha diversity in infant stool collected 4 weeks after birth. Secondary outcomes include evaluating the efficacy of the intervention in influencing infant and maternal stool microbial composition and short chain fatty  concentrations, epigenetic profile, and markers of inflammation and stress, as well as changes in maternal dietary intake and well-being. The study and intervention feasibility and acceptance will also be evaluated as secondary outcomes.The study results are yet to be written. The first participant was enrolled on July 28, 2016, and the final follow-up assessment was completed on October 11, 2017.Data from this study will provide new insights regarding the ability of interventions targeting the perinatal diet to alter the maternal and infant gut . If this intervention is proven, our findings will support larger studies aiming to guide the assembly of gut  in early life.Australian Clinical Trials Registration Number ACTRN12616000936426; https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=370939.DERR1-10.2196/14771.©Samantha L L.

We determined whether measuring specific compounds in vaginal fluid might be a simple, noninvasive, and cost-effective way to predict the bacteria that dominate the vaginal  and indicate the presence of a shortened cervix (<25 mm). Vaginal fluid samples were prospectively collected from mid-trimester pregnant women, and the concentrations of d- and l-lactic , tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-8, the 70-kDa heat shock protein, a2 isoform of vacuolar ATPase, and sequestrome-1 were quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The compositions of vaginal microbiomes were assessed by analysis of the V1-V3 regions of 16S rRNA genes, while cervical length was determined by transvaginal ultrasonography. The vaginal microbiomes could be clustered into five community state types (CSTs), four of which were dominated by a single  species. The dominance of  or  in the vaginal  predicted the level of d-lactic  present. Several of the biomarkers, especially TIMP-1, in combination with the subject's age and race, were significantly associated with cervical length. Using piecewise structural equation modeling, we established a causal network that links CST to cervical length via biomarkers. We concluded that measuring levels of TIMP-1 and d-lactic  in vaginal secretions might be a straightforward way to assess the risk for preterm birth due to a short cervix and  composition. Premature birth and its complications are the largest contributors to infant death in the United States and globally. A short cervical length and the depletion of  species are known risk factors for preterm birth. However, in many resource-poor areas of the world, the technology to test for their occurrence is unavailable, and pregnant women with these risk factors are neither identified nor treated. In this study, we used path analysis to gain an unprecedented understanding of interactions between vaginal  composition, the concentrations of various compounds in vaginal secretions, and cervical length. We identified low-cost point-of-care measures that might be used to identify pregnant women at risk for preterm birth. The use of these measures coupled with appropriate preventative or treatment strategies could reduce the incidence of preterm births in poor areas of the world that lack access to more sophisticated diagnostic methods.Copyright © 2019 Witkin et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659582>Age-related compositional and functional changes in micro-pig gut .</a></h2><p>Age-related changes in human gut  composition have been reported, and such changes might be influenced by the intake of nutrients or diets.

The micro-pigs were reared in a constantly controlled environment. The diversity of the gut  was found to continuously change with age. We also found associations between age and specific members and functions of the gut . Consistent with previous studies on the human gut , beneficial microbes including probiotic bacteria and short-chain fatty -producers decreased in older pigs, whereas Bacteroides increased with age. Based on the correlation network, Bacteroides seemed to have an important role in determining the relative abundances of other beneficial microbes. Our results suggest that maintaining beneficial gut microbes at a specific ratio corresponding to a certain age might contribute to a younger gut -age.

Monomeric flavan-3-ols are rapidly absorbed in the small intestine and released in the blood stream as phase II conjugates. Polymeric flavan-3-ols are extensively metabolized by colonic gut  into phenyl-γ-valerolactones and their related phenylvaleric . These molecules are the main circulating metabolites in humans after the ingestion of flavan-3-ol rich-products; nevertheless, they have received less attention and their role is not understood yet. Here, we describe the quantification of 8 phenyl-γ-valerolactones and 3 phenylvaleric  in the urine of 11 subjects on consumption of apples by using UHPLC-ESI-Triple Quad-MS with pure reference compounds. Phenyl-γ-valerolactones, mainly as sulfate and glucuronic  conjugates, reached maximum excretion between 6 and 12 after apple consumption, with a decline thereafter. Significant differences were detected in the cumulative excretion rates within subjects and in the ratio of dihydroxyphenyl-γ-valerolactone sulfate to glucuronide conjugates.

Once stimulated, these cells activate specialized structures such as Toll-like receptor and Nod-like receptor (NLR). By detecting danger-associated molecules, these receptors can set in motion major innate immunity pathways such as nuclear factor ĸB (NF-ĸB) and NLRP3 inflammasome, causing metabolic reprogramming and phenotype changes of immune and parenchymal cells and triggering the secretion of a number of inflammatory mediators that can cause irreversible tissue damage and functional loss. Growing evidence suggests that this response can be deeply impacted by the crosstalk between the kidneys and other organs, such as the gut. Changes in the composition and/or metabolite production of the gut  can influence inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis, thus offering opportunities to positively manipulate the composition and/or functionality of gut  and, consequentially, ameliorate deleterious consequences of renal diseases. In this review, we summarize the most recent evidence that renal inflammation can be ameliorated by interfering with the gut  through the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics. In addition to these innovative approaches, we address the recent discovery of new targets for drugs long in use in clinical practice. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, NF-ĸB inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and antimetabolic drugs can reduce renal macrophage infiltration and slow down the progression of renal disease by mechanisms independent of those usually attributed to these compounds. Allopurinol, an inhibitor of uric  production, has been shown to decrease renal inflammation by limiting activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. So far, these protective effects have been shown in experimental studies only. Clinical studies will establish whether these novel strategies can be incorporated into the arsenal of treatments intended to prevent the progression of human disease.Copyright © 2019 Andrade-Oliveira, Foresto-Neto, Watanabe, Zatz and Câmara.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635738>Chain conformation, physicochemical properties of fucosylated chondroitin sulfate from sea cucumber Stichopus chloronotus and its in vitro fermentation by human gut .</a></h2><p>This study investigated the chain conformation, physicochemical properties of fucosylated chondroitin sulfate from Stichopus chloronotus (fCS-Sc) using HPSEC-MALLS and worm-like cylinder model methods and its impact on human gut  by 16s RNA gene sequencing.

However, chronic treatment with GCs in clinical settings has a series of side effects, such as metabolic disorders, gut  dysbiosis and neurological impairment. Therefore, searching for a functional substance that can alleviate these side effects is greatly meaningful to clinical patients. Crocin is the main active ingredient of saffron, which has been reported to have numerous pharmacological activities. However, the action of crocin-I, one major member of the crocin family, on the physiological mediation in the individuals receiving GC treatment remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of crocin-I on lipid metabolism and the gut  in a mouse model of chronic corticosterone (CORT) treatment. Our findings showed that crocin-I reduced the levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol and the ratio of low density lipoprotein to high density lipoprotein in the serum of CORT-treated mice. In addition, transcriptome analysis revealed that crocin-I was effective in mediating the amelioration of lipid metabolism, mainly in fatty  metabolism and steroid biosynthesis in CORT-treated mice. Moreover, metabolome analysis demonstrated that crocin-I could restore the disturbed metabolites in the liver of CORT-treated mice, most of which are long-chain fatty . Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing of 16s rRNA revealed that crocin-I could mitigate the dysbiosis of the gut  caused by CORT at a dose of 40 mg kg-1, by resulting in a significant increase in the alpha diversity of the microbes in the cecal contents and a significant reduction in the abundance of Firmicutes, whereas by increasing the abundance of Bacteroidetes.

However, why different diets lead to similar diabetic states despite being associated with different  is not clear. Mice were fed two high-energy diets (HED) with the same energy density but different fat-to-sugar ratios to determine the associations between the  and early-stage metabolic syndrome. The two diets resulted in different  but similar diabetic states. Interestingly, the microbial gene profiles were not significantly different, and many common metabolites were identified, including l-aspartic , cholestan-3-ol (5β, 3α), and campesterol, which have been associated with lipogenesis and inflammation. Our study suggests that different metabolic-syndrome-inducing diets may result in different  but similar microbiomes and metabolomes. This suggests that the metagenome and metabolome are crucial for the prognosis and pathogenesis of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Various types of diet can lead to type 2 diabetes. The gut  in type 2 diabetic patients are also different. So, two questions arise: whether there are any commonalities between gut  induced by different pro-obese diets and whether these commonalities lead to disease.

Investigations have been accelerated through the application of mass spectrometry (MS)-based assays to quantitatively assess the concentration of these metabolites in laboratory- and animal-based experiments, as well as for direct circulating measurements in clinical research populations. This review seeks to explore the impact of these metabolites on disease, as well as to introduce the application of MS for those less accustomed to its use as a clinical tool, highlighting pertinent research related to its use for measurements of gut bacteria-mediated metabolites to further understand their associations with disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622696>The gut-liver axis in liver disease: pathophysiological basis for therapy.</a></h2><p>The gut-liver axis refers to the bidirectional relationship between the gut and its , and the liver, resulting from the integration of signals generated by dietary, genetic and environmental factors. This reciprocal interaction is established through the vascular route of the portal vein that carries gut-derived products directly to the liver, and the liver feed-back route of bile and antibody secretion to the intestine. The intestinal mucosal and vascular barrier is the functional and anatomical structure that serves as a playground for the interactions between the gut and the liver, limiting the systemic dissemination of microbes and toxins while allowing nutrients to access the circulation and to reach the liver. The control of microbial communities is critical to maintain homeostasis of the gut-liver axis, and as part of the two-way communication the liver shapes intestinal microbial communities. Alcohol disrupts the gut-liver axis at multiple interconnected levels, including the gut , mucus, epithelial barrier and antimicrobial peptides production, which increases the microbial exposure and the pro-inflammatory environment of the liver. Growing evidences indicate the pathogenetic role of microbe-derived metabolites, such as trimethylamine, secondary bile , SCFA and ethanol, in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Cirrhosis by itself is associated to profound alterations in gut  and damage at the different levels of defense of the intestinal barrier, including the epithelial, the vascular and the immune barriers. The relevance of the severe disturbance of the intestinal barrier in cirrhosis has been linked to translocation of live bacteria, bacterial infections and disease progression. The identification of the elements of the gut-liver axis primarily damaged in each chronic liver disease offers possibilities to intervention. Beyond antibiotics, upcoming therapies centered in the gut include new generations of probiotics, bacterial metabolites (postbiotics), fecal microbial transplantation, and carbon nanoparticles. FXR-agonists target both the gut and the liver and are currently being tested in different liver diseases. Finally, synthetic biotic medicines, phages that target specific bacteria or therapies that create physical barriers between the gut and the liver offer new approaches of treatment.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

It was found that treatment with JGT or 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) alleviated the severity of colitis symptoms by suppressing inflammatory cytokine levels of IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-γ. The non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis of gut  revealed that JGT groups were clearly separated from the DSS group, suggesting that JGT administration altered gut . The operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were decreased by DSS but increased by JGT include  and . On the other hand, OTUs that were increased by DSS but decreased by 5-ASA or JGT treatments include Bacteroidales S24-7, Ruminococcaceae, and Rikenellaceae, and the genera , , , and . After JGT administration, the metabolites, including most amino  and lactic  that were altered by colitis induction, became similar to those of the control group.

Several interventions are available for the management of patients with IBS, but no universal management algorithm currently exists. The aim of this article is to review interventions that may be considered in the management of patients with IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D). Nonpharmacological interventions include dietary and lifestyle modification, which are generally used as first-line therapy. Probiotics have demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with IBS, but studies are inconsistent in strains examined, dosing, and treatment duration. Psychological therapies (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnotherapy) also may improve IBS symptoms. Pharmacological interventions for the management of IBS-D include the US Food and Drug Administration-approved agents eluxadoline, rifaximin, and alosetron, as well as loperamide, smooth muscle antispasmodics, bile  sequestrants, and antidepressants (i.e. tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Eluxadoline and rifaximin have been shown to improve abdominal pain and stool consistency in patients with IBS-D. In addition, data indicate that alosetron improves IBS symptoms; however, it is approved only for women with severe IBS-D. Of the three approved agents, rifaximin has the most favorable safety profile. The risk-benefit ratio is an important consideration with every medication, but is especially important in the treatment of functional GI disorders such as IBS-D. Thus, the most troublesome symptoms, quality of life, symptom intensity, and individual patient preferences should be considered when formulating a management plan for patients with IBS-D.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591345>The Role of Dietary Fiber in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients: A Feasibility Study.</a></h2><p>Short-chain fatty  are microbial metabolites that have been shown to be key regulators of the gut-joint axis in animal models. In humans, microbial dysbiosis was observed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients as well as in those at-risk to develop RA, and is thought to be an environmental trigger for the development of clinical disease. At the same time, diet has a proven impact on maintaining intestinal microbial homeostasis. Given this association, we performed a feasibility study in RA patients using high-fiber dietary supplementation with the objective to restore microbial homeostasis and promote the secretion of beneficial immunomodulatory microbial metabolites. RA patients ( = 36) under routine care received daily high-fiber bars or cereals for 28 days. Clinical assessments and laboratory analysis of immune parameters in blood and stool samples from RA patients were done before and after the high-fiber dietary supplementation. We observed an increase in circulating regulatory T cell numbers, favorable Th1/Th17 ratios, as well as decreased markers of bone erosion in RA patients after 28 days of dietary intervention. Furthermore, patient-related outcomes of RA improved. Based on these results, we conclude that controlled clinical studies of high-fiber dietary interventions could be a viable approach to supplement or complement current pharmacological treatment strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624591>Low-protein diets supplemented with casein hydrolysate favor the  and enhance the mucosal humoral immunity in the colon of pigs.</a></h2><p>High-protein diets can increase the colonic health risks. A moderate reduction of dietary crude-protein (CP) level can improve the colonic bacterial community and mucosal immunity of pigs. However, greatly reducing the dietary CP level, even supplemented with all amino  (AAs), detrimentally affects the colonic health, which may be due to the lack of protein-derived peptides. Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of supplementation of casein hydrolysate (peptide source) in low-protein (LP) diets, in comparison with AAs supplementation, on the colonic , microbial metabolites and mucosal immunity in pigs, aiming to determine whether a supplementation of casein hydrolysate can improve colonic health under very LP level. Twenty-one pigs (initial BW 19.90 ± 1.00 kg, 63 ± 1 days of age) were assigned to three groups and fed with control diet (16% CP), LP diets (13% CP) supplemented with free AAs (LPA) or casein hydrolysate (LPC) for 4 weeks.Compared with control diet, LPA and LPC diet decreased the relative abundance of  and , and LPC diet further decreased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria. LPC diet also increased the relative abundance of . Both LP diets decreased concentrations of ammonia and cadaverine, and LPC diet also reduced concentrations of putrescine, phenol and indole. Moreover, LPC diet increased total short-chain fatty  concentration. In comparison with control diet, both LP diets decreased protein expressions of Toll-like receptor-4, nuclear factor-κB, interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, and LPC diet further decreased protein expressions of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein-1 and interferon-γ. LPC diet also increased protein expressions of G-protein coupled receptor-43, interleukin-4, transforming growth factor-β, immunoglobulin A and mucin-4, which are indicators for mucosal defense activity.The results showed that supplementing casein hydrolysate showed beneficial effects on the colonic  and mucosal immunity and barrier function in comparison with supplementing free AAs in LP diets. These findings may provide new framework for future nutritional interventions for colon health in pigs.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623188>Adjuvant Strategies for Lactic  Bacterial Mucosal Vaccines.</a></h2><p>Lactic  bacteria (LAB) are Gram-positive, -tolerant bacteria that have long been used in food fermentation and are generally recognized as safe (GRAS). LAB are a part of a normal  and act as probiotics, improving the gastrointestinal  and health when consumed. An increasing body of research has shown the importance of the  on both mucosal immune heath and immune response to pathogens and oral vaccines. Currently, there are few approved mucosal vaccines, and most are attenuated viruses or bacteria, which necessitates cold chain, carries the risk of reversion to virulence, and can have limited efficacy in individuals with poor mucosal health. On account of these limitations, new types of mucosal vaccine vectors are necessary. There has been increasing interest and success in developing recombinant LAB as next generation mucosal vaccine vectors due to their natural  and bile resistance, stability at room temperature, endogenous activation of innate and adaptive immune responses, and the development of molecular techniques that allow for manipulation of their genomes. To enhance the immunogenicity of these LAB vaccines, numerous adjuvant strategies have been successfully employed. Here, we review these adjuvant strategies and their mechanisms of action which include: Toll-like receptor ligands, secretion of bacterial toxins, secretion of cytokines, direct delivery to antigen presenting cells, and enterocyte targeting. The ability to increase the immune response to LAB vaccines gives them the potential to be powerful mucosal vaccine vectors against mucosal pathogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586017>Decreased ω6/ω3 PUFA ratio attenuates ethanol-induced alterations in intestinal homeostasis,  and liver injury.</a></h2><p>Ethanol-induced alterations in intestinal homeostasis lead to multi-system pathologies, including liver injury.  w6-PUFAs exert pro-inflammatory activity, while ω3-PUFAs promote anti-inflammatory activity that is mediated, in part, through specialized pro-resolving mediators (e.g. RvD1).  We tested the hypothesis that a decrease in ω6/ω3 PUFA ratio would attenuate ethanol-mediated alterations in the gut-liver axis.  fat-1 mice, which endogenously increase w3-PUFA levels, were protected against ethanol-mediated down-regulation of intestinal tight junction proteins in organoid cultures and in vivo.  Ethanol and LPS-induced expression of INF-g, Il-6, and Cxcl1 was attenuated in fat-1 and WT RvD1-treated mice. RNA-seq of ileum tissue revealed up-regulation of several genes involved in cell proliferation and stem cell renewal, and anti-microbial defense (including Alpi and Leap2) in fat-1 vs WT mice fed ethanol.  fat-1 mice were also resistant to ethanol-mediated down-regulation of genes important for xenobiotic/bile  detoxification.  Further, gut  and plasma metabolomics revealed several changes in fat-1 vs. WT mice that may contribute to a reduced inflammatory response.  Finally, these data correlated with a significant reduction in liver injury.  Our study suggests that w3-PUFA enrichment or treatment with resolvins can attenuate the disruption in alcohol-induced intestinal homeostasis caused by ethanol consumption and systemic inflammation with a concomitant reduction in liver injury.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654895>Protective properties of milk sphingomyelin against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation.</a></h2><p>The identification of natural bioactive compounds aimed at promoting optimal gut health and improving lipid metabolism is paramount in the prevention of chronic disease. In this review, we summarize basic science and clinical research examining the protective properties of milk sphingomyelin (SM) against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. Dietary SM dose-dependently reduces the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, triglycerides, and fatty  in cell culture and rodent studies. Overall, rodent feeding studies show dietary milk SM, milk polar lipid mixtures, and milk fat globule membrane reduce serum and hepatic lipid concentrations. Furthermore, these hypolipidemic effects are observed in some supplementation studies in humans, although the extent of reductions in serum cholesterol is typically smaller and only one trial was conducted with purified SM. Dietary milk SM has been reported to affect the gut  in rodent studies and its hydrolytic product, sphingosine, displays bactericidal activity in vitro. Milk SM may also improve gut barrier function to prevent the translocation of inflammatory gut bacteria-derived molecules. Current evidence from pre-clinical studies indicates that dietary milk SM has protective properties against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. The hypolipidemic effects of milk SM observed in animal studies have been reported in some human studies, although the magnitude of such effects is typically smaller. More research is warranted to clearly define how dietary milk SM influences lipid metabolism, gut , and inflammation in humans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Associations between the mycobiome and bacteriome in the piglet gut, in the context of weaning, remain unknown. Weaning is a time of significant stress, dietary changes, microbial alterations, and a predisposition to infection. The loss of animal health and growth makes potential microbial interventions of interest to the swine industry. Recent studies have demonstrated the diversity and development of the  in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of piglets during weaning, resulting from the dietary and physiological changes. Despite these advances, the role of the mycobiota in piglet health and its contribution to overall  development remains mostly unknown. In this study we investigated the bacteriome and the mycobiome after weaning in the GI tract organs and feces from 35-day old piglets. Following weaning, the α-diversity and amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) counts of the bacteriome increased, proximally to distally, from the stomach to the feces along the GI tract, while the mycobiome α-diversity and ASV counts were highest in the porcine stomach. β-diversity analyses show distinct clusters based on organ type in the bacteriome and mycobiome, but dispersion remained relatively constant in the mycobiome between organ/fecal sites. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Epsilonbacteraeota were the most abundant bacterial phyla present in the GI tract and feces based on mean taxonomic composition with high variation of composition found in the stomach. In the mycobiome, the dominant phyla were Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, and the stomach mycobiome did not demonstrate the same high level of variation observed in the bacteriome.

We selected studies that provided data on SCFA levels or fecal  abundance in obese and nonobese individuals and then combined the published estimates using a random-effects meta-analysis. Obese individuals had significantly higher fecal concentrations of acetate (SMD (standardized mean differences) = 0.87, 95% CI (confidence interva) = 0.24-1.50,  (-squared) = 88.5), propionate (SMD = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.35-1.36,  = 82.3%), and butyrate (SMD = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.29-1.27,  = 81.7%) than nonobese controls. The subgroup analyses showed no evidence of heterogeneity among obese individuals with a BMI >30 kg/m ( = 0.0%). At the phylum level, the abundance of fecal  was reduced in obese compared to nonobese individuals, but the difference was not statistically significant (Bacteroidetes phylum, SMD = -0.36, 95% CI = -0.73-0.01; Firmicutes phylum, SMD = -0.10, 95% CI = -0.31-0.10). The currently available human case-control studies show that obesity is associated with high levels of SCFA but not gut  richness at the phylum level. Additional well-designed studies with a considerable sample size are needed to clarify whether this association is causal, but it is also necessary to identify additional contributors to SCFA production, absorption, and excretion in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680542>[The physiological role of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factors].</a></h2><p>The existence of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) was recognized in connection with the stimulation of sulfate incorporation into cartilage. IGFs take part in the embryonal development and postnatal growth, in interaction with the growth hormone (GH). The physiological effects of IGF1 are promotion of tissue growth and development, stimulation of cell proliferation, effects on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, anabolic, anti-oxidant, neuro- and hepatoprotective properties. Our knowledge about the GH/IGF axis is diverse, partly contradictory, their research is continued intensively nowadays. We considered it worthwhile to review and interpret this information. Study on GH/IGF medical reports, with particular reference to the less known metabolic control. 75% of the growth factors are produced in the liver by GH and insulin stimulation; their effects are expressed on specific receptors, and modified by specific binding proteins. IGF1 directly increases the muscle mass, bone density, and the structure of the bones. Intestinal  induces secretion of IGF1, which promotes the development and remodeling of the bones. Short-chain fatty , produced in microbial fermented fibers, induce secretion of IGF1, suggesting that microbial activity also affects bone health  IGF1. IGF1 also has a direct and indirect glucose-lowering effect, enhances free fatty  oxidation in the muscle, reducing the flow of free fatty  into the liver, improving insulin signaling, resulting in the reduction of hepatic glucose output, and improves insulin sensitivity. IGF1 directly influences the expression of circadian BMAL1 in hypothalamic cells: this refers to the newly recognized 'zeitgeber' role of IGF1. The bioactivity of insulin-like peptides in the brain is characterized by neuronal survival, excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, maintenance of normal free fatty  levels, improvement of cognitive function, protection against cell damage, neurogenesis and angiogenesis. The effects of IGF2 are less outlined, however, it has a relevant role in the development of the fetus, and acts protectively on the brain. Lack or over-expression of IGF1 can be detected or may causally associated in many pathological conditions. According to these collected data, insulin sensitivity may be improved by different pathways. The role of IGFs in these processes should be a task of future research.

R. gnavus is part of the healthy gut  in humans, but it is disproportionately represented in diseases. There is therefore a need to understand the molecular mechanisms that underpin the adaptation of R. gnavus to the gut. Previous in vitro research has demonstrated that the mucin-glycan-foraging strategy of R. gnavus is strain dependent and is associated with the expression of an intramolecular trans-sialidase, which releases 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac, rather than Neu5Ac, from mucins. Here, we unravelled the metabolism pathway of 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac in R. gnavus that is underpinned by the exquisite specificity of the sialic transporter for 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac and by the action of an oxidoreductase that converts 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac into Neu5Ac, which then becomes a substrate of a Neu5Ac-specific aldolase. Having generated an R. gnavus nan-cluster deletion mutant that lost the ability to grow on sialylated substrates, we showed that-in gnotobiotic mice colonized with R. gnavus wild-type (WT) and mutant strains-the fitness of the nan mutant was significantly impaired, with a reduced ability to colonize the mucus layer. Overall, we revealed a unique sialic  pathway in bacteria that has important implications for the spatial adaptation of mucin-foraging gut symbionts in health and disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624009>Nutritional and dietary strategy in the clinical care of inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease have been increasing for decades and IBD has become a worldwide disease. Epidemiology studies demonstrated higher incidence rates in the more westernized countries. The change of habitual diets in these countries is perceived as the reason for the development of IBD. Besides, molecular biological studies showed some pathogenic substances produced after digestion of daily diet decrease the diversity of intestinal  and cause dysbiosis of . Then, chronic inflammation occurs in some genetically susceptible subjects and IBD developed. As a result, many researchers started to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of nutrients and dietary intervention on the clinical course and pathogenesis of IBD. Carbohydrates, fats, proteins and fibers are investigated and their molecular roles in the inflammatory process are discovered gradually. The undigested carbohydrates are proved to cause overgrowth of colonic bacteria and inflammation occurs by altering colonic . ω-3 poly-unsaturated fatty  are more favored over ω-6 poly-unsaturated fatty  due to its less pro-inflammatory properties. High fibers produce more short-chain fatty  in colon and facilitate the diversity of colonic . Moreover, some dietary interventions were designed and studied with promising results. Low FODMAP is recommended in IBS and is also suggested in patients of IBD with IBS-like symptoms. Specific Carbohydrate Diet was designed for celiac disease at first and is proved to be effective to decrease inflammation and to induce remission by decreasing non-digested carbohydrates into colon. Exclusive Enteral Nutrition has been investigated and is suggested to be the first line of management in pediatric CD in many literatures. Paleolithic diet and semi-vegetarian diet are evaluated and might be beneficial in some clinical settings. These findings are promising but limited to the evidence without high quality level. Some more well-designed studies with randomization and double-blind are needed and the primary endpoints should be more focused on the decrease of inflammation in pathology and mucosal healing in endoscopy instead of relief of the symptoms.Copyright © 2019.

Particularly, root exudation is one of the most important plant-associated processes in this respect, as it may have a substantial effect on the bioavailability of soil contaminants, specially of hydrophobic contaminants strongly sorbed by soil. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of root exudates (natural and artificial) on the desorption of α-, β-, δ- and γ-isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) from contaminated soil, using batch experiments. Natural root exudates were obtained from Holcus lanatus plants growing in the same (contaminated) area. Fifteen compounds (mainly organic  and phenolic compounds) usually found in root exudates were also tested, individually or as mixtures (1 and 10 mM). Both natural and artificial exudates favoured the mobilization of sorbed HCH in soil. The effect was highly significant for α-, β- and γ-HCH isomers, for which the desorption rates increased by 23.0, 26.8 and 15.5% in the presence of natural root exudates and by 40.1, 25.9 and 25.6% in the presence of the artificial mixture (at 10 mM). The δ-HCH desorption rates increased by less than 10%. The effect of individual exudate components was very variable, but increased with the carbon content, reflecting the significance of hydrophobic interactions between the exudates and HCH molecules in the desorption of these last from soil. These findings indicate that plants may significantly influence the bioavailability of persistent contaminants, with major implications for improving phyto- and bioremediation procedures.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The lack of alternative antimicrobial strategies to control this disease is mainly due to limited insight into the relationship between NE pathogenesis, , and host responses. Here we showed that the microbial metabolic byproduct of secondary bile  deoxycholic  (DCA), at as low as 50 µM, inhibited 82.8% of C. perfringens growth in Tryptic Soy Broth (P < 0.05). Sequential Eimeria maxima and C. perfringens challenges significantly induced NE, severe intestinal inflammation, and body weight (BW) loss in broiler chickens. These negative effects were diminished (P < 0.05) by 1.5 g/kg DCA diet. At the cellular level, DCA alleviated NE-associated ileal epithelial death and significantly reduced lamina propria cell apoptosis. Interestingly, DCA reduced C. perfringens invasion into ileum (P < 0.05) without altering the bacterial ileal luminal colonization. Molecular analysis showed that DCA significantly reduced inflammatory mediators of Infγ, Litaf, Il1β, and Mmp9 mRNA accumulation in ileal tissue. Mechanism studies revealed that C. perfringens induced (P < 0.05) elevated expression of inflammatory mediators of Infγ, Litaf, and Ptgs2 (Cyclooxygenases-2 (COX-2) gene) in chicken splenocytes. Inhibiting the COX signaling by aspirin significantly attenuated INFγ-induced inflammatory response in the splenocytes. Consistent with the in vitro assay, chickens fed 0.12 g/kg aspirin diet protected the birds against NE-induced BW loss, ileal inflammation, and intestinal cell apoptosis. In conclusion, microbial metabolic product DCA prevents NE-induced BW loss and ileal inflammation through attenuating inflammatory response. These novel findings of  protecting birds against NE provide new options on developing next generation antimicrobial alternatives against NE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682209>Integrating Autism Spectrum Disorder Pathophysiology: Mitochondria, Vitamin A, CD38, Oxytocin, Serotonin and Melatonergic Alterations in the Placenta and Gut.</a></h2><p>A diverse array of data has been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), reflecting the complexity of its pathophysiology as well as its heterogeneity. Two important hubs have emerged, the placenta/prenatal period and the postnatal gut, with alterations in mitochondria functioning crucial in both.Factors acting to regulate mitochondria functioning in ASD across development are reviewed in this article.Decreased vitamin A, and its retinoic  metabolites, lead to a decrease in CD38 and associated changes that underpin a wide array of data on the biological underpinnings of ASD, including decreased oxytocin, with relevance both prenatally and in the gut. Decreased sirtuins, poly-ADP ribose polymerase-driven decreases in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), hyperserotonemia, decreased monoamine oxidase, alterations in 14-3-3 proteins, microRNA alterations, dysregulated aryl hydrocarbon receptor activity, suboptimal mitochondria functioning, and decreases in the melatonergic pathways are intimately linked to this. Many of the above processes may be modulating, or mediated by, alterations in mitochondria functioning. Other bodies of data associated with ASD may also be incorporated within these basic processes, including how ASD risk factors such as maternal obesity and preeclampsia as well as more general prenatal stressors modulate the likelihood of offspring ASD.Such an integrated model of the pathophysiology of ASD has important preventative and treatment implications.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649637>Reduced Gut  Diversity and Metabolome Differences in Rhinoceros Species at Risk for Iron Overload Disorder.</a></h2><p>Iron overload disorder (IOD) affects many wildlife species cared for .

The goal of this study was to gain insight into these relationships within the family Rhinocerotidae. Specific objectives were to (1) characterize the gut  and metabolome of four rhinoceros species; (2) compare the  and metabolome of IOD-susceptible and IOD-resistant rhinoceros species; and (3) identify variation in the  and metabolome associated with compromised health or disease in IOD-susceptible rhinoceroses. Fecal samples were collected from 31 rhinoceroses (Sumatran rhinoceros,  = 3; black rhinoceros,  = 6; GOH rhinoceros,  = 9; white rhinoceros,  = 13) located at five facilities, and matched fecal aliquots were processed for  and metabolome analyses using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. Despite the phylogenetic disparity and dissimilar zoo diets of the hosts, the structure of the fecal  of the two IOD-susceptible rhinoceros species were more closely related to each other than to those of the two IOD-resistant species (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity; IOD-susceptible vs. IOD-resistant -value < 0.001). In addition, IOD-susceptible rhinoceroses exhibited less microbial diversity than their IOD-resistant relatives (Shannon diversity; -value < 0.001) which could have health implications. Of note, the black rhinoceros was distinct among the four rhinoceros species with the most divergent fecal metabolome; interestingly, it contained higher concentrations of short chain fatty . Neither age nor sex were associated with differences in microbial community composition ( = 0.253 and 0.488, respectively) or fecal metabolomic profile ( = 0.634 and 0.332, respectively). Differences in the distal gut microbiomes between IOD-resistant and IOD-susceptible rhinoceroses support hypotheses that gut microbes play a role in host iron acquisition, and further studies and experiments to test these hypotheses are warranted.Copyright © 2019 Roth, Switzer, Watanabe-Chailland, Bik, Relman, Romick-Rosendale and Ollberding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612141>Administration of  KBL375 Causes Taxonomic and Functional Changes in Gut  Leading to Improvement of Atopic Dermatitis.</a></h2><p>Gut  play an important role in immune responses and energy metabolism. In this study, we evaluated whether administration of  () KBL375 isolated from healthy Korean feces improves the atopic dermatitis using the house dust mite ()-induced atopic dermatitis (AD) mouse model. Administration of  KBL375 significantly decreased dermatitis score, ear and dorsal thickness, and serum immunoglobulin E level in AD-induced mice. Significant reductions in mast cells and eosinophils were discovered in skin tissues from  KBL375-treated mice. T helper 2 cell-related cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-31 significantly decreased, and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 or transforming growth factor-β increased in skin tissues from  KBL375-treated mice. In addition to phenotypic changes in skin tissues,  KBL375 treatment induced an increase in the CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cell population in mesenteric lymph nodes. Taxonomic and functional analyses of gut  showed significantly higher cecum bacterial diversities and abundances including genus , and  in  KBL375-treated mice. Metabolic analysis of the cecum also showed significant changes in the levels of various amino  including methionine, phenylalanine, serine, and tyrosine, as well as short chain fatty  such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate in AD-induced mice due to  KBL375 treatment. These altered metabolites in AD-induced mice returned to the levels similar to those in control mice when treated with  KBL375. Therefore,  KBL375 could be useful for AD treatment by modulating the immune system and inducing various metabolites.Copyright © 2019 Kim, Jang, Han, Seo, Park, Lee and Ko.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620118>Dietary Fiber-Induced Microbial Short Chain Fatty  Suppress ILC2-Dependent Airway Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Group 2 Innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) contribute significantly to allergic inflammation. However, the role of  on ILC2s remains to be unraveled. Here we show that short chain fatty  (SCFAs), such as butyrate, derived from fermentation of dietary fibers by the gut  inhibit pulmonary ILC2 functions and subsequent development of airway hyperreactivity (AHR). We further show that SCFAs modulate GATA3, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolytic metabolic pathways in pulmonary ILC2s. The observed phenotype is associated with increased IL-17a secretion by lung ILC2s and linked to enhanced neutrophil recruitment to the airways. Finally, we show that butyrate-producing gut bacteria in germ-free mice effectively suppress ILC2-driven AHR. Collectively, our results demonstrate a previously unrecognized role for microbial-derived SCFAs on pulmonary ILC2s in the context of AHR. The data suggest strategies aimed at modulating metabolomics and  in the gut, not only to treat, but to prevent lung inflammation and asthma.Copyright © 2019 Lewis, Wang, Shafiei Jahani, Hurrell, Banie, Aleman Muench, Maazi, Howard, Galle-Treger, Lo, Santosh, Baltus, Bongers, San-Mateo, Gilliland, Rehan, Soroosh and Akbari.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591555>Escherichia coli limits Salmonella Typhimurium infections after diet shifts and fat-mediated  perturbation in mice.</a></h2><p>The  confers colonization resistance, which blocks Salmonella gut colonization.

In this study, the effect of Holothuria leucospilota polysaccharide (HLP) on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was investigated in Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats. The results showed that HLP significantly improved glucose intolerance and regulated blood lipid and hormone levels (p < 0.05). Pathological analysis showed that HLP repaired the impairments of the pancreas and colon in diabetic rats. In addition, a high dose of HLP (200 mg/kg) significantly upregulated the gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (PKB/AKT), glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2), and downregulated the mRNA levels of pro-apoptotic (Bax) and cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) in diabetic rats (p < 0.05). Furthermore, HLP treatment increased the short-chain fatty -producing bacteria and decreased the opportunistic bacterial pathogen in the feces of diabetic rats.

What constitutes a unique feature of this model is its twofold objective of introducing an ileal microbial community and mimicking a dietary weaning transition. This model should then be ideally suited to test the dietary weaning strategies of piglets in vitro. Regarding the , the main phyla making up the model were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria although Bacteroidetes decreased after inoculation (p = 0.043 in ileum, p = 0.021 in colon) and Delta-Proteobacteria were favoured (p = 0.083 in ileum, p = 0.043 in colon) compared to Gamma-Proteobacteria. The designed model led to a low representation of Bacilli - especially Lactobacillus sp. in the ileum and a weak representation of Bacteroidia in the proximal colon. However, Mitsuokella and Prevotella were part of the major genera of the model along with Bifidobacterium, Fusobacterium, Megasphaera and Bacteroides. As a result of weaning, two major changes - normally occurring in vivo - were detected in the system: firstly, Firmicutes diminished when Bacteroidetes increased particularly in the proximal colon; secondly, Bacteroides decreased and Prevotella increased (mean value for four runs). In terms of metabolite production, while a ratio acetate: propionate: butyrate of 60:26:14 was obtained in post-weaned colon, the expected inversion of the ratio propionate: butyrate in the post-weaned ileum was unfortunately not observed. To conclude, the so-called baby-SPIME model meets expectations regarding the resident  of the proximal colon bioreactor and the metabolites produced thereof. In terms of the evolution of major groups of bacteria, the in vitro weaning process appeared to be successful. However, higher concentration of butyric  would have been expected in ileum part of newly weaned piglets, as observed in vivo. The  in the ileum bioreactor seemed in fact to act like a pre-colon. This suggests that microbial profile in ileum bioreactor had to be improved.Copyright © 2019.

Therefore, we sought to characterize the bacterial succession during the vermicomposting of grape marc over a period of 91 days in a pilot-scale vermireactor. Samples were taken at the initiation of vermicomposting, and days 14, 28, 42, and 91, representing both active and mature stages of vermicomposting. By using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing, significant changes in the bacterial community composition of grape marc were found after 14 days and throughout the process ( < 0.0001). There was also an increase in bacterial diversity, both taxonomic and phylogenetic, from day 14 until the end of the trial. We found the main core  comprised of twelve bacterial taxa (~16.25% of the total sequences) known to be capable of nitrogen fixation and to confer plant-disease suppression. Accordingly, functional diversity included increases in specific genes related to nitrogen fixation and synthesis of plant hormones (salicylic ) after 91 days. Together, the findings support the use of grape marc vermicompost for sustainable practices in the wine industry by disposing of this high-volume winery by-product and capturing its value to improve soil fertility.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608045>Antimicrobial Activity of Cinnamaldehyde on  Biofilms.</a></h2><p> is considered the most relevant bacteria in the transition of non-pathogenic commensal oral  to biofilms which contribute to the dental caries process. The present study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of a natural plant product, cinnamaldehyde against  biofilms. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), and growth curves were determined to assess its antimicrobial effect against planktonic . The biofilm biomass and metabolism with different concentrations of cinnamaldehyde and different incubation time points were assessed using the crystal violet and MTT assays. The biofilms were visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Bacterial cell surface hydrophobicity, aggregation,  production, and  tolerance were evaluated after cinnamaldehyde treatment. The gene expression of virulence-related factors (, , , , , , ,  and ) was investigated by real-time PCR. The MIC and MBC of cinnamaldehyde against planktonic  were 1000 and 2000 μg/mL, respectively. The results showed that cinnamaldehyde can decrease biofilm biomass and metabolism at sub-MIC concentrations. CLSM images revealed that the biofilm-covered surface areas decreased with increasing concentrations of cinnamaldehyde. Cinnamaldehyde increased cell surface hydrophobicity, reduced  aggregation, inhibited  production, and  tolerance. Genes expressions in the biofilms were down-regulated in the presence of cinnamaldehyde. Therefore, our data demonstrated that cinnamaldehyde at sub-MIC level suppressed the microbial activity on  biofilm by modulating hydrophobicity, aggregation,  production,  tolerance, and virulence gene expression.Copyright © 2019 He, Huang, Jiang and Zhou.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638838>Nutritional factors influencing plasma adiponectin levels: results from a randomised controlled study with whole-grain cereals.</a></h2><p>Data from intervention studies about the effects of a high intake of whole-grain cereals on adiponectin expression are still inconclusive. We evaluated the effects of whole-grain or refined cereals on fasting and postprandial serum adiponectin in people at high cardiovascular risk. According to a randomised controlled parallel group design, participants with metabolic syndrome were assigned to an isoenergetic diet based on either whole-grain cereal (WGC) or refined cereal (RC) products for 12-weeks. Anthropometric and biochemical measures were taken. Compared to baseline, fasting and postprandial serum adiponectin levels increased after both RC and WGC.

Scientific research has established that oats can improve diet quality, reduce cholesterol, regulate satiety, and protect against carcinogenesis in the colon; however, determining the effects of oats on gastrointestinal health and the gut  is a newer, evolving area of research. To better understand the effects of oats on gastrointestinal health in humans, a literature review with predefined search criteria was conducted using the PubMed database and keywords for common gastrointestinal health outcomes. Moreover, to examine the gastrointestinal effects of oats across the scientific spectrum, a similar search strategy was executed to identify animal studies. In vitro studies were identified from the reference lists of human and animal studies. A total of 8 human studies, 19 animal studies, and 5 in vitro studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. The evidence in humans shows beneficial effects of oats on gastrointestinal health, with supportive evidence provided by in vitro and animal studies. The effective dose of oats varies by type, although an amount providing 2.5 to 2.9 g of β-glucan per day was shown to decrease fecal pH and alter fecal bacteria. For oat bran, 40 to 100 g/d was shown to increase fecal bacterial mass and short-chain fatty  in humans. Differences in study design, methodology, and type of oats tested make valid comparisons difficult. The identification of best practices for the design of oat studies should be a priority in future research, as the findings will be useful for determining how oats influence specific indices of gastrointestinal health, including the composition of the human gut .© The Author(s) 2019.

Some fungal species are commensal organisms that are part of the normal human , and, as such, do not pose a threat to the immune system. However, when the natural balance of this association is disturbed or the host's immune system is compromised, these fungal pathogens overtake the organism, and cause IFI. To understand the invasiveness of these pathogens and to address the growing problem of IFI, it is essential to identify the cellular processes of the invading organism and their virulence. In this review, we will discuss the prevalence and current options available to treat IFI, including recent reports of drug resistance. Nevertheless, the main focus of this review is to describe the glycobiology of human fungal pathogens and how various components of the fungal cell wall, particularly cell wall polysaccharides and glycoconjugates, are involved in fungal pathogenicity, their biosynthesis and how they can be potentially exploited to develop novel antifungal treatment options. We will specifically describe the nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) that are important in fungal survival and suggest that the inhibition of fungal NSTs may potentially be useful to prevent the establishment of fungal infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624005>Starch Digestion by Gut Bacteria: Crowdsourcing for Carbs.</a></h2><p>Starch is a polymer of glucose and is one of the most abundant carbohydrates in a Western diet. Resistant starch escapes digestion by host small intestinal glucoamylases and transits the colon where it is degraded by the combined efforts of many gut bacteria. Bacterial metabolism and fermentation of resistant starch leads to increases in short-chain fatty , including the clinically beneficial butyrate. Here, we review the molecular machinery that gut bacteria use to degrade starch and how these functions may intersect to facilitate complete starch digestion. While the protein complexes that gut bacteria use to degrade starch differ across phyla, some molecular details converge to promote the optimal positioning of enzymes and substrate for starch degradation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent studies provided strong evidence that autophagy plays a key role in the etiology of Crohn's disease (CD). Probiotics may exhibit many therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory abilities. While successful results have been obtained in ulcerative colitis patients, probiotics remain inefficient in CD for unknown reason. It remains therefore important to better understand their molecular mechanisms of action.The activation of autophagy was examined by stimulating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by the bacteria, followed by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis. The impact of blocking in vitro autophagy was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using 3-methyl adenine or bafilomycin followed by cytokine secretion measurement by ELISA. The role of autophagy in the anti-inflammatory capacities of the bacterial strains was evaluated in vivo using an acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic -induced murine model of colitis. The impact of BMDC was evaluated by adoptive transfer, notably using bone marrow cells derived from autophagy-related 16-like 1-deficient mice.We showed that selected lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are able to induce autophagy activation in BMDCs. Blocking in vitro autophagy abolished the capacity of the strains to induce the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, while it exacerbated the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β. We confirmed in the TNBS-induced mouse model of colitis that autophagy is involved in the protective capacity of these selected strains, and showed that dendritic cells are involved in this process.We propose autophagy as a novel mechanism involved in the regulatory capacities of probiotics.© Copyright by the Author(s).

Nostoc commune Vaucher (N. commune) has always been appreciated as a healthy food and supplementation worldwide as it is rich in nutrients. Particularly, polysaccharides account for 60% of the dry weight of N. commune. In this study, we examined the protective effects of the polysaccharides isolated from N. commune (NVPS) against colitis-associated colon tumorigenesis in mice treated with azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) and the impact of these polysaccharides on the intestinal . NVPS were administered to mice through an intragastric gavage for 14 weeks. Our results demonstrated that the treatment with NVPS significantly decreased the number and sizes of tumors and reduced the incidence of intestinal tumors. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and qPCR, we analyzed the bacterial composition of the fecal samples obtained from mice. The results demonstrated that the alterations in the abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes caused by the AOM/DSS treatment were significantly reversed in response to the NVPS treatment. Moreover, the short-chain fatty  (SCFA)-producing genera, including butyric -producing genera (Butyricicoccus, Butyrivibrio and Butyricimonas) and acetic -producing genera (Lachnospiraceae UCG 001, Lachnospiraceae UCG 006, and Blautia), were drastically enriched following the NVPS intervention. These compositional alterations induced by the NVPS were associated with the suppressed colonic inflammation and carcinogenesis.

This investigation focuses on resident  recovered from a hydrogeologically confined aquifer in fractured Paleozoic carbonate rocks at 863 - 923 meters below land surface. Analysis of the microorganisms living in this oligotrophic environment provides a perspective into microbial metabolic strategies required to endure prolonged hydrogeological isolation deep underground. Here we present a microbiological and physicochemical characterization of a deep continental carbonate ecosystem and describe a bacterial genus isolated from the ecosystem. Strain DRI-13 is a strictly anaerobic, moderately thermophilic, fumarate-respiring member of the phylum . This bacterium grows optimally at 55°C and pH 8.0, can tolerate a concentration of 100 mM NaCl, and appears to obligately metabolize fumarate to acetate and succinate. Culture-independent 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicates a global subsurface distribution, while the closest cultured relatives of DRI-13 are  (90.0% similarity) and  (88.0% similarity).

Two studies concerned VOC analysis in inflammatory bowel diseases, and the results showed that VOCs can distinguish active disease from remission; VOC profile is clearly different in patients. In particular, CH 1-pentadecene, 3-methyl-1-butanal, octane, acetic , alpha-pinene, and m-cymene are elevated in active ulcerative colitis. Four studies examined VOCs in gastric and colorectal tumors showing a change in metabolic biomarkers of cancer patients compared to the control group.

A relatively under-explored aspect of this is the role of gammaDelta (γδ) T cells, including prenatally and in the postnatal gut, which seem important hubs in driving the course of ASD.The present article looks at the role of γδ T cells in ASD, including via their interactions with other immune cells shown to be altered in this spectrum of conditions, including natural killer cells and mast cells.Other risk factors in ASD, such as decreased vitamins A & D, as well as toxin-associated activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor may also be intimately linked to γδ T cells, and alterations in the regulation of these cells. A growing body of data has highlighted an important role for alterations in mitochondria functioning in the regulation of immune cells, including natural killer cells and mast cells. This is an area that requires investigation in γδ T cells and their putative subtypes.It is also proposed that maternal stress may be acting via alterations in the maternal , leading to changes in how the balance of short chain fatty , such as butyrate, may act to regulate the placenta and developing foetus. Following an overview of previous research on immune, especially γδ T cells, effects in ASD, the future research implications are then detailed.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642785>Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome and Mycoplasma Pneumoniae infection: A Case Report analysis with a metabolomics approach.</a></h2><p>Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Disorder (PANS) is a clinical condition characterized by sudden and dramatic obsessive-compulsive disorder with a suggested post-infectious immune-mediated etiology. This condition is accompanied by an extensive series of relatively serious neuropsychiatric symptoms. The diagnosis of PANS is made by "exclusion", as the individual PANS symptoms overlap with a multiplicity of psychiatric disorders with onset in childhood. Several researchers accumulated evidence to support the hypothesis that PANS was closely associated with a variety of infections. In the last decade, metabolomics played an essential role in improving the knowledge of complex biological systems and identifying potential new biomarkers, as indicators of pathological progressions, or pharmacologic responses to therapy. The metabolome is considered the most predictive phenotype, capable to catch epigenetic differences, reflecting more closely the clinical reality at any given moment and thus providing extremely dynamic data. In the present work, we review the most recent hypothesis and suggested mechanisms of this condition and describe the case of a 10 year -year-old girl with PANS, before and after clarithromycin treatment. The main results of this case report are discussed from a metabolomics point of view. The alteration of several metabolic pathways concerning the microbial activity highlights the possible role of the  in the development of PANS. Furthermore, different metabolic perturbations at the level of the protein biosynthesis, energy and amino  metabolisms were observed and discussed. Based on our observations, we believe that metabolomics is a promising technology to unravel the mysteries of PANS in the near future.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662858>The gut virome in inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis: From metagenomics to novel therapeutic approaches.</a></h2><p>The association of intestinal dysbiosis with the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease has been well established.

Changes in human gut  and serum biochemical parameters during long-term isolation in a controlled ecological life support system (CELSS) are of great significance for maintaining the health of crewmembers.

A trade-off between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes during the study period was observed. Dynamic variations in the two dominant genus Bacteroides and Prevotella indicated a variation of enterotypes. Both the evenness and richness of the fecal  decreased during the isolation in the CELSS. Transition of diurnal circle from Earth to Mars increased the abundance of Fusobacteria phylum and decreased alpha diversity of the fecal . The levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the CELSS were significantly lower than those outside the CELSS.The unique isolation process in the CELSS led to a loss of alpha diversity and a transition of enterotypes between Bacteroides and Prevotella. Attention should therefore be paid to the transition of the diurnal circle and its effects on the gut  during manned Mars explorations. In particular, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels require monitoring under artificial light environments and during long-term space flight. Large-scale studies are required to further consolidate our findings.© 2019 Dong et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642142>Monitoring steady production of 1,3-Propanediol during bioprospecting of glycerol assimilating soil  using dye-based pH-stat method.</a></h2><p>In the present investigation a dye-based pH-stat method was devised for monitoring steady production of 1,3-Propanediol (1,3-PDO) during bioprospecting of glycerol assimilating soil .Soil samples were collected from two potential sites of CSIR-IIP, India. Selective enrichment of microbial consortia was done using the glycerol-based medium at initial stage, followed by purification to isolated colonies, after positive HPLC detection of 1,3-PDO in the fermentation broth. When the purified isolated were re-tested for 1,3-PDO production, only two isolates namely Isolate 1 and 3 were capable of producing the targeted product preferably under anaerobic conditions. On account of better 1,3-PDO fermentation efficiency (Isolate 3, 22% vs Isolate 1, 4.48%) and acetic  as the only major by-product, Isolate 3 was shortlisted for further studies. A dye based technique was devised in which bromothymol blue was incorporated in the medium to monitor the pH drop due to acetic  formation and hence change in color. Visual change in color helped in intermittent pH restoration. During fermentation, with pH stat being 8-8.5, Isolate 3 at 32°C yielded 0.67 mol mol 1,3-PDO within a short span of 12 h only with an initial concentration of glycerol being 20 g L . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Isolate 3 shared 95.8% homology with C. freundii CFNIH1 and hence designated as Citrobacter freundii IIP DR3.The present study demonstrated that during bioprospecting glycerol assimilating , dye-based technique can be successfully employed. This technique can further be exploited to monitor consistent production of all microbial secondary metabolites that accompanies  production.Incorporation of "Bromothymol blue" can visually help in the identification of pH drop in the medium, so that pH stat can be easily maintained during 1,3-PDO production from glycerol especially under shake flask conditions.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678751>Consecutive lactate formation and chain elongation to reduce exogenous chemicals input in repeated-batch food waste fermentation.</a></h2><p>The production of biochemicals from renewables through biorefinery processes is important to reduce the anthropogenic impact on the environment. Chain elongation processes based on microbiomes have been successfully developed to produce medium-chain fatty  (MCFA) from organic waste streams. Yet, the sustainability of chain elongation can still be improved by reducing the use of electron donors and additional chemicals. This work aimed to couple lactate production and subsequent chain elongation to decrease chemicals input such as electron donors and hydroxide for pH control in repeated-batch food waste fermentation. Food waste with adjusted pH was used as substrate and fermentation proceeded without pH control. During fermentation, lactate was first formed through the homolactic pathway and then converted to fatty  (FA), mainly n-butyrate and n-caproate. The highest n-caproate carbon selectivities (mmol C/mmol C) and production rates were 38% and 4.2 g COD/L-d, respectively. Hydroxide input was reduced over time to a minimum of 0.47 mol OH/mol MCFA or 0.79 mol OH/kg COD. Lactate was a key electron donor for chain elongation and its conversion was observed at pH as low as 4.3. The  enriched in this work was dominated by Lactobacillus spp. and Caproiciproducens spp. The high abundance of Caproiciproducens spp. and their co-occurrence with Lactobacillus spp. suggest Caproiciproducens spp. used lactate as electron donor for chain elongation. This work shows the production of n-caproate from food waste with decreased use of hydroxide and no use of exogenous electron donors.Copyright © 2019.

Accumulating evidence have suggested microgravity and simulated weightlessness could induce dysbiosis of intestinal , which may contribute to the bowel symptoms during spaceflight. However, the specific responses of intestinal metabolome under simulated weightlessness and its relationship with the intestinal  and immune characteristics remain largely unknown. In the current study, 20 adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into the control group and the simulated weightlessness group using a hindlimb unloading model. The metabolomic profiling of cecal contents from eight rats of each group was investigated by gas chromatography-time of flight/mass spectrometry. The significantly different metabolites, biomarkers, and related pathways were identified. Multivariate analysis, such as principal component analysis and orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis, demonstrated an obvious separation between the control group and the simulated weightlessness group. Significantly different metabolites, such as xylose, sinapinic , indolelactate, and digalacturonic , were identified, which participate in mainly pyrimidine metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and valine, leucine and isoleucine metabolism. Cytidine-5'-monophosphate, 4-hydroxypyridine, and phloretic  were determined as pivotal biomarkers under simulated weightlessness. Moreover, the significantly different metabolites were remarkably correlated with dysbiosis of the intestinal  and disturbance of immunological characteristics induced by simulated weightlessness. These metabolic features provide crucial candidates for therapeutic targets for metabolic disorders under weightlessness.Copyright © 2019 Jin, Wang, Zhang, Zhou and Zhao.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575408>Probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG prevents progesterone metabolite epiallaopregnanolone sulfate-induced hepatic bile  accumulation and liver injury.</a></h2><p>Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is gestation-specific liver disease associated with liver injury and increased serum and hepatic bile . Although the mechanism of ICP is still not fully understood, the reproductive hormones seem to play an important role. Recent studies show that a progesterone metabolite, epiallopregnanolone sulfate (PM5S), is supraphysiologically elevated in the serum of ICP patients, indicating it may play an etiology role in ICP. Bile  homeostasis is controlled by multiple mechanisms including farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-mediated bile  export and synthesis. It is known that cholic  (CA), a primary bile , can activate FXR, which is inhibited by PM5S, an FXR antagonist. Here we employed a mouse model of concurrent exposure of CA and PM5S-induced liver injury and determined the effects of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) in the prevention of the bile  disorders and liver injury. Mice challenged with CA + PM5S had significantly increased levels of serum and hepatic bile  and bilirubin and liver enzyme. Pretreatment with LGG significantly reduced bile  and bilirubin levels associated with reduced liver enzyme level and mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We also showed that the beneficial effects of LGG is likely mediated by hepatic FXR activation and bile salt export pump (BSEP) upregulation. In conclusion, our results provide a rationale for the application of probiotics in the management of ICP through gut -mediated FXR activation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We have previously demonstrated alterations in gut  composition and functions in patients with alcohol overconsumption, and now aimed to investigate possible associations between cytokine levels, gut  and clinical symptoms.We included hospital inpatients with a history of chronic alcohol overconsumption. For comparison, we included control patients with a low alcohol intake. Cytokine levels (TGF-β1, TNF-α, IL-10, IL-8, IL-6, IFN-γ, MCP-1, IL-1RA, IL-1β and IL-17) were determined using a customized V-plex assay. We then examined associations of cytokine levels with the abundance of Proteobacteria and Faecalibacterium, percentage of the short-chain fatty  butyrate, psychiatric symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and biochemical liver variables.We included 28 patients with alcohol overconsumption (79% men), and 25 control patients (72% men). Patients with alcohol overconsumption had higher levels of IL-6 (p = 0.002), IFN-γ (p = 0.018) and MCP-1 (p = 0.006), and lower levels of TGF-β1 (p = 0.017) compared with control patients. Inverse correlations were found between Proteobacteria abundance and TNF-α (R = -0.55, p = 0.02) and IL-8 (R = -0.58, p = 0.014), and between Faecalibacterium and MCP-1 levels (R = -0.56, p = 0.02) in the control patients, but not in patients with alcohol overconsumption. Patients with alcohol overconsumption reported more psychiatric symptoms, and these symptoms were inversely correlated with IL-10 levels. There were positive correlations between several of the assessed cytokines and biochemical liver variables, and negative correlations between cytokine levels and albumin.Patients with alcohol overconsumption had a cytokine profile suggestive of increased systemic inflammatory activity, with higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IFN-γ and MCP-1) and lower levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-β1).

Although it is known that increased synthetic fertilizer input in Chinese farmlands over the past 50 years has resulted in not only increased yields but also environmental problems, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how crops under elevated nutrient input shape root-associated microbial communities, especially through adjusting the quantities and compositions of root metabolites and exudates.The compositions of bacterial and fungal communities from the roots and rhizosphere of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under four levels of long-term inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilization were characterized at the tillering, jointing and ripening stages. The root-released organic carbon (ROC), organic  in the root exudates and soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil active carbon (SAC) in the rhizosphere were quantified.ROC levels varied dramatically across wheat growth stages and correlated more with the bacterial community than with the fungal community. Rhizosphere SOC and SAC levels were elevated by long-term N fertilization but varied only slightly across growth stages. Variation in the microbial community structure across plant growth stages showed a decreasing trend with N fertilization level in the rhizosphere. In addition, more bacterial and fungal genera were significantly correlated in the jointing and ripening stages than in the tillering stage in the root samples. A number of bacterial genera that shifted in response to N fertilization, including Arthrobacter, Bacillus and Devosia, correlated significantly with acetic , oxalic , succinic  and tartaric  levels.Our results indicate that both plant growth status and N input drive changes in the microbial community structure in the root zone of wheat. Plant growth stage demostrated a stronger influence on bacterial than on fungal community composition. A number of bacterial genera that have been described as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) responded positively to N fertilization, and their abundance correlated significantly with the organic  level, suggesting that the secretion of organic  may be a strategy developed by plants to recruit beneficial microbes in the root zone to cope with high N input.

This study explored the effects of different protein sources on the growth performance, diarrhea rate, apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of crude protein (CP), colonic mucin chemotypes, colonic , and microbial metabolites of piglets. Twenty-four piglets were randomly divided into four groups that received isoenergetic and isonitrogenous diets containing either Palbio 50 RD (P50), Soyppt-50% (S50), concentrated degossypolized cottonseed protein (CDCP), or fish meal (FM) as the sole protein source. The experimental diets did not affect the estimated daily gain (EDG), but P50 increased fecal score compared with S50 and CDCP. CDCP increased, but P50 reduced AID of CP in comparison to FM and S50. S50 and CDCP increased the amount of mixed neutral-acidic mucins relative to P50. Venn analysis identified unique OTUs in the P50 (13), CDCP (74), FM (39), and S50 (31) groups. The protein sources did not change the colonic bacterial richness or diversity. High  abundance in the P50 and FM, great abundant of  in the CDCP, and high  abundance in the S50 were found. The CDCP tended to elevate valeric  and branched chain fatty  (BCFA) concentrations compared with the other diets. The P50 and FM groups had greater ammonia nitrogen and methylamine contents than the S50 and CDCP groups. There was a positive correlation between the  and ammonia nitrogen, the  and short chain fatty  (SCFA), and a negative correlation between the  and BCFA. These findings suggested short-term feeding of different protein sources did not affect the piglets' growth, but P50 increased the diarrhea rate. Potential pathogenic bacteria and detrimental metabolites appeared in the colons of piglets fed P50 and FM, whereas, beneficial effects were conferred upon piglets fed CDCP and S50, thus indicating that available plant proteins (cotton seed, soy) added to the diets of piglets enhanced colon health by reducing protein fermentation.Copyright © 2019 Li, Chang, Hou, Song, Fan, He and Hou.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671166>Altered , fecal lactate, and fecal bile  in dogs with gastrointestinal disease.</a></h2><p>The intestinal  plays an important role in health and disease and produces, through fermentative reactions, several metabolic products, such as lactate, that can affect the host.

To investigate the prebiotic effect of patchouli essential oil (PEO) and its derived compounds through the modulation of gut  (GM). C57BL/6J mice were treated with the PEO and three active components of PEO,  patchouli alcohol (PA), pogostone (PO) and β-patchoulene (β-PAE) for 15 consecutive days. Fecal samples and mucosa were collected for GM biomarkers studies. PEO, PA, PO, and β-PAE improve the gut epithelial barrier by altering the status of E-cadherin vs. N-cadherin expressions, and increasing the mucosal p-lysozyme and Muc 2. Moreover, the treatments also facilitate the polarization of M1 to M2 macrophage phenotypes, meanwhile, suppress the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Fecal microbial DNAs were analyzed and evaluated for GM composition by ERIC-PCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The GM diversity was increased with the treated groups compared to the control. Further analysis showed that some known short chain fatty  (SCFAs)-producing bacteria, , , , , and  were significantly enriched in the treated groups. In addition, the key SCFAs receptors, GPR 41, 43 and 109a, were significantly stimulated in the gut epithelial layer of the treated mice. By contract, the relative abundance of pathogens  spp., , and  spp. were distinctly reduced by the treatments with PEO and β-PAE.

Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) is an end product in the human liver; however, mouse Cyp2c70 metabolizes CDCA to hydrophilic muricholic  (MCAs). Moreover, in humans the gut  converts the primary BAs cholic  and CDCA into deoxycholic  (DCA) and lithocholic  (LCA), respectively. In contrast, the mouse Cyp2a12 reverts this action and converts these secondary BAs to primary BAs. Here we generated Cyp2a12 KO, Cyp2c70 KO and Cyp2a12/Cyp2c70 double knockout (DKO) mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to study the regulations of BA metabolism under hydrophobic BA composition. Cyp2a12 KO mice showed the accumulation of DCAs, whereas Cyp2c70 KO mice lacked MCAs and exhibited markedly increased hepatobiliary proportions of CDCA. In DKO mice, not only DCAs or CDCAs but DCAs, CDCAs and LCAs were all elevated. In Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, chronic liver inflammation was observed depending on the hepatic unconjugated CDCA concentrations. The BA pool was markedly reduced in Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, but the farnesoid X receptor was not activated. It was suggested that the cytokine/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway and the pregnane X receptor-mediated pathway are the predominant mechanisms, preferred over the FXR/SHP and FXR/FGF15 pathways, for controlling BA synthesis under hydrophobic BA composition. From our results, we hypothesize that these KO mice can be novel and useful models for investigating the roles of hydrophobic BAs in various human diseases.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586220>In-Vitro Prebiotic Analysis of  Accessible Pectic Polysaccharides.</a></h2><p>Pectin is a diverse polysaccharide comprising of polygalacturonic , rhamnogalactouronan, and neutral polysaccharides (arabinan and arabinogalactan) as side chains or branches. They are resistant to salivary amylase and gastric juice. In the present study the prebiotic potentials of different pectic derived substrates were performed by using intestinal cultures and measuring the growth, change in pH and short chain fatty , (SCFA) production.

While, polygalacturonic  was fermented by Ba. fragilis, Ba. thetaiotaomicron, and Ba. uniformis. All the screened bacteria significantly decreased the pH from 7 to 5 (pH difference of ≈ 2), which clearly indicated that the above bacteria produced the enzymes necessary for the digestion of the pectic derived polysaccharides. The SCFA profiles of the above screened bacteria clearly demonstrated the production of lactate, acetate and propionate which are the key metabolites involved in maintaining gut health and prevention of several intestinal diseases.

In this study, an integrated high-throughput absolute abundance quantification (iHAAQ) method was applied to study the dynamics of microbial community and the characteristics of microorganism. The results showed a significant difference in bacterial community with diversity being higher in watershed area. The main influential factors for bacterial communities in watershed were physicochemical properties (e.g., pH and potassium), while in mining areas the main driving factors were metals/metalloids (e.g., As, Zn, and Pb). Notably, the major functions of microbial community were transporter and ABC transporter in mining area, while two-component system was more abundant in watershed by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotation analysis (level 3). In particular, Phyllobacterium, Bacteroides, and Sulfurovum were demonstrated to be potentially useful bacterial species for bioremediation, which should be a good choice for future studies. These results could facilitate our understanding of microbial diversity in different sediments of mining areas and identify microbial communities for bioremediation projects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The HAP strain isolated from roach intestine was Enterococcus faecium strain CGMCC1.2136. The experiment was a simple completely randomized design and lasted for eight weeks. Two hundred and seventy fish with an average weight of 12 g randomly distributed into nine tanks. The trial consisted of three treatments with three respective replications. During the experimental period, fish received basal diet without any bacterial supplementation (as the control group), basal diet enriched with 10 CFU g HAP or 10 CFU g CP. At the end of the experiment, serum immune parameters of those fish fed HAP including alkaline phosphatase activity, total protein content, total immunoglobulin level, lysozyme activity and complement activity (ACH50) were significantly higher that other experimental groups (P < 0.05). Similarly, dietary supplementation of HAP resulted in better mucosal immune parameters in comparison to control group and commercial probiotic administration (P < 0.05). Intestinal heterotrophic bacteria and autochthonous LAB counts of those fish fed HAP were significantly higher than other experimental groups at the end of the experiment as well as 15 days seizing probiotic administrations (P < 0.05). Fish fed with HAP containing diet presented significantly higher amylase, lipase and protease activity in comparison to the CP fed fish and the control group (P < 0.05). Growth indices of those fish fed HAP were significantly higher than other treatments (P < 0.05). The highest carcass protein and ash content along with the lowest body moisture content belonged to those fish received HAP (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the use host-HAP resulted in better immune competence and growth performance and it seems aquaculture sector should probably focus on the development of probiotics isolated from the cultured species instead of using terrestrial probiotics with greatly different requirements and environmental conditions.Copyright © 2019.

Changes in gut  composition have been linked to a number of neurodegenerative diseases, indicating a role for the gut-brain axis. Here, we show how specific gut-derived bacterial strains can modulate neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes  through the production of specific metabolites and discuss the potential therapeutic implications for neurodegenerative disorders. A panel of fifty gut bacterial strains was screened for their ability to reduce pro-inflammatory IL-6 secretion in U373 glioblastoma astrocytoma cells.  MRx0005 and  MRx0029 had the strongest capacity to reduce IL-6 secretion . Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and both bacterial strains displayed intrinsic antioxidant capacity. While MRx0005 showed a general antioxidant activity on different brain cell lines, MRx0029 only protected differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells from chemically induced oxidative stress. MRx0029 also induced a mature phenotype in undifferentiated neuroblastoma cells through upregulation of microtubule-associated protein 2. Interestingly, short-chain fatty  analysis revealed that MRx0005 mainly produced C1-C3 fatty , while MRx0029 produced C4-C6 fatty , specifically butyric, valeric and hexanoic . None of the short-chain fatty  tested protected neuroblastoma cells from chemically induced oxidative stress. However, butyrate was able to reduce neuroinflammation , and the combination of butyrate and valerate induced neuronal maturation, albeit not to the same degree as the complex cell-free supernatant of MRx0029. This observation was confirmed by solvent extraction of cell-free supernatants, where only MRx0029 methanolic fractions containing butyrate and valerate showed an anti-inflammatory activity in U373 cells and retained the ability to differentiate neuroblastoma cells. In summary, our results suggest that the pleiotropic nature of live biotherapeutics, as opposed to isolated metabolites, could be a promising novel drug class in drug discovery for neurodegenerative disorders.Copyright © 2019 Ahmed, Busetti, Fotiadou, Vincy Jose, Reid, Georgieva, Brown, Dunbar, Beurket-Ascencio, Delday, Ettorre and Mulder.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668625>Rhizosphere-Associated Pseudomonas Suppress Local Root Immune Responses by Gluconic -Mediated Lowering of Environmental pH.</a></h2><p>The root  consists of commensal, pathogenic, and plant-beneficial microbes [1]. Most members of the root  possess microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) similar to those of plant pathogens [2]. Their recognition can lead to the activation of host immunity and suppression of plant growth due to growth-defense tradeoffs [3, 4]. We found that 42% of the tested root , including the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 [5, 6] and Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 [6, 7], are able to quench local Arabidopsis thaliana root immune responses that are triggered by flg22 [8], an immunogenic epitope of the MAMP flagellin [9], suggesting that this is an important function of the root . In a screen for WCS358 mutants that lost their capacity to suppress flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS MAMP-reporter gene expression, we identified the bacterial genes pqqF and cyoB in WCS358, which are required for the production of gluconic  and its derivative 2-keto gluconic . Both WCS358 mutants are impaired in the production of these organic  and consequently lowered their extracellular pH to a lesser extent than wild-type WCS358. Acidification of the plant growth medium similarly suppressed flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS and MYB51:GUS expression, and the flg22-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting a role for rhizobacterial gluconic -mediated modulation of the extracellular pH in the suppression of root immunity. Rhizosphere population densities of the mutants were significantly reduced compared to wild-type. Collectively, these findings show that suppression of immune responses is an important function of the root , as it facilitates colonization by beneficial root .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Low-dose antibiotics (LDA) have been widely used to enhance growth rate of pigs, providing a good animal model to study the underlying mechanism. In present study, 28 female piglets, weaned at 21 d, were randomly classified into two groups, receiving either a control diet or a diet supplemented with LDA for 4 weeks. The total bacterial load and intestinal  were determined by qPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. UPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS and RNA-seq were further used to determine the colonic SCFAs and transcriptomes. Results showed that LDA significantly increased growth rate and food intake. The F/B index, Methanosphaera species, and the pathway of "carbohydrate metabolism" were improved by LDA exposure, indicating the better carbohydrate degradation and energy utilization. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated the microbial community contributing to SCFAs production was enriched upon LDA exposure, associating with increased concentrations of short-chain and branched-chain fatty  (caproate, 2-methyl butyrate and 4-methyl valerate). A multivariate linear fitting model analysis highlighted that caproate was positively correlated with two genera (Faecalibacterium and Allisonella) and four differentially expressed genes (ZNF134, TBX5, NEU4 and SEMA6D), which were all significantly increased upon LDA exposure. Collectively, our study indicates that the growth-promoting effect of LDA exposure in early life is associated with the shifts of colonic  to increase utilization of carbohydrates and energy, enhanced SCFAs production and colonic functions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

It is estimated that approximately 75% of treatment-resistant hypertension cases have an underlying OSA. Exploration of the gut  is a new advance in medicine that has been linked to many comorbid illnesses, including SH and OSA. Here, we will review the literature in SH and gut dysbiosis, OSA and gut dysbiosis, and whether gut dysbiosis is common in both conditions.We reviewed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, including PubMed and PubMed Central. We identified a total of 230 articles. The literature search was conducted using the phrase "obstructive sleep apnea and gut dysbiosis." Only original research articles were included. This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis, however, can cause a state of low-grade inflammation through damage to the gut wall barrier resulting in "leaky gut." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH.Gut dysbiosis seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension. Reversing gut dysbiosis at an early stage through prebiotics and probiotics and fecal  transplantation combined with positive airway pressure therapy may open new horizons of treatment to prevent SH.

We performed a systematic review using the PubMed/Medline database including primary articles written in English that measured leptin production or levels as well as SCFA used as an intervention, mechanism or outcome. The search yielded a total of 573 citations; 36 studies were included in the final analysis. The quality of the studies was analyzed through two validated tools based on objective criteria. Overall, the studies presented low risk of bias to construct and statistical validity. However, the majority presented a high risk of attrition and detection bias. In vitro studies (n = 8) consistently demonstrated that SCFA stimulate leptin expression in adipocytes through activation of free fatty  receptor 3 (FFAR3). In animal studies (n = 24), interventions to modulate high-fat diet outcomes predominantly caused a decrease in circulating leptin levels and increased SCFA, associated with suppressed weight gain. Control of dysbiosis through administration of prebiotics and probiotics also played a role in leptin synthesis in animal studies. In human studies (n = 4) leptin was mainly correlated with adiposity but dysbiosis interfered with this relationship. We conclude that the association between SCFA and leptin remains incompletely understood but occurs mainly through the activation of FFAR3 in adipocytes. However, body fat rather than SCFA remains the main driver for leptin synthesis in vivo. Future studies should aim to better clarify the role of SCFA in regulating leptin production in vivo.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, it is crucial to investigate farm management practices such as the bedding materials. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of recycled manure solids (RMS) as bedding material on bulk tank milk and microbiological implications for cheese quality. Bulk tank samples were collected from 84 dairy farms using RMS or straw bedding. The use of RMS did not influence thermophilic and mesophilic aerobic viable counts from spores. However, straw-milk samples gave higher values for mesophilic anaerobic spore-forming bacteria (0.44 log cfu/mL) than RMS-milk samples (0.17 log cfu/mL). The presence of thermoresistant lactic  bacteria was not increased in milk from farms using RMS. Nevertheless, taxonomic profiles of thermoresistant bacteria isolated were different between the 2 types of milk. More Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus spp. were identified in RMS-milk samples. Thermoresistant enterococci and streptococci could easily end up in cheese. Therefore, milk proteolytic activities of these isolates were tested. Neither Streptococcus spp. nor Enterococcus faecium isolates exhibited proteolytic activities, whereas 53% of E. faecalis showed some. Also, only 1 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus was detected. Survival of selected RMS-milk samples isolates (3 E. faecalis and 1 Streptococcus thermophilus) was evaluated during a model Cheddar cheese manufacture. Although those strains survived well, they did not modify the acidification curve of milk.

Fecal  transplantation (FMT) experiment also replicated the therapeutic effects, which indicates the potential targets of XAN on gut . The sequencing of 16S rRNA genes in fecal samples demonstrated that XAN reversed gut  dysbiosis in AD animals. XAN could change the relative abundances of several phyla and genus of bacterial, particularly the ratio of . Among them, , , , and  had been reported to be involved in the pathologic developments of AD and other central nervous system disease.

Combined with the Spearman's correlation analysis, it was confirmed that the increases of five bacterial strains and decreases of six bacterial strains were closely correlated with the increases of nine host metabolites and the decreases of another five host metabolites. Therefore, XAN can modulate the structure of gut  in AD rats; the changes of gut  were significantly correlated with endogenous metabolites, and symptom of AD was ultimately alleviated.

It is not necessarily more difficult to measure antimicrobial activity the traditional way, but it is, however, more laborious. In the present study, we developed a new method to measure the antimicrobial activity of LA in multiple samples with a microplate reader. A "test complex" (TC) was produced consisting of 100 μL of agar medium with LA in the bottom layer and 300 μL of broth in the top layer in 96-well deep-well microplates. Afterward, analysis of the broth in the top layer showed that the antimicrobial activity was the same as that of the "control complex," (CC) which consisted of 100 μL of agar medium in the bottom layer and 300 μL of broth with LA in the top layer. Furthermore, evaluation of the antimicrobial effect of the TC when using a microplate reader was the same as that with the use of the colony counting method. The colony counting method has confirmed that the antimicrobial activity of LA when bacteria are inoculated into the broth was equivalent between CC and TC, and we validated this by correlating the number of bacteria with absorbance. In addition, the broth itself in TC was transparent enough that the turbidity of broth can be used as an index of the number of bacteria, which enabled the use of a microplate reader for multiple samples. For human gut microbes, LA was shown to have low antimicrobial activity against commensal lactic  bacteria, but high antimicrobial activity against pathogenic  and , suggesting that LA might modulate intestinal health, as confirmed by the proposed method.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623169>Urolithin Metabotypes Can Determine the Modulation of Gut  in Healthy Individuals by Tracking Walnuts Consumption over Three Days.</a></h2><p>Walnuts are rich in polyphenols ellagitannins, modulate gut  (GM), and exert health benefits after long-term consumption. The metabolism of ellagitannins to urolithins via GM depends on urolithin metabotypes (UM-A, -B, or -0), which have been reported to predict host responsiveness to a polyphenol-rich intervention.

We aimed to investigate the effect of kefir on trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced colitis in rats using two different doses. Fifty-four Wistar rats were divided into six groups. For 14 days, the normal control and colitis control groups were given tap water, kefir10 control, kefir10 colitis, and kefir30 control, and the kefir30 colitis groups were given phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% or 30% kefir, respectively, instead of tap water. Colitis was induced by intracolonically administrating TNBS in the colitis control, kefir10 colitis, and kefir30 colitis groups. On the 14th day, the rats were sacrificed. The weights and lengths of the colons were measured and macroscopically evaluated, and the distal 10 cm segments were subjected to a histopathological examination. The incidence of bloody stool and diarrhea in the kefir10 colitis group was found to be less than the colitis control and kefir30 colitis groups. The colonic weight/length ratio in the kefir10 colitis group was lower than that in the colitis control and kefir30 colitis groups. We detected that the 10% kefir treatment reduced TNBS-induced macroscopic colonic damage, while it was exacerbated by the 30% kefir treatment. No significant difference was observed between the colitis groups in terms of microscopic colonic damage scoring. These results indicate that kefir, with a careful dose selection, may be a useful agent in the treatment of IBD.© 2019 The Authors.

Understanding the biological characteristics of O. hupensis is a prerequisite for its control; however, there are currently no studies investigating the intestinal  of the O. hupensis snail. This study aimed to profile the intestinal  of O. hupensis across different ecological landscapes in mainland China. DNA was extracted from the intestines of the collected snails and the bacterial communities were detected using 454 pyrosequencing. A total of 3,799 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained, and Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were identified as the dominant bacterial taxa at the phylum level. Bacillus and Lactococcus were the most common genera in samples obtained from the four ecological landscapes. Snail specimens were clustered into three clades according to microbial community diversity, and thirty-seven genera that contributed to differential  distributions were identified. Co-occurrence network analysis indicated a symbiotic relationship for the intestinal  of O. hupensis, and PICRUSt analysis predicted forty-one metabolic functions in all snail samples, including membrane transport, amino  metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, replication and repair, energy metabolism, as well as xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism. These findings improve our understanding of bacterial ecology in the O. hupensis intestine; further studies will focus on the relationship between O. hupensis intestinal  and the  in their specific ecological environments.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigated the effects of CYP on the intestinal  and gut defence barrier of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.). Different groups of experimental fish were fed a normal control diet (NC), a low CYP diet (LYP) and a high CYP diet (HYP) for 8 weeks. After the feeding trial, the fish were assessed for intestinal enzyme activity, intestinal histology, immune-related gene expression, intestinal SCFAs and intestinal . Our results indicated that the intestinal integrity and antioxidant enzyme (CAT and SOD) activity in the common carp were enhanced following CYP supplementation. The mRNA levels of anti-inflammatory (TGF-β), tight binding protein (occludin and ZO-1) and pathway factor genes (TLR4 and NF-κB) were significantly upregulated in the HYP group (P＜0.05), which was accompanied by an increase in the level of pro-inflammatory IL-1β in the gut (P＜0.05). High-throughput sequencing revealed that Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes bacteria were most abundant in the microbial community in the gut of the common carp. The relative abundances of Bacteroides, Flavobacterium and Lactobacillus were increased, while the abundances of pathogenic microorganisms such as Enterobacteriaceae, Shewanella, Pseudomonas and Vibrio were reduced after treatment with CYP. Furthermore, the concentrations of acetic , propionic , butyric  and total short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) in the gut were also increased (P＜0.05). Finally, our results revealed correlations between gut , SCFAs, non-specific immunity and antioxidant enzymes in CYP-fed carp. These results suggest that CYP-supplemented feed could improve the immunity of the common carp by modulating the intestinal microflora and enhancing the gut defence barrier and has the potential to be used as an immunostimulating feed additive in aquaculture.Copyright © 2019.

In the present study, the effects of DADS on lipid metabolism and its potential role in the modulation of the gut  were determined. Hematoxylin and eosin and oil‑red O staining were used to assess the liver and intestinal tissues of mice treated with DADS. The expression of lipid metabolism‑associated genes was measured using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR (RT‑qPCR). The effects of DADS on the gut  were measured using 16S recombinant (r)DNA gene analysis. The results revealed that the serum non‑esterified free fatty , high density lipoprotein‑cholesterol, low density lipoprotein‑cholesterol, serum total cholesterol, liver triglyceride and total cholesterol levels of the mice fed with a low‑dose of DADS was significantly higher when compared with the control. Hematoxylin and eosin and oil‑red O staining demonstrated that DADS induced fatty liver in mice. The results of the RT‑qPCR revealed that the expression levels of a number of lipid metabolism‑associated genes were altered in the livers of mice treated with DADS. The 16S rDNA gene analysis demonstrated that the mice fed on a normal diet treated with a low‑dose of DADS had decreased levels of bacteria from the Bacteroidetes phyla and increased levels of bacteria from the Firmicutes phyla. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis revealed the top 20 pathways enriched in the low‑dose DADS group of mice fed with a normal diet.

Our previous studies have shown that exposure to GW chemicals resulted in altered  which was associated with damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) release followed by neuro and gastrointestinal inflammation with loss of gut barrier integrity. Enteric glial cells (EGC) are emerging as important regulators of the gastrointestinal tract and have been observed to change to a reactive phenotype in several functional gastrointestinal disorders such as IBS and IBD. This study is aimed at investigating the role of dysbiosis associated EGC immune-activation and redox instability in contributing to observed gastrointestinal barrier integrity loss in GWI via altered tight junction protein expression. Using a mouse model of GWI and  studies with cultured EGC and use of antibiotics to ensure gut decontamination we show that exposure to GW chemicals caused dysbiosis associated change in EGCs. EGCs changed to a reactive phenotype characterized by activation of TLR4-S100β/RAGE-iNOS pathway causing release of nitric oxide and activation of NOX2 since gut sterility with antibiotics prevented this change. The resulting peroxynitrite generation led to increased oxidative stress that triggered inflammation as shown by increased NLRP-3 inflammasome activation and increased cell death. Activated EGCs  and  were associated with decrease in tight junction protein occludin and selective water channel aquaporin-3 with a concomitant increase in Claudin-2. The tight junction protein levels were restored following a parallel treatment of GWI mice with a TLR4 inhibitor SsnB and butyric  that are known to decrease the immunoactivation of EGCs. Our study demonstrates that immune-redox mechanisms in EGC are important players in the pathology in GWI and may be possible therapeutic targets for improving outcomes in GWI symptom persistence.Copyright © 2019 Kimono, Sarkar, Albadrani, Seth, Bose, Mondal, Li, Kar, Nagarkatti, Nagarkatti, Sullivan, Janulewicz, Lasley, Horner, Klimas and Chatterjee.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576099>Evaluation and comparison of short chain fatty  composition in gut diseases.</a></h2><p>An altered (dysbiosis) and unhealthy status of the gut  is usually responsible for a reduction of short chain fatty  (SCFAs) concentration. SCFAs obtained from the carbohydrate fermentation processes are crucial in maintaining gut homeostasis and their determination in stool samples could provide a faster, reliable and cheaper method to highlight the presence of an intestinal dysbiosis and a biomarker for various gut diseases. We hypothesize that different intestinal diseases, such as celiac disease (CD), adenomatous polyposis (AP) and colorectal cancer (CRC) could display a particular fecal SCFAs' signature.To compare the fecal SCFAs' profiles of CD, AP, CRC patients and healthy controls, using the same analytical method.In this cross-sectional study, we defined and compared the SCFAs' concentration in fecal samples of 9 AP, 16 CD, 19 CRC patients and 16 healthy controls (HC). The SCFAs' analysis were performed using a gas-chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry method. Data analysis was carried out using Wilcoxon rank-sum test to assess pairwise differences of SCFAs' profiles, partial least squares-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) to determine the status membership based on distinct SCFAs' profiles, and Dirichlet regression to determine factors influencing concentration levels of SCFAs.We have not observed any difference in the SCFAs' amount and composition between CD and healthy control. On the contrary, the total amount of SCFAs was significantly lower in CRC patients compared to HC ( = 0.044) and CD ( = 0.005). Moreover, the SCFAs' percentage composition was different in CRC and AP compared to HC. In detail, HC displayed higher percentage of acetic  ( value = 1.3 × 10) and a lower amount of butyric ( value = 0.02192), isobutyric ( value = 7.4 × 10), isovaleric ( value = 0.00012) and valeric ( value = 0.00014)  compared to CRC patients. AP showed a lower abundance of acetic  ( value = 0.00062) and higher percentages of propionic ( value = 0.00433) and isovaleric ( value = 0.00433)  compared to HC. Moreover, AP showed higher levels of propionic  ( value = 0.03251) and a lower level of isobutyric  ( value = 0.00427) in comparison to CRC. The PLS-DA model demonstrated a significant separation of CRC and AP groups from HC, although some degree of overlap was observed between CRC and AP.Analysis of fecal SCFAs shows the potential to provide a non-invasive means of diagnosis to detect patients with CRC and AP, while CD patients cannot be discriminated from healthy subjects.©The Author(s) 2019.

Modification of gut  and repression of BA synthesis are potential strategies for the treatment of cholestatic liver disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects and to understand the mechanisms of the probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), on hepatic bile  synthesis, liver injury and fibrosis in bile-duct ligation (BDL) and Mdr2 mice. Global and intestinal specific FXR inhibitors were used to dissect the role of FXR. LGG treatment significantly attenuated liver inflammation, injury and fibrosis with a significant reduction of hepatic BAs in BDL mice. Hepatic concentration of T-βMCA, an FXR antagonist, was markedly increased in BDL mice and reduced in LGG-treated mice, while chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), an FXR agonist, was decreased in BDL mice and normalized in LGG-treated mice. LGG treatment significantly increased the expression of serum and ileum FGF15 and subsequently reduced hepatic CYP7A1 and BA synthesis in BDL and Mdr2 mice. At the molecular level, these changes were reversed by global and intestinal specific FXR inhibitors in BDL mice. In addition, LGG treatment altered gut , which was associated with increased BA de-conjugation and increased fecal and urine BA excretion both in BDL and Mdr2 mice. In vitro studies showed that LGG suppressed the inhibitory effect of T-βMCA on FXR and FGF19 expression in Caco-2 cells. Conclusion: LGG supplementation decreases hepatic BA by increasing intestinal FXR/FGF15 signaling pathway-mediated suppression of BA de novo synthesis and enhances BA excretion, which prevents excessive BA-induced liver injury and fibrosis in mice.© 2019 The Authors.

Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) reduces cholesterol via its conversion into bile  (BAs). During RCT in non-hepatic peripheral tissues, cholesterol is transferred to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and returned to the liver for conversion into BAs predominantly via the rate-limiting enzyme, cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). Numerous reports have described that polyphenol induced increases in BA excretion and corresponding reductions in total and LDL cholesterol in animal and in-vitro studies, but the process whereby this occurs has not been extensively reviewed. There are three main mechanisms by which BA excretion can be augmented: (1) increased expression of CYP7A1; (2) reduced expression of intestinal BA transporters; and (3) changes in the gut . Here we summarise the BA metabolic pathways focusing on CYP7A1, how its gene is regulated via transcription factors, diurnal rhythms, and microRNAs. Importantly, we will address the following questions: (1) Can polyphenols enhance BA secretion by modulating the CYP7A1 biosynthetic pathway? (2) Can polyphenols alter the BA pool via changes in the gut ? (3) Which polyphenols are the most promising candidates for future research? We conclude that while in rodents some polyphenols induce CYP7A1 expression predominantly by the LXRα pathway, in human cells, this may occur through FXR, NF-KB, and ERK signalling. Additionally, gut  is important for the de-conjugation and excretion of BAs. Puerarin, resveratrol, and quercetin are promising candidates for further research in this area.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604771>AidB, a novel thermostable -acylhomoserine lactonase from the bacterium  sp.</a></h2><p>Many Gram-negative bacteria employ -acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) as quorum sensing (QS) signal molecules to regulate virulence expression in a density-dependent manner. Quorum quenching (QQ) via enzymatic inactivation of AHLs is a promising strategy to reduce bacterial infections and drug resistance.

AidB was thermostable in the range 30 to 80 °C and showed maximum activity after pre-incubating at 60 °C for 30 min. The optimum temperature of AidB was 60 °C, and the enzyme could be stably stored in ddHO at 4 °C or room temperature.

GAAS is clinically applied to treat immune-mediated liver injury, but its mechanism remains elusive. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the mechanism in which GAAS alleviates immune-mediated liver injury induced by Concanavalin A (ConA). After ten days of intragastric administration of GAAS, 20 mg/kg ConA was injected via tail vein to establish the immune-mediated liver injury model of BALB/C mice. Then, the concentrations of ALT, AST, and TBIL in the serum of mice were determined. H&E staining was performed to observe the pathological changes in the liver, and the expression of liver cytokines was detected by qPCR. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis was employed to detect the expression of liver-related proteins. The apoptosis in liver tissue was detected by TUNEL. Our results suggest that GAAS demonstrated excellent protective effects in the liver. We found that GAAS down-regulated the mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-17A, and it up-regulated the mRNA expression of IL-4 and TGF-β. Additionally, GAAS may modulate the balance of four immune cells (Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg) by regulating the expression of T-bet, GATA3, RORγt, and Foxp3 to alleviate liver injury in mice. Furthermore, GAAS decreased hepatocyte apoptosis by blocking the JAK1/STAT1/IRF1 pathway, suppressing oxidative stress, decreasing p-JNK expression, and regulating the expression of apoptosis-related proteins. In summary, the mechanism of GAAS in liver injury alleviation acts to regulate the balance of Th cells in the liver to inhibit hepatocyte apoptosis. This study may provide a new strategy for the treatment of immune-mediated liver injury.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

Five bacterial species with the capacity to degrade polymers and/or produce acidic fermentation products detectable in human feces were used in the experiments.

These SCFAs are potent preventive agents against colorectal cancer due to their histone deacetylases inhibitory properties, which induce apoptosis in tumor colonocytes. As colorectal cancer is the fourth most common neoplasia in Europe with 28.2 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants, a cost-effective preventive strategy has been tested in this work by redesigning common porcine meat products (chorizo sausages and cooked ham) consumed by a substantial proportion of the population towards potential colorectal cancer preventive functional foods. In order to test the preventive effect of these inulin-rich meat products against colorectal cancer, an animal model (Rattus norvegicus F344) was used, involving two doses of azoxymethane (10 mg/kg) and two treatments with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) during a 20-week assay period. Control feed, control sausages, functional sausages (15.7% inulin), control cooked ham and functional cooked ham (10% inulin) were used to feed the corresponding animal cohorts. Then, the animals were sacrificed and their digestive tract tissues were analyzed. The results showed a statistically significant 49% reduction in the number of colon polyps in the functional meat products cohorts with respect to the control meat products animals, as well as an increase in the cecum weight (an indicator of a diet rich in prebiotic fiber), a 51.8% increase in colon propionate production, a 39.1% increase in colon butyrate concentrations, and a reduction in the number of hyperplastic Peyer's patches. Metagenomics studies also demonstrated colon  differences, revealing a significant increase in Bacteroidetes populations in the functional meat products (mainly due to an increase in Bacteroidaceae and Prevotellaceae families, which include prominent propionate producers), together with a reduction in Firmicutes (especially due to lower Lachnospiraceae populations). However, functional meat products showed a remarkable increase in the anti-inflammatory and fiber-fermentative Blautia genus, which belongs to this Lachnospiraceae family. The functional meat products cohorts also presented a reduction in important pro-inflammatory bacterial populations, such as those of the genus Desulfovibrio and Bilophila. These results were corroborated in a genetic animal model of CRC (F344/NSlc-Apc) that produced similar results. Therefore, processed meat products can be redesigned towards functional prebiotic foods of interest as a cost-effective dietary strategy for preventing colorectal cancer in human populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674054>Long-term impact of tylosin on fecal  and fecal bile  of healthy dogs.</a></h2><p>Tylosin is commonly prescribed to dogs with diarrhea.

Nutritional constituents strongly influence composition and functional properties of the intestinal microbial communities. Here, we report that omission of a single essential amino  - tryptophan - from the diet abrogates CNS autoimmunity in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Dietary tryptophan restriction results in impaired encephalitogenic T cell responses and is accompanied by a mild intestinal inflammatory response and a profound phenotypic shift of gut . Protective effects of dietary tryptophan restriction are abrogated in germ-free mice, but are independent of canonical host sensors of intracellular tryptophan metabolites. We conclude that dietary tryptophan restriction alters metabolic properties of gut , which in turn have an impact on encephalitogenic T cell responses. This link between gut , dietary tryptophan and adaptive immunity may help to develop therapeutic strategies for protection from autoimmune neuroinflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595010>Metabolic output defines Escherichia coli as a health-promoting microbe against intestinal Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</a></h2><p>Gut  acts as a barrier against intestinal pathogens, but species-specific protection of the host from infection remains relatively unexplored. Although lactobacilli and bifidobacteria produce beneficial lactic and short-chain fatty  in the mammalian gut, the significance of intestinal Escherichia coli producing these  is debatable. Taking a Koch's postulates approach in reverse, we define Escherichia coli as health-promoting for naturally colonizing the gut of healthy mice and protecting them against intestinal colonization and concomitant mortality by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Reintroduction of faecal bacteria and E. coli in antibiotic-treated mice establishes a high titre of E. coli in the host intestine and increases defence against P. aeruginosa colonization and mortality. Strikingly, high sugar concentration favours E. coli fermentation to lactic and acetic  and inhibits P. aeruginosa growth and virulence in aerobic cultures and in a model of aerobic metabolism in flies, while dietary vegetable fats - not carbohydrates or proteins - favour E. coli fermentation and protect the host in the anaerobic mouse gut. Thus E. coli metabolic output is an important indicator of resistance to infection. Our work may also suggest that the lack of antimicrobial bacterial metabolites in mammalian lungs and wounds allows P. aeruginosa to be a formidable microbe at these sites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571427>Faecal  and functional capacity associated with weaning weight in meat rabbits.</a></h2><p>Weaning weight is an important economic trait in the meat rabbit industry. Evidence has linked the gut  to health and production performance in rabbits. However, the effect of gut  on meat rabbit weaning weight remains unclear. In this study, we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis of 135 faecal samples from commercial Ira rabbits. We detected 50 OTUs significantly associated with weaning weight. OTUs that showed positive associations with weaning weight were mostly members of the family Ruminococcaceae which are important in degrading dietary fibres and producing butyrate. On the contrary, OTUs annotated to genera Blautia, Lachnoclostridium and Butyricicoccus correlated with fat deposition were negatively associated with weaning weight. Predicted functional capacity analysis revealed that 91 KOs and 26 KEGG pathways exhibited potential correlations with weaning weight. We found that gut  involved in the metabolism of amino , butanoate, energy and monosaccharides affected weaning weight. Additionally, cross-validation analysis indicated that 16.16% of the variation in weaning weight was explained by the gut .

Determining the optimal levels of nutrient supplies to cultures can eliminate feeding of excess nutrients, lowering production costs and reducing nutrient pollution into the environment. With the advent of omics and bioinformatics methods, it is now possible to construct genome-scale models that accurately describe the metabolism of microorganisms. In this study, a genome-scale model of the green alga  (CZ946) was applied to predict feeding of multiple nutrients, including nitrate and glucose, under both autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions. The objective function was changed from optimizing growth to instead minimizing nitrate and glucose uptake rates, enabling predictions of feed rates for these nutrients. The metabolic model control (MMC) algorithm was validated for autotrophic growth, saving 18% nitrate while sustaining algal growth. Additionally, we obtained similar growth profiles by simultaneously controlling glucose and nitrate supplies under heterotrophic conditions for both high and low levels of glucose and nitrate. Finally, the nitrate supply was controlled in order to retain protein and chlorophyll synthesis, albeit at a lower rate, under nitrogen-limiting conditions. This model-driven cultivation strategy doubled the total volumetric yield of biomass, increased fatty  methyl ester (FAME) yield by 61%, and enhanced lutein yield nearly 3 fold compared to nitrogen starvation. This study introduces a control methodology that integrates omics data and genome-scale models in order to optimize nutrient supplies based on the metabolic state of algal cells in different nutrient environments. This approach could transform bioprocessing control into a systems biology-based paradigm suitable for a wide range of species in order to limit nutrient inputs, reduce processing costs, and optimize biomanufacturing for the next generation of desirable biotechnology products.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675161>Interaction of Gut  and High-sodium, Low-potassium Diet in Altering Plasma Triglyceride Profiles Revealed by Lipidomics Analysis.</a></h2><p>High-sodium and low-potassium (HNaLK) intake increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic syndrome. We investigated if the dietary minerals interact with the gut  to alter circulating lipid profiles, implicated in CVD and metabolic syndrome.Plasma samples from Wistar rats fed a control or HNaLK diet with or without antibiotic treatment (n = 7 each, a total of 28) were subjected to lipidomics analysis. Lipidomic data were then analyzed using various statistical and bioinformatics tools, which detected numerous lipid species altered by the treatments, and consistently demonstrated interactions between the gut  and the HNaLK diet in altering circulating lipids, mainly triglycerides (TGs). We identified two distinct TG groups, differentially regulated by antibiotic treatment. One group (cluster 1), representing the majority of TG species detected, was downregulated, whereas the other group (cluster 2) was upregulated by antibiotic treatment. Interestingly, cluster 2 TGs were also regulated by the diet. Cluster 2 TGs exhibited greater carbon-chain length and double-bond content and included TGs composed of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty , previously associated with reduced diabetes risk.The HNaLK diet interacts with gut bacteria to alter plasma lipid profiles, which may be related to its health effects.

The concept of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), a condition of abnormal proliferation of the small intestine , has been proposed as a form of small intestine dysbiosis. In Parkinson's disease patients, weight loss and metabolic disorders such as lipid abnormalities are frequently encountered. This was a prospective investigation of the presence of SIBO using the lactulose breath test, Parkinson's disease symptoms, medications, abdominal symptoms, and blood data involving 39 Parkinson's disease patients. Of the 39 patients, 19 were positive for SIBO, 16 were negative, and 4 were equivocal. SIBO-positive patients had a significantly smaller dopaminergic drug load (dopamine replacement of Parkinson's disease drug potency) (P = 0.009) and significantly lower serum triglyceride (TG) (P = 0.024) and total bilirubin (P = 0.019) levels. No relationship was seen between the presence or absence of SIBO and motor or abdominal symptoms. The following hypothesis was developed with regard to the possibility that intestinal bacterial overgrowth has various effects that are exhibited via bile  metabolism in Parkinson's disease patients. Serum bilirubin levels become higher as bilirubin metabolism declines with decreases in the intestinal bacteria. At the same time, bile  is broken down due to increased intestinal bacteria, and lipid absorption decreases. This induces low serum TG levels and leads to weight loss. By a similar mechanism, there is less absorption of vitamin D as bile  levels decrease, leading to osteoporosis and fractures. The possibility that some of the non-motor manifestations accompanying Parkinson's disease are caused by intestinal dysbiosis needs to be considered.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We compared the intestinal fermentative capability of stunted and nonstunted ('healthy') children in southern India using two types of RS: high amylose maize starch (HAMS) and acetylated HAMS (HAMSA). Twenty children (10 stunted and 10 healthy) aged 2 to 5 years were fed biscuits containing HAMS (10 g/day) for two weeks followed by a 2-week washout and then HAMSA biscuits (10 g/day) for 2 weeks. Fecal samples were collected at 3-4 day intervals and pH and SCFA analyzed. At entry, stunted children had lower SCFA concentrations compared to healthy children. Both types of RS led to a significant decrease in fecal pH and increase in fecal acetate and propionate in both healthy and stunted children. However, while HAMS increased fecal butyrate in both groups of children, HAMSA increased butyrate in healthy but not stunted children. Furthermore, healthy children showed a significantly greater increase than stunted children in both acetate and butyrate when fed either RS. No adverse effects were reported with either RS.

Substantial changes in host hormones, metabolism, and immunity around the parturition period may be accompanied by alterations in the gut . However, to our knowledge, changes in the gut  and their contribution to the shifts in host metabolism around parturition have not been investigated in pigs. Furthermore, pigs are an ideal biomedical model for studying the interactions of the gut  with host metabolism, due to the ease of controlling feeding conditions. Here we report dramatic remodeling of the gut  and the potential functional capacity during the late stages of pregnancy (5 days before parturition, LP) to postpartum (within 6 h after delivery, PO) in both experimental and validated populations of sows ( = 107). The richness of bacteria in the gut of both pregnant and delivery sows significantly decreased, whilst the β-diversity dramatically expanded. The ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes, and the relative abundance of Prevotella significantly decreased, whilst the relative abundance of the predominant genus  significantly increased from LP to PO state. The predicted functional capacities of the gut  related to amino  metabolism, the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, and glycan biosynthesis were significantly decreased from LP to PO state. However, the abundance of the functional capacities associated with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism were increased. Consistent with these changes, serum metabolites enriched at the LP stage were associated with the metabolism of amino  and vitamins. In contrast, metabolites enriched at the PO stage were related to lipid metabolism. We further identified that the richness and β-diversity of the gut  and the abundance of  accounted for shifts in the levels of bile  metabolites associated with lipid metabolism. The results suggest that host- interactions during the perinatal period impact host metabolism. These benefit the lactation of sows by providing energy from lipid metabolism for milk production.Copyright © 2019 Huang, Gao, Zhao, He, Ke, Wu, Zhou, Fu, Yang, Chen and Huang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681796>Light-Stress Influences the Composition of the Murine Gut , Memory Function, and Plasma Metabolome.</a></h2><p>The gut  plays an important role in the mammalian host and when in proper balance helps protect health and prevent disease.

When compared to intensive medical therapy and lifestyle intervention, metabolic surgery has shown superiority in achieving glycemic improvement, reducing number of medications and cardiovascular risk factors, which translates in long-term benefits on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms underlying diabetes improvement after metabolic surgery have not yet been clearly understood but englobe a complex interaction among improvements in beta cell function and insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, intestinal gluconeogenesis, changes in glucose utilization, and absorption by the gut and changes in the secretory pattern and morphology of adipose tissue.

In addition, daily supplement of 50 mg/kg sodium ferulate improved the ejection fraction and changed the gut  composition of TAC mice. Relative abundance of Lactobacillus and Parabacteroides are increased in TAC mice gavaged with sodium ferulate. In addition, Lactobacillus is negatively correlated with HW/BW and LW/BW ratio. These results suggest that the beneficial effect of ferulic in TAC mice is probably through the regulation of gut .Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

There are many predisposing factors, for example, genetic predisposition, smoking, or a diet rich in red, processed meat and poor in vegetables and fruits. Probiotics may be helpful in the prevention of cancer and may provide support during treatment. The main aim of this study is to characterize the potential mechanisms of action of probiotics, in particular the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer. Probiotics' potential mechanisms of action are, for example, modification of intestinal , improvement of colonic physicochemical conditions, production of anticancerogenic and antioxidant metabolites against carcinogenesis, a decrease in intestinal inflammation, and the production of harmful enzymes. The prevention of colorectal cancer is associated with favorable quantitative and qualitative changes in the intestinal , as well as changes in metabolic activity and in the physicochemical conditions of the intestine. In addition, it is worth noting that the effect depends on the bacterial strain, as well as on the dose administered.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591306>In vitro Fermentation of Polysaccharides from  and the Evaluation of Antioxidant Activity and Production of Short Chain Fatty .</a></h2><p>Soluble or fermentable fibre has prebiotic effects that can be used in the food industry to modify the composition of  species to benefit human health. Prebiotics mostly target Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains, among others, which can fight against chronic diseases since colonic fermentation produces short chain fatty  (SCFAs). The present work studied the changes produced in the fibre and polyphenolic compounds during in vitro digestion of gel (AV) and a polysaccharide extract (AP) from , after which, these fractions were subjected to in vitro colonic fermentation to evaluate the changes in antioxidant capacity and SCFAs production during the fermentation. The results showed that the phenolic compounds increased during digestion, but were reduced in fermentation, as a consequence, the antioxidant activity increased significantly in AV and AP after the digestion. On the other hand, during in vitro colon fermentation, the unfermented fibre of AV and AP responded as lactulose and the total volume of gas produced, which indicates the possible use of  and polysaccharide extract as prebiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632365>Use of Lactic  Bacteria to Reduce Methane Production in Ruminants, a Critical Review.</a></h2><p>Enteric fermentation in ruminants is the single largest anthropogenic source of agricultural methane and has a significant role in global warming. Consequently, innovative solutions to reduce methane emissions from livestock farming are required to ensure future sustainable food production. One possible approach is the use of lactic  bacteria (LAB), Gram positive bacteria that produce lactic  as a major end product of carbohydrate fermentation. LAB are natural inhabitants of the intestinal tract of mammals and are among the most important groups of microorganisms used in food fermentations. LAB can be readily isolated from ruminant animals and are currently used on-farm as direct-fed microbials (DFMs) and as silage inoculants. While it has been proposed that LAB can be used to reduce methane production in ruminant livestock, so far research has been limited, and convincing animal data to support the concept are lacking. This review has critically evaluated the current literature and provided a comprehensive analysis and summary of the potential use and mechanisms of LAB as a methane mitigation strategy. It is clear that although there are some promising results, more research is needed to identify whether the use of LAB can be an effective methane mitigation option for ruminant livestock.Copyright © 2019 Doyle, Mbandlwa, Kelly, Attwood, Li, Ross, Stanton and Leahy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615057>Differential Effects of Typical Korean Versus American-Style Diets on Gut Microbial Composition and Metabolic Profile in Healthy Overweight Koreans: A Randomized Crossover Trial.</a></h2><p>The Westernized diet has been associated with the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, whereas a Korean diet has been reported to exert beneficial effects on health in several studies. However, the effects of Western and Korean diets on the gut  and host metabolome are unclear. To examine the diet-specific effects on  and metabolome, we conducted a randomized crossover clinical trial of typical Korean diet (TKD), typical American diet (TAD), and recommended American diet (RAD). The trial involved a 4-week consumption of an experimental diet followed by a 2-week interval before diet crossover. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis identified 16, 10, and 14 differential bacteria genera specific to TKD, RAD, and TAD, respectively. The Firmucutes-Bacteroidetes ratio was increased by TKD. Nuclear magnetic resonance metabolome profiling revealed that TKD enriched branched chain amino  metabolism, whereas ketone body metabolism was evident in RAD and TAD.  and metabolome responses to the experimental diets varied with individual enterotypes. These findings provide evidence that the gut  and host metabolome rapidly respond to different cultural diets. The findings will inform clarification of the diet-related communication networks of the gut  and host metabolome in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634462>Time-dependent alteration to the tight junction structure of distal intestinal epithelia in type 2 prediabetic mice.</a></h2><p>High-fat diet (HFD) intake has been associated with changes in intestinal  composition, increased intestinal permeability, and onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this work was twofold: 1) to investigate the structural and functional alterations of the tight junction (TJ)-mediated intestinal epithelial barrier of ileum and colon, that concentrate most of the , after exposure to a HFD for 15, 30 and 60 days, and 2) to assess the effect of in vitro exposure to free fatty  (FFAs), one of the components of HFD, on paracellular barrier of colon-derived Caco-2 cells.HFD exposure induced progressive metabolic changes in male mice that culminated in prediabetes after 60d. Morphological analysis of ileum and colon mucosa showed no signs of epithelial rupture or local inflammation but changes in the junctional content/distribution and/or cellular content of TJ-associated proteins (claudins-1, -2, -3, and occludin) in intestinal epithelia were seen mainly after a prediabetes state has been established. This impairment in TJ structure was not associated with significant changes in intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran. Exposure of Caco-2 monolayers to palmitic or linoleic  seems to induce a reinforcement of TJ structure while treatment with oleic  had a more diverse effect on TJ protein distribution.TJ structure in distal intestinal epithelia can be specifically impaired by HFD intake at early stage of T2DM, but not by FFAs in vitro. Since the TJ change in ileum/colon was marginal, probably it does not contribute to the disease onset.Copyright © 2019.

Five samples of commercial spelt flour were subjected to spontaneous fermentation to obtain a type I sourdough. A total of 186 LAB and 174 yeast isolates were selected at different refreshment steps and subjected to further analyses. Within LAB, coccal isolates constituted 78.5% of the total LAB, with the dominance of Pediococcus pentosaceus. Although documented before as a component, this is the first report of a spelt sourdough fermentation dominated by this homofermentative LAB, characterized by a high acidification rate, ability to utilize a wide range of carbon sources and to grow in high osmolarity conditions. Yeast communities resulted in four dominant species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Wickerhamomyces anomalus, Pichia fermentans and Clavispora lusitaniae. This study highlights for the first time the biodiversity and dynamics of yeast communities involved in sourdough fermentation of spelt. Compared to commercial baker's yeast, autochthonous W. anomalus, P. fermentans and S. cerevisiae isolates show a good performance, and their use could be an advantage for their acquired adaptation to the environment, providing stability to the fermentation process.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681226>Temporal Dynamics of the Soil Metabolome and  During Simulated Anaerobic Soil Disinfestation.</a></h2><p>Significant interest exists in engineering the soil  to attain suppression of soil-borne plant diseases. Anaerobic soil disinfestation (ASD) has potential as a biologically regulated disease control method; however, the role of specific metabolites and microbial community dynamics contributing to ASD mediated disease control is mostly uncharacterized. Understanding the trajectory of co-evolutionary processes leading to syntrophic generation of functional metabolites during ASD is a necessary prelude to the predictive utilization of this disease management approach. Consequently, metabolic and microbial community profiling were used to generate highly dimensional datasets and network analysis to identify sequential transformations through aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, and anaerobic soil phases of the ASD process and distinct groups of metabolites and microorganisms linked with those stages. Transient alterations in abundance of specific microbial groups, not consistently accounted for in previous studies of the ASD process, were documented in this time-course study. Such events initially were associated with increases and subsequent diminution in highly labile metabolites conferred by the carbon input. Proliferation and dynamic compositional changes in the Firmicutes community continued throughout the anaerobic phase and was linked to temporal changes in metabolite abundance including accumulation of small chain organic , methyl sulfide compounds, hydrocarbons, and -cresol with antimicrobial properties. Novel potential modes of disease control during ASD were identified and the importance of the amendment and "community metabolism" for temporally supplying specific classes of labile compounds were revealed.Copyright © 2019 Hewavitharana, Klarer, Reed, Leisso, Poirier, Honaas, Rudell and Mazzola.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672153>Effect of Enterococcus faecalis 2001 on colitis and depressive-like behavior in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice: involvement of the brain-gut axis.</a></h2><p>Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including those with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, have higher rates of psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety; however, the mechanism of psychiatric disorder development remains unclear. Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut  is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic  bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus.

While these risk factors have been established for over 40 years, the definition of MetS warrants reconsideration in light of the substantial data that have emerged from studies of the gut . In this Review we present the existing recent literature that supports the gut 's potential influence on the various risk factors of MetS. The interplay of the intestinal  with host metabolism has been shown to be mediated by a myriad of factors, including a defective gut barrier, bile  metabolism, antibiotic use, and the pleiotropic effects of microbially produced metabolites. These data show that events that start in the gut, often in response to external cues such as diet and circadian disruption, have far-reaching effects beyond the gut.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664902>Analysis of the fecal  of fast- and slow-growing rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).</a></h2><p>Diverse microbial communities colonizing the intestine of fish contribute to their growth, digestion, nutrition, and immune function. We hypothesized that fecal samples representing the gut  of rainbow trout could be associated with differential growth rates observed in fish breeding programs. If true, harnessing the functionality of this  can improve the profitability of aquaculture. The first objective of this study was to test this hypothesis if gut  is associated with fish growth rate (body weight).

The second objective of this study was to compare the effects of five commonly used DNA extraction methods on the  profiling and to determine the most appropriate extraction method for this study. These methods were Promega-Maxwell, Phenol-chloroform, MO-BIO, Qiagen-Blood/Tissue, and Qiagen-Stool. Methods were compared according to DNA integrity, cost, feasibility and inter-sample variation based on non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination (nMDS) clusters.Differences in DNA extraction methods resulted in significant variation in the identification of bacteria that compose the gut . Promega-Maxwell had the lowest inter-sample variation and was therefore used for the subsequent analyses. Beta diversity of the bacterial communities showed significant variation between breeding families but not between the fast- and slow-growing fish. However, an indicator analysis determined that cellulose, amylose degrading and amino  fermenting bacteria (Clostridium, Leptotrichia, and Peptostreptococcus) are indicator taxa of the fast-growing fish. In contrary, pathogenic bacteria (Corynebacterium and Paeniclostridium) were identified as indicator taxa for the slow-growing fish.DNA extraction methodology should be carefully considered for accurate profiling of the gut . Although the  was not significantly different between the fast- and slow-growing fish groups, some bacterial taxa with functional implications were indicative of fish growth rate. Further studies are warranted to explore how bacteria are transmitted and potential usage of the indicator bacteria of fast-growing fish for development of probiotics that may improve fish health and growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611620>Isolation, characterization and identification of antigenotoxic and anticancerous indigenous probiotics and their prophylactic potential in experimental colon carcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer, the third most commonly diagnosed cancer, is a lifestyle disease where diet and gut  contribute intricately in its initiation and progression. Prophylactic bio-interventions mainly probiotics offer an alternate approach towards reducing or delaying its progression. Therefore, the present study was designed wherein a robust protocol for the isolation, characterization, and identification of indigenous probiotics having antigenotoxic and anticancerous activity was followed along with their prophylactic potential assessment in early experimental colorectal carcinogenesis. Among forty-six isolated lactic  bacterial strains, only three were selected on the basis of antigenotoxicity against N,N-Dimethyl dihydrazine dihydrochloride and 4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide and probiotic attributes. All three selected probiotic strains exhibited anticancerous potential as is evident by the reduced Aberrant Crypt Foci, reduced fecal pH, enhanced fecal lactic  bacteria and altered fecal enzymes (β-glucuronidase, nitroreductase, β-glucosidase) that modulated gut  and microenvironment resulting into restored histoarchitecture of the colon. The results are a clear indicator of the prophylactic potential of selected indigenous probiotics which may be used as an alternative prophylactic biological therapy against colon carcinogenesis particularly in highly susceptible individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614770>The Effects and Mechanisms of Cyanidin-3-Glucoside and Its Phenolic Metabolites in Maintaining Intestinal Integrity.</a></h2><p>Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) is a well-known natural anthocyanin and possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship among layer breed, microbial structure and odor production.Thirty Hy-Line Gray and thirty Lohmann Pink laying hens were used in this study to determine the impact of cecal microbial structure on odor production of laying hens. The hens were managed under the same husbandry and dietary regimes. Results of in vivo experiments showed a lower hydrogen sulfide (HS) production from Hy-Line hens and a lower concentration of soluble sulfide (S) but a higher concentration of butyrate in the cecal content of the Hy-Line hens compared to Lohmann Pink hens (P < 0.05), which was consistent with the in vitro experiments (P < 0.05). However, ammonia (NH) production was not different between genotypes (P > 0.05). Significant microbial structural differences existed between the two breed groups. The relative abundance of some butyrate producers (including Butyricicoccus, Butyricimonas and Roseburia) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (including Mailhella and Lawsonia) were found to be significantly correlated with odor production and were shown to be different in the 16S rRNA and PCR data between two breed groups. Furthermore, some bacterial metabolism pathways associated with energy extraction and carbohydrate utilization (oxidative phosphorylation, pyruvate metabolism, energy metabolism, two component system and secretion system) were overrepresented in the Hy-Line hens, while several amino  metabolism-associated pathways (amino  related enzymes, arginine and proline metabolism, and alanine-aspartate and glutamate metabolism) were more prevalent in the Lohmann hens.The results of this study suggest that genotype of laying hens influence cecal , which in turn modulates their odor production.

Six multiparous lactating Holstein cows were used in a crossover design (two treatments × two periods). The control treatment (CON) was based on a diet including 50% of grass silage, whereas the experimental treatment (TAN) included grass silage sprayed with OTE (26 g/kg DM) just before baling. Milk yield (on average 24 kg fat protein corrected milk per day) was not affected, but both milk and rumen fatty  profiles were impacted by OTE. Nitrogen intake (415 g N per cow per day) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE; 0.25 on average) were not affected, but a shift from urine (-8% of N intake relatively to control, P = 0.06) to faecal N (+5%; P = 0.004) was observed with the TAN diet (P ≤ 0.05). Nitrogen apparent digestibility was thus reduced for TAN (-3%; P ≤ 0.05). The effect of OTE on ruminal and milk FA profiles suggests an impact on rumen . Nitrogen isotopic discrimination between animal proteins and diet (Δ15N) was evaluated as a proxy for NUE. While no differences in NUE were observed across diets, a lower Δ15N of plasma proteins was found when comparing TAN v. CON diets. This finding supports the concept that Δ15N would mainly sign the N partitioning at the metabolic level rather than the overall NUE, with the latter also being impacted by digestive processes. Our results agree with a N shift from urine to faeces, and this strategy can thus be adopted to decrease the environmental impact of ruminant protein feeding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641822>HS-SPME-GC-MS approach for the analysis of volatile salivary metabolites and application in a case study for the indirect assessment of gut .</a></h2><p>In this work, a straightforward analytical approach based on headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was developed for the analysis of salivary volatile organic compounds without any prior derivatization step. With a sample volume of 500 μL, optimal conditions were achieved by allowing the sample to equilibrate for 10 min at 50 °C and then extracting the samples for 10 min at the same temperature, using a carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane fibre. The method allowed the simultaneous identification and quantification of 20 compounds in sample headspace, including short-chain fatty  and their derivatives which are commonly analysed after analyte derivatization. The proof of applicability of the methodology was performed with a case study regarding the analysis of the dynamics of volatile metabolites in saliva of a single subject undergoing 5-day treatment with rifaximin antibiotic. Non-stimulated saliva samples were collected over 3 weeks from a nominally healthy volunteer before, during, and after antibiotic treatment. The variations of some metabolites, known to be produced by the  and by bacteria that are susceptible to antibiotics, suggest that the study of the dynamics of salivary metabolites can be an excellent indirect method for analysing the gut . This approach is novel from an analytical standpoint, and it encourages further studies combining saliva metabolite profiles and gut  dynamics.

We previously showed that breeding for -resistance in common bean changed the rhizosphere  composition and functioning. Here, we assessed the impact of -resistance breeding in common bean on  physiology. Combined with metatranscriptome data, community-level physiological profiling by Biolog EcoPlate analyses revealed that the rhizosphere  of the -resistant accession was distinctly different from that of the -susceptible accession, with higher consumption of amino  and amines, higher metabolism of xylanase and sialidase, and higher expression of genes associated with nitrogen, phosphorus and iron metabolism. The resistome analysis indicates higher expression of soxR, which is involved in protecting bacteria against oxidative stress induced by a pathogen invasion. These results further support our hypothesis that breeding for resistance has unintentionally shaped the assembly and activity of the rhizobacterial community toward a higher abundance of specific rhizosphere competent bacterial taxa that can provide complementary protection against fungal root infections.Copyright © 2019 Mendes, de Chaves, Fonseca, Mendes, Raaijmakers and Tsai.</p></html>
