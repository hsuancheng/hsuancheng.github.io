It can be caused by infectious or systemic disorders, such as Crohn's disease (CD) and sarcoidosis. It is therefore essential to investigate systematic causes of granulomatous appendicitis after surgery by appropriate examinations. It is also rare for acute appendiceal  to develop due to active CD. We herein report a case of CD presenting as granulomatous appendicitis. The patient was a 28-year-old man who arrived at the emergency room with right lower abdominal pain. Computed tomography showed a low-density lesion with a clear boundary and a small high-density spot in its center behind the cecum. Acute appendicitis with abscess formation was suspected and conservative treatment was started. After 3 consecutive days of conservative treatment there was no improvement in his condition. We therefore performed open appendectomy. Histopathological examination showed numerous noncaseous epithelioid granulomas in the wall of the appendix. Specific staining revealed no evidence of -fast bacilli or fungi. During follow-up after discharge, colonoscopy demonstrated erosion from the cecum to the transverse colon. A colon biopsy showed severe  with cryptitis, Paneth cells, and a granulomatous lesion. The patient was therefore diagnosed with CD and treatment with mesalazine was started. Careful examination is necessary to diagnose and properly treat patients with granulomatous  of the appendix.Copyright © 2019 by S.

Along with obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance, genetic factors strongly impact on NAFLD development and progression. Dysregulated bile  metabolism and the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) pathway play a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis. However, it remains to be defined the mechanism through which the FGF19 receptor system is associated with liver damage in NAFLD.We evaluated the impact of the rs17618244 G>A β-Klotho (KLB) variant on liver damage in 249 pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and the association of this variant with the expression of hepatic and soluble KLB. In vitro models were established to investigate the role of KLB mutant.The KLB rs17618244 variant was associated with increased risk of ballooning and lobular . KLB plasma levels were lower in carriers of the rs17618244 minor A allele and were associated with lobular , ballooning and fibrosis. In HepG2 and Huh7 hepatoma cell lines, exposure to free fatty  caused a severe reduction of intracellular and secreted KLB. Finally, KLB down-regulation obtained by the expression of KLB mutant in HepG2 and Huh7 cells induced intracellular lipid accumulation and up-regulation of p62, ACOX1, ACSL1, IL-1β and TNF-α gene expression.In conclusion, we showed an association between the rs17618244 KLB variant, which leads to reduced KLB expression, and the severity of NAFLD in pediatric patients. We can speculate that KLB protein may exert a protective role against lipotoxicity and  in hepatocytes.Genetic and environmental factors strongly impact on NAFLD pathogenesis and progression. The FGF19/FGFR4/KLB pathway plays a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis, thus, it has been identified as a therapeutic target. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the impact of the KLB rs17618244 G>A genetic variant on liver damage severity in pediatric patients with NAFLD, and the effect of KLB mutant on hepatocellular damage.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

They play three major roles: energy metabolism, structural, and signaling. They are dynamic molecules strongly influenced by endogenous and exogenous factors including genetics, diet, age, lifestyle, drugs, disease and . As precision medicine starts to become mainstream, there is a huge burgeoning interest in lipids and their potential to act as unique biomarkers or prognostic indicators. Lipids comprise a large component of all metabolites (around one-third), and our expanding knowledge about their dynamic behavior is fueling the hope that mapping their regulatory biochemical pathways on a systems level will revolutionize our ability to prevent, diagnose, and stratify major human diseases. Up to now, clinical lipid measurements have consisted primarily of total cholesterol or triglycerides, as a measure for cardiovascular risk and response to lipid lowering drugs. Nowadays, we are able to measure thousands of individual lipids that make up the lipidome. nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR) metabolomics is also being increasingly used in large cohort studies where it can report on total levels of selected lipid classes, and relative levels of fatty  saturation. To support the application of lipidomics research, LIPID MAPS was established in 2003, and since then has gone on to become the go-to resource for several lipid databases, lipid drawing tools, data deposition, and more recently lipidomics informatics tools, and a lipid biochemistry encyclopedia, LipidWeb. Alongside this, the recently established Lipidomics Standards Initiative plays a key role in standardization of lipidomics methodologies.

Despite an increasing amount of people worldwide developing NAFLD and having it progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and potentially cirrhosis, there is still no approved therapy. Therefore, huge efforts are being made to find and develop a successful treatment. One of the special interests is understanding the liver-gut axis and especially the role of bile  in the progression of NAFLD. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-agonists have been approved und used in other liver diseases, such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and have shown signs of being able to decrease  and potentially steatosis. This review will mainly focus on targets/ligands that play an important role in bile  metabolism and give an overview of ongoing clinical as well as pre-clinical trials. With the complexity of the issue, we did not aim at giving a complete review, rather highlighting important targets and potential treatments that could be approved for NAFLD/NASH treatment within the next few years.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624866>Phenolic extracts from whole wheat biofortified bread dampen overwhelming inflammatory response in human endothelial cells and monocytes: major role of VCAM-1 and CXCL-10.</a></h1><p>The aim of the study was to evaluate the vascular health properties of extracts from biofortified bread, obtained by adding different durum wheat milling by-products rich in phenolic compounds, by analyzing their effects on overwhelming inflammatory response in endothelial cells and monocytes, two main players of atherogenesis.Human umbilical vein endothelial cells or U937 monocytes were incubated with increasing concentrations (1, 5, 10 μg/mL) of biofortified bread polyphenol extracts or corresponding pure phenolic  before stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We analyzed the endothelial-monocyte adhesion and related endothelial adhesion molecules. The expression of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines was also measured in LPS-stimulated endothelial cells and monocytes as well as intracellular oxidative stress.Biofortified bread extracts inhibited monocyte adhesion to LPS-stimulated endothelial cells, in a concentration-dependent manner by reducing mainly endothelial VCAM-1 expression. Phenolic  extracts contained in 10 mg biofortified bread downregulated the LPS-induced expression of chemokines MCP-1, M-CSF, and CXCL-10 as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β, in endothelial cells and monocytes, with CXCL-10 as the most reduced inflammatory mediator. Among phenolic  of biofortified bread, ferulic, sinapic, and p-coumaric  significantly inhibited the LPS-stimulated CXCL-10 expression in vascular cells. The reduced pro-inflammatory response was related to a slightly but significant reduction of intracellular oxidative stress.Our findings suggest the bread biofortified with selected durum wheat milling by-products as a source of phenolic  with multiple anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic properties, which could help to counteract or prevent inflammatory vascular diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671330>Obeticholic  prevents carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis through interaction between farnesoid X receptor and Smad3.</a></h1><p>Liver fibrosis results from sustained liver injury and is characterized by , hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation, extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation and liver structure destruction. The Farnesoid-X receptor (FXR) antagonizes toxic liver injury and fibrosis, yet the mechanism in liver fibrosis remains unclear. We investigated the effects of FXR agonist obeticholic  (OCA) on liver fibrosis in mice. Mice were injected with carbon tetrachloride (CCl) for 3 weeks or 6 weeks to induce liver fibrosis. OCA (5 mg/kg) or PBS is administered daily during CCl-treatment. At sacrifice, biochemical parameters and fibrosis were assessed. Pretreatment with OCA alleviated hepatic injury in 6 weeks group but not in 3 weeks group of CCl liver cirrhosis. At same time, pretreatment with OCA exhibit a dramatic protection of liver fibrosis in both 3 weeks group and 6 weeks group. Further experiments found that OCA pretreatment inhibited α-SMA expression and the activation of hepatic pSmad3 in 3 weeks group and 6 weeks group of CCl-induced liver cirrhosis. Moreover, OCA activated FXR nuclear translocation and increased the interaction between liver FXR and pSmad3. This led to the discovery of a novel role for FXR in regulating fibrosis through interaction with pSmad3. Our data suggest that CCl-induced liver fibrosis is protected by OCA through interaction between farnesoid X receptor and Smad3.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The present study investigated the fatty  composition of  egg lipids and their anti-inflammatory effects on LPS-stimulated RAW246.7 macrophages. The results showed that  egg lipids contained primarily polyunsaturated fatty  (52.9% of the total fatty  content; mostly eicosapentaenoic  [EPA, 21.2 ± 0.5%] and docosahexaenoic  [DHA, 25.9 ± 0.1%]), followed by monounsaturated fatty  and saturated fatty  (23.7% and 23.4%, respectively).  egg lipids significantly decreased nitric oxide (NO) production and suppressed the expression of immune-associated genes such as , , , , and  LPS-stimulated RAW246.7 macrophages in dose-dependent manner.  egg lipids also reduced the phosphorylation levels of NF-κB p-65, p38, ERK1/2, and JNK, key components of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, suggesting that the lipid-induced anti-inflammatory activity is related to these signaling pathways. These results indicate that the lipids extracted from  eggs have potential biofunctions and might be useful for regulating  in macrophages.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615107>Exosomes: Versatile Nano Mediators of Immune Regulation.</a></h1><p>One of many types of extracellular vesicles (EVs), exosomes are nanovesicle structures that are released by almost all living cells that can perform a wide range of critical biological functions. Exosomes play important roles in both normal and pathological conditions by regulating cell-cell communication in cancer, angiogenesis, cellular differentiation, osteogenesis, and . Exosomes are stable in vivo and they can regulate biological processes by transferring lipids, proteins, nucleic , and even entire signaling pathways through the circulation to cells at distal sites. Recent advances in the identification, production, and purification of exosomes have created opportunities to exploit these structures as novel drug delivery systems, modulators of cell signaling, mediators of antigen presentation, as well as biological targeting agents and diagnostic tools in cancer therapy. This review will examine the functions of immunocyte-derived exosomes and their roles in the immune response under physiological and pathological conditions.

Adult-male SD rats (n=40) were equally divided into group 1 (sham-operated control), group 2 (ICH), group 3 (ICH + hyaluronic  (HA)/intracranial injection at 3 h after ICH), group 4 [ICH + HA + iPSC-MSC (1.2 × 10 cells/intracranial injection at 3 h after ICH)] and euthanized by day 28 after ICH procedure. In vitro study showed that hemorrhagic-brain tissue augmented protein expressions of  (HMGB1/MyD88/TLR-4/TLR-2/NF-κB/TNF-α/iNOS/IL-1β) in cultured neurons that were significantly inhibited by iPSC-MSC treatment (all P<0.001). By days 7 and 14 after ICH procedure, circulating inflammatory levels of TNF-α/IL-6/MPO expressed were lowest in group 1, highest in group 2 and significantly lower in group 4 than in group 3 (all P<0.0001). By day 14 after ICH procedure, neurological function and BIV expressed an opposite pattern, whereas protein expressions of  (HMGB1/MyD88/TLR-4/TLR-2/NF-κB/I-kB/TNF-α/iNOS/IL-1β/MMP-9), oxidative stress (NOX-1/NOX-2/oxidized protein) and apoptosis (mitochondrial-Bax/cleaved-caspase-2/PARP) in brain exhibited an identical pattern to circulating  among the four groups (all P<0.001). Microscopy demonstrated that the number of vascular remodeling and GFAP+/53BP1+/γ-H2AX+ cells displayed an identical pattern of , whereas the NeuN+ cells displayed an opposite pattern of  among the four groups (all P<0.001). In conclusion, iPSC-MSC therapy markedly reduced BIV and preserved neurological function mainly by inhibiting inflammatory/oxidative-stress generation.AJTR Copyright © 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649645> subsp.

It secretes unusually shaped nanotubular outer membrane vesicles (OMV) loaded with a number of virulence factors and immunoreactive proteins. In the present study, the vesicles were purified from a clinical isolate of subsp.  strain FSC200. We here provide a comprehensive proteomic characterization of OMV using a novel approach in which a comparison of OMV and membrane fraction is performed in order to find proteins selectively enriched in OMV vs. membrane. Only these proteins were further considered to be really involved in the OMV function and/or their exceptional structure. OMV were also isolated from bacteria cultured under various cultivation conditions simulating the diverse environments of  life cycle. These included conditions mimicking the milieu inside the mammalian host during : oxidative stress, low pH, and high temperature (42°C); and in contrast, low temperature (25°C). We observed several-fold increase in vesiculation rate and significant protein cargo changes for high temperature and low pH. Further proteomic characterization of stress-derived OMV gave us an insight how the bacterium responds to the hostile environment of a mammalian host through the release of differentially loaded OMV. Among the proteins preferentially and selectively packed into OMV during stressful cultivations, the previously described virulence factors connected to the unique intracellular trafficking of  were detected. Considerable changes were also observed in a number of proteins involved in the biosynthesis and metabolism of the bacterial envelope components like O-antigen, lipid A, phospholipids, and fatty .

The receptor responsible for succinate signalling, SUCNR1 (also known as GPR91), is a member of the G-protein-coupled-receptor family and links succinate signalling to renin-induced hypertension, retinal angiogenesis and . Because SUCNR1 senses succinate as an immunological danger signal-which has relevance for diseases including ulcerative colitis, liver fibrosis, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis-it is of interest as a therapeutic target. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of rat SUCNR1 in complex with an intracellular binding nanobody in the inactive conformation. Structure-based mutagenesis and radioligand-binding studies, in conjunction with molecular modelling, identified key residues for species-selective antagonist binding and enabled the determination of the high-resolution crystal structure of a humanized rat SUCNR1 in complex with a high-affinity, human-selective antagonist denoted NF-56-EJ40. We anticipate that these structural insights into the architecture of the succinate receptor and its antagonist selectivity will enable structure-based drug discovery and will further help to elucidate the function of SUCNR1 in vitro and in vivo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650328>Successful elevation of circulating acetate and propionate by dietary modulation does not alter T-regulatory cell or cytokine profiles in healthy humans: a pilot study.</a></h1><p>Increased circulating concentrations of short-chain fatty  (SCFA) achieved by ingestion of high-fibre diets is associated with anti-inflammatory effects through promotion of FoxP3+ regulatory T(reg) cells in mouse models. This study aimed to determine whether similar increments in blood SCFA levels can be achieved in humans and whether these are associated with similar immune modulatory effects.In a pilot single-blinded, randomised, controlled cross-over study in ten healthy subjects, the effects were determined of high- (39 g/day) and low-fibre (18 g/day) intake (all food provided) on SCFA (gas chromatography), proportions of Treg cells (flow cytometry) and a panel of cytokines (multiplex methodology) measured in peripheral blood at day 5 of each diet.Actual fibre intake differed between the diets by 19 [16-21] g/day (P< 0.001). Median [range] total plasma SCFA levels with high-fibre intake were 174.5 [104.8-249.5] µmol/L, which were greater than those associated with low-fibre intake at 59.0 [26.5-79.9] (P < 0.001). Differences were significantly different for both acetate and propionate. The frequencies of total CD4 T cells and T-regulatory cells, and concentrations of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines were not significantly different between the dietary interventions.Plasma SCFA levels can be modulated by altering dietary fibre consumption in healthy individuals with increments similar to those achieved in murine studies. Five days of diet intervention did not result in changes in regulatory T-cell proportions and cytokine concentrations in peripheral blood, and may require longer duration of dietary change.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632234>Increased Maternal Prenatal Adiposity, , and Lower Omega-3 Fatty  Levels Influence Child Negative Affect.</a></h1><p>Increased maternal adiposity during pregnancy is associated with offspring risk for psychiatric disorders.  secondary to adiposity is believed to be an important mechanism through which this effect occurs. Although increased adiposity introduces risk, not all children of overweight mothers develop these problems. Gestational factors that modify this risk are not well-understood. If maternal increased adiposity exerts its effects on offspring outcomes by increasing  in the gestational environment, then anti-inflammatory inputs such as omega-3 fatty  may be one protective factor. The goal of this study was to investigate whether maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and omega-3 fatty  levels independently and/or interactively predicted offspring infant negative affect, an early life marker of risk for psychopathology.Data came from a prospective study of women recruited during pregnancy and their 6 month old infants ( = 62; 40% female). Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was pulled from medical charts and third trimester omega-3 fatty  concentrations were assessed in plasma. Child negative affect was assessed using observer- and maternal-ratings at 6 months of age. Maternal  was indexed by third trimester plasma levels of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1.Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was associated with increased infant negative affect whereas eicosapentaenoic  was associated with less infant negative affect. Maternal omega-3 fatty  levels moderated the effect of BMI on infant negative affect, such that omega-3 fatty  buffered children against the negative consequences of increased adiposity. Supporting the role of maternal  in these associations, maternal BMI and omega-3 fatty  levels interacted to predict maternal third trimester . Further, maternal  was associated with increased infant negative affect.Results suggest that omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy may protect against offspring behavioral risk associated with increased maternal adiposity.Copyright © 2019 Gustafsson, Holton, Anderson, Nousen, Sullivan, Loftis, Nigg and Sullivan.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659697>Dissecting the target leukocyte subpopulations of clinically relevant  radiopharmaceuticals.</a></h1><p>Leukocyte subtypes bear distinct pro-inflammatory, reparative, and regulatory functions.

We evaluated leukocyte subtype specificity of characterized clinically relevant -targeted radiotracers.Leukocyte populations were purified from blood- and THP-1-derived macrophages were polarized into M1-, reparative M2a-, or M2c-macrophages. In vitro uptake assays were conducted using tracers of enhanced glucose or amino  metabolism and molecular markers of inflammatory cells. Both F-deoxyglucose (F-FDG) and the labeled amino  C-methionine (C-MET) displayed higher uptake in neutrophils and monocytes compared to other leukocytes (P = 0.005), and markedly higher accumulation in pro-inflammatory M1-macrophages compared to reparative M2a-macrophages (P < 0.001). Molecular tracers Ga-DOTATATE targeting the somatostatin receptor type 2 and Ga-pentixafor targeting the chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) exhibited broad uptake by leukocyte subpopulations and polarized macrophages with highest uptake in T-cells/natural killer cells and B-cells compared to neutrophils. Mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO)-targeted F-flutriciclamide selectively accumulated in monocytes and pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages (P < 0.001). Uptake by myocytes and fibroblasts tended to be higher for metabolic radiotracers.The different in vitro cellular uptake profiles may allow isolation of distinct phases of the inflammatory pathway with specific -targeted radiotracers.

The most abundant source to isolate MSCs is adipose tissue. Currently, perirenal adipose tissue is rarely described as the source of MSCs. MSCs were isolated from perirenal adipose tissue (prASCs) from patients undergoing tumor nephrectomies, cultured and characterized by flow cytometry and their differentiation potential into adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteoblasts and epithelial cells. Furthermore, prASCs were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic  (LTA) or a mixture of cytokines (cytomix). In addition, prASC susceptibility to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) was investigated. The expression of inflammatory readouts was estimated by qPCR and immunoassay. HCMV infection was analyzed by qPCR and immunostaining. Characterization of cultured prASCs shows the cells meet the criteria of MSCs and prASCs can undergo trilineage differentiation. Cultured prASCs can be induced to differentiate into epithelial cells, shown by cytokeratin 18 expression. Stimulation of prASCs with LPS or cytomix suggests the cells are capable of initiating an -like response upon stimulation with LPS or cytokines, whereas, LTA did not induce a significant effect on the readouts (ICAM-1, IL-6, TNFα, MCP-1 mRNA and IL-6 protein). HCMV broadly infects prASCs, showing a viral load dependent cytopathological effect (CPE).

Inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion are implicated in myocardial infarction (MI) and resultant heart failure; however, little is known about how macrophage lysosomes regulate these processes. In mice subjected to cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury and humans with ischemic cardiomyopathy, we observed evidence of lysosomal impairment in macrophages. Inducible macrophage-specific overexpression of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis (Mϕ-TFEB), attenuated postinfarction remodeling, decreased abundance of proinflammatory macrophages, and reduced levels of myocardial IL-1β compared with controls. Surprisingly, neither inflammasome suppression nor Mϕ-TFEB-mediated attenuation of postinfarction myocardial dysfunction required intact ATG5-dependent macroautophagy (hereafter termed "autophagy"). RNA-seq of flow-sorted macrophages postinfarction revealed that Mϕ-TFEB upregulated key targets involved in lysosomal lipid metabolism. Specifically, inhibition of the TFEB target, lysosomal  lipase, in vivo abrogated the beneficial effect of Mϕ-TFEB on postinfarction ventricular function. Thus, TFEB reprograms macrophage lysosomal lipid metabolism to attenuate remodeling after IR, suggesting an alternative paradigm whereby lysosome function affects .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645121>Anti-Inflammatory Effects of  in Macrophage Cells and DSS-Induced Colitis Mouse Model.</a></h1><p>, known as sword bean, has been used as a Chinese traditional medicine for anti-inflammatory effects. However, the action mechanisms of sword bean have not yet been clearly defined. In the present study, the whole parts of a ripened sword bean (RSB) and the green sword bean (GSB) containing bean pod were extracted with ethanol by reflux extraction. The two crude extracts (RSBE and GSBE) from RSB and GSB were validated by a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis of gallic  as a reference chemical. The anti-inflammatory effects of two sword bean extracts were extensively investigated using LPS-stimulated macrophage cells. First, RSBE and GSBE significantly inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin-6 (IL-6), prostaglandinE (PGE), and nitric oxide (NO) in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. RSBE and GSBE showed no cytotoxicity to RAW264.7 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophage cells. In addition, the overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) induced by LPS in RAW264.7 cells was significantly decreased by RSBE and GSBE. Western blotting and immunostaining analysis showed that RSBE and GSBE inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-B subunits, which correlated with the inhibitory effects on inhibitor kappa B (IB) degradation. In dextran sulfated sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice model, RSBE restored body weight, colon length, and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-, IL-6, interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interferon- (IFN-).

It is initiated by antigen-mediated receptor stimulation that triggers store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) via ORAI1 calcium channel.  (FM) is widely used to treat allergic diseases such as allergic rhinitis and asthma. Although many studies have reported that FM regulates intracellular calcium signaling, research on the exact type of calcium channel modulated by FM is scarce. Therefore, we hypothesized that the anti-allergic effects of FM might result from ORAI1 inhibition in T cells. We investigated whether a 70% ethanolic extract of FM (FM and its constituents inhibit ORAI1 channel activity and subsequent T cell activation. We performed conventional whole-cell patch clamp studies in hSTIM1 and hORAI1-overexpressing HEK293T cells (HEK. Intracellular calcium concentration was determined using Fura-2 dye and cytokine production measurement in Jurkat T lymphocytes. FM (0.03 mg/mL) and its fractions, especially hexane fraction (FM, 0.01 mg/mL), significantly inhibited SOCE and IL-2 cytokine production in Jurkat T lymphocytes. GC/MS analysis showed linoleic  (LA) as the major component of FM. FM at 0.01 mg/mL (equivalent to 10 M LA) inhibited not only SOCE but also IL-2 production, as well as CD3/CD28 receptor co-stimulation induced calcium signaling in Jurkat T lymphocytes.

CD1d can also bind non-activating lipids, such as sphingomyelin. We hypothesized that these serve as endogenous regulators and investigated humans and mice deficient in  sphingomyelinase (ASM), an enzyme that degrades sphingomyelin. We show that ASM absence in mice leads to diminished CD1d-restricted antigen presentation and iNKT cell selection in the thymus, resulting in decreased iNKT cell levels and resistance to iNKT cell-mediated inflammatory conditions. Defective antigen presentation and decreased iNKT cells are also observed in ASM-deficient humans with Niemann-Pick disease, and ASM activity in healthy humans correlates with iNKT cell phenotype. Pharmacological ASM administration facilitates antigen presentation and restores the levels of iNKT cells in ASM-deficient mice. Together, these results demonstrate that control of non-agonistic CD1d-associated lipids is critical for iNKT cell development and function in vivo and represents a tight link between cellular sphingolipid metabolism and immunity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611941>Role of bile  in the diagnosis and progression of liver cirrhosis: A prospective observational study.</a></h1><p>The accumulation of toxic bile  (BAs) is closely related to liver injury,  and tumorigenesis.

The concentrations of total BAs, glycocholic  (GCA), glycochenodeoxycholic  (GCDCA), taurocholic  (TCA), taurochenoxycholic  and tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) were increased significantly in patients with early cirrhosis compared to patients with chronic hepatitis (P<0.05) and were associated with the diagnosis of cirrhosis (P=0.049, 0.004, 0.002, 0.003, 0.010 and 0.009, respectively). The levels of total BAs, primary conjugated BAs, and TUDCA increased as liver cirrhosis progressed (P<0.05). Serum total BAs, GCA, GCDCA, and TCA predicted the 6-month survival of patients with liver cirrhosis (P=0.0003, 0.005, 0.002, and 0.010 respectively). Based on multivariate Cox regression analysis, the level of total BAs was an independent predictor of mortality in cirrhotic patients (hazard ratios, 4.046; 95% CI, 1.620-10.108; P=0.003). In the early-stage cirrhosis group, the concentrations of total BAs and primary conjugated BAs were significantly elevated in patients with CC-HCC compared with patients with cirrhosis alone. In conclusion, total and individual BAs, especially primary conjugated BAs, are effective non-invasive markers in the diagnosis and prognosis of liver cirrhosis, and may be potential indicators in the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with early cirrhosis.Copyright: © Liu et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620593>Antiepileptic and anti-neuroinflammatory effects of red ginseng in an intrahippocampal kainic  model of temporal lobe epilepsy demonstrated by electroencephalography.</a></h1><p>Chronic  can lower the seizure threshold and have influence on epileptogenesis. The components of red ginseng (RG) have anti-inflammatory effects. The abundance of peripherally derived immune cells in resected epileptic tissue suggests that the immune system is a potential target for anti-epileptogenic therapies. The present study used continuous electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of RG in intrahippocampal kainic  (IHKA) animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy.Prolonged status epilepticus (SE) was induced in 7-week-old C57BL/6J mice via stereotaxic injection of kainic  (KA, 150 nL; 1 mg/mL) into the right CA3/dorsal hippocampus. The animals were implanted electrodes and monitored for spontaneous seizures. Following the IHKA injections, one group received treatments of RG (250 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks (RG group, n=7) while another group received valproic  (VPA, 30 mg/kg/day) (VPA group, n=7). Laboratory findings and pathological results were assessed at D29 and continuous (24 h/week) EEG monitoring was used to evaluate high-voltage sharp waves on D7, D14, D21, and D28.At D29, there were no differences between the groups in liver function test but RG group had higher blood urea nitrogen levels. Immunohistochemistry analyses revealed that RG reduced the infiltration of immune cells into the brain and EEG analyses showed that it had anticonvulsant effects.Repeated treatments with RG after IHKA-induced SE decreased immune cell infiltration into the brain and resulted in a marked decrease in electrographic seizures. RG had anticonvulsant effects that were similar to those of VPA without serious side effects.Copyright © 2018 Yeungnam University College of Medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618622>Effects of controlled cortical impact and docosahexaenoic  on rat pup fatty  profiles.</a></h1><p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of acquired neurologic disability in children, particularly in those under four years old. During this period, rapid brain growth demands higher Docosahexaenoic  (DHA) intake. DHA is an essential fatty  and brain cell component derived almost entirely from the diet. DHA improved neurologic outcomes and decreased  after controlled cortical impact (CCI) in 17-day old (P17) rats, our established model of pediatric TBI. In adult rodents, TBI decreases brain DHA. We hypothesized that CCI would decrease rat brain DHA at post injury day (PID) 60, blunted by 0.1% DHA diet. We quantitated fatty  using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. We provided 0.1% DHA before CCI to ensure high DHA in dam milk. We compared brain DHA in rats after 60 days of regular (REG) or DHA diet to SHAM pups on REG diet. Brain DHA decreased in REGCCI, not in DHACCI, relative to SHAMREG. In a subsequent experiment, we gave rat pups DHA or vehicle intraperitoneally after CCI followed by DHA or REG diet for 60 days. REG increased brain Docosapentaenoic  (n-6 DPA, a brain DHA deficiency marker) relative to SHAMDHA and DHACCI pups (p < 0.001, diet effect). DHA diet nearly doubled DHA and decreased n-6 DPA in blood but did not increase brain DHA content (p < 0.0001, diet effect). We concluded that CCI or craniotomy alone induces a mild DHA deficit as shown by increased brain DPA.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to investigate inhibition of acute and chronic inflammations and cytotoxic activity of extracts, fractions, and isolated compounds from L. ochrophylla.Hexane (HE) and ethanol (EE) extracts obtained from stem bark of L. ochrophylla were submitted to chromatographic fractionation. In order to test acute , experimental model of impact injury was used, followed by transdermal application of gels using phonophoresis. Histological analysis was based on scores assigned by the capacity of decreasing the lesion. To evaluate the effect EE and fractions on cell proliferation, human lymphocytes were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and analyzed using flow cytometry. Proliferation was measured using VPD 450 staining and the calculated proliferative index (PI). The cytotoxic activity was evaluated using MTT colorimetric method against MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, HCT-116, and Vero cells. GraphPad Prism Version 5 was used for statistical analysis.HE and EE provided friedelin, β-friedelinol, lupeol, mixture of lupeol and pseudotaraxasterol, β-sitosterol, betulinic , mixture of lupeol and taraxasterol, (-)-epicatechin, β-sitosterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, and (+)-epicatechin-(4β-8)-epicatechin. HE, ethyl acetate fraction (AF), betulinic , and β-sitosterol promoted regeneration of muscle fibers caused by muscle injury. AF significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the lymphocyte proliferation index (1.36 for cultures stimulated with PHA, 0.7 for untreated cultures and 0.12 for cultures stimulated with PHA and treated with AF 25 μg/mL and AF 50 μg/mL, respectively). β-Sitosterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside exhibited high cytotoxic activity (IC = 1.279 μg/mL) against HCT-116 cell line.These results suggest that extracts, fractions, and chemical constituents from L. ochrophylla decreases inflammatory processes generated by muscle injury. The anti-inflammatory activity may be justified by high inhibition of T cell proliferation. These extracts, fractions, and chemical constituents from L. ochrophylla may be useful as a therapeutic agent against rheumatic diseases.

The ongoing  increase the chemotaxis of neutrophils to inflamed site providing to their overaccumulation. The pharmacological reduction of neutrophil migration can be limited by suppression of major chemoattractants (IL-8, IL-1β and TNF-α) release and downregulation of adhesive molecules.During a screening of plants traditionally used in respiratory tracts diseases (e.g. cough, rhinitis, bronchitis, throat infection, fever, influenza) in Europe, we have selected roots of Inula helenium and aerial parts of Grindelia squarrosa as a potential source of compounds limiting neutrophil migration.The effect on IL-8, IL-1β and TNF-α release by neutrophils and respiratory epithelium cell line (A549) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The surface expression of adhesive molecules was analyzed with flow cytometry, and the neutrophil attachment to the epithelial cells was assessed fluorimetrically.We confirmed the ability of selected extracts and compounds to suppress neutrophil binding to the epithelium surface via downregulation of β2 integrin. Compared with a positive controls, budesonide and clarithromycin selected compounds, alantolactone and grindelic  have been shown a comparable inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-8, TNF-α, IL-1β).The present study demonstrated that the Inula helenium and Grindelia squarrosa, which have been traditionally used in Europe as medicinal plants, are a valuable source of active compounds with anti-inflammatory activity.

The hepatic endocannabinoid and apelin systems are two signalling pathways with a substantial role in the liver fibrosis pathophysiology-both are upregulated in patients with advanced liver disease. Endogenous cannabinoids are lipid-signalling molecules derived from arachidonic  involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular dysfunction, portal hypertension, liver fibrosis, and other processes associated with hepatic disease through their interactions with the CB and CB receptors. Apelin is a peptide that participates in cardiovascular and renal functions, , angiogenesis, and hepatic fibrosis through its interaction with the APJ receptor. The endocannabinoid and apelin systems are two of the multiple cell-signalling pathways involved in the transformation of quiescent hepatic stellate cells into myofibroblast like cells, the main matrix-producing cells in liver fibrosis. The mechanisms underlying the control of hepatic stellate cell activity are coincident despite the marked dissimilarities between the endocannabinoid and apelin signalling pathways. This review discusses the current understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the hepatic endocannabinoid and apelin systems play a significant role in the pathophysiology of liver fibrosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670612>Mammalian transient receptor potential TRPA1 channels: from structure to disease.</a></h1><p>The Transient Receptor Potential Ankyrin TRPA channels are Ca-permeable non-selective cation channels remarkably conserved through the animal kingdom. Mammals have only one member, TRPA1, which is widely expressed in sensory neurons and in non-neuronal cells (such as epithelial cells and hair cells). TRPA1 owes its name to the presence of 14 ankyrin repeats located in the N-terminus of the channel, an unusual structural feature that may be relevant to its interactions with intracellular components. TRPA1 is primarily involved in the detection of an extremely wide variety of exogenous stimuli that may produce cellular damage. This include a plethora of electrophilic compounds that interact with nucleophilic amino  residues in the channel, and many other chemically-unrelated compounds whose only common feature seems to be their ability to partition in the plasma membrane. TRPA1 has been reported to be activated by cold, heat and mechanical stimuli, and its function is modulated by multiple factors, including Ca, trace metals, pH, and reactive oxygen, nitrogen and carbonyl species. TRPA1 is involved in acute and chronic pain, , plays a role in the pathophysiology of nearly all organ systems and is an attractive target for the treatment of related diseases. Here we review the current knowledge about the mammalian TRPA1 channel, linking its unique structure, widely tuned sensory properties and complex regulation to its roles in multiple pathophysiological conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672993>Plasticity of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis respiratory chain and its impact on tuberculosis drug development.</a></h1><p>The viability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) depends on energy generated by its respiratory chain. Cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase and type-2 NADH dehydrogenase (NDH-2) are respiratory chain components predicted to be essential, and are currently targeted for drug development. Here we demonstrate that an Mtb cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase deletion mutant is viable and only partially attenuated in mice. Moreover, treatment of Mtb-infected marmosets with a cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase inhibitor controls disease progression and reduces lesion-associated , but most lesions become cavitary. Deletion of both NDH-2 encoding genes (Δndh-2 mutant) reveals that the essentiality of NDH-2 as shown in standard growth media is due to the presence of fatty . The Δndh-2 mutant is only mildly attenuated in mice and not differently susceptible to clofazimine, a drug in clinical use proposed to engage NDH-2.

This condition may lead to kidney fibrosis with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and myofibroblast formation. Inhibition of chronic effects of kidney I/R injury may provide effective strategies for treating AKI and chronic kidney diseases (CKDs). Chlorogenic  (CGA) is recognized as a powerful antioxidant, with anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties in many conditions. However, the effect of CGA on kidney I/R injury has not been elucidated yet. Kidney I/R injury was performed on male Swiss background mice (I/R group,  = 5, 3-4 months, 30-40 g) which underwent bilateral renal pedicles clamping for 30 minutes and then were euthanized on day three after operation. Three groups of I/R were treated with 3 different doses of CGA intraperitoneally for 2 days: 3.5 (I/R + CGA1 group), 7 (I/R + CGA2 group), and 14 (I/R + CGA3 group) mg/kg of body weight. Tubular injury was quantified based on Periodic -Schiff staining, while reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to quantify mRNA expression of TGF-1, vimentin, SOD-1, TLR-4, TNF-α, NF-κB and MCP-1. Immunohistochemical staining was done to quantify proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), myofibroblast (-SMA), SOD-1 and macrophage (CD68) number. Kidney I/R demonstrated tubular injury and increased inflammatory mediator expression, macrophage number, and myofibroblast expansion. Meanwhile, histological analysis showed lower tubular injury with higher epithelial cell proliferation in CGA-treated groups compared to the I/R group. RT-PCR also revealed significantly lower TGF-1 and vimentin mRNA expressions with higher SOD-1 mRNA expression. CGA-treated groups also demonstrated a significantly lower macrophage and myofibroblast number compared to the I/R group. These findings associated with lower mRNA expression of TLR-4, TNF-α, NF-κB, and MCP-1 as inflammatory mediators in CGA groups. I/R + CGA3 represented the highest amelioration effect among other CGA-treated groups. CGA treatment attenuates kidney I/R injury through reducing , decreasing myofibroblast expansion, and inducing epithelial cells proliferation.Copyright © 2019 Nur Arfian et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627414>Sargassum Seaweed as a Source of Anti-Inflammatory Substances and the Potential Insight of the Tropical Species: A Review.</a></h1><p> is recognized both empirically and scientifically as a potential anti-inflammatory agent.  is an important response in the body that helps to overcome various challenges to body homeostasis such as microbial infections, tissue stress, and certain injuries.

This paper assesses the preventive and therapeutic effect of BBD on hepatic encephalopathy after liver cirrhosis (CHE) and acute liver failure (AHE) in rats and explains its possible mechanism.The establishment of CHE and AHE rat models: hepatic fibrosis and acute liver failure rat model established by injection of carbon tetrachloride (CCl) were pretreated with BBD and then induced into hepatic encephalopathy by injection of thioacetamide (TAA). Preventive and therapeutic effect of BBD on brain dysfunction, liver injury, pathology and fibrosis were evaluated in vivo. The role of BBD in the regulation of inflammatory factors and myeloid differentiation factor 88/Toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor kappa-B (TLR4/MyD88/NK-κ B) pathway were detected in both liver and brain in vivo. The rat BMDMs were activated by Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the role of BBD in regulation of inflammatory factors and NK-κ B pathway were detected in vitro.In CHE rat model: the total distance and activity rate of the rats with the low dose BBD (BL), high dose BBD (BH) and Lactulose (L) groups significantly improved, and the BH group improved most obviously. BBD can effectively reduce ammonia levels. The levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), total bilirubin (TBil) and total bile  (TBA) in CHE rats after BBD intervention were significantly lower, and TP and Alb levels were significantly higher. In the liver, BBD not only inhibited the gene expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), interleukini-6 (IL-6), TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κ B, but also inhibited the protein expression of TLR4, MyD88, NK-κ B and TNF-a. In the brain, BBD inhibited the gene expression of iNOS, IL-6, TNF-a, TLR-4, M yD88, and NF-κ B, as well as inhibited the protein expression of TLR4, MyD88, P65 TNF-α and ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1). In the blood, NO and TNF-α were also improved by BBD. In AHE rats model: BBD improved neurological score and blood ammonia and inhibited brain inflammatory gene expression of iNOS, TNF-α and IL-1β. BBD also improved liver function markers such as ALT, AST, TBiL, TBA, TP, Alb and inhibited inflammatory and apoptotic gene expression of genes such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-9, caspase-3 and NF-κ B. In LPS-activated rat bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM), BBD decreased NO and TNF-α production in BMDM culture supernatant. In addition, BBD inhibited the gene expression of TNF-α, IL-1 β and IL-6 as well as the phosphorylation of P65.BBD could prevent and cure hepatic encephalopathy derived from both chronic and acute liver diseases. Here, we found that except for the direct improvement of blood and brain ammonia level,  is likely an important target of BBD to treat hepatic encephalopathy. The anti-inflammatory role of BBD may lie in its regulation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κ B pathways.Copyright © 2019.

HA breakdown is a feature of the acute stage of stroke injury and may be detrimental through enhancement of the inflammatory response. Recent studies have shown that knockout mice lacking hyaluronic  synthetase demonstrates epileptic phenotype  and removal of HA leads to delayed development of epileptiform activity in cultured hippocampal neurons . Here, we studied whether digestion of hyaluronic  in the hippocampus in early postnatal period can trigger seizures. Hyaluronidase (Hyal) (5 U/μl) was bilaterally injected into C57BL/6j mice (P17) CA1 field of hippocampus using the stereotaxic method to remove hyaluronan-based ECM. Transcriptome analysis of hippocampal tissue 2 h after enzymatic digestion of hyaluronan-based brain ECM revealed increased gene expression of proteins involved in  reactions (TLR2, CCL2,3,5), neuroinflammation, axonal guidance and ephrin receptor signaling, versus the vehicle group. Mice injected with hyaluronidase exhibited delayed audiogenic seizures and improvement in working memory 72 h after injection, while there were no changes in locomotor activity, anxious level and exploratory behavior due to the open field test. The obtained results point to a link between the activation of neuroinflammation by enzymatic digestion of hyaluronan-based brain ECM during the neonatal period and their subsequent reactivity to seizures, which may play an important role in the functional features of the developing brain, including its seizure propensity.Copyright © 2019 Balashova, Pershin, Zaborskaya, Tkachenko, Mironov, Guryev, Kurbatov, Gainullin and Mukhina.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619061>Replacing Saturated Fat With Unsaturated Fat in Western Diet Reduces Foamy Monocytes and Atherosclerosis in Male  Mice.</a></h1><p>A Mediterranean diet supplemented with olive oil and nuts prevents cardiovascular disease in clinical studies, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. We investigated whether the preventive effect of the diet could be due to inhibition of atherosclerosis and foamy monocyte formation in  mice fed with a diet in which milkfat in a Western diet (WD) was replaced with extra-virgin olive oil and nuts (EVOND). Approach and Results:  mice were fed EVOND or a Western diet for 3 (or 6) months. Compared with the Western diet, EVOND decreased triglyceride and cholesterol levels but increased unsaturated fatty  concentrations in plasma. EVOND also lowered intracellular lipid accumulation in circulating monocytes, indicating less formation of foamy monocytes, compared with the Western diet. In addition, compared with the Western diet, EVOND reduced monocyte expression of inflammatory cytokines, CD36, and CD11c, with decreased monocyte uptake of oxLDL (oxidized LDL [low-density lipoprotein]) ex vivo and reduced CD11c foamy monocyte firm arrest on vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin-coated slides in an ex vivo shear flow assay. Along with these changes, EVOND compared with the Western diet reduced the number of CD11c macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions and lowered atherosclerotic lesion area of the whole aorta and aortic sinus.A diet enriched in EVOND, compared with a Western diet high in saturated fat, lowered plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, inhibited foamy monocyte formation, , and adhesion, and reduced atherosclerosis in  mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669586>Altered N-glycan profile of IgG-depleted serum proteins in Hashimoto's thyroiditis.</a></h1><p>Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic  of thyroid gland. Although HT is the most common cause of hypothyroidism, the pathogenesis of this disease is not fully understood. Glycosylation of serum proteins was examined in HT only to a limited extent. The study was designed to determine the glycosylation pattern of IgG-depleted sera from HT patients.Serum N-glycans released by N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) digestion were analyzed by normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (NP-HPLC). N-glycan structures in each collected HPLC fraction were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and exoglycosidase digestion. Fucosylation and sialylation was also analyzed by lectin blotting.The results showed an increase of monosialylated tri-antennary structure (A3G3S1) and disialylated diantennary N-glycan with antennary fucose (FA2G2S2). Subsequently, we analyzed the serum N-glycan profile by lectin blotting using lectins specific for fucose and sialic . We found a significant decrease of Lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA) staining in HT samples, which resulted from the reduction of α1,6-linked core fucose in HT serum. We also observed an increase of Maackia amurensis II lectin (MAL-II) reaction in HT due to the elevated level of α2,3-sialylation in HT sera.The detected alterations of serum protein sialylation might be caused by chronic  in HT. The obtained results completed our previous IgG N-glycosylation analysis in autoimmune thyroid patients and showed that the altered N-glycosylation of serum proteins is characteristic for autoimmunity process in HT.Thyroid autoimmunity is accompanied by changes of serum protein sialylation.Copyright © 2019.

Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty  (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658997> triggers liver X receptor-dependent lipogenesis.</a></h1><p>Immune cell function can be modulated by changes in lipid metabolism.

The -dependent increase in lipogenesis requires induction of the liver X receptors, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors, by type I interferons in response to inflammatory signals. Instead of the well-established role for liver X receptors in stimulating cholesterol efflux, we demonstrate that liver X receptors are necessary for the proper resumption of cholesterol synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Thus, liver X receptors function as bidirectional regulators of cholesterol homeostasis driving efflux when cholesterol levels are high and facilitating synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Liver X receptor activity is also required for the proper shutdown of a subset of type I interferon-stimulated genes as  subsides, placing the receptors in a negative feedback loop that may contribute to resolution of the inflammatory response.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645086>Pharmacological properties and therapeutic potential of saffron (Crocus sativus L.) in osteosarcoma.</a></h1><p>In this comprehensive study, we aimed to investigate pharmacological properties and therapeutic significance of saffron in osteosarcoma cancer cells.Plant materials were obtained from Safranbolu district of Karabuk, Turkey.

Possible reasons for the NAFLD epidemic in industrialized countries are the high intake of pro-inflammatory n-6 polyunsaturated fatty  (n-6 PUFAs) and low consumption of healthy n-3 PUFAs. Due to their anti-inflammatory properties, n-3 PUFAs may have the potential to alleviate chronic liver disease. Herein, we examined the therapeutic effect of increased n-3 PUFA tissue levels in fat-1 transgenic mice on progressive NASH.Disease was induced in mice by streptozotocin and high fat diet (STZ/HFD) resulting in NASH. NAFLD in 6 and 8 weeks old wild type and fat-1 transgenic STZ/HFD treated mice was analyzed. Unlike all other mammals, fat-1 transgenic mice ubiquitously express an n-3 fatty  desaturase, which converts n-6 to n-3 PUFAs, leading to increased n-3 and decreased n-6 PUFA tissue contents.Liver damage, NAFLD activity score (NAS), hepatic lipid accumulation and  were significantly reduced in fat-1 transgenic STZ/HFD treated mice in the early (6 weeks) but not late (8 weeks) phase of NASH. Simultaneously, mRNA expression of genes involved in fatty  uptake and storage ( and , respectively) was significantly down-regulated in 6 week old but not 8 week old fat-1 transgenic STZ/HFD treated mice.Endogenously elevated n-3 PUFA levels in fat-1 transgenic mice transiently delay the onset of STZ/HFD induced NASH but failed to efficiently protect from NASH development.2019 Hepatobiliary Surgery and Nutrition.

Nutritional status has a clear relationship with disease outcomes, and malnutrition in CF is typically a result of chronic negative energy balance secondary to malabsorption. As the mechanisms underlying the pathology of CF and its implications on nutrient absorption and energy expenditure have been elucidated, nutrition support has become increasingly sophisticated. Comprehensive nutrition monitoring and treatment guidelines from professional and advocacy organizations have unified the approach to nutrition optimization around the world. Newborn screening allows for early nutrition intervention and improvement in short- and long-term growth and other clinical outcomes. The nutrition support goal in CF care includes achieving optimal nutritional status to support growth and pubertal development in children, maintenance of optimal nutritional status in adult life, and optimizing fat soluble vitamin and essential fatty  status. The mainstay of this approach is a high calorie, high-fat diet, exceeding age, and sex energy intake recommendations for healthy individuals. For patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, enzyme replacement therapy is required to improve fat and calorie absorption. Enzyme dosing varies by age and dietary fat intake. Multiple potential impediments to absorption, including decreased motility, altered gut luminal bile salt and microbiota composition, and enteric  must be considered. Fat soluble vitamin supplementation is required in patients with pancreatic insufficiency. In this report, nutrition support across the age and disease spectrum is discussed, with a focus on the relationships among nutritional status, growth, and disease outcomes.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639005>Therapeutic effect and autophagy regulation of myriocin in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h1><p>Ceramide plays pathogenic roles in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) via multiple mechanisms, and as such inhibition of ceramide de novo synthesis in the liver may be of therapeutically beneficial in patients with NAFLD. In this study, we aimed to explore whether inhibition of ceramide signaling by myriocin is beneficial in animal model of NAFLD via regulating autophagy.Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: standard chow (n = 10), high-fat diet (HFD) (n = 10) or HFD combined with oral administration of myriocin (0.3 mg/kg on alternate days for 8 weeks) (n = 10). Liver histology and autophagy function were measured. HepG2 cells were incubated with fatty  with or without myriocin treatment. Lipid accumulation and autophagy markers in the HepG2 cells were analyzed. Serum ceramide changes were studied in 104 subjects consisting healthy adults, liver biopsy-proven patients with NAFLD and liver biopsy-proven patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Myriocin reversed the elevated body weight and serum transaminases and alleviated dyslipidemia in HFD fed rats. Myriocin treatment significantly attenuated liver pathology including steatosis, lobular  and ballooning. By qPCR analysis, it was revealed that myriocin corrected the expression pattern of fatty  metabolism associated genes including Fabp1, Pparα, Cpt-1α and Acox-2. Further, myriocin also restored the impaired hepatic autophagy function in rats with HFD-induced NASH, and this has been verified in HepG2 cells. Among the sphingolipid species that we screened in lipidomic profiles, significantly increased ceramide was observed in NASH patients as compared to the controls and non-NASH patients, regardless of whether or not they have active CHB.Ceramide may play an important regulatory role in the autophagy function in the pathogenesis of NASH. Hence, blockade of ceramide signaling by myriocin may be of therapeutically beneficial in NASH.Registration ID: ChiCTR-DDT-13003983 .

At 4 and 6 day-post infection, 5 birds from each treatment group and their controls were bled for serum. Global metabolomic profiles were assessed using ultra performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (metabolon, Inc.,). Statistical analyses were based on analysis of variance to identify which biochemicals differed significantly between experimental groups. Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted to identify significant pathways associated with response to E. acervulina infection.A total of 752 metabolites were identified across genotype, treatment and time post infection. Altered fatty  (FA) metabolism and β-oxidation were identified as dominant metabolic signatures associated with E. acervulina infection. Key metabolite changes in FA metabolism included stearoylcarnitine, palmitoylcarnitine and linoleoylcarnitine. The infection induced changes in nucleotide metabolism and elicited inflammatory reaction as evidenced by changes in thromboxane B2, 12-HHTrE and itaconate.Serum metabolome of two chicken genotypes infected with E. acervulina demonstrated significant changes that were treatment-, time post-infection- and genotype-dependent. Distinct metabolic signatures were identified in fatty , nucleotide,  and oxidative stress biochemicals. Significant microbial associated product alterations are likely to be associated with malabsorption of nutrients during infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661911>The Sequence and a Three-Dimensional Structural Analysis Reveal Substrate Specificity Among Snake Venom Phosphodiesterases.</a></h1><p>(1) Background. Snake venom phosphodiesterases (SVPDEs) are among the least studied venom enzymes. In envenomation, they display various pathological effects, including induction of hypotension, inhibition of platelet aggregation, edema, and paralysis. Until now, there have been no 3D structural studies of these enzymes, thereby preventing structure-function analysis. To enable such investigations, the present work describes the model-based structural and functional characterization of a phosphodiesterase from   venom, named PDE_ (2) Methods. The PDE_ structure model was produced and validated using various software (model building: I-TESSER, MODELLER 9v19, Swiss-Model, and validation tools: PROCHECK, ERRAT, Molecular Dynamic Simulation, and Verif3D). (3) Results. The proposed model of the enzyme indicates that the 3D structure of PDE_ comprises four domains, a somatomedin B domain, a somatomedin B-like domain, an ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase domain, and a DNA/RNA non-specific domain. Sequence and structural analyses suggest that differences in length and composition among homologous snake venom sequences may account for their differences in substrate specificity. Other properties that may influence substrate specificity are the average volume and depth of the active site cavity. (4) Conclusion. Sequence comparisons indicate that SVPDEs exhibit high sequence identity but comparatively low identity with mammalian and bacterial PDEs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653948>Comparing modes of delivery of a combination of ion channel inhibitors for limiting secondary degeneration following partial optic nerve transection.</a></h1><p>Injury to the central nervous system is exacerbated by secondary degeneration. Previous research has shown that a combination of orally and locally administered ion channel inhibitors following partial optic nerve injury protects the myelin sheath and preserves function in the ventral optic nerve, vulnerable to secondary degeneration. However, local administration is often not clinically appropriate. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of systemic and local delivery of the ion channel inhibitor combination of lomerizine, brilliant blue G (BBG) and YM872, which inhibits voltage-gated calcium channels, P2X receptors and Ca permeable α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic  (AMPA) receptors respectively. Following a partial optic nerve transection, adult female PVG rats were treated with BBG and YM872 delivered via osmotic mini pump directly to the injury site, or via intraperitoneal injection, both alongside oral administration of lomerizine. Myelin structure was preserved with both delivery modes of the ion channel inhibitor combination. However, there was no effect of treatment on , either peripherally or at the injury site, or on the density of oligodendroglial cells. Taken together, the data indicate that even at lower concentrations, the combinatorial treatment may be preserving myelin structure, and that systemic and local delivery are comparable at improving outcomes following neurotrauma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629028>Anti-inflammatory properties of Xylopia aethiopica leaves: Interference with pro-inflammatory cytokines in THP-1-derived macrophages and flavonoid profiling.</a></h1><p>Ethnopharmacological surveys on Guinea-Bissauan flora reveal that several species are used to treat or ameliorate the symptomatology of conditions with an inflammatory background. As such, extracts obtained from a series of plants recorded in those surveys were screened for their anti-inflammatory properties, a hydroethanolic extract obtained from the leaves of Xylopia aethiopica (Dunal) A. Rich, (Annonaceae), used on the treatment of headache, muscular pain and rheumatic pain, scoring positively and being further investigated.In order to identify species with anti-inflammatory properties, extracts were screened for their ability to interfere with LPS-induced TNF-α levels. Since significant effects were recorded upon treatment with the extract of the leaves obtained from X. aethiopica, further assays were conducted to elucidate additional mechanisms underlying its anti-inflammatory potential. Since little is known on the chemical composition of the plant, we also aimed to characterise its phenolic profile.Interference with cytokines was evaluated by ELISA assay, through the quantification of TNF-α and IL-6 levels in the culture medium collected from LPS-activated THP-1-derived-macrophages. Inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase was assessed based on the oxidation of linoleic  to 13-hydroperoxylinoleic . Characterization of the phenolic profile was attained by HPLC-DAD.Evaluation of TNF-α levels in LPS-challenged THP-1 macrophages evidenced a significant inhibition (>90%) upon treatment with the hydroethanolic extract obtained from X. aethiopica leaves at a concentration of 500 μg/mL. Additional anti-inflammatory effects were recorded, including a significant decrease on IL-6 levels at 250 and 500 μg/mL. The extract proved to be active towards 5-LOX, leading to significant inhibition at concentrations ranging from 16 to 250 μg/mL (IC = 85 μg/mL). Phenolic profiling allowed the identification and quantitation of eight constituents, including caffeoylquinic  (1-3), mono-O-glycosylated flavonols (5-8), and the mono-O-glycosyl flavone luteolin-7-O-glucoside (4). The main phenolic constituent, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (8), was found to significantly contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects, namely through the inhibition of 5-LOX. However, no effects on the decrease of TNF-α and IL-6 levels caused by this phenolic compound were found.The anti-inflammatory effects of X. aethiopica leaves are demonstrated experimentally, thus substantiating its use in folk Medicine. Relevantly, the observed anti-inflammatory properties can stimulate further studies in order to fully unveil the therapeutic potential of the plant, namely as a source of phenolic compounds with a significant ability to interfere with conventional inflammatory targets.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Oxidative stress, free radicals, and neuritis have important roles in MS pathogenesis. Here, we aim to evaluate the effect of crocin on inflammatory markers, oxidative damage, and deoxyribonucleic  (DNA) damage in the blood of patients with MS. A total of 40 patients were divided into two groups, drug and placebo-treated groups, using random assignment. Participants of the intervention and control groups received two crocin capsules or placebo per day for 28 days, respectively. Findings revealed a significant decrease in the level of important pathogenic factors in MS, including lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin 17 as well as a significant increase in the total antioxidant capacity in the serum of patients treated with crocin compared with the placebo group.

Sofalcone contains a 1,3-diaryl-2-propen-1-one moiety, which is a common chemical scaffold in naturally occurring chalcones. The α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group (Michael reaction acceptor) has electrophilic properties. We investigated the biochemical mechanisms by which sofalcone activated the cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory nuclear factor-erythroid 2 (NF-E2) p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-heme oxygenase (HO)-1 pathway. Furthermore, we investigated whether the activation of this pathway was involved in sofalcone -mediated protective effects in an experimental colitis model. Sofalcone induced HO-1 protein expression, which was dependent on increased nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 in human colon carcinoma cells. In addition, Sofalcone reacted with nucleophilic thiol compounds to form Michael adducts. A reduced form of sofalcone (SFCR) in which the Michael reaction acceptor was deactivated, did not exert biological or chemical activity. Biotin-tagged sofalcone bound to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), a cytosolic repressor of Nrf2. This binding was prevented by pretreatment with sofalcone and a thiol compound but not with SFCR. Furthermore, sofalcone treatment induced dissociation of the Nrf2-KEAP1 complex. Rectal administration of sofalcone alleviated colon damage and  and increased colon nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 and HO-1 levels in a dinitrobenzene sulfonic -induced rat colitis model. The protective effects of sofalcone against colon damage and  were significantly inhibited by co-administration of an HO-1 inhibitor. In conclusion, sofalcone activated the Nrf2-HO-1 pathway by covalently binding to KEAP1 via Michael addition, and may confer anti-colitic effects by inducing Nrf2 activation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In the present randomized trial, we aimed to evaluate the effect of enteral glutamine supplementation on clinical outcomes, gut permeability, systemic , oxidative stress, and plasma glutamine levels in patients with severe and predicted severe AP.Patients with AP admitted within 72 h of onset of symptoms were included. The primary outcome measure was development of infected pancreatic and peri-pancreatic necrosis and in-hospital mortality. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HS-CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were evaluated as markers of ; plasma thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) and activities of serum superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were determined to evaluate oxidative stress; serum polyethylene glycol (PEG) was tested for intestinal permeability; subjective global assessment (SGA) was used for nutritional assessment, and an improvement in organ function was measured by the Modified Marshall score. Intention-to-treat analysis was used. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.After power calculation, we enrolled 18 patients in the glutamine and 22 in the control arm. There was no significant improvement in the development of infected necrosis and in-hospital mortality between the groups. Improvement in Modified Marshall score was observed in a higher proportion of patients receiving glutamine (15 [83.3%] vs. 12 [54.5%]; p = 0.05). Plasma glutamine levels improved more in glutamine-treated group (432.72 ± 307.83 vs. 618.06 ± 543.29 μM/L; p = 0.004), while it was lower in controls (576.90 ± 477.97 vs. 528.20 ± 410.45 μM/L; p = 0.003).

To enhance the therapeutic efficacy of curcumin, we exploited polymeric prodrug strategy. Here, we report rationally designed -activatable curcumin polymer (ACP), as a therapeutic prodrug of curcumin, in which curcumin was covalently incorporated in the backbone of amphiphilic polymer. ACP could self-assemble to form micelles that rapidly release curcumin under the acidic condition. The potential of ACP micelles as therapeutics for osteoarthritis was evaluated using a mouse model of monoidoacetic  (MIA)-induced knee osteoarthritis. ACP micelles drastically protected the articular structures from arthritis through the suppression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β). Given their pathological stimulus-responsiveness and potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, ACP micelles hold remarkable potential as a therapeutic agent for not only osteoarthritis but also various inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2019.

EETs elicit endothelial angiogenic activity linked to tumor growth in various cancer models that can be attenuated in vivo by COX-2 inhibitors. This study further defines the relationship between endothelial EET metabolism and COX-2 in promoting angiogenesis. Using human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), we quantified 8,9-EET-induced tube formation and cell migration as indicators of angiogenic potential, in the presence and absence of a COX-2 inducer (PDBu). Although PDBu itself was potent in increasing angiogenic markers, 8,9-EET in combination with PDBu elicited a 1.3-fold larger response than 8,9-EET alone, and compared to PDBu. Contributing to this response were 8,9-EET metabolites formed from COX-2, the 11-hydroxy-8,9-EET (8,9,11-EHET) and 15-hydroxy-8,9-EET (8,9,15-EHET). When exogenously dosed into HAEC, synthetic 8,9,11-EHET enhanced angiogenesis at all concentrations tested, whereas 8,9,15-EHET was inactive. Tube formation by 8,9,11-EHET was independent of PI3K-Akt, p38 MAPK, and MEK signaling. These results indicate that 8,9-EET-stimulated angiogenesis is enhanced by COX-2 metabolism in endothelium through formation of 8,9,11-EHET. This lipid mediator may play a role in regulating physiological angiogenesis, and it may be especially important under circumstances where COX-2 is induced, such as in cancer tumor growth and . Finally, the generation of 8, 9, 11-EHET from 8, 9-EET may help explain why EETs are weakly angiogenic under some conditions yet block tumor growth under other conditions.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635166>Proteomic Analysis of 3T3-L1 Adipocytes Treated with Insulin and TNF-α.</a></h1><p>Insulin resistance is an indication of early stage Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Insulin resistant adipose tissues contain higher levels of insulin than the physiological level, as well as higher amounts of intracellular tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and other cytokines. However, the mechanism of insulin resistance remains poorly understood. To better understand the roles played by insulin and TNF-α in insulin resistance, we performed proteomic analysis of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with insulin (Ins), TNF-α (TNF), and both (Ins + TNF). Out of the 693 proteins identified, the abundances of 78 proteins were significantly different ( < 0.05). Carnitine parmitoyltransferase-2 (CPT2), acetyl CoA carboxylase 1 (ACCAC-1), ethylmalonyl CoA decarboxylase (ECHD1), and methylmalonyl CoA isomerase (MCEE), enzymes required for fatty  β-oxidation and respiratory electron transport, and β-glucuronidase, an enzyme responsible for the breakdown of complex carbohydrates, were down-regulated in all the treatment groups, compared to the control group. In contrast, superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), and glutathione reductase, which are the proteins responsible for cytoskeletal structure, protein folding, degradation, and oxidative stress responses, were up-regulated. This suggests higher oxidative stress in cells treated with Ins, TNF, or both.

Mice with impaired macrophage activation, when fed a high-fat diet, develop severe NASH. Evidence is mounting that Kupffer cells are implicated. However, it is unknown whether the resident CD68 or bone marrow-derived CD11b Kupffer cells are involved. Characterization of the FSP1cre-Pparb/d mouse liver revealed that FSP1 is expressed in CD11b Kupffer cells. Although these cells only constitute a minute fraction of the liver cell population,  deletion in these cells led to remarkable hepatic phenotypic changes. We report that a higher lipid content was present in postnatal day 2 (P2) FSP1cre- livers, which diminished after weaning. Quantification of total lipids and triglycerides revealed that P2 and week 4 of age FSP1cre- livers have higher levels of both. qPCR analysis also showed upregulation of genes involved in fatty  β-oxidation, and fatty  and triglyceride synthesis pathways. This result is further supported by western blot analysis of proteins in these pathways.

Accumulating data implicate a potential role of disturbed tryptophan metabolism in IBD. Kynurenic  (KYNA), a derivative of tryptophan (TRP) along the kynurenine (KYN) pathway, displays cytoprotective and immunomodulating properties, whereas 3-OH-KYN is a cytotoxic compound, generating free radicals.The expression of lymphocytic mRNA encoding enzymes synthesizing KYNA (KAT I-III) and serum levels of TRP and its metabolites were evaluated in 55 patients with IBD, during remission or relapse [27 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 28 patients with Crohn's disease (CD)] and in 50 control individuals.The increased expression of KAT1 and KAT3 mRNA characterized the entire cohorts of patients with UC and CD, as well as relapse-remission subsets. Expression of KAT2 mRNA was enhanced in patients with UC and in patients with CD in remission. In the entire cohorts of UC or CD, TRP levels were lower, whereas KYN, KYNA and 3-OH-KYN were not altered. When analysed in subsets of patients with UC and CD (active phase-remission), KYNA level was significantly lower during remission than relapse, yet not  control. Functionally, in the whole groups of patients with UC or CD, the TRP/KYN ratio has been lower than control, whereas KYN/KYNA and KYNA/3-OH-KYN ratios were not altered. The ratio KYN/3-OH-KYN increased approximately two-fold among all patients with CD; furthermore, patients with CD with relapse, manifested a significantly higher KYNA/3-OH-KYN ratio than patients in remission.The presented data indicate that IBD is associated with an enhanced expression of genes encoding KYNA biosynthetic enzymes in lymphocytes; however, additional mechanisms appear to influence KYNA levels. Higher metabolic conversion of serum TRP in IBD seems to be followed by the functional shift of KYN pathway towards the arm producing KYNA during exacerbation. We propose that KYNA, possibly  interaction with aryl hydrocarbon receptor or G-protein-coupled orphan receptor 35, may serve as a counter-regulatory mechanism, decreasing cytotoxicity and  in IBD. Further longitudinal studies evaluating the individual dynamics of TRP and KYN pathway in patients with IBD, as well as the nature of precise mechanisms regulating KYNA synthesis, should be helpful in better understanding the processes underlying the observed changes.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626791>5-HT receptor activation alleviates airway  and structural remodeling in a chronic mouse asthma model.</a></h1><p>Although the bulk of research into the biology of serotonin 5-HT receptors has focused on its role in the CNS, selective activation of these receptors in peripheral tissues can produce profound anti-inflammatory effects. We previously demonstrated that the small molecule 5-HT receptor agonist (R)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine [(R)-DOI] inhibits TNF-α-mediated proinflammatory signaling cascades and  via 5-HT receptor activation and prevents the development of, and  associated with, acute allergic asthma in a mouse ovalbumin (OVA) model. Here, we investigated the ability of (R)-DOI to reverse  and symptoms associated with established asthma in a newly developed model of chronic asthma.An 18-week ovalbumin challenge period was performed to generate persistent, chronic asthma in BALB/c mice. Four once daily intranasal treatments of (R)-DOI were administered one week after allergen cessation, with respiratory parameters being measured by whole-body plethysmography (WBP). Cytokine and chemokine levels were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in homogenized lung tissue, bronchoalveolar (BALF) fluid was analyzed for chemokine modulation by multiplex assays, and Periodic -Schiff and Masson's Trichrome staining was performed to determine goblet cell infiltration and overall changes to lung morphology.5-HT activation via (R)-DOI attenuates elevated airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine, reduces pulmonary  and mucus production, and reduces airway structural remodeling and collagen deposition by nearly 70%.Overall, these data provide support for the therapeutic potential of (R)-DOI and 5-HT receptor activation for the treatment of asthma, and identifies (R)-DOI as a novel therapeutic compound against pulmonary fibrosis.Copyright © 2019.

We previously identified a series of indole-based OXE receptor antagonists that rapidly appear in the blood following oral administration but have limited lifetimes. The objective of this study was to increase the potency and plasma half-lives of these compounds and thereby identify the optimal candidate for future preclinical studies in monkeys, since rodents do not have an OXE receptor ortholog.We synthesized a series of substituted phenylalkyl indoles and compared their antagonist potencies, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism to those of our earlier compounds. The potencies of some of their metabolites were also investigated.Among the compounds tested, the S-enantiomer of the m-chlorophenyl compound (S-Y048) was the most potent, with an pIC of about 10.8 for inhibition of 5-oxo-ETE-induced calcium mobilization in human neutrophils. When administered orally to cynomolgus monkeys, S-Y048 rapidly appeared in the blood and had a half-life in plasma of over 7 h, considerably longer than any of the other OXE analogs tested. A major hydroxylated metabolite, with a potency close to that of its precursor, was identified in plasma.Because of its highly potent antagonist activity and its long lifetime in vivo, S-Y048 may be a useful anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of eosinophilic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis.This article is protected by copyright.

We hypothesize that adult-onset lymphocyte-predominant esophagitis is also an immune-mediated inflammatory pattern, the nature of which has been masked by other conditions that feature esophageal lymphocytosis and occur in older patients. We performed this study to consolidate diagnostic criteria for lymphocyte-predominant esophagitis and determine its clinical significance. We identified 61 patients with lymphocyte-rich  in the mid or proximal esophagus, none of whom had another explanation for esophageal lymphocytosis. Affected patients were usually older adults and 72% were women. Most (56%) presented with dysphagia and 34% had eosinophilic esophagitis-like changes with rings, exudates, and/or edematous mucosa and linear furrows. Intraepithelial lymphocytosis was accompanied by mucosal injury featuring edema, basal zone hyperplasia, and scattered dyskeratotic cells. Some cases displayed occasional neutrophils or even superficial microabscesses; eosinophils were consistently infrequent. Most (67%) patients had at least 1 systemic immune-mediated disorder, particularly Crohn disease (30%) and connective tissue diseases (23%); only 1 had mucocutaneous lichen planus. We conclude that mild mucosal lymphocytosis (ie, ≥20 lymphocytes/HPF) alone is a frequent and nonspecific finding; criteria for lymphocyte-predominant esophagitis should include evidence of mucosal injury and allow for more than the occasional neutrophil. When this diagnosis is limited to cases that feature lymphocytosis unattributed to  reflux, motility disorders, or infection, lymphocyte-predominant esophagitis may represent an immune-mediated disorder with characteristic clinical manifestations and a predilection for middle-aged women.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638593>Targeting the Infant Gut Microbiota Through a Perinatal Educational Dietary Intervention: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h1><p>The early life gut microbiota are an important regulator of the biological pathways contributing toward the pathogenesis of noncommunicable disease. It is unclear whether improvements to perinatal diet quality could alter the infant gut microbiota.The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a perinatal educational dietary intervention in influencing gut microbiota in mothers and infants 4 weeks after birth.The Healthy Parents, Healthy Kids randomized controlled trial aimed to recruit 90 pregnant women from Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. At week 26 of gestation, women were randomized to receive dietary advice from their doctor (n=45), or additionally receive a dietary intervention (n=45). The intervention included an educational workshop and 2 support calls aiming to align participants' diets with the Australian Dietary Guidelines and increase intakes of prebiotic and probiotic foods. The educational design focused on active learning and self-assessment. Behavior change techniques were used to support dietary adherence, and the target behavior was eating for the gut microbiota. Exclusion criteria were age under 18 years, diagnosed mental illnesses, obesity, diabetes mellitus, diagnosed bowel conditions, exclusion diets, illicit drug use, antibiotic use, prebiotic or probiotic supplementation, and those lacking dietary autonomy. The primary outcome measure is a between-group difference in alpha diversity in infant stool collected 4 weeks after birth. Secondary outcomes include evaluating the efficacy of the intervention in influencing infant and maternal stool microbial composition and short chain fatty  concentrations, epigenetic profile, and markers of  and stress, as well as changes in maternal dietary intake and well-being. The study and intervention feasibility and acceptance will also be evaluated as secondary outcomes.The study results are yet to be written. The first participant was enrolled on July 28, 2016, and the final follow-up assessment was completed on October 11, 2017.Data from this study will provide new insights regarding the ability of interventions targeting the perinatal diet to alter the maternal and infant gut microbiota. If this intervention is proven, our findings will support larger studies aiming to guide the assembly of gut microbiota in early life.Australian Clinical Trials Registration Number ACTRN12616000936426; https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=370939.DERR1-10.2196/14771.©Samantha L L.

The regularity and intensity of exercise is modulated at the molecular level in the skeletal muscle by two protein kinases, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which act as sensors of external stimuli, showing the energy status of muscular fibers. The mTOR pathway is activated by insulin and amino  availability, and its metabolic actions culminate in increased protein synthesis and reduced autophagy, leading to an increase in muscle mass. In contrast, AMPK activation induces a transcriptional program aimed to increase the mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, transforming fast-twitch glycolytic fibers to slow-twitch oxidative fibers and increasing resistance to fatigue. In addition, inadequate exercise training induces imbalance in the immune response, generating excessive  and/or immunosuppression. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that provide insight into dietary protein interventions and/or amino  supplementation that may improve outcomes after exercise by modulating 1) mTOR and AMPK activation during early exercise recovery, leading to increased muscle protein synthesis or increased oxidative capacity; 2) undesirable inflammatory responses; and 3) fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels that may have relevant implications in skeletal muscle metabolism, particularly during the exercise recovery and performance of obese subjects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Linoleic  (LA) and α-linolenic  (ALA) are members of two classes of PUFAs, namely the n-6 and n-3 series, which are required for normal human health. Both are considered precursors of a cascade of molecules (eicosanoids), which take part in many biological processes (, vasoconstriction/vasodilation, thromboregulation, etc.). However, their biological functions are opposite and are mainly related to the form (precursor or long-chain products) in which they were administered and to the enzyme-substrate preference. ALA is widely present in common vegetable oils and foods, marine algae, and natural herbs, whereas its long-chain PUFA derivatives are available mainly in fish and animal product origins. Recent studies have shown that the accumulation of n-3 PUFAs seems mostly to be tissue-dependent and acts in a tissue-selective manner. Furthermore, dietary n-3 PUFAs widely affect the lipid oxidation susceptibility of all tissues. In conclusion, sustainable sources of n-3 PUFAs are limited and exert a different effect about (1) the form in which they are administered, precursor or derivatives; (2) their antioxidant protections; and (3) the purpose to be achieved (health improvement, physiological and reproductive traits, metabolic pathways, etc.).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632109>Plant-derived oleanolic  ameliorates markers associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in a diet-induced pre-diabetes rat model.</a></h1><p>The increased prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients is becoming a worldwide health burden. Studies have indicated, however, that the onset of NAFLD occurs during pre-diabetes, a condition that often precedes the onset of T2DM. Oleanolic  has been reported to improve glucose homeostasis in diet-induced pre-diabetes; however, the effects of this triterpene on liver function have not been evaluated.This study was aimed at evaluating the therapeutic effects of oleanolic  (OA) on selected markers of NAFLD in a pre-diabetes rat model.Pre-diabetes was induced by exposing Sprague Dawley rats to a high-fat high-carbohydrate diet for 20 weeks. The pre-diabetic rats were then treated with OA (80 mg/kg) or metformin (500 mg/kg) in the presence and absence of dietary interventions for a period of 12 weeks. The effects of OA were evaluated on parameters including plasma triglycerides (TGs), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, bilirubin, AST, ALT, SREBP and antioxidant profile while the livers were collected for histological analysis.The findings of this study showed that the administration of OA to pre-diabetic rats ameliorated body/liver weights ratio and significantly decreased plasma triglycerides (TGs) and VLDL. Furthermore, OA also ameliorated hepatic oxidative stress, lowered the SREBP expression and intrahepatic TGs. In addition, OA administration decreased plasma concentrations of bilirubin and liver damage enzyme biomarkers.The findings of the study suggest that OA ameliorates the risk of developing pre-diabetes-related NAFLD through the prevention of intrahepatic fat accumulation while also lowering hepatic .© 2019 Gamede et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634961>Downregulation of miR-320 Alleviates Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Inflammatory Response in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes.</a></h1><p>MicroRNAs serve important roles in the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERs). This study aimed to investigate the role of microRNA-320 (miR-320) in the development of ERs and the inflammatory response in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.The adipose tissue expression levels of miR-320 and ERs markers (GRP78, GRP94, Derlin-1 and CHOP) and the serum concentration of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, NF-κB and IL-6) in obese patients were evaluated using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The correlation of miR-320 with genes involved in ERs and  was analyzed. The effects of miR-320 on ERs and  were explored using mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which were pretreated with palmitic  (PA).ERs markers and inflammatory cytokines were all upregulated in obese patients. Adipose tissue miR-320 expression was also increased in obese patients, and had positive correlations with the levels of ERs markers and inflammatory cytokines. After PA treatment, the levels of ERs markers and inflammatory cytokines were elevated significantly in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, miR-320 expression was increased in the cells under ERs status. The upregulation of miR-320 could enhance the expression of ERs markers and inflammatory cytokines, but the downregulation of miR-320 resulted in the opposite results.The data of this study indicate that miR-320 expression is upregulated in ERs status, and the downregulation of miR-320 ameliorates ERs and the inflammatory response in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We consider that the approaches to decrease miR-320 expression may be novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of obesity and obesity-related diseases.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654098>A Novel Sandwich ELISA for Tartrate-Resistant  Phosphatase 5a and 5b Protein Reveals that Both Isoforms are Secreted by Differentiating Osteoclasts and Correlate to the Type I Collagen Degradation Marker CTX-I In Vivo and In Vitro.</a></h1><p>Tartrate-resistant  phosphatase type 5 (TRAP) exists as two isoforms, 5a and 5b. 5b is a marker of osteoclast number and 5a of chronic ; however, its association with bone resorption is unknown. In this study, a double-TRAP 5a/5b sandwich ELISA measuring 5a and 5b protein in the same sample was developed. TRAP 5a and 5b protein levels were evaluated as osteoclast differentiation/activity markers in serum and in culture, and their correlation to the resorption marker CTX-I was examined. Serum TRAP 5a and 5b concentrations in healthy men were 4.4 ± 0.6 ng/ml and 1.3 ± 0.2 ng/ml, respectively, and they correlated moderately to each other suggesting that their secretion is coupled under healthy conditions. A correlation was also observed between serum TRAP 5a and 5b with CTX-I, suggesting that both TRAP isoforms associate with osteoclast number. During osteoclast differentiation on plastic/bone, predominantly 5b increased in media/lysate from M-CSF/RANKL-stimulated CD14+ PBMCs. However, substantial levels of 5a were detected at later stages suggesting that both isoforms are secreted from differentiating OCs. More TRAP 5b was released on bone indicating a connection to osteoclast resorptive activity, and a peak in TRAP 5b/5a-ratio coincided with rapid CTX-I release. At the end of the culture period of M-CSF + RANKL-stimulated CD14+ PBMCs, there was a correlation between the secretion of TRAP 5a and 5b proteins with CTX-I. The correlation of not only 5b but also 5a with collagen degradation, both in serum and osteoclast cultures indicates that a considerable proportion of the TRAP 5a originates from osteoclasts and may reflect a hitherto undisclosed regulatory mechanism during bone resorption and bone remodeling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649546> in Renal Diseases: New and Old Players.</a></h1><p>, a process intimately linked to renal disease, can be defined as a complex network of interactions between renal parenchymal cells and resident immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, coupled with recruitment of circulating monocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils. Once stimulated, these cells activate specialized structures such as Toll-like receptor and Nod-like receptor (NLR). By detecting danger-associated molecules, these receptors can set in motion major innate immunity pathways such as nuclear factor ĸB (NF-ĸB) and NLRP3 inflammasome, causing metabolic reprogramming and phenotype changes of immune and parenchymal cells and triggering the secretion of a number of inflammatory mediators that can cause irreversible tissue damage and functional loss. Growing evidence suggests that this response can be deeply impacted by the crosstalk between the kidneys and other organs, such as the gut. Changes in the composition and/or metabolite production of the gut microbiota can influence , oxidative stress, and fibrosis, thus offering opportunities to positively manipulate the composition and/or functionality of gut microbiota and, consequentially, ameliorate deleterious consequences of renal diseases. In this review, we summarize the most recent evidence that renal  can be ameliorated by interfering with the gut microbiota through the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics. In addition to these innovative approaches, we address the recent discovery of new targets for drugs long in use in clinical practice. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, NF-ĸB inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and antimetabolic drugs can reduce renal macrophage infiltration and slow down the progression of renal disease by mechanisms independent of those usually attributed to these compounds. Allopurinol, an inhibitor of uric  production, has been shown to decrease renal  by limiting activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. So far, these protective effects have been shown in experimental studies only. Clinical studies will establish whether these novel strategies can be incorporated into the arsenal of treatments intended to prevent the progression of human disease.Copyright © 2019 Andrade-Oliveira, Foresto-Neto, Watanabe, Zatz and Câmara.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663542>Tannic -based nanogel as an efficient anti-inflammatory agent.</a></h1><p>Biologically produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important signaling molecules in the human body. Despite their importance under normal conditions, abnormal overproduction of ROS under unbalanced or irregular homeostasis can cause severe inflammatory diseases. Various antioxidants have been developed in the biomedical field to resolve high levels of ROS; however, high doses of natural antioxidants such as polyphenol can induce side effects on health. Further, synthetic antioxidants are still controversial in regards to their safety and their complicated synthesis. Inspired from our previous work, a nitric oxide-scavenging nanogel designed for treating rheumatoid arthritis, we report herein a biocompatible tannic  (TA)-based nanogel as an effective ROS scavenger. A polymeric phenylboronic -tannic  nanogel (PTNG) was prepared by simply mixing through to the formation of phenylboronic ester bonds between polymeric phenylboronate and TA. We focused on the reaction of phenylboronic ester with H2O2, which readily consumes H2O2 molecules, and applied it as an antioxidant. In addition, TA is a well-known antioxidant, specifically a free radical scavenger; thus, we expected combinatory ROS scavenging effects for PTNG. Various ROS scavenging assays revealed the significant antioxidant effects of PTNG. Under an induced  model in vitro, our PTNG showed high biocompatibility as well as strong anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, in the zymosan-induced peritonitis mouse model, a representative acute  model in vivo, PTNG reduced significant neutrophil recruitment and pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicating successful alleviation of . On the basis of these results, we suggest that PTNG has great potential as an antioxidant and should find application in the treatment of further ROS-overproducing inflammatory diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650360>PKC Mediates LPS-Induced IL-1β Expression and Participates in the Pro-inflammatory Effect of AR Under High Glutamate Concentrations in Mouse Microglia.</a></h1><p>Pathogens such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) play an important role in promoting the production of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in response to infection or damage in microglia. However, whether different signalling pathways regulate these two inflammatory factors remains unclear. The protein kinase C (PKC) family is involved in the regulation of , and our previous research showed that the activation of the PKC pathway played a key role in the LPS-induced transformation of the adenosine A receptor (AR) from anti-inflammatory activity to pro-inflammatory activity under high glutamate concentrations. Therefore, in the current study, we investigated the role of PKC in the LPS-induced production of these inflammatory cytokines in mouse primary microglia. GF109203X, a specific PKC inhibitor, inhibited the LPS-induced expression of IL-1β messenger ribonucleic  and intracellular protein in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, 5 µM GF109203X prevented LPS-induced IL-1β expression but did not significantly affect LPS-induced TNF-α expression. PKC promoted IL-1β expression by regulating the activity of NF-κB but did not significantly impact the activity of ERK1/2. AR activation by CGS21680, an AR agonist, facilitated LPS-induced IL-1β expression through the PKC pathway at high glutamate concentrations but did not significantly affect LPS-induced TNF-α expression. Taken together, these results suggest a new direction for specific intervention with LPS-induced inflammatory factors in response to specific signalling pathways and provide a mechanism for AR targeting, especially after brain injury, to influence  by interfering with AR.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667269>Data on molecular characterization and expression of the C-reactive protein (CRP) gene from rock bream, .</a></h1><p>C-reactive protein (CRP) is a member of the pentraxin family and is an acute-phase response to plasma protein; its level in blood increases rapidly in response to trauma, , and infection.

It is well known that insulin resistance, especially hepatic insulin resistance, is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Current research has shown that hepatic fatty  accumulation can cause hepatic insulin resistance through increased gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, chronic , oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired insulin signal pathway.

Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic fatty -induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged mitochondria to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial fatty  oxidation to inhibit hepatic fatty  accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and hepatic insulin resistance. Additionally, we also highlight the potential value of mitophagy in the treatment of hepatic insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 Su, Nie, Huang, Zhu, Feng, Tang and Zheng.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669442>Traditional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacology of Ficus hispida L.f.: A review.</a></h1><p>Ficus hispida L.f.

In recent years, the role of lipokines, which are lipid species predominantly secreted from adipose tissue that act as hormonal regulators in many metabolic tissues, has been an important area of research for obesity and diabetes. Previous studies have identified that these secreted lipids, including palmitoleate, 12,13-diHOME, and fatty -hydroxy-fatty  (FAHFA) species, are important regulators of metabolism. Moreover, environmental factors that directly affect the secretion of lipokines such as diet, exercise, and exposure to cold temperatures constitute attractive therapeutic strategies, but the mechanisms that regulate lipokine stimulation have not been thoroughly reviewed. In this study, we will discuss the chemical characteristics of lipokines that position them as attractive targets for chronic disease treatment and prevention and the emerging roles of lipokines as regulators of inter-tissue communication. We will define the target tissues of lipokines, and explore the ability of lipokines to prevent or delay the onset and development of chronic diseases. Comprehensive understanding of the lipokine synthesis and lipokine-driven regulation of metabolic outcomes is instrumental for developing novel preventative and therapeutic strategies that harness adipose tissue-derived lipokines.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645147>dl-Malic  as a component of α-hydroxy : effect on 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene-induced  in atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions  and .</a></h1><p> dl-Malic  (dl-M) is used widely in cosmetic formulations as a pH-adjuster or as a preservative. dl-M is used as an exfoliator in the form of α-hydroxy .

NAFLD ranges in severity from benign steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are strongly associated with NAFLD, and the western diet (WD) is a major contributor to the onset and progression of these chronic diseases. Our aim was to use a lipidomic approach to identify potential lipid mediators of diet-induced NASH. We previously used a preclinical mouse (low density lipoprotein receptor null mouse,  model to assess transcriptomic mechanisms linked to WD-induced NASH and docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6, ω3)-mediated remission of NASH. This report used livers from the previous study to carry out ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with dynamic multi-reaction monitoring (HPLC-dMRM) to assess the impact of the WD and DHA on hepatic membrane lipid and oxylipin composition, respectively.

NASH markers of  and fibrosis were inversely associated with hepatic C ω3 PUFA-derived Cyp2C- and Cyp2J-generated anti-inflammatory oxylipins (false discovery rate adjusted -value;  ≤ 0.026).

This review has examined the evidence for the presence of traditional cardiac biomarkers (nonspecific; lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, myoglobulin, glycogen phosphorylase isoenzyme BB, myosin light chains, ST2, and ischemia-modified albumin) and novel emerging cardiac-specific biomarkers (cardiac troponins, natriuretic peptides, heart-type fatty -binding protein, and miRNAs). Besides, noninvasive anatomical and electrophysiological markers (carotid intima-media thickness, coronary artery calcification, and heart rate variability) in CVDs and obesity are also discussed. Modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome in the progression of CVD, such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, oxidative stress, , and adipocytokines are also outlined. These underlying prognostic risk factors predict the onset of future microvascular and macrovascular complications. The understanding of invasive and noninvasive cardiac-specific biomarkers and the risk factors may yield valuable insights into the pathophysiology and prevention of CVD in a high-risk obese population at an early stage.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619228>Tissue-specific responses of antioxidant pathways to poor hygiene conditions in growing pigs divergently selected for feed efficiency.</a></h1><p>Poor hygiene of housing induces a systemic inflammatory response. Because  and oxidative stress are processes that can sustain each other, the ways pigs are able to activate their antioxidant defenses are critical for production performance and health during periods when the immune system is solicited. Selection for production performance can also influence reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and expression levels of genes involved in cellular response to oxidative stress in different tissues. To establish the extent by which poor hygiene and selection for feed efficiency affected redox status, pigs divergently selected for residual feed intake (RFI) were housed in poor or good hygiene during 6 weeks. At the end, blood was collected in all pigs, and half of them were killed for tissue sampling. The remaining pigs were reared in good hygiene conditions during a recovery period of 7-8 weeks.At week 6, poor hygiene was associated with a lower total antioxidant capacity assessed by plasma ferric reducing ability in all pigs, and with greater plasma levels of hydrogen peroxides in the high RFI pigs (less efficient). Adipose tissue of high RFI pigs exhibited higher activities of catalase and glutathione reductase, and greater thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) concentrations when compared with the low RFI pigs (more efficient). Poor hygiene conditions activated the antioxidant enzymes activities (glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase and catalase) in adipose tissue of both lines, but led to higher ROS production by mature adipocytes isolated from the high RFI pigs only. In liver and muscle, there were only minor changes in antioxidant molecules due to genetics and hygiene conditions. After the resilience period, adipose tissue of pigs previously challenged by poor hygiene maintained higher antioxidant enzyme activities, and for the high RFI line, displayed higher TBARS concentrations.Pigs selected for improved feed efficiency showed a lower susceptibility to oxidative stress induced by poor hygiene conditions. This could led to a lower inflammatory response and less impaired growth when these pigs are facing sanitary challenges during the production period.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654895>Protective properties of milk sphingomyelin against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and .</a></h1><p>The identification of natural bioactive compounds aimed at promoting optimal gut health and improving lipid metabolism is paramount in the prevention of chronic disease. In this review, we summarize basic science and clinical research examining the protective properties of milk sphingomyelin (SM) against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and . Dietary SM dose-dependently reduces the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, triglycerides, and fatty  in cell culture and rodent studies. Overall, rodent feeding studies show dietary milk SM, milk polar lipid mixtures, and milk fat globule membrane reduce serum and hepatic lipid concentrations. Furthermore, these hypolipidemic effects are observed in some supplementation studies in humans, although the extent of reductions in serum cholesterol is typically smaller and only one trial was conducted with purified SM. Dietary milk SM has been reported to affect the gut microbiota in rodent studies and its hydrolytic product, sphingosine, displays bactericidal activity in vitro. Milk SM may also improve gut barrier function to prevent the translocation of inflammatory gut bacteria-derived molecules. Current evidence from pre-clinical studies indicates that dietary milk SM has protective properties against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and . The hypolipidemic effects of milk SM observed in animal studies have been reported in some human studies, although the magnitude of such effects is typically smaller. More research is warranted to clearly define how dietary milk SM influences lipid metabolism, gut microbiota, and  in humans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Considering the current lack of effective treatments, we evaluated an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant nutraceutical rich in docosahexaenoic  (DHA) as a possible therapy for ACLD. We investigated the effects of two-week DHA supplementation (500 mg/kg) on hepatic fatty , PH, oxidative stress, , and hepatic stellate cell (HSC) phenotype in rats with ACLD. Additionally, the effects of DHA were evaluated in murine macrophages and human HSC. In contrast to vehicle-treated animals, cirrhotic rats receiving DHA reestablished a healthy hepatic fatty  profile, which was associated with an improvement in PH. The mechanisms underlying this hemodynamic improvement included a reduction in oxidative stress and , as well as a marked HSC deactivation, confirmed in human HSC. Experiments with cultured macrophages showed that treatment with DHA protects against pro-inflammatory insults. The present preclinical study demonstrates that a nutraceutical rich in DHA significantly improves PH in chronic liver disease mainly by suppressing  and oxidative stress-driven HSC activation, encouraging its evaluation as a new treatment for PH and cirrhosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631599>[Renal Injury and Its Mechanisms in   Mice].</a></h1><p>To study the mechanism of renal injury in   mice with the leptin receptor homozygous deficiency.Ten male of 28-week-old   mice with leptin receptor heterozygous deficiency were selected as control group and ten male   mice with leptin receptor homozygous deficiency were used in this study.

The major risk factor for liver cancer is cirrhosis with the underlying causes of cirrhosis being viral infection (hepatitis B or C), metabolic deregulation (Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the presence of obesity and diabetes), alcohol or cholestatic disorders. Lysophosphatidic  (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid with numerous effects, most of them compatible with the hallmarks of cancer (proliferation, migration, invasion, survival, evasion of apoptosis, deregulated metabolism, neoangiogenesis, etc.). Autotaxin (ATX) is the enzyme responsible for the bulk of extracellular LPA production, and together with LPA signaling is involved in chronic inflammatory diseases, fibrosis and cancer. This review discusses the most important findings and the mechanisms related to ATX/LPA/LPAR involvement on metabolic, viral and cholestatic liver disorders and their progression to liver cancer in the context of human patients and mouse models. It focuses on the role of ATX/LPA in NAFLD development and its progression to liver cancer as NAFLD has an increasing incidence which is associated with the increasing incidence of liver cancer. Bearing in mind that adipose tissue accounts for the largest amount of LPA production, many studies have implicated LPA in adipose tissue metabolism and , liver steatosis, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and lipogenesis. At the same time, LPA and ATX play crucial roles in fibrotic diseases. Given that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is usually developed on the background of liver fibrosis, therapies that both delay the progression of fibrosis and prevent its development to malignancy would be very promising. Therefore, ATX/LPA signaling appears as an attractive therapeutic target as evidenced by the fact that it is involved in both liver fibrosis progression and liver cancer development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645146>Chemical composition, antioxidant activities, in an allergic asthma model, of  L. leaf extracts from Collo (Skikda, Algeria).</a></h1><p>This study is an attempt to characterize the chemical composition and antioxidant activity of olive leaves variety (namely Bouricha variety) that is very widespread in the East of Algeria. The aqueous extract (AE) of leaves was initially analyzed for its phenolic profile. Using the liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry analysis, it was possible to identify the predominant components in the AE of the leaves. This extract was hydrolyzed with  and gave hydroxytyrosol (HT). AE and HT were evaluated for their 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging capacity, ferric reducing antioxidant power and total antioxidant activity by phosphomolybdenum method. The antioxidant and anti-asthmatic activities of these extracts were examined in a model of experimental asthma in Wistar rats. For measuring the intensity of the airway , oxidative stress parameters were analyzed in lungs and a histological study of this tissue was performed. The obtained results showed that the sensitization of the ovalbumin (OVA) group induced lung  and severe lipid peroxidation (LPO) revealed by a significant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and a decrease in the non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidant systems. However, the administration of AE and HT extracts significantly improved the antioxidant state in asthma disease and provided evidence for the relation between phenolic compounds and the high antioxidant activity of olive leaves extracts, especially HT more than AE.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630283>Beneficial effect of ER stress preconditioning in protection against FFA-induced adipocyte  via XBP1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.</a></h1><p>Adipose tissue  is closely associated with the development of obesity and insulin resistance. Free fatty  (FFAs) are a major inducer of obesity-related insulin resistance. Previously, we reported that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress potentially mediated retinal  in diabetic retinopathy. The unfolded protein response (UPR) protects cells against damage induced by oxidative stress. X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) plays a major role in protecting cells by modulating the UPR. However, the link between ER stress and adipocyte  has been poorly investigated. In the present study, we found that pretreatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with a low dose of ER stress inducer tunicamycin inhibited FFA-induced upregulated expression of inflammatory cytokines. In addition, FFAs induced phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB was largely inhibited by pretreatment with tunicamycin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Knockdown of XBP1 by siRNA markedly mitigated the protective effects of preconditioning against . Conversely, overexpression of XBP1 alleviated FFA-induced phosphorylation of IκB-α, IKKα/β, and NF-κB, which was accompanied by decreased inflammatory cytokine expression. Collectively, these results imply a beneficial role of ER stress preconditioning in protecting against FFA-induced 3T3-L1 adipocyte , which is likely mediated through inhibition of the IKK/NF-κB pathway via XBP1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634026>Effervescent Glutamine Formulation Improves the Beneficial Effects of Antiretroviral Therapies on Immune Function in HIV/AIDS Carrier Patients.</a></h1><p>The impact of oral supplementation with an effervescent glutamine formulation on the beneficial effects of antiretroviral therapies was evaluated in people living with HIV/AIDS. For this purpose, 12 HIV/AIDS carrier patients with CD4 T cell counts <500, and who had received the same antiretroviral therapy for at least 1 year before starting this investigation were selected. The patients were required to dissolve the effervescent glutamine formulation (supplied in sachets) in water immediately before oral ingestion (12.4 g), once a day, after lunch or after dinner during 30 days. CD4 T cell counts, complete blood cell counts, serum cytokines, and amino  levels were quantified; biochemical and toxicological measurements were performed. The numbers of CD4 T cells were increased ( < .05), and the serum C-reactive protein levels decreased ( < .01) after the administration of effervescent glutamine formulation. Serum levels of interferon-gamma inducible protein-10, RANTES, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 were decreased after the treatment with effervescent glutamine formulation. No changes were observed in the serum levels of amino , hematological, toxicological, and biochemical parameters. In conclusion, the treatment during 30 days with effervescent glutamine formulation was well tolerated, promoted reduction of , and improved the beneficial effects of antiretroviral therapies in HIV/AIDS carrier patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637505>Effect of Rosmarinic  and Alcohol on Fat Graft Survival in Rat Model.</a></h1><p>Autologous fat grafting is a common procedure performed for cosmetic and reconstructive purposes. Unpredictable graft survival is a major drawback, and a variety of improvements on technique such as using antioxidants have been reported to increase retention. The authors examined whether a natural rosemary plant extract known with antioxidant properties, rosmarinic , could improve the survival of the adipose tissue.Inguinal fat pads were harvested from 24 Sprague Dawley rats and implanted to the parascapular area. Rats were divided into three groups: rosmarinic  and ethanol as solvent (RA), ethanol (E), and serum physiologic (C). These substances were administered intraperitoneally daily for 1 week and once a week for 7 weeks. Volume and weight measurements, blood specimens, weight and volume records, and histopathologic examinations were performed and analyzed.The RA group demonstrated lower TOS, TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, and MDA values compared to E and C groups. TGF-beta increase was statistically insignificant, but TOS, TNF-alpha, MDA decrease was found statistically significant. Weight and volume losses were lower in the RA and E groups compared to the C group. The difference between the RA and E groups in terms of weight and volume loss was statistically insignificant. Histopathologically fat necrosis, , and fibrosis were less in the RA group compared to the E and C groups (p < 0.05).Rosmarinic  increased the fat graft volume retained and decreased cyst formation and abscess formation in the rat model. Further studies can be undertaken to investigate rosmarinic 's local application as a tumescent and safety in humans.This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each submission to which Evidence-Based Medicine rankings are applicable.

C57BL/6 type 8 week-old male mice (n = 10/per group) were fed with standard chow or three isocaloric diets consisting fructose, monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA), or saturated fatty  (SFA) for 15 weeks. After the dietary manipulation, the mice were sacrificed, tissues and blood were collected. Consequently, body weight gains, liver weights, and plasma homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values in were at higher levels in SFA and fructose groups (p < 0.05). The plasma concentrations of the non-esterified fatty  (NEFA), triglyceride (TG), and liver steatosis were found to be at higher levels in SFA and fructose groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, the expression levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (ACC1), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) in the liver were affected by the intake of SFA and fructose. Furthermore, the plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1) and the thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) in the liver were elevated in SFA and fructose group (p < 0.05). The plasma level of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL -10) was found to be lower in the SFA group compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the  and oxidation are related with the fatty - and fructose-induced impaired insulin signaling and fat accumulation in liver. Hence, in order to decrease the oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory response, it is substantial to reduce the saturated fat and added sugar or to replace with the unsaturated fat and complex carbohydrates in diet.Copyright © 2019.

Epidemiology studies demonstrated higher incidence rates in the more westernized countries. The change of habitual diets in these countries is perceived as the reason for the development of IBD. Besides, molecular biological studies showed some pathogenic substances produced after digestion of daily diet decrease the diversity of intestinal microbiota and cause dysbiosis of microbiome. Then, chronic  occurs in some genetically susceptible subjects and IBD developed. As a result, many researchers started to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of nutrients and dietary intervention on the clinical course and pathogenesis of IBD. Carbohydrates, fats, proteins and fibers are investigated and their molecular roles in the inflammatory process are discovered gradually. The undigested carbohydrates are proved to cause overgrowth of colonic bacteria and  occurs by altering colonic microbiome. ω-3 poly-unsaturated fatty  are more favored over ω-6 poly-unsaturated fatty  due to its less pro-inflammatory properties. High fibers produce more short-chain fatty  in colon and facilitate the diversity of colonic microbiota. Moreover, some dietary interventions were designed and studied with promising results. Low FODMAP is recommended in IBS and is also suggested in patients of IBD with IBS-like symptoms. Specific Carbohydrate Diet was designed for celiac disease at first and is proved to be effective to decrease  and to induce remission by decreasing non-digested carbohydrates into colon. Exclusive Enteral Nutrition has been investigated and is suggested to be the first line of management in pediatric CD in many literatures. Paleolithic diet and semi-vegetarian diet are evaluated and might be beneficial in some clinical settings. These findings are promising but limited to the evidence without high quality level. Some more well-designed studies with randomization and double-blind are needed and the primary endpoints should be more focused on the decrease of  in pathology and mucosal healing in endoscopy instead of relief of the symptoms.Copyright © 2019.

We explored the role of the innate immune complement component C5a, a potent mediator of , in the pathogenesis of DKD in clinical and experimental diabetes. Marked systemic elevation in C5a activity was demonstrated in patients with diabetes which was not therapeutically targeted by conventional renoprotective agents. C5a and its receptor (C5aR1) were upregulated early in the disease process and prior to manifest kidney injury in several diverse rodent models of diabetes. Genetic deletion of C5aR1 in mice conferred protection against diabetes-induced renal injury. Transcriptomic profiling of kidney revealed diabetes-induced downregulation of pathways involved in mitochondrial fatty  metabolism. Interrogation of the lipidomics signature revealed abnormal cardiolipin remodelling in the diabetic kidney, a cardinal sign of disrupted mitochondrial architecture and bioenergetics. In vivo delivery of an orally active inhibitor of C5aR1 (PMX53) reversed the phenotypic changes and normalized the renal mitochondrial fatty  profile, cardiolipin remodelling and citric  cycle intermediates. In vitro exposure of human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells to C5a led to altered mitochondrial respiratory function and reactive oxygen species generation. These studies provide evidence for a pivotal role of the C5a/C5aR1 axis in propagating renal injury in the development of DKD via disruption of mitochondrial agility, establishing a new immunometabolic signalling pathway in DKD.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634391>All-trans Retinoic  Counteracts Diarrhea and Inhibition of Downregulated in Adenoma Expression in Gut .</a></h1><p>Intestinal epithelial apical membrane Cl-/HCO3- exchanger DRA (downregulated in adenoma, SLC26A3) has emerged as an important therapeutic target for diarrhea, emphasizing the potential therapeutic role of agents that upregulate DRA. All-trans retinoic  (ATRA), a key vitamin A metabolite, was earlier shown by us to stimulate DRA expression in intestinal epithelial cells. However, its role in modulating DRA in gut  has not been investigated.Our aim was to analyze the efficacy of ATRA in counteracting -induced decrease in DRA in vitro and in vivo.Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-treated Caco-2 cells and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated C57BL/6J mice served as in vitro and in vivo models of gut , respectively. The effect of ATRA on IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of DRA function, expression, and promoter activity were elucidated. In the DSS colitis model, diarrheal phenotype, cytokine response, in vivo imaging, myeloperoxidase activity, and DRA expression were measured in the distal colon.All-trans retinoic  (10 μM, 24 h) abrogated IFN-γ (30 ng/mL, 24 h)-induced decrease in DRA function, expression, and promoter activity in Caco-2 cells. All-trans retinoic  altered IFN-γ signaling via blocking IFN-γ-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-1. All-trans retinoic  cotreatment (1 mg/kg BW, i.p. daily) of DSS-treated mice (3% in drinking water for 7 days) alleviated colitis-associated weight loss, diarrheal phenotype, and induction of IL-1β and CXCL1 and a decrease in DRA mRNA and protein levels in the colon.Our data showing upregulation of DRA under normal and inflammatory conditions by ATRA demonstrate a novel role of this micronutrient in alleviating IBD-associated diarrhea.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Here we show that short chain fatty  (SCFAs), such as butyrate, derived from fermentation of dietary fibers by the gut microbiota inhibit pulmonary ILC2 functions and subsequent development of airway hyperreactivity (AHR). We further show that SCFAs modulate GATA3, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolytic metabolic pathways in pulmonary ILC2s. The observed phenotype is associated with increased IL-17a secretion by lung ILC2s and linked to enhanced neutrophil recruitment to the airways. Finally, we show that butyrate-producing gut bacteria in germ-free mice effectively suppress ILC2-driven AHR. Collectively, our results demonstrate a previously unrecognized role for microbial-derived SCFAs on pulmonary ILC2s in the context of AHR.

This probe demonstrates increased tumor specificity, compared to existing tumor-specific PET probes (F-FET, C-MET, and F-FDG). Evaluation of probes by in vivo PET imaging, F-FIMP showed intense accumulation in LAT1-positive tumor tissues, but not in inflamed lesions, whereas intense accumulation of F-FDG was observed in both tumor tissues and in inflamed lesions. Metabolite analysis showed that F-FIMP was stable in liver microsomes, and mice tissues (plasma, urine, liver, pancreas, and tumor). Investigation of the protein incorporation of F-FIMP showed that it was not incorporated into protein. Furthermore, the expected mean absorbed dose of F-FIMP in humans was comparable or slightly higher than that of F-FDG and indicated that F-FIMP may be a safe PET probe for use in humans. F-FIMP may provide improved specificity for tumor diagnosis, compared to F-FDG, F-FET, and C-MET.

In this study, we compared the effects of neurite growth factor (NGF), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and M3G exposure on the expression of polySia in PC12 cells using immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis. PolySia was also extracted from stimulated cell proteins by endo-neuraminidase digestion and quantitated using fluorescent labelling followed by HPLC analysis. PolySia expression was significantly increased following NGF, M3G or LPS stimulation when compared with unstimulated cells or cells exposed to the TLR4 antagonist LPS-RS. Additionally, we analyzed the effects of test agent exposure on cell migration and the oxidative stress response of these cells in the presence and absence of polySia expression on their cell surface. We observed an increase in oxidative stress in cells without polySia as well as following M3G or LPS stimulation. Our study provides evidence that polySia expression in neuronal-like PC12 cells is influenced by M3G and LPS exposure alike, suggestive of a role of TLR4 in triggering these events.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669322>Saikosaponin A ameliorates nasal  by suppressing IL-6/ROR-γt/STAT3/IL-17/NF-κB pathway in OVA-induced allergic rhinitis.</a></h1><p>Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a type I hypersensitivity immune response and is a common chronic allergic respiratory disorder characterized by one or more nasal symptoms. Despite many studies on AR therapy, the drugs of treatment for AR remain limited in effect. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the effects of saikosaponin A (SSA) on nasal , T helper (Th)2 and Th17 cytokines, retinoic -related orphan nuclear receptor (ROR)-γt, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3, and nuclear factor (NF)-κB signalings in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced AR mice model. OVA-induced AR mice exhibited increase in nasal symptoms, histological alteration, OVA-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E/IgG1, ROR-γt, STAT3 and NF-κB signalings. However, the administration of SSA significantly decreased allergic symptoms including nasal rubbing and sneezing. Additionally, histological alterations such as mucosa layer thickness, goblet cell hyperplasia, eosinophils and mast cell infiltration in nasal tissues dramatically improved by treatment with SSA. Also, SSA treatment decreased the levels of OVA-specific IgE/IgG in serum and the levels of Th2 and Th17 cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-17 in nasal lavage fluid (NALF). Moreover, SSA inhibited the activation of transcription factor ROR-γt, STAT3 and phosphorylated STAT3 in both NALF and lung. Futher, SSA could also significantly inhibit the expressions of NF-κB p65 and phosphorylated NF-κB p65 in NALF and lung. These present results suggested that SSA may attenuate OVA-induced allergic rhinitis through regulating the expression of IL-6/ROR-γt/STAT3/IL-17/NF-κB signaling. The results indicate that SSA may be used as a therapeutic candidate for allergic rhinitis disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Other cysteinyl-containing lipid mediators derived from docosahexaenoic  (DHA), namely maresin conjugates of tissue regeneration (MCTRs), were recently discovered. Their production and actions in the lung are therefore of considerable interest.To determine MCTR production, bioactions and mechanism in human lung and in experimental allergic airway .Lipid mediator metabololipidomics profiling of lung was performed using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Donor-derived human precision cut lung slices (hPCLS) were exposed to leukotriene D (LTD), MCTRs, or both, before determination of airway contraction. The actions of exogenous MCTRs on murine allergic host responses were determined in ovalbumin and house-dust-mite induced lung .Lipidomic profiling showed that the most abundant cysteinyl lipid mediators in healthy human lung were MCTRs whereas CysLTs were most prevalent in disease. MCTRs blocked LTD-initiated airway contraction in hPCLS. In mouse allergic lung , MCTRs were present with temporally regulated production With ovalbumin-induced , MCTR1 was most potent for promoting resolution of eosinophils and MCTR3 potently decreased airway hyperreactivity to methacholine, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid albumin, and serum IgE levels. MCTR1 and MCTR3 inhibited lung eosinophilia after house dust mite-induced .These results identified lung MCTRs that when added exogenously blocked human LTD-induced airway contraction and promoted the resolution of murine allergic airway responses. Together, these findings uncover pro-resolving mechanisms for lung responses that may be disrupted in disease.Copyright © 2019.

The roles of Tβ12 (thymosin-β12) in marine invertebrates is still largely unknown, especially in terms of antibacterial immunity. In this study, we cloned the Tβ12 gene with an ORF of 126 bp coding 41 amino  from Urechis unicinctus. Tissue distribution analysis by qRT-PCR used TBP as reference gene showed that Tβ12 was widely expressed in all tissues, and the transcript levels were the highest in the body wall, followed by the coelomic fluid, and the lowest in the intestines and anal sacs. After LPS (lipopolysaccharides) injection, Tβ12 expression in the body was first elevated significantly at 3 h (p < 0.05), indicating that the body wall was the first defense line of the innate immune system; in the coelomic fluid, the Tβ12 mRNA levels increased after LPS injection, with a significant increase occurring at 6 h, showing that coelomic fluid functioned as the second defense line of the innate immune system. In the midgut and anal sacs, a significant increase in the Tβ12 level occurred at 24 h, suggesting that the midgut and anal sacs may act as accessory organs for the innate immune system. Moreover, U. unicinctus Tβ12 recombinants can effectively inhibit the growth of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. These results indicate that U. unicinctus Tβ12 plays important roles in innate antibacterial immune responses, which can deepen our understanding of Tβ12 in marine invertebrates.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Recent studies provided strong evidence that autophagy plays a key role in the etiology of Crohn's disease (CD). Probiotics may exhibit many therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory abilities. While successful results have been obtained in ulcerative colitis patients, probiotics remain inefficient in CD for unknown reason. It remains therefore important to better understand their molecular mechanisms of action.The activation of autophagy was examined by stimulating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by the bacteria, followed by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis. The impact of blocking in vitro autophagy was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using 3-methyl adenine or bafilomycin followed by cytokine secretion measurement by ELISA. The role of autophagy in the anti-inflammatory capacities of the bacterial strains was evaluated in vivo using an acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic -induced murine model of colitis. The impact of BMDC was evaluated by adoptive transfer, notably using bone marrow cells derived from autophagy-related 16-like 1-deficient mice.We showed that selected lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are able to induce autophagy activation in BMDCs. Blocking in vitro autophagy abolished the capacity of the strains to induce the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, while it exacerbated the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β. We confirmed in the TNBS-induced mouse model of colitis that autophagy is involved in the protective capacity of these selected strains, and showed that dendritic cells are involved in this process.We propose autophagy as a novel mechanism involved in the regulatory capacities of probiotics.© Copyright by the Author(s).

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) occurs when fat is deposited (steatosis) in the liver due to causes other than excessive alcohol use and is associated with liver fibrosis. In this study, we asked whether miR-29a could reduce experimental high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and liver fibrosis in mice. We performed systematical expression analyses of miR-29a transgenic mice (miR-29aTg mice) and wild-type littermates subjected to HFD-induced NAFLD. The results demonstrated that increased miR-29a not only alleviated HFD-induced body weight gain but also subcutaneous, visceral, and intestinal fat accumulation and hepatocellular steatosis in mice. Furthermore, hepatic tissue in the miR-29aTg mice displayed a weak fibrotic matrix concomitant with low fibrotic collagen1α1 expression within the affected tissues compared to the wild-type (WT) mice fed the HFD diet. Increased miR-29a signaling also resulted in the downregulation of expression of the epithelial mesenchymal transition-executing transcription factor , mesenchymal markers , and such pro- markers as  and  within the liver tissue. Meanwhile, miR-29aTg-HFD mice exhibited significantly lower levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), mitochondrial transcription factor A TFAM, and mitochondria DNA content in the liver than the WT-HFD mice. An in vitro luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that miR-29a mimic transfection reduced fatty  translocase CD36 expression in HepG2 cells. Conclusion: Our data provide new insights that miR-29a can improve HDF-induced obesity, hepatocellular steatosis, and fibrosis, as well as highlight the role of miR-29a in regulation of NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659824>Proteomics Profiling of Swine Serum Following Lipopolysaccharide Stimulation.</a></h1><p>There are no approved animal drugs for management of  in swine due to lack of validated animal models.

Two other pigs served as untreated controls. Proteins were separated by either 1D SDS-PAGE or 2D gel electrophoresis (2DE) prior to analysis by nano flow liquid chromatography (nLC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry.We identified 165 proteins using SDS-PAGE, of which 47 proteins were also detected by 2DE prior to nLC-MS/MS.

Telomere shortening has been linked to age-related diseases and noncommunicable diseases (NCD), and may reflect the effects of behavioral, psychosocial and environmental factors on health status. Telomere attrition can be affected by lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity. The search of studies included in this review was conducted on PubMed Central database. A majority of studies are cross-sectional, as there is a clear lack of prospective studies to evaluate the individual effect of dietary components, dietary patterns, and physical activity on TL in the long term. The current literature suggests that high adherence to Mediterranean diet (MD), with consumption of antioxidants, fiber and vegetables, as well as seeds and walnuts, is associated with longer TL. The dietary components of a healthy diet, such as carotenoids, vitamins A, C, D, E, polyphenols, fiber, and omega-3 fatty  could help maintain TL. In contrast, a high consumption of sugary beverages, processed meat, and proinflammatory diets is associated with telomere shortening. In a majority of studies TL is positively associated with moderate physical activity. The predominant mechanisms through which a healthy diet and moderate physical exercise could mitigate telomere attrition include decreasing oxidative stress and . We shall not discuss the associations of possible risk or protective factors in terms of causality since the majority of studies are cross-sectional and randomized controlled trials are limited; accordingly, some results are inconclusive. For future research, we suggest evaluating the individual effects of dietary components, dietary patterns and physical activity, considering repeated measurements and exercise intensity, on TL.

This study aimed to investigate BA profile alterations in Chinese nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients.BA profiles in serum and liver tissues were determined by ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry in patients from two different clinical centers.A total of 134 participants were enrolled in this study to serve as the training (n = 87) and validation (n = 47) cohorts. The ratio of circulating conjugated chenodeoxycholic  to muricholic  (P = 0.001) was elevated from healthy controls to non-NASH individuals to NASH individuals in a stepwise manner in the training cohort and was positively associated with the histological severity of NASH: steatosis (R  = 0.12), lobular  (R  = 0.12), ballooning (R  = 0.11), and fibrosis stage (R  = 0.18). The ratio was elevated in the validation cohort of NASH patients (P < 0.001), and it was able to predict NASH (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 75%) and significant fibrosis (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 71%) in these two cohorts. Moreover, this elevated ratio and impaired farnesoid X receptor signaling were found in the NASH liver.Altered BA profile in NASH is closely associated with the severity of liver lesions, and it has the potential for predicting NASH development.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632288>AIM2/IL-1α/TGF-β Axis in PBMCs From Exacerbated Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Patients Is Not Related to COX-2-Dependent Inflammatory Pathway.</a></h1><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disorder characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and progressive airflow limitation as a consequence of a chronic inflammatory response. Corticosteroids are the main treatment for COPD patients with a history of exacerbation, in that they attenuate exacerbation and dyspnea, and improve the response to bronchodilators. Nevertheless, despite corticosteroid administration, COPD patients still undergo exacerbation phases. In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the activity of Absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome-dependent pathways under corticosteroid treatment during COPD exacerbation. Stable and exacerbated COPD-derived Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were treated with a well-known anti-inflammatory agent, Dexamethasone (DEX), in the presence or not of Poly (deoxyadenylic-deoxythymidylate)  (Poly dA:dT), an AIM2 ligand. We found that IL-1α was highly increased when AIM2 was activated from Poly dA:dT in exacerbated, but not in stable, COPD-derived PBMCs. To note, the release of IL-1α after the stimulation of AIM2 in PBMCs obtained from stable (hospitalized) COPD patients was not higher from the basal conditions, though it was still as high as that observed for Poly dA:dT-stimulated PBMCs obtained from exacerbated patients. This effect was associated with a higher expression of AIM2 in pair-matched circulating CD14 cells obtained from hospitalized patients who passed from the exacerbation to stable status. Because the difference between stable and exacerbated COPD patients relies on the treatment with corticosteroids, exacerbated and stable COPD-derived PBMCs were treated with DEX. Indeed, the release of IL-1α and TGF-β was not altered after DEX treatment. In conclusion, we found that the administration of DEX  on exacerbated COPD-derived PBMCs was not able to revert the detrimental inflammatory mechanism associated with AIM2 activation responsible for the release of IL-1α and the ensuing TGF-β, contributing to the severity of disease.Copyright © 2019 Molino, Terlizzi, Colarusso, Rossi, Somma, Saglia, Pinto and Sorrentino.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666183>Understanding why REDUCE-IT was positive - Mechanistic overview of eicosapentaenoic .</a></h1><p>The REDUCE-IT study found that patients at elevated risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) who were already taking statins obtained a marked benefit by taking 4 g/d of eicosapentaenoic  ethyl esters (icosapent ethyl, IPE; Vascepa) over about 5 years.

The role of this metabolic pathway in macrophage response and function is unknown. We show that the enzyme cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) is induced in macrophages infected with pathogenic bacteria through signaling involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/MTOR and the transcription factor SP1. This results in the synthesis of cystathionine, which facilitates the survival of pathogens within myeloid cells. Our data demonstrate that the expression of CTH leads to defective macrophage activation by (i) dysregulation of polyamine metabolism by depletion of -adenosylmethionine, resulting in immunosuppressive putrescine accumulation and inhibition of spermidine and spermine synthesis, and (ii) increased histone H3K9, H3K27, and H3K36 di/trimethylation, which is associated with gene expression silencing. Thus, CTH is a pivotal enzyme of the innate immune response that disrupts host defense. The induction of the reverse transsulfuration pathway by bacterial pathogens can be considered an unrecognized mechanism for immune escape. Macrophages are professional immune cells that ingest and kill microbes. In this study, we show that different pathogenic bacteria induce the expression of cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) in macrophages. This enzyme is involved in a metabolic pathway called the reverse transsulfuration pathway, which leads to the production of numerous metabolites, including cystathionine. Phagocytized bacteria use cystathionine to better survive in macrophages. In addition, the induction of CTH results in dysregulation of the metabolism of polyamines, which in turn dampens the proinflammatory response of macrophages. In conclusion, pathogenic bacteria can evade the host immune response by inducing CTH in macrophages.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662858>The gut virome in inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis: From metagenomics to novel therapeutic approaches.</a></h1><p>The association of intestinal dysbiosis with the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease has been well established.

The enzyme glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), the most important enzyme implicated in S-adenosylmethionine catabolism in the liver, is downregulated during NAFLD progression. We have studied the mechanism involved in GNMT downregulation by its repressor microRNA miR-873-5p and the metabolic pathways affected in NAFLD as well as the benefit of recovery GNMT expression.miR-873-5p and GNMT expression were evaluated in liver biopsies of NAFLD/NASH patients. Different in vitro and in vivo NAFLD murine models were used to assess miR-873-5p/GNMT involvement in fatty liver progression through targeting of the miR-873-5p as NAFLD therapy.We describe a new function of GNMT as an essential regulator of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain in the mitochondria. In NAFLD, GNMT expression is controlled by miR-873-5p in the hepatocytes, leading to disruptions in mitochondrial functionality in a preclinical murine non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model. Upregulation of miR-873-5p is shown in the liver of NAFLD/NASH patients, correlating with hepatic GNMT depletion. Importantly, NASH therapies based on anti-miR-873-5p resolve lipid accumulation,  and fibrosis by enhancing fatty  β-oxidation in the mitochondria. Therefore, miR-873-5p inhibitor emerges as a potential tool for NASH treatment.GNMT participates in the regulation of metabolic pathways and mitochondrial functionality through the regulation of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain. In NAFLD, GNMT is repressed by miR-873-5p and its targeting arises as a valuable therapeutic option for treatment.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

JEV infection in sows primarily manifests as a reproductive disease such as abortion and transient infertility while in infected boars, it can cause orchitis. Previous studies mainly focused on the pathogenesis of human encephalitis caused by JEV infection, while few concentrations have been made to unveil the potential mechanism of reproductive dysfunction in JEV-infected pigs. In this study, histopathological analysis and immunohistochemistry staining was performed on testis of JEV-infected boars, indicating that JEV could infect testicular cells and cause inflammatory changes in testis. In vitro assays reveal that primary swine testicular cells and swine testis (ST) cells are highly permissive to JEV and significant inflammatory response was shown during JEV infection. Mechanically, we found that JEV infection increases the expression of retinoic -inducible gene I (RIG-I) and activates transcription factor NF-κB. Production of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines was greatly reduced in JEV infected testicular cells after knockout of RIG-I or treatment with the NF-κB speciﬁc inhibitor. In addition, activation of NF-κB was also significantly suppressed upon RIG-I knockout.

Agonists of the Peroxisome Proliferator Activated-Receptor beta/delta (PPARβ/δ) have been studied this last decade as "exercise-mimetics", which are potential therapies for metabolic diseases. In this study, we address the question of whether PPARβ/δ agonist treatment would improve the immunometabolic changes induced by exercise in diet-induced obese female mice, having switched from a high fat diet to a normal diet. 24 mice were assigned to groups according to an 8-week exercise training program and/or an 8-week treatment with 3 mg/kg/day of GW0742, a PPARβ/δ agonist. Our results show metabolic changes of peripheral lymphoid tissues with PPARβ/δ agonist (increase in fatty  oxidation gene expression) or exercise (increase in AMPK activity) and a potentiating effect of the combination of both on the percentage of anti-inflammatory Foxp3+ T cells. Those effects are associated with a decreased visceral adipose tissue mass and skeletal muscle  (TNF-α, Il-6, Il-1β mRNA level), an increase in skeletal muscle oxidative capacities (citrate synthase activity, endurance capacity), and insulin sensitivity.

To improve its diagnosis and treatment, numerous efforts have been undertaken to identify reliable biomarkers for autism. None of them have delivered the holy grail that represents a reproducible, quantifiable, and sensitive biomarker. Though blood platelets are mainly known to prevent bleeding, they also play pivotal roles in cancer, , and neurological disorders. Platelets could serve as a peripheral biomarker or cellular model for autism as they share common biological and molecular characteristics with neurons. In particular, platelet-dense granules contain neurotransmitters such as serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric . Molecular players controlling granule formation and secretion are similarly regulated in platelets and neurons. The major platelet integrin receptor αIIbβ3 has recently been linked to ASD as a regulator of serotonin transport. Though many studies revealed associations between platelet markers and ASD, there is an important knowledge gap in linking these markers with autism and explaining the altered platelet phenotypes detected in autism patients.

Carnosic  (CA) is a phenolic diterpene compound that serves a central role in cytoprotective responses to . In the present study, the protective mechanism of CA on acute lung injury (ALI) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was investigated. Mice were randomly assigned to the following five groups: Control group, LPS group, and LPS plus CA groups (at 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg doses). Following pre-treatment with vehicle or CA, ALI was induced by the administration of LPS. At 6 h after LPS treatment, mice were sacrificed and lung tissues were harvested for histologic analysis and the determination of wet-to-dry ratio, myeloperoxidase activity and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and NF-κB expression.

However, conventional treatments have been effective in inducing remission of IBD but not in preventing the relapse of them.

Even so, literature is conflicted regarding the location and persistence of MSC in the body after transplantation. For this reason, recent studies have focused on the paracrine effect of the biofactors secreted by MSC, especially in relation to the immunomodulatory potential of soluble factors (cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors) and extracellular vehicles that are involved in cell communication and in the transfer of cellular material, such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic .

Although a large number of irreversible-acting MAGL inhibitors have been discovered over the past years, there are only few compounds known so far which inhibit the enzyme in a reversible manner. Therefore, much effort is put into the development of novel chemical entities showing reversible inhibitory behavior, which is thought to cause less undesired side effects. To explore a wide range of chemical structures as MAGL binders, we have applied a virtual screening approach by docking small molecules into the crystal structure of human MAGL (hMAGL) and envisaged a library of 45 selected compounds which were then synthesized. Biochemical investigations included the determination of the inhibitory potency on hMAGL and two related hydrolases, i.e. human fatty  amide hydrolase (hFAAH) and murine cholesterol esterase (mCEase). The most promising candidates from theses analyses, i.e. three ω-quinazolinonylalkyl aryl ureas bearing alkyl spacers of three to five methylene groups, exhibited IC values of 20-41 µM and reversible, detergent-insensitive behavior towards hMAGL. Among these compounds, the inhibitor 1-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-3-(4-(4-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-2-yl)butyl)urea (96) was selected for further kinetic characterization, yielding a dissociation constant K = 15.4 µM and a mixed-type inhibition with a pronounced competitive component (α = 8.94). This mode of inhibition was further supported by a docking experiment, which suggested that the inhibitor occupies the substrate binding pocket of hMAGL.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The animals were exposed to Cd (5 mg/kg) and Ni (150 μg/L in drinking water) singly or co-exposed to both metals and ω-3FA at 20 mg/kg for 14 consecutive days. Results showed that hepatorenal injury resulting from individual exposure to Cd or Ni was not aggravated in the co-exposure group. Moreover, ω-3FA markedly abrogated the reduction in the antioxidant enzyme activities, the increase in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and lipid peroxidation induced by Cd and Ni co-exposure. Additionally, ω-3FA administration markedly suppressed the increase in hepatic and renal myeloperoxidase activity, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-1 β levels in the co-exposure group. Genotoxicity resulting from individual exposure to Cd or Ni was intensified in the co-exposure group. However, ω-3FA administration markedly ameliorated the genotoxicity and histological lesions in the co-exposure group. Taken together, co-exposure to Cd and Ni aggravated genotoxicity and not oxido-inflammatory stress in the liver and kidney of rats. ω-3FA abated hepatorenal injury and genotoxicity induced by Cd and Ni co-exposure in rats.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673770>Mice expressing the variant rs1143679 allele of ITGAM (CD11b) show impaired DC-mediated T cell proliferation.</a></h1><p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and functional genomic analyses have implicated several ITGAM (CD11b) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the development of SLE and other disorders. ITGAM encodes the α chain of the β integrin Mac-1, a receptor that plays important roles in myeloid cell functions. The ITGAM SNP rs1143679, which results in an arginine to histidine change at amino  position 77 of the CD11b protein, has been shown to reduce binding to several ligands and to alter Mac-1-mediated cellular response in vitro. Importantly, however, the potential contribution of this SNP variant to the initiation and/or progression of immune and inflammatory processes in vivo remains unexplored. Herein, we describe for the first time the generation and characterization of a mouse line expressing the 77His variant of CD11b. Surprisingly, we found that 77His did not significantly affect Mac-1-mediated leukocyte migration and activation as assessed using thioglycollate-induced peritonitis and LPS/TNF-α-induced dermal  models. In contrast, expression of this variant did alter T cell immunity, as evidenced by significantly reduced proliferation of ovalbumin (OVA)-specific transgenic T cells in 77His mice immunized with OVA. Reduced antigen-specific T cell proliferation was also observed when either 77His splenic dendritic cells (DCs) or bone marrow-derived DCs were used as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Although more work is necessary to determine how this alteration might influence the development of SLE or other diseases, these in vivo findings suggest that the 77His variant of CD11b can compromise the ability of DCs to induce antigen-driven T cell proliferation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623621>The effectiveness of marine based fatty  compound (PCSO-524) and firocoxib in the treatment of canine osteoarthritis.</a></h1><p>NSAIDs are accepted as the most predictably efficacious medical treatment of the clinical signs of osteoarthritis (OA). The marine-based fatty- compound PCSO-524 has been proposed as an adjunctive treatment for canine OA, however benefits of this agent is still controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of PCSO-524 combined with the NSAID firocoxib using force plate gait analysis, orthopedic assessment score (OAS) and canine brief pain inventory score (CBPI) in dogs with OA. A prospective, randomized, double-blinded study was conducted. Seventy-nine dogs that had hip and/or stifle OA were assigned randomly into three treatment groups: firocoxib, PCSO-524 and combination of firocoxib and PCSO-524, orally for 4 weeks. Peak vertical force (PVF, expressed as a percentage of bodyweight), OAS, CBPI, serum prostaglandin E concentration, hematology and blood chemistry values were evaluated before treatment (Day0), as well as at the second (Day14) and fourth week (Day28) during treatment.Within group analysis revealed significant increases in PVF over the 4-week treatment period for firocoxib, PCSO-524 and the combination (p < 0.05). Mean increases in PVF were 3.25 ± 4.13, 2.01 ± 3.86, 4.11 ± 4.69%BW (mean ± SD) respectively. The OAS showed non-significant change in all treatment groups. There were significant decreases in CBPI pain severity score (PSS) and CBPI pain interference scores (PIS) within some groups over time, however no significant differences were found between the groups. Significantly decreased serum PGE concentration (p < 0.05) was found in the combination group. Significant increases in BUN and creatinine (p < 0.05) compared to pre-treatment values were found in the firocoxib and combination groups but not in the PCSO-524 group at day28, but all values in all dogs remained within the normal ranges.The results of this study suggested combination of both PCSO-524 and firocoxib is more effective in alleviation of  and improvement of weight bearing ability when compared to the uses of either PCSO-524 or firocoxib alone. Further clinical studies are needed to confirm this, and to determine if there is any benefit of PCSO-524 over placebo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626956>Knockdown of DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX5 selectively attenuates serine 311 phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 subunit and expression level of anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2.</a></h1><p>NF-κB plays a key role in the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in immunity, , cell proliferation, and oncogenesis. The NF-κB activation process includes nuclear translocation, followed by association with basal transcription machinery. These steps are tightly regulated by posttranslational modification of the proteins involved in this pathway. We recently reported that NF-κB transactivation activity is enhanced by knockdown of diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGKζ), which belongs to an enzyme family that phosphorylates lipidic second messenger diacylglycerol to phosphatidic . To investigate details of the regulatory mechanism exerted by DGKζ, we identified DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX5 as a novel DGKζ-interacting protein and examined functional role of DDX5 in NF-κB transactivation activity. Here we show that DDX5 knockdown exerts no significant effect on nuclear translocation, but specifically attenuates Ser311 phosphorylation of p65 subunit. Luciferase reporter assay reveals that the NF-κB transcriptional activity is repressed in DDX5-knockdown cells. Furthermore, we found that DDX5 knockdown selectively downregulates the expression level of Bcl-2 of the NF-κB-inducible anti-apoptotic factors upon TNF-α stimulation. Considering the evidence collectively, we can infer that DGKζ-interacting multi-protein complex modulates the NF-κB transactivation activity in a negative and positive manner under conditions in which the expression level of a component of the complex is altered.Copyright © 2019.

Age-related cognitive impairment is associated with selective neuronal loss, oxidative changes that lead to microglia activation and neuroinflammation. In addition, it is associated to alteration reduction in trophic factors affecting neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. In recent years, attention has been paid to the relationship between gut microbiota and brain. In aging, there is an alteration in microbiota, gut microbiota diversity is perturbed with an increase in pathogenic bacteria at the expense of beneficial ones. Dysbiosis may lead to chronic , and a decrease in bacteria metabolites such as short-chain fatty  which have been related to an upregulation of neurotrophic factors. Supplementation with prebiotics and probiotics can modulate gut microbiota, returning it to a more physiological state; thus, they may be considered as a possible treatment for age-related cognitive impairment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To meet this need, hyaluronic  (HA)/ibuprofen (IBU) (HAI) NFMs were prepared by electrospinning, followed by dual ionic crosslinking with FeCl (HAIF NFMs) and covalent crosslinking with 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE) to produce HAIFB NFMs. It is expected that the multi-functional NFMs will act as a physical barrier to prevent fibroblast penetration, HA will reduce fibroblast attachment and impart a lubrication effect for tendon gliding, while IBU will function as an anti- drug. For this purpose, we successfully fabricated HAIFB NFMs containing 20% (HAI20FB), 30% (HAI30FB), and 40% (HAI40FB) IBU and characterized their physico-chemical properties by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, and mechanical testing. In vitro cell culture studies revealed that all NFMs except HAI40FB possessed excellent effects in preventing fibroblast attachment and penetration while preserving high biocompatibility without influencing cell proliferation. Although showing significant improvement in mechanical properties over other NFMs, the HAI40FB NFM exhibited cytotoxicity towards fibroblasts due to the higher percentage and concentration of IBU released form the membrane. In vivo studies in a rabbit flexor tendon rupture model demonstrated the efficacy of IBU-loaded NFMs (HAI30FB) over Seprafilm and NFMs without IBU (HAFB) in reducing local  and preventing tendon adhesion based on gross observation, histological analyses, and biomechanical functional assays. We concluded that an HAI30FB NFM will act as a multi-functional barrier membrane to prevent peritendinous adhesion after tendon surgery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638214>Effects of β‑hydroxybutyric  and ghrelin on the motility and  of gastric antral smooth muscle cells involving the regulation of growth hormone secretagogue receptor.</a></h1><p>Ghrelin is an orexigenic hormone that is produced by gastric cells. Ghrelin stimulates food intake and increases gastric movement. In rat model, injected β‑hydroxybutyric  (β‑HB) leads to a decrease in body weight. It has been reported that patients with gastric erosions are slower to evacuate the stomach. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of ghrelin and β‑HB on motility and  in rat gastric antral smooth muscle cells (GASMCs). GASMCs were extracted from rat gastric antrum. Cell viability was determined using the Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay. A reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay kit was used to analyze the levels of ROS using flow cytometry. Protein levels were determined using western blotting, and the expression levels of mRNAs were evaluated using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. β‑HB inhibited the expression of myosin regulatory light polypeptide 9 (MYL9), myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), transforming protein RhoA (RhoA), Rho‑associated protein kinase‑1 (ROCK‑1) and growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS‑R). By contrast, ghrelin increased the expression of MYL9, MLCK, RhoA, ROCK‑1 and GHS‑R in β‑HB‑treated GASMCs. β‑HB increased the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α, interleukin (IL)‑6 and ROS, and decreased the levels of manganese (Mn) superoxide dismutase (SOD), copper/zinc (Cu/Zn)SOD and catalase. Ghrelin decreased the expression of TNF‑α, IL‑6, ROS and catalase, whereas ghrelin promoted the expression of MnSOD and Cu/ZnSOD in β‑HB‑treated GASMCs. Short interfering RNA targeting GHS‑R inhibited the expression of MYL9, MLCK, RhoA and ROCK‑1, and increased the levels of TNF‑α, IL‑6 and ROS in β‑HB‑treated or ghrelin‑treated GASMCs. The present study provided preliminary evidence that β‑HB inhibits the motility of GASMCs and promotes  in GASMCs, whereas ghrelin decreases these effects. GHS‑R acted as a primary regulator of motility and  in GASMCs treated with β‑HB and ghrelin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618926>Where to Stand with Stromal Cells and Chronic Synovitis in Rheumatoid Arthritis?</a></h1><p>The synovium exercises its main function in joint homeostasis through the secretion of factors (such as lubricin and hyaluronic ) that are critical for the joint lubrication and function. The main synovium cell components are fibroblast-like synoviocytes, mesenchymal stromal/stem cells and macrophage-like synovial cells. In the synovium, cells of mesenchymal origin modulate local  and fibrosis, and interact with different fibroblast subtypes and with resident macrophages. In pathologic conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, fibroblast-like synoviocytes proliferate abnormally, recruit mesenchymal stem cells from subchondral bone marrow, and influence immune cell activity through epigenetic and metabolic adaptations. The resulting synovial hyperplasia leads to secondary cartilage destruction, joint swelling, and pain. In the present review, we summarize recent findings on the molecular signature and the roles of stromal cells during synovial pannus formation and rheumatoid arthritis progression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643088>MicroRNAs facilitate skeletal muscle maintenance and metabolic suppression in hibernating brown bears.</a></h1><p>Hibernating brown bears, Ursus arctos, undergo extended periods of inactivity and yet these large hibernators are resilient to muscle disuse atrophy. Physiological characteristics associated with atrophy resistance in bear muscle have been examined (e.g., muscle mechanics, neural activity) but roles for molecular signaling/regulatory mechanisms in the resistance to muscle wasting in bears still require investigation. Using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR), the present study characterized the responses of 36 microRNAs linked with development, metabolism, and regeneration of skeletal muscle, in the vastus lateralis of brown bears comparing winter hibernating and summer active animals. Relative levels of mRNA of selected genes (mef2a, pax7, id2, prkaa1, and mstn) implicated upstream and downstream of the microRNAs were examined. Results indicated that hibernation elicited a myogenic microRNA, or "myomiR", response via MEF2A-mediated signaling. Upregulation of MEF2A-controlled miR-1 and miR-206 and respective downregulation of pax7 and id2 mRNA are suggestive of responses that promote skeletal muscle maintenance. Increased levels of metabolic microRNAs, such as miR-27, miR-29, and miR-33, may facilitate metabolic suppression during hibernation via mechanisms that decrease glucose uptake and fatty  oxidation. This study identified myomiR-mediated mechanisms for the promotion of muscle regeneration, suppression of ubiquitin ligases, and resistance to muscle atrophy during hibernation mediated by observed increases in miR-206, miR-221, miR-31, miR-23a, and miR-29b. This was further supported by the downregulation of myomiRs associated with a muscle injury and  (miR-199a and miR-223) during hibernation. The present study provides evidence of myomiR-mediated signaling pathways that are activated during hibernation to maintain skeletal muscle functionality in brown bears.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614852>Grape Seeds Proanthocyanidins: An Overview of In Vivo Bioactivity in Animal Models.</a></h1><p>Over the last decade, proanthocyanidins (PACs) are attracting attention not only from the food industry but also from public health organizations due to their health benefits. It is well-known that grapes are a good source of PACs and for that reason, the industry is also focused on grape by-products identification and bioactivity evaluation. Grape seeds extract (GSPE) is a rich source of PACs, mainly composed of monomeric catechin and epicatechin, gallic  and polymeric and oligomeric proanthocyanidins. Thus, this review encompasses the state-of-art structure and the most recent evidence about the impact of GSPE on chronic diseases, with a focus on oxidative stress,  and metabolic syndrome (MeS)-related disorders such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular risk disease in vivo to offer new perspectives in the field that allow further research. Despite the controversial results, is undeniable that PACs from grape seeds are highly antioxidants, thus, the capacity of GSPE to improve oxidative stress might mediate the  process and the progress of MeS-related pathologies. However, further well-design animal studies with standardized dosages and GSPE composition are necessary to shed light into the cause-effect relationship in a more accurate way to later allow a deeper study of the effect of GSPE in humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615033>Oxidative Stress and  in Sows with Excess Backfat: Up-Regulated Cytokine Expression and Elevated Oxidative Stress Biomarkers in Placenta.</a></h1><p>In sows, excess backfat during late gestation is associated with increased farrowing difficulties and influences the fetus, but the impact of backfat thickness on placental , oxidative stress, and vascular development has not been defined. In this study, 120 sows were divided into six groups based on backfat thickness (≤16, 17-18, 19-20, 21-22, 23-24, and ≥25 mm) in late gestation. The placental lipids, reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels, inflammatory-related cytokine and angiogenesis were determined. The concentrations of triglycerides, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and free fatty  (FFA) linearly increased ( < 0.05) associated with increased late gestation backfat. ROS and MDA increased and TAC decreased ( < 0.05) as the backfat thickness increased. The mRNA expression of toll-like receptors (TLR) 2, TLR4, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 increased with increased backfat in late gestation. There were no differences in IL-8 and IL-10 mRNA expression among sows with different backfat thickness. Placental vessel density initially increased and then decreased with increasing backfat thickness of sows. Similarly, the mRNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were also increased and then decreased. Excessive backfat in late gestation was associated with greater oxidative stress, greater expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and decreased expression of placental angiogenic regulators.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622116>-Butyrylated hyaluronic  ameliorates gout and hyperuricemia in animal models.</a></h1><p> Hyaluronic  (HA) plays critical roles in the structural skeleton, joint lubrication, renal function and cell signaling. We previously showed that partially -butyrylated, low molecular weight, hyaluronic  (BHA) exhibited an anti-inflammatory effect in cultured human macrophage, where  was induced either by a TL-4 agonist or the low molecular weight HA itself, in dose-dependent fashion.  To investigate the anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and antihyperuricemic effects of BHA using animal models of acute gouty arthritis and hyperuricemia.  The anti-inflammatory effect of articular BHA (10 and 50 μg) injections was evaluated by measuring joint swelling and the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines in a model of acute gouty arthritis induced by intra-articular injection of monosodium urate crystals in Wistar rats ( = 10/group), in comparison to the control group with saline injection. Antioxidative and antihyperuricemic activities were investigated using intraperitoneal injections of oteracil potassium and yeast extract hyperuricemic Balb/C mice, which were treated with intraperitoneal injection of BHA at day 6-8 in the model.  In the gouty arthritis rat model, BHA at a higher dosage (50 μg) demonstrated a strong anti-inflammatory effect by reducing the degree of articular swelling and the serum levels of IL-1β, IL-8, IFN-γ, and MCP-1 by 5.56%, 6.55%, 15.58% and 33.18%. In the hyperuricemic mouse model, lower dosage BHA (10 μg) was sufficient to provide antioxidative activities by significantly decreasing the ROS levels in both serum and liver by 14.87% and 8.04%, while improving liver SOD by 12.77%. Intraperitoneal injection of BHA suppressed uric  production through reducing liver XO activity by 19.78% and decreased the serum uric  level in hyperuricemic mice by 30.41%. : This study demonstrated for the first time that BHA exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidative and antihyperuricemic effects , suggesting a potential therapeutic application of BHA in gouty arthritis and hyperuricemia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644052>Hematologic Growth Factors.</a></h1><p>The hematologic growth factors (also called stimulating factors) are polypeptides that interact with cell surface receptors on hematologic progenitor cells causing their activation, proliferation and differentiation into mature circulating cells such as red blood cells, white blood cells, neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages and platelets. Several recombinant hematologic growth factors or agonists for their receptors have been produced that are useful in treating anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, particularly in patients with end stage renal disease or aplastic anemia or who have received cancer chemotherapy or a hematopoietic cell transplant. Most of the hematologic growth factors are recombinant polypeptides and have not been implicated in causing serum aminotransferase elevations or clinically apparent liver injury. A small molecule agonist of the thrombopoietin receptor (eltrombopag), however, has been linked to serum enzyme elevations during therapy, although not specifically to clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice.  include epoetin (e poe’ e tin), which is a recombinant form of erythropoietin, the 165 amino  glycoprotein that induces red blood cell production from progenitors in the bone marrow. Erythropoietin is made in the kidneys and acts on progenitor erythroblasts through the erythropoietin receptor to cause proliferation and maturation into red cells. The major stimulus to erythropoietin synthesis is tissue hypoxia, but other factors modulate the response. Deficiency of erythropoietin is common in end stage renal disease and may also be present in premature infants and in patients with malignancies, chronic  and cancer chemotherapy. Recombinant epoetin became available in the 1980’s and was shown to raise hemoglobin and hematocrit levels in patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, as well as in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy and patients with AIDS on drugs that cause anemia. Epoetin alfa was approved for use to treat anemia in patients with renal disease and receiving cancer chemotherapy in 1989 and is now widely used. Indications have broadened to include reduction of allogeneic red cell transfusion in patients undergoing elective surgery and it is used off-label for other forms of anemia associated with relative erythropoietin deficiency. Longer acting formulations are also available including darbepoetin and peginesatide.  increase white blood counts including neutrophils and macrophages/monocytes, and include granulocyte stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Human G-CSF is a 175 amino  protein that induces the proliferation and maturation of neutrophils and is produced by multiple cell types including monocytes, fibroblasts, macrophages and stromal cells. It acts on specific receptors found on neutrophil progenitors. Human G-CSF is a 127 amino  glycoprotein that acts upon both progenitors of both neutrophils and macrophages or monocytes. Recombinant forms of G-CSF (filgrastim and pegfilgrastim) and GM-CSF (sargramostim) have been developed and are approved for use in patients with malignancies after chemotherapy induced neutropenia and to support patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation.  is a 332 amino  protein that acts on its receptors on megakaryocytes to stimulate their proliferation and differentiation resulting in increases in circulating platelet counts. Recombinant forms of human thrombopoietin were found to be effective in raising platelet counts, but resulted in induction of neutralizing antibody in a proportion of patients which led to severe thrombocytopenia. For this reason, further development of recombinant thrombopoietin as a therapeutic agent was abandoned. Subsequently, a small molecule agonist of the thrombopoietin receptor was identified (eltrombopag) and shown to be effective in raising platelet counts in patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), as well as in patients with aplastic anemia and patients with cirrhosis undergoing interferon-based therapy. In addition, a recombinant molecule of 4 copies of a small peptide that binds the thrombopoietin receptor fused to a copy of the human IgG1 heavy chain (romiplostim) was developed that has agonist activity to the receptor, despite lack of homology to thrombopoietin. Administration of romiplostim causes maturation of megakaryocytes and increased synthesis and release of platelets without inducing neutralizing antibody.

Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) is an end product in the human liver; however, mouse Cyp2c70 metabolizes CDCA to hydrophilic muricholic  (MCAs). Moreover, in humans the gut microbiota converts the primary BAs cholic  and CDCA into deoxycholic  (DCA) and lithocholic  (LCA), respectively. In contrast, the mouse Cyp2a12 reverts this action and converts these secondary BAs to primary BAs. Here we generated Cyp2a12 KO, Cyp2c70 KO and Cyp2a12/Cyp2c70 double knockout (DKO) mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to study the regulations of BA metabolism under hydrophobic BA composition. Cyp2a12 KO mice showed the accumulation of DCAs, whereas Cyp2c70 KO mice lacked MCAs and exhibited markedly increased hepatobiliary proportions of CDCA. In DKO mice, not only DCAs or CDCAs but DCAs, CDCAs and LCAs were all elevated. In Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, chronic liver  was observed depending on the hepatic unconjugated CDCA concentrations. The BA pool was markedly reduced in Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, but the farnesoid X receptor was not activated. It was suggested that the cytokine/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway and the pregnane X receptor-mediated pathway are the predominant mechanisms, preferred over the FXR/SHP and FXR/FGF15 pathways, for controlling BA synthesis under hydrophobic BA composition. From our results, we hypothesize that these KO mice can be novel and useful models for investigating the roles of hydrophobic BAs in various human diseases.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665659>Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), the critical intermediate of -induced fetal membrane weakening, primarily exerts its weakening effect on the choriodecidua rather than the amnion.</a></h1><p>We have previously demonstrated two associations of PPROM, (1) /infection (modeled by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)) and (2) decidual bleeding (modeled by thrombin), both decrease fetal membrane (FM) rupture strength in-vitro. Furthermore, Granulocyte-Macrophage-Colony-Stimulating-Factor (GM-CSF) induced by both TNF and thrombin is a critical intermediate, necessary and sufficient for weakening by either agent. The amnion is the strength component of FM and must weaken for FM to rupture. It is unclear whether GM-CSF weakens amnion (AM) directly, or initially targets choriodecidua (CD) which secondarily releases agents to act on amnion.Full thickness FM fragments were treated with/without GM-CSF. Some were preincubated with alpha-lipoic  (LA), a known inhibitor of FM weakening. The FM fragments were then strength-tested. Separately, FM fragments were initially separated to AM and CD. AM fragments were cultured with Medium ± GM-CSF and then strength-tested. In other experiments, CD fragments were cultured with Medium, GM-CSF, LA, or LA + GM-CSF. Conditioned medium from each group was then incubated with AM. AM was then strength-tested. Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) and Tissue Inhibitors of Matrix Metalloproteinases (TIMPs) were analyzed by Mutiplex Elisa.GM-CSF weakened intact FM which was blocked by LA. GM-CSF did not weaken isolated AM. However, GM-CSF conditioned CD media weakened AM and this weakening was inhibited by LA. GM-CSF treatment of CD increased MMPs 2, 9, and 10, and decreased TIMPs 1-3. LA reversed these effects.GM-CSF does not weaken amnion directly; GM-CSF acts on CD to increase proteases and decrease anti-proteases which secondarily weaken the amnion.Copyright © 2019.

The multifunctional coating was designed to have three fundamental properties: adhesion to device, close mechanical resemblance to human soft tissues, and control of the inflammatory response and tissue repair process. This aim was fulfilled by preparing a multilayered coating based on three components: a hydrophilic primer to allow device adhesion, a poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel layer to provide good mechanical compliance with the human tissue, and a layer of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) fibers. The use of biopolymer fibers offered the potential for a long-term interface able to modulate the release of an anti-inflammatory drug (dexamethasone), thus contrasting acute and chronic  response following device implantation. Two copolymers, poly(vinyl acetate-acrylic ) and poly(vinyl alcohol-acrylic ), were synthetized and characterized using thermal analysis (DSC, TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR chemical imaging), in vitro cell viability, and an adhesion test. The resulting hydrogels were biocompatible, biostable, mechanically compatible with soft tissues, and able to incorporate and release the drug.

In addition to total FFA quantity, the quality of FFAs (saturation and chain length) is a key determinant of lipotoxicity. We discuss in vitro and in vivo experimental models to investigate lipo- and glucolipotoxicity in β-cells and describe experimental pitfalls. Lipo- and glucolipotoxicity adversely affect many steps of the insulin production and secretion process. The molecular mechanisms underpinning lipo- and glucolipotoxic β-cell dysfunction and death comprise endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired autophagy and . Crosstalk between these stress pathways exists at multiple levels and may aggravate β-cell lipo- and glucolipotoxicity. Lipo- and glucolipotoxicity are therapeutic targets as several drugs impact the underlying stress responses in β-cells, potentially contributing to their glucose-lowering effects in type 2 diabetes.Crown Copyright © 2019.

However, the awareness of the long-term nutritional intake of ω-3 PUFAs in lowering the risk of a variety of chronic human diseases has grown exponentially only since the 1980s (1, 2). Despite the overwhelming epidemiological evidence, many attempts of using fish-oil supplementation to intervene human diseases have generated conflicting and often ambiguous outcomes; null or weak supporting conclusions were sometimes derived in the subsequent META analysis. Different dosages, as well as the sources of fish-oil, may have contributed to the conflicting outcomes of intervention carried out at different clinics. However, over the past decade, mounting evidence generated from genetic mouse models and clinical studies has shed new light on the functions and the underlying mechanisms of ω-3 PUFAs and their metabolites in the prevention and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes. In this review, we have summarized the current understanding of the effects as well as the underlying mechanisms of ω-3 PUFAs on autoimmune diseases.Copyright © 2019 Li, Bi, Wang, Zhang, Li and Zhao.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637718>Developments in the study of gastrointestinal microbiome disorders affected by FGF19 in the occurrence and development of colorectal neoplasms.</a></h1><p>Colorectal neoplasms are a type of malignant digestive system tumor that has become the third-highest morbidity tumor in China and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide.

Seeking the initiating events, we tested the hypothesis that the intestine could be damaged by repeated lipid supply and therefore participate in . In mice, 1-5 palm oil gavages increased intestinal permeability via decreased expression and mislocalization of junctional proteins at the cell-cell contacts; altered the intestinal bacterial species by decreasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, segmented filamentous bacteria, and Clostridium leptum; and increased inflammatory cytokine expression. This was further studied in human intestinal epithelial Caco-2/TC7 cells using the two main components of palm oil, i.e., palmitic and oleic . Saturated palmitic  impaired paracellular permeability and junctional protein localization, and induced inflammatory cytokine expression in the cells, but unsaturated oleic  did not. Inhibiting de novo ceramide synthesis prevented part of these effects. Altogether, our data show that short exposure to palm oil or palmitic  induces intestinal dysfunctions targeting barrier integrity and . Excessive palm oil consumption could be an early player in the gut alterations observed in metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019.

For this purpose, we established a NAFLD model by feeding C57BL/6J mice a methionine‑choline‑​deficient diet. Antagomir‑21 was then injected via the tail vein, and the expression levels of WNT/β‑catenin signaling pathway‑related proteins, such as LRP6, glycogen synthase kinase‑3β (GSK3β), p‑β‑catenin, β‑catenin and the downstream protein, peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor γ (PPAR‑γ), and lipid metabolism‑related genes, including sterol regulatory element‑binding transcription factor 1c (SREBP1c), fatty  synthase (FAS), carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1α (CPT1α) and adenosine 5‑monophosphate (AMP)‑activated protein kinase α (AMPKα), were detected. The results revealed that in the NAFLD model, LRP6 expression was negatively associated with miR‑21 expression. After antagonizing the expression of miR‑21, the protein level of LRP6 was increased. In addition, the WNT/β‑catenin signaling pathway was activated, and lipid accumulation and  were alleviated in the liver. However, the expression of PPAR‑γ was not inhibited following the upregulation of the WNT signaling pathway. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that the inhibition of miR‑21 expression can alleviate NAFLD by targeting LRP6 to activate the WNT/β‑catenin signaling pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636638>Heparanase-Dependent Remodeling of Initial Lymphatic Glycocalyx Regulates Tissue-Fluid Drainage During Acute  .</a></h1><p>The glycocalyx is a dense layer of carbohydrate chains involved in numerous and fundamental biological processes, such as cellular and tissue homeostasis,  and disease development. Composed of membrane-bound glycoproteins, sulfated proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycan side-chains, this structure is particularly essential for blood vascular barrier functions and leukocyte diapedesis. Interestingly, whilst the glycocalyx of blood vascular endothelium has been extensively studied, little is known about the composition and function of this glycan layer present on tissue-associated lymphatic vessels (LVs). Here, we applied confocal microscopy to characterize the composition of endothelial glycocalyx of initial lymphatic capillaries in murine cremaster muscles during homeostatic and inflamed conditions using an anti-heparan sulfate (HS) antibody and a panel of lectins recognizing different glycan moieties of the glycocalyx. Our data show the presence of HS, α-D-galactosyl moieties, α2,3-linked sialic  and, to a lesser extent, N-Acetylglucosamine moieties. A similar expression profile was also observed for LVs of mouse and human skins. Interestingly,  of mouse cremaster tissues or ear skin as induced by TNF-stimulation induced a rapid (within 16 h) remodeling of the LV glycocalyx, as observed by reduced expression of HS and galactosyl moieties, whilst levels of α2,3-linked sialic  remains unchanged. Furthermore, whilst this response was associated with neutrophil recruitment from the blood circulation and their migration into tissue-associated LVs, specific neutrophil depletion did not impact LV glycocalyx remodeling. Mechanistically, treatment with a non-anticoagulant heparanase inhibitor suppressed LV HS degradation without impacting neutrophil migration into LVs. Interestingly however, inhibition of glycocalyx degradation reduced the capacity of initial LVs to drain interstitial fluid during acute . Collectively, our data suggest that rapid remodeling of endothelial glycocalyx of tissue-associated LVs supports drainage of fluid and macromolecules but has no role in regulating neutrophil trafficking out of inflamed tissues via initial LVs.Copyright © 2019 Arokiasamy, King, Boulaghrasse, Poston, Nourshargh, Wang and Voisin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661774>Eleutheroside B Protects against Acute Kidney Injury by Activating IGF Pathway.</a></h1><p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common, complex, and severe clinical syndrome characterized by rapid decline in renal function, combined with tissue damage. Currently, the prevention and treatment of AKI are focused on symptomatic treatment, rather than treating the underlying causes. Therefore, there is no specific treatment to prevent renal injury except for renal dialysis. In this study, we used cisplatin-induced AKI mouse and human kidney-2 (HK-2) cell models to evaluate the renal protective effect of eleutheroside B, an active compound in traditional Chinese medicines. MTT assay was used to detect the effect of eleutheroside B on proliferation of human HK-2 cells in presence and in absence of cisplatin. Western blot and immunostaining were used to detect the protein level of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), cleaved caspase-3, receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK)-1, and RIPK-3. Real-time PCR was used to detect the mRNA levels of chemokines (like monocyte chemotactic protein 1, MCP-1) and pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α). Flow cytometry assay was used to detect apoptosis of HK-2 cells. In vivo results showed that eleutheroside B reduced the increase in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels in the AKI model. Periodic -Schiff staining and Western blot analysis of KIM-1 showed that eleutheroside B alleviated tubular cell injury. Further, eleutheroside B reduced macrophage infiltration and production of inflammatory cytokines, inhibited the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, and inhibited apoptosis and programmed necrosis. The mechanism may be that eleutheroside B can activate the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway and its downstream pathway by downregulating the expression of IGFBP-7, thus promoting cell proliferation. Therefore, our results suggest that eleutheroside B is a potential drug for AKI treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675701>Cryopreserved human umbilical cord versus acellular dermal matrix patches for in utero fetal spina bifida repair in a pregnant rat model.</a></h1><p>Despite significant improvement in spinal cord function after in utero spina bifida (SB) repair compared with traditional postnatal repair, over half of the children who undergo this procedure do not benefit completely. This lack of benefit has been attributed to closure methods of the defect, with subsequent spinal cord tethering at the repair site. Hence, a regenerative patch or material with antiinflammatory and anti-scarring properties may alleviate comorbidities with improved outcomes. The authors' primary objective was therefore to compare cryopreserved human umbilical cord (HUC) versus acellular dermal matrix (ADM) patches for regenerative repair of in utero SB lesions in an animal model.In vivo studies were conducted in retinoic -induced SB defects in fetuses of Sprague-Dawley rats. HUC or ADM patches were sutured over the SB defects at a gestational age of 20 days. Repaired SB defect tissues were harvested after 48-52 hours. Tissue sections were immunofluorescently stained for the presence of neutrophils, macrophages, keratinocytes, meningeal cells, and astrocytes and for any associated apoptosis. In vitro meningeal or keratinocyte cell coculture experiments with the ADM and HUC patches were performed. All experiments were scored quantitatively in a blinded manner.Neutrophil counts and apoptotic cells were lower in the HUC-based repair group (n = 8) than in the ADM patch repair group (n = 7). In the HUC patch repair group, keratinocytes were present on the outer surface of the patch, meningeal cells were present on the inner surface of the patch adjacent to the neural placode, and astrocytes were noted to be absent. In the ADM patch repair group, all 3 cell types were present on both surfaces of the patch. In vitro studies showed that human meningeal cells grew preferentially on the mesenchymal side of the HUC patch, whereas keratinocytes showed tropism for the epithelial side, suggesting an inherent HUC-based cell polarity. In contrast, the ADM patch studies showed no polarity and decreased cellular infiltration.The HUC patch demonstrated reduced acute  and apoptosis together with superior organization in regenerative cellular growth when compared with the ADM patch, and is therefore likely the better patch material for in utero SB defect repair. These properties may make the HUC biomaterial useful as a "meningeal patch" during spinal cord surgeries, thereby potentially reducing tethering and improving on spinal cord function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629732>Integrated metabolomics and network toxicology to reveal molecular mechanism of celastrol induced cardiotoxicity.</a></h1><p>Celastrol (CS), an active triterpene derived from traditional Chinese medicine Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f, has been used to treat chronic , arthritis and other diseases. However, it has been reported that CS can trigger cardiotoxicity and the molecular mechanism of heart injury induced by CS is not clear. Considering the wide application of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f in clinics, it is necessary to develop an accurate and reliable method to assess the safety of CS, and to elucidate as much as possible the mechanism of cardiotoxicity induced by CS. In this study, Ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS)-based metabolomics revealed clues to the mechanism of CS-induced heart injury. Palmitic  significantly increased in plasma from CS-treated rats, and this increase resulted in oxidative stress response in vivo. Excessive ROS further activate TNF signaling pathway and caspase family, which were obtained from the KEGG enrichment analysis of network toxicology strategy. Protein expression level of caspase-3, caspase-8, bax were significantly increased by western blot. Q-PCR also showed the similar results as western blot. It means that apoptosis plays a key role in the process of celastrol induced cardiotoxicity. Blocking this signal axis may be a potential way to protect myocardial tissue.Copyright © 2019.

Dysregulated histone deacetylase (HDAC)-related epigenetic pathways have been mechanistically linked to alterations in gene expression in experimental models of cardiovascular disorders. Hitherto, the relation between HDAC and Nox in atherosclerosis is not known. We aimed at uncovering whether HDAC plays a role in mediating Nox up-regulation, oxidative stress, , and atherosclerotic lesion progression. Human non-atherosclerotic and atherosclerotic arterial samples, ApoE-/- mice, and in vitro polarized monocyte-derived M1/M2-macrophages (Mac) were examined. Male ApoE-/- mice, maintained on normal or high-fat, cholesterol-rich diet, were randomized to receive 10 mg/kg suberoylanilide hydroxamic  (SAHA), a pan-HDAC inhibitor, or its vehicle, for 4 weeks. In the human/animal studies, real-time PCR, Western blot, lipid staining, lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were employed. The protein levels of class I, class IIa, class IIb, and class IV HDAC isoenzymes were significantly elevated both in human atherosclerotic tissue samples and in atherosclerotic aorta of ApoE-/- mice. Treatment of ApoE-/- mice with SAHA reduced significantly the extent of atherosclerotic lesions, and the aortic expression of Nox subtypes, NADPH-stimulated ROS production, oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory markers. Significantly up-regulated HDAC and Nox subtypes were detected in inflammatory M1-Mac. In these cells, SAHA reduced the Nox1/2/4 transcript levels. Collectively, HDAC inhibition reduced atherosclerotic lesion progression in ApoE-/- mice, possibly by intertwined mechanisms involving negative regulation of Nox expression and .

It remains unknown whether DMB can ameliorate ulcerative colitis (UC). In this study, trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS)-induced colitis rats were treated with  extract (GAE) or DMB for 10 days. Body weight, food and water intake, rectal bleeding score, diarrhea score, and histopathological parameters were measured. Rat colon were collected to determine myeloperoxidase, nitric oxide levels, and inflammatory cytokines expression. In addition, the role of DMB on lipopolysaccharide stimulated RAW264.7 cell inflammatory response and intestine smooth muscle contraction was determined. The results showed that GAE and DMB treatment could significantly alleviate TNBS-induced UC. Colon morphological alteration, nitric oxide level, and inflammatory cytokines level, such as nitric oxide synthase, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and cyclooxygenase-2, were decreased. In addition, DMB attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide release and proinflammatory cytokine expression in RAW264.7 cells. In isolated mice intestinal tissue, DMB also reduced the intestine smooth muscle spontaneous contraction and inhibited KCl, acetylcholine, BaCl, or histamine-induced intestine smooth muscle active tension, while the active frequency was unaffected. Our results demonstrated that GAE and its active constituent DMB could inhibit TNBS-induced UC, reducing inflammatory response and alleviate colon muscle spasm, suggesting that DMB may be a good candidate for subsequent development as a multitargeting drug for UC treatment.Copyright © 2019 Ni, Liu, Yu, Chen, Liu, Chen, Ruan, Da, Zhang and Wang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652746>Puffing as a Novel Process to Enhance the Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Properties of  L.

To develop an effective yet simple process for enhancing its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, turmeric was gun-puffed at various pressures. Puffed turmeric exhibited an increase in its brown color and porous structures, indicating the occurrence of the Maillard reaction and vaporization during the process. Proximal analysis revealed that puffing did not alter the major constituents, although a very small decrease in crude fat extraction was observed under some circumstances. Total phenolic compounds in the extract were significantly increased after puffing, and subsequent assessment of antioxidant capacity, as determined using independent 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic ) (ABTS), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays, demonstrated enhanced antioxidant capacity in a puffing-pressure-dependent manner. Turmeric extract was further tested for the regulation of inflammatory responses in the murine macrophage RAW264.7 cell line. Suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced macrophages was amplified using puffed-turmeric extracts compared to the control extract. Furthermore, macrophage-activation assessment revealed downregulated expression of -relevant cluster of differentiation (CD)80 and CD86 using puffed-turmeric extract in a puffing-pressure-dependent manner. However, expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II, which controls adoptive immunity, was not affected by treatment with any of the turmeric extracts.

Toxic agents can alter exosome synthesis and bioactive cargo composition, thus allowing exosomes to serve as biomarkers of exposure and response. While human and animal studies have identified exosome biomarkers of organ toxicity, in vitro models are ideal to examine biological mechanisms of exosome function. Here, we discuss the importance of exosomes in toxicology research and describe applications of in vitro models in advancing our understanding of their role in exposure-associated disease. This discussion of new research frontiers is in commemoration of the invaluable contributions of Dr. Daniel Acosta to the field of in vitro biology and toxicology. Emerging studies have implicated exosomes as mediators of neurodegeneration by shuttling pollutant-induced pathogenic proteins and miRNAs from afflicted neurons to neighboring cells. Exosomes also provide a mechanistic link between inhalation exposures and airway , remodeling, and systemic effects. Exosomes provide the means for toxic agents to initiate oncogenic transformation and create favorable tumor microenvironments. Furthermore, exosome-mediated drug delivery can alter drug pharmacologic profiles. Expansion in this field using in vitro models is essential to unlock the potential applications of exosome biology in toxicology.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The evidence associating iTFAs with CVD risk factors is fairly consistent and studies in humans usually show a relation between iTFAs and higher levels of inflammatory markers. In contrast, studies in humans, animals and in vitro suggest that rTFAs have null or mildly beneficial effects in cardiovascular health, metabolic parameters and inflammatory markers, although the evidence is not always consistent.

Although several studies have shown that 15-LOX-1 has an antitumorigenic role in many different cancer models, including breast cancer, the role of the protein in cancer drug resistance has not been established yet. In this study, we, for the first time, aimed to show the potential role of 15-LOX-1 in acquired doxorubicin (DOX) resistance in MCF7 and HeLa cancer cell lines. Our results show that ALOX15 was transcriptionally downregulated in DOX-resistant cells compared with their drug-sensitive counterparts. Moreover, overexpression of ALOX15 in the drug-resistant cells resulted in resensitization of those cells to DOX in a cell-dependent manner. 15-LOX-1 expression could induce apoptosis by activating PPARγ and enhance the accumulation of DOX in drug-resistant MCF7 cells by altering cellular motility properties, and membrane dynamics. However, HeLa DOX cells did not show any of these effects but were susceptible to cell death when treated with 13(S)-HODE.

The present study evaluates the activity and action mechanisms of the healing properties of the aqueous extract of S. guilleminiana leaves (AESg), in experimental models in vivo and in vitro, as well as performs a phytochemical analysis of the extract.The AESg was prepared by infusion: Ten g of dry leaves powder in 1 L hot water, soaked for 15 min, filtered, lyophilized, and stored at -30 °C. Phytochemical analyses were realized by colorimetry and HPLC/ESI/MS. Its' in vitro cytotoxicity was evaluated on fibroblastic N3T3 cells. The potential of the wound healing activity in vivo was evaluated using excision and incision wound rat models, by histopathology of the injured skin along with the determination of nitric oxide, cytokines (IL-1β, IL-10, and TNF-α), and antioxidant parameters (GSH, MPO and CAT). In vitro wound healing activity was also demonstrated in scratched N3T3 cells, by measuring the proliferation/migration rate.The phytochemical analysis of the AESg revealed a strong presence of polar compounds, especially flavonoids (4 majoritarian), as well as terpenes and/or sterols (2 majoritarian). The AESg showed no toxicity in the N3T3 cell line (IC > 800 μg/mL). Topical treatment with the AESg showed an increase (p < 0.05) in wound contraction with 2 mg/g cream on days 5 and 9 (43.56% and 6.70% increase, respectively), and with 50 mg/g on days 7 and 9 (10.88% and 7.91%, respectively), compared to the vehicle (non-ionic neutral cream). Topical application of AESg (2 or 50 mg/g non-ionic cream) in incised wounds caused an increase in the force necessary for the rupture of the wound when compared to the vehicle group. No changes in cytokines (IL-1β, IL-10, or TNF-α) or NO accumulation was found with up to 50 mg/g AESg treatment. For antioxidant activity on the incision wound, an increase in GSH levels was denoted with the AESg use, at the lowest and highest dose (2 and 50 mg/g) by 75.86% and 61.20% respectively, when compared to the vehicle. Also, the CAT activity was accentuated by AESg at the highest dose (50 mg/g) by 85.87%. Finally, the AESg at all doses attenuated MPO activity significantly in the incision wound by 71.35%, 73.21%, 78.08%, respectively. In the scratch test on N3T3 cells, the treatment with AESg resulted also in an increase in fibroblast proliferation/migration rate, compared to the vehicle.AESg is not cytotoxic. The results confirm the popular use of the leaf infusion of S. guilleminiana for the treatment of cutaneous wounds, possibly by stimulating the proliferation of fibroblasts with a consequent deposition of collagen, fastening rearrangement of collagen fibers, and greater transformation into myofibroblasts, essential in the healing process. Preliminary chemical analyzes of AESg revealed the presence mainly of phenolic compounds, being salicylic , gallic , pinocembrin and isoquercitrin the majoritarian ones.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Metabolomics is a relatively new field in "omics" sciences enabling the identification of metabolome for better diagnostics and studying of diseases phenotype. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of targeted metabolomics study for better understanding of the bronchial asthma pathophysiology and finding potential biomarkers in experimental models of eosinophilic . Plasma level of 185 metabolites was measured with the AbsoluteIDQ™ p180 kit in guinea pigs with experimentally-induced allergic  (n = 15) compared to naïve non-sensitised and non-challenged controls (n = 18). Of the 185 metabolites identified in plasma, 22 were significantly different and changed in ovalbumin sensitised animals. Plasma level of 13 phosphatidylcholines with saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty , total phosphatidylcholines count, carnitine, symmetric dimethylarginine and its ratio to total unmodified arginine, and kynurenine to tryptophan ratio were found to be decreased, while total phosphatidylcholines, phospholipase A2 activity indicator, tryptophan, taurine and ratio of methionine sulfoxide to unmodified methionine were found to be increased in sensitised guinea pigs compared to naïve controls. Targeted metabolomic analysis revealed significant differences in plasma metabolome of sensitised guinea pigs. Our observations point to the activation of inflammatory and immune pathways, as well as the involvement of oxidative stress.Copyright © 2019.

The goal of the present study is to further examine the wound healing effects of TY001 in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Full-thickness skin excision wounds were created with 8-mm biopsy punches and TY001 was administered via the drinking water (15, 30, and 45 g/L in emulsion) for 15 days. Wound healing was delayed in diabetic mice but was promoted by TY001 after 5, 10, or 15 days of treatment. Collagen deposition and tissue hydroxyproline contents were increased by TY001. The expressions of insulin growth factor-1, basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth facts β1, vascular endothelial growth factor, and epidermal growth factor were increased by TY001 as evidenced by immunobiochemistry and qPCR. Diabetes-associated serum pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-8 were decreased, while anti-inflammatory IL-10 and nitric oxide were increased by TY001, along with increased tissue antioxidant superoxide dismutase and catalase activities. Diabetes-reduced serum protein levels were also recovered by TY001. Taken together, Tilapia collagen peptide mixture TY001 was effective in enhancing diabetes-associated wound healing delay, probably via increasing growth factors and collagen deposition in the wound, attenuating diabetes-induced prolonged , increasing tissue antioxidants, and providing nutritional supports in diabetic mice.

The data of 185 patients with septic shock admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Anhui Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Anhui Medical University from March 2016 to December 2018 were enrolled. Routine blood test, blood biochemistry, blood gas analysis, myoglobin (Myo), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), blood lactic  (Lac), procalcitonin (PCT) and ratio of C-reactive protein and albumin (CRP/ALB) of patients on the day of septic shock diagnosis were collected. Glasgow coma scale (GCS), quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) and multiple organ dysfunction score (MODS) as well as the time from hospitalization to septic shock and duration of mechanical ventilation were recorded. The patients were divided into death group and survival group according to whether they survived or not on 28 days. According to Myo level, the patients were divided into two groups: Myo elevation group (Myo > 98 μg/L) and Myo normal group (Myo ≤ 98 μg/L). Patients with Myo elevation were divided into survival subgroup and death subgroup according to the prognosis of 28 days. The clinical data were compared among the groups, and the influencing factors of prognosis in septic shock patients were screened by multivariate Logistic regression analysis.185 patients were all enrolled in the final analysis, there were 106 deaths and 79 survivors on 28 days, 154 patients with elevated Myo and 31 patients with normal Myo. (1) Compared with the patients with septic shock in the survival group, the death group had older patients, increased qSOFA, APACHE II, MODS scores and blood Myo, Lac, PCT levels, faster heart rate, decreased GCS score, and shorter time from hospitalization to septic shock and duration of mechanical ventilation. However, there was no significant difference in cTnI or CRP/Alb between the two groups. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.037, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.010-1.065, P = 0.007], heart rate (OR = 1.020, 95%CI was 1.003-1.037, P = 0.023), qSOFA score (OR = 2.839, 95%CI was 1.321-6.102, P = 0.008), Myo (OR = 1.492, 95%CI was 1.088-2.045, P = 0.013), time from hospitalization to septic shock (OR = 0.938, 95%CI was 0.898-0.980, P = 0.004) and duration of mechanical ventilation (OR = 0.936, 95%CI was 0.899-0.975, P = 0.001) were independent risk factors for prognosis in patients with septic shock. (2) Compared with Myo normal group, the Myo elevation group had higher 28-day mortality [61.0% (94/154) vs. 38.7% (12/31), χ = 5.259, P = 0.022]. Compared with the survival patients with elevated Myo, the death patients were older, and had higher PCT and qSOFA score, faster heart rate, lower GCS score, and shorter time from hospitalization to septic shock and duration of mechanical ventilation. But there was no significant difference in CRP/Alb between the two groups. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that qSOFA score (OR = 2.796, 95%CI was 1.270-6.153, P = 0.011), time from hospitalization to septic shock (OR = 0.925, 95%CI was 0.884-0.967, P = 0.001) and duration of mechanical ventilation (OR = 0.931, 95%CI was 0.884-0.980, P = 0.006) were independent risk factors for the prognosis in the septic shock patients with elevated blood Myo.Age, heart rate, qSOFA score, Myo, time from hospitalization to septic shock, duration of mechanical ventilation were independent risk factors for the prognosis of patients with septic shock. The 28-day mortality in patients with elevated blood Myo was significantly higher than that in those with normal blood Myo. The qSOFA score, time from hospitalization to septic shock and duration of mechanical ventilation were independent risk factors for the prognosis of septic shock patients with elevated blood Myo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613032>Zoledronic  associated orbital .</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657664>Cyanidin-3--Glucoside and Cyanidin Protect Against Intestinal Barrier Damage and 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic -Induced Colitis.</a></h1><p>Anthocyanin-rich extracts have shown anti- activity in mouse colitis models. Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) is one of the widespread anthocyanins in plants, and cyanidin (Cy) is the aglycone of C3G that can be generated in intestine under gut microorganism metabolism. To explore the anti-inflammatory activity of single anthocyanins compound and show the potential mechanism, the protective effects of C3G and its aglycone Cy on 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Caco-2 cellular monolayer  were studied. The results showed that both C3G and Cy significantly improved the clinical symptoms and relieved the histological damage in TNBS-challenged mice. The activity of myeloperoxidase and the excretion of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and interferon- were also significantly inhibited at the administration dosage of 200 mol/kg.  studies showed that when LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells were pretreated with C3G and Cy, the destruction of the intestinal epithelial barrier was ameliorated due to the improvement of the transepithelial electrical resistance and Lucifer yellow flux values, while there were no significant difference between C3G and Cy groups at the same dosage. Similarly, both C3G and Cy suppressed nitric oxide production and inflammatory cytokines secretion of LPS-induced Caco-2 cells. C3G and its aglycone Cy had similar anti-inflammatory activity in both colitis mice and Caco-2 cells. The results suggest that C3G and Cy may exert anti-inflammatory effects by protecting the intestinal barrier as well as by suppressing inflammatory cytokine secretion. Thus, C3G or Cy could be potential preventive agents or supplementary medicines for inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663502>Monocyte to Lymphocyte Ratio, Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio, and Red Cell Distribution Width are the Associates with Gouty Arthritis.</a></h1><p>Neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages activations are associated with a gout attack.

Very little has been done in terms of the effect of PUFAs on cell death, especially on DNA virus. In this study, we demonstrated that the infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) can induce host cell death via the apoptotic cell death pathway, which correlated to modulation by PUFAs in grouper fin cell line (GF-1) cells. We screened the PUFAs, including docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), for the ability of different dosages to prevent cell death in GF-1 cells with ISKNV infection. In the results, each 10 μM of DHA and EPA treatment enhanced host cell viability up to 80% at day 5 post-infection. Then, in Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) assay, DHA- and EPA-treated groups reduced TUNEL positive signals 50% in GF-1 cells with ISKNV infection. Then, through studies of the mechanism of cell death, we found that ISKNV can induce both the Bax/caspase-3 and Fas/caspase-8/tBid death signaling pathways in GF-1 cells, especially at day 5 post-infection. Furthermore, we found that DHA and EPA treatment can either prevent caspase-3 activation on 17-kDa form cleavage or Bid cleaved (15-kDa form) for activation by caspase-8, apparently. On the other hand, the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 was upregulated 0.3-fold and 0.15-fold at day 3 and day 5, respectively, compared to ISKNV-infected and DHA-treated cells; that this did not happen in the EPA-treated group showed that different PUFAs trigger different signals. Finally, ISKNV-infected GF-1 cells treated with either DHA or EPA showed a 5-fold difference in viral titer at day 5. Taken together, these results suggest that optimal PUFA treatment can affect cell death signaling through both the intrinsic and extrinsic death pathways, reducing viral expression and viral titer in GF-1 cells. This finding may provide insight in DNA virus infection and control.Copyright © 2019.

Since the effect of empagliflozin or other SGLT2 inhibitors on the whole cardiac metabolic profile was never analysed before, and with the purpose to contribute to elucidate the benefits at cardiac level of the use of empagliflozin, we explored the effect of the treatment with empagliflozin for six weeks on the cardiac metabolomic profile of Zucker diabetic fatty rats, a model of early stage T2DM, using untargeted metabolomics approach. Empagliflozin reduced significantly the cardiac content of sphingolipids (ceramides and sphingomyelins) and glycerophospholipids (major bioactive contributing factors linking insulin resistance to cardiac damage) and decreased the cardiac content of the fatty  transporter cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36); induced significant decreases of the cardiac levels of essential glycolysis intermediaries 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate, and regulated the abundance of several amino  of relevance as tricarboxylic  suppliers and/or in the metabolic control of the cardiac function as glutamic , gamma-aminobutyric  and sarcosine. Empagliflozin treatment activated the cardioprotective master regulator of cellular energyhomeostasis AMP-activatedproteinkinase (AMPK) and enhanced autophagy at cardiac level, while it decreased significantly the cardiac mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), chemerin, TNF-α and MCP-1, reinforcing the hypothesis of a direct role for empagliflozin in attenuating cardiac . Our results provide an advancement on the knowledge of the mechanisms linking the therapy with empagliflozin with protective effects on the development of cardiometabolic diseases whose course is associated with remarkable cardiac bioenergetics dysregulation and disarrangement in cardiac metabolome and lipidome.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the mechanisms linking ER stress and inflammatory dysregulation to PE have not been elucidated. It has been reported that thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), which can bind with and activate the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, is a key point in immune regulation. Recent experimental evidence suggests that activated NLRP3 inflammasomes can activate interleukin-1β (IL-1β) production in the placenta of patients with PE. The objective of the current study was to explore if TXNIP plays a critical signaling role linking ER stress with NLRP3 inflammasome activation in PE. We hypothesized that ER stress would induce TXNIP production, which would bind with NLRP3 inflammasomes to activate IL-1β production. These cells showed a higher protein level of NLRP3 and IL-1β, as well as a higher enzymatic activity of caspase-1, indicating enhanced inflammatory dysregulation and ER stress. Cells transfected with TXNIP siRNA showed reduced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Cells treated with 4-phenylbutyric , an inhibitor of ER stress, showed a similar result. Outgrowth of the explant with TXNIP lentivirus in H/R or tunicamycin (inducers of ER stress) was also measured to verify our hypothesis. These findings demonstrated that TXNIP could influence inflammatory dysregulation by mediating ER stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in PE. This novel mechanism may further explain the  observed at the maternal-fetal interface, which leads to placental dysfunction in a patient with PE.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654757>Analgesic and antipruritic effects of oxymatrine sustained-release microgel cream in a mouse model of inflammatory itch and pain.</a></h1><p>Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is a highly prevalent inflammatory and immune skin disease accompanied with persistent pruritus and pain. Oxymatrine (OMT) exhibits antipruritic and anti-inflammatory effects in squaric  dibutyl ester (SADBE) induced ACD mice model, but the need for frequent administration stipulated by short half-life and low bioavailability limits clinical application.To evaluate the analgesic and antipruritic effects of OMT gel (OG), OMT sustained release microgel powder (OMP) and OMT sustained release microgel cream (OMC) in SADBE induced ACD mice, with subsequent study of the mechanism and side effects (irritation) of optimal dosage form.On day 11, the thickness of the right cheek skin of mice was measured and mice spontaneous behaviors were recorded for 1.5 h. In the OMC experiment, hematoxylin-eosin and toluidine blue staining were performed on the cheek skin, and the irritation of OMC was tested on the back skin of rabbits. Blood analyzer was used to measure the counts of inflammatory cells in peripheral blood. The mRNA expressions of IL-1β, TNF-α, CXCR3, CXCL10, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A and IL-31 in cheek skin, TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels in trigeminal ganglion (TG), IFN-γ in spleen and IL-17A in thymus were measured by RT-qPCR.OMC, OMP and OG significantly decreased wipes and scratching bouts, alleviated skin . OMC required less frequent administration and is easier to apply, while its antipruritic effect was stronger than the analgesic effect. OMC rescued the deficits in epidermal keratinization and inflammatory cell infiltration, decreased the leukocyte count in peripheral blood, had no irritation to the broken rabbit's skin. Furthermore, OMC significantly down-regulated the mRNA expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, CXCR3, CXCL10, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A and IL-31 in cheek skin, TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels in TG, IFN-γ in thymus and IL-17A in spleen.We have demonstrated that OMC exhibits advanced analgesic, antipruritic and anti-inflammatory effects when compared with OG and OMP in ACD mice by regulating , chemokines, immune mediators and inhibiting the mRNA expression of TRPA1 and TRPV1. OMC has no irritation to the intact and damaged skin of rabbits.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In atherosclerosis this is associated with dyslipidemia and oxidative stress, but mechanisms linking these phenomena to macrophage activation remain incompletely understood.  To investigate mechanisms linking dyslipidemia, oxidative stress and macrophage activation through modulation of immunemetabolism, and to explore therapeutic potential targeting specific metabolic pathways.  Using a combination of biochemical, immunological, and ex vivo cell metabolic studies, we report that CD36 mediates a mitochondrial metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to superoxide production in response to its ligand, oxLDL. Mitochondrial-specific inhibition of superoxide inhibited oxLDL-induced NF-κB activation and inflammatory cytokine generation. RNAseq, flow cytometry, H-labeled palmitic  uptake, lipidomic analysis, confocal and EM imaging, and functional energetics revealed that oxLDL upregulated effectors of long-chain fatty  (FA) uptake and mitochondrial import, while downregulating FA oxidation and inhibiting ATP5A, an electron transport chain (ETC) component. The combined effect is long-chain FA accumulation, alteration of mitochondrial structure and function, repurposing of the ETC to superoxide production, and NF-κB activation. Apoe null mice challenged with high fat diet showed similar metabolic changes in circulating Ly6C monocytes and peritoneal macrophages, along with increased CD36 expression. Moreover, mitochondrial ROS was positively correlated with CD36 expression in aortic lesional macrophages.  These findings reveal that oxLDL/CD36 signaling in macrophages links dys-regulated FA metabolism to oxidative stress from the mitochondria, which drives chronic .

The impact on neuro-, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and the brain levels of monoamines and GABA were investigated.Rats were divided into the following: normal control, hypoxia model induced by sodium nitrite (75 mg/kg s.c), and hypoxic rats pre-treated with CAR (250 mg/kg), ARG (200 mg/kg), and their combination.Data revealed that hypoxia induced significant elevation of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and its receptor reflecting the stimulation of angiogenesis. Hypoxia also resulted in increased inflammatory mediators-including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). In addition, hypoxia initiates cerebral apoptosis as revealed by increased caspase-3 and BAX with reduced Bcl-2. These changes were associated with reduced brain levels of GABA and monoamines including noradrenaline (NADR), dopamine (DOP), and serotonin (SER). Pre-treatment with ARG and/or CAR significantly mitigated the neural changes induced by hypoxia and attenuated the elevated levels of NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-6, caspase-3, and BAX, while ameliorated the reduced levels of Bcl-2, NADR, DOP, SER, and GABA, with the best improvement observed with the combination. Further elevation of the angiogenic markers was observed indicating their role in boosting oxygen delivery to brain.CAR, ARG, and, importantly, their combination could effectively protect against hypoxia-induced neurotoxicity, via their angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties in addition to reversing the effect on GABA and monoamines.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648815>A double-blind randomized controlled trial of the effects of eicosapentaenoic  supplementation on muscle  and physical function in patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection.</a></h1><p>Resection of colorectal cancer (CRC) initiates , mediated at least partly by NFĸB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells), leading to muscle catabolism and reduced physical performance.

Here, we report one de novo missense variant and three de novo splice variants in RPL13, which encodes ribosomal protein RPL13 (also called eL13), in four unrelated individuals with a rare bone dysplasia causing severe short stature. The three splice variants (c.477+1G>T, c.477+1G>A, and c.477+2 T>C) result in partial intron retention, which leads to an 18-amino  insertion. In contrast to observations from Diamond-Blackfan anemia, we detected no evidence of significant pre-rRNA processing disturbance in cells derived from two affected individuals. Consistently, we showed that the insertion-containing protein is stably expressed and incorporated into 60S subunits similar to the wild-type protein. Erythroid proliferation in culture and ribosome profile on sucrose gradient are modified, suggesting a change in translation dynamics. We also provide evidence that RPL13 is present at high levels in chondrocytes and osteoblasts in mouse growth plates. Taken together, we show that the identified RPL13 variants cause a human ribosomopathy defined by a rare skeletal dysplasia, and we highlight the role of this ribosomal protein in bone development.Copyright © 2019 American Society of Human Genetics.

Inflammasome activation, IL-1 cytokine release, and death in alveolar macrophages following cSiO exposure are early and critical events that likely contribute to triggering premature autoimmune pathogenesis by this particle. Here we tested the hypothesis that DHA suppresses cSiO-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, IL-1 cytokine release, and cell death in the macrophage. The model used was the murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cell line stably transfected with the inflammasome adapter protein ASC (RAW-ASC). Following priming with LPS, both the canonical activator nigericin and cSiO elicited robust inflammasome activation in RAW-ASC cells, as reflected by IL-1β release and caspase-1 activation. These responses were greatly diminished or absent in wild-type RAW cells. In contrast to IL-1β, cSiO induced IL-1α release in both RAW-ASC and to a lesser extent in RAW-WT cells after LPS priming. cSiO-driven effects in RAW-ASC cells were confirmed in bone-marrow derived macrophages. Pre-incubating RAW-ASC cells with 10 and 25 μM DHA for 24 h enriched this fatty  in the phospholipids by 15- and 25-fold, respectively, at the expense of oleic . DHA pre-incubation suppressed inflammasome activation and release of IL-1β and IL-1α by nigericin, cSiO, and two other crystals - monosodium urate and alum. DHA's suppressive effects were linked to inhibition of LPS-induced , and  transcription, potentially through the activation of PPARγ. Finally, nigericin-induced death was inflammasome-dependent, indicative of pyroptosis, and could be inhibited by DHA pretreatment. In contrast, cSiO-induced death was inflammasome-independent and not inhibited by DHA. Taken together, these findings indicate that DHA suppresses cSiO-induced inflammasome activation and IL-1 cytokine release in macrophages by acting at the level of priming, but was not protective against cSiO-induced cell death.Copyright © 2019 Wierenga, Wee, Gilley, Rajasinghe, Bates, Gavrilin, Holian and Pestka.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617733>Attenuated Pulmonary Fibrosis in Sialidase-3 Knockout () Mice.</a></h1><p>Pulmonary fibrosis involves the formation of inappropriate scar tissue in the lungs, but what drives fibrosis is unclear. Sialidases (also called neuraminidases) cleave terminal sialic  from glycoconjugates. In humans and mice, pulmonary fibrosis is associated with desialylation of glycoconjugates and upregulation of sialidases. Of the four mammalian sialidases, we previously detected only NEU3 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from mice with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. In this report, we show that NEU3 upregulates extracellular accumulation of the pro-fibrotic cytokines IL-6 and IL-1β, and IL-6 upregulates NEU3, in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that NEU3 may be part of a positive feedback loop potentiating fibrosis. To further elucidate the role of NEU3 in fibrosis, we used bleomycin to induce lung fibrosis in wild-type C57BL/6 and mice. At 21 days after bleomycin, compared to male and female C57BL/6 mice, male and female mice had significantly less , less upregulation of other sialidases and the profibrotic cytokine active TGF-β1, and less fibrosis in the lungs. Our results suggest that NEU3 participates in fibrosis, and that NEU3 could be a target to develop treatments for fibrosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612878>Identification of early inflammatory changes in the tympanic membrane with Raman spectroscopy.</a></h1><p>The tympanic membrane (TM) is a dynamic structure that separates the middle ear from the external auditory canal. It is also integral for the transmission of sound waves. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of using Raman spectroscopy to identify early chemical changes resulting from  in the TM that can serve as an indicator of acute otitis media. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was injected trans-tympanicaly in a murine model. Presence of inflammatory response was assessed with binocular microscopy, confirmed with histopathology and immunofluorescence staining. Successful discrimination suggesting spectral differences among the control and LPS treated groups was achieved using principal component analysis. Raman imaging revealed major differences in collagen distribution and nucleic  content. Image segmentation analysis on the trichrome stained tissue sections was performed to corroborate the Raman spectra. The spectral co-localization study suggests changes in the expression of collagen IV specific signals in LPS treated samples. The overall findings of the study support prospective application of RS in the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of otitis media.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666337>Modified sites and functional consequences of 4-oxo-2-nonenal adducts in HDL that are elevated in familial hypercholesterolemia.</a></h1><p>The lipid aldehyde 4-oxo-2-nonenal (ONE) is a highly reactive protein cross-linker derived from peroxidation of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty  and generated together with 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). Lipid peroxidation product-mediated cross-linking of proteins in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) causes HDL dysfunction and contributes to atherogenesis. Although HNE is relatively well studied, the role of ONE in atherosclerosis and in modifying HDL is unknown. Here, we found that individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) had significantly higher ONE-ketoamide (lysine) adducts in HDL (54.6 ± 33.8 pmol/mg) than healthy controls (15.3 ± 5.6 pmol/mg). ONE crosslinked apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) on HDL at a concentration of > 3 mol ONE per 10 mol apoA-I (0.3 eq.), which was 100-fold lower than HNE, but comparable to the potent protein crosslinker isolevuglandin. ONE-modified HDL partially inhibited HDL's ability to protect against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor α (Tnfα) and interleukin-1β (Il-1β) gene expression in murine macrophages. At 3 eq., ONE dramatically decreased apoA-I exchange from HDL, from ~46.5% to ~18.4% (P < 0.001). Surprisingly, ONE modification of HDL or apoA-I did not alter macrophage cholesterol efflux capacity. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that Lys-12, Lys-23, Lys-96, and Lys-226 in apoA-I are modified by ONE ketoamide adducts. Compared with other dicarbonyl scavengers, pentyl-pyridoxamine (PPM) most efficaciously blocked ONE-induced protein cross-linking in HDL and also prevented HDL dysfunction in an in vitro model of . Our findings show that ONE-HDL adducts cause HDL dysfunction and are elevated in individuals with FH who have severe hypercholesterolemia.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614951>Green Tea Polyphenol (-)-Epigallocatechin Gallate (EGCG) Attenuates Neuroinflammation in Palmitic -Stimulated BV-2 Microglia and High-Fat Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h1><p>Obesity is closely associated with neuroinflammation in the hypothalamus, which is characterized by over-activated microglia and excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The present study was aimed at elucidating the effects of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on palmitic -stimulated BV-2 microglia and high-fat-diet-induced obese mice. The results indicated the suppressive effect of EGCG on lipid accumulation, pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) release, and microglial activation in both cellular and high-fat-diet rodent models.

Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) axes are thought to play some roles in the development of chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) including lupus nephritis (LN). However, detailed mechanism of TLR3-mediated Fkn expression in glomerular endothelial cells (GECs) remains to be elucidated. : We examined the effect of polyinosinic-polycytidylic  (poly IC) on Fkn expression in cultured human GECs. Fkn mRNA and protein levels were quantified by real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively.

Transdermal drug delivery offers a desirable alternative to the conventional approaches, but the performances of current available skin penetration enhancement techniques are not so satisfactory. To address these limitations, we developed a dissolving microneedle (MN) patch made of hyaluronic  (HA) with excellent water-solubility, biocompatibility, biodegradability and mechanical property. The amount of MTX encapsulated in the needles of the patch could be controlled during fabrication process for precise dosage. Interestingly, the MTX-loaded MNs successfully penetrated imiquimod (IMQ)-induced thickened epidermis in mice and delivered the drug intralesionally. Meanwhile, fast dissolution of HA endowed the MNs with operability for patients. We found the MTX-loaded MNs not only showed well-maintained inhibitory effect in vitro but also alleviated the psoriasis-like skin  in mice. Moreover, the MTX-loaded MNs were significantly more efficacious than taking the same dose of drug orally. Consequently, a higher oral dose of MTX was required for a comparable amelioration, which in turn increased its systemic toxicity.

The aim of this study was to determine the FA profile and pro-antioxidant status in sarcopenic frail elderly patients enrolled in a nutritional and physical activity program and to evaluate their correlation with clinical markers. Moreover, the possible changes, produced after a short-term clinical protocol, were evaluated. Plasma and erythrocyte FA composition and pro-antioxidant status were analyzed in sarcopenic elderly subjects recruited for the randomized clinical study and treated with a placebo or dietary supplement, a personalized diet, and standardized physical activity. Subjects were tested before and after 30 days of treatment. Pearson correlations between biochemical parameters and patients' characteristics at recruitment indicate interesting features of sarcopenic status such as negative correlation among the plasma FA profile, age, and physical characteristics. Physical activity and dietetic program alone for 30 days induced a decrease of saturated FA concentration with a significant increase of dihomo-gamma-linolenic . Supplementation plus physical activity induced a significant decrease of linoleic , omega-6 polyunsaturated FAs, and an increase of stearic and oleic  concentration. Moreover, glutathione reductase activity, which is an indicator of antioxidant status, significantly increased in erythrocytes. Changes over time between groups indicate significant differences for saturated FAs, which suggest that the amino  supplementation restores FA levels that are consumed during physical activity. A relationship between FA and clinical/metabolic status revealed unique correlations and a specific metabolic and lipidomic fingerprint in sarcopenic elderly. The results indicate the positive beneficial role of supplementation and physical activity on plasma FA status and the antioxidant system as a co-adjuvant approach in sarcopenic, frail, elderly patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644579> in acute coronary syndrome: Expression of TLR2 mRNA is increased in platelets of patients with ACS.</a></h1><p>Platelets are key components in atherogenesis and determine the course of its clinical sequelae acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

We hypothesize that alteration in platelet TLR mRNA expression is a result of  driving coronary atherosclerosis and may represent an alternative platelet activation pathway in ACS. TLR2-, TLR4- and TLR9- mRNA-expression was determined in ACS patients and compared to patients with invasive exclusion of atherosclerotic lesions of coronary arteries.A total of fifty-four patients were enrolled in this clinical retrospective cohort single centre study. Total RNA from sepharose-filtered highly purified platelets was isolated using  guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction and transcribed to cDNA using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit. To determine absolute copy numbers of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 we used plasmid based quantitative PCR with normalisation to an internal control.We found that mRNA expression levels of TLR2 but not TLR 4 and 9 are up-regulated in platelets of patients with ACS when compared to patients without coronary atherosclerosis.Our results suggest elevated TLR2 mRNA expression in platelets as a biomarker reflecting the underlying  in ACS and possibly severity of coronary atherosclerosis.

Acquisition of brown-like features (browning) in perivascular white adipose tissue (PVAT) may protect against obesity/cardiovascular disease. Most browning studies are performed in rodents, but translation to humans would benefit from a closer animal model. Therefore, we studied the browning response of ferret thoracic aortic PVAT (tPVAT) to cold. We performed global transcriptome analysis of tPVAT of 3-month-old ferrets acclimatized 1 week to 22 or 4°C, and compared the results with those of inguinal subcutaneous adipose tissue. Immunohistochemistry was used to visualize browning. Transcriptome data revealed a stronger cold exposure response of tPVAT, including increased expression of key brown/brite markers, compared to subcutaneous fat. This translated into a clear white-to-brown remodeling of tPVAT, with the appearance of multilocular highly UCP1-stained adipocytes. The pathway most affected by cold exposure in tPVAT was immune response, characterized by down-regulation of immune-related genes, with cardio protective implications. On the other hand, subcutaneous fat responded to cold by increasing energy metabolism based on increased expression of fatty  oxidation and tricarboxylic  cycle genes, concordant with lower inguinal adipose tissue weight in cold-exposed animals. Thus, ferret tPVAT responds to cold acclimation with a strong induction of browning and immunosuppression compared to subcutaneous fat. Our results present ferrets as an accessible translational animal model displaying functional responses relevant for obesity and cardiovascular disease prevention.Copyright © 2019 Reynés, van Schothorst, Keijer, Ceresi, Oliver and Palou.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660434>A Localized Chimeric Hydrogel Therapy Combats Tumor Progression through Alteration of Sphingolipid Metabolism.</a></h1><p>Rapid proliferation of cancer cells assisted by endothelial cell-mediated angiogenesis and acquired  at the tumor microenvironment (TME) lowers the success rate of chemotherapeutic regimens. Therefore, targeting these processes using localized delivery of a minimally toxic drug combination may be a promising strategy. Here, we present engineering of a biocompatible self-assembled lithocholic -dipeptide derived hydrogel (TRI-Gel) that can maintain sustained delivery of antiproliferating doxorubicin, antiangiogenic combretastatin-A4 and anti-inflammatory dexamethasone. Application of TRI-Gel therapy to a murine tumor model promotes enhanced apoptosis with a concurrent reduction in angiogenesis and , leading to effective abrogation of tumor proliferation and increased median survival with reduced drug resistance. In-depth RNA-sequencing analysis showed that TRI-Gel therapy induced transcriptome-wide alternative splicing of many genes responsible for oncogenic transformation including sphingolipid genes. We demonstrate that TRI-Gel therapy targets the reversal of a unique intron retention event in β-glucocerebrosidase 1 (), thereby increasing the availability of functional Gba1 protein. An enhanced Gba1 activity elevates ceramide levels responsible for apoptosis and decreases glucosylceramides to overcome drug resistance. Therefore, TRI-Gel therapy provides a unique system that affects the TME via post-transcriptional modulations of sphingolipid metabolic genes, thereby opening a new and rational approach to cancer therapy.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633722>EVALUATION OF PSORIASIS TREATMENT WITH ESOMEPRAZOLE - A PILOT STUDY.</a></h1><p>Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease that affects 1%-3% of Caucasian populations and may be persistent, disfiguring and stigmatising.

Inflammatory response or "joint flare" is a recognized potential side effect. However, the incidence and severity of  following IA HA injection in horses is not well documented. This study compared the effects of two IA HA formulations of different molecular weight (MW) and a saline control on clinical signs and synovial fluid markers of  in normal equine joints. Eight adult horses each had three healthy fetlock joints randomly assigned to treatment with either 1.4 mega Dalton HA, 0.8 mega Dalton HA or saline control once weekly for three weeks. Clinical evaluation and synovial fluid analysis were performed by blinded assessors. Outcomes of interest were lameness score, joint effusion score and synovial fluid white cell count and differential, total protein, viscosity and serum amyloid A. Joints injected with HA developed significant mild-to-moderate inflammatory responses often associated with lameness and joint effusion compared with saline control joints. The higher MW HA formulation elicited a significantly greater inflammatory response than the lower MW HA after the first injection. In HA injected joints, viscosity remained poor for the entire study. Both IA HA formulations in this study induced an inflammatory response in healthy equine joints. This may have implications for the use of HA in equine joints. The findings in this study are limited to the two HA formulations used.

Cardiac surgery triggers  in the heart and makes it susceptible to the incidence of AF. Therefore, anti-inflammatory drugs may reduce the rate of AF incidence in the post-surgery conditions. Immunosuppressant agents, steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (corticosteroids), non-aspirin non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine and omega-3 unsaturated fatty  (n-3 UFA) are drugs with well-known anti-inflammatory properties. The efficacy, safety and other aspects of using these drugs in the prevention of post-operative AF (POAF) have been reviewed here. Studies evaluating the efficacy of colchicine have shown that it could be effective in the prevention of POAF. However, there is a need for additional studies to find a colchicine regimen with optimal efficacy and higher tolerability. The use of corticosteroids may also be of value based on the most of meta-analyses. In the case of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  and NSAIDs, current data fail to support their efficacy in POAF prevention.

Despite advances in treatment for SAH, the prognosis remains poor. We have previously demonstrated that glycine, a non-essential amino  is involved in neuroprotection following intracerebral hemorrhage via the Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway. However, whether it has a role in inducing neuroprotection in SAH is not known. The present study was designed to investigate the role of glycine in SAH. In this study, we show that glycine can reduce brain edema and protect neurons in SAH via a novel pathway. Following a hemorrhagic episode, there is evidence of downregulation of S473 phosphorylation of AKT (p-AKT), and this can be reversed with glycine treatment. We also found that administration of glycine can reduce neuronal cell death in SAH by activating the AKT pathway. Glycine was shown to upregulate miRNA-26b, which led to PTEN downregulation followed by AKT activation, resulting in inhibition of neuronal death. Inhibition of miRNA-26b, PTEN or AKT activation suppressed the neuroprotective effects of glycine. Glycine treatment also suppressed SAH-induced M1 microglial polarization and thereby . Taken together, we conclude that glycine has neuroprotective effects in SAH and is mediated by the miRNA-26b/PTEN/AKT signaling pathway, which may be a therapeutic target for treatment of SAH injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650454>Ghrelin alleviates endoplasmic reticulum stress and -mediated reproductive dysfunction induced by stress.</a></h1><p>Psychological stress exists widely in modern society and results in the disruption of testicular tight junctions, germ cell apoptosis, and the disorder of fertility hormones and even causes infertility. Ghrelin (GHRL), a 28-amino  peptide secreted mainly by the stomach and pancreas, has been reported to alleviate male reproductive injury through inhibiting apoptosis. However, whether GHRL has a beneficial effect on psychological stress-induced testicular injury and the possible mechanisms remain poorly understood.Male mice were immobilized in Decapicone bags for 3 h daily for 14 days treated with or without GHRL (i.p. 100 mg/kg body weight).

The existence of neutrophil-rich  in colon tissues of patients with UC is one of the most significant histological features of this disease. Nonetheless, the expression of CXCR chemokine receptors which appear as the main chemical mediators governing the migration of neutrophils into the mucosal tissue of patients with UC has not been well clarified.In this experimental study, the UC model was induced in Wistar rats by administration of 2 ml 4% acetic  into the large colon through the rectum. Animals were anesthetized after 48 h; their colon tissue samples were isolated for macroscopic and histopathological examination. The expression of receptor of CXC chemokine was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) technique.Heavy infiltration of neutrophils, coagulative necrosis, and ulcers were observed in H and E staining, which pathologically proved the UC model. qRT-PCR results indicated that CXCR2 as one of the important ELR chemokine family receptors bears the highest expression in the UC group (32 fold) than the control group ( ≤ 0.05). In addition, other CXCRs of this group including CXCR1 did not possess any change ( > 0.05). In contrast, RLR negative chemokine family receptors did not show any changes with the normal group.The results showed that CXCR2 is the only receptor for CXCL family which was remarkably upregulated in experimental UC and that CXCR2 might play a significant role in the pathogenesis of UC.Copyright: © 2019 Advanced Biomedical Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663504>Effect of Non-Surgical Periodontal Therapy on the Serum Sialic  Levels in Diabetic Patients with Periodontitis.</a></h1><p>Sialic  (SA), a family of acetylated derivatives of neuraminic , an acute phase reactant by itself. It usually occurs as a terminal component at the non-reducing end of carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids. SA participates in multiple physiological functions, such as cell-to-cell interactions, cell migration and proliferation. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by rise in blood glucose level. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the periodontal tissue, leading to destruction of bone surrounding the tooth and ultimately tooth loss. There is a two way relationship between diabetes mellitus and periodontitis. Periodontitis is the sixth complication of diabetes along with retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, macrovascular disease, and altered wound healing.

The average values were 68 ± 2.6 mg percent by DPA method and 56 ± 5 mg percent by TBA (thiobarbituric  assay) method. Age and sex showed no influence on serum sialic  level. Objectives of the present study was to compare (TSSA) level in healthy subjects, subjects with (CMP) with and without (NIDDM) and its effect on non-surgical periodontal therapy. In the present study, the participants were divided into three groups: Group A, B and C. Group A consists of systemically healthy subjects, Group B consists of subjects with (CMP) while Group C consists of subjects with (CMP) with (NIDDM) and results of this study indicated that, at baseline, there were significant differences between Group A, B and Group C with respect to all the clinical parameters, including (GI), (OHI-S), (PPD), (CAL), (TSSA) and (HbA1c) levels. Thus (TSSA) level could be considered as novel biomarker in the progression of periodontal disease and diabetic status. Periodontitis could be considered as a potential, modifiable, and independent risk factor for the development of diabetes. Early detection of elevated (TSSA) level may help in interpreting the progression of periodontitis, risk of development of diabetes mellitus in future and also to prevent complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637790>Effects of a diet enriched with eicosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic and glutamine on cytokines as immunological markers for systemic  in bitches before and after ovariohysterectomy.</a></h1><p>The post-operative period can generate immunological stress and can be modulated through supplementation with the omega-3 series of polyunsaturated fatty . This study aimed to evaluate the effects of diets enriched with high doses of eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA)  and glutamine on inflammatory mediators in dogs before and after ovariohysterectomy (OVH). Twelve female dogs were divided into two groups: group A was fed a commercial diet without the addition of EPA and DHA, and group B was fed an experimental diet enriched with EPA and DHA (0.2 g/100 kcal). Experimental diet intake initiated 21 days before surgery and continued until 30 days after OVH. Parameters measured were serum cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10), C-reactive protein (CRP), IGF-1, lymphoproliferation and body composition before and after surgery. Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software considering the effects of age and diet and their interactions, and means were compared by the Tukey test. There was no difference between groups in body weight (p = .682), lean mass (p = .101) and body fat (p = .103). There were no group differences in serum concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, IGF-1, CRP and the percentage of lymphocyte proliferation. However, a time effect for TNF-α was observed (p < .001), in which T (10 days after the surgical procedure) presented lower values of this cytokine when compared to the other evaluation time points; and interaction effects between group and time were observed for serum concentrations of IL-6 (p < .001) and IL-10 (p = .002). OVH procedure was not considered invasive enough to increase inflammatory cytokines after 30 days of surgery, as well as the dosage of the EPA and DHA used before and after the surgery did not modulate the inflammatory markers.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612510>Potential roles of Citrulline and watermelon extract on metabolic and inflammatory variables in diabetes mellitus, current evidence and future directions: A systematic review.</a></h1><p>Diabetes mellitus is a prevalent endocrine disorder worldwide. Citrulline is an α-amino , which is abundant in watermelon, and a precursor of arginine and nitric oxide. Decreased bioavailability of nitric oxide is associated with insulin resistance. The present systematic review focused on the existing evidence of citrulline and watermelon extract effects on metabolic and inflammatory parameters in diabetes mellitus.A systematic search of the databases PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, ProQuest and Google Scholar was conducted for relevant papers published from inception until October 2018. All clinical trials, animal and in vitro studies published in English-language that assessed the role of citrulline and watermelon extract on diabetes mellitus, were eligible. Studies providing inadequate information were excluded.Out of 1262 articles we found, only 8 articles met the inclusion criteria for analysis. In three studies an increase in the synthesis of nitric oxide was reported with citrulline and watermelon extract supplementation. Four studies showed a significant reduction in blood glucose after supplementation with watermelon extract, and two studies reported a decrease in a number of inflammatory biomarkers following citrulline supplementation. Although citrulline intake caused a significant reduction in HOMA-IR in one study, inconsistent results were revealed on the effects of citrulline and watermelon extract on insulin levels and lipid profile.Citrulline and watermelon extract could improve nitric oxide synthesis, glycemic status and  in diabetes mellitus. However, further studies are required to shed light on the underlying mechanisms.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615096>Potential Mechanisms of Probiotics Action in the Prevention and Treatment of Colorectal Cancer.</a></h1><p>Colorectal cancer is one of the most common and most diagnosed cancers in the world. There are many predisposing factors, for example, genetic predisposition, smoking, or a diet rich in red, processed meat and poor in vegetables and fruits. Probiotics may be helpful in the prevention of cancer and may provide support during treatment. The main aim of this study is to characterize the potential mechanisms of action of probiotics, in particular the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer. Probiotics' potential mechanisms of action are, for example, modification of intestinal microbiota, improvement of colonic physicochemical conditions, production of anticancerogenic and antioxidant metabolites against carcinogenesis, a decrease in intestinal , and the production of harmful enzymes. The prevention of colorectal cancer is associated with favorable quantitative and qualitative changes in the intestinal microbiota, as well as changes in metabolic activity and in the physicochemical conditions of the intestine. In addition, it is worth noting that the effect depends on the bacterial strain, as well as on the dose administered.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649927>Osteoinductive Material to Fine-Tune Paracrine Crosstalk of Mesenchymal Stem Cells With Endothelial Cells and Osteoblasts.</a></h1><p>While stem cell/biomaterial studies provide solid evidences that biomaterial intrinsic cues deeply affect cell fate, current strategies tend to neglect their effects on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) secretory activities and resulting cell-crosstalks. The present study aims to investigate the impact of bone-mimetic material (B-MM), with intrinsic osteoinductive property, on MSCs mediator secretions; and to explore underlying effects on cells involved in bone regeneration. Human MSCs were cultured, on B-MM, made from inorganic calcium phosphate supplemented with chitosan and hyaluronic  biopolymers. Collected MSCs culture media were assessed for mediators release quantification and used further to stimulate endothelial cells (ECs) and alveolar bone derived osteoblasts (OBs). Without osteogenic supplements, MSCs committed into bone lineage forming thus 3D bone- nodules after 21 days. Despite a weak percentage of cell commitment, our data elucidate new aspects of osteoinductive material effect on MSCs functions through the regulation of the secretion of mediators involved in bone regeneration and subsequently the MSCs/ECs indirect crosstalk with osteogenesis-boosting effect. Using MSCs culture media, we demonstrate a large potential of osteoinductive materials and MSCs in bone regenerative medicine. Such strategies could help to address some insights in cell-free therapies using MSCs derived media.Copyright © 2019 Rammal, Entz, Dubus, Moniot, Bercu, Sergheraert, Gangloff, Mauprivez and Kerdjoudj.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642669>Effects of rice with different amounts of resistant starch on mice fed a high-fat diet: attenuation of adipose weight gain.</a></h1><p>Increasing the amount of resistant starch (RS) in the diet may confer protective effects against chronic diseases. Rice, a good dietary source of carbohydrates, also contains RS. However, it remains unclear if RS at the amount consumed in cooked rice has health benefit. To address the question, we examined the effects of cooked rice containing different levels of RS in a diet-induced obesity rodent model. Rice containing RS as low as 1.07% attenuated adipose weight and adipocyte size gain, induced by a moderately high-fat (HF) diet which correlated with lower leptin levels in plasma and adipose tissue. Rice with 8.61% RS increased fecal short chain fatty  (SCFA) levels, modulated HF diet-induced adipose triacylglycerol metabolism and  related genes' expression, and increased fecal triglyceride excretion. Hence, including rice with RS level at ≥ 1.07% may attenuate risks associated with consumption of a moderately high-fat diet.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640283>A Novel Hepadnavirus is Associated with Chronic Hepatitis and Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Cats.</a></h1><p>In 2015, over 850,000 people died from chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV). A novel hepatitis B-like virus has recently been identified in domestic cats. The pathogenic potential of domestic cat hepadnavirus (DCH), for which 6.5% to 10.8% of pet cats are viremic, is unknown. We evaluated stored formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsies of diseased and normal feline liver for the presence of DCH using PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH). DCH was detected in 43% (6/14) of chronic hepatitis cases and 28% (8/29) of HCCs, whereas cholangitis ( = 6), biliary carcinoma ( = 18) and normal liver ( = 15) all tested negative for DCH. Furthermore, in DCH-associated cases, the histologic features of  and neoplasia, and the viral distribution on ISH were strikingly similar to those seen with HBV-associated disease. Several histological features common in human HBV-associated hepatitis, including piecemeal necrosis and apoptotic bodies, were identified in DCH-positive cases of chronic hepatitis. In two cases of HCC examined, the proliferation index in regions that were ISH-positive was higher than in ISH-negative regions. The intracellular distribution of virus in both hepatitis and HCC demonstrated that viral nucleic  is present in both nuclear and cytoplasmic forms. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a compelling association between DCH and some cases of chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the cat that mirrors features of HBV-associated hepatopathies. Future investigations of viral epidemiology and natural history are needed to establish the impact of DCH on feline health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634462>Time-dependent alteration to the tight junction structure of distal intestinal epithelia in type 2 prediabetic mice.</a></h1><p>High-fat diet (HFD) intake has been associated with changes in intestinal microbiota composition, increased intestinal permeability, and onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this work was twofold: 1) to investigate the structural and functional alterations of the tight junction (TJ)-mediated intestinal epithelial barrier of ileum and colon, that concentrate most of the microbiota, after exposure to a HFD for 15, 30 and 60 days, and 2) to assess the effect of in vitro exposure to free fatty  (FFAs), one of the components of HFD, on paracellular barrier of colon-derived Caco-2 cells.HFD exposure induced progressive metabolic changes in male mice that culminated in prediabetes after 60d. Morphological analysis of ileum and colon mucosa showed no signs of epithelial rupture or local  but changes in the junctional content/distribution and/or cellular content of TJ-associated proteins (claudins-1, -2, -3, and occludin) in intestinal epithelia were seen mainly after a prediabetes state has been established. This impairment in TJ structure was not associated with significant changes in intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran. Exposure of Caco-2 monolayers to palmitic or linoleic  seems to induce a reinforcement of TJ structure while treatment with oleic  had a more diverse effect on TJ protein distribution.TJ structure in distal intestinal epithelia can be specifically impaired by HFD intake at early stage of T2DM, but not by FFAs in vitro. Since the TJ change in ileum/colon was marginal, probably it does not contribute to the disease onset.Copyright © 2019.

Natural products derived from plants that are rich in bioactive compounds are used by many patients with IBD. Xique-xique (Pilosocereus gounellei) is a cactus of the Caatinga family that has been used by the local population for food and medicinal purposes. The intestinal anti-inflammatory effect of xique-xique cladode juice was evaluated in the present study. A dose of 5 mL kg-1 had a protective effect on intestinal , with an improvement in macroscopic damage, and a decrease in pro-inflammatory markers and oxidative stress, in addition to preserving the colonic tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the downregulation of IL-17, NF-κB, and iNOS, and upregulation of SOCs-1, ZO-1, and MUC-2. These protective effects could be attributed to the phenolic compounds as well as the fibers present in xique-xique juice. Further studies are needed before suggesting the use of xique-xique juice as a new alternative for treating IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651577>A population-based study of inflammatory mechanisms and pain sensitivity.</a></h1><p>Two recent studies suggest that experimental pain sensitivity is associated with low-grade systemic . However, only two biomarkers have been identified and the studies were conducted in adult individuals where confounding effects of comorbid diseases cannot be excluded. We therefore tested associations between pain sensitivity and 119 -related serum biomarkers in 827 healthy adolescents (15-19 years) in the population-based Tromsø Study: Fit Futures. The main outcome measure was cold-pressor pain tolerance (CPT), tested by placing the dominant hand in circulating cold (3°C) water for a maximum of 105s. Secondary outcomes were heat and pressure pain threshold and tolerance. Twelve proteins and six fatty  were significantly associated with CPT after adjustment for possible confounding factors and correction for multiple comparisons. Of these, all fatty  and 10 proteins were protective, i.e. higher biomarkers levels were associated with increased CPT, whereas two biomarkers were associated with lower tolerance. Taken together these biomarkers predicted completion of the tolerance test with a C-statistic of 0.65. Results for heat and pressure pain tolerance were remarkably similar, strengthening the generalizability of our findings. In this cohort of young healthy individuals, we found a relationship between -related biomarkers and pain tolerance and thresholds. Biomarkers with anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects predominated, suggesting that the development of prophylactic dietary or pharmaceutical treatments may be possible.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672153>Effect of Enterococcus faecalis 2001 on colitis and depressive-like behavior in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice: involvement of the brain-gut axis.</a></h1><p>Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including those with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, have higher rates of psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety; however, the mechanism of psychiatric disorder development remains unclear. Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic  bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon  and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus. Our findings suggest a close relationship between IBD and depression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616403>Metabolic Insight of Neutrophils in Health and Disease.</a></h1><p>Neutrophils are the most abundant, short lived, and terminally differentiated leukocytes with distinct tiers of arsenals to counter pathogens. Neutrophils were traditionally considered transcriptionally inactive cells, but recent researches in the field led to a paradigm shift in neutrophil biology and revealed subpopulation heterogeneity, and functions pivotal to immunity and . Furthermore, recent unfolding of metabolic plasticity in neutrophils has challenged the long-standing concept of their sole dependence on glycolytic pathway. Metabolic adaptations and distinct regulations have been identified which are critical for neutrophil differentiation and functions. The metabolic reprogramming of neutrophils by inflammatory mediators or during pathologies such as sepsis, diabetes, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, glycogen storage diseases (GSDs), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer are now being explored. In this review, we discuss recent developments in understanding of the metabolic regulation, that may provide clues for better management and newer therapeutic opportunities for neutrophil centric immuno-deficiencies and inflammatory disorders.Copyright © 2019 Kumar and Dikshit.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618980> Extract Ameliorates High-Fat Diet-Induced Obesity in C57BL/6N Mice by Upregulating SIRT1.</a></h1><p> is widely used in Asia as a herbal medicine to treat type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and . Here, we investigated the anti-obesity effect and underlying mechanism of  extract (GPE) enriched in gypenoside L, gypenoside LI, and ginsenoside Rg3 and obtained using a novel extraction method. Five-week-old male C57BL/6N mice were fed a control diet (CD), high-fat diet (HFD), HFD + 100 mg/kg body weight (BW)/day GPE (GPE 100), HFD + 300 mg/kg BW/day GPE (GPE 300), or HFD + 30 mg/kg BW/day Orlistat (Orlistat 30) for 8 weeks. The HFD-fed mice showed significant increases in body weight, fat mass, white adipose tissue, and adipocyte hypertrophy compared to the CD group; but GPE inhibited those increases. GPE reduced serum levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol, without affecting HDL-cholesterol. GPE significantly increased AMPK activation and suppressed adipogenesis by decreasing the mRNA expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP1c), PPARγ coactivator-1α, fatty  synthase (FAS), adipocyte protein 2 (AP2), and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and by increasing that of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT1) and hormone- sensitive lipase (HSL).

We evaluated whether fermented black radish ( L. var. ; FBR) ameliorates lipid accumulation, , and hepatic fibrosis, which are characteristics of the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Fermented black radish treatment reduced lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which appeared to be associated with the downregulation of adipogenic transcription factors, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, and lipid accumulation-related genes including adipocyte protein-2 and fatty  synthase. Administration of FBR to C57BL/6J mice challenged with methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet significantly attenuated the increased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and triglyceride. In addition, treatment with FBR interestingly repressed the hepatic  induced with MCD diet, by lowering the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and suppressing the inactivation of macrophages and Kupffer cells in the liver. Fermented black radish was also shown to mitigate liver fibrosis through the inhibition of alpha-smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor beta-1, and collagen type I alpha 1 chain. Our results indicate that FBR ameliorates NAFLD and its related metabolic disease by regulating multiple pathways, suggesting that FBR may be an effective dietary supplement for ameliorating NAFLD.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that during epileptogenesis and spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) an impairment of the endogenous anti-inflammatory pathway glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-annexin A1 (ANXA1) occurs. By administrating exogenous ANXA1, we studied whether pharmacological potentiation of the anti-inflammatory response modifies seizure activity and pathophysiology. We used an  model of temporal lobe epilepsy based on intrahippocampal kainic  (KA) injection. Video-electroencephalography, molecular biology analyses on brain and peripheral blood samples, and pharmacological investigations were performed in this model. Human epileptic cortices presenting type II focal cortical dysplasia (IIa and b), hippocampi with or without hippocampal sclerosis (HS), and available controls were used to study ANXA1 expression. A decrease of phosphorylated (phospho-) GR and phospho-GR/tot-GR protein expression occurred in the hippocampus during epileptogenesis. Downstream to GR, the anti-inflammatory protein ANXA1 remained at baseline levels while  installed and endured. In peripheral blood, ANXA1 and corticosterone levels showed no significant modifications during disease progression except for an early and transient increase poststatus epilepticus. These results indicate inadequate ANXA1 engagement over time and in these experimental conditions. By analyzing human brain specimens, we found that where significant  exists, the pattern of ANXA1 immunoreactivity was abnormal because the typical perivascular ANXA1 immunoreactivity was reduced. We next asked whether potentiation of the endogenous anti-inflammatory mechanism by ANXA1 administration modifies the disease pathophysiology. Although with varying efficacy, administration of exogenous ANXA1 somewhat reduced the time spent in seizure activity as compared to saline. These results indicate that the anti-inflammatory GR-ANXA1 pathway is defective during experimental seizure progression. The prospect of pharmacologically restoring or potentiating this endogenous anti-inflammatory mechanism as an add-on therapeutic strategy for specific forms of epilepsy is proposed.-Zub, E., Canet, G., Garbelli, R., Blaquiere, M., Rossini, L., Pastori, C., Sheikh, M., Reutelingsperger, C., Klement, W., de Bock, F., Audinat, E., Givalois, L., Solito, E., Marchi, N.
