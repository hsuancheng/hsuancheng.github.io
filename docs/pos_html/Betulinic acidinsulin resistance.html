It is found in different plant organs, both as a free aglycon and as glycosyl derivatives. A wide range of pharmacological activities has been described for this triterpenoid, including antiviral and antitumor effects. In addition, several other interesting properties have been identified in the fields of immunity and metabolism, namely antidiabetic, antihyperlipidemic, and anti-inflammatory activities. Taken together, these latter three properties make  a highly interesting prospect for treating metabolic syndrome. The present review focuses on the therapeutic potential of this agent, along with several of its semisynthetic derivatives, which could open new frontiers in the use of natural product-based medicines.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30288995> improves insulin sensitivity, hyperglycemia, inflammation and oxidative stress in metabolic syndrome rats via PI3K/Akt pathways.</a></h1><p>This study investigated the influence of  on high-fructose diet-induced metabolic syndrome in rats. Oral administration of  significantly reversed high-fructose diet-mediated increase in body mass index and blood glucose. Furthermore,  restored high-fructose diet-mediated alterations in metabolic hormones (insulin, leptin and adiponectin). -mediated upregulation of protein kinase B (Akt) and phosphoinositde-3 kinase (PI3K) anulled high-fructose diet mediated depletion. Also, elevated tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6 and -8 were significantly lowered. Administration of  restored high-fructose diet-mediated increase in the levels of lipid profile parameters and indices of atherosclerosis, cardiac and cardiovascular diseases. High-fructose diet-mediated decrease in activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase) and increase in oxidative stress biomarkers (reduced glutathione, lipid peroxidation products, protein oxidation and fragmented DNA) were significantly restored by the phenolic acids. Conclusively,  improves insulin sensitivity, elevated blood glucose, inflammation and dyslipidaemia and oxidative stress in high-fructose diet-induced metabolic syndrome through the PI#Kand Akt pathways .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27894808>Protective effect of  on early atherosclerosis in diabetic apolipoprotein-E gene knockout mice.</a></h1><p>Atherosclerosis, a chronic and progressive disease, is a leading cause of endothelial dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.  (BA), a pentacyclic triterpene, has been reported to have a variety of biological effects, including anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. This study was designed to determine whether BA could prevent atherosclerosis in diabetic apolipoprotein-E gene knockout (ApoE KO) mice. The mice were treated with BA for 12 weeks to examine its beneficial effects on atherosclerosis in ApoE KO mice. Male ApoE KO mice and age-matched control group mice (C57BL/6Jms) were used as experimental systems and their systolic blood pressure, insulin resistance, and vascular inflammation were measured. BA-treated ApoE KO mice showed lowered systolic blood pressure. The metabolic parameter showed that BA decreased blood urea nitrogen, triglyceride, and total cholesterol levels. Blood glucose, insulin, glucose tolerance results, and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index were found to be better in BA-treated ApoE KO mice than untreated ApoE KO mice. Consistent with the change in lipid profiles, oil red O and H&E staining revealed that treatment with BA reduced atherosclerotic lesions such as roughened endothelial layers. BA ameliorated the reduction of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, leading to the inhibition of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and endothelin 1 (ET-1) expression. These results suggest that BA may be useful in the treatment and prevention of early atherosclerosis via the attenuation of endothelial dysfunction in diabetic ApoE KO mice.Copyright © 2017.

Mechanistic studies showed that these TAs act as hypoglycemic and antiobesity agents mainly through (i) reducing the absorption of glucose; (ii) decreasing endogenous glucose production; (iii) increasing insulin sensitivity; (iv) improving lipid homeostasis; and (v) promoting body weight regulation. Besides these promising beneficial effects, it is believed that OA, UA, and BA protect against diabetes-related comorbidities due to their antiatherogenic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. We also highlight the protective effect of OA, UA, and BA against oxidative damage, which may be very relevant for the treatment and/or prevention of T2DM. In the present review, we provide an integrative description of the antidiabetic properties of OA, UA, and BA, evaluating the potential use of these TAs as food supplements or pharmaceutical agents to prevent and/or treat T2DM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25418122>Activation of the bile acid receptor TGR5 enhances LPS-induced inflammatory responses in a human monocytic cell line.</a></h1><p>Bile acids are recognized as signaling molecules, mediating their effects both through the cell surface receptor TGR5 and the nuclear receptor FXR. After a meal, approximately 95% of the bile acids are transported from terminal ileum and back to the liver via the portal vein, resulting in postprandial elevations of bile acids in blood. During the digestion of fat, components from the microbiota, including LPS, are thought to reach the circulation where it may lead to inflammatory responses after binding TLR4 immune cells. Both LPS and bile acids are present in blood after a high-fat meal; we therefore wanted to study consequences of a possible interplay between TGR5 and TLR4 in human monocytes.The monocytic cell line U937 stably transfected with the NF-κB reporter plasmid 3x-κB-luc was used as a model system to study the effects of TGR5 and TLR4. Activation of MAP kinases was studied to reveal functional consequences of triggering TGR5 in U937 cells. Effects of TGR5 and TLR4 activation were monitored using NF-κB luciferase assay and by quantification of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 using ELISA.In this study, results show that triggering TGR5 with the specific agonist  (BA), and the bile acids CDCA or DCA, activated both the main MAP kinases ERK1/2, p38 and JNK, and the NF-κB signaling pathway. We further demonstrated that co-triggering of TLR4 and TGR5 enhanced the activation of NF-κB and the release of inflammatory cytokines in a synergistic manner compared to triggering of TLR4 alone.Thus, two different and simultaneous events associated with the digestive process coordinately affect the function of human monocytes and contribute to enhanced inflammation. Because elevated levels of circulatory LPS may contribute to the development of insulin resistance, the results from this study suggest that bile acids through the activation of TGR5 may have a role in the development of insulin resistance as well.</p></html>
