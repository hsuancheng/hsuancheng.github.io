We used a metabolomic approach to identify urine  markers before cardiac surgery, aiming to define the physiology of patients with complex CHD and to contribute to predict their neurodevelopmental outcome.In a prospective, observational, single-center study we enrolled 28 patients with complex biventricular and univentricular CHD aged less than 5 years, on stable hemodynamic conditions, and with no genetic anomalies. We analyzed urine samples, collected at the induction of anesthesia, by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Profiles of 1H NMR spectra were submitted to unsupervised (principal component) and supervised (partial least squares-discriminant) multivariate analysis. Neurodevelopment was assessed by neuropsychological and adaptive functioning testing.Principal components analysis divided CHD patients  profiles in two distinct clusters (RED and BLACK).  profiles belonging to the RED cluster showed higher levels of accumulation of citric  cycle intermediates and glucose compared to the profiles in the BLACK cluster, indicating a possible switching to anaerobic . Patients belonging to the RED cluster were significantly more prone to show an adverse neurodevelopment pattern (p = 0.01).The application of metabolomic analysis to CHD children permitted a deeper insight on their  status that could help to obtain a better understanding of the physiological implications and to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcome.© 2019 The Authors.

The exogenous application of chitosan (CTS) has gained extensive interests due to its effect on improving drought resistance. This research aimed to determine the role of exogenous CTS on annual ryegrass in response to water stress. Here, we investigated the impact of exogenous CTS on the physiological responses and transcriptome changes of annual ryegrass variety "Tetragold" under osmotic stress induced by exposing them to 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG)-6000. Our experimental results demonstrated that 50 mg/L exogenous CTS had the optimal effect on promoting seed germination under osmotic stress. Pre-treatment of annual ryegrass seedlings with 500 mg/L CTS solution reduced the level of electrolyte leakage (EL) as well as the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and proline and enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and ascorbic  peroxidase (APX) under osmotic stress. In addition, CTS increased soluble sugars and chlorophyll (Chl) content, net photosynthetic rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs), water use efficiency (WUE), and transpiration rate (E) in annual ryegrass seedlings in response to three and six days of osmotic stress. Transcriptome analysis further provided a comprehensive understanding of underlying molecular mechanisms of CTS impact. To be more specific, in contrast of non-treated seedlings, the distinct changes of gene expressions of CTS-treated seedlings were shown to be tightly related to carbon , photosynthesis, and plant hormone. Altogether, exogenous CTS could elicit drought-related genes in annual ryegrass, leading to resistance to osmotic stress via producing antioxidant enzymes and maintaining intact cell membranes and photosynthetic rates. This robust evidence supports the potential of the application of exogenous CTS, which will be helpful for determining the suitability and productivity of agricultural crops.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671697>Why Bile  Are So Important in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Progression.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a complex disease, affecting not just the liver, but also all other organs in the body. Despite an increasing amount of people worldwide developing NAFLD and having it progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and potentially cirrhosis, there is still no approved therapy. Therefore, huge efforts are being made to find and develop a successful treatment. One of the special interests is understanding the liver-gut axis and especially the role of bile  in the progression of NAFLD. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-agonists have been approved und used in other liver diseases, such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and have shown signs of being able to decrease inflammation and potentially steatosis. This review will mainly focus on targets/ligands that play an important role in bile   and give an overview of ongoing clinical as well as pre-clinical trials. With the complexity of the issue, we did not aim at giving a complete review, rather highlighting important targets and potential treatments that could be approved for NAFLD/NASH treatment within the next few years.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661889>Combined Exposure to Fructose and Bisphenol A Exacerbates Abnormal Lipid  in Liver of Developmental Male Rats.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether combined exposure to fructose and bisphenol A (BPA) has a synergistic effect on abnormal lipid  in the liver of developmental male rats and its possible mechanism. Fifty weaned male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: the control, 13% fructose, 20% fructose, 1 µg/mL BPA, and 13% fructose + 1 µg/mL BPA (combined exposure). Rats were exposed to fructose and/or BPA through drinking water for eight weeks. Genes or proteins regulating lipid  include sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty  synthase (FAS), zinc α 2 glycoprotein (ZAG) and estrogen receptor α (ERα), and the expression of proteins regulating inflammatory response, such as TLR4 and NF-κB, were determined. Serum total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), low, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, HDL-C), blood glucose, insulin, IL-17 and TNF-α levels were also measured. Liver tissue morphology was observed by H&E staining. The results showed that the levels of gene and protein catalyzing lipogenesis were increased (SREBP1, ACC1 and FAS), while those catalyzing lipolysis were decreased (ATGL, HSL and ZAG), accompanied by dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hepatic fat accumulation, and there were higher expression of TLR4 and NF-κB protein and lower expression of ERα protein in liver, and increased serum IL-17 and TNF-α levels in fructose and/or BPA exposed rats compared with controls. Moreover, the above indicators were more serious in combined exposure group than in single exposure group. Therefore, abnormal lipid  in the liver of developmental rats could be exacerbated by combined exposed to fructose and BPA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666664>LC-MS based metabolomic profiling for renal cell carcinoma histologic subtypes.</a></h1><p>Renal cell carcinomas (RCC) are classified according to their histological features. Accurate classification of RCC and comprehensive understanding of their  dysregulation are of critical importance. Here we investigate the use of metabolomic analyses to classify the main RCC subtypes and to describe the  variation for each subtype. To this end, we performed metabolomic profiling of 65 RCC frozen samples (40 clear cell, 14 papillary and 11 chromophobe) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. OPLS-DA multivariate analysis based on metabolomic data showed clear discrimination of all three main subtypes of RCC (R = 75.0%, Q = 59.7%). The prognostic performance was evaluated using an independent cohort and showed an AUROC of 0.924, 0.991 and 1 for clear cell, papillary and chromophobe RCC, respectively. Further pathway analysis using the 21 top metabolites showed significant differences in amino  and fatty   between three RCC subtypes. In conclusion, this study shows that metabolomic profiling could serve as a tool that is complementary to histology for RCC subtype classification. An overview of  dysregulation in RCC subtypes was established giving new insights into the understanding of their clinical behaviour and for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659697>Dissecting the target leukocyte subpopulations of clinically relevant inflammation radiopharmaceuticals.</a></h1><p>Leukocyte subtypes bear distinct pro-inflammatory, reparative, and regulatory functions. Imaging inflammation provides information on disease prognosis and may guide therapy, but the cellular basis of the signal remains equivocal. We evaluated leukocyte subtype specificity of characterized clinically relevant inflammation-targeted radiotracers.Leukocyte populations were purified from blood- and THP-1-derived macrophages were polarized into M1-, reparative M2a-, or M2c-macrophages. In vitro uptake assays were conducted using tracers of enhanced glucose or amino   and molecular markers of inflammatory cells. Both F-deoxyglucose (F-FDG) and the labeled amino  C-methionine (C-MET) displayed higher uptake in neutrophils and monocytes compared to other leukocytes (P = 0.005), and markedly higher accumulation in pro-inflammatory M1-macrophages compared to reparative M2a-macrophages (P < 0.001). Molecular tracers Ga-DOTATATE targeting the somatostatin receptor type 2 and Ga-pentixafor targeting the chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) exhibited broad uptake by leukocyte subpopulations and polarized macrophages with highest uptake in T-cells/natural killer cells and B-cells compared to neutrophils. Mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO)-targeted F-flutriciclamide selectively accumulated in monocytes and pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages (P < 0.001). Uptake by myocytes and fibroblasts tended to be higher for  radiotracers.The different in vitro cellular uptake profiles may allow isolation of distinct phases of the inflammatory pathway with specific inflammation-targeted radiotracers. The pathogenetic cell population in specific inflammatory diseases should be considered in the selection of an appropriate imaging agent.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659873>Muscle Insulin Resistance in Youth with Obesity and Normoglycemia is Associated with Altered Fat .</a></h1><p>This study aimed to phenotype and compare adipose, hepatic, and muscle insulin sensitivity (IS) in a diet- and physical activity-controlled cohort of normoglycemic youth with obesity with that of participants without obesity (controls) to distinguish early  abnormalities in pediatric obesity.Thirty-eight participants (17 in the control group [BMI < 85th percentile] and 21 youth with obesity [BMI ≥ 95th percentile]; age: 12-21 years; 76% female; Tanner stage 4-5; sedentary) were enrolled. Tissue-specific IS was measured using a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess suppression of endogenous glucose release and lipolysis by insulin. Intramyocellular lipid content was assessed by  H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hepatic fat fraction (HFF) and visceral fat were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with obesity had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral fat (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular lipid content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003). Mitochondria postexercise response was not different. In participants with obesity, muscle IS inversely correlated with HFF (r = 0.700, P = 0.002) and suppressed free fatty  concentrations (r = -0.65, P = 0.003).Inactive normoglycemic youth with obesity had decreased muscle, adipose, and hepatic IS. Free fatty  and liver fat were inversely associated with muscle IS, which argues for lipid-targeted interventions.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658614>Inducible Cardiac-Specific Deletion of Sirt1 in Male Mice Reveals Progressive Cardiac Dysfunction and Sensitization of the Heart to Pressure Overload.</a></h1><p>Heart failure is associated with profound alterations of energy  thought to play a major role in the progression of this syndrome. SIRT1 is a  sensor of cellular energy and exerts essential functions on energy , oxidative stress response, apoptosis, or aging. Importantly, SIRT1 deacetylates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), the master regulator of energy  involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty  utilization. However, the exact role of SIRT1 in controlling cardiac energy  is still incompletely understood and conflicting results have been obtained. We generated a cardio-specific inducible model of Sirt1 gene deletion in mice () to decipher the role of SIRT1 in control conditions and following cardiac stress induced by pressure overload. SIRT1 deficiency induced a progressive cardiac dysfunction, without overt alteration in mitochondrial content or properties. Sixteen weeks after  deletion an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and a higher rate of oxidative damage were observed, suggesting disruption of the ROS production/detoxification balance. Following pressure overload, cardiac dysfunction and alteration in mitochondrial properties were exacerbated in  mice. Overall the results demonstrate that SIRT1 plays a cardioprotective role on cardiac energy  and thereby on cardiac function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672943>TFEB activation in macrophages attenuates postmyocardial infarction ventricular dysfunction independently of ATG5-mediated autophagy.</a></h1><p>Lysosomes are at the epicenter of cellular processes critical for inflammasome activation in macrophages. Inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion are implicated in myocardial infarction (MI) and resultant heart failure; however, little is known about how macrophage lysosomes regulate these processes. In mice subjected to cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury and humans with ischemic cardiomyopathy, we observed evidence of lysosomal impairment in macrophages. Inducible macrophage-specific overexpression of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis (Mϕ-TFEB), attenuated postinfarction remodeling, decreased abundance of proinflammatory macrophages, and reduced levels of myocardial IL-1β compared with controls. Surprisingly, neither inflammasome suppression nor Mϕ-TFEB-mediated attenuation of postinfarction myocardial dysfunction required intact ATG5-dependent macroautophagy (hereafter termed "autophagy"). RNA-seq of flow-sorted macrophages postinfarction revealed that Mϕ-TFEB upregulated key targets involved in lysosomal lipid . Specifically, inhibition of the TFEB target, lysosomal  lipase, in vivo abrogated the beneficial effect of Mϕ-TFEB on postinfarction ventricular function. Thus, TFEB reprograms macrophage lysosomal lipid  to attenuate remodeling after IR, suggesting an alternative paradigm whereby lysosome function affects inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678511>Trichothecin inhibits invasion and metastasis of colon carcinoma associating with SCD-1-mediated metabolite alteration.</a></h1><p>Lipid  abnormalities have received intensified concerns and increased de novo synthesis of lipids is recognized as a common feature of many human cancers. Nevertheless, the role of lipid  that confers aggressive properties on human cancers still remains to be revealed. Natural compounds represent an abundant pool of agents for the discovery of novel lead compounds. Trichothecin (TCN) is a sesquiterpenoid originating from an endophytic fungus of the herbal plant Maytenus hookeri Loes. Here, we assess the association of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1) over-expression with malignant progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). Based on this association, the effect of TCN on migration and invasion of colon carcinoma cells closely related to the inhibition of SCD-1 is evaluated. We further demonstrate that reduced production of unsaturated fatty  (FAs) by blocking SCD-1 activity is beneficial for the anti-invasion effect of TCN. The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanistic connection between metabolite alterations induced by  rewiring and the aggressive tumor phenotype and further develop novel pharmacological tools for the intervention of tumor invasion associated with SCD-1-mediated metabolite alterations.Copyright © 2019.

Air exposure is an important environmental stressor during mud crab culture and transportation. Adaptive mechanisms responding to air exposure in mud crabs are still poorly understood. In this study, mud crabs were exposed to air for 120 h. Air exposure decreased total hemocyte counts, led to cytological damage, and caused high mortality. Transcriptomic analysis was conducted at 0, 6 and 96 h after air exposure. A total of 3530 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. DEGs were mainly involved in the oxidative stress response, , cellular processes, signal transduction, and immune functions. Transcriptomic analysis also revealed that genes of glycolysis and of the tricarboxylic  cycle were key factors in regulating the mud crab adaptation to air exposure.Copyright © 2019.

The abundance of E. faecalis in the intestine of silkworm is affected by fluoride exposure. However, the response mechanism of E. faecalis toward fluoride remains largely unknown. In this study, a strain of E. faecalis (named TV4), which is a symbiotic bacteria of silkworm, was isolated and characterized. Inhibition assay showed that fluoride could significantly inhibit the growth of the TV4 strain (P<0.05) after culture for 4 h. Finally, Illumina X-Ten platform was used to investigate the response mechanism of E. faecalis TV4 under fluoride exposure. We found that the TV4 strain demonstrated significant changes in its carbohydrate transport and  and energy . The transcriptome sequencing results revealed that 237 genes were differentially expressed for TV4 grown after fluoride exposure, i.e., 92 genes were differentially up-regulated and 145 genes were differentially down-regulated. Many of the down-regulated genes were involved in cell carbohydrate transport and  and energy production, whereas the up-regulated genes were mostly related to ethanolamine utilization and amino  synthesis and . Our results revealed that strain TV4 reduced its carbohydrate  and energy  and increased ethanolamine utilization and amino   to adapt and survive under fluoride exposure. This study enhances our understanding about the response mechanism of E. faecalis after fluoride exposure and has important implications for investigations on the three-way interaction among fluoride, symbiotic bacteria and silkworm.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Due to its robust properties, it is also increasingly considered for use as a cell factory. It produces several industrially important compounds such as 1,3-propanediol and reuterin natively, but for cell factory purposes, developing improved strategies for engineering and fermentation optimization is crucial. Genome-scale  models can be highly beneficial in guiding rational  engineering. Reconstructing a reliable and a quantitatively accurate  model requires extensive manual curation and incorporation of experimental data.A genome-scale  model of L. reuteri JCM 1112 was reconstructed and the resulting model, Lreuteri_530, was validated and tested with experimental data. Several knowledge gaps in the  were identified and resolved during this process, including presence/absence of glycolytic genes. Flux distribution between the two glycolytic , the phosphoketolase and Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas , varies considerably between LAB species and strains. As these  result in different energy yields, it is important to include strain-specific utilization of these  in the model. We determined experimentally that the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway carried at most 7% of the total glycolytic flux. Predicted growth rates from Lreuteri_530 were in good agreement with experimentally determined values. To further validate the prediction accuracy of Lreuteri_530, the predicted effects of glycerol addition and adhE gene knock-out, which results in impaired ethanol production, were compared to in vivo data. Examination of both growth rates and uptake- and secretion rates of the main metabolites in central  demonstrated that the model was able to accurately predict the experimentally observed effects. Lastly, the potential of L. reuteri as a cell factory was investigated, resulting in a number of general  engineering strategies.We have constructed a manually curated genome-scale  model of L. reuteri JCM 1112 that has been experimentally parameterized and validated and can accurately predict  behavior of this important platform cell factory.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678673>The effect of benzo-(1,2,3)-thiadiazole-7-carbothioic  S-methyl ester (BTH) treatment on regulation of reactive oxygen species  involved in wound healing of potato tubers during postharvest.</a></h1><p>Benzo-(1,2,3)-thiadiazole-7-carbothioic  S-methyl ester (BTH) can improve wound healing of potato tubers; however, how the chemical regulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and scavenging during wound healing is not completely understood. BTH at 100 mg·L regulated changes in ROS generation and scavenging in healing tissues of potato tubers. A higher HO content was presented in healing tissues of potato tubers, while cell membrane permeability and malondialdehyde content declined due to BTH treatment. Additionally, the activities and transcript level of enzymes related with ROS generation, including NADPH oxidase, peroxidase and polyamine oxidase, as well as enzymes involved in ROS scavenging, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione reductase, were significantly enhanced by BTH treatment. It is suggested that ROS  might play a crucial role in wound healing of potato tubers mediated by BTH during postharvest.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

For example, during amino  limitations, ATF4 in the amino  response induces expression of asparagine synthetase (ASNS), which provides for asparagine biosynthesis. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells are sensitive to asparagine depletion, and administration of the asparagine-depletion enzyme L-asparaginase is an important therapy option. ASNS expression can counterbalance L-asparaginase treatment by mitigating nutrient stress. Therefore understanding the mechanisms regulating ASNS expression is important to define the adaptive processes underlying tumor progression and treatment. Here, we show that DNA hypermethylation at the ASNS promoter prevents its transcriptional expression following asparagine depletion. Insufficient expression of ASNS leads to asparagine deficiency, which facilitates an ATF4-independent induction of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) that triggers apoptosis. We conclude that chromatin accessibility is critical for ATF4 activity at the ASNS promoter, which can switch ALL cells from an ATF4-dependent adaptive response to ATF4-independent apoptosis during asparagine depletion.  This work may also help explain why ALL cells are most sensitive to L-asparaginase treatment when compared to other cancers.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665391>A Combination of Metabolites Predicts Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet Pattern and Its Associations with Insulin Sensitivity and Lipid Homeostasis in the General Population: The Fenland Study, United Kingdom.</a></h1><p>Cardiometabolic benefits of the Mediterranean diet have been recognized, but underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.We aimed to investigate how the Mediterranean diet could influence circulating metabolites and how the metabolites could mediate the associations of the diet with cardiometabolic risk factors.Among 10,806 participants (58.9% women, mean age = 48.4 y) in the Fenland Study (2004-2015) in the United Kingdom, we assessed dietary consumption with FFQs and conducted a targeted metabolomics assay for 175 plasma metabolites (acylcarnitines, amines, sphingolipids, and phospholipids). We examined cross-sectional associations of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and its major components with each metabolite, modeling multivariable-adjusted linear regression. We used the regression estimates to summarize metabolites associated with the MDS into a metabolite score as a marker of the diet. Subsequently, we assessed how much metabolite subclasses and the metabolite score would mediate the associations of the MDS with circulating lipids, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and other  factors by comparing regression estimates upon adjustment for the metabolites.Sixty-six metabolites were significantly associated with the MDS (P ≤ 0.003, corrected for false discovery rate) (Spearman correlations, r: -0.28 to +0.28). The metabolite score was moderately correlated with the MDS (r = 0.43). Of MDS components, consumption of nuts, cereals, and meats contributed to variations in acylcarnitines; fruits, to amino  and amines; and fish, to phospholipids. The metabolite score was estimated to explain 37.2% of the inverse association of the MDS with HOMA-IR (P for mediation < 0.05). The associations of the MDS with cardiometabolic factors were estimated to be mediated by acylcarnitines, sphingolipids, and phospholipids.Multiple metabolites relate to the Mediterranean diet in a healthy general British population and highlight the potential to identify a set of biomarkers for an overall diet. The associations may involve  of phospholipid , carnitine , and development of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677970>Intersection of the Gut Microbiome and Circadian Rhythms in .</a></h1><p>The gut microbiome and circadian rhythms (CRs) both exhibit unique influence on mammalian hosts and have been implicated in the context of many diseases, particularly  disorders.

In a recent study, we suggested a third pathway for SA biosynthesis from mandelonitrile (MD) in peach plants. This pathway is alternative to the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase pathway and links SA biosynthesis and cyanogenesis. In the present work, by biochemical approaches, we studied the effect of salt stress and Plum pox virus (PPV) infection on this proposed SA biosynthetic pathway from MD. Peach plants were submitted to salt stress and Plum pox virus (PPV) infection. We studied the levels of SA and its intermediates/precursors (Phe, MD, amygdalin and benzoic ) in in vitro shoots. Moreover, in peach seedlings we analyzed the content of H2O2-related enzymes, SA and the stress-related hormones abscisic  and jasmonic . We showed that the contribution of this SA biosynthetic pathway from MD to the total SA pool does not seem to be important under the stress conditions assayed. Nevertheless, MD treatment not only affected the SA content, but it also had a pleiotropic effect on abscisic  and jasmonic  levels. Furthermore, MD modulates the antioxidative  via SA-dependent or -independent redox-related signaling . Even thought that the proposed SA biosynthetic pathway seems to be functional under stress conditions, MD, and hence CNglcs, may be operating more broadly than by influencing SA  and signaling. Thus, the physiological function of the proposed SA biosynthetic pathway remains to be elucidated.© 2019 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670366>Collaborative effects of chlorogenic  and caffeine on lipid  via the AMPKα-LXRα/SREBP-1c pathway in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.</a></h1><p>To investigate the mechanism of the combined effects of chlorogenic  (CGA) and caffeine on lipid  in high-fat diet-induced obese mice, eighty female ICR mice were randomly divided into eight groups and fed with a high-fat diet with/without CGA and/or caffeine for 14 weeks.

Fat-soluble vitamins like A and E with their antioxidant properties and mechanistic interactions with lipoproteins, have potentially a key impact on lipid  and lipidemia.The impact of micronutrients on lipid  requires further investigation including characterization of plasma lipidome following supplementation and any cause-effect on circulating lipids.In this study, we elucidate the effect and associations of a multi-micronutrient intervention in Brazilian children and teens with lipoprotein alterations and lipid .Our analysis suggests a combination of short and long-term impact of supplementation on lipid , potentially mediated primarily by α-tocopherol (vitamin E) and retinol (vitamin A). Among the lipid classes, levels of phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and cholesterol esters were impacted the most along with differential incorporation of stearic, palmitic, oleic and arachidonic . Integrated analysis with proteomic data suggested potential links to supplementation-mediated alterations in protein levels of phospholipases and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1).Associations between the observed differences in lipidemia, total triglyceride, and VLDL-cholesterol levels suggest that micronutrients may play a role in reducing these risk factors for cardiovascular disease in children. This would require further investigation.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Novel disease biomarkers and curative treatment options are strongly needed.To apply untargeted metabolomic profiling to identify pathogenic mechanisms and candidate disease biomarkers in FA.Mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomic profiling was performed on serum samples of children with either FA alone, asthma alone or both FA and asthma as well as healthy pediatric controls.In this pilot study FA subjects exhibited a disease-specific metabolomic signature as compared to both control subjects and asthmatics. In particular, FA was uniquely associated with a marked decrease in sphingolipids, as well as a number of other lipid metabolites, in the face of normal frequencies of circulating natural killer T (NKT) cells. Specific comparison of FA and asthmatic subjects revealed differences in the microbiota-sensitive aromatic amino  and secondary bile  . Children with both FA and asthma exhibited a metabolomic profile that aligned with that of FA alone but not asthma. Among children with FA, history of severe systemic reactions and presence of multiple FA were associated with changes in tryptophan metabolites, eicosanoids, plasmalogens, and fatty .Children with FA display a disease-specific metabolomic profile that is informative of disease mechanisms and severity, and which dominates in the presence of asthma. Lower levels of sphingolipids and ceramides and other metabolomic alterations observed in FA children may reflect the interplay between an altered microbiota and immune cell subsets in the gut.Copyright © 2019.

However, the effects on nutrient absorption and rumen function induced by excessive iron have not been well understood. Therefore, the purpose of present study was to investigate the impact of over-load iron on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, blood biochemistry, rumen fermentation and bacterial communities in sheep. Twenty-four German Mutton Merino cross-bred sheep with weight (42.66 ± 2.34 kg BW) were randomly divided into 4 groups, each with 6 replicates and 1 sheep per replicate. The basal diet consisted of 60% Leymus chinensis hay and 40% concentrate. The sheep in 4 groups were fed the basal diets supplemented with 50 (Control), 500 (T1), 1,000 (T2) and 1,500 (T3) mg Fe/kg as ferrous sulphate monohydrate (FeSO ·H O) respectively. And the actual contents of iron in the diet were determined to be 457.68 (control), 816.42 (T1), 1,256.78 (T2) and 1,725.63 (T3) mg/kg respectively. The experiment lasted 62 days including a 7-day  trial. During the whole experiment, the digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, neutral detergent fibre and  detergent fibre showed a quadratic increase with increasing over-load iron levels (p < .05), and maximum responses were found with 500 mg/kg supplementation. However, the response of total VFA concentration showed a quadratic decrease, as did the concentrations of propionate, butyrate and valerate (p < .05). Serum total iron-binding capacity on day 30 showed a quadratic decrease with the increase in high-dose iron, while the serum iron content increased linearly at day 60 (p < .05). Excessive iron resulted in the change in bacterial communities. An increase in over-load iron linearly decreased the abundance of bacteria in the phylum Bacteroidetes (p < .05), but linearly increased the Firmicutes (p = .037) and Proteobacteria (p = .018). In addition, there was a quadratic effect (p = .003) on the Fibrobacteres, which was higher in the 500 and 1,000 mg/kg Fe-supplemented groups. At the genus level, there were quadratic effects on the abundances of Selenomonas_1 (p = .023) and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 (p = .016). Furthermore, feeding of iron linearly increased the relative abundances of Succiniclasticum and Succinivibrionaceae_UCG-002 (p < .05). These results indicate that increasing ferrous sulphate monohydrate in diets had no negative impact on the growth performance, but it changed nutrient digestibility, blood iron parameters, rumen fermentation and bacterial communities in sheep.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672987>Rewiring carbon  in yeast for high level production of aromatic chemicals.</a></h1><p>The production of bioactive plant compounds using microbial hosts is considered a safe, cost-competitive and scalable approach to their production. However, microbial production of some compounds like aromatic amino  (AAA)-derived chemicals, remains an outstanding  engineering challenge. Here we present the construction of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae platform strain able to produce high levels of p-coumaric , an AAA-derived precursor for many commercially valuable chemicals. This is achieved through engineering the AAA biosynthesis pathway, introducing a phosphoketalose-based pathway to divert glycolytic flux towards erythrose 4-phosphate formation, and optimizing carbon distribution between glycolysis and the AAA biosynthesis pathway by replacing the promoters of several important genes at key nodes between these two . This results in a maximum p-coumaric  titer of 12.5 g L and a maximum yield on glucose of 154.9 mg g.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678070>Downregulation of PHGDH expression and hepatic serine level contribute to the development of fatty liver disease.</a></h1><p>Supplementation with serine attenuates alcoholic fatty liver by regulating homocysteine  and lipogenesis. However, little is known about serine  in fatty liver disease (FLD). We aimed to investigate the changes in serine biosynthetic  in humans and animal models of fatty liver and their contribution to the development of FLD.High-fat diet (HFD)-induced steatosis and methionine-choline-deficient diet-induced steatohepatitis animal models were employed. Human serum samples were obtained from patients with FLD whose proton density fat fraction was estimated by magnetic resonance imaging. 3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh)-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and transgenic mice overexpressing Phgdh (Tg-phgdh) were used to evaluate the role of serine  in the development of FLD.Expression of Phgdh was markedly reduced in the animal models. There were significant negative correlations of the serum serine with the liver fat fraction, serum alanine transaminase, and triglyceride levels among patients with FLD. Increased lipid accumulation and reduced NAD and SIRT1 activity were observed in Phgdh-knockout MEF and primary hepatocytes incubated with free fatty ; these effects were reversed by overexpression of Phgdh. Tg-Phgdh mice showed significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation compared with wild-type littermates fed a HFD, which was accompanied by increased SIRT1 activity and reduced expression of lipogenic genes and proteins.Human and experimental data suggest that reduced Phgdh expression and serine levels are closely associated with the development of FLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In skeletal muscle, 3-hydroxy-isobutyrate produced by valine promotes skeletal muscle fatty  uptake, resulting in the accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipids in skeletal muscle, causing skeletal muscle insulin resistance. In the liver, branched-chain α-keto  decompose in large amounts, promote hepatic gluconeogenesis, and lead to the accumulation of multiple acylcarnitines, which damages the mitochondrial tricarboxylic  cycle, resulting in the accumulation of incomplete oxidation products, oxidative stress in mitochondria, and hepatic insulin resistance. In adipose tissue, the expression of branched-chain amino  catabolic enzymes (branched-chain amino  transaminase, branched-chain α-keto  dehydrogenase) is reduced, resulting in an increased level of plasma branched-chain amino , thereby causing massive decomposition of branched-chain amino  in tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver, and inducing insulin resistance. However, branched-chain amino , as a common nutritional supplement for athletes, do not induce insulin resistance. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that exercise can enhance the mitochondrial oxidative potential of branched-chain amino , alleviate or even eliminate the accumulation of branched-chain amino  catabolic intermediates, and promotes branched-chain amino  catabolism into beta-aminoisobutyric , increasing plasma beta-aminoisobutyric  concentration, improving insulin resistance. This article reveals the mechanism of BCAA-induced insulin resistance and the relationship between exercise and BCAAs , adds a guarantee for the use of BCAAs, and provides a new explanation for the occurrence of diabetes and how exercise improves diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661482>[Identification of the Molecular Partners of Lymphocyte Phosphatase-Associated Phosphoprotein (LPAP) That Are Involved in Human Lymphocyte Activation].</a></h1><p>Lymphocyte phosphatase-associated phosphoprotein (LPAP) is a small transmembrane protein that is found in lymphocytes and is tightly associated with the phosphatase CD45. The function of LPAP is still unknown. Studies of the LPAP interactome may reveal new details of how C45 and lymphocyte signaling in general are regulated. LPAP binding partners were sought using coimmunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry, stabilization of protein complexes with chemical crosslinkers, and Blue Native electrophoresis. In addition to CD45, several proteins were identified as LPAP partners, including CD71, CD98, cytoskeletal proteins, the amino  transporter SLC1A4, and the cell signaling component HS1. It was confirmed that more than 70% of LPAP molecules were bound with CD45 in a 1 : 1 complex. The effect of CD45 on LPAP was studied in CEM and Jurkat cells with a CD45 knockout. The LPAP levels in the cells were 10% of the level in wild-type cells. In the absence of CD45, LPAP phosphorylation at Ser-153 and Ser-163 was not affected, whereas phosphorylation at Ser-99 and Ser-172 decreased significantly. Based on the results, CD45 was assumed to play a role in regulating LPAP expression and phosphorylation status.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661119>Glutamine affects T24 bladder cancer cell proliferation by activating STAT3 through ROS and glutaminolysis.</a></h1><p>Changes in  are common phenomena in tumors. Glutamine (Gln) has been documented to play a critical role in tumor growth. In this study, we aimed to to explore the mechanisms through which bladder cancer cells utilize Gln to fulfill their biosynthetic needs during proliferation. In addition, the roles of Gln in the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle, reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) expression were examined in vitro in the T24 bladder cancer cell line. The results revealed that the T24 cell line was markedly Gln‑dependent and that Gln supplementation promoted T24 proliferation through the actions of Gln as a ROS moderator and as a  fuel in the TCA cycle. Importantly, extracellular Gln deprivation deregulated the production of the transcription factor, STAT3. Additionally, STAT3 expression was affected by the degree of Gln , as regulated by Gln intermediates and ROS. Thus, on the whole, the findings of this study demonstrate that Gln promotes the proliferation of the Gln‑dependent bladder cancer cell line, T24, by supplementing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and neutralizing ROS to activate the STAT3 pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677009>Effects of Docosahexaenoic  and Its Peroxidation Product on Amyloid-β Peptide-Stimulated Microglia.</a></h1><p>Growing evidence suggests that docosahexaenoic  (DHA) exerts neuroprotective effects, although the mechanism(s) underlying these beneficial effects are not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that DHA, but not arachidonic  (ARA), suppressed oligomeric amyloid-β peptide (oAβ)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in primary mouse microglia and immortalized mouse microglia (BV2). Similarly, DHA but not ARA suppressed oAβ-induced increases in phosphorylated cytosolic phospholipase A (p-cPLA), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in BV2 cells. LC-MS/MS assay indicated the ability for DHA to cause an increase in 4-hydroxyhexenal (4-HHE) and suppress oAβ-induced increase in 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Although oAβ did not alter the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, exogenous DHA, ARA as well as low concentrations of 4-HHE and 4-HNE upregulated this pathway and increased production of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in microglial cells. These results suggest that DHA modulates ARA  in oAβ-stimulated microglia through suppressing oxidative and inflammatory  and upregulating the antioxidative stress pathway involving Nrf2/HO-1. Understanding the mechanism(s) underlying the beneficial effects of DHA on microglia should shed light into nutraceutical therapy for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679024>Effects of vitamin B6 on growth, diarrhea rate, intestinal morphology, function, and inflammatory factors expression in a high-protein diet fed to weaned piglets.</a></h1><p>Vitamin B6 (VB6) is an important coenzyme factor which participates in many  reactions, especially amino  . There are few reports on how VB6 mediates weaned piglet intestinal health. This study purposed to investigate dietary VB6 effects on growth, diarrhea rates, and intestinal morphology and function in weaned piglets fed a high-crude protein (22% CP) diet. Eighteen 21-day old weaned [(Yorkshire × Landrace) × Duroc] piglets with body weights of 7.03 ± 0.15 (means ± SEM) kg were randomly assigned into 3 VB6-containing dietary treatments. Vitamin B6 content was: 0 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg, and 7 mg/kg respectively. The feeding period lasted 14 days. The results showed that no siginificant difference existed for the growth performance. The 7 mg/kg VB6 group had a tendency to decrease diarrhea rate (P = 0.065). Blood biochemical parameters analysis demonstrated that total protein, cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein significantly increased in the 7 mg/kg VB6 group (P < 0.05). In the jejunum, no significant differences were detected for villus height, villus width, crypt depth, villus height and crypt depth ratios, and positive Ki67 counts and the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines. Vitamin B6 significantly increased the mRNA expression of SLC6A19 and SLC6A20 (P < 0.05) and decreased mRNA expression of SLC36A1 (P < 0.05). In the ileum, VB6 significantly increased villus height and villus width (P < 0.05) while decreased positive Ki67 cell counts for 7 mg/kg VB6 group (P < 0.05). Vitamin B6 had significantly increased the mRNA expression of IL-1β, TNF-α，COX-2 and TGF-β (P < 0.05). Vitamin B6 also had significantly increased mRNA expression of SLC6A19，SLC7A6, SLC7A7 and SLC36A1 (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that dietary supplementation with VB6 may affect the intestinal morphology and absorption and  of protein in weaned piglets fed a high-protein diet by altering the expression of intestinal inflammatory cytokines and amino  transporters.© The Author(s) 2019.

Obesity related  indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid , transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty  (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid  including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658997>Inflammation triggers liver X receptor-dependent lipogenesis.</a></h1><p>Immune cell function can be modulated by changes in lipid . Our studies indicate that cholesterol and fatty  synthesis increases in macrophages between 12 and 18 hours after the activation of toll-like receptors with pro-inflammatory stimuli and that up-regulation of lipogenesis may contribute to the resolution of inflammation. The inflammation-dependent increase in lipogenesis requires induction of the liver X receptors, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors, by type I interferons in response to inflammatory signals. Instead of the well-established role for liver X receptors in stimulating cholesterol efflux, we demonstrate that liver X receptors are necessary for the proper resumption of cholesterol synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Thus, liver X receptors function as bidirectional regulators of cholesterol homeostasis driving efflux when cholesterol levels are high and facilitating synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Liver X receptor activity is also required for the proper shutdown of a subset of type I interferon-stimulated genes as inflammation subsides, placing the receptors in a negative feedback loop that may contribute to resolution of the inflammatory response.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677791>Neuromedin U suppresses prolactin secretion via dopamine neurons of the arcuate nucleus.</a></h1><p>Neuromedin U (NMU) has a precursor that contains one additional peptide consisting of 33 or 36 amino  residues. Recently, we identified this second peptide from rat brain and designated it neuromedin U precursor-related peptide (NURP), showing it to stimulate prolactin release from the pituitary when injected via the intracerebroventricular (icv) route. Here, we examined whether NMU, like NURP, also stimulates prolactin release. Unlike NURP, icv injection of NMU significantly decreased the secretion of prolactin from the pituitary. This suppression of prolactin release by NMU was observed in hyper-prolactin states such as lactation, stress, pseudopregnancy, domperidone (dopamine antagonist) administration, and icv injection of NURP. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that icv injection of NMU induced cFos expression in dopaminergic neurons of the arcuate nucleus, but not the substantia nigra. Mice with double knockout of NMU and neuromedin S (NMS), the latter also binding to NMU receptors, showed a significant increase of the plasma prolactin level after domperidone treatment relative to wild-type mice. These results suggest that NMU and NURP may play important reciprocal roles in physiological prolactin secretion.Copyright © 2019.

We tested how a graded reduction in insulin impacts the source of FA used by cardiomyocytes and the cardiac adaptations required to process these FA. Methods and Results Rats injected with 55 (D55) or 100 (D100) mg/kg streptozotocin were terminated after 4 days. Although D55 and D100 were equally hyperglycemic, D100 showed markedly lower pancreatic and plasma insulin and loss of lipoprotein lipase, which in D55 hearts had expanded. There was minimal change in plasma FA in D55. However, D100 exhibited a 2- to 3-fold increase in various saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated FA in the plasma. D100 demonstrated dramatic cardiac transcriptomic changes with 1574 genes differentially expressed compared with only 49 in D55. Augmented mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation in D100 was not matched by elevated tricarboxylic  or oxidative phosphorylation. With increasing FA, although control myocytes responded by augmenting basal respiration, this was minimized in D55 and reversed in D100. Metabolomic profiling identified significant lipid accumulation in D100 hearts, which also exhibited sizeable change in genes related to apoptosis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cells. Conclusions With increasing severity of diabetes mellitus, when the diabetic heart is unable to control its own FA supply using lipoprotein lipase, it undergoes dramatic reprogramming that is linked to handling of excess FA that arise from adipose tissue. This transition results in a cardiac  signature that embraces mitochondrial FA overload, oxidative stress, triglyceride storage, and cell death.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683228>Unveiling fungal detoxification  of the cruciferous phytoalexin rapalexin A: Sequential L-cysteine conjugation, acetylation and oxidative cyclization mediated by Colletotrichum spp.</a></h1><p>The  of the phytoalexin rapalexin A, a unique indole isothiocyanate (ITC) produced by crucifers (family Brassicaceae), was investigated. Three phytopathogenic fungal species were examined: Colletotrichum dematium (Pers.:Fr.) Grove, a broad host range pathogen, C. higginsianum Sacc., a host-selective pathogen of crucifers and C. lentis Damm, a host-selective pathogen of lentils (Lens culinaris Medik.). The  of rapalexin A by C. dematium and C. higginsianum was similar, taking place via one common intermediate and two divergent , but C. lentis was unable to transform rapalexin A. Both C. higginsianum and C. dematium transformed rapalexin A to two previously undescribed metabolites, the structures of which were confirmed by chemical synthesis: N-acetyl-S-(8-methoxy-4H-thiazolo[5,4-b]indol-2-yl)-L-cysteine and 4-hydroxy-3-(4-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl)-2-thioxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic . That is, both fungal pathogens metabolized and detoxified rapalexin A by addition of the thiol group of L-Cys residue to the isothiocyanate carbon of rapalexin A, a transformation usually catalyzed by glutathione transferases. Coincidentally, this  pathway is employed by mammals and insects to detoxify isothiocyanates and other xenobiotics. Hence, C. higginsianum could be a useful model fungus to uncover genes involved in the detoxification  of ITCs and related xenobiotics. Our overall results suggest that increasing rapalexin A production in specific crucifers could increase crop resistance to certain fungal pathogens.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Two strains, VPS6 and VPS7 showed ureolytic activity, which can be used for microbial-induced calcite precipitation of As as a bioremediation option. However, As reduction and oxidation capacities were not reported in any of these bacteria. A phylogenetic tree of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences was constructed for all three bacterial isolates, including different species of As-resistant Bacillus and Sporosarcina. Furthermore, literature survey and genome mining were employed to explore the diversity of As resistance-related proteins, arsenite S-adenosylmethyltransferase (ArsM) and arsenical pump membrane protein (ArsB) among different bacteria, and the phylogenetic relatedness was studied to understand the distribution and evolution of their amino  sequences. ArsB was predominantly present in a wide variety of bacteria (347 taxa); however, ArsM was reported in comparatively fewer isolates (109 taxa). There were a total of 60 similar taxa that contained both ArsM and ArsB. Both proteins were most abundantly present in phylum Proteobacteria. Overall, this investigation enumerates As-resistant bacteria to understand the As  in the environment, and the phylogenetic analysis of As resistance-related proteins helps in understanding the functional relationship in different bacteria for their role in As mobility in the environment.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

SCFAs are known to improve host  but their underlying mechanism of action remains elusive. In this study, sixteen growing pigs were infused with saline or sodium propionate solution (25 mL, 2 mol/L), respectively through a cecal fistula twice a day during a 28 days experimental period. The results showed that the cecal infusion of the SCFA propionate decreased serum and liver triglyceride levels, and increased serum PYY secretion in growing pigs. Hepatic metabolomics identified 12 metabolites that were significantly altered by propionate. These included decreased levels of lipid  related stearic  and glycerol-2-phosphate; increased levels of TCA cycle components including malic , fructose-6-phosphate, and succinic ; and decreased levels of the amino   products aspartic  and serine. Hepatic transcriptomics demonstrated that propionate inhibited fatty  synthesis and promoted lipid  process. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that propionate accelerated gluconeogenesis and decreased glycolysis.

In obese non-diabetic adolescents, we investigated if the OGTT-time-to-glucose-peak also reflects incretin and free fatty  (FFA) responses besides insulin sensitivity and β-cell function, measured by the clamp.Obese adolescents (n=278) were categorized according to their OGTT-time-to-glucose-peak by Early-peak (at 30 min) vs. Late-peak (>30 min) groups. Body composition, visceral adipose tissue, oral disposition index (oDI) and OGTT-area under the curve (AUC) were examined. A subset of 102 participants had both hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamps to measure in vivo insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and β-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity.Compared with the Early-peak group, the Late-peak group had impaired β-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity, lower glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)-AUC, and higher FFA-AUC despite higher insulin and C-peptide-AUC. They also had lower hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity despite similar percent body fat and visceral adipose tissue, and had higher prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (all P<0.05).In obese non-diabetic youth, those with a Late-peak vs. an Early-peak glucose during an OGTT showed diminished β-cell function, blunted incretin secretion, and lower insulin sensitivity of glucose and FFA . It remains to be determined if Late-peak glucose predicts the future development of type 2 diabetes in these high-risk youth. This article is protected by copyright.

This retrospective study investigated details of the clinical course and individualized treatment plan of the center with largest experience in China.A total of 7 MMA patients undergoing LT in Beijing Friendship Hospital from June 2013 to December 2017 were enrolled in the study, whose clinical data (clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, chronological changes in urine MMA levels, treatment, etc.) during perioperative period were analyzed retrospectively. All the patients received strict postoperative management.All the 7 cases were confirmed to have isolated MMA, among which, 3 cases received living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), 4 cases received deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT). A wild fluctuate of  condition was observed within the first few days after surgery and two weeks after LT, the mean base excess of blood value (BE-B) restored to normal whereas plasma bicarbonate (HCO ) was still below normal value even with intermittent sodium bicarbonate correction. It also showed marked reduction in propionylcarnitine (C3) and C3/C2 level and the mean urine MMA by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was reduced by 81.7% (P<0.01) but remained >72× higher than upper limit of normal. The -correcting medications were administered as before.

Previous studies demonstrated hydrogen bonds between amino  side chains and DNA bases play major roles in specific protein-DNA interactions. In this paper, we investigated the roles of individual DNA strands and protein secondary structure types in specific protein-DNA recognition based on side chain-base hydrogen bonds. By comparing the contribution of each DNA strand to the overall binding specificity between DNA-binding proteins with different degrees of binding specificity, we found that highly specific DNA-binding proteins show balanced hydrogen bonding with each of the two DNA strands while multi-specific DNA binding proteins are generally biased towards one strand. Protein-base pair hydrogen bonds, in which both bases of a base pair are involved in forming hydrogen bonds with amino  side chains, are more prevalent in the highly specific protein-DNA complexes than those in the multi-specific group. Amino  involved in side chain-base hydrogen bonds favor strand and coil secondary structure types in highly specific DNA-binding proteins while multi-specific DNA-binding proteins prefer helices.© The Author(s) 2019.

Thus, based on the different opinions on the efficaciousness of morbid obesity treatments, the aim of the present study was to estimate the association of serum ghrelin and Met-enkephalins (native, five amino  and cryptic, precursor of enkephalin) concentrations with BMI value in bariatric patients within 30 postoperative days.Study were performed on 38 female patients divided into two groups: I.BMI lower than 40 kg/m2 (n=18) and II. BMI higher than 40 kg/m2 (n=20). Blood was taken before (-24h), 72 h and 30 days after the sleeve gastrectomy. Routine hematologic, anthropometric and  parameters as well as TSH, ghrelin and Met-enkephalins values were measured in all patients.There were statistically significant differences between two groups before the surgery in terms of TSH, both forms of Met-enkephalin, triglycerides concentrations, activity of ALT, GGTP and CRP. After 72 h, the serum levels of cryptic Met-enkephalin, CRP and activity of enzymes varied between the two groups of patients. Thirty days after the surgery, some  and immune parameters were still different in both female groups in favour of patients with lover BMI. However, significant differences were noticed in the levels of ghrelin (increase), native (decrease) and cryptic Met-enkephalins (increase).The activity of endogenous peptides in bariatric patients is connected with the obesity degree. Ghrelin level increases are negatively correlated with native Met-enkephalin changes shortly after bariatric surgery. The interplay of ghrelin and opioids might be consider as a predictor of postoperative weight loss success.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673279>Metabolomics profiling of Polygoni Multiflori Radix and Polygoni Multiflori Radix Preparata extracts using UPLC-Q/TOF-MS.</a></h1><p>The side effects caused by Polygoni Multiflori Radix (PMR) and Polygoni Multiflori Radix Praeparata (PMRP) have often appeared globally.

These two enantiomers behave differently in the environment due to enantioselective catabolism by microorganisms. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this enantioselective catabolism remain largely unknown. In this study, the genes (snaH and snpd) involved in the catabolism of NAP were cloned from Sphingobium sp. B2, which was capable of catabolizing both NAP enantiomers. Compared to (R)-NAP, (S)-NAP was much more rapidly transformed by the amidase SnaH, which initially cleaved the amide bonds of (S)/(R)-NAP to form (S)/(R)-2-(1-naphthalenyloxy)-propanoic  ((S)/(R)-NP) and diethylamine. The α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase Snpd, showing strict stereoselectivity for (S)-NP, further transformed (S)-NP to 1-naphthol and pyruvate. Molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis analyses revealed that when the (S)-enantiomers of NAP and NP occupied the active sites, the distance between the ligand molecule and the coordination atom was shorter than that when the (R)-enantiomers occupied the active sites, which facilitated formation of the transition state complex. This study enhances our understanding of the preferential catabolism of the (S)-enantiomer of NAP on the molecular level. This article is protected by copyright.

Cells of isolated strain NKC3-5 were 0.5-0.7 μm wide and 1.4-2.8 μm long. The strain NKC3-5T could grow at up to 20.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 10%), pH 6.5-10.0 (optimum pH 9.0), and 25-40°C (optimum 35°C). The cells were able to reduce nitrate under aerobic conditions, which is the first report in the genus Salicibibacter. The genome size and genomic G + C content of strain NKC3-5 were 3,754,174 bp and 45.9 mol%, respectively; it contained 3,630 coding sequences, 16S rRNA genes (six 16S, five 5S, and five 23S), and 59 tRNA genes. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA showed that strain NKC3-5 clustered with bacterium Salicibibacter kimchii NKC1-1, with a similarity of 96.2-97.6%, but formed a distinct branch with other published species of the family Bacillaceae. In addition, OrthoANI value between strain NKC3-5 and Salicibibacter kimchii NKC1-1 was far lower than the species demarcation threshold. Using functional genome annotation, the result found that carbohydrate, amino , and vitamin  related genes were highly distributed in the genome of strain NKC3-5. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that strain NKC3-5 had 716 pan-genome orthologous groups (POGs), dominated with carbohydrate . Phylogenomic analysis based on the concatenated core POGs revealed that strain NKC3-5 was closely related to Salicibibacter kimchii. The predominant polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol and two unidentified lipids. Anteiso-C, iso-C, anteiso-C, and iso-C were the major cellular fatty , and menaquinone-7 was the major isoprenoid quinone present in strain NKC3-5. Cell wall peptidoglycan analysis of strain NKC3-5 showed that meso-diaminopimelic  was the diagnostic diamino .

This study investigated the potential of Serratia sp. K3 (K3) assisted with straw biogas residue (SBR) or leavening fertilizer (LF) on improving the Cd migration efficiency and micro-environment in soil-vetiveria zizanioides L. system. The results showed that the  soluble Cd in soil was increased by 2.83-29.79% in treatments compared with control (CK). In addition, Cd accumulation in the roots and shoots of vetiveria zizanioides were significantly enhanced by the combination of K3 and SBR/LF. Especially, the translocation factor of Cd increased by 21.53-62.37% in groups with K3 compared with the groups without K3, correspondingly. Furthermore, SBR/LF effectively changed bacterial community structure, and improved bacterial abundance. Relative abundance of functional genes related with carbohydrate/energy/amino   were increased in groups of SBRB/LFB rhizosphere compared with CK. These results provide insight into the change of phytoremediation efficiency and soil bacterial communities in the vetiveria zizanioides rhizosphere after inoculation.

BCAA may promote insulin resistance through either mTOR-mediated suppression of insulin receptor substrate-1 or through the accumulation of toxic BCAA catabolites. Although the link between circulating BCAA and insulin resistance has been consistent, it has yet to be concluded if BCAA causally contribute to the development or worsening of insulin resistance. This work investigated the effect of leucine both with and without varying levels of insulin resistance on ,  gene expression, and insulin signaling. C2C12 myotubes were treated with and without varied concentrations of leucine up to 2mM for 24 hours both with and without varied levels of insulin resistance. Gene and protein expression were measured via qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Mitochondrial  was measured via O consumption. Leucine at 2mM increased oxidative  as well as gene expression of mitochondrial biogenesis, which was associated with increased cellular lipid content. Despite increased lipid content of leucine-treated cells, neither acute nor chronic leucine treatment at 2mM affected insulin signaling in insulin sensitive, mildly insulin resistant, or severely insulin resistant cells. Similarly, leucine at lower concentrations (0.25mM, 0.5mM, and 1mM) did not alter insulin signaling either, regardless of insulin resistance. Leucine appears to improve myotube oxidative  and related  gene expression. And despite increased lipid content of leucine-treated cells, leucine does not appear to alter insulin sensitivity either acutely or chronically, regardless of level of insulin resistance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

SR-B1 and CD36 share an affinity for a wide array of ligands. Although they exhibit similar ligand binding specificity, SR-B1 and CD36 have some very specific lipid transport functions. Whereas SR-B1 primarily facilitates the selective delivery of cholesteryl esters (CEs) and cholesterol from HDL particles to the liver and non-placental steroidogenic tissues, as well as participating in cholesterol efflux from cells, CD36 primarily mediates the uptake of long-chain fatty  in high fatty -requiring organs such as the heart, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. However, CD36 also mediates cholesterol efflux and facilitates selective lipoprotein-CE delivery, although less efficiently than SR-B1. Interestingly, the ability or efficiency of SR-B1 to mediate fatty  uptake has not been reported. In this paper, using overexpression and siRNA-mediated knockdown of SR-B1, we show that SR-B1 possesses the ability to facilitate fatty  uptake. Moreover, this function is not blocked by BLT-1, a specific chemical inhibitor of HDL-CE uptake activity of SR-B1, nor by sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate, which inhibits fatty  uptake by CD36. Attenuated fatty  uptake was also observed in primary adipocytes isolated from SR-B1 knockout mice. In conclusion, facilitation of fatty  uptake is an additional function that is mediated by SR-B1.Copyright © 2019.

Native oysters are routinely exposed to a complex mixture of contaminants that increasingly includes pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Unfortunately, the biological effects of chemical mixtures on oysters are poorly understood. Untargeted GC-MS metabolomics was utilized to quantify the response of oysters exposed to fluoxetine, N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2), diphenhydramine, and their mixture. Oysters were exposed to 1 µg/L of each chemical or mixture for ten days, followed by an eight-day depuration period. Adductor muscle (n = 14/treatment) was sampled at days 0, 1, 5, 10 and 18. Trajectory analysis illustrated that  effects and class separation of the treatments varied at each time point and that overall, the oysters were only able to partially recover from these exposures post-depuration. Altered metabolites were associated with cellular energetics (i.e., Krebs cycle intermediates), as well as amino   and the urea cycle. Exposure to these PPCPs also affected   associated with anaerobic , osmotic stress, and oxidative stress, in addition to the physiological effects of each chemical's postulated mechanism of action. Following depuration, there were fewer metabolites altered, but none of the treatments returned to their initial control values, indicating that  disruptions were long-lasting. Interestingly, the mixture did not directly cluster with individual treatments in the scores plot from partial least squares discriminant analysis, and many of its affected   were not well-predicted from the individual treatments.

After 24-h treatment, pigs were monitored to assess feed intake (FI), and samples of serum and feces were collected to investigate serum profile, microbial composition, and short chain fatty  (SCFAs). The results showed that HS decreased (P < 0.05) FI compared with the TN group. Compared with TN group, HS changed serum profile by affecting biochemical parameters and hormones related with energy  and stress response; immune indicators were also altered in HS group. Most of changes in serum profile were independent of FI reduction. Additionally, HS shifted the diversity and composition of fecal microbial community by increasing (P < 0.05) Proteobacteria and decreasing (P < 0.05) Bacteroidetes. Moreover, HS decreased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of propionate, butyrate, valerate, iso-valerate, and total SCFAs in feces with a FI-independent manner.

Its major enzymatic function is incision of AP sites. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) modifies itself and target proteins with poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), contributing to regulation of many processes. To understand molecular basis of functional cooperation between APE1 and PARP1 in BER, we examined PAR-binding activity and ADP-ribosylation of human APE1 in comparison with known targets of PARP1, using the full-length, N-terminally truncated and catalytically inactive forms of APE1. The protein binds preferentially large ADP-ribose polymers, being very similar to DNA polymerase β (Polβ) but contrasting with the scaffold XRCC1 protein. The interaction with PAR involves the universally conserved catalytic portion and the eukaryote-specific extension of APE1. The ADP-ribosylation of APE1 depends on the structure of PARP1-activating DNA, contrasting APE1 with Polβ and XRCC1. Relative levels of APE1 modification in the presence of different DNA substrates were found to correlate with affinities of the DNAs for APE1 and substrate activities in the enzymatic incision, suggesting the ADP-ribosylation to occur within the DNA-mediated ternary complex. This conclusion was confirmed by importance of the length of DNA region 3' to the AP site for the modification. Deletion of the N-terminal extension of APE1 produced no significant influence on both the ADP-ribosylation efficiency and hydrolytic stability of the modified protein, suggesting localization of target amino  in the conserved catalytic portion. The most efficient ADP-ribosylation of the catalytically inactive APE1 mutant was shown to reduce the level of PARP1 automodification, suggesting possible role of APE1 in modulating PARP1 activity. Our data on primary role of DNA in controlling the PARP-catalysed modification provide new insights into mechanisms of protein targeting for ADP-ribosylation.Copyright © 2019.

There is growing evidence that reprogramming of cellular lipid  contributes to malignant transformation and progression. Lipid  is implicated in cell differentiation and metastatic colonization and it is involved in the mechanisms of sensitivity/resistance to different anti-tumor agents. The role played by lipids in the anti-tumor activity of ATRA has never been studied.We used 16 breast cancer cell-lines whose degree of sensitivity to the anti-proliferative action of ATRA is known. We implemented a non-oriented mass-spectrometry based approach to define the lipidomic profiles of each cell-line grown under basal conditions and following treatment with ATRA. To complement the lipidomic data, untreated and retinoid treated cell-lines were also subjected to RNA-sequencing to define the perturbations afforded by ATRA on the whole-genome gene-expression profiles. The number and functional activity of mitochondria were determined in selected ATRA-sensitive and -resistant cell-lines. Bio-computing approaches were used to analyse the high-throughput lipidomic and transcriptomic data.ATRA perturbs the homeostasis of numerous lipids and the most relevant effects are observed on cardiolipins, which are located in the mitochondrial inner membranes and play a role in oxidative-phosphorylation. ATRA reduces the amounts of cardiolipins and the effect is associated with the growth-inhibitory activity of the retinoid. Down-regulation of cardiolipins is due to a reduction of mitochondria, which is caused by an ATRA-dependent decrease in the expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. This demonstrates that ATRA anti-tumor activity is due to a decrease in the amounts of mitochondria causing deficits in the respiration/energy-balance of breast-cancer cells.The observation that ATRA anti-proliferative activity is caused by a reduction in the respiration and energy balance of the tumor cells has important ramifications for the therapeutic action of ATRA in breast cancer. The study may open the way to the development of rational therapeutic combinations based on the use of ATRA and anti-tumor agents targeting the mitochondria.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666203>1-O-alkyl glycerophosphate-induced CD36 expression drives oxidative stress in microglial cells.</a></h1><p>Microglia, the tissue-resident macrophages in the central nervous system, are important for the initiation and perpetuation of neuroinflammation. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a ligand-inducible transcription factor and plays an important role in fatty  . Our previous study found that 1-O-alkyl glycerophosphate (AGP), a naturally occurring ether analog of lysophosphatidic , is a high-affinity, partial agonist of PPARγ. In this study, we investigated the role of AGP in microglial activation and illustrated the underlying molecular mechanism. We found that AGP treatment increased the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species and induced PPARγ activation in microglial cells. Interestingly, AGP also up-regulated the expression levels of the cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) scavenger receptor, a high-affinity receptor for oxidized low-density lipoproteins. The findings suggest that AGP induces PPARγ activation, enhances CD36 expression and increases the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in microglial cells.Copyright © 2019.

This class of drugs is used for the treatment of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Fenofibrate is one of the members of this class of synthetic PPARα receptor ligands. The oral administration of 0.3% fenofibrate caused a decrease in strength due to loss of body weight in laboratory animals when improving behavioural features. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of liver cells showed a genotoxic effect of fenofibrate, due to accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which could be attributed to activation of peroxisomal β-oxidation processes, as well as to the lack of increase in the expression of genes encoding antioxidant defense proteins. Treatment with fenofibrate did not cause brain mtDNA damage. It has been shown that fenofibrate induced mitochondrial β-oxidation in the brain, as indicated by the increased expression of the Acadm and Cpt1a and Ppargc1a and Ppara. The study found no effect of fenofibrate on the increase of mitochondrial biogenesis in brain and liver cells. Thus, we can conclude that fenofibrate significantly affects lipid  in the liver and brain, but in the liver it is associated with an increase of oxidative stress, resulting in mtDNA oxidative damage. However, fenofibrate-induced increase in the expression of Ppargc1a is not associated with an increase of mitochondrial biogenesis.

Accumulating data implicate a potential role of disturbed tryptophan  in IBD. Kynurenic  (KYNA), a derivative of tryptophan (TRP) along the kynurenine (KYN) pathway, displays cytoprotective and immunomodulating properties, whereas 3-OH-KYN is a cytotoxic compound, generating free radicals.The expression of lymphocytic mRNA encoding enzymes synthesizing KYNA (KAT I-III) and serum levels of TRP and its metabolites were evaluated in 55 patients with IBD, during remission or relapse [27 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 28 patients with Crohn's disease (CD)] and in 50 control individuals.The increased expression of KAT1 and KAT3 mRNA characterized the entire cohorts of patients with UC and CD, as well as relapse-remission subsets. Expression of KAT2 mRNA was enhanced in patients with UC and in patients with CD in remission. In the entire cohorts of UC or CD, TRP levels were lower, whereas KYN, KYNA and 3-OH-KYN were not altered. When analysed in subsets of patients with UC and CD (active phase-remission), KYNA level was significantly lower during remission than relapse, yet not  control. Functionally, in the whole groups of patients with UC or CD, the TRP/KYN ratio has been lower than control, whereas KYN/KYNA and KYNA/3-OH-KYN ratios were not altered. The ratio KYN/3-OH-KYN increased approximately two-fold among all patients with CD; furthermore, patients with CD with relapse, manifested a significantly higher KYNA/3-OH-KYN ratio than patients in remission.The presented data indicate that IBD is associated with an enhanced expression of genes encoding KYNA biosynthetic enzymes in lymphocytes; however, additional mechanisms appear to influence KYNA levels. Higher  conversion of serum TRP in IBD seems to be followed by the functional shift of KYN pathway towards the arm producing KYNA during exacerbation. We propose that KYNA, possibly  interaction with aryl hydrocarbon receptor or G-protein-coupled orphan receptor 35, may serve as a counter-regulatory mechanism, decreasing cytotoxicity and inflammation in IBD. Further longitudinal studies evaluating the individual dynamics of TRP and KYN pathway in patients with IBD, as well as the nature of precise mechanisms regulating KYNA synthesis, should be helpful in better understanding the processes underlying the observed changes.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682027>Pharmacokinetics of Para-Aminosalicylic  and Its 2 Major Metabolites: A Potential Relationship to the Development of Gastrointestinal Intolerance.</a></h1><p>Para-aminosalicylic  (PAS), often the last drug remaining for treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis, is notorious for causing gastrointestinal intolerance; however, the cause of PAS intolerance is uncertain. The objective of this study was to assess relationships between peak concentrations of PAS administered as a granular slow-release enteric coated formulation, and its metabolites acetyl-PAS and glycine-PAS, and intolerance. PAS and its metabolites were measured in 29 adult patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis at Brooklyn Hospital, Cape Town, randomized to receive granular slow-release enteric-coated PAS 4 g twice daily or 8 g once daily for 1 week, followed by the alternative regimen. Concentrations of PAS and its metabolites were determined by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry, and a visual analogue scale evaluated intolerance. Spearman's correlation test assessed the relationship between maximum plasma concentrations (C ) and intolerance scores. A large interindividual variability was observed for the PAS C (40.42-68.55 mg/L) following 4 g twice daily; (62.69-102.41 mg/L) for 8 g once daily and a similar wide C range found for the metabolites acetyl-PAS and glycine-PAS. Twenty-six patients reported at least 1 intolerance episode, but most visual analogue scale scores clustered around 0. Significant inverse associations were found between acetyl-PAS C and bloating (rho = -0.448; P = .025) and diarrhea (rho = -0.407; P = .044) for the twice-daily regimen and a similar inverse association found for glycine-PAS and diarrhea (rho = -0.412; P = .041). Plasma concentrations of the metabolites did not correlate with the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms, but higher metabolite concentrations correlated with lower intolerance scores; slow  of PAS and its continued presence in the intestinal tract may be the main cause of intolerance.© 2019, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672317>Protein intake and amino  supplementation regulate exercise recovery and performance through the modulation of mTOR, AMPK, FGF21, and immunity.</a></h1><p>Exercise is considered to be the best approach to improve quality of life, and together with a healthy and adequate dietary pattern, exercise represents the best strategy to reduce the risk of chronic  and inflammatory diseases, such as those related to obesity. The regularity and intensity of exercise is modulated at the molecular level in the skeletal muscle by two protein kinases, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which act as sensors of external stimuli, showing the energy status of muscular fibers. The mTOR pathway is activated by insulin and amino  availability, and its  actions culminate in increased protein synthesis and reduced autophagy, leading to an increase in muscle mass. In contrast, AMPK activation induces a transcriptional program aimed to increase the mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, transforming fast-twitch glycolytic fibers to slow-twitch oxidative fibers and increasing resistance to fatigue. In addition, inadequate exercise training induces imbalance in the immune response, generating excessive inflammation and/or immunosuppression. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that provide insight into dietary protein interventions and/or amino  supplementation that may improve outcomes after exercise by modulating 1) mTOR and AMPK activation during early exercise recovery, leading to increased muscle protein synthesis or increased oxidative capacity; 2) undesirable inflammatory responses; and 3) fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels that may have relevant implications in skeletal muscle , particularly during the exercise recovery and performance of obese subjects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Cotton reproductive failure under drought stress is intrinsically connected with altered male fertility, however, studies investigating the effect of drought stress on cotton male fertility are nonexistent. Thus, a drought stress experiment was conducted with two cotton cultivars, differing in drought tolerance, to study pollen fertility and anthers' physiology. Results indicated that drought stress reduced pollen fertility of both cultivars due to decreases in anther starch and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. Lower assimilate supply capacity in conjunction with impaired activities of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and soluble starch synthase were the main reasons for the decreased starch levels in drought-stressed anthers. The decreased activities of sucrose synthetase and  invertase were responsible for the higher sucrose level in drought-stressed anthers than well-watered anthers and the changing trend of sucrose was intensified by the decreased expressions of sucrose synthase genes (GhSusA, GhSusB, GhSusD) and  invertase genes (GhINV1, GhINV2). However, despite sucrose degradation being limited in drought-stressed anthers, glucose level was higher in droughted anthers than well-watered ones, and that might be attributed to the down-regulated respiration since decreased anther ATP levels were detected in drought-stressed plants. Furthermore, compared to the drought-tolerant cultivar, pollen fertility was more suppressed by drought stress for the drought-sensitive cultivar, and that was attributed to the larger decrease in starch and ATP contents.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678200>Re-balancing cellular energy substrate  to mend the failing heart.</a></h1><p>Fatty  and glucose are the main substrates for myocardial energy provision. Under physiologic conditions, there is a distinct and finely tuned balance between the utilization of these substrates. Using the non-ischemic heart as an example, we discuss that upon stress this substrate balance is upset resulting in an over-reliance on either fatty  or glucose, and that chronic fuel shifts towards a single type of substrate appear to be linked with cardiac dysfunction. These observations suggest that interventions aimed at re-balancing a tilted substrate preference towards an appropriate mix of substrates may result in restoration of cardiac contractile performance. Examples of manipulating cellular substrate uptake as a means to re-balance fuel supply, being associated with mended cardiac function underscore this concept. We also address the molecular mechanisms underlying the apparent need for a fatty -glucose fuel balance. We propose that re-balancing cellular fuel supply, in particular with respect to fatty  and glucose, may be an effective strategy to treat the failing heart.Copyright © 2019 The Author.

To determine maternal and fetal contributions to  flexibility during gestation, pregnant mice with genetic impairments in mitochondrial carbohydrate and/or lipid  were subjected to nutrient deprivation. The maternal fasting response initiates a fetal liver transcriptional program marked by upregulation of lipid- and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparα)-regulated genes. Impaired maternal lipid  alters circulating lipid metabolite concentrations and enhances the fetal response to fasting, which is largely dependent on fetal Pparα. Maternal fasting also improves  deficits in fetal carbohydrate  by increasing the availability of alternative substrates. Impairment of both carbohydrate and lipid  in pregnant dams further exacerbates the fetal liver transcriptional response to nutrient deprivation. Together, these data demonstrate a regulatory role for mitochondrial macronutrient  in mediating maternal-fetal  communication, particularly when nutrients are limited.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Increased UGCG synthesis is associated with pro-cancerous processes such as increased proliferation and multidrug resistance in several cancer types. We investigated the influence of UGCG overexpression on glutamine  in breast cancer cells. We observed adapted glucose and glutamine uptake in a limited energy supply environment following UGCG overexpression. Glutamine is used for reinforced oxidative stress response shown by increased mRNA expression of glutamine metabolizing proteins such as glutathione-disulfide reductase (GSR) resulting in increased reduced glutathione (GSH) level. Augmented glutamine uptake is also used for fueling the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle to maintain the proliferative advantage of UGCG overexpressing cells.

However, little is known about their effects on early recurrent miscarriage (RM). Here we aimed to investigate the role of lncRNA EPB41L4A-AS1 on placental trophoblast cell  reprogramming, which might be involved in the pathogenesis of RM. After microarray and GEO database analyses, we found that EPB41L4A-AS1 was significantly increased in early RM placental tissue, and this increase may relate to estradiol-mediated upregulation of PGC-1α. EPB41L4A-AS1 overexpression inhibits glycolysis but increases the dependence on fatty  oxidation in mitochondrion  and suppresses the Warburg effect, which is necessary for rapid growth of the placental villus, leading to miscarriage. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that EPB41L4A-AS1 functions as a lncRNA in the regulation of VDAC1 and HIF-1α expression through enhancement of H3K4me3 levels in the promoters of VDAC1 and HIF1A-AS1, a natural antisense transcript (NAT) lncRNA of HIF-1α. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that aberrant expression of EPB41L4A-AS1 is involved in the etiology of early RM, and it may be a candidate diagnostic hallmark and a potential therapeutic target for early RM treatment.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Supporting this notion, aKG supplementation can restore growth/survival of glutamine-deprived cells. However, pancreatic cancers are often poorly vascularized and limited in glutamine supply, in alignment with recent concerns on the significance of glutaminolysis in pancreatic cancer. Here, we show that aKG-mediated rescue of glutamine-deprived pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDAC) cells requires glutamate ammonia ligase (GLUL), the enzyme responsible for de novo glutamine synthesis. GLUL-deficient PDAC cells are capable of the TCA cycle but defective in aKG-coupled glutamine biosynthesis and subsequent nitrogen anabolic processes. Importantly, GLUL expression is elevated in pancreatic cancer patient samples and in mouse PDAC models. GLUL ablation suppresses the development of Kras-driven murine PDAC. Therefore, GLUL-mediated glutamine biosynthesis couples the TCA cycle with nitrogen anabolism and plays a critical role in PDAC.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In this study, a simple, rapid and sensitive method was developed for the simultaneous determination of 24 free amino  in cell samples using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS). Cell samples were deproteinized with methanol/HO (80:20, v/v) without intricate derivatization process. The analytes were separated on a Waters BEH Amide column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.7 μm), and accomplished within 5 min at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The good linearity was obtained for all analytes (r > 0.99) with the limits of quantification from 0.1 to 25 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-day precision ranged from 0.35 to 10.36% and from 2.22 to 9.93%, respectively. The recoveries of most analytes were between 80% and 120% with RSD less than 10.0%.

Planktonically grown  is known to prioritize the consumption of organic  including lactic  over catabolism of glucose using a CCR strategy termed "reverse diauxie."  is an opportunistic pathogen with well-documented biofilm phenotypes that are distinct from its planktonic phenotypes. Reverse diauxie has been described in planktonic cultures, but it has not been documented explicitly in  biofilms. Here a combination of exometabolomics and label-free proteomics was used to analyze planktonic and biofilm phenotypes for reverse diauxie.  biofilm cultures preferentially consumed lactic  over glucose, and in addition, the cultures catabolized the substrates completely and did not exhibit the acetate secreting "overflow"  that is typical of many model microorganisms. The biofilm phenotype was enabled by changes in protein abundances, including lactate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase, GTP cyclohydrolase, L-ornithine N(5)-monooxygenase, and superoxide dismutase. These results are noteworthy because reverse diauxie-mediated catabolism of organic  necessitates a terminal electron acceptor like O, which is typically in low supply in biofilms due to diffusion limitation. Label-free proteomics identified dozens of proteins associated with biofilm formation including 16 that have not been previously reported, highlighting both the advantages of the methodology utilized here and the complexity of the proteomic adaptation for  biofilms. Documenting the reverse diauxic phenotype in  biofilms is foundational for understanding cellular nutrient and energy fluxes, which ultimately control growth and virulence.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678205>Hermetia illucens (Diptera: Stratiomydae) larvae and prepupae: biomass production, fatty  profile and expression of key genes involved in lipid .</a></h1><p>The Black Soldier Fly (BSF) Hermetia illucens provides a promising strategy in the waste valorisation process and a sustainable alternative source of valuable nutrients, including lipids for food and feed. In the present study, the differences in growth performances and nutritional values of BSF V instar larvae and prepupae reared on vegetable waste were analyzed and compared focusing on fat content. V instar larvae showed higher capacity to bioconvert the substrate into biomass than prepupae. The nutritional composition and the fatty  profiles were dependent on the developmental stage. The expression levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (acc), fatty  synthase (fas), lipase (lip) and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (acd) genes involved in the lipid  pathway and herein characterized for the first time, were evaluated in order to understand the molecular basis underlying the observed differences in fatty  profiles. Our results suggest that the different fatty  profiles of BSF V instar larvae and prepupae may be related to the modulation of the lipid -related genes expression during larval development.

The central aspect of this organization is the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium that is characterized by an asynchronous repeating series of germ cell associations.

Finally, the unique applications of synchronous spermatogenesis to the study of the cycle and the mass isolation of specific germ cell populations are described.Retinoic   and spermatogonial differentiation have been examined by gene deletions, immunocytochemistry, chemical inhibitors, and mass spectrometry.Both the Sertoli cells and the germ cells have the capacity to synthesize retinoic  from retinol and in the mouse the entry into the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium and the subsequent conversion of undifferentiated spermatogonia into differentiating spermatogonia is governed by a peak of RA synthesis occurring at stages VIII-IX of the cycle.

Recent studies indicated an emerging role of these eicosanoids in  diseases and the EET signaling pathway was shown to be involved in hepatic insulin sensitivity. However, compared to vascular tissues, there is only limited knowledge about the underlying signaling  in the liver. Therefore, we employed an LC-MS/MS-based time-resolved phosphoproteomics approach to characterize 11,12-EET-mediated signaling events in the liver cell line Hepa 1-6. 11,12-EET treatment resulted in the time-dependent regulation of phosphopeptides involved in processes as yet unknown to be affected by EETs, including RNA processing, splicing and translation regulation. Pathway analysis combined with western blot-based validation revealed enhanced AKT/mTOR/p70S6K signaling as demonstrated by increased acute phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473) and p70S6K (Thr389). In addition, 11,12-EET treatment led to differential regulation of phosphopeptides including important mediators of the DNA damage response and we observed a prolonged induction of the etoposide-induced DNA damage marker γH2AX in response to 11,12-EET. In summary, our findings extend current knowledge of 11,12-EET signaling events and emphasize the importance of the AKT/mTOR/p70S6K pathway in hepatic 11,12-EET signaling.

As there are no conclusive studies on the specific effects of biochar application on tobacco quality, this study aimed to improve the yield and quality of tobacco as a model crop for economic and genetic research in southern China, by such application. We used transcriptome sequencing to reveal the effects of applied biochar on tobacco development before and after topping. Our results showed that topping affected carbon and nitrogen , photosynthesis and secondary  in the tobacco plants, while straw biochar-application to the soil resulted in amino  and lipid synthesis; additionally, it affected secondary  of the tobacco plants through carbon restoration and hormonal action, before and after topping. In addition to the new insights into the impact of biochar on crops, our findings provide a basis for biochar application measures in tobacco and other crops.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665679>Probing the hepatotoxicity mechanisms of novel chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl sulfonates to zebrafish larvae: Implication of structural specificity.</a></h1><p>Hepatotoxicity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae elicited by legacy perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and its three novel chlorinated alternatives, including chlorinated polyfluorooctane sulfonate (Cl-PFOS) and chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonates (6:2 and 8:2 Cl-PFESA analogs), was evaluated in this study. Upon 7-day separate exposure to the four target compounds at 1 µmol/L, significant hepatic steatosis in exposed larvae was evidenced by pathological micro/macro vacuolation, which was presumably attributed to the excess accumulation of lipid, especially the overloaded triglyceride (TG) level. Disruption on gene transcription was subjected to a structure-dependent manner. In general, PFOS, Cl-PFOS and 6:2 Cl-PFESA of the identical carbon chain length (i.e. C8), despite with different substituents, displayed a similar activation mode and comparable disruptive potency on lipid  responsive genes, which particularly promoted fatty  synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase, acacb) and β-oxidation (cytochrome P450 enzymes-1A, cyp1a; peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase 1, acox1; and acyl-CoA dehy-drogenase, acadm). However, 8:2 Cl-PFESA with a prolonged carbon chain length (i.e. C10), preferentially disturbed fatty  exportation (apolipoprotein-B100, apob) and triggered a different modulation pattern on fatty  β-oxidation against the other three compounds. Molecular docking analysis indicated that 8:2 Cl-PFESA exhibited considerably higher peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) antagonism than others, corresponding to its unique suppression effect on fatty  β-oxidation responsive genes. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo study reporting hepatotoxicity of Cl-PFOS and Cl-PFESAs to aquatic organisms. Although characterized with different toxic mode-of-action, these novel alternatives can elicit hepatic steatosis as strong as PFOS, stressing the biological risks in view of their global contamination.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Lack of a good mammalian model has impeded studies of pathogenesis and development of rational therapeutics. We took a new approach to investigating an existing mouse mutant of Pank2 and found that isolating the disease-vulnerable brain revealed regional perturbations in CoA , iron homeostasis, and dopamine  and functional defects in complex I and pyruvate dehydrogenase. Feeding mice a CoA pathway intermediate, 4'-phosphopantetheine, normalized levels of the CoA-, iron-, and dopamine-related biomarkers as well as activities of mitochondrial enzymes. Human cell changes also were recovered by 4'-phosphopantetheine. We can mechanistically link a defect in CoA  to these secondary effects via the activation of mitochondrial acyl carrier protein, which is essential to oxidative phosphorylation, iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis, and mitochondrial fatty  synthesis. We demonstrate the fidelity of our model in recapitulating features of the human disease. Moreover, we identify pharmacodynamic biomarkers, provide insights into disease pathogenesis, and offer evidence for 4'-phosphopantetheine as a candidate therapeutic for PKAN.© 2019 The Authors.

We hypothesized that total fermentation but not the source (type) of FM would be the main factor in determining cellular /molecular outcomes in the healthy colon epithelia. The main aim of this study was to elucidate the role of two different sources of FM, fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and wheat bran (WB), on the expression of genes involved in short chain fatty  (SCFA) transport, G-protein signaling, apoptosis, cell proliferation and oncogenesis in colon epithelia of healthy rats. Male Fischer 344 rats (n = 10/group) were fed AIN-93G control (0% FM) or experimental diets containing WB (~1%, 2%, or 5% FM) or FOS (~2%, 5%, or 8% FM). Rats were killed after 6 weeks and the colon mucosa was assessed for the expression of target genes using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. By comparison to the control, dose-related changes of mRNA levels were found in rats fed FOS-based diets, including: (a) upregulation of three SCFA transporters (Smct2, Mct1 and Mct4) but downregulation of Mct2, (b) upregulation of Gpr109a and downregulation of Gpr120, Gpr43, Gprc5a, Rgs2 and Rgs16, (c) upregulation of apoptosis-related genes including Bcl2, Bcl2-like 1, Bak1, Caspase 3, Caspase 8 and Caspase 9, (d) downregulation of the oncogenes and metastasis genes Ros1, Fos, Cd44, Fn1 and Plau, and (e) downregulation of several genes involved in cellular proliferation including Hbegf, Hoxb13, Cgref1, Wfdc1, Tgm3, Fgf7, Nov and Lumican. In contrast, rats fed WB-based diets resulted in dose-related upregulation of mRNA levels of Smct2, Rgs16, Gprc5a, Gpr109a, Bcl2-like 1, Caspase 8, and Fos. Additionally, different gene expression responses were observed in rats fed FOS and WB at 2% and 5% FM. Over all, these gene changes elicited by FOS and WB were independent of the expression of the tumor suppressor Tp53. These results suggest that fermentation alone is not the sole determinant of gene responses in the healthy rat colon.Crown Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We investigated the relationship of circulating palmitoleate with insulin sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in humans.Plasma NEFA concentration and composition were determined in non-diabetic individuals from the Relationship between Insulin Sensitivity and Cardiovascular disease (RISC) study cohort at baseline (n = 1234) and after a 3 year follow-up (n = 924). Glucose tolerance, insulin secretion and beta cell function were assessed during an OGTT. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was measured by a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (M/I) and OGTT (oral glucose insulin sensitivity index [OGIS]). The liver insulin resistance index was calculated using clinical and biochemical data. Body composition including fat mass was determined by bioelectrical impedance.Circulating palmitoleate was proportional to fat mass (r = 0.21, p < 0.0001) and total NEFA levels (r = 0.19, p < 0.0001). It correlated with whole-body insulin sensitivity (M/I: standardised regression coefficient [std. β] = 0.16, p < 0.0001), liver insulin resistance (std. β = -0.14, p < 0.0001), beta cell function (potentiation: std. β = 0.08, p = 0.045) and glucose tolerance (2 h glucose: std. β = -0.24, p < 0.0001) after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, adiposity and other NEFA. High palmitoleate concentrations prevented the decrease in insulin sensitivity associated with excess palmitate (p = 0.0001). In a longitudinal analysis, a positive independent relationship was observed between changes in palmitoleate and insulin sensitivity over time (std. β = 0.07, p = 0.04).We demonstrated that plasma palmitoleate is an independent determinant of insulin sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in non-diabetic individuals. These results support the role of palmitoleate as a beneficial lipokine released by adipose tissue to prevent the negative effects of adiposity and excess NEFA on systemic glucose .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680959>H NMR-Based Metabolomics Reveals the Antitumor Mechanisms of Triptolide in BALB/c Mice Bearing CT26 Tumors.</a></h1><p>Triptolide, the main active ingredient in  , has shown promising effects against a variety of tumors. However, the molecular pharmacological mechanisms explaining the action of triptolide remain unknown. In this study, the CT26 colon tumor cell line was inoculated subcutaneously into BALB/c mice, and plasma samples were subjected to H NMR metabolomics analysis. The  signature identified five metabolites whose levels were lower and 15 whose levels were higher in CT26 tumor-bearing mice than in normal control mice. Triptolide treatment significantly reversed the levels of nine of these metabolites, including isoleucine, glutamine, methionine, proline, 3-hydroxybutyric , 2-hydroxyisovalerate, 2-hydroxyisobutyrate, and low-density lipoprotein/very low-density lipoprotein.

(Mart.) O. Berg (Myrtaceae) leaves have been used to decrease cholesterol levels. However, studies to determine activities of this plant on triglycerides  have received little attention. The aim of this study was to examine anti-hyperlipidemic effects of a  aqueous leaf extract (CxAE) and assess protective actions against oxidative stress and DNA damage. The tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemia model was used in Wistar rats. Rats were treated orally with CxAE either 250 or 500 mg/kg/day for 7 days prior to tyloxapol administration. Biochemical parameters, oxidative stress levels, and genomic instability were assessed in several tissues. CxAE decreased cholesterol and triglyceride levels in serum and hepatic and renal DNA damage in tyloxapol-treated rats. There was no marked effect on the micronucleus frequency in bone marrow. The extract increased catalase activity and decreased glutathione S-transferase activity in kidney tissue. CxAE showed anti-hyperlipidemic effects, improved oxidative parameters, and protected DNA against damage induced by tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemia, suggesting  leaves may be useful in preventing dyslipidemias.

The altered energy  not only provides cancer cell with ATP for cellular energy, but also generate essential  intermediates that play a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of macromolecules, to support cell proliferation, invasiveness, and chemoresistance. The cellular  reprogramming in cancer is regulated by several oncogenic proteins and tumor suppressors such as hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1), Myc, p53, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of aerobic glycolysis can help in developing glycolytic inhibitors as anticancer agents. These  antiglycolytic agents could be more effective if used in drug combinations to combat cancer. Several preclinical and early clinical studies have shown the effectiveness of targeting the glycolytic pathway as a therapeutic approach to suppress cancer progression. This review aimed to present the most recent data on the emerging drug candidate targeting enzymes and intermediates involved in glucose  to provide therapeutic opportunities and challenges for antiglycolytic cancer therapy.Copyright © 2019.

Human MD2, an indispensable accessory protein in TLR4 signaling pathway, specifically recognizes lipopolysaccharides (LPS), thereby leading to the activation of TLR4 signaling pathway to produce many effectors that participate in inflammatory and immune responses against Gram-negative bacteria. Toll and immune deficiency (IMD)  are first characterized in Drosophila and are reportedly present in crustaceans, but the recognition and activation mechanism of these signaling  in crustaceans remains unclear. In the present study, a novel ML protein was characterized in mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) and designated as SpMD2. The complete SpMD2 cDNA sequence is 1114 bp long with a 465 bp open reading frame; it encodes a protein that contains 154 amino  (aa). In the deduced protein, a signal peptide (1-21 aa residues) and a ML domain (43-151 aa residues) were predicted. SpMD2 shared a similar three-dimensional structure and a close evolutionary relationship with human MD2. SpMD2 was highly expressed in gills, hemocytes, intestine, and hepatopancreas and was upregulated in gills and hemocytes after challenges with bacteria, thereby suggesting its involvement in antibacterial defense. Western blot assay showed that SpMD2 possesses strong binding activities to different bacteria and two fungi. ELISA demonstrated that SpMD2 exhibits binding abilities to LPS, lipid A, peptidoglycan (PGN), and lipoteichoic  (LTA). Its binding ability to LPS and lipid A were stronger than to PGN or LTA, implying that SpMD2 was an important LPS-binding protein in mud crab. Bacterial clearance assay revealed that the pre-incubation of Vibrio parahemolyticus with SpMD2 facilitates bacterial clearance in vivo and that knockdown of SpMD2 dramatically suppresses the bacterial clearance and decreases the expression of several antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Furthermore, SpMD2 overexpression could enhance the promoter activity of SpALF2. These results revealed that SpMD2 affects bacterial clearance by regulating AMPs. Thus, by binding to LPS and by regulating AMPs, SpMD2 may function as a potential receptor, which is involved in the recognition and activation of a certain immune signaling pathway against Gram-negative bacteria. This study provides new insights into the diverse functions of ML proteins and into the antibacterial mechanisms of crustaceans.Copyright © 2019.

IGFs take part in the embryonal development and postnatal growth, in interaction with the growth hormone (GH). The physiological effects of IGF1 are promotion of tissue growth and development, stimulation of cell proliferation, effects on lipid and carbohydrate , anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, anabolic, anti-oxidant, neuro- and hepatoprotective properties. Our knowledge about the GH/IGF axis is diverse, partly contradictory, their research is continued intensively nowadays. We considered it worthwhile to review and interpret this information. Study on GH/IGF medical reports, with particular reference to the less known  control. 75% of the growth factors are produced in the liver by GH and insulin stimulation; their effects are expressed on specific receptors, and modified by specific binding proteins. IGF1 directly increases the muscle mass, bone density, and the structure of the bones. Intestinal microbiota induces secretion of IGF1, which promotes the development and remodeling of the bones. Short-chain fatty , produced in microbial fermented fibers, induce secretion of IGF1, suggesting that microbial activity also affects bone health  IGF1. IGF1 also has a direct and indirect glucose-lowering effect, enhances free fatty  oxidation in the muscle, reducing the flow of free fatty  into the liver, improving insulin signaling, resulting in the reduction of hepatic glucose output, and improves insulin sensitivity. IGF1 directly influences the expression of circadian BMAL1 in hypothalamic cells: this refers to the newly recognized 'zeitgeber' role of IGF1. The bioactivity of insulin-like peptides in the brain is characterized by neuronal survival, excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, maintenance of normal free fatty  levels, improvement of cognitive function, protection against cell damage, neurogenesis and angiogenesis. The effects of IGF2 are less outlined, however, it has a relevant role in the development of the fetus, and acts protectively on the brain. Lack or over-expression of IGF1 can be detected or may causally associated in many pathological conditions. According to these collected data, insulin sensitivity may be improved by different .

Exogenous administration of both taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs have also been implicated in the modulation of cardiovascular functions. This brief review summarizes the role of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs in vascular relaxation through the modulation of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO). The effects of taurine on vascular health are controversial. However, in the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors, it has been proposed that taurine can increase vascular NO levels by increasing eNOS expression, eNOS phosphorylation on Ser1177, NO bioavailability, the level of antioxidative defense, and the l-arginine/NOS inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) ratio. The taurine-conjugated BA-mediated activation of Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), G protein-coupled BA receptor (TGR5) and/or muscarinic 3 receptor (M3) was also reported to increase vascular NO production. FXR activation increases eNOS expression and may reduce ADMA formation, while TGR5 increases mobilization of Ca and phosphorylation of eNOS and Akt in endothelial cells. Furthermore, taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs might regulate NO synthesis and activity by enhancing HS generation. Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of both taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs in reversing the endothelial dysfunction associated with diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension, obesity, malnutrition, and smoking. In addition, taurine-conjugated BAs have emerged as a potential treatment for portal hypertension. Despite these favorable findings, there is a need to further explore the mechanisms and signaling  underlying the endothelial effects of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs.

The clock-driven cellular oscillations are highly tissue specific to efficiently fine-tune local signaling, manage energy use and segregate incompatible processes. In most peripheral tissues, food acts as the main cue that entrains the oscillations to external time. Food intake and energy balance are under control of endocannabinoid (EC) signaling. Despite this obvious link between the circadian and EC systems, evidence for their interaction started to emerge only recently. We used targeted lipidomics to analyze circadian variations in EC tone in rat plasma, liver and adrenal tissue. The results provide the evidence that ECs, monoacylglycerols, N-acylethanolamines and their precursors oscillate with a tissue-specific circadian phase in plasma and liver. We then identified a set of rhythmically expressed genes likely responsible for the variations in EC tissue tone. In contrast to the liver, EC levels did not oscillate in the adrenal glands. Instead, we revealed that local EC receptor genes are under circadian regulation. To explore the impact of  signals on expression of these genes, we used daytime-restricted feeding schedule. We subsequently showed that daytime feeding strongly suppressed liver-expressed fatty  binding protein 5 (Fabp5) and adrenal-expressed non-canonical endocannabinoid receptors Gpr55 and Trpv1, whereas it upregulated liver-expressed Trpv1 and glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 1 (Gde1).

The physiological basis of molybdenum phytotoxicity is poorly understood. Plants take up molybdenum as molybdate, which is a structural analogue of sulfate. Therefore, it is presumed that elevated molybdate concentrations may hamper the uptake and subsequent  of sulfate, which may induce sulfur deficiency. In the current research, Chinese cabbage (Brassica pekinensis) seedlings were exposed to 50, 100, 150 and 200 μM Na MoO for nine days. Leaf chlorosis and a decreased plant growth occurred at concentrations ≥ 100 μM. Root growth was more affected than shoot growth. At ≥ 100 μM Na MoO , the sulfate uptake rate and capacity were increased, though only when expressed on a root fresh weight basis. When expressed on a whole plant fresh weight basis, which corrects for the impact of molybdate on the shoot-to-root ratio, the sulfate uptake rate and capacity remained unaffected. Molybdate concentrations ≥ 100 μM altered the mineral nutrient composition of plant tissues, although the levels of sulfur metabolites (sulfate, water-soluble non-protein thiols and total sulfur) were not altered. Moreover, the levels of nitrogen metabolites (nitrate, amino , proteins and total nitrogen), which are generally strongly affected by sulfate deprivation, were not affected. The root water-soluble non-protein thiol content was increased and the tissue nitrate levels decreased, only at 200 μM Na MoO . Evidently, molybdenum toxicity in Chinese cabbage was not due to the direct interference of molybdate with the uptake and subsequent  of sulfate.© 2019 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665663>Differential protein analysis of Heracleum moellendorffii Hance seeds during stratification.</a></h1><p>Heracleum moellendorffii Hance is a medicinal vegetable species, and the seed dormancy of this species has caused many agricultural problems. One stratification technique involves alternating layers of seeds and substrate to allow post-ripening of dormant seeds under appropriate environmental conditions and to release dormancy. Non-stratified seeds (NS), cotyledon-stage-embryo seeds (CS) and germinated seeds (GS) represent key stages of H. moellendorffii seeds during stratification. To better understand the breaking of dormancy caused by stratification, tandem mass tag (TMT) mass spectrometry (MS)/MS was used to detect proteins among NS, CS and GS. A total of 876 proteins were identified, which were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. The results showed that carbohydrate  processes, responses to stress and ribosome biogenesis were the main biological processes. The changes in protein accumulation were validated by qRT-PCR. The results showed that starch, sucrose, pyruvate and fatty   played significant roles and that the contents of stored substances were gradually degraded during stratification.

In recent years, ITC has emerged as a powerful tool to characterise enzyme kinetics. In this study, we have adapted a single-injection method (SIM) to study the kinetics of human soluble epoxide hydrolase (hsEH), an enzyme involved in cardiovascular homeostasis, hypertension, nociception and insulin sensitivity through the  of epoxy-fatty  (EpFAs). In the SIM method, the rate of reaction is determined by monitoring the thermal power while the substrate is being depleted, overcoming the need for synthetic substrates, and reducing postreaction processing. Our results show that ITC enables the detailed, rapid and reproducible characterisation of the hsEH-mediated hydrolysis of several natural EpFA substrates. Furthermore, we have applied a variant of the single-injection ITC method for the detailed description of enzyme inhibition, proving the power of this approach in the rapid screening and discovery of new hsEH inhibitors using the enzyme's physiological substrates. The methods described herein will enable further studies on EpFAs  and biology, as well as drug discovery investigations to identify and characterise hsEH inhibitors. This also promises to provide a general approach for the characterisation of lipid catalysis, given the challenges that lipid  studies pose to traditional spectroscopic techniques.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672445>SIRT1 activation rescues the mislocalization of RNA-binding proteins and cognitive defects induced by inherited cobalamin disorders.</a></h1><p>The molecular consequences of inborn errors of vitamin B12 or cobalamin  are far from being understood. Moreover, innovative therapeutic strategies are needed for the treatment of neurological outcomes that are usually resistant to conventional treatments. Our previous findings suggest a link between SIRT1, cellular stress and RNA binding proteins (RBP) mislocalization in the pathological mechanisms triggered by impaired vitamin B12 .The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of the pharmacological activation of SIRT1 using SRT1720 on the molecular mechanisms triggered by impaired methionine synthase activity. Experiments were performed in vitro with fibroblasts from patients with the cblG and cblC inherited defects of vitamin B12  and in vivo with an original transgenic mouse model of methionine synthase deficiency specific to neuronal cells. Subcellular localization of the RBPs HuR, HnRNPA1, RBM10, SRSF1 and Y14 was investigated by immunostaining and confocal microscopy in patient fibroblasts. RBPs methylation and phosphorylation were studied by co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay. Cognitive performance of the transgenic mice treated with SRT1720 was measured with an aquatic maze.Patient fibroblasts with cblC and cblG defects of vitamin B12  presented with endoplasmic reticulum stress, altered methylation, phosphorylation and subcellular localization of HuR, HnRNPA1 and RBM10, global mRNA mislocalization and increased HnRNPA1-dependent skipping of IRF3 exons. Incubation of fibroblasts with cobalamin, S-adenosyl methionine and okadaic  rescued the localization of the RBPs and mRNA. The SIRT1 activating compound SRT1720 inhibited ER stress and rescued RBP and mRNA mislocalization and IRF3 splicing. Treatment with this SIRT1 agonist prevented all these hallmarks in patient fibroblasts but it also improved the deficient hippocampo-dependent learning ability of methionine synthase conditional knock-out mice.By unraveling the molecular mechanisms triggered by inborn errors of cbl  associating ER stress, RBP mislocalization and mRNA trafficking, our study opens novel therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of inborn errors of vitamin B12 .Copyright © 2019.

In biology, epimerization is an important way to generate steric diversity. MarH catalyzes the epimerization of the β-position of (3R)-β-methyl-indolepyruvate (MeInPy), forming (3S)-β-MeInPy. Both compounds are derivatives of l-tryptophan (l-Trp) and are important precursors of bioactive natural products. Here, we report the crystal structures of MarH and the NMR structure of its complex with l-Trp, an analogue of its native substrate, (3R)-β-MeInPy. Structural analysis and mutagenesis studies indicated that His25 acts as a base to remove Hβ and generate a planar carbanion intermediate, which is then putatively reprotonated on the opposite face by a water molecule to form (3S)-β-MeInPy in a stereospecific manner. The details of β-site isomerization at the atomic level provide deeper insights into the epimerization mechanism of MarH and will facilitate further enzyme design to extend the substrate scope.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670086>New insights of the bacterial response to exposure of differently sized silver nanomaterials.</a></h1><p>The release of silver nanomaterials (AgNMs) from extensive use poses potential risks to human health and ecological environments. Although previous studies have reported the negative effects of AgNMs on various microorganisms, little is known about the response of bacteria under the exposure of AgNMs at the cellular level. Here, we report the multiple responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 (PAO1) under the exposure of two types of AgNMs, including spherical silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and fibrous silver nanorods (AgNRs), by physiological experiments, microscopy, synchrotron-based X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS), flow cytometry and genome-wide RNA sequencing. Our results demonstrated that the exposure to both types of AgNMs could inhibit the growth of PAO1, accompanied by the overproduction of oxidative stress and inducing cell membrane damage. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the roughened cell membrane under both AgNMs treatment. In addition, both AgNMs repressed the expression of quorum sensing and metal efflux-related genes in PAO1, but stimulated denitrification, glycerol and amino  metabolisms, SOS response and pyocin overproduction of PAO1. Compared to AgNRs, AgNPs exposure showed a much lower threshold concentration to trigger the inhibitory effect and induced greater transcriptional responses of PAO1. This study suggested that AgNMs could cause multiple effects on the proliferation, , virulence and pathogenesis of PAO1, which might further affect the corresponding environmental microbial communities. Overall, our findings offer insights into the interactions between AgNMs and bacteria at the molecular level.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The role of this  pathway in macrophage response and function is unknown. We show that the enzyme cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) is induced in macrophages infected with pathogenic bacteria through signaling involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/MTOR and the transcription factor SP1. This results in the synthesis of cystathionine, which facilitates the survival of pathogens within myeloid cells. Our data demonstrate that the expression of CTH leads to defective macrophage activation by (i) dysregulation of polyamine  by depletion of -adenosylmethionine, resulting in immunosuppressive putrescine accumulation and inhibition of spermidine and spermine synthesis, and (ii) increased histone H3K9, H3K27, and H3K36 di/trimethylation, which is associated with gene expression silencing. Thus, CTH is a pivotal enzyme of the innate immune response that disrupts host defense. The induction of the reverse transsulfuration pathway by bacterial pathogens can be considered an unrecognized mechanism for immune escape. Macrophages are professional immune cells that ingest and kill microbes. In this study, we show that different pathogenic bacteria induce the expression of cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) in macrophages. This enzyme is involved in a  pathway called the reverse transsulfuration pathway, which leads to the production of numerous metabolites, including cystathionine. Phagocytized bacteria use cystathionine to better survive in macrophages. In addition, the induction of CTH results in dysregulation of the  of polyamines, which in turn dampens the proinflammatory response of macrophages. In conclusion, pathogenic bacteria can evade the host immune response by inducing CTH in macrophages.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663987>Plasma levels of miR-30d-5p are decreased in regularly exercising postmenopausal women.</a></h1><p>Plasma/serum microRNAs (miRNAs) are proposed to have a role in the development of osteoporosis, and their levels can be affected by physical activity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze differences in plasma miRNAs levels in postmenopausal women and to simultaneously find novel extracellular miRNAs that are associated with variations in physical activities.We measured hsa-miR-148a-3p, hsa-miR-125b, hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-93-5p, and hsa-miR-30d-5p in a cohort of 149 postmenopausal women divided into subgroups based on the amount of physical activity by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Further, the correlation of plasma microRNAs with sit-to-stand performance was examined. DIANA web server was used to find which Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes  (P < 0.05) were regulated by miRNAs associated with physical activity and sit-to-stand performance.Plasma levels of hsa-miR-30d-5p were significantly (P = 0.015) lower in participants with higher physical activity, and a borderline trend for hsa-miR-21-5p (P = 0.06) was noticed. Higher plasma levels of hsa-miR-21-5p (P = 0.01) and hsa-miR-93-5p (P = 0.04) were observed in the group with reduced sit-to-stand performance. The two miRNAs seem to primarily regulate fatty  -related processes.Our results suggest that levels of selected cell-free miRNAs in postmenopausal women are associated with different physical activity regimes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682760>Predictive Metabolomic Signatures for Safety Assessment of Metal Oxide Nanoparticles.</a></h1><p>The widespread use of metal oxide nanoparticles (MOx NPs) poses a risk of exposure that may lead to adverse health effects on humans. Even though a number of toxicological methodologies are available for assessing nanotoxicity, the effect of MOx NPs on cell  in vitro and in vivo remains largely unknown, especially under the exposure to low-dose or supposedly low-toxicity MOx NPs. In this study, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based metabolomics was used to reveal significantly altered metabolites and   in human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to four different types of MOx NPs (ZnO, SiO2, TiO2 and CeO2) at both high (25 µg/mL) and low (12.5 µg/mL) doses. We demonstrated that high-dose ZnO NPs caused severe cytotoxicity with altered  of amino , nucleotides, nucleosides, tricarboxylic  cycle, lipids, inflammation/redox, and fatty  oxidation, as well as the elevation of toxic and DNA damage related metabolites. Fewer metabolomic alterations were induced by low dose ZnO NPs. However, most metabolites significantly altered by high dose ZnO NPs were also slightly changed by low dose ZnO NPs. On the other hand, the cells exposed to SiO2, TiO2 and CeO2 NPs at either high or low dose displayed low cytotoxicity with similar metabolomic alterations, although each type of NPs induced distinct changes of certain metabolites. These three NPs significantly affected the   of sphingosine-1-phosphate, fatty  oxidation, folate cycle, inflammation/redox, and lipid . In addition, dose-dependent effects were observed for a number of metabolites significantly altered by respective MOx NPs. Representative metabolites of the significantly altered   were successfully validated in vitro using enzymatic assays. More importantly, these representative metabolites were further validated in a mouse model after lung exposure to respective NPs, indicating that in vitro metabolomic findings may be used to effectively predict the toxicological effects in vivo. Despite functional assay results demonstrated that the changes in cellular functions were largely reflected by the metabolomic alterations, LC-MS based metabolomics was sensitive enough to detect the subtle metabolomic changes when functional cellular assays showed no significant difference. Collectively, our studies have unveiled potential  mechanisms of MOx NPs-induced nanotoxicity in lung epithelial cells and demonstrated the sensitivity and feasibility of using metabolomic signatures to understand and predict nanotoxicity in vivo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668391>miR-873-5p targets mitochondrial GNMT-Complex II interface contributing to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a complex pathology in which several dysfunctions, including alterations in  , mitochondrial functionality and unbalanced lipid import/export, lead to lipid accumulation and progression to inflammation and fibrosis. The enzyme glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), the most important enzyme implicated in S-adenosylmethionine catabolism in the liver, is downregulated during NAFLD progression. We have studied the mechanism involved in GNMT downregulation by its repressor microRNA miR-873-5p and the   affected in NAFLD as well as the benefit of recovery GNMT expression.miR-873-5p and GNMT expression were evaluated in liver biopsies of NAFLD/NASH patients. Different in vitro and in vivo NAFLD murine models were used to assess miR-873-5p/GNMT involvement in fatty liver progression through targeting of the miR-873-5p as NAFLD therapy.We describe a new function of GNMT as an essential regulator of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain in the mitochondria. In NAFLD, GNMT expression is controlled by miR-873-5p in the hepatocytes, leading to disruptions in mitochondrial functionality in a preclinical murine non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model. Upregulation of miR-873-5p is shown in the liver of NAFLD/NASH patients, correlating with hepatic GNMT depletion. Importantly, NASH therapies based on anti-miR-873-5p resolve lipid accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis by enhancing fatty  β-oxidation in the mitochondria. Therefore, miR-873-5p inhibitor emerges as a potential tool for NASH treatment.GNMT participates in the regulation of   and mitochondrial functionality through the regulation of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain. In NAFLD, GNMT is repressed by miR-873-5p and its targeting arises as a valuable therapeutic option for treatment.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

In this study, we used hydrogen peroxide (HO)-induced injury in human hepatic L02 cells to investigate the mechanisms involved in the hepatoprotective activity of γ-oryzanol. The injuries produced by HO in L02 cells include increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreased activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), increased protein expressions of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and induced apoptosis. Pretreatment with γ-oryzanol enhanced the ROS scavenging activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes and decreased lipid peroxidation in HO treated cells. Moreover, pretreatment with γ-oryzanol inhibited HO-induced apoptosis by restoring MMP, upregulating the expression ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, and inhibiting the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. These findings show that γ-oryzanol can prevent HO-induced apoptosis by suppressing intracellular accumulation of ROS and impeding ROS-activated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

This trend is driven largely by the recent surge in incidence of  syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Given the central role of the liver in lipid homeostasis, altered hepatic lipid  has been identified as a contributing factor to hepatocellular carcinoma. Neoplastic cells are highly dependent on lipid  as a source of energy and to support rapid cell division, and fatty  derivatives play key roles in cell signaling. Aberrant expression of liver fatty –binding protein and changes in the ratio of saturated to unsaturated triacylglycerols have been shown to be associated with disease severity and subtype. This chapter focuses on  reprogramming and dysregulation of lipid  as hallmarks of hepatocellular carcinoma.Copyright: The Authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670119>Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses reveal antibacterial mechanism of astringent persimmon tannin against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated from pork.</a></h1><p>Persimmon tannin (PT) exhibits antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated from retail pork.

Accumulating evidence have suggested microgravity and simulated weightlessness could induce dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota, which may contribute to the bowel symptoms during spaceflight. However, the specific responses of intestinal metabolome under simulated weightlessness and its relationship with the intestinal microbiome and immune characteristics remain largely unknown. In the current study, 20 adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into the control group and the simulated weightlessness group using a hindlimb unloading model. The metabolomic profiling of cecal contents from eight rats of each group was investigated by gas chromatography-time of flight/mass spectrometry. The significantly different metabolites, biomarkers, and related  were identified. Multivariate analysis, such as principal component analysis and orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis, demonstrated an obvious separation between the control group and the simulated weightlessness group. Significantly different metabolites, such as xylose, sinapinic , indolelactate, and digalacturonic , were identified, which participate in mainly pyrimidine , pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and valine, leucine and isoleucine . Cytidine-5'-monophosphate, 4-hydroxypyridine, and phloretic  were determined as pivotal biomarkers under simulated weightlessness. Moreover, the significantly different metabolites were remarkably correlated with dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and disturbance of immunological characteristics induced by simulated weightlessness.

Recent findings in the field identified mechanistic details governing these  adaptations. However, it is unknown whether a switch to glycolysis from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is a general characteristic of DCs upon pathogen encounter. Here we show that engagement of different TLR triggers differential  adaptations in DCs. We demonstrate that LPS-mediated TLR4 stimulation induces glycolysis in DCs. Conversely, activation of TLR7/8 with protamine-RNA complex, pRNA, leads to an increase in OXPHOS. Mechanistically, we found that pRNA stimulation phosphorylates BCKDE1α in a PINK1-dependent manner. pRNA stimulation increased branched-chain amino  levels and increased fatty  oxidation. Increased FAO and OXPHOS are required for DC activation. PINK1 deficient DCs switch to glycolysis to maintain ATP levels and viability. Moreover, pharmacological induction of PINK1 kinase activity primed immunosuppressive DC for immunostimulatory function.

ROS are chemically similar to reactive sulfur species (RSS) and signal through identical mechanisms. Here we examined the effects of LA on RSS in HEK293 cells using HS and polysulfide (PS) specific fluorophores, AzMC and SSP4. We show that LA concentration-dependently increased both HS and PS. Physioxia (5% O) augmented the effects of LA on HS production but decreased PS production. Thiosulfate, a known substrate for reduced LA, and an intermediate in the catabolism of HS enhanced the effects of LA on HS and PS production. Inhibiting peroxiredoxins with conoidin A and gluraredoxins with tiopronin augmented the effects of LA on PS and HS, respectively while decreasing glutathione with buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO) or diethyl maleate (DEM) decreased the stimulatory effect of LA on HS production but augmented LA's effect on PS. Aminooxyacetate (AOA) and propargylglycine (PPG), inhibitors of HS production from cysteine partially inhibited LA augmentation of HS production and further decreased the LA effect when applied concurrently with BSO and DEM. The selective and cell-permeable HS scavenger, SS20, inhibited the effects of LA on cellular HS. Estimates of single-cell HS production suggest that 0.1-0.2% of O consumption is used to metabolize HS and these requirements may increase to 1-2% with 1 mM LA. Collectively, these results suggest that LA rescues HS from irreversible oxidation and that the effects of LA on RSS directly confer antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective responses. They also suggest that TS may be an effective supplement to increase the efficacy of LA in clinical settings.Copyright © 2019.

Over the last decade, many FET type biosensors based on various nanomaterials (e.g. silicon nanowires, graphene, and transition metal dichalcogenides) have been developed to detect various classes of biomolecular targets due to their integration into portable and rapid test systems, both for use in the clinical lab and in point-of-care testing. This review (with 197 refs.) starts with an introduction into the specific features of FET biosensor technology. This is followed by a description of the essentials of methods for immobilization of recognition elements. The next section discusses the progress that has been made in FET based biosensors using semiconducting nanostructures composed of silicon, graphene, metal oxides, and transition metal dichalcogenides. A further section is devoted to microfluidic systems combined with FET biosensors.

Neurotoxicity of dopaminergic neurons triggered by aggregation of misfolded α-synuclein is a major pathogenic trait of PD. However, growing evidence indicates that peripheral processes, including  changes, may precede and contribute to neurodegeneration. The present study was undertaken to identify a  signature of PD through the quantification of serum amino  and derivatives.Twenty older adults with PD (11 men and 9 women; mean age 73.1 ± 10.2 years) and 30 age-matched controls (14 men and 16 women; mean age 74.6 ± 4.3 years) were enrolled. A panel of 37 serum amino  and derivatives was assessed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Partial least squares - discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) followed by double cross-validation was used to characterize the relationship between amino  profiles and PD.The optimal complexity of the PLS-DA model was found to be three latent variables. The proportion of correct classifications was 99.3 ± 2.5% for participants with PD and 94.7 ± 3.0% for non-PD controls. Higher levels of β-amino butyric , cystine, ornithine, phosphoethanolamine, and proline defined the circulating amino  profile of older people with PD. Controls were characterized by higher concentrations of 3-methyl-histidine, citrulline, and serine.Our findings indicate the existence of a distinct metabotype in older persons with PD. Future studies will have to establish whether changes in amino   are involved in the pathogenesis of PD. This knowledge may be harnessed to identify novel disease biomarkers as well as new targets for interventions.Copyright © 2019.

Mutations in MFN2 cause the neurodegenerative disease Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2A (CMT2A). The molecular basis underlying the physiological and pathological relevance of MFN2 is unclear. Here, we present crystal structures of truncated human MFN2 in different nucleotide-loading states. Unlike other dynamin superfamily members including MFN1, MFN2 forms sustained dimers even after GTP hydrolysis via the GTPase domain (G) interface, which accounts for its high membrane-tethering efficiency. The biochemical discrepancy between human MFN2 and MFN1 largely derives from a primate-only single amino  variance. MFN2 and MFN1 can form heterodimers via the G interface in a nucleotide-dependent manner. CMT2A-related mutations, mapping to different functional zones of MFN2, lead to changes in GTP hydrolysis and homo/hetero-association ability. Our study provides fundamental insight into how mitofusins mediate mitochondrial fusion and the ways their disruptions cause disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676437>The lipoxygenase pathway of Tupaia belangeri representing Scandentia. Genomic multiplicity and functional characterization of the ALOX15 orthologs in the tree shrew.</a></h1><p>The tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri) is a rat-sized mammal, which is more closely related to humans than mice and rats. However, the use of tree shrew to explore the patho-mechanisms of human inflammatory disorders has been limited since nothing is known about eicosanoid  in this mammalian species. Eicosanoids are important lipid mediators exhibiting pro- and anti-inflammatory activities, which are biosynthesized via lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase . When we searched the tree shrew genome for the presence of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase isoforms we found copies of functional COX1, COX2 and LOX genes. Interestingly, we identified four copies of ALOX15 genes, which encode for four structurally distinct ALOX15 orthologs (tupALOX15a-d). To explore the catalytic properties of these enzymes we expressed tupALOX15a and tupALOX15c as catalytically active proteins and characterized their enzymatic properties. As predicted by the Evolutionary Hypothesis of ALOX15 specificity we found that the two enzymes converted arachidonic  predominantly to 12S-HETE and they also exhibited membrane oxygenase activities. However, their reaction kinetic properties (K for arachidonic  and oxygen, T- and pH-dependence) and their substrate specificities were remarkably different. In contrast to mice and humans, tree shrew ALOX15 isoforms are highly expressed in the brain suggesting a role of these enzymes in cerebral function. The genomic multiplicity and the tissue expression patterns of tree shrew ALOX15 isoforms need to be considered when the results of in vivo inflammation studies obtained in this animal are translated into the human situation.Copyright © 2019.

Following a systematic multi-omic study, 37 (cell culture) and 31 (serum) metabolites; 130 (cell culture) and 56 (serum) lipids; 9 (cell culture) and 13 (serum) proteins were seen to be differentially expressed (p<0.05), enabling discrimination between CRC and control. By using these enriched components, we demonstrated that the joint  mainly involving fatty  and amino   related  changed in CRC significantly. We conclude that this study increases our understanding of molecular basis of CRC, and provides potential exosomal biomarkers for the non-invasive detection, and discrimination of CRC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We report a new high-resolution system to measure the stable carbon isotopic composition of carboxyl atoms within amino . The automated system used HPLC to separate amino  followed by addition of ninhydrin for decarboxylation and transfer of the evolved CO2 to a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer for δ13CCARBOXYL measurement. The ninhydrin reaction was conducted at acidic pH (1.5) and elevated temperature (160 oC) giving yields close to 100% for most common amino . Eight mammalian keratin samples from herbivores (kudu and caribou), omnivores (humans) and carnivores (bowhead and humpback zooplanktivorous whales) were analysed with this new system. The data provide an initial calibration of reference materials to be used in studies of this type and is the first report of carboxyl carbon isotope distributions in mammals. Results showed widespread 13C enrichments in both essential and non-essential amino  carboxyl groups, likely linked to decarboxylation of amino  during normal . Analyses of non-essential amino  isotope profiles showed (1) consistent and general taxon-level  differences between the herbivore, human and whale samples, (2) marked differences among individual humans, ruminants and whales (3) evidence for gluconeogenesis in the wildlife samples, and (4) extensive 13C enrichment likely associated with fasting in the humpback whale sample. Future mammalian research related to the  of growth, reproduction, aging and disease may benefit from using this technique. Values obtained for internationally available samples USGS42 and USGS43 (Tibetan and Indian human hair) provide a first characterization of reference materials for δ13CCARBOXYL profiles.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659239>Uncarboxylated osteocalcin ameliorates hepatic glucose and lipid  in KKAy mice via activating insulin signaling pathway.</a></h1><p>Osteocalcin, expressed in osteoblasts of the bone marrow, undergoes post-translational carboxylation and deposits in mineralized bone matrix. A portion of osteocalcin remains uncarboxylated (uncarboxylated osteocalcin, GluOC) that is released into blood where it functions as a hormone to regulate insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. As insulin resistance is closely associated with  syndrome, this study is aimed to elucidate how GluOC regulates glucose and lipid  in KKAy mice, an animal model displaying obese, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. GluOC (3, 30 ng/g per day, ig) was orally administered to female KKAy mice for 4 weeks. Whole-body insulin sensitivity, glucose , hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia were examined using routine laboratory assays. We found that GluOC administration significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity in KKAy mice by activating hepatic IRβ/PI3K/Akt pathway and elevated the whole-body insulin sensitivity with decreased FPI and HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, GluOC administration alleviated hyperglycemia through suppressing gluconeogenesis and promoting glycogen synthesis in KKAy mice and in cultured hepatocytes in vitro. Moreover, GluOC administration dose-dependently ameliorated dyslipidemia and attenuated hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice by inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis and promoting fatty- β-oxidation. These results demonstrate that GluOC effectively enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity, improves hyperglycemia and ameliorates hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice, suggesting that GluOC could be a promising drug candidate for treating  syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664147>Leucine-rich diet induces a shift in tumour  from glycolytic towards oxidative phosphorylation, reducing glucose consumption and metastasis in Walker-256 tumour-bearing rats.</a></h1><p>Leucine can stimulate protein synthesis in skeletal muscle, and recent studies have shown an increase in leucine-related mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation capacity in muscle cells. However, leucine-related effects in tumour tissues are still poorly understood. Thus, we described the effects of leucine in both in vivo and in vitro models of a Walker-256 tumour. Tumour-bearing Wistar rats were randomly distributed into a control group (W; normoprotein diet) and leucine group (LW; leucine-rich diet [normoprotein + 3% leucine]). After 20 days of tumour evolution, the animals underwent -fludeoxyglucose positron emission computed tomography (F-FDG PET-CT) imaging, and after euthanasia, fresh tumour biopsy samples were taken for oxygen consumption rate measurements (Oroboros Oxygraph), electron microscopy analysis and RNA and protein extraction. Our main results from the LW group showed no tumour size change, lower tumour glucose (F-FDG) uptake, and reduced metastatic sites. Furthermore, leucine stimulated a shift in tumour  from glycolytic towards oxidative phosphorylation, higher mRNA and protein expression of oxidative phosphorylation components, and enhanced mitochondrial density/area even though the leucine-treated tumour had a higher number of apoptotic nuclei with increased oxidative stress. In summary, a leucine-rich diet directed Walker-256 tumour  to a less glycolytic phenotype profile in which these  alterations were associated with a decrease in tumour aggressiveness and reduction in the number of metastatic sites in rats fed a diet supplemented with this branched-chain amino .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659573>A transcriptomic study of selenium against liver injury induced by beta-cypermethrin in mice by RNA-seq.</a></h1><p>Evidence from biochemical liver function index and histopathology analysis suggested that selenium could effectively repair the liver injury caused by beta-cypermethrin (β-CYP). However, the molecular mechanism of selenium against liver injury induced by β-CYP remains unclear. In the present study, dynamic changes in gene expression profiles before and after the treatment of NaSeO in liver injury mice were analyzed by using RNA sequencing. As a result, several essential genes and  were identified to be significantly associated with this process. In particular, ten genes including Cyp2j11, Cyp2b10, Cyp3a13, Dhrs9, Socs2, Stat4, Gm13305, Cyp3a44, Retsat, and Cyp26b1 were significantly enriched in the functional categories related to retinol , linoleic  , and Jak-STAT signaling pathway. Among them, the expression patterns of nine genes were validated by qRT-PCR, except for Cyp3a44. Furthermore, we have constructed the associated regulatory network based on the identified targets revealed by high throughput screening. Our study may provide insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the protective effect of selenium against liver injury induced by β-CYP in mammals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657947>Media Optimization, Strain Compatibility, and Low-Shear Modeled Microgravity Exposure of Synthetic Microbial Communities for Urine Nitrification in Regenerative Life-Support Systems.</a></h1><p>Urine is a major waste product of human  and contains essential macro- and micronutrients to produce edible microorganisms and crops. Its biological conversion into a stable form can be obtained through urea hydrolysis, subsequent nitrification, and organics removal, to recover a nitrate-enriched stream, free of oxygen demand. In this study, the utilization of a microbial community for urine nitrification was optimized with the focus for space application. To assess the role of selected parameters that can impact ureolysis in urine, the activity of six ureolytic heterotrophs ( and ) was tested at different salinities, urea, and amino  concentrations. The interaction of the ureolytic heterotrophs with a nitrifying consortium ( ATCC 19718 and  ATCC 25931) was also tested. Lastly, microgravity was simulated in a clinostat utilizing hardware for in-flight experiments with active microbial cultures. The results indicate salt inhibition of the ureolysis at 30 mS cm, while amino  nitrogen inhibits ureolysis in a strain-dependent manner. The combination of the nitrifiers with  and  resulted in a complete halt of the urea hydrolysis process, while in the case of  incomplete nitrification was observed, and nitrite was not oxidized further to nitrate. Nitrate production was confirmed in all the other communities; however, the other heterotrophic strains most likely induced oxygen competition in the test setup, and nitrite accumulation was observed. Samples exposed to low-shear modeled microgravity through clinorotation behaved similarly to the static controls. Overall, nitrate production from urea was successfully demonstrated with synthetic microbial communities under terrestrial and simulated space gravity conditions, corroborating the application of this process in space.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680945>Salsolinol Attenuates Doxorubicin-Induced Chronic Heart Failure in Rats and Improves Mitochondrial Function in H9c2 Cardiomyocytes.</a></h1><p> Salsolinol (SAL), a plant-based isoquinoline alkaloid, was initially isolated from Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata (ALRP) and identified as the active cardiotonic component of ALRP. This study was aimed to explore the therapeutic effect and mechanism by which SAL attenuates doxorubicin (DOX)-induced chronic heart failure (CHF) in rats and improves mitochondrial function in H9c2 cardiomyocytes.  Rats were intraperitoneally injected with DOX to establish CHF model. Therapeutic effects of SAL on hemodynamic parameters, serum indices, and the histopathology of the heart were analyzed . Moreover, H9c2 cardiomyocytes were pretreated with SAL for 2 h before DOX treatment in all procedures . Cell viability, cardiomyocyte morphology, proliferation, and mitochondrial function were detected by a high-content screening (HCS) assay. In addition, a Seahorse Extracellular Flux (XFp) analyzer was used to evaluate the cell energy respiratory and energy  function. To further investigate the potential mechanism of SAL, relative mRNA and protein expression of key enzymes in the tricarboxylic  cycle  and mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) signaling pathway-related molecules  were detected.  The present data demonstrated the pharmacological effect of SAL on DOX-induced CHF, which was through ameliorating heart function, downregulating serum levels of myocardial injury markers, alleviating histological injury to the heart, increasing the relative mRNA expression levels of key enzymes downstream of the tricarboxylic  cycle , and thus enhancing myocardial energy . In addition, SAL had effects on increasing cell viability, ameliorating DOX-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, and increasing mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in H9c2 cardiomyocyte. Moreover, we found that SAL might have an effect on improving mitochondrial respiratory function and energy   inhibiting excessive activation of MCU pathway in H9c2 cells. However, the protective effect could be ameliorated by ruthenium red (an MCU inhibitor) and abrogated by spermine (an MCU activator) .  The therapeutic effects of SAL on CHF are possibly related to ameliorating cardiomyocyte function resulting in promotion of mitochondrial respiratory and energy . Furthermore, the potential mechanism might be related to downregulating MCU pathway. These findings may provide a potential therapy for CHF.Copyright © 2019 Wen, Zhang, Liu, Wang, Li, Yang, Wang, Cai, Li and Zhao.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677315>Metabolomics of Red Light-Induced Stomatal Opening in Arabidopsis thaliana: Coupling with Abscisic  and Jasmonic  .</a></h1><p>Environmental stimuli-triggered stomatal movement is a key physiological process that regulates CO uptake and water loss in plants. Stomata are defined by pairs of guard cells that perceive and transduce external signals, leading to cellular volume changes and consequent stomatal aperture change. Within the visible light spectrum, red light induces stomatal opening in intact leaves. However, there has been debate regarding the extent to which red light-induced stomatal opening arises from direct guard cell sensing of red light vs. indirect responses as a result of red light influences on mesophyll photosynthesis. Here we identify conditions that result in red light-stimulated stomatal opening in isolated epidermal peels and enlargement of protoplasts, firmly establishing a direct guard cell response to red light. We then employ metabolomics workflows utilizing gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for metabolite profiling and identification of Arabidopsis guard cell  signatures in response to red light in the absence of the mesophyll. We quantified 223 metabolites in Arabidopsis guard cells, with 104 found to be red light responsive. These red light-modulated metabolites participate in the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle, carbon balance, phytohormone biosynthesis, and redox homeostasis. We next analyzed selected Arabidopsis mutants and discovered that stomatal opening response to red light is correlated with a decrease in guard cell ABA content and an increase in JA content. The red light-modulated guard cell metabolome reported here provides fundamental information concerning autonomous red light signaling  in guard cells.© 2019 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681440>Profiling Transcriptional Regulation and Functional Roles of  c-Jun N-Terminal Kinase.</a></h1><p>Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play a regulatory role and influence various biological activities, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Our group has demonstrated through functional studies that  c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SmJNK) MAPK is involved in the parasite's development, reproduction, and survival. SmJNK can, therefore, be considered a potential target for the development of new drugs. Considering the importance of SmJNK in  maturation, we aimed at understanding of SmJNK regulated signaling  in the parasite, correlating expression data with  development. To better understand the role of SmJNK in  intravertebrate host life stages, RNA interference knockdown was performed in adult worms and in schistosomula larval stage. SmJNK knocked-down in adult worms showed a decrease in oviposition and no significant alteration in their movement. RNASeq libraries of SmJNK knockdown schistosomula were sequenced. A total of 495 differentially expressed genes were observed in the SmJNK knockdown parasites, of which 373 were down-regulated and 122 up-regulated. Among the down-regulated genes, we found transcripts related to protein folding, purine nucleotide , the structural composition of ribosomes and cytoskeleton. Genes coding for proteins that bind to nucleic  and proteins involved in the phagosome and spliceosome  were enriched. Additionally, we found that SmJNK and Smp38 MAPK signaling  converge regulating the expression of a large set of genes.  orthologous genes were enriched for genes related to sterility and oocyte maturation, corroborating the observed phenotype alteration. This work allowed an in-depth analysis of the SmJNK signaling pathway, elucidating gene targets of regulation and functional roles of this critical kinase for parasite maturation.Copyright © 2019 Gava, Tavares, Falcone, Oliveira and Mourão.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668396>PAR2 controls cholesterol homeostasis and lipid  in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h1><p>Increases in hepatic and plasma cholesterol occur in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), although the reason for this is not well understood. We investigated whether Protease-Activated Receptor 2 (PAR2) plays a role in cholesterol and lipid homeostasis in NAFLD.Human liver biopsies (n = 108) were quantified for PAR2 expression from NAFLD cases randomly selected and stratified by liver fibrosis stage, the primary predictor for clinical outcomes, while controlling for age, gender, and BMI between fibrosis groups. Demographic data and laboratory studies on plasma samples were obtained within 6 months of liver biopsy. Wild-type and PAR2-KO (C57BL/6 F2rl1) mice were fed either normal or high fat diet for 16 weeks and plasma and liver assayed for lipids and soluble metabolites.Severity of NAFLD and plasma cholesterol levels significantly correlated with hepatocyte PAR2 expression in NAFLD patients. Conversely, PAR2 deficiency in mice resulted in reduced expression of key hepatic genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, a 50% drop in plasma and total liver cholesterol, and induced a reverse cholesterol transport system that culminated in 25% higher fecal bile  output. PAR2-deficient mice exhibited enhanced fatty  β-oxidation with a ketogenic shift and an unexpected increase in liver glycogenesis. Mechanistic studies identified G-Jnk1/2 as key downstream effectors of protease-activated PAR2 in the regulation of lipid and cholesterol homeostasis in liver.These data indicate that PAR2 may be a new target for the suppression of plasma cholesterol and hepatic fat accumulation in NAFLD and related  conditions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Low-dose antibiotics (LDA) have been widely used to enhance growth rate of pigs, providing a good animal model to study the underlying mechanism. In present study, 28 female piglets, weaned at 21 d, were randomly classified into two groups, receiving either a control diet or a diet supplemented with LDA for 4 weeks. The total bacterial load and intestinal microbiota were determined by qPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. UPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS and RNA-seq were further used to determine the colonic SCFAs and transcriptomes. Results showed that LDA significantly increased growth rate and food intake. The F/B index, Methanosphaera species, and the pathway of "carbohydrate " were improved by LDA exposure, indicating the better carbohydrate degradation and energy utilization. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated the microbial community contributing to SCFAs production was enriched upon LDA exposure, associating with increased concentrations of short-chain and branched-chain fatty  (caproate, 2-methyl butyrate and 4-methyl valerate). A multivariate linear fitting model analysis highlighted that caproate was positively correlated with two genera (Faecalibacterium and Allisonella) and four differentially expressed genes (ZNF134, TBX5, NEU4 and SEMA6D), which were all significantly increased upon LDA exposure. Collectively, our study indicates that the growth-promoting effect of LDA exposure in early life is associated with the shifts of colonic microbiota to increase utilization of carbohydrates and energy, enhanced SCFAs production and colonic functions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, the activities of these  in hepatomas in vivo have not been distinguished. Here we examined pyruvate entry into the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle through PDH versus PC in vivo using hepatoma-bearing rats.Hepatoma-bearing rats were generated by intrahepatic injection of H4IIE cells.  of C-labeled glycerol, a physiological substrate for both gluconeogenesis and energy production, was measured with C NMR analysis. The concentration of key metabolites and the expression of relevant enzymes were measured in hepatoma, surrounding liver, and normal liver.In orthotopic hepatomas, pyruvate entry into the TCA cycle occurred exclusively through PDH and the excess PDH activity compared to normal liver was attributed to downregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 2/4. However, pyruvate carboxylation via PC and gluconeogenesis were minimal, which was linked to downregulated forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) by Akt activity. In contrast to many studies of cancer , lactate production in hepatomas was not increased which corresponded to reduced expression of lactate dehydrogenase. The production of serine and glycine in hepatomas was enhanced, but glycine decarboxylase was downregulated.The combination of [U-C]glycerol and NMR analysis enabled investigation of multiple biochemical processes in hepatomas and surrounding liver. We demonstrated active PDH and other related  alterations in orthotopic hepatomas that differed substantially not only from the host organ but also from many earlier studies with cancer cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In the second, eight rumen-fistulated bulls were assigned in a switch back design to evaluate the fatty  profile of omasal fluid. We hypothesized that bulls fed DDGS may have an improved fatty  profile and expression of genes involved in lipid  may be altered, without affecting performance. Bulls fed DDGS had greater (P < .05) concentrations of PUFA n-6 in the omasum and muscle. CLA t10, c12 content was higher and there was lower expression of the LPL gene (P = .05) in the muscle of animals fed DDGS (P = .03). In conclusion, DDGS can be used as a protein feedstuff because it maintains beef quality.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Amongst these toxins, the most frequent and most studied have been alcohol and tobacco consumption, with a proven increased rate of overall cancer risk within the aero-digestive tract.The review was realized utilizing available studies on the subject of genetic polymorphisms analysis of deoxyribonucleic  (DNA) samples using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and laryngeal cancer published in the PubMed database.Statistical analysis of 262 polymorphisms shows a predominantly positive association between two genetic variants of the human genome (mutant homozygote and heterozygote) and cancer risk with significant influence on patient outcome and survival. Genotype combinations were divided into two categories depending on the individual 'at risk' and 'protective' allele within the loci of each inherited gene block. Amongst the genes involved with aero-digestive cancers, the most studied were those belonging to the xenobiotic , nucleotide excision repair (NER) and DNA repair . The presence of toxins has a distinct cumulative effect within the genotype-phenotype relationship, which further influences the presence of malignancy depending on the adaptability of each individual genome.Laryngeal cancer evolution is linked to inherited risk factors found within the genetic code. Most studied were the genes belonging to NER , DNA repair and xenobiotic , which all favored mutant homozygote and heterozygote variants, as high risk factors. Only five articles focused on overall survival rates with insufficient results to undisputedly predict the risk variants. The consumption of external toxins has a positive effect on the overall cancer risk in consumers.

Many bacteria use AMP-forming :CoA ligases to convert organic  into their corresponding acyl-CoA derivatives, which can then enter . The soil environment contains a broad diversity of organic , so it is not surprising that bacteria such as Streptomyces lividans can activate many of the available organic . Our group has shown that the activity of many :CoA ligases is posttranslationally controlled by acylation of an active-site lysine. In some cases, the modification is reversed by deacylases of different types. We identified eight new :CoA ligases in S. lividans TK24. Here, we report the range of organic  that each of these enzymes can activate, and determined that two newly identified CoA ligases were under NAD -dependent sirtuin deacylase reversible lysine (de)acetylation control, four were not acetylated by two acetyltransferases used in this work, and two were acetylated but not deacetylated by sirtuin.

We performed a systematic review using the PubMed/Medline database including primary articles written in English that measured leptin production or levels as well as SCFA used as an intervention, mechanism or outcome. The search yielded a total of 573 citations; 36 studies were included in the final analysis. The quality of the studies was analyzed through two validated tools based on objective criteria. Overall, the studies presented low risk of bias to construct and statistical validity. However, the majority presented a high risk of attrition and detection bias. In vitro studies (n = 8) consistently demonstrated that SCFA stimulate leptin expression in adipocytes through activation of free fatty  receptor 3 (FFAR3). In animal studies (n = 24), interventions to modulate high-fat diet outcomes predominantly caused a decrease in circulating leptin levels and increased SCFA, associated with suppressed weight gain. Control of dysbiosis through administration of prebiotics and probiotics also played a role in leptin synthesis in animal studies. In human studies (n = 4) leptin was mainly correlated with adiposity but dysbiosis interfered with this relationship. We conclude that the association between SCFA and leptin remains incompletely understood but occurs mainly through the activation of FFAR3 in adipocytes. However, body fat rather than SCFA remains the main driver for leptin synthesis in vivo. Future studies should aim to better clarify the role of SCFA in regulating leptin production in vivo.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

These patients receive low-toxicity disease-stabilizing treatment. The combination of all-trans retinoic  (ATRA) and the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic  can stabilize the disease for a subset of such patients. We performed untargeted serum metabolomic profiling for 44 AML patients receiving treatment based on ATRA and valproic  combined with low-dose cytotoxic drugs (cytarabine, hydroxyurea, 6-mercaptopurin) which identified 886 metabolites. When comparing pretreatment samples from responders and non-responders, metabolites mainly belonging to amino  and lipid (i.e., fatty )  were altered. Furthermore, patients with rapidly progressive disease showed an extensively altered lipid . Both ATRA and valproic  monotherapy also altered the amino  and lipid metabolite profiles; however, these changes were only highly significant for valproic  treatment. Twenty-three metabolites were significantly altered by seven-day valproic  treatment ( < 0.05,  < 0.05), where the majority of altered metabolites belonged to lipid (especially fatty  ) and amino  , including several carnitines.

Factors contributing to this predisposition include oxidized polyunsaturated fatty , also known as oxylipids, whose production is altered during the periparturient period and in diseased cattle. Alterations in the production of oxylipids derived from cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes are over-represented during times of increased disease risk and clinical disease, such as mastitis. Many of these same CYP450 enzymes additionally regulate  of fat-soluble vitamins, such as A, D, and E. These vitamins are essential to maintaining immune health, yet circulating concentrations are diminished near calving. Despite this, a relatively small amount of research has focused on the roles of CYP450 enzymes outside of the liver. The aim of this paper is to describe the relative gene expression of 11 CYP450 in bovine tissues and common in vitro bovine cell models. Eight tissue samples were collected from 3 healthy dairy cows after euthanasia. In vitro samples included primary bovine aortic and mammary endothelial cells and immortalized bovine kidney and mammary epithelial cells. Quantitative real-time-PCR was carried out to assess basal transcript expression of CYP450 enzymes. Surprisingly, CYP450 mRNA was widely expressed in all tissue samples, with predominance in the liver. In vitro CYP450 expression was less robust, with several cell types lacking expression of specific CYP450 enzymes altogether. Overall, cell culture models did not reflect expression of tissue CYP450. However, when CYP450 were organized by activity, certain cell types consistently expressed specific functional groups. These data reveal the widespread expression of CYP450 in individual organs of healthy dairy cows. Widespread expression helps to explain previous evidence of significant changes in CYP450-mediated oxylipid production and fat-soluble vitamin  in organ microenvironments during periods of oxidative stress or disease. As such, these data provide a foundation for targeted functional experiments aimed at understanding the activities of specific CYP450 and associated therapeutic potential during times of increased disease risk.Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

A previous study indicated that S. brachiariae had antifungal activity; however, limited genomic information restrains further study. Therefore, we sequenced the genome of S. brachiariae and compared it with the genome of S. oryzae to identify differences between a Sarocladium plant pathogen and an endophyte.In this study, we reported a gapless genome sequence of a newly identified endophytic fungus Sarocladium brachiariae isolated from Brachiaria brizantha. The genome of S. brachiariae is 31.86 Mb, with a contig N50 of 3.27 Mb and 9903 protein coding genes. Phylogenomic analysis based on single copy orthologous genes provided insights into the evolutionary relationships of S. brachiariae and its closest species was identified as S. oryzae. Comparative genomics analysis revealed that S. brachiaria has 14.9% more plant cell wall degradation related CAZymes to S. oryzae, and 33.3% more fungal cell wall degradation related CAZymes, which could explain the antifungal activity of S. brachiaria. Based on Antibiotics & Secondary Metabolite Analysis Shell (antiSMASH) analysis, we identified a contact helvolic  biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for the first time in S. oryzae. However, S. brachiaria had seven fewer terpene gene clusters, including helvolic  BGC, compared with S. oryzae and this may be associated with adaptation to an endophytic lifestyle. Synteny analysis of polyketide synthases (PKS), non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), and hybrid (PKS-NRPS) gene clusters between S. brachiariae and S. oryzae revealed that just 37.5% of tested clusters have good synteny, while 63.5% have no or poor synteny. This indicated that the S. brachiariae could potentially synthesize a variety of unknown-function secondary metabolites, which may play an important role in adaptation to its endophytic lifestyle and antifungal activity.The data provided a better understanding of the Sarocladium brachiariae genome. Further comparative genomic analysis provided insight into the genomic basis of its endophytic lifestyle and antifungal activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671820>Vitamin C in Plants: From Functions to Biofortification.</a></h1><p>Vitamin C (l-ascorbic ) is an excellent free radical scavenger, not only for its capability to donate reducing equivalents but also for the relative stability of the derived monodehydroascorbate radical. However, vitamin C is not only an antioxidant, since it is also a cofactor for numerous enzymes involved in plant and human . In humans, vitamin C takes part in various physiological processes, such as iron absorption, collagen synthesis, immune stimulation, and epigenetic regulation. Due to the functional loss of the gene coding for l-gulonolactone oxidase, humans cannot synthesize vitamin C; thus, they principally utilize plant-based foods for their needs. For this reason, increasing the vitamin C content of crops could have helpful effects on human health. To achieve this objective, exhaustive knowledge of the  and functions of vitamin C in plants is needed. In this review, the multiple roles of vitamin C in plant physiology as well as the regulation of its content, through biosynthetic or recycling , are analyzed. Finally, attention is paid to the strategies that have been used to increase the content of vitamin C in crops, emphasizing not only the improvement of nutritional value of the crops but also the acquisition of plant stress resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661818>Melatonin-Induced Transcriptome Variation of Rapeseed Seedlings under Salt Stress.</a></h1><p>Salt stress inhibits the production of all crop species, including rapeseed ( L.), the second most widely planted oil crop species. Although melatonin was confirmed to alleviate salt stress in rapeseed seedlings recently, the mechanism governing the expression levels remains unknown. Therefore, the melatonin-induced transcriptome variation of salt-stressed seedlings was explored. In this study, the transcriptomes of leaves and roots under control (CK), salt (125 mM NaCl, ST) and melatonin (125 mM NaCl plus 50 µM melatonin, MS) treatments were evaluated by using next-generation sequencing techniques. After conducting comparisons of gene expression in the roots and leaves between MS and ST, the differentially expressed gene (DEG) pools were screened. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses highlighted the significant , which were mainly related to plant hormone synthesis and signal transduction, lignin and fatty  . The functional genes in the objective KEGG  were identified. Furthermore, members of several transcription factor (TF) families participated in the response process. Combined with the hormone (campesterol (CS), jasmonic  (JA), and gibberellic  3 (GA3)) contents measured in the seedlings, it could be concluded that melatonin induced changes in the intrinsic hormone  network, which promoted seedling growth. Thus, this study identified new candidate genes and  active during the interactions between melatonin and salt stress, which provide clues for disclosing melatonin's function in resistance to salt injury.

The results of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size analysis also confirmed that these bacterial pathogens were significantly abundant in the wastewater treatment systems. Further, the results of this study highlighted that the presence of bacterial pathogens in treated effluent pose a potential contamination risk, transmitted through soil, agriculture, water, or sediments.

During hibernation, serum levels of cortisol, glycerol, and triglycerides were elevated, and protein expression and activation of AMPK in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue were reduced. mRNA expression of the co-activator PGC-1α was reduced in all tissues in hibernation whereas mRNA expression of the transcription factor PPAR-α was reduced in the vastus lateralis muscle and adipose tissue only. During hibernation, gene expression of ATGL and CD36 was not altered; however, HSL gene expression was reduced in adipose tissue. During hibernation gene expression of the lipogenic enzyme DGAT in all tissues and the expression of the FA oxidative enzyme LCAD in the vastus lateralis muscle were reduced. Gene and protein expression of the glucose transporter GLUT4 was decreased in adipose tissue in hibernation. Our data suggest that high cortisol levels are a key adaptation during hibernation and link cortisol to a reduced activation of the AMPK/PGC-1α/PPAR-α axis in the regulation of  in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Moreover, our results indicate that during this phase of hibernation at a time when  rate is significantly reduced  adaptations in peripheral tissues seek to limit the detrimental effects of unduly large energy dissipation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Protein phosphorylation carries out an important regulatory function in plant defense responses, while the global phosphoproteome changes in rice response to SA-mediated defense response has not been reported. In this study, a comparative phosphoproteomic profiling was conducted by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, with two near-isogenic rice cultivars after SA treatment.Thirty-seven phosphoprotein spots were differentially expressed after SA treatment, twenty-nine of which were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, belonging to nine functional categories. Phosphoproteins involved in photosynthesis, antioxidative enzymes, molecular chaperones were similarly expressed in the two cultivars, suggesting SA might alleviate decreases in plant photosynthesis, regulate the antioxidant defense activities, thus improving basal resistance response in both cultivars. Meanwhile, phosphoproteins related to defense, carbohydrate , protein synthesis and degradation were differentially expressed, suggesting phosphorylation regulation mediated by SA may coordinate complex cellular activities in the two cultivars. Furthermore, the phosphorylation sites of four identified phosphoproteins were verified by NanoLC-MS/MS, and phosphorylated regulation of three enzymes (cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, phosphoglycerate mutase and ascorbate peroxidase) was validated by activity determination.Our study suggested that phosphorylation regulation mediated by SA may contribute to the different resistance response of the two cultivars. To our knowledge, this is the first report to measure rice phosphoproteomic changes in response to SA, which provides new insights into molecular mechanisms of SA-induced rice defense.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657789>A Fluorescence-based Assay for Characterization and Quantification of Lipid Droplet Formation in Human Intestinal Organoids.</a></h1><p>Dietary lipids are taken up as free fatty  (FAs) by the intestinal epithelium. These FAs are intracellularly converted into triglyceride (TG) molecules, before they are packaged into chylomicrons for transport to the lymph or into cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) for intracellular storage. A crucial step for the formation of LDs is the catalytic activity of diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) in the final step of TG synthesis. LDs are important to buffer toxic lipid species and regulate cellular  in different cell types. Since the human intestinal epithelium is regularly confronted with high concentrations of lipids, LD formation is of great importance to regulate homeostasis. Here we describe a simple assay for the characterization and quantification of LD formation (LDF) upon stimulation with the most common unsaturated fatty , oleic , in human intestinal organoids. The LDF assay is based on the LD-specific fluorescent dye LD540, which allows for quantification of LDs by confocal microscopy, fluorescent plate reader, or flow cytometry. The LDF assay can be used to characterize LD formation in human intestinal epithelial cells, or to study human (genetic) disorders that affect LD , such as DGAT1 deficiency. Furthermore, this assay can also be used in a high-throughput pipeline to test novel therapeutic compounds, which restore defects in LD formation in intestinal or other types of organoids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666959>Non-aqueous fractionation revealed changing subcellular metabolite distribution during apple fruit development.</a></h1><p>In developing apple fruit,  compartmentation is poorly understood due to the lack of experimental data. Distinguishing subcellular compartments in fruit using non-aqueous fractionation has been technically difficult due to the excess amount of sugars present in the different subcellular compartments limiting the resolution of the technique. The work described in this study represents the first attempt to apply non-aqueous fractionation to developing apple fruit, covering the major events occurring during fruit development (cell division, cell expansion, and maturation). Here we describe the non-aqueous fractionation method to study the subcellular compartmentation of metabolites during apple fruit development considering three main cellular compartments (cytosol, plastids, and vacuole). Evidence is presented that most of the sugars and organic  were predominantly located in the vacuole, whereas some of the amino  were distributed between the cytosol and the vacuole. The results showed a shift in the plastid marker from the lightest fractions in the early growth stage to the dense fractions in the later fruit growth stages. This implies that the accumulation of starch content with progressing fruit development substantially influenced the distribution of plastidial fragments within the non-aqueous density gradient applied. Results from this study provide substantial baseline information on assessing the subcellular compartmentation of metabolites in apple fruit in general and during fruit growth in particular.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661763>Polyphenol Effects on Cholesterol  via Bile  Biosynthesis, CYP7A1: A Review.</a></h1><p>Atherosclerosis, the main contributor to coronary heart disease, is characterised by an accumulation of lipids such as cholesterol in the arterial wall. Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) reduces cholesterol via its conversion into bile  (BAs). During RCT in non-hepatic peripheral tissues, cholesterol is transferred to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and returned to the liver for conversion into BAs predominantly via the rate-limiting enzyme, cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). Numerous reports have described that polyphenol induced increases in BA excretion and corresponding reductions in total and LDL cholesterol in animal and in-vitro studies, but the process whereby this occurs has not been extensively reviewed. There are three main mechanisms by which BA excretion can be augmented: (1) increased expression of CYP7A1; (2) reduced expression of intestinal BA transporters; and (3) changes in the gut microbiota. Here we summarise the BA   focusing on CYP7A1, how its gene is regulated via transcription factors, diurnal rhythms, and microRNAs. Importantly, we will address the following questions: (1) Can polyphenols enhance BA secretion by modulating the CYP7A1 biosynthetic pathway? (2) Can polyphenols alter the BA pool via changes in the gut microbiota? (3) Which polyphenols are the most promising candidates for future research? We conclude that while in rodents some polyphenols induce CYP7A1 expression predominantly by the LXRα pathway, in human cells, this may occur through FXR, NF-KB, and ERK signalling. Additionally, gut microbiota is important for the de-conjugation and excretion of BAs. Puerarin, resveratrol, and quercetin are promising candidates for further research in this area.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682104>Integrated Metabolomics and Network Pharmacology Strategy-Driven Active Traditional Chinese Medicine Ingredients Discovery for the Alleviation of Cisplatin Nephrotoxicity.</a></h1><p>Renal injury is the main adverse reaction of cisplatin and many traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) were proved active against renal toxicity. Here, an integrated metabolomics and network pharmacology strategy was proposed to discover active TCM ingredients for the alleviation of cisplatin nephrotoxicity. First, by inquiring Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) we collected targets connected to 149 cisplatin nephrotoxicity related metabolites. Second, targets of kidney damage were obtained from Therapeutic Target Database (TTD), PharmGKB, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and Genetic Association Database (GAD). Common targets of both dysregulated metabolites and kidney damage were then used for TCM active ingredients screening applying network pharmacology approach. Eventually, 22 ingredients passed screening criteria and their anti-nephrotoxicity activity was assessed in human kidney tubular epithelial (HK2) cells. As a result, 14 ingredients were found effective, in which kaempferol showed relatively better activity. Further metabolomics analysis revealed that kaempferol exerted anti-nephrotoxicity effect in rat by regulating amino , pyrimidine and purine , as well as lipid . Collectively, this proposed integrated strategy would promote the transformation of metabolomics research in the field of drug pair discovery for the purpose of reduced toxicity and increased efficiency.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665416>IMG-ABC v.5.0: an update to the IMG/Atlas of Biosynthetic Gene Clusters Knowledgebase.</a></h1><p>Microbial secondary  is a reservoir of bioactive compounds of immense biotechnological and biomedical potential. The biosynthetic machinery responsible for the production of these secondary metabolites (SMs) (also called natural products) is often encoded by collocated groups of genes called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). High-throughput genome sequencing of both isolates and metagenomic samples combined with the development of specialized computational workflows is enabling systematic identification of BGCs and the discovery of novel SMs. In order to advance exploration of microbial secondary  and its diversity, we developed the largest publicly available database of predicted BGCs combined with experimentally verified BGCs, the Integrated Microbial Genomes Atlas of Biosynthetic gene Clusters (IMG-ABC) (https://img.jgi.doe.gov/abc-public).

Adipose tissue is a vital  organ in energy balance and glucose homeostasis. In this study, we investigated the role of VDR expressed on adipose tissue in the balance of energy . This study was conducted in VDR-KO mice, VDR-Tg mice and wild-type mice. Energy  was determined based on the energy expenditure, oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange rate, food and water intake, and a cool room test. VDR expression in the tissues of VDR-Tg mice was assessed by western blotting. The levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty , leptin, and glucose were assessed using the respective kits. Insulin resistance in the whole body was evaluated by an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test. mRNA associated with energy  expression in adipose and skeletal muscle tissue was examined by RT-PCR. Our results show that overexpression of VDR in adipose tissue induced an increase in body weight, fat mass, and serum lipid levels, and a decline in energy ; these changes were ameliorated by VDR-KO mice. Overexpression of VDR in the adipose tissue of VDR-Tg mice induced a state of insulin resistance, which corresponded with decreased expression of UCP1, UCP2, UCP3, CPT2 and HK in both white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue; these changes were also reversed by VDR-KO mice. Our study confirms that expression levels of VDR in adipose tissue play pivotal roles in energy balance and glycolipid  by regulating adipose tissue remodeling.Copyright © 2019.

The biodegradation of cyanuric  has been elucidated using a single model system,  sp. ADP, in which cyanuric  hydrolase (AtzD) opens the -triazine ring and AtzEG deaminates the ring-opened product. A significant question remains as to whether the  pathway found in  sp. ADP is the exception or the rule in bacterial genomes globally. Here we show that most bacteria utilize a different pathway metabolizing cyanuric  via biuret. The new pathway was determined by reconstituting the pathway  with purified enzymes and by mining more than 250,000 genomes and metagenomes. We isolated soil bacteria that grow on cyanuric  as a sole nitrogen source and showed that the genome from a  strain had a canonical cyanuric  hydrolase gene but different flanking genes. The flanking gene  encoded an enzyme that we show catalyzed the decarboxylation of the cyanuric  hydrolase product, carboxybiuret. The reaction generated biuret, a pathway intermediate further transformed by biuret hydrolase (BiuH). The prevalence of the newly defined pathway was determined by co-occurrence analysis of cyanuric  hydrolases and flanking genes. Here we show the biuret pathway was more than one order of magnitude more prevalent than the original  sp. ADP pathway. Mining a database of over 40,000 bacterial isolates with precise geospatial metadata showed that bacteria with concurrent cyanuric  and biuret hydrolase genes were distributed throughout the United States. Cyanuric  is produced naturally as a contaminant in urea fertilizer and it is used as a chlorine stabilizer in swimming pools. Cyanuric  degrading bacteria are used commercially in removing cyanuric  from pool water when it exceeds desired levels. The total volume of cyanuric  produced annually exceeds two hundred million kilograms, most of which enters the natural environment. In this context, it is important to have a global understanding of cyanuric  biodegradation by microbial communities in natural and engineered systems. Current knowledge of cyanuric   largely derives from studies on the enzymes from a single model organism,  sp. ADP. In this study, we obtained and studied new microbes and discovered a previously unknown cyanuric  degradation pathway. The new pathway identified here was found to be much more prevalent than the pathway previously established for  sp. ADP. In addition, the type of environment, taxonomic prevalence, and geospatial distribution of the different cyanuric  degradation  are described here.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676443>Increased fatty  oxidation and mitochondrial proliferation in liver are associated with increased plasma kynurenine metabolites and nicotinamide levels in normolipidemic and carnitine-depleted rats.</a></h1><p>Dysregulation of the tryptophan (Trp)-NAD pathway has been related to several pathological conditions, and the metabolites in this pathway are known to influence mitochondrial respiration and redox status. The aim of this project was to investigate if stimulation of beta-oxidation and mitochondrial proliferation by the mitochondrial-targeted compound 2-(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic  (1-triple TTA) would influence metabolites of the Trp-Kyn-NAD pathway. We wished to investigate how carnitine depletion by meldonium-treatment influenced these metabolites. After dietary treatment of male Wistar rats with 1-triple TTA for three weeks, increased hepatic mitochondrial- and peroxisomal fatty  oxidation resulted. The plasma content of total carnitines decreased compared to control animals, whereas hepatic genes involved in CoA biosynthesis were upregulated by 1-triple TTA treatment. The plasma Trp level and individual metabolites in the kynurenine pathway were increased by 1-triple TTA, associated with decreased hepatic gene expression of indoleamine2,3-dioxygenase. 1-triple TTA treatment increased conversion of Trp to nicotinamide (Nam) as the plasma content of quinolinic , Nam and N1-methylnicotinamide (mNam) increased, accompanied with suppression of hepatic gene expression of α-amino-α-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase. A positive correlation between mitochondrial fatty  oxidation and Trp-derivatives was found. Almost identical results were obtained by 1-triple TTA in the presence of meldonium, which alone exerted minor effects. Moreover, the plasma Kyn:Trp ratio (KTR) correlated negatively to mitochondrial function. Whether increased flux through the Trp-NAD pathway increased redox status and lowered inflammation locally and systemically should be considered.Copyright © 2019.

A watermelon collection consisting of 187 wild, landraces, and cultivated accessions was used to estimate citrulline content. An association analysis involved a total of 12,125 SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) >0.05 in understanding the population structure and phylogeny in light of citrulline accumulation. Wild egusi types and landraces contained low to medium citrulline content, whereas cultivars had higher content, which suggests that obtaining higher content of citrulline is a domesticated trait. GWAS analysis identified candidate genes ( and  ) showing a significant association of SNPs with citrulline content. Haplotype networking indicated positive selection from wild to domesticated watermelon.

Higher levels of RBC DHA, EPA, arachidonic  (ARA), and linoleic  (LA) and were observed for  rs4846052 TT genotype versus TC and CC genotypes. Genetic variations in  rs1109859 and  rs4846052 were associated with different PUFA levels in RBC membranes and are estimators for PUFA species in RBCs. Further research is needed to establish whether these genotype-specific alterations are specific to overweight children.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664643>Allopregnanolone Reverses Bioenergetic Deficits in Female Triple Transgenic Alzheimer's Mouse Model.</a></h1><p>Previously, we reported that the neurosteroid allopregnanolone (Allo) promoted neural stem cell regeneration, restored cognitive function, and reduced Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology in the triple transgenic Alzheimer's mouse model (3xTgAD). To investigate the underlying systems biology of Allo action in AD models in vivo, we assessed the regulation of Allo on the bioenergetic system of the brain. Outcomes of these analysis indicated that Allo significantly reversed deficits in mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis and key mitochondrial enzyme activity and reduced lipid peroxidation in the 3xTgAD mice in vivo. To explore the mechanisms by which Allo regulates the brain , we conducted targeted transcriptome analysis. These data further confirmed that Allo upregulated genes involved in glucose , mitochondrial bioenergetics, and signaling  while simultaneously downregulating genes involved in Alzheimer's pathology, fatty  , and mitochondrial uncoupling and dynamics. Upstream regulatory pathway analysis predicted that Allo induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) and coactivator 1-alpha (PPARGC1A)  while simultaneously inhibiting the presenilin 1 (PSEN 1), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)  to reduce AD pathology. Collectively, these data indicate that Allo functions as a systems biology regulator of bioenergetics, cholesterol homeostasis, and β-amyloid reduction in the brain. These systems are critical to neurological health, thus providing a plausible mechanistic rationale for Allo as a therapeutic to promote neural cell function and reduce the burden of AD pathology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672551>Fasting reveals largely intact systemic lipid mobilization mechanisms in respiratory chain complex III deficient mice.</a></h1><p>Mice homozygous for the human GRACILE syndrome mutation (Bcs1l) display decreased respiratory chain complex III activity, liver dysfunction, hypoglycemia, rapid loss of white adipose tissue and early death. To assess the underlying mechanism of the lipodystrophy in homozygous mice (Bcs1l), these and wild-type control mice were subjected to a short 4-hour fast. The homozygotes had low baseline blood glucose values, but a similar decrease in response to fasting as in wild-type mice, resulting in hypoglycemia in the majority. Despite the already depleted glycogen and increased triacylglycerol content in the mutant livers, the mice responded to fasting by further depletion and increase, respectively. Increased plasma free fatty  (FAs) upon fasting suggested normal capacity for mobilization of lipids from white adipose tissue into circulation. Strikingly, however, serum glycerol concentration was not increased concomitantly with free FAs, suggesting its rapid uptake into the liver and utilization for fuel or gluconeogenesis in the mutants. The mutant hepatocyte mitochondria were capable of responding to fasting by appropriate morphological changes, as analyzed by electron microscopy, and by increasing respiration. Mutants showed increased hepatic gene expression of major  controllers typically associated with fasting response (Ppargc1a, Fgf21, Cd36) already in the fed state, suggesting a chronic starvation-like  condition. Despite this, the mutant mice responded largely normally to fasting by increasing hepatic respiration and switching to FA utilization, indicating that the mechanisms driving these adaptations are not compromised by the CIII dysfunction. SUMMARY STATEMENT: Bcs1l mutant mice with severe CIII deficiency, energy deprivation and post-weaning lipolysis respond to fasting similarly to wild-type mice, suggesting largely normal systemic lipid mobilization and utilization mechanisms.Copyright © 2019.

In the present study, proteomic analyses were performed for leaf samples from control (healthy) and susceptible BCMV infected plants. The differential expression of proteins was evaluated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Approximately, 1098 proteins were spotted, amongst which 107 proteins were observed to be statistically significant with differential expression. The functional categorization of the differential proteins illustrated that they were involved in biotic/abiotic stress (18%), energy and carbon  (11%), photosynthesis (46%), protein biosynthesis (10%), chaperoning (5%), chlorophyll (5%) and polyunsaturated fatty  biosynthesis (5%). This is the first report on the comparative proteome study of compatible plant-BCMV interactions in P. vulgaris which contributes largely to the understanding of protein-mediated disease resistance/susceptible mechanisms.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Relative to wild type, the selected complex I, II, and III mutants showed decreased total respiration, increased alternative respiration, as well as increased redox charge of the NADP(H) pool and decreased redox charge of the NAD(H) pool in the dark. In the light, mETC mutants accumulated free amino , albeit to varying degrees. Glycine and serine, which are involved in carbon recycling from photorespiration, and N-rich amino  were predominantly increased in mETC mutants compared to the wild type. Taking together the physiological phenotypes of all examined mutants, our results suggest a connection between the limitation in the re-oxidation of reducing equivalents in the mitochondrial matrix and the induction of nitrate assimilation into free amino  in the cytosol, which seems to be engaged as an additional sink for reducing power. The  mutant was less susceptible to  and did not show hampered salicylic  (SA) accumulation as previously reported for  knock-down plants. The ROS burst remained unaffected in , emonstrating that subunit SDH2 is not involved in the control of ROS production and SA signaling by complex II. Moreover, the  mutant showed only 20% of  colonization compared to wild type, with the ROS burst and the production of callose papillae being significantly increased compared to wild type. This indicates that a restriction of respiratory  can positively affect pre-penetration resistance of . Taking metabolite profiling data from all investigated mETC mutants, a strong positive correlation of resistance toward  with NADPH pool size, pyruvate contents, and other metabolites associated with redox poise and energy charge was evident, which fosters the hypothesis that limitations in the mETC can support resistance at post-penetration stages by improving the availability of  power.Copyright © 2019 McCollum, Geißelsöder, Engelsdorf, Voitsik and Voll.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676441>PPARA/RXRA signalling regulates the fate of hepatic non-esterified fatty  in a sheep model of maternal undernutrition.</a></h1><p>Maternal undernutrition during late gestation accelerates body fat mobilization to provide more energy for foetal growth and development, which unbalances  homeostasis and results in serious lipid  disorder. However, detailed regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, a sheep model was used to explore the regulatory role of PPARA/RXRA signalling in hepatic lipid  in undernutrition based on RNA sequencing and cell experiments. KOG function classification showed that lipid transport and  was markedly altered in an undernourished model. In detail, when compared with the controls, fatty  transport and oxidation and triglyceride  were up-regulated in an undernourished model, while fatty  synthesis, steroid synthesis, and phospholipid  were down-regulated. Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis demonstrated that PPARA/RXRA signalling pathway was altered. Moreover, PPARA signalling associated genes were positively correlated with hepatic non-esterified fatty  (NEFA) levels, while retinol  associated genes were negatively correlated with blood beta-hydroxybutyric  (BHBA) levels. Results of primary hepatocytes showed that NEFAs could activate PPARA signalling and facilitate fatty  oxidation (FAO) and ketogenesis, while BHBA could inhibit RXRA signalling and repress FAO and ketogenesis. Excessively accumulated NEFAs in hepatocytes promoted triglyceride synthesis. Furthermore, activation of PPARA/RXRA signalling by WY14643 and 9-cis-retinoic  could enhance FAO and ketogenesis and reduce NEFAs accumulation and esterification. Our findings elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of NEFAs and BHBA on lipid  as well as the potential role of the PPARA/RXRA signalling pathway in hepatic lipid , which may contribute to exploring new strategies to maintain lipid  homeostasis in human beings.Copyright © 2019.

Using the transparent visibility of zebrafish, the strains for intestinal peristalsis were quickly screened. The methods and results were as follows: (1) 18 strains with outstanding gastrointestinal viability via their surface hydrophobicity, self-aggregation ability,  tolerance, bile tolerance, simulated gastric digestion and intestinal fluid tolerance were determined from 54 unpublished strains. (2) 5dpf zebrafish were randomly selected and divided into 22 groups with 12 tails in each group. The intestinal peristalsis frequency of each group within 1 min was calculated after immersing the model zebrafish in a 108 CFU mL-1 strain solution, with 5 effective strains obtained. (3) The serotonin in zebrafish was measured by Elisa and fluorescence immunization. The regulation mechanism of serotonin by Bifidobacterium animalis F1-7 was revealed by RT-PCR and the results show that this most effective strain promotes intestinal peristalsis in zebrafish via the modulation of serotonin release and key genes for serotonin synthesis in zebrafish.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678479>Fatty  synthase and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 are conserved druggable cofactors of Old World Alphavirus genome replication.</a></h1><p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a rapidly emerging mosquito-borne RNA virus that causes epidemics of debilitating disease in tropical and sub-tropical regions with autochtonous transmission in regions with temperate climate. Currently, there is no licensed vaccine or specific antiviral drug available against CHIKV infection. In this study, we examine the role, in the CHIKV viral cycle, of fatty  synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1), two key lipogenic enzymes required for fatty  production and early desaturation. We show that both enzymes and their upstream regulator PI3K are required for optimal CHIKV infection. We demonstrate that pharmacologic manipulation of FASN or SCD1 enzymatic activity by non-toxic concentrations of cerulenin or CAY10566 decreases CHIKV genome replication. Interestingly, a similar inhibitory effect was also obtained with Orlistat, an FDA-approved anti-obesity drug that targets FASN activity. These drugs were also effective against Mayaro virus (MAYV), an under-studied arthritogenic Old world Alphavirus endemic in South American countries with potential risk of emergence, urbanization and dispersion to other regions.

Several kinases use PPi as a substrate and these kinases have recently been suggested to have evolved from ATP-dependent functional homologs, which have significant amino  sequence similarity to PPi-utilizing enzymes. In contrast, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) can be divided into three types according to the phosphate donor (ATP, GTP, or PPi), and the amino  sequence similarity of these PEPCKs is too low to confirm that they share a common ancestor. Here, we solved the crystal structure of a PPi-PEPCK homolog from the bacterium Actinomyces israelii (AiPEPCK) at 2.6 Å resolution and compared it with previously reported structures from ATP- and GTP-specific PEPCKs to assess the degrees of similarities and divergences among these PEPCKs and to determine the structural basis for the PPi specificity of PPi-type PEPCKs. These comparisons revealed that the amino  residues directly contributing to substrate recognition, except for those that recognize purine moieties, are conserved. Furthermore, the order of secondary structure elements between PPi-, ATP- and GTP-specific PEPCKs was strictly conserved. The structure-based comparisons of the three PEPCK types provide key insights into the structural basis for PPi specificity and suggest that all of these PEPCKs are derived from a common ancestor.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666479>Diosgenin Supplementation Prevents Lipid Accumulation and Induces Skeletal Muscle-Fiber Hypertrophy in Rats.</a></h1><p>Diosgenin (Dio) is a steroid sapogenin found in plants such as Dioscorea species, and is recognized as a phytochemical against various disorders as well as a natural precursor of steroidal drugs. The present study used rats fed high-cholesterol (Chol) diets supplemented with or without 0.5% Dio for 6 wk to investigate the effects of dietary Dio on lipid . Dio supplementation significantly increased serum high-density lipoprotein Chol concentrations and fecal Chol content, and significantly decreased fecal bile  content compared rats fed a high-Chol diet alone, showing that dietary Dio may facilitate excretion of Chol rather than bile . A reduction in the liver triglyceride content and intra-abdominal visceral fat was observed in Dio-supplemented rats. Interestingly, dietary Dio also significantly increased the skeletal muscle-fiber diameter and area in the thigh muscles of the rats. Mouse myoblast-derived C2C12 cells were used to examine whether Dio directly affected skeletal muscle. Dio promoted fusion of myoblasts into multinucleated cells or myotubes. Furthermore, in myotube C2C12 cells, protein levels of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increased with Dio treatment in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that Dio may not only induce myoblast fusion and enhance skeletal muscle as an energy expenditure organ, but may also activate the catabolic pathway via AMPK in skeletal muscle cells. Thus, these effects of Dio on skeletal muscles may contribute to inhibition of visceral fat accumulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678900>Bile  abnormality induced by intestinal dysbiosis might explain lipid  in Parkinson's disease.</a></h1><p>Intestinal dysbiosis refers to an imbalance in the intestinal flora. The concept of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), a condition of abnormal proliferation of the small intestine microbiota, has been proposed as a form of small intestine dysbiosis. In Parkinson's disease patients, weight loss and  disorders such as lipid abnormalities are frequently encountered. This was a prospective investigation of the presence of SIBO using the lactulose breath test, Parkinson's disease symptoms, medications, abdominal symptoms, and blood data involving 39 Parkinson's disease patients. Of the 39 patients, 19 were positive for SIBO, 16 were negative, and 4 were equivocal. SIBO-positive patients had a significantly smaller dopaminergic drug load (dopamine replacement of Parkinson's disease drug potency) (P = 0.009) and significantly lower serum triglyceride (TG) (P = 0.024) and total bilirubin (P = 0.019) levels. No relationship was seen between the presence or absence of SIBO and motor or abdominal symptoms. The following hypothesis was developed with regard to the possibility that intestinal bacterial overgrowth has various effects that are exhibited via bile   in Parkinson's disease patients. Serum bilirubin levels become higher as bilirubin  declines with decreases in the intestinal bacteria. At the same time, bile  is broken down due to increased intestinal bacteria, and lipid absorption decreases. This induces low serum TG levels and leads to weight loss. By a similar mechanism, there is less absorption of vitamin D as bile  levels decrease, leading to osteoporosis and fractures. The possibility that some of the non-motor manifestations accompanying Parkinson's disease are caused by intestinal dysbiosis needs to be considered.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Insulin and insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) share many intracellular processes with both known to play a key role in glucose and protein  in skeletal muscle.We aimed to compare IGF/IP6K1/Akt signalling and the plasma proteomic signature in individuals with a range of BMIs after ingestion of lean meat.Ten lean [Body mass index (BMI) (in kg/m): 22.7 ± 0.4; Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA): 1.36 ± 0.17], 10 overweight (BMI: 27.1 ± 0.5; HOMA: 1.25 ± 0.11), and 10 obese (BMI: 35.9 ± 1.3; HOMA: 5.82 ± 0.81) adults received primed continuous L-[ring-C]phenylalanine infusions.

IP6K1 was elevated in obese individuals at 120 min post-prandial vs basal (P < .05). There were no acute differences plasma proteomic profiles between groups in the post-prandial state (P > .05).These data demonstrate, for the first time that muscle IP6K1 protein content is elevated after lean meat ingestion in obese adults, suggesting that IP6K1 may be contributing to the dysregulation of nutrient uptake in skeletal muscle.

Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is a representative eurythermic fish that can survive at a wide range of ambient temperatures, allowing it to live in an extensive geographical range. The goal of this work was to study the glucose  of common carp at different temperatures and determine the miRNAs involved in the regulation of glucose . We determined the indicators related to glucose  after long-term temperature stress and constructed nine small RNA libraries of livers under different temperature stress (5 °C, 17 °C, and 30 °C, with three biological replicates for each temperature), and subjected these samples to high-throughput sequencing. A positive relationship was observed between weight gain rate (WGR) and temperature increase after 18 days of temperature stress. However, the glucose level in the plasma maintained a gentle decrease. Unexpectedly, liver lactic  levels were elevated in HTG (high temperature group) and LTG (low temperature group). Six down-regulated miRNAs (miR-122, miR-30b, miR-15b-5p, miR-20a-5p, miR-1, and miR-7b) were identified as involved in the regulation of glycolysis. Twelve genes were predicted as targets of these miRNAs, and these genes are in  related to pyruvate , glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and the citrate cycle (TCA cycle). The results allowed prediction of a potential regulatory network of miRNAs involved in the regulation of glycolysis. The target genes of six down-regulated miRNAs were up-regulated under temperature stress, including Aldolase C, fructose-bisphosphate, b (ALDOCB), multiple inositol-polyphosphate phosphatase 1 (MINPP1), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1), pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha 1 (PDHA1), aldehyde dehydrogenase 9 family member A1a (ALDH9A1A), Acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase (ACSS), lactate dehydrogenase b (LDH-b), and glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR). Other key genes of glycolysis, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1), pyruvate kinase PKM (PKM), and mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) were significantly up-regulated in LTG and HTG. Overall, the results suggest that miRNAs maintain their energy requirements by regulating glycolysis and play an important role in the molecular response to cold and heat stress of common carp. These data provide the foundation for further studies of the role of miRNAs in environmental adaptation in fish.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Light is one of the major environmental factors influencing coloration and carotenoid content and composition of fleshy fruits and therefore their commercial and nutritional quality. Agronomical observations indicate that citrus fruits exposed to sunlight develop a brighter peel coloration than shaded fruit inside the tree canopy. In the present study, the effect of light deprivation on carotenoid profile, and in the expression of genes of carotenoid  and their precursors have been analyzed in fruits of Clemenules mandarin () and Navelina orange (). Fruit shading accelerated peel degreening, chlorophyll degradation, and reduced chloroplastic-type carotenoids. Time-course shading experiments revealed that the stage of fruit ripening appears to be determinant for the effect of darkness in carotenoid biosynthesis. Fruit shading produced a down-regulation of the expression of key carotenoids biosynthetic genes (, , , , , and ). However, expression of MEP pathway genes (, , and ) and the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase, , responsible of the formation of the apocarotenoid β-citraurin, were not substantially affected by dark-grown conditions. The content of abscisic  (ABA), an end product of the carotenoid pathway, was not affected by the light regime, suggesting that effect of shading on the precursor's pool is not sufficient to impair ABA synthesis. A moderate increase in total carotenoid and in the expression of biosynthetic genes was observed in mature dark-grown mandarin and orange fruits. Collectively, results suggest that light stimulates carotenoid biosynthesis in the peel of citrus fruits but a light-independent regulation may also operate.Copyright © 2019 Lado, Alós, Manzi, Cronje, Gómez-Cadenas, Rodrigo and Zacarías.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660434>A Localized Chimeric Hydrogel Therapy Combats Tumor Progression through Alteration of Sphingolipid .</a></h1><p>Rapid proliferation of cancer cells assisted by endothelial cell-mediated angiogenesis and acquired inflammation at the tumor microenvironment (TME) lowers the success rate of chemotherapeutic regimens. Therefore, targeting these processes using localized delivery of a minimally toxic drug combination may be a promising strategy. Here, we present engineering of a biocompatible self-assembled lithocholic -dipeptide derived hydrogel (TRI-Gel) that can maintain sustained delivery of antiproliferating doxorubicin, antiangiogenic combretastatin-A4 and anti-inflammatory dexamethasone. Application of TRI-Gel therapy to a murine tumor model promotes enhanced apoptosis with a concurrent reduction in angiogenesis and inflammation, leading to effective abrogation of tumor proliferation and increased median survival with reduced drug resistance. In-depth RNA-sequencing analysis showed that TRI-Gel therapy induced transcriptome-wide alternative splicing of many genes responsible for oncogenic transformation including sphingolipid genes. We demonstrate that TRI-Gel therapy targets the reversal of a unique intron retention event in β-glucocerebrosidase 1 (), thereby increasing the availability of functional Gba1 protein. An enhanced Gba1 activity elevates ceramide levels responsible for apoptosis and decreases glucosylceramides to overcome drug resistance. Therefore, TRI-Gel therapy provides a unique system that affects the TME via post-transcriptional modulations of sphingolipid  genes, thereby opening a new and rational approach to cancer therapy.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664444>Effect of Combination l-Citrulline and Metformin Treatment on Motor Function in Patients With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: A Randomized Clinical Trial.</a></h1><p>Nitric oxide precursors, such as the amino  l-arginine and the biguanide antidiabetic drug metformin, have been associated with  and muscle function in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The treatment of DMD remains an unmet medical need.To evaluate the benefits and harms of a combination of l-citrulline and metformin treatment among patients with DMD.A single-center randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group clinical trial was conducted between December 12, 2013, and March 30, 2016, at the University Children's Hospital Basel in Switzerland. A total of 47 ambulant male patients aged 6.5 to 10 years with genetically confirmed DMD were recruited locally and from the patient registries of Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and France. Data were analyzed from April 6, 2016, to September 5, 2019.Patients in the treatment group received 2500 mg of l-citrulline and 250 mg of metformin (combination therapy) 3 times a day for 26 weeks compared with patients in the control group, who received placebo.The primary end point was the change in transfer and standing posture, as assessed by the first dimension of the Motor Function Measure, version 32, from baseline to week 26. Secondary end points included assessments of timed function, quantitative muscle force, biomarkers for muscle necrosis, and adverse events. The 2 prespecified subgroups comprised patients who were able to walk 350 m or more in 6 minutes (stable subgroup) and patients who were not able to walk 350 m in 6 minutes (unstable subgroup) at baseline.Among 49 ambulant male children with DMD who were screened for eligibility, 47 patients with a mean (SD) age of 8.2 (1.1) years were randomized to a treatment group receiving combination therapy (n = 23) or a control group receiving placebo (n = 24), and 45 patients completed the study. No significant differences between groups were found in the results of timed function and muscle force tests for overall, proximal and axial, and distal motor function. Among patients receiving combination therapy, the Motor Function Measure first dimension subscore decrease was 5.5% greater than that of patients receiving placebo (95% CI, -1.0% to 12.1%; P = .09). The administration of combination therapy had significantly favorable effects on the first dimension subscore decrease among the 29 patients in the stable subgroup (6.7%; 95% CI, 0.9%-12.6%; P = .03) but not among the 15 patients in the unstable subgroup (3.9%; 95% CI, -13.2% to 20.9%; P = .63). Overall, the treatment was well tolerated with only mild adverse effects.Treatment with combination therapy was not associated with an overall reduction in motor function decline among ambulant patients with DMD; however, a reduction in motor function decline was observed among the stable subgroup of patients treated with combination therapy. The statistically nonsignificant difference of distal motor function in favor of combination therapy and the reduced degeneration of muscle tissue appear to support the treatment concept, but the study may have lacked sufficient statistical power. Further research exploring this treatment option with a greater number of patients is warranted.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670380>Metabolomics study of fasudil on cisplatin-induced kidney injury.</a></h1><p>Fasudil is a derivative of 5-isoquinoline sulfonamide, which is a Rho kinase inhibitor, a wide range of pharmacological effects.

In the present study, metabolomic analysis of mouse kidney tissues ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to determine the metabolomic changes in cisplatin-induced kidney injury and the fasudil-induced attenuation of cisplatin-induced kidney injury. Metabolomic profiling of kidney tissues revealed significant differences in metabolites between the control group and the cisplatin group and between the cisplatin group and the fasudil-intervention group. With metabolomic approach, 68 endogenous differential metabolites were found, and multivariate statistical analysis, accurate molecular weights, isotope tracers, mass-spectrometry secondary-fragment information, and standard-reference comparisons were used to identify these substances. Based on these differential metabolites, a -pathway network was constructed and revealed that fasudil primarily attenuated cisplatin-induced renal injury by modulating lipid and amino- . These results further demonstrate that kidney injury can be induced by cisplatin and, moreover, suggest that fasudil can be used to reduce kidney injury at early stages in patients treated with cisplatin.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681351>Regulation of Pyridine Nucleotide  During Tomato Fruit Development Through Transcript and Protein Profiling.</a></h1><p>Central  is the engine of plant biomass, supplying fruit growth with building blocks, energy, and biochemical cofactors. Among  cornerstones, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is particularly pivotal for electron transfer through reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions, thus participating in a myriad of biochemical processes. Besides redox functions, NAD is now assumed to act as an integral regulator of signaling cascades involved in growth and environmental responses. However, the regulation of NAD  and signaling during fruit development remains poorly studied and understood. Here, we benefit from RNAseq and proteomic data obtained from nine growth stages of tomato fruit (var. Moneymaker) to dissect mRNA and protein profiles that link to NAD , including  biosynthesis, recycling, utilization, and putative transport. As expected for a cofactor synthesis pathway, protein profiles failed to detect enzymes involved in NAD synthesis or utilization, except for nicotinic  phosphoribosyltransferase (NaPT) and nicotinamidase (NIC), which suggested that most NAD  enzymes were poorly represented quantitatively. Further investigations on transcript data unveiled differential expression patterns during fruit development. Interestingly, among specific NAD -related genes, early  biosynthetic genes were transcriptionally induced in very young fruits, in association with NAD kinase, while later stages of fruit growth rather showed an accumulation of transcripts involved in later stages of  synthesis and in NAD recycling, which agreed with augmented NAD(P) levels. In addition, a more global overview of 119 mRNA and 78 protein significant markers for NAD(P)-dependent enzymes revealed differential patterns during tomato growth that evidenced clear regulations of primary , notably with respect to mitochondrial functions. Overall, we propose that NAD  and signaling are very dynamic in the developing tomato fruit and that its differential regulation is certainly critical to fuel central  linking to growth mechanisms.Copyright © 2019 Decros, Beauvoit, Colombié, Cabasson, Bernillon, Arrivault, Guenther, Belouah, Prigent, Baldet, Gibon and Pétriacq.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671667>Methods and Guidelines for Measurement of Glucagon in Plasma.</a></h1><p>Glucagon circulates in concentrations in the low picomolar range, which is demanding regarding the sensitivity of the methods for quantification applied.

There is very solid evidence that glucagon is an important hormone in human and mammalian , but its precise physiological role in glucose and lipid  and in  disease has been difficult to establish, not least because of these difficulties. It was our purpose with this review to discuss the methods of glucagon quantification and discuss pitfalls and sources of error. We also reviewed some of the dogmas regarding glucagon secretion in the light of the methodological difficulties.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673919>The actinobacterium Tsukamurella paurometabola has a functionally divergent arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) homolog.</a></h1><p>Actinobacteria in the Tsukamurella genus are aerobic, high-GC, Gram-positive mycolata, considered as opportunistic pathogens and isolated from various environmental sources, including sites contaminated with oil, urban or industrial waste and pesticides. Although studies look into xenobiotic biotransformation by Tsukamurella isolates, the relevant enzymes remain uncharacterized. We investigated the arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) enzyme family, known for its role in the xenobiotic  of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Xenobiotic sensitivity of Tsukamurella paurometabola type strain DSM 20162 was assessed, followed by cloning, recombinant expression and functional characterization of its single NAT homolog (TSUPD)NAT1. The bacterium appeared quite robust against chloroanilines, but more sensitive to 4-anisidine and 2-aminophenol. However,  activity was not evident towards those compounds, presumably due to mechanisms protecting cells from xenobiotic entry. Of the pharmaceutical arylhydrazines tested, hydralazine was toxic, but the bacterium was less sensitive to isoniazid, a drug targeting mycolic  biosynthesis in mycobacteria. Although (TSUPD)NAT1 protein has an atypical Cys-His-Glu (instead of the expected Cys-His-Asp) catalytic triad, it is enzymatically active, suggesting that this deviation is likely due to evolutionary adaptation potentially serving a different function. The protein was indeed found to use malonyl-CoA, instead of the archetypal acetyl-CoA, as its preferred donor substrate. Malonyl-CoA is important for microbial biosynthesis of fatty  (including mycolic ) and polyketide chains, and the corresponding enzymatic systems have common evolutionary histories, also linked to xenobiotic . This study adds to accummulating evidence suggesting broad phylogenetic and functional divergence of microbial NAT enzymes that goes beyond xenobiotic  and merits investigation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680488>The serine transporter SdaC prevents cell lysis upon glucose depletion in Escherichia coli.</a></h1><p>The amino  serine plays diverse  roles, yet bacteria actively degrade exogenously provided serine via deamination to pyruvate. Serine deamination is thought to be a detoxification mechanism due to the ability of serine to inhibit several biosynthetic reactions, but this pathway remains highly active even in nutrient-replete conditions. While investigating the physiological roles of serine deamination in different growth conditions, we discovered that Escherichia coli cells lacking the sdaCB operon, which encodes the serine transporter SdaC and the serine deaminase SdaB, lyse upon glucose depletion in a medium containing no exogenous serine but all other amino  and nucleobases. Unexpectedly, this lysis phenotype can be recapitulated by deleting sdaC alone and can be rescued by heterologous expression of SdaC. Lysis of ΔsdaC cells can be prevented by omitting glycine from the medium, inhibiting the glycine cleavage system, or by increasing alanine availability. Together, our results reveal that the serine transporter SdaC plays a critical role in maintaining amino  homeostasis during shifts in nutrient availability in E. coli.© 2019 The Authors.

Glucose, amino , and fatty  are the chief fuel sources for bone resident cells during its remodeling. Lipids, which can be mobilized from intracellular depots in the bone marrow, can be a potent source of fatty . Thus, while it has been suggested that adipocytes in the bone marrow act as "filler" and are detrimental to skeletal homeostasis, we propose that marrow lipids are, in fact, essential for proper bone functioning. As such, we examine the prevailing evidence regarding the storage, use, and export of lipids within the skeletal niche, including from both in vitro and in vivo model systems. We also highlight the numerous challenges that remain to fully appreciate the relationship of lipid turnover to skeletal homeostasis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Choline and methionine (Met) can promote energy balance and benefit liver health in transition dairy cows; however, the regulating mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we established the hepatocyte damage model by 1.5 mM NEFAs or BHBA treatment, and examined lipid  in hepatocytes. The results showed that 1.5 mM NEFAs and 1.5 mM BHBA significantly decreased the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-α as well as its target genes carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1α (CPT-1α), acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty  synthetase, and Apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100). Choline and Met upregulated the phosphorylation level of AMPK-α, which was blocked by BML (an AMPK-α inhibitor). The mRNA expression level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), CPT-1α, and ApoB100 showed a similar trend. The expressions of liver X recptoer α (LXR-α) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) were decreased by choline and Met, while only the decrease of LXR-α was blocked by BML. These findings indicate that the high-level NEFAs and BHBA weaken the lipid  by impairing the fatty  oxidation, synthesis, and transport proteins. Choline and Met regulate PPAR-α and LXR-α transcriptional activity through AMPK-α phosphorylation and regulate SREBP-1c independently of AMPK-α to promote lipid oxidation and transport in NEFAs-treated hepatocytes.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662430> Modeling of Streptococcus mutans Reveals Complex Nutrient Requirements of an Oral Pathogen.</a></h1><p> is a Gram-positive bacterium that thrives under acidic conditions and is a primary cause of tooth decay (dental caries).

The model's predictions agreed with 78.1% and 84.4% of the gene essentiality predictions from two experimental data sets. Our manually curated model is more accurate than  models generated from automated reconstruction pipelines and more complete than other manually curated models. We used iSMU to generate hypotheses about the   network.

Mammals have three GGAs (GGA1-3) that work not only at the trans-Golgi network, but also in endosomes to sort transmembrane cargo proteins such as mannose 6-phosphate receptors, sortilin, β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1, and epidermal growth factor receptor. The cytoplasmic regions of these cargoes possess motifs of acidic amino  cluster-dileucine and/or ubiquitination sites, which can be recognized by GGAs. Despite seminal investigations of the three molecules, their in vivo roles and functional redundancies, as well as relationships with a heterotetrameric adaptor protein, AP-1, which is functionally similar to GGAs were still poorly understood. Studies over the past two decades, however, discovered several new GGA cargoes, their interaction modes, and accessory proteins. These findings collectively suggest distinct and more fundamental roles of each GGA in regulating neuronal survival, lipid , and cell proliferation. This review aims to provide an update to the GGA research focusing on how GGAs became considered not only as players in the context of the TGN-endosome transport, but also as key regulators for physiologically and pathologically important phenomena.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676684>Multiple mitochondrial thioesterases have distinct tissue and substrate specificity, and CoA regulation, suggesting unique functional roles.</a></h1><p>Acyl-CoA thioesterases (Acots) hydrolyze fatty acyl-CoA esters. Acots in the mitochondrial matrix are poised to mitigate β-oxidation overload and maintain CoA availability. Several Acots associate with mitochondria, but whether they all localize to the matrix, are redundant, or have different roles is unresolved. Here, we compared the suborganellar localization, activity, expression, and regulation among mitochondrial Acots (Acot2, 7, 9, and 13) in mitochondria from multiple mouse tissues and from a model of Acot2 depletion. Acot7, 9, and 13 localized to the matrix, joining Acot2 that was previously shown to localize there. Mitochondria from heart, skeletal muscle, brown adipose tissue, and kidney robustly expressed Acot2, 9, and 13; Acot9 levels were substantially higher in brown adipose tissue and kidney mitochondria, as was activity for C4:0-CoA, a unique Acot9 substrate. In all tissues, Acot2 accounted for about half of the thioesterase activity for C14:0-CoA and C16:0-CoA. In contrast, liver mitochondria from fed and fasted mice expressed little Acot activity, which was confined to long-chain CoAs and due mainly to Acot7 and Acot13 activities. Matrix Acots occupied different functional niches, based on substrate specificity (Acot9 vs. Acot2 and 13) and strong CoA inhibition (Acot7, 9, and 13, but not Acot2). Interpreted in the context of β-oxidation, CoA inhibition would prevent Acot-mediated suppression of β-oxidation, while providing a release valve when CoA is limiting. In contrast, CoA-insensitive Acot2 could provide a constitutive syphon for long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs. These results reveal how the family of matrix Acots can mitigate β-oxidation overload and prevent CoA limitation.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673703>Glucagon-Receptor Signaling Reverses Hepatic Steatosis Independent of Leptin Receptor Expression.</a></h1><p>Glucagon (GCG) is an essential regulator of glucose and lipid  that also promotes weight loss. We have shown that glucagon-receptor (GCGR) signaling increases fatty  oxidation (FAOx) in primary hepatocytes and reduces liver triglycerides in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice; however, the mechanisms underlying this aspect of GCG biology remains unclear. Investigation of hepatic GCGR targets elucidated a potent and previously unknown induction of leptin receptor (Lepr) expression. Liver leptin signaling is known to increase FAOx and decrease liver triglycerides, similar to glucagon action. Therefore, we hypothesized that glucagon increases hepatic LEPR, which is necessary for glucagon-mediated reversal of hepatic steatosis. Eight week-old control and liver-specific, LEPR-deficient mice (LeprΔliver) were placed on a high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks and then treated with a selective GCGR agonist (IUB288) for 14 days. Liver triglycerides and gene expression were assessed in liver tissue homogenates. Administration of IUB288 in both lean and DIO mice increased hepatic Lepr isoforms a-e in acute (4h) and chronic (72h,16d) (p<0.05) settings. LeprΔliver mice displayed increased hepatic triglycerides on a chow diet alone (p<0.05), which persisted in a DIO state (p<0.001), with no differences in body weight or composition. Surprisingly, chronic administration of IUB288 in DIO control and LeprΔliver mice reduced liver triglycerides regardless of genotype (p<0.05). Together these data suggest that GCGR activation induces hepatic Lepr expression and although hepatic glucagon and leptin signaling have similar liver lipid targets, these appear to be two distinct .© Endocrine Society 2019.

Exposure to SCCPs affected expression levels of 13 genes downstream of PPARα that encode proteins associated with  of fatty . As a result, peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation, microsomal fatty  ω-oxidation, and lipogenesis were accelerated.Results of this work strongly support the conclusion that low-dose exposure to SCCPs can result in adverse outcomes in the rat model.

Theabrownin is one of the most active and abundant pigments in Pu-erh tea. Here, we show that theabrownin alters the gut microbiota in mice and humans, predominantly suppressing microbes associated with bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. Theabrownin increases the levels of ileal conjugated bile  (BAs) which, in turn, inhibit the intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling pathway, resulting in increased hepatic production and fecal excretion of BAs, reduced hepatic cholesterol, and decreased lipogenesis. The inhibition of intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling is accompanied by increased gene expression of enzymes in the alternative BA synthetic pathway, production of hepatic chenodeoxycholic , activation of hepatic FXR, and hepatic lipolysis. Our results shed light into the mechanisms behind the cholesterol- and lipid-lowering effects of Pu-erh tea, and suggest that decreased intestinal BSH microbes and/or decreased FXR-FGF15 signaling may be potential anti-hypercholesterolemia and anti-hyperlipidemia therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681434>Mining Public Toxicogenomic Data Reveals Insights and Challenges in Delineating Liver Steatosis Adverse Outcome .</a></h1><p>Exposure to chemicals contributes to the development and progression of fatty liver, or steatosis, a process characterized by abnormal accumulation of lipids within liver cells. However, lack of knowledge on how chemicals cause steatosis has prevented any large-scale assessment of the 80,000+ chemicals in current use. To address this gap, we mined a large, publicly available toxicogenomic dataset associated with 18 known steatogenic chemicals to assess responses across assays ( and ) and species (i.e., rats and humans). We identified genes that were differentially expressed (DEGs) in rat , rat , and human  studies in which rats or  primary cell lines were exposed to the chemicals at different doses and durations. Using these DEGs, we performed pathway enrichment analysis, analyzed the molecular initiating events (MIEs) of the steatosis adverse outcome pathway (AOP), and predicted metabolite changes using  network analysis. Genes indicative of oxidative stress were among the DEGs most frequently observed in the rat  studies. , a pro-fibrotic gene, was down-regulated across these chemical exposure conditions. We identified eight genes (, , , , , , , and ) and one pathway (retinol ), associated with steatogenic chemicals and whose response was conserved across the three  and  systems. Similarly, we found the predicted metabolite changes, such as increases of saturated and unsaturated fatty , conserved across the three systems. Analysis of the target genes associated with the MIEs of the current steatosis AOP did not provide a clear association between these 18 chemicals and the MIEs, underlining the multi-factorial nature of this disease. Notably, our overall analysis implicated mitochondrial toxicity as an important and overlooked MIE for chemical-induced steatosis. The integrated toxicogenomics approach to identify genes, , and metabolites based on known steatogenic chemicals, provide an important mean to assess development of AOPs and gauging the relevance of new testing strategies.Copyright © 2019 AbdulHameed, Pannala and Wallqvist.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681226>Temporal Dynamics of the Soil Metabolome and Microbiome During Simulated Anaerobic Soil Disinfestation.</a></h1><p>Significant interest exists in engineering the soil microbiome to attain suppression of soil-borne plant diseases. Anaerobic soil disinfestation (ASD) has potential as a biologically regulated disease control method; however, the role of specific metabolites and microbial community dynamics contributing to ASD mediated disease control is mostly uncharacterized. Understanding the trajectory of co-evolutionary processes leading to syntrophic generation of functional metabolites during ASD is a necessary prelude to the predictive utilization of this disease management approach. Consequently,  and microbial community profiling were used to generate highly dimensional datasets and network analysis to identify sequential transformations through aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, and anaerobic soil phases of the ASD process and distinct groups of metabolites and microorganisms linked with those stages. Transient alterations in abundance of specific microbial groups, not consistently accounted for in previous studies of the ASD process, were documented in this time-course study. Such events initially were associated with increases and subsequent diminution in highly labile metabolites conferred by the carbon input. Proliferation and dynamic compositional changes in the Firmicutes community continued throughout the anaerobic phase and was linked to temporal changes in metabolite abundance including accumulation of small chain organic , methyl sulfide compounds, hydrocarbons, and -cresol with antimicrobial properties. Novel potential modes of disease control during ASD were identified and the importance of the amendment and "community " for temporally supplying specific classes of labile compounds were revealed.Copyright © 2019 Hewavitharana, Klarer, Reed, Leisso, Poirier, Honaas, Rudell and Mazzola.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680138>Shotgun lipidomics discovered diurnal regulation of lipid  linked to insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic men.</a></h1><p>Meal timing affects  homeostasis and body weight, but how composition and timing of meals affect plasma lipidomics in humans is not well studied.We used high throughput shotgun plasma lipidomics to investigate effects of timing of carbohydrate and fat intake on lipid  and its relation to glycaemic control.29 non-diabetic men consumed (i) a high-carb test meal (MTT-HC) at 09:00 and a high-fat meal (MTT-HF) at 15:40; or (ii) MTT-HF at 09:00 and MTT-HC at 15:40.

A third of lipids showed a diurnal variation in postprandial responses to the same meal with mostly higher responses in the morning than in the afternoon. Triacylglycerols containing shorter and more saturated fatty  were enriched in the morning. SAT transcripts involved in fatty  synthesis and desaturation showed no diurnal variation.

Humans do not biosynthesise ERG, but acquire it from their diet; it exploits a specific transporter (SLC22A4) for its uptake. ERG is considered to be a nutraceutical and possible vitamin that is involved in the maintenance of health, and seems to be at too low a concentration in several diseases . Ergothioneine is thus a potentially useful dietary supplement. Present methods of commercial production rely on extraction from natural sources or on chemical synthesis. Here we describe the engineering of the baker's yeast  to produce ergothioneine by fermentation in defined media.

We also optimized the media composition using fractional factorial methods. Our optimal strategy led to a titer of 598 ± 18 mg/L ergothioneine in fed-batch culture in 1 L bioreactors.

RICD operates at the peak of the immune response to ensure T cell expansion remains in check to maintain immune homeostasis. Understanding the biochemical regulation of RICD sensitivity may provide strategies for tuning the magnitude of an effector T cell response.  reprogramming in activated T cells is not only critical for T cell differentiation and effector functions, but also influences apoptosis sensitivity. We previously demonstrated that aerobic glycolysis correlates with optimum RICD sensitivity in human effector CD8 T cells. However,  programming in CD4 T cells has not been investigated in this context. We employed a pharmacological approach to explore the effects of fatty  and glycolytic  on RICD sensitivity in primary human CD4 T cells. Blockade of fatty  synthase (FASN) with the compound C75 significantly protected CD4 effector T cells from RICD, suggesting that fatty  biosynthesis contributes to RICD sensitivity. Interestingly, sphingolipid synthesis and fatty  oxidation (FAO) were dispensable for RICD. Disruption of glycolysis did not protect CD4 T cells from RICD unless glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) enzymatic activity was targeted specifically, highlighting important differences in the  control of RICD in effector CD4 vs. CD8 T cell populations. Moreover, C75 treatment protected effector CD4 T cells derived from naïve, effector memory, and central memory T cell subsets. Decreased RICD in C75-treated CD4 T cells correlated with markedly reduced FAS ligand (FASL) induction and a Th2-skewed phenotype, consistent with RICD-resistant CD4 T cells. These findings highlight FASN as a critical  potentiator of RICD in human effector CD4 T cells.Copyright © 2019 Voss, Luthers, Pohida and Snow.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669200>Causal effects of serum metabolites on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: A Mendelian randomization study.</a></h1><p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is affected by both genetic and environmental factors.

Alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) has been reported to decrease dietary protein levels, promote intestinal health in piglets and reduce environmental pollution. However, the underlying mechanisms of AKG are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of low-protein diet supplementation of AKG on the growth performance, nitrogen , relative expression of amino  transporter genes and mTOR signalling pathway of skeletal muscle in piglets. Forty-eight piglets with an initial weight of 11.53 ± 0.04 kg were randomly divided into four groups. Each group had four replicates, and each replicate had three pigs. A low-protein (LP) diet (crude protein was 14.96%) served as the control without AKG, while 0.5%, 1.0% and 1.5% AKG were added to the LP diet for the other experimental groups. The trial period lasted for 28 days. Compared with the LP group, the LP + 1.0%A and LP + 1.5%A groups increased the growth performance (p < .05);increased the mRNA levels of amino  transporters in the duodenum, anterior jejunum and posterior jejunum (p < .05); and reduced faecal nitrogen and urine nitrogen emissions (p < .05). They also showed greater mRNA levels and phosphorylated protein levels for S6 kinase beta (S6K) (p < .05), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (p < .05) and 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) (p < .05) in skeletal muscle. An LP diet supplemented with AKG activated the mTOR signalling and promoted the ability of the small intestine to absorb protein, thereby increasing protein deposition.

In addition, Fa6 has increased ferulic  consumption and a higher conversion rate, suggesting that the mutation affects aromatic  of this species. Transcriptome analysis of the evolutionary mutant on ferulic  revealed a distinct gene expression profile compared to the wild type. Further analysis of this mutant and the parent strain provided the first experimental confirmation that A. niger converts coniferyl alcohol to ferulic .The evolutionary adaptive A. niger mutant Fa6 has beneficial mutations that increase the tolerance, conversion rate and uptake of ferulic .This study demonstrates that evolutionary adaptation is a powerful tool to modify microorganisms towards increased tolerance to harsh conditions, which is beneficial for various industrial applications.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669189>Linking internal dosimetries of the propyl  series in rats and humans using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling.</a></h1><p>The  series approach has successfully linked internal dosimetries of metabolically related compounds reducing cost and time for chemical risk assessments. Here, we developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model in rats and humans for the propyl  series including propyl acetate, 1-propanol, propionaldehyde, and propionic . Manufacturers use these compounds as organic solvents and intermediates during chemical synthesis. Public exposures can occur through using consumer products containing propyl compounds like cosmetics, aerosol sprays, or foods, and occupational exposures can occur at manufacturing facilities. To develop the PBPK model, we measured in vitro  of propyl acetate in blood and liver S9 fractions. We measured concentrations of propyl compounds in blood following intravenous (iv) infusion of C-propanol or C-propionic  and closed chamber inhalation exposures to propyl acetate or propanol in rats. Using these studies and other published data, we modified an existing PBPK model for the butyl  series to simulate time course concentrations of propyl compounds in rats and humans. Consistent with measured in vitro and in vivo data, the optimized propyl series model predicts rapid clearance of propyl acetate, higher concentrations of propanol in blood from propyl acetate inhalation compared to propanol inhalation in rats but not in humans, and low concentrations of propionic  in blood from exposures to propyl acetate or propanol. Regulators can use this model as a tool for propyl compound risk assessment by linking internal dosimetries under various exposure scenarios.Copyright © 2019.

It's unknown whether long-term consumption of maleic -modified starch is harmful to the human. However, many studies have indicated that maleic  causes renal tubular damage in animal models, even as the associated  remain unclear. Sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra (SWATH) is the most innovative of the label-free quantitative technologies, which have better quantification performance. Therefore, SWATH technology was used to investigate the effect of maleic  on rat kidney proteome in this study.SD rats were treated with 0 mg/kg (control), 6 mg/kg (low-dose), 10 mg/kg (medium-dose) and 60 mg/kg (high-dose) of maleic . After kidney protein extraction, 28% SDS-PAGE was used, followed by in-gel digestion and desalting. Next, the samples were analyzed with ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with Q-TOF MS, and data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and SWATH technology were also used. The gene ontology and pathway analysis were accomplished. Ultimately, these protein biomarkers were validated by using scheduled high-resolution multiple reaction monitoring (sMRM ).Comparisons of the control group with the other three groups revealed that 95, 130, and 103 proteins were expressed at significantly different levels from in the control group in the low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively. According to the gene ontology analysis, the major processes that these proteins were involved in were  processes, biological regulation, cellular processes, and responses to stimuli; the major functions these proteins were involved in were binding, hydrolase activity, catalytic activity, and oxidoreductase activity; and the major cellular components they were involved in were the cytoplasm, extracellular region, membrane, and mitochondria. According to the KEGG pathway analysis, these proteins were involved in 35 , 5 of which, including the carbohydrate , folate biosynthesis, renal tubular resorption, amino  , and Ras signaling , are discussed in this study. Ultimately, 19 proteins involved in 12 important  were validated by sMRM .It was demonstrated that maleic  caused insufficient energy production, which might lead to a decrease in the activity of the sodium-potassium ATP pump and hydrogen ion ATP pump, which could have in turn caused renal tubular resorption and hydrogen ion regulation to be blocked, thus leading to the accumulation of hydrogen ions in the renal tubules, which would then result in renal tubular acidification followed finally by Fanconi syndrome.This article is protected by copyright.

EPA-pPE has been reported to exhibit numerous distinctive bioactivities. However, the digestion, absorption, and  characteristics of EPA-pPE in vivo are not clear, which restrict the molecular mechanism analysis related to its distinctive activities. The aim of the present study was to illustrate the digestion, absorption, and  characteristics of EPA-pPE by lipid analysis in serum, intestinal wall, and content after oral administration of EPA-pPE emulsion. Results showed the EPA percentage of total fatty  in serum was increasing over time, with two peaks at 5 and 10 h by 1.89 ± 0.2 and 2.58 ± 0.27, respectively, and then fell from 1.89 ± 0.17 at 10 h to 1.35 ± 0.16 at 16 h. In small intestinal content, EPA-pPE was hydrolyzed to lyso-phospholipids and EPA by phospholipases A2 and the vinyl ether bond was retained at the sn-1 position. The released EPA could be quickly taken up into the enterocytes and enter circulation. The comparison of simulated digestion in vitro showed that the distinct digestion and absorption process of EPA-pPE was a unique phenomenon. EPA could be retained in serum at a high level for a substantial period of time, which suggested that EPA-pPE was not just a short-lived circulating molecule.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683034>Integrated network pharmacology analysis and serum metabolomics to reveal the cognitive improvement effect of Bushen Tiansui Formula on Alzheimer's disease.</a></h1><p>Bushen Tiansui Formula (BSTSF) is a traditional Chinese medicine formula used clinically to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) for many years. Previously, we have partially elucidated the mechanisms involved in the therapeutic effects of BSTSF on AD. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear.The aim of this study was to further investigate the therapeutic effects of BSTSF on AD using an integrated strategy of network pharmacology and serum metabolomics.The rat models of AD were established using Aβ1-42 injection, and morris water maze test was used to evaluate the efficacy of BSTSF on AD. Next, network pharmacology analysis was applied to identify the active compounds and target genes, which might be responsible for the effect of BSTSF. Then, a metabolomics strategy has been developed to find the possible significant serum metabolites and  pathway induced by BSTSF. Additionally, two parts of the results were integrated to confirm each other.The results of the network pharmacology analysis showed 37 compounds and 64 potential target genes related to the treatment of AD with BSTSF. The functional enrichment analysis indicated that the potential mechanism was mainly associated with the tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase B signaling pathway. Based on metabolomics, 78 differential endogenous metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers related to the BSTSF for treating AD. These metabolites were mainly involved in the relevant  of linoleic  , α-linolenic  , glycerophospholipid , tryptophan , and arginine and proline . These findings were partly consistent with the findings of the network pharmacology analysis.In conclusion, our results solidly supported and enhanced out current understanding of the therapeutic effects of BSTSF on AD. Meanwhile, our work revealed that the proposed network pharmacology-integrated metabolomics strategy was a powerful means for identifying active components and mechanisms contributing to the pharmacological effects of traditional Chinese medicine.Copyright © 2019.

Tumor-initiating cells are isolated from cell lines and clinical samples based on features such as sphere formation in stem cell medium and expression of TIC markers, typically a set of outer membrane proteins and certain transcription factors. Although both bulk tumor cells and TICs show an adaptive  plasticity, TIC  is thought to differ and likely in a tumor-specific and growth condition-dependent pattern. In the context of some common solid tumor diseases, we here review reports on how TIC isolation methods and markers associate with  features, with some focus on oxidative , including fatty  and lipid . These have emerged as significant factors in TIC phenotypes, and in tumor biology as a whole. Other sections address mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics in TICs, and the influence of the tumor microenvironment. Further elucidation of the complex biology of TICs and their  will require advanced methodologies.</p></html>
