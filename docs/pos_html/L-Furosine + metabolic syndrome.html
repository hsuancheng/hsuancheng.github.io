In the Young Finn's Study, BCAA and, to a lesser extent, the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and  were associated with insulin resistance (IR) in men but not in women, whereas the gluconeogenic amino acids alanine, glutamine, or glycine, and several other amino acids (i.e. histidine, arginine, and tryptophan) did not show an association with IR. Obesity may track more strongly than  and diabetes with elevated BCAA. In a study of 1302 people aged 40-79; higher levels of BCAA tracked with older age, male sex, and , as well as with obesity, cardiovascular risk, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and uric acid. Medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines, by-products of mitochondrial catabolism of BCAAs, as well as branched-chain keto acids and the BCAA themselves distinguished obese people having versus not having features of IR, and in a study of 898 patients with essential hypertension, the BCAA and  and phenylalanine were associated with  and impaired fasting glucose. In a meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies, elevations in BCAA and, to a lesser extent, in alanine tracked with IR, whereas higher levels of glutamine and glycine were associated with lesser likelihood of IR. Given these associations with IR, it is not surprising that a number of studies have shown higher BCAA levels in people with and prior to development of type 2 diabetes (T2D), although this has particularly been shown in Caucasian and Asian ethnic groups while not appearing to occur in African Americans. Similarly, higher BCAA levels track with cardiovascular disease. [Figure: see text] The metabolism of BCAA involves two processes: (i) a reversible process catalysed by a branched-chain aminotransferase (BCAT), either cytosolic or mitochondrial, requiring pyridoxal to function as an amino group carrier, by which the BCAA with 2-ketoglutarate produce a branched-chain keto acid plus glutamate; and (ii) the irreversible mitochondrial process catalysed by branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) leading to formation of acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA), propionyl-CoA, and 2-methylbutyryl-CoA from leucine, valine, and isoleucine, respectively, which enter the tricarboxylic acid (Krebs) cycle as acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and 2-methylbutyryl-CoA, respectively, leading to ATP formation. The BCAA stimulate secretion of both insulin and glucagon and, when given orally, of both glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), with oral administration leading to greater and more prolonged insulin and glucagon secretion. Insulin may particularly reduce BCAA turnover to a greater extent than that of other amino acids, and decreases the appearance and increases the uptake of amino acids. However, older studies of the effect of glucose or insulin on BCAA concentrations and rates of leucine appearance and oxidation showed no reduction in T2D, although the higher baseline levels of BCAA in obesity have long been recognized. Impaired function of BCAT and BCKDH has been posited, either as a primary genetic abnormality or due to effects of elevated fatty acids, proinflammatory cytokines, or insulin levels with consequent accumulation of branched-chain keto acids and metabolites such as diacylglycerol and ceramide, potentially contributing to the development of further insulin resistance, and decreased skeletal muscle BCAT and BCKDH expression has been shown in people with diabetes, supporting this concept. A Mendelian randomization study used measured variation in genes involved in BCAA metabolism to test the hypothesis of a causal effect of modifiable exposure on IR, showing that variants in protein phosphatase, Mg /Mn dependent 1K (PPM1K), a gene encoding the mitochondrial phosphatase activating the BCKDH complex, are associated with T2D, but another such study suggested that genetic variations associated with IR are causally related to higher BCAA levels. Another hypothesis involves the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which is activated by BCAA, as well as by insulin and glucose via cellular ATP availability. If this is the relevant pathway, BCAA overload may cause insulin resistance by activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), as well as by leading to increases in acylcarnitines, with mTOR seen in this scenario as a central signal of cross-talk between the BCAA and insulin. At this point, whether whole-body or tissue-specific BCAA metabolism is increased or decreased in states of insulin-resistant obesity and T2D is uncertain. Insulin action in the hypothalamus induces but overfeeding decreases hepatic BCKDH, leading to the concept that hypothalamic insulin resistance impairs BCAA metabolism in obesity and diabetes, so that plasma BCAAs may be markers of hypothalamic insulin action rather than direct mediators of changes in IR. A way to address this may be to understand the effects of changes in diet and other interventions on BCAA, as well as on IR and T2D. In an animal model, lowering dietary BCAA increased energy expenditure and improved insulin sensitivity. Two large human population studies showed an association of estimated dietary BCAA intake with T2D risk, although another population study showed higher dietary BCAA to be associated with lower T2D risk. Ethnic differences, reflecting underlying differences in genetic variants, may be responsible for such differences. In the study of Asghari et al. in the current issue of the Journal of Diabetes, BCAA intake was associated with the development of subsequent IR. Studies of bariatric surgery suggest lower basal and post-insulin infusion BCAA levels are associated with greater insulin sensitivity, with reductions in BCAA not seen with weight loss per se with gastric band procedures, but occurring after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, an intervention that may have  benefits over and above those from reduction in body weight. The gut microbiota may be important for the supply of the BCAA to mammalian hosts, either by de novo biosynthesis or by modifying nutrient absorption. A final fascinating preliminary set of observations is that of the effects of empagliflozin on metabolomics; evidence of increased Krebs cycle activation and of higher levels of BCAA metabolites, such as acylcarnitines, suggests that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition may, to some extent, involve BCAA metabolism. Certainly, we do not yet have a full understanding of these complex associations. However, the suggestion of multiple roles of BCAA in the development of IR promises to be important and to lead to the development of novel effective T2D therapies.© 2018 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29335257>Staphylococcal Superantigens Use LAMA2 as a Coreceptor To Activate T Cells.</a></h2><p>Canonical Ag-dependent TCR signaling relies on activation of the src-family  kinase LCK. However, staphylococcal superantigens can trigger TCR signaling by activating an alternative pathway that is independent of LCK and utilizes a Gα11-containing G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) leading to PLCβ activation. The molecules linking the superantigen to GPCR signaling are unknown. Using the ligand-receptor capture technology LRC-TriCEPS, we identified LAMA2, the α2 subunit of the extracellular matrix protein laminin, as the coreceptor for staphylococcal superantigens. Complementary binding assays (ELISA, pull-downs, and surface plasmon resonance) provided direct evidence of the interaction between staphylococcal enterotoxin E and LAMA2. Through its G4 domain, LAMA2 mediated the LCK-independent T cell activation by these toxins. Such a coreceptor role of LAMA2 involved a GPCR of the calcium-sensing receptor type because the selective antagonist NPS 2143 inhibited superantigen-induced T cell activation in vitro and delayed the effects of toxic shock  in vivo. Collectively, our data identify LAMA2 as a target of antagonists of staphylococcal superantigens to treat toxic shock .Copyright © 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25937635>An integrated metabonomic and proteomic study on Kidney-Yin Deficiency  patients with diabetes mellitus in China.</a></h2><p>To investigate specific changes in metabolites and proteins of Kidney-Yin Deficiency  (KYDS) patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) in China.KYDS (n=29) and non-KYDS (n=23) patients with DM were recruited for this study.

Green tea catechins (GTCs) may possess potent anticancer and chemopreventive properties for a number of different malignancies, including liver cancer. Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are key mechanisms through which GTCs prevent the development of neoplasms, and they also exert cancer chemopreventive effects by modulating several signaling transduction and  pathways. Furthermore, GTCs are considered to be useful for the prevention of obesity- and -related carcinogenesis by improving  disorders. Several interventional trials in humans have shown that GTCs may ameliorate  abnormalities and prevent the development of precancerous lesions. The purpose of this article is to review the key mechanisms by which GTCs exert chemopreventive effects in liver carcinogenesis, focusing especially on their ability to inhibit receptor  kinases and improve  abnormalities.

Increased plasma FFA level is an important cause of obesity-associated insulin resistance. Over-activated ERK is closely related with FFA release from adipose tissues in patients with type 2 diabetes. Nevertheless, there are no effective strategies to lower plasma FFA level. Low-power laser irradiation (LPLI) has been reported to regulate multiple biological processes. However, whether LPLI could ameliorate  disorders and the molecular mechanisms involved remain unknown. In this study, we first demonstrated that LPLI suppresses excessive lipolysis of insulin-resistant adipocytes by activating  kinases-1(Dok1)/ERK/PPARγ pathway. Our data showed that LPLI inhibits ERK phosphorylation through the activation of Dok1, resulting in decreased phospho-PPARγ level. Non-phosphorylated PPARγ maintains in nucleus to promote the expression of adipogenic genes, reversing excessive lipolysis in insulin-resistant adipocytes. In summary, the present research highlights the important roles of Dok1/ERK/PPARγ pathway in lowering FFA release from adipocytes, and our research extends the knowledge of the biological effects induced by LPLI.Copyright © 2015.

Figure 1 shows the progression from the discovery of the first hormone secretin when Bayliss and Starling instilled acid into the denervated duodenum of a dog and observed the flow of pancreatic secretions and said this must be due to a hormone which is a word derived from the Greek to “excite”. Subsequently gastrin was identified by Edkins as a potent gastric acid secretogogue in 1905 and Zollinger and Ellison in 1955 recognized it as the principal culprit for the Zollinger Ellison  due to gastric acid overproduction. These discoveries led to a focus on pancreatic and gastric secretion. In 1925 Oberg and Ivy discovered CCK which contracted the gallbladder and it took eons to recognize a clinical  associated with gastric hypersecretion by Jens Rehfeld. Meanwhile Verner and Morrison discovered VIP in 1972 which identified the culprit behind the watery diarrhea , hypokalemia acidosis  (WDHHA) . A flurry of activity in the 60s and 70s led to the discovery of a host of peptides including gastric Inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) by John Brown who renamed it as glucose dependent insulin releasing peptide which has conferred upon it much greater notoriety. Advances in this field were catapulted with the development of radioimmunoassay by Berson and Yalow in 1959 led to the ability of quantification of hormones in the circulation in picomolar amounts and the application of the assay to glucagon by Roger Unger. The advances in immunological techniques and protein chemistry led to intensive progress with the purification and sequencing of a host of other peptides such as motilin, gastric inhibitory peptide somatostatin, leptin and ghrelin. Thus, grew the interest in physiologic mechanisms of action of these hormones digestive glandular secretion, gastrointestinal motility, visceral blood flow and tissue growth and proliferation as well as dedifferentiation of cells into their malignant counterparts. This era was recognized for the discovery of molecules without known biological function such as pancreatic polypeptide (PP), physiologic activity without known peptide regulators, hormones with dual function or as in the case of somatostatin discovered by Schally and Guillemin which was the second peptide captured for a role in peptide therapy. The ability to derive molecules from the parent molecule and its precursor enhanced the capacity to exploit its actions in controlling physiology as a virtual inhibitor of all secretions, to radiolabel the peptide in the development of imaging techniques such as the Octreoscan and the formation of long-acting analogs cable of restricting cell growth and proliferation. Further refinements have seen the evolution of peptide receptor radiotherapy (PRRT) and more potent Gallium DOTATOC and TATE scanning. This age has been referred to as Theranostics by Baum to reflect on the diagnostic capabilities as well as the therapeutic potential. The original recognition of Karzinoid as a tumor of the GI tract in 1907 led to the description by Feyrter of the cell type as Helle Zellen or transparent cells because of their characteristics gave birth to the recognition of the LC cell which is the grandfather of a far-reaching neuroendocrine tumor potential and expanded the role of the gut from pancreas and intestinal tract to a gut brain axis from which a number of disorders have blossomed. This theranostic era has witnessed the implications of  kinase inhibitors, MTOR involvement in tumor growth and therapy and these last few years have been party to a plethora of new discoveries of old hormones. New discoveries of new hormones and new discoveries of new functions for older peptides and new discoveries of actions outside of the GI tract for established GI hormones. Endocrine tumors of the gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) axis consist of cells that are capable of amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation and therefore have been named APUDomas (1). The morphologic similarity of the APUD cells suggested a common embryologic origin, which was believed to be the neural crest but was later revised to include the neuroectoderm or, in the case of endocrine cells, the dorsal placoderm. However, most investigators agree that these tumors should be classified according to their secretory products (i.e., carcinoid, gastrinoma, insulinoma, somatostatinomas, glucagonoma, vasoactive intestinal peptide [VIPoma] and pancreatic polypeptide [PPoma] (2) (3) (4). Before presenting their clinical characteristics we will briefly review the currently held views on the embryologic origin of these cells and the factors regulating their growth, differentiation and apoptosis, that serve to maintain homeostatic balance. We will also indicate the derangements that result in tumor formation.Copyright © 2000-2019, MDText.com, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25425531>Expanding the clinical spectrum of ocular anomalies in Noonan : Axenfeld-anomaly in a child with PTPN11 mutation.</a></h2><p>Ocular anomalies have been frequently reported in Noonan .

In addition to insulin secretion, hepatic insulin clearance regulates the homeostatic level of insulin that is required to reach peripheral insulin target tissues to elicit proper insulin action. Receptor-mediated insulin uptake followed by its degradation constitutes the basic mechanism of insulin clearance. Upon its phosphorylation by the insulin receptor  kinase, carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) takes part in the insulin-insulin receptor complex to increase the rate of its endocytosis and targeting to the degradation pathways. This review summarizes how this process is regulated and how it is associated with insulin-degrading enzyme in the liver. It also discusses the physiological implications of impaired hepatic insulin clearance: Whereas reduced insulin clearance cooperates with increased insulin secretion to compensate for insulin resistance, it can also cause hepatic insulin resistance. Because chronic hyperinsulinemia stimulates hepatic de novo lipogenesis, impaired insulin clearance also causes hepatic steatosis. Thus impaired insulin clearance can underlie the link between hepatic insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. Delineating these regulatory pathways should lead to building more effective therapeutic strategies against .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28728509>Do adverse pregnancy outcomes contribute to accelerated cardiovascular events seen in young women with systemic lupus erythematosus?</a></h2><p>Cardiovascular events (CVEs) are prevalent in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and it is the young women who are disproportionately at risk. The risk factors for accelerated cardiovascular disease remain unclear, with multiple studies producing conflicting results. In this paper, we aim to address both traditional and SLE-specific risk factors postulated to drive the accelerated vascular disease in this cohort. We also discuss the more recent hypothesis that adverse pregnancy outcomes in the form of maternal-placental  and resultant preterm delivery could potentially contribute to the CVEs seen in young women with SLE who have fewer traditional cardiovascular risk factors. The pathophysiology of how placental-mediated vascular insufficiency and hypoxia (with the secretion of placenta-like growth factor (PlGF) and soluble fms--like kinase-1 (sFlt-1), soluble endoglin (sEng) and other placental factors) work synergistically to damage the vascular endothelium is discussed.

Researchers have been interested in identifying active harmless compounds, as many insulin-sensitizing drugs have shown unwanted side-effects. It has been demonstrated that anthocyanins and one of their representative metabolites, protocatechuic acid (PCA), ameliorate hyperglycemia, and insulin sensitivity. This study investigated the mechanism of action of PCA responsible for the glucose uptake upregulation.In human visceral adipocytes, PCA stimulated insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)  phosphorylation (+40% with respect to untreated cells) and the downstream events, i.e. phosphoinositide 3-kinase binding to IRS-1 and Akt phosphorylation (+100%, +180%, respectively, with respect to untreated cells). The insulin-like activity of PCA seemed to be mediated by insulin receptor since by inhibiting its autophosphorylation, the PCA effects were completely abolished. Furthermore, PCA was able to activate adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, a serine/threonine kinase whose activation elicits insulin-sensitizing effects.This study showed that PCA stimulates the insulin signaling pathway in human adipocytes increasing GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake. Decreasing insulin resistance is a most desirable aim to be reached for an effective therapeutic/preventive action against  and type 2 diabetes. Identifying specific food/food components able to improve glucose metabolism can offer an attractive, novel, and economical strategy.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Recent studies indicate that chronic low-grade inflammation (CLGI) plays a key role in  deterioration in the obese population.

Since CLGI is associated with diabetes, obesity, and , present studies determined the role of Jak3 in development of such conditions. Our data show that loss of Jak3 resulted in increased body weight, basal systemic CLGI, compromised glycemic homeostasis, hyperinsulinemia, and early symptoms of liver steatosis. Lack of Jak3 also resulted in exaggerated symptoms of  by western high-fat diet. Mechanistically, Jak3 was essential for reduced expression and activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in murine intestinal mucosa and human intestinal epithelial cells where Jak3 interacted with and activated p85, the regulatory subunit of the PI3K, through  phosphorylation of adapter protein insulin receptor substrate (IRS1). These interactions resulted in activation of PI3K-Akt axis, which was essential for reduced TLR expression and TLR associated NFκB activation. Collectively, these results demonstrate the essential role of Jak3 in promoting mucosal tolerance through suppressed expression and limiting activation of TLRs thereby preventing intestinal and systemic CLGI and associated obesity and MetS.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29076908>AIDS-Related Central Nervous System Toxoplasmosis With Increased 18F-Fluoroethyl- Amino Acid PET Uptake Due to LAT1/2 Expression of Inflammatory Cells.</a></h2><p>We report the case of a 40-year-old woman with a progressive right-sided hemiparesis.

Implications in Lesch-Nyhan disease pathogenesis.</a></h2><p>Neurological manifestations in Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) are attributed to the effect of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) deficiency on the nervous system development. HPRT deficiency causes the excretion of increased amounts of hypoxanthine into the extracellular medium and we hypothesized that HPRT deficiency related to hypoxanthine excess may then lead, directly or indirectly, to transcriptional aberrations in a variety of genes essential for the function and development of striatal progenitor cells. We have examined the effect of hypoxanthine excess on the differentiation of neurons in the well-established human NTERA-2 cl.D1 (NT2/D1) embryonic carcinoma neurogenesis model. NT2/D1 cells differentiate along neuroectodermal lineages after exposure to retinoic acid (RA). Hypoxanthine effects on RA-differentiation were examined by the changes on the expression of various transcription factor genes essential to neuronal differentiation and by the changes in  hydroxylase (TH), dopamine, adenosine and serotonin receptors (DRD, ADORA, HTR). We report that hypoxanthine excess deregulate WNT4, from Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and engrailed homeobox 1 gene and increased TH and dopamine DRD1, adenosine ADORA2A and serotonin HTR7 receptors, whose over expression characterize early neuro-developmental processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28117012>Current Status and Perspectives Regarding the Therapeutic Potential of Targeting EGFR Pathway by Curcumin in Lung Cancer.</a></h2><p>Lung cancer is among the leading causes of cancer-related-death. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer. More than 70% of NSCLC patients have locally advanced or metastatic disease in diagnosis stage, which are then being treated with platinum-based chemotherapy or epidermal-growthfactor- receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Several molecules which target multiple ErbB receptors and EGFR have been developed, including gefitinib and erlotinib. Identification of novel agents with less toxicity is warranted. Several interesting data have been reported about the antitumor activity of curcumin in several tumors, including lung, breast and colorectal cancers. In particular, a recent phase I trial evaluated the activity of curcumin in combination with FOLFOX chemotherapy in patients with inoperable colorectal cancer. They showed that curcumin added benefit in subsets of patients when administered with FOLFOX and was well-tolerated chemotherapy adjunct. Another ongoing trial is now investigating the beneficial effects of curcumin plus gefitinib or erlotinib for EGFRmutant NSCLC. Improved understanding of molecular mechanisms behind resistance to EGFR  kinase inhibitors suggests the importance of a genotype-guided approach to therapy and inhibition of parallel and downstream pathways, using agents which target heat-shock-protein-90, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and PI3K/mTOR pathway. The aim of the current review is to give an overview of the possible molecular mechanisms of curcumin in the preclinical and clinical investigations in solid tumors, with particular emphasis on its combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in lung cancers.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28709739>Structured lifestyle intervention in patients with the  mitigates oxidative stress but fails to improve measures of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy.</a></h2><p>To assess the role of oxidative stress in mediating adverse outcomes in  (MetS) and resultant cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN), and to evaluate the effects of lifestyle interventions on measures of oxidative stress and CAN in subjects with MetS.Pilot study in 25 non-diabetic subjects with MetS (age 49±10years, 76% females) participating in a 24-week lifestyle intervention (supervised aerobic exercise/Mediterranean diet), and 25 age-matched healthy controls. CAN was assessed by cardiovascular reflex tests, heart rate variability (HRV) and PET imaging with sympathetic analog [C] meta-hydroxyephedrine ([C]HED). Specific oxidative fingerprints were measured by liquid-chromatography/mass-spectrometry (LC/MS).At baseline, MetS subjects had significantly higher oxidative stress markers [3-nitrotyrosine (234±158 vs. 54±47μmol/mol ), ortho- (59±38 vs. 18±10μmol/molphenylalanine, all P<0.0001], and impaired HRV at rest and during deep breathing (P=0.039 and P=0.021 respectively) compared to controls. Twenty-four-week lifestyle intervention significantly reduced all oxidative stress markers (all P<0.01) but did not change any of the CAN measures.Subjects with MetS present with signs of CAN and increased oxidative stress in the absence of diabetes. The 24-week lifestyle intervention was effective in ameliorating oxidative stress, but did not improve measures of CAN.

Pregnant rats were fed with a control diet or a low protein diet (LPD). Male offspring rats received a LPD during gestation, lactation, and until they were 60 days old (MM group), a late LPD that began after weaning (CM), or a LPD administrated only during the gestation-lactation period followed by a control diet (MC). On day 60, blood was collected and the liver was dissected out. We found a decrease in MM rats' total body (p < 0.001) and liver (p < 0.05) weight. These and CM rats showed obvious liver dysfunction reflected by the increase in serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGOT) (MM p < 0.001) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) (MM and CM p < 0.001) enzymes, and liver content of cholesterol (MM and CM p < 0.001) and triglycerides (MM p < 0.01; CM p < 0.001), in addition to what we saw by histology. Liver dysfunction was also shown by the increase in gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) (MM, MC, and CM p < 0.001) and GST-pi1 (MM and CM p < 0.001, MC p < 0.05) expression levels. MC rats showed the lowest increment in GST-pi1 expression (MC vs. MM; p < 0.001, MC vs. CM; p < 0.01). ROS production (MM, CM, and MC: p < 0.001), lipid peroxidation (MM, CM, and MC p < 0.001), content of carbonyl groups in liver proteins (MM and CM p < 0.001, MC p < 0.01), and total antioxidant capacity (MM, CM, and MC p < 0.001) were increased in the liver of all groups of malnourished animals. However, MM rats showed the highest increment. We found higher TNF-α (MM and CM p < 0.001), and IL-6 (MM and CM p < 0.001) serum levels and TGF-β liver content (MM p < 0.01; CM p < 0.05), in MM and CM groups, while MC rats reverted the values to normal levels. Pro-survival signaling pathways mediated by  or serine/threonine kinases (pAKT) (MM and CM p < 0.001; MC p < 0.01) and extrasellular signal-regulated kinase (pERKs) (MM p < 0.01; CM p < 0.05) appeared to be activated in the liver of all groups of malnourished rats, suggesting the presence of cells resistant to apoptosis which would become cancerous.

Protein  phosphatase, non-receptor type 1 (PTPN1) located on chromosome 20q13, could negatively regulate insulin and leptin signaling. In this study, we determined the association of PTPN1 polymorphisms with BC risk.We analyzed the distribution of 11 selected PTPN1 single nucleotide polymorphisms in Chinese female patients with BC (n = 953) and healthy controls (n = 963) based on a multicenter case-control study. The association of PTPN1 genotypes and haplotypes frequencies with BC risk were determined by logistic regression analysis. Analyses were further stratified by body mass index (BMI), waist-hip rate (WHR), diabetes mellitus history, and fasting plasma glucose level. The eQTL (expression Quantitative Trait Loci) analysis for PTPN1 was conducted by GTEx database.There were significant differences between BC cases and control groups in menopausal status, number of births, and BMI. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs3215684, rs3787345, rs718049, and rs718050) decreased overall BC risk, and other seven SNPs showed no significant association with BC risk. In multivariate analysis, BMI and rs3215684 DT + DD genotype were identified as independent risk factors for BC, and mutated genotypes of rs3215684 were correlated with increased PTPN1 expression. There are no haplotypes showed different frequencies between cases and controls. In the stratified analysis, rs2206656 showed a significant association with decreased BC risk in the subgroup of BMI ≤ 24 kg/m  , while rs3215684 and rs718049 showed lower BC risk in the subgroup of WHR > 0.85. Seven SNPs showed lower BC risk in the subgroup with diabetes mellitus history and/or fasting plasma glucose level ≥ 7 mM, while rs754118 decreased BC risk in the subgroup of fasting plasma glucose level < 7 mM.Our findings suggest that PTPN1 SNPs associated with BC susceptibility in Chinese females, which also suggested a novel mechanism between obesity, diabetes mellitus, and BC risk.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31026810>Thyrotoxicosis with concomitant thyroid cancer.</a></h2><p>Thyrotoxicosis with concomitant thyroid cancer is rare and poorly recognized, which may result in delayed diagnosis, inappropriate treatment, and even poor prognosis. To provide a comprehensive guidance for clinicians, the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of this challenging setting were systematically reviewed. According to literatures available, the etiologies of thyrotoxicosis with concomitant thyroid cancer were categorized into Graves' disease with concurrent differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) or medullary thyroid cancer, Marine-Lenhart  with coexisting DTC, Plummer's disease with concomitant DTC, amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis with concomitant DTC, central hyperthyroidism with coexisting DTC, hyperfunctioning metastases of DTC and others. The underlying causal mechanisms linking thyrotoxicosis and thyroid cancer were elucidated. Medical history, biochemical assessments, radioiodine uptake, anatomic and  imaging, and ultrasonography guided fine-needle aspiration combined with pathological examinations were found to be critical for precise diagnosis. Surgery remains a mainstay in both tumor elimination and control of thyrotoxicosis, while anti-thyroid drugs, beta-blockers, 131I, glucocorticoids, plasmapheresis, somatostatin analogs, dopamine agonists, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and  kinase inhibitors should also be appropriately utilized as needed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26808974>Alterations in Lipid and Inositol Metabolisms in Two Dopaminergic Disorders.</a></h2><p>Serum metabolite profiling can be used to identify pathways involved in the pathogenesis of and potential biomarkers for a given disease. Both restless legs  (RLS) and Parkinson`s disease (PD) represent movement disorders for which currently no blood-based biomarkers are available and whose pathogenesis has not been uncovered conclusively. We performed unbiased serum metabolite profiling in search of signature  changes for both diseases.456 metabolites were quantified in serum samples of 1272 general population controls belonging to the KORA cohort, 82 PD cases and 95 RLS cases by liquid-phase chromatography and gas chromatography separation coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Genetically determined metabotypes were calculated using genome-wide genotyping data for the 1272 general population controls.After stringent quality control, we identified decreased levels of long-chain (polyunsaturated) fatty acids of individuals with PD compared to both RLS (PD vs. RLS: p = 0.0001 to 5.80x10-9) and general population controls (PD vs. KORA: p = 6.09x10-5 to 3.45x10-32). In RLS, inositol metabolites were increased specifically (RLS vs. KORA: p = 1.35x10-6 to 3.96x10-7). The impact of dopaminergic drugs was reflected in changes in the phenylalanine//dopamine metabolism observed in both individuals with RLS and PD.A first discovery approach using serum metabolite profiling in two dopamine-related movement disorders compared to a large general population sample identified significant alterations in the polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism in PD and implicated the inositol metabolism in RLS.

The polysaccharides are the main active components in H. epimedii. The aim of this study is to discover the therapeutic effect and  mechanism of H. epimedii polysaccharides against CFS.The polysaccharide conjugates named HEP2-a were isolated from the leaves of H. epimedii using a water extraction method, and the general physicochemical properties of HEP2-a were analysed. In addition, a CFS rat model was established, and then, urinary metabonomic studies were performed using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) in combination with multivariate statistical analysis.The physicochemical properties revealed that HEP2-a had an average molecular weight of 13.6×10Da and consisted of mannose (4.41%), rhamnose (5.43%), glucose (31.26%), galactose (27.07%), arabinose (23.43%), and galacturonic acid (8.40%). The amino acids in HEP2-a include glutamate, cysteine, leucine, , lysine, and histidine. Molecular morphology studies revealed many highly curled spherical particles with diameters of 5-10µm in solids and 100-200nm for particles in water. Five metabolites in the HEP2-a group were oppositely and significantly changed compared to the CFS model group.Two  pathways were identified as significant  pathways involved with HEP2-a. The therapeutic effects of HEP2-a on CFS were partially due to the restoration of these disturbed pathways.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The aim of this study was to compare the breast milk amino acid profiles of obese and normal weight (control) breast-feeding mothers.Fifty obese and 50 control breast-feeding mothers were enrolled. Age and parity were similar in both groups. Breast milk samples were collected at the end of the first month of lactation. Free amino acid (FAA) concentrations in breast milk were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Comparisons between groups were performed using a two-tailed paired t test.We analyzed 45 breast milk samples from each group. Body mass index was 34.3 ± 3.9 kg/m(2) in the obese group and 21.6 ± 1.4 kg/m(2) in the control group (P < 10(-4)). BCAA concentrations were higher in breast milk of obese mothers (95.5 ± 38.2 μM versus 79.8 ± 30.9 μM; P = 0.037), as was  concentration (13.8 ± 7.1 μM versus 10.6 ± 5.2 μM; P = 0.016).The mature breast milk of obese mothers contained 20% more BCAA and 30% more  than breast milk of control mothers.

This research aimed to study the changes in whole metabolites before and after exenatide treatment in overweight/obese PCOS patients to gain a better understanding of exenatide for the treatment of PCOS.Sixty-seven women, including 32 with PCOS and 35 age-matched controls, were recruited. The metabolite changes were detected with nontargeted gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (NTGC-MS) before and after exenatide treatment, and changes in clinical biochemical characteristics were also observed.A total of 62 metabolites were differentially expressed between the healthy and PCOS groups, and 31 differentially expressed metabolites were detected before and after exenatide treatment. Abnormal lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism were the main  disorders. Exenatide improved lipid and amino acid metabolism, especially amino acid metabolites. Three types of branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine and isoleucine), two types of aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine and ) and lysine are important potential metabolites for the therapeutic efficacy of exenatide. Many abnormal  disorders are related to insulin resistance, oxidative stress and even ovulatory dysfunction. Moreover, in this small sample clinical study, we also found that exenatide improved insulin sensitivity, reduced body weight and improved glycolipid metabolism in PCOS.NTGC-MS-based  pathway analysis revealed that exenatide has a beneficial effect on overweight/obese PCOS patients by regulating  disorders, especially amino acid disorders.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29675131>Glycine Increases Insulin Sensitivity and Glutathione Biosynthesis and Protects against Oxidative Stress in a Model of Sucrose-Induced Insulin Resistance.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress and redox status play a central role in the link between insulin resistance (IR) and lipotoxicity in . This mechanistic link may involve alterations in the glutathione redox state. We examined the effect of glycine supplementation to diet on glutathione biosynthesis, oxidative stress, IR, and insulin cell signaling in liver from sucrose-fed (SF) rats characterized by IR and oxidative stress. Our hypothesis is that the correction of glutathione levels by glycine treatment leads to reduced oxidative stress, a mechanism associated with improved insulin signaling and IR. Glycine treatment decreases the levels of oxidative stress markers in liver from SF rats and increases the concentrations of glutathione (GSH) and -glutamylcysteine and the amount of -glutamylcysteine synthetase (-GCS), a key enzyme of GSH biosynthesis in liver from SF rats. In liver from SF rats, glycine also decreases the insulin-induced phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (ISR-1) in serine residue and increases the phosphorylation of insulin receptor -subunit (IR-) in  residue. Thus, supplementing diets with glycine to correct GSH deficiency and to reduce oxidative stress provides significant  benefits to SF rats by improving insulin sensitivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27308087>A Case Report of a Very Rare Association of Tyrosinemia type I and Pancreatitis Mimicking Neurologic Crisis of Tyrosinemia Type I.</a></h2><p>Tyrosinemia type I is an autosomal recessively inherited  disease of  metabolism due to the deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase.

Model systems and human genetics support a role for IDOL in regulating circulating LDL levels. Whether IDOL plays a broader  role and affects development of -associated comorbidities is unknown. Approach and Results- We studied WT (wild type) and Idol (Idol-KO) mice in 2 models: physiological aging and diet-induced obesity. In both models, deletion of Idol protected mice from  dysfunction. On a Western-type diet, Idol loss resulted in decreased circulating levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and insulin. This was accompanied by protection from weight gain in short- and long-term dietary challenges, which could be attributed to reduced hepatosteatosis and fat mass in Idol-KO mice. Although feeding and intestinal fat uptake were unchanged in Idol-KO mice, their brown adipose tissue was protected from lipid accumulation and had elevated expression of UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1) and TH ( hydroxylase). Indirect calorimetry indicated a marked increase in locomotion and suggested a trend toward increased cumulative energy expenditure and fat oxidation. An increase in in vivo clearance of reconstituted lipoprotein particles in Idol-KO mice may sustain this energetic demand. In the BXD mouse genetic reference population, hepatic Idol expression correlates with multiple  parameters, thus providing support for findings in the Idol-KO mice. Conclusions- Our study uncovers an unrecognized role for Idol in regulation of whole body metabolism in physiological aging and on a Western-type diet. These findings support Idol inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to target multiple -associated comorbidities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27631195>Deciphering Brain Insulin Receptor and Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 Receptor Signalling.</a></h2><p>Insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) are highly conserved receptor  kinases that share signalling proteins and are ubiquitously expressed in the brain. Central application of insulin or IGF1 exerts several similar physiological outcomes, varying in strength, whereas disruption of the corresponding receptors in the brain leads to remarkably different effects on brain size and physiology, thus highlighting the unique effects of the corresponding hormone receptors. Central insulin/IGF1 resistance impacts upon various levels of the IR/IGF1R signalling pathways and is a feature of the  and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. The intricacy of brain insulin and IGF1 signalling represents a challenge for the identification of specific IR and IGF1R signalling differences in pathophysiological conditions.

This study aims to investigate the possible relation between the serum fetuin-A levels and the stages of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in patients with T2DM.This prospective study included 82 patients with T2DM and 19 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) (group 1). Diabetic patients were subclassified into three groups according to ocular findings: without DR (group 2; n = 26); non-proliferative DR (group 3; n = 29), and proliferative DR (group 4; n = 27). Serum fetuin-A levels were determined by a spectrophotometric technique using an immulite chemiluminescent immunometric assay. The data were analyzed using a Mann-Whitney U test, and the results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation.Mean fetuin-A values were 256.4 ± 21.3 μg/ml in group 1, 263.5 ± 24.2 μg/ml in group 2, 282.2 ± 31.1 μg/ml in group 3, and 296.3 ± 26.2 μg/ml in group 4. Group 2 had higher mean fetuin-A level compared with group 1, but the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Serum fetuin-A levels were significantly higher in groups 3 and 4 compared with HCs (both p < 0.05). Compared with group 2, both DR groups had higher fetuin-A levels with a significant difference (both p < 0.05); and patients with proliferative DR had significantly higher serum fetuin-A levels compared with non-proliferative DR (p < 0.05). The mean serum fetuin-A levels increased with the stage of DR, and the highest levels were found in patients with proliferative DR.Our findings suggest an association between fetuin-A levels and DR stage. In diabetic patients, the risk of retinopathy development increases with higher fetuin-A values.

Germline or somatic mutations of numerous genes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PPGLs, including the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene and alpha thalassemia/mental retardation  X-linked (ATRX) gene. Although concurrent IDH1 and ATRX mutations are frequently seen in gliomas, they have never been reported together in PPGLs. The aim of this study was to characterize one paraganglioma with concurrent IDH1 and ATRX mutations identified by whole exome sequencing.Leukocyte and tumor DNA were used for whole exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing. 2-hydroxyglurarate level and the global DNA methylation status in the tumor were measured. ATRX's cDNA transcripts were analyzed.  hydroxylase (TH), HIF1α and ATRX staining, as well as telomere-specific FISH was also performed.The presence of a somatic IDH1 (c.394C>T, p.R132C) mutation and a concurrent somatic ATRX splicing mutation (c.4318-2A>G) in the current case was confirmed. Dramatic accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate was detected in the paraganglioma without the global DNA hypermethylation, and pseudohypoxia was also activated. Importantly, immunohistochemistry revealed negative TH staining in the tumor and the first exon region of TH gene was hypermethylated resulting in normal plasma metanephrines. The splicing ATRX mutation resulted in two transcripts, causing frameshifts. Immunohistochemistry revealed scarce ATRX staining in the tumor. Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) was detected by FISH.This case represents the first concurrence of IDH1 and ATRX mutations in PPGLs. Although relatively rare, a somatic R132C mutation of IDH1 might play a role in a small subset of sporadic PPGLs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26962957>Adult-onset phenylketonuria with rapidly progressive dementia and parkinsonism.</a></h2><p>Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive  disorder due to mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, which converts phenylalanine (PHE) to .

In this review, we discuss the potential mechanisms of the brain-gut axis in relation to the pathophysiology of .A selective literature review was conducted to evaluate GI and brain interactions.Evidence suggests reduced microbial diversity in obesity and  dysregulation. However, findings of microbiota composition in obese individuals are inconsistent, and the investigation of causality between gut microbiota and energy homeostasis is complex because multiple variables contribute to the gut microbiota composition. The microbial metabolites short chain fatty acids are found to exert numerous physiologic effects, including energy homeostasis through the regulation of GI hormones such as cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide 1, peptide -, and leptin. Preclinical studies show that modifying rodents' microbiota through fecal transplantation results in alterations of these GI hormones and subsequently an altered metabolism and behavior. However, whether and to what extent preclinical findings translate to human metabolism is unclear.One of the major limitations and challenges in this field of research is interindividual variability of the microbiome. Future research needs to combine recent insights gained into tracking the dynamics of the microbiome as well as the  responses. Furthermore, advanced mapping of the human microbiome is required to investigate the  implications of the gut-brain axis to develop targeted interventions for obesity and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30897341>Low-intensity exercise in the prevention of cardiac insulin resistance-related inflammation and disturbances in NOS and MMP-9 regulation in fructose-fed ovariectomized rats.</a></h2><p>Exercise is important nonpharmacological treatment for improvement of insulin sensitivity in menopause. However, its effect on menopausal cardiac insulin resistance is needing further research. We investigated protective effects of low-intensity exercise on cardiac insulin signaling, inflammation, regulation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in ovariectomized (OVX) Wistar rats, submitted to 10% fructose solution for 9 weeks. OVX rats were divided into control, sedentary fructose, and exercise fructose groups. Measurements of physical and biochemical characteristics were carried out to evaluate  development. Messenger RNA and protein levels and phosphorylation of cardiac insulin signaling molecules, endothelial and inducible NOS (eNOS and iNOS), p65 subunit of nuclear factor κB (NFκB), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), and MMP-9 were analyzed. Fructose increased insulin level, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index, and visceral adipose tissue weight, while low-intensity exercise prevented insulin level and HOMA index increase. Fructose also decreased cardiac pAkt (Ser473), peNOS (Ser1177) and increased insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) phosphorylation at Ser307, pNFκB (Ser276) and NFκB and MMP-9 content, without any effect on iNOS, protein- phosphatase 1B, TNF-α, and SOCS3. Exercise prevented changes in pIRS1 (Ser307), pAkt (Ser473), peNOS (Ser1177), pNFκB (Ser276), and NFκB expression. In addition, exercise increased pIRS1 (Tyr632), pAkt (Thr308), and eNOS expression. Low-intensity exercise prevented cardiac insulin signaling disarrangement in fructose-fed OVX rats and therefore eNOS dysfunction, as well as pro-inflammatory signaling activation, without effect on tissue remodeling, suggesting physical training as a way to reduce cardiovascular risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30885989>Nine Amino Acids Are Associated With Decreased Insulin Secretion and Elevated Glucose Levels in a 7.4-Year Follow-up Study of 5,181 Finnish Men.</a></h2><p>Several amino acids (AAs) have been shown to be associated with insulin resistance and increased risk of type 2 diabetes, but no previous studies have investigated the association of AAs with insulin secretion in a longitudinal setting.

Nine AAs (phenylalanine, tryptophan, , alanine, isoleucine, leucine, valine, aspartate, and glutamate) were significantly ( < 5.8 × 10) associated with decreases in insulin secretion (disposition index) and the elevation of fasting or 2-h glucose levels. Five of these AAs (, alanine, isoleucine, aspartate, and glutamate) were also found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of incident type 2 diabetes after adjustment for confounding factors.

We hypothesized that SF-induced increases in protein  phosphatase-1B (PTP-1B) expression and activity underlie increased food intake, inflammation, and leptin and insulin resistance.Wild-type (WT) and ObR-PTP-1b-/- mice (Tg) were exposed to SF and control sleep (SC), and food intake was monitored. WT mice received a PTP-1B inhibitor (RO-7d; Tx) or vehicle (Veh). Upon completion of exposures, systemic insulin and leptin sensitivity tests were performed as well as assessment of visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT) insulin receptor sensitivity and macrophages (ATM) polarity.SF increased food intake in either untreated or Veh-treated WT mice. Leptin-induced hypothalamic STAT3 phosphorylation was decreased, PTP-1B activity was increased, and reduced insulin sensitivity emerged both systemic and in vWAT, with the latter displaying proinflammatory ATM polarity changes. All of the SF-induced effects were abrogated following PTP-1B inhibitor treatment and in Tg mice.SF induces increased food intake, reduced leptin signaling in hypothalamus, systemic insulin resistance, and reduced vWAT insulin sensitivity and inflammation that are mediated by increased PTP-1B activity. Thus, PTP-1B may represent a viable therapeutic target in the context of SF-induced weight gain and  dysfunction.© Sleep Research Society 2017.

A considerable number of factors affects the course of pregnancy and its outcome, their effect is realized at the level of the central nervous system through numerical  interactions, where monoaminergic systems play an important role. Objective - to study the features of the sympathoadrenal system state by determining the excretion level of DOPHA, dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine in women's daily urine with different periods of abortion. 227 pregnant women who were admitted to the Kharkiv perinatal center have been examined, 190 of them had clinical signs of premature delivery in the gestation period of 23-36 weeks. Formation of clinical groups was carried out depending on the pregnancy term in the form of premature and timely delivery. Diagnosis of preterm labor was carried out in the presence of abdominal pain  and structural changes in the cervix. Consequently, pregnancy compensatory and adaptive mechanisms are complex of neurohumoral process, which are realized through monoaminergic systems and a significant factor in its interruption is their destabilization. Reducing of sympathoadrenal system activity and reserve capacity in pregnant women may be a pathogenetic factor in the development of preterm labor.

Renal catecholamine and  hydroxylase levels were significantly reduced after RDN, suggesting effective renal denervation. Progression of renal dysfunction as characterized by increased urinary albumin/creatinine ratio and reduced glomerular filtration rate were attenuated by RDN. In SHRs-ob, renal perfusion was significantly reduced and normalized by RDN. Cardiac fibrosis and cardiac diastolic dysfunction measured by MRI and invasive pressure measurements were significantly attenuated by RDN.In SHRs-ob, progressive increase in blood pressure and progression of renal injury and cardiac remodelling are mediated by renal sympathetic activation as they were attenuated by RDN.© American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2014.

The impaired fat oxidation in obesity condition leads to increased hepatic fat accumulation and increased  risk. On the other hand, physical exercise has been demonstrated as a potent strategy in the prevention of NAFLD. Also, these beneficial effects of exercise occur through different mechanisms. Recently, the Cdc2-like kinase (CLK2) protein was associated with the suppression of fatty acid oxidation and hepatic ketogenesis. Thus, obese animals demonstrated elevated levels of hepatic CLK2 and decreased fat acid oxidation. Here, we explored the effects of chronic physical exercise in the hepatic metabolism of obese mice. Swiss mice were distributed in Lean, Obese (fed with high-fat diet during 16 weeks) and Trained Obese group (fed with high-fat diet during 16 weeks and exercised (at 60% exhaustion velocity during 1 h/5 days/week) during 8 weeks. In our results, the obese animals showed insulin resistance, increased hepatic CLK2 content and increased hepatic fat accumulation compared to the Lean group. Otherwise, the chronic physical exercise improved insulin resistance state, prevented the increased CLK2 in the liver and attenuated hepatic fat accumulation. In summary, these data reveal a new protein involved in the prevention of hepatic fat accumulation after chronic physical exercise. More studies can evidence the negative role of CLK2 in the control of liver metabolism, contributing to the improvement of insulin resistance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29559272>Amino acid levels in nascent : A contributor to the pro-inflammatory burden.</a></h2><p> (MetS) is a cluster of cardio- risk factors characterized by low-grade inflammation which confers an increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Due to the paucity of data in MetS, the aim of this study was to investigate the status of amino acids as early biomarkers of nascent MetS patients without T2DM and CVD or smoking.Healthy controls (n = 20) and MetS (n = 29) patients were recruited for the study. MetS was defined by criteria of National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III of having at least 3 risk factors. Urinary amino acids were quantified by gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry at the Western NIH Metabolomics Center as expressed to urinary creatinine. and Isoleucine levels were significantly elevated in MetS patients. Isoleucine positively correlated with salient cardio- features and inflammatory biomarkers. Lysine and Methionine levels were decreased in MetS patients. Lysine correlated negatively with cardio- features and inflammatory bimarkers. Methionine also correlated negatively with blood pressure and certain inflammatory biomarkers.Our novel results suggest that with regards to the cardio- risk factors and pro-inflammatory features of MetS, isoleucine (BCAA) demonstrated a positive correlation while lysine demonstrated a negative correlation. Thus, increased levels of isoleucine and decreased levels of lysine could be potential early biomarkers of MetS.Copyright © 2018.

In vitro studies have demonstrated that BVR-A is a substrate of the insulin receptor and regulates IRS1 by avoiding its aberrant activation, and in animal model of obesity the loss of hepatic BVR-A has been associated with glucose/insulin alterations and fatty liver disease. However, no studies exist in humans. Here, we evaluated BVR-A expression levels and activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from obese subjects and matched lean controls and we investigated the related molecular alterations of the insulin along with clinical correlates. We showed that BVR-A levels are significantly reduced in obese subjects and associated with a hyper-activation of the IR/IRS1/Akt/GSK-3β/AS160/GLUT4 pathway. Low BVR-A levels also associate with the presence of obesity, , NASH and visceral adipose tissue inflammation. These data suggest that the reduction of BVR-A may be responsible for early alterations of the insulin signaling pathway in obesity and in this context may represent a novel molecular target to be investigated for the comprehension of the process of insulin resistance development in obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It also causes activation of the renal renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that high-fat diet enhances the expression of RAS components. Three-month-old wild-type (Cc1(+/+)) and Cc1(-/-) mice were fed either a regular or a high-fat diet for 8 wk. At baseline under regular feeding conditions, Cc1(-/-) mice exhibited higher blood pressure, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), and renal expression of angiotensinogen, renin/prorenin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, (pro)renin receptor, angiotensin subtype AT1 receptor, angiotensin II, and elevated PI3K phosphorylation, as detected by p85α (Tyr(508)) immunostaining, inflammatory response, and the expression of collagen I and collagen III. In Cc1(+/+) mice, high-fat diet increased blood pressure, UACR, the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II, PI3K phosphorylation, inflammatory response, and the expression of collagen I and collagen III. In Cc1(-/-) mice, high-fat intake further amplified these parameters. Immunohistochemical staining showed increased p-PI3K p85α (Tyr(508)) expression in renal glomeruli, proximal, distal, and collecting tubules of Cc1(-/-) mice fed a high-fat diet. Together, this demonstrates that high-fat diet amplifies the permissive effect of Ceacam1 deletion on renal expression of all RAS components, PI3K phosphorylation, inflammation, and fibrosis.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28291245> kinase inhibitor BIBF1120 ameliorates inflammation, angiogenesis and fibrosis in CCl-induced liver fibrogenesis mouse model.</a></h2><p>Hepatic fibrosis, a progressive chronic disease mainly caused by hepatitis viral infections, alcohol abuse or  leading to liver dysfunction and is the growing cause of mortality worldwide.  kinase inhibitor BIBF1120 (Nintedanib) has been evaluated in clinical trials for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and advanced Hepatocellular carcinoma, but has not been explored for liver fibrosis yet. In this study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanism of BIBF1120 in liver fibrogenesis. The effects of BIBF1120 were evaluated in TGFβ-activated mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, LX2 cells, primary human hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and CCl-induced liver fibrogenesis mouse model. Fibroblasts-conditioned medium studies were performed to assess the paracrine effects on macrophages and endothelial cells. In-vitro in TGFβ-activated fibroblasts, BIBF1120 significantly inhibited expression of major fibrotic parameters, wound-healing and contractility. In vivo in CCl-induced acute liver injury model, post-disease BIBF1120 administration significantly attenuated collagen accumulation and HSC activation.

Dietary treatment, initiated soon after birth, prevents most brain-related complications. A leading hypothesis postulates that a shortage of brain monoamines may be associated with neurocognitive deficits that are observable even in early-treated PKU. However, there is a paucity of evidence as yet for this hypothesis.We therefore assessed in vivo striatal dopamine D2/3 receptor (D2/3R) availability and plasma monoamine metabolite levels together with measures of impulsivity and executive functioning in 18 adults with PKU and average intellect (31.2 ± 7.4 years, nine females), most of whom were early and continuously treated. Comparison data from 12 healthy controls that did not differ in gender and age were available.Mean D2/3R availability was significantly higher (13%; p = 0.032) in the PKU group (n = 15) than in the controls, which may reflect reduced synaptic brain dopamine levels in PKU. The PKU group had lower plasma levels of homovanillic acid (p < 0.001) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylglycol (p < 0.0001), the predominant metabolites of dopamine and norepinephrine, respectively.

However, the mechanism that mediates SRC-dependent JNK activation is unclear. Here, we identify a role for the scaffold protein JIP1 in SRC-dependent JNK activation.

These interactions are required for SRC-induced activation of VAV and the subsequent engagement of a JIP1-tethered JNK signaling module. The JIP1 scaffold protein, therefore, plays a dual role in FFA signaling by coordinating upstream SRC functions together with downstream effector signaling by the JNK pathway.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

Increasing sleep duration may be an appropriate strategy to reduce cardiometabolic risk in short-sleeping individuals. The aim is to review the effects of sleep extension interventions on cardiometabolic risk in adults. The PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for relevant, English, peer-reviewed scientific publications (until August 2018). Seven studies that aimed to increase sleep duration in adults by any sleep extension intervention and described at least one cardiometabolic risk factor were included. These studies had a combined sample size of 138 participants who were either healthy (n = 14), healthy short-sleeping (n = 92), overweight short-sleeping (n = 10), or pre- or hypertensive short-sleeping (n = 22) individuals. The durations of the sleep extension interventions ranged from 3 days to 6 weeks, and all successfully increased total sleep time by between 21 and 177 min. Sleep extension was associated with improved direct and indirect measures of insulin sensitivity, decreased leptin and peptide -, and reductions in overall appetite, desire for sweet and salty foods, intake of daily free sugar, and percentage of daily caloric intake from protein.

NADPH oxidase-mediated formation of superoxide entails transfer of two electrons (provided by NADPH) from the cytosol to the endosomal lumen, where two molecules of superoxide are generated. This charge transfer must be balanced if NADPH oxidase activity is to be sustained. In many cells, this balance is achieved by ClC-3, a chloride-proton antiporter which can extrude two chlorides from the endosome to balance the importation of two electrons. The efficiency of this chloride extrusion will evidently be contingent on the cytosolic chloride level. Pro-inflammatory hormones which stimulate NADPH oxidase activity in endosomes have been shown to promote chloride extrusion from the cell, thereby expediting endosomal chloride export. Conversely, high cytosolic chloride could potentially slow endosomal NADPH oxidase activity by impeding ClC-3-mediated chloride export. Glycine-activated, strychnine-inhibitable chloride channels, which boost intracellular chloride in cells which maintain intracellular chloride levels lower than that of plasma, have shown anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic activity in cell culture and rodent studies. It is proposed that many of these effects may be attributable to glycine-mediated suppression of endosomal NADPH oxidase activity. This model suggests that supplemental glycine may have utility for prevention and control of atherosclerosis, heart failure, angiogenesis associated with cancer or retinal disorders, and a range of inflammation-driven syndromes - including ; and it might complement the suppression of NADPH oxidase activity achievable with phycocyanobilin-enriched spirulina extracts.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The Src homology-2 domain containing phosphatase SHP2 (encoded by PTPN11) is an important phosphatase, which was found to be implicated in the regulation of genetic disease, development, , neurological, muscle, skeletal disease and cancer. Germline mutations in PTPN11 cause the Noonan , LEOPARD  and metachondromatosis. Somatic PTPN11 mutations occur in hematologic malignancies and in solid tumors. SHP2 is also an important component in oncogenic signaling pathways. It may play different roles in different stages and positions of human cancers. Whether SHP2 is an oncogene or cancer suppressor gene remains to be elucidated. Elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms of SHP2 in human disease will provide new insights into disease and new targets for therapy. Here, we summarized the structural basis and recent research progression on SHP2 in various human disease, including genetic and cancer diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27129733>Role and mechanisms of regulation of the basolateral K 4.1/K 5.1K channels in the distal tubules.</a></h2><p>Epithelial K channels are essential for maintaining electrolyte and fluid homeostasis in the kidney. It is recognized that basolateral inward-rectifying K (K ) channels play an important role in the control of resting membrane potential and transepithelial voltage, thereby modulating water and electrolyte transport in the distal part of nephron and collecting duct. Monomeric K 4.1 (encoded by Kcnj10 gene) and heteromeric K 4.1/K 5.1 (K 4.1 together with K 5.1 (Kcnj16)) channels are abundantly expressed at the basolateral membranes of the distal convoluted tubule and the cortical collecting duct cells. Loss-of-function mutations in KCNJ10 cause EAST/SeSAME tubulopathy in humans associated with salt wasting, hypomagnesaemia,  alkalosis and hypokalaemia. In contrast, mice lacking K 5.1 have severe renal phenotype that, apart from hypokalaemia, is the opposite of the phenotype seen in EAST/SeSAME . Experimental advances using genetic animal models provided critical insights into the physiological role of these channels in electrolyte homeostasis and the control of kidney function. Here, we discuss current knowledge about K channels at the basolateral membrane of the distal tubules with specific focus on the homomeric K 4.1 and heteromeric K 4.1/K 5.1 channels. Recently identified molecular mechanisms regulating expression and activity of these channels, such as cell acidification, dopamine, insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1, Src family protein  kinases, as well as the role of these channels in NCC-mediated transport in the distal convoluted tubules, are also described.© 2016 Scandinavian Physiological Society.

It has been demonstrated that dyslipidemia can alter the reproductive function. Animal models have recently been used to show that the offspring of dyslipidemic males could also develop such pathologies and that the transgenerational transmission involved post-testicular sperm maturation. These data targeted the essential role of male gamete epididymal maturation and its importance for the health of the offspring.This publication summarizes in the first place experimental data obtained using a mouse model of dyslipidemia-induced post-testicular infertility, knockout mice for the two isoforms of the 'Liver X Receptors' (Lxrα;β ), the major regulators of cholesterol homeostasis. The impact of a high cholesterol diet (HCD) on the protein YWHAZ (14-3-3 ζ or  3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein Zeta) was also investigated in our model.In our mouse model, when young fertile Lxrα;β males aged three months were fed four weeks with a HCD, they developed an epididymal phenotype leading to infertility. The level of sperm YWHAZ was evaluated by Western blot and its  phosphorylation state by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot.Our data revealed that sperm lipid composition and structure were altered, leading to defects of the capacitation-associated signaling pathway. They also showed that both the level and the  phosphorylation state of YWHAZ were affected by the HCD in sperm cells from Lxrα;β males.YWHAZ could be a new important regulator of capacitation-associated  phosphorylation and a marker of dyslipidemia-induced infertility.© 2019 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of Andrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28778954>β-Klotho sustains postnatal GnRH biology and spins the thread of puberty.</a></h2><p>Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a  found to be isolated (IHH) or associated with anosmia, corresponding to the Kallmann  (KS).

Here we have assessed the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of BIO 300 in the nonhuman primate (NHP). In addition, we analyzed serum samples from animals receiving a single dose of BIO 300 for global metabolomic changes using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF-MS). We present a comparison of how either intramuscularly () or orally () administered BIO 300 changed the metabolomic profile. We observed transient alterations in phenylalanine, , glycerophosphocholine, and glycerophosphoserine which reverted back to near-normal levels 7 days after drug administration. We found a significant overlap in the metabolite profile changes induced by each route of administration; with the  route showing fewer  alterations. Taken together, our results suggest that the administration of BIO 300 results in  shifts that could provide an overall advantage to combat radiation injury. This initial assessment also highlights the utility of metabolomics and lipidomics to determine the underlying physiological mechanisms involved in the radioprotective efficacy of BIO 300.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25905195>Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Tumor (VIPoma).</a></h2><p>The VIPoma  termed pancreatic cholera because the observed severe diarrhea resembled  disease. The acronym WDHHA (watery diarrhea [100%], hypokalemia [100%], achlorhydria) and acidosis from bicarbonate wasting is often present for 3 or 4 years before diagnosis, with volumes usually exceeding 6 to 8 L of stool every 24 hours. Flushing and hypercalcemia are frequent but tetany can occur which may be due to hypomagnesemia. Other features include abnormal glucose tolerance, and dilation of the gallbladder. Tumors secreting VIP usually originate in the pancreas or along the sympathetic chain as ganglioneuroblastomas, neurofibromas, and pheochromocytomas as well as throughout the gut, skin and bone marrow. VIP is not the only agent implicated in the diarrhea . Gastrin, secretin, glucagon, enteroglucagon, GIP, PP, VIP, thyrocalcitonin (TCT), prostaglandins, and peptide fragments of pre-pro VIP or any one of a number of combinations have been implicated as possible etiologic agents of the diarrhea . Clinically the secretory nature of this  is exemplified by diarrhea that persists with fasting! Tumors can be localized by ultrasound if large, CT, celiac, superior mesenteric angiography and renal angiograpy and if negative transhepatic portal venous sampling. Initial treatment should be correction of fluid and electrolyte loss. Primary treatment should be surgical excision or debulking followed by somatostatin analog therapy which may control the secretions as well as the tumor growth. There appears to be little difference in the tumor response to lanreotide, interferon or both and PRRT which has been shown to improve quality of life.

The interaction of DNA damage and inflammation is affected by the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) signaling pathway. The IGF1R pathway has been reported to regulate autophagy, as well, but sometimes through a bidirectional context. Targeting the IGF1R-autophagy crosstalk could represent a promising strategy for the development of new antiinflammatory and anticancer therapies, and may help for subjects suffering from MetS who are at increased risk of colorectal cancer. However, therapeutic responses to targeted therapies are often shortlived, since a signaling crosstalk of IGF1R with other receptor  kinases or autophagy exists, leading to acquired cellular resistance to therapy. From a pharmacological point of view, it is attractive to speculate that synergistic beneﬁts could be achieved by inhibition of one of the key effectors of the IGF1R pathway, in parallel with the pharmacological stimulation of the autophagy machinery, but cautiousness is also required, because pharmacologic IGF1R modulation can initiate additional, sometimes unfavorable biologic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25438716>Features of endothelial dysfunction in umbilical cord vessels of  women with gestational diabetes.</a></h2><p>Gestational diabetes (GDM) is associated with increased oxidative stress and overexpression of inflammatory cytokines, both of which might lead to endothelial dysfunction and vascular disease. As such, GDM could be viewed as a sort of ‘short lived’ . As umbilical cord vessels represent a suitable model for the study of vascular alterations brought about by GDM, the aim of the present work was to characterize the phenotype of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) chronically exposed to hyperglycaemia and to a pro-inflammatory environment during pregnancy so as to identify molecular modifications of cellular homoeostasis eventually impacting on endothelial dysfunction.Tissue specimens and HUVECs were obtained from umbilical cords of GDMand control women. As compared to controls, GD-HUVEC exhibited enhanced monocyte adhesion and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1(ICAM-1) expression and exposure on plasma membrane after tumour necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-α) stimulation (Western blot, flow cytometer). As compared to control cells, GD-HUVEC in basal conditions exhibited enhanced monocyte adhesion, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression and activity (eNOS Real-Time polymerase chain reaction, Western Blot for eNOS total protein and monomers/dimers ratio, conversion of [3H]-L-arginine in [3H]-L-citrulline), increased O(-)(2)egeneration together with increased NT levels (immunofluorescence) and reduced NO bioavailability(guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) production, EIA).

Although often expressed as an increase in insulin concentration, the disease is characterized by a decrease in insulin action. This increased workload of the pancreas and the consequent decompensation are not only the main mechanisms for the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but also exacerbate the damage of  diseases, including obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, polycystic ovary , , and others. Many clinical trials have suggested the potential role of herbs in the treatment of insulin resistance, although most of the clinical trials included in this review have certain flaws and bias risks in their methodological design, including the generation of randomization, the concealment of allocation, blinding, and inadequate reporting of sample size estimates. These studies involve not only the single-flavored herbs, but also herbal formulas, extracts, and active ingredients. Numerous of  and  studies have pointed out that the role of herbal medicine in improving insulin resistance is related to interventions in various aspects of the insulin signaling pathway. The targets involved in these studies include insulin receptor substrate, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, glucose transporter, AMP-activated protein kinase, glycogen synthase kinase 3, mitogen-activated protein kinases, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase, nuclear factor-kappaB, protein  phosphatase 1B, nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Improved insulin sensitivity upon treatment with herbal medicine provides considerable prospects for treating insulin resistance.

Kir4.1 and Kir4.1/Kir5.1 heterotetramer are abundantly expressed in the basolateral membrane of late thick ascending limb (TAL), distal convoluted tubule (DCT), connecting tubule (CNT) and cortical collecting duct (CCD). Loss-of-function mutations in KCNJ10 cause EAST/SeSAME  in humans associated with epilepsy, ataxia, sensorineural deafness and water-electrolyte metabolism imbalance, which is characterized by salt wasting, hypomagnesaemia, hypokalaemia and  alkalosis. In contrast, mice lacking Kir5.1 have severe renal phenotype apart from hypokalaemia such as high chlorine  acidosis and hypercalcinuria. The genetic knockout or functional inhibition of Kir4.1 suppresses Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC) expression and activity in the DCT. However, the downregulation of Kir4.1 increases epithelial Na channel (ENaC) expression in the collecting duct. Recently, factors regulating expression and activity of Kir4.1 and Kir4.1/Kir5.1 were identified, such as cell acidification, dopamine, insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1.

Adding fibers to mixed dishes is one way to increase fiber intake. However, adding fibers to foods versus including foods inherently containing fiber may reveal differing effects on satiety. The present study aimed to explore the satiety effects of adding fiber to a mixed meal versus using beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) as a source of intrinsic fiber in the meal. In this pilot study, 12 men and women with  were randomly assigned to eat three standard meals in a crossover design on three different occasions that contained either no added fiber (control (NF)), extrinsic or added fiber (AF), or whole black beans as the source of intrinsic fiber (BN). Meals were matched for energy and macronutrient composition. Five hour postprandial subjective satiety was measured along with blood glucose, insulin, and the GI hormones, cholecystokinin (CCK) and peptide   (PYY). All meals induced fullness to a similar degree; however, the AF meal suppressed prospective consumption (F = 9.05, P = 0.0002) compared to the BN or NF meals. The NF meal tended to result in more satisfaction than the BN meal (F = 5.91, P = 0.003). The BN meal produced significantly higher postprandial CCK concentrations compared to the AF (F = 6.82, P = 0.001) and NF meals (F = 6.82, P = 0.002). Similar findings were observed for PYY response for BN > AF meal (F = 9.11, P < 0.0001). Postprandial insulin was significantly reduced after the BN meal, compared to the NF (F = 22.36, P < 0.0001) meal.

However, the central mechanisms involved in this phenomenon are not known. Since neonatal handling has persistent effects on stress and anxiety responses, we hypothesized that its involvement in the aforementioned association may be associated with differential neuroadaptations in the amygdala during withdrawal periods.Litters were randomized into two groups: handled (H, removed from their dam for 10min per day from the first to the tenth postnatal day and placed in an incubator at 32°C) and non-handled (NH). Experiment 1: on PNDs 80-100, females were assigned to receive palatable food+rat chow for 15 or 30 days, and these two groups were compared in terms of palatable food preference, body weight and abdominal fat deposition. In Experiment 2, H and NH rats were exposed to a chronic diet of palatable food+rat chow for 15 days, followed by (a) no withdrawal, (b) 24h withdrawal from palatable food (receiving only rat chow) or (c) 7-day withdrawal from palatable food (receiving only rat chow). Body weight, 10-min rebound palatable food intake, abdominal fat deposition, serum corticosterone as well as TH and pCREB levels in the amygdala were then compared between groups.Experiment 1-chronic exposure to palatable food induces comparable  effects after 15 and 30 days. Experiment 2-neonatal handling is associated with a peculiar response to palatable food withdrawal following chronic exposure for 15 days. Rats exposed to early handling ingested less of this food after a 24h withdrawal period, and displayed increased amygdala TH and pCREB levels.Variations in the neonatal environment affect both behavioral responses and amygdala neuroadaptation to acute withdrawal from a palatable diet.

Insulin effects in target cells are mediated by the insulin receptor (IR), a transmembrane protein with enzymatic ( kinase) activity. The insulin receptor, however, is represented by a heterogeneous family of proteins, including two different IR isoforms and also hybrid receptors resulting from the IR hemireceptor combination with a hemireceptor of the cognate IGF-1 receptor. These different receptors may bind insulin and its analogs with different affinity and produce different biologic effects. Since many years, it is known that many cancer cells require insulin for optimal in vitro growth. Recent data indicate that: (1) insulin stimulates growth mainly via its own receptor and not the IGF-1 receptor; (2) in many cancer cells, the IR is overexpressed and the A isoform, which has a predominant mitogenic effect, is more represented than the B isoform. These characteristics provide a selective growth advantage to malignant cells when exposed to insulin. For this reason, all conditions of hyperinsulinemia, both endogenous (prediabetes, , obesity, type 2 diabetes before pancreas exhaustion and polycystic ovary ) and exogenous (type 1 diabetes) will increase the risk of cancer. Cancer-related mortality is also increased in patients exposed to hyperinsulinemia but other factors, related to the different diseases, may also contribute. The complexity of the diseases associated with hyperinsulinemia and their therapies does not allow a precise evaluation of the cancer-promoting effect of hyperinsulinemia, but its detrimental effect on cancer incidence and mortality is well documented.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29180021>Insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by TNF-α is improved by punicic acid through upregulation of insulin signalling pathway and endocrine function, and downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance (IR) has become a major threat to public health due to its role in . Inflammation associated with IR is an interesting area of biomedical research in recent years and is expected to affect insulin signalling pathway via downregulating glucose transporters. In the present study, we evaluate the potential of punicic acid (PA), a nutraceutical found in pomegranate seed oil, against TNF-α induced alteration in 3T3-L1 adipocytes on glucose metabolism, endocrine function and inflammation. IR was induced in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by treating with TNF-α (10 ng/mL) and various concentrations of PA (5, 10, 30 μM) were incubated simultaneously. After 24 h, we found that TNF-α treatment increased mRNA expression of SOCS3, PTP1B and a decrease in IRS1 causing diminished glucose uptake. Further, it showed significantly increased transcriptional activity of NFκB and leptin secretion while PA maintained leptin levels normal. Additionally, PA prevented the over-expression of phosphorylated JNK in a dose dependent manner during IR. PA also ameliorated significantly the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. From the results, we conclude that PA is effective to ameliorate TNF-α induced IR and also we recommend the intake of PA for control and management of IR and its associated complications.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Direct platelet-bacterium interactions might contribute to some of these conditions; however, mechanisms of human platelet activation by E. coli leading to thrombus formation are poorly understood. While the IgG receptor FcγRIIA has a key role in platelet response to various Gram-positive species, its role in activation to Gram-negative bacteria is poorly defined. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of human platelet activation by E. coli, including the potential role of FcγRIIA. Using light-transmission aggregometry, measurements of ATP release and -phosphorylation, we investigated the ability of two E. coli clinical isolates to activate platelets in plasma, in the presence or absence of specific receptors and signaling inhibitors. Aggregation assays with washed platelets supplemented with IgGs were performed to evaluate the requirement of this plasma component in activation. We found a critical role for the immune receptor FcγRIIA, αIIbβ3, and Src and Syk  kinases in platelet activation in response to E. coli. IgG and αIIbβ3 engagement was required for FcγRIIA activation. Moreover, feedback mediators adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) and thromboxane A2 (TxA2) were essential for platelet aggregation. These findings suggest that human platelet responses to E. coli isolates are similar to those induced by Gram-positive organisms. Our observations support the existence of a central FcγRIIA-mediated pathway by which human platelets respond to both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28306672>Radiotherapy, chemotherapy and atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>This article reviews the effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in promoting the progression of atherosclerosis in patients with cancer.Radiotherapy is associated with an increase in the incidence of atherosclerosis with the effects being related to the site of irradiation and dose of radiotherapy. Cranial irradiation is associated with dyslipidaemia and the  secondary to effect on growth hormone secretion. Chemotherapeutic oncological therapies are associated with numerous cardiac diseases including valve disease, pericarditis and cardiomyopathy but can also promote atherosclerosis.

Antimetabolites such as 5-fluorouraciland capecitabine cause chest pain and increase CVD events. Anthracyclines cause heart failure and may increase CVD risk.There is increasing evidence that radiotherapy and some chemotherapeutic agents are associated with increased rates of CVD. Patients who have received treatment for cancer should be considered at higher risk of developing atherosclerosis and require increased monitoring, further investigation and earlier treatment than would be suggested by classical risk factor management strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27086263>Dopamine dysregulation  with psychosis in 24-hour intestinal levodopa infusion for Parkinson's disease.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30521183>Aggressive Pituitary Tumors and Pituitary Carcinomas.</a></h2><p>Aggressive pituitary tumors (APT) refer to pituitary adenomas exhibiting rapid growth, resistance to conventional treatments and/or early/multiple recurrences, with abandonment of the previous term ‘atypical pituitary adenoma’. Pituitary carcinomas (PC) are defined by non-contiguous craniospinal or distant metastasis. Whilst PC is exceedingly rare, comprising only 0.1-0.2% of all pituitary neoplasms, APT may account for up to 15% of all pituitary neoplasms, depending on the definition used. Typically evolving from known pituitary macroadenomas, APT/PC is most commonly diagnosed in the fifth decade of life with corticotroph and lactotroph neoplasms predominating. Diagnosis relies on MRI, hormonal studies and histological assessment including proliferative markers and immunohistochemistry for pituitary hormones and, most recently, transcription factors. Structural and molecular mechanisms have been proposed in the pathogenesis of APT/PC, although there appears to be no contribution from known familial pituitary tumor  genes such as . Treatment is multimodal, ideally delivered by an expert team with a high-volume caseload. Surgical resection may be performed with the aim of either gross total resection or tumor debulking. Radiotherapy may be administered either as fractionated external beam radiation or stereotactic radiosurgery. Standard pituitary medical therapies such as somatostatin analogues have limited efficacy in APT/PC, whereas temozolomide yields a clear survival benefit. Evidence is emerging for the use of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy,  kinase inhibitors, VEGF inhibitors, and immunotherapy. Avenues for further research in APT/PC include molecular biomarkers, nuclear imaging, establishment of an international register, and routine pituitary tumor biobanking.Copyright © 2000-2019, MDText.com, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28447460>Effects of Histidine Supplementation on Global Serum and Urine H NMR-based Metabolomics and Serum Amino Acid Profiles in Obese Women from a Randomized Controlled Study.</a></h2><p>The aim of current study was to investigate the  changes associated with histidine supplementation in serum and urine  signatures and serum amino acid (AA) profiles.

As full agonists of PPARγ, thiazolidinedione (TZD) drugs elicit antidiabetic effects by targeting PPARγ but is accompanied by weight gain, fluid retention and cardiovascular risk associated with their transcriptional agonism potency. We here identify a natural product chelerythrine as a unique selective PPAR modulator (SPPARM) with a potent PPARγ binding activity but much less classical receptor transcriptional agonism. Structural analysis reveals that chelerythrine exhibits unique binding in parallel with H3 of PPARγ. Unlike TZDs, chelerythrine destabilizes helix 12, especially residue  473, resulting in a loose configuration of AF-2 and a selective cofactor profile distinct from TZDs, leading to a differential target gene profile in adipogenesis in db/db diabetic mice. Moreover, chelerythrine improved insulin sensitivity by more potently blocking the phosphorylation of PPARγ by CDK5 compared to TZDs. These data fundamentally elucidate the mechanism by which chelerythrine retains the benefits of improving insulin sensitivity while reducing the adverse effects of TZDs, suggesting that the natural product chelerythrine is a very promising pharmacological agent by selectively targeting PPARγ for further development in the clinical treatment of insulin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29270816>Arctic berry extracts target the gut-liver axis to alleviate  endotoxaemia, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>There is growing evidence that fruit polyphenols exert beneficial effects on the , but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the present study, we aimed to analyse the effects of polyphenolic extracts from five types of Arctic berries in a model of diet-induced obesity.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed a high-fat/high-sucrose (HFHS) diet and orally treated with extracts of bog blueberry (BBE), cloudberry (CLE), crowberry (CRE), alpine bearberry (ABE), lingonberry (LGE) or vehicle (HFHS) for 8 weeks. An additional group of standard-chow-fed, vehicle-treated mice was included as a reference control for diet-induced obesity. OGTTs and insulin tolerance tests were conducted, and both plasma insulin and C-peptide were assessed throughout the OGTT. Quantitative PCR, western blot analysis and ELISAs were used to assess enterohepatic immunometabolic features. Faecal DNA was extracted and 16S rRNA gene-based analysis was used to profile the gut microbiota.Treatment with CLE, ABE and LGE, but not with BBE or CRE, prevented both fasting hyperinsulinaemia (mean ± SEM [pmol/l]: chow 67.2 ± 12.3, HFHS 153.9 ± 19.3, BBE 114.4 ± 14.3, CLE 82.5 ± 13.0, CRE 152.3 ± 24.4, ABE 90.6 ± 18.0, LGE 95.4 ± 10.5) and postprandial hyperinsulinaemia (mean ± SEM AUC [pmol/l × min]: chow 14.3 ± 1.4, HFHS 31.4 ± 3.1, BBE 27.2 ± 4.0, CLE 17.7 ± 2.2, CRE 32.6 ± 6.3, ABE 22.7 ± 18.0, LGE 23.9 ± 2.5). None of the berry extracts affected C-peptide levels or body weight gain. Levels of hepatic serine phosphorylated Akt were 1.6-, 1.5- and 1.2-fold higher with CLE, ABE and LGE treatment, respectively, and hepatic carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM)-1  phosphorylation was 0.6-, 0.7- and 0.9-fold increased in these mice vs vehicle-treated, HFHS-fed mice. These changes were associated with reduced liver triacylglycerol deposition, lower circulating endotoxins, alleviated hepatic and intestinal inflammation, and major gut microbial alterations (e.g. bloom of Akkermansia muciniphila, Turicibacter and Oscillibacter) in CLE-, ABE- and LGE-treated mice.Our findings reveal novel mechanisms by which polyphenolic extracts from ABE, LGE and especially CLE target the gut-liver axis to protect diet-induced obese mice against  endotoxaemia, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis, which importantly improves hepatic insulin clearance. These results support the potential benefits of these Arctic berries and their integration into health programmes to help attenuate obesity-related chronic inflammation and  disorders.All raw sequences have been deposited in the public European Nucleotide Archive server under accession number PRJEB19783 ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB19783 ).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28952199>Beetroot and Sodium Nitrate Ameliorate Cardiometabolic Changes in Diet-Induced Obese Hypertensive Rats.</a></h2><p>Dietary intake of beetroot by humans reduces blood pressure but whether this is caused by nitrate or betanin is not well-defined; neither are effects on other signs of .Rats fed a high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet (H) for 16 weeks developed abdominal obesity, hypertension, altered cardiovascular and liver structure and function, and impaired glucose tolerance compared to rats fed a corn starch diet (C).

Metabolome profiling in patients and animal models may identify affected  pathways and reveal new biomarkers of disease progression. Using liver metabolomics we have shown a starvation-like condition in a knock-in () mouse model of GRACILE , a neonatal lethal respiratory chain complex III dysfunction with hepatopathy. Here, we hypothesized that a high-carbohydrate diet (HCD, 60% dextrose) will alleviate the hypoglycemia and promote survival of the sick mice. However, when fed HCD the homozygotes had shorter survival (mean ± SD, 29 ± 2.5 days,  = 21) than those on standard diet (33 ± 3.8 days,  = 30), and no improvement in hypoglycemia or liver glycogen depletion. We investigated the plasma metabolome of the HCD- and control diet-fed mice and found that several amino acids and urea cycle intermediates were increased, and arginine, carnitines, succinate, and purine catabolites decreased in the homozygotes. Despite reduced survival the increase in aromatic amino acids, an indicator of liver mitochondrial dysfunction, was normalized on HCD. Quantitative enrichment analysis revealed that glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, phenylalanine and  metabolism, and urea cycle were also partly normalized on HCD. This dietary intervention revealed an unexpected adverse effect of high-glucose diet in complex III deficiency, and suggests that plasma metabolomics is a valuable tool in evaluation of therapies in mitochondrial disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25092113>DYRK1B variant linked to autosomal dominant .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29152592>Revisiting the IGF-1R as a breast cancer target.</a></h2><p>The type I insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor is a well-described target in breast cancer and multiple clinical trials examining insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor have been completed. Unfortunately, monoclonal antibodies and  kinase inhibitors targeting insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor failed in phase III breast clinical trials for several reasons. First, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor antibody therapy resulted in hyperglycemia and  most likely due to disruption of insulin-like growth factor-1 homeostasis and subsequent growth hormone elevation. Growth hormone elevation induces insulin resistance, hence a subsequent elevation of insulin and the potential for activation of insulin receptor. Second, the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and insulin receptor are highly homologous in amino acid sequence, structure, and function. These two receptors bind insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 and insulin-like growth factor-2, to regulate glucose uptake and other cellular functions. Hybrid receptors composed of one chain of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and insulin receptor also participate in signaling. Third, since all the monoclonal antibodies were specific for insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, any pathophysiologic role for insulin receptor was not inhibited. While the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor  kinase inhibitors effectively inhibited both insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and insulin receptor, these drugs are not being further developed likely due to their  toxicities. Insulin-like growth factor-1/2 neutralizing antibodies are still being studied in early phase clinical trials. Perhaps a more comprehensive strategy of targeting the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor network would be successful. For example, targeting receptor, ligand and downstream signaling molecules such as phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase or particularly the insulin receptor substrate adapter proteins might result in a complete blockade of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor/insulin receptor biological functions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29342922>Can EGCG Alleviate Symptoms of Down  by Altering Proteolytic Activity?</a></h2><p>Down  (DS), also known as "trisomy 21", is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21. Silencing these extra genes is beyond existing technology and seems to be impractical. A number of pharmacologic options have been proposed to change the quality of life and lifespan of individuals with DS. It was reported that treatment with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) improves cognitive performance in animal models and in humans, suggesting that EGCG may alleviate symptoms of DS. Traditionally, EGCG has been associated with the ability to reduce dual specificity  phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A activity, which is overexpressed in trisomy 21. Based on the data available in the literature, we propose an additional way in which EGCG might affect trisomy 21-namely by modifying the proteolytic activity of the enzymes involved. It is known that, in Down , the nerve growth factor (NGF)  pathway is altered: first by downregulating tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) that activates plasminogen to plasmin, an enzyme converting proNGF to mature NGF; secondly, overexpression of metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) further degrades NGF, lowering the amount of mature NGF. EGCG inhibits MMP-9, thus protecting NGF. Urokinase (uPA) and tPA are activators of plasminogen, and uPA is inhibited by EGCG, but regardless of their structural similarity tPA is not inhibited. In this review, we describe mechanisms of proteolytic enzymes (MMP-9 and plasminogen activation system), their role in Down , their inhibition by EGCG, possible degradation of this polyphenol and the ability of EGCG and its degradation products to cross the blood-brain barrier. We conclude that known data accumulated so far provide promising evidence of MMP-9 inhibition by EGCG in the brain, which could slow down the abnormal degradation of NGF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26248309>Diet-induced obesity and kidney disease - In search of a susceptible mouse model.</a></h2><p>Obesity and  are independent risk factors for chronic kidney disease, even without diabetes or hyperglycemia. Here, we compare two mouse models that are susceptible to diet-induced obesity: the relatively renal injury resistant C57BL/6J strain and the DBA2/J strain which is more sensitive to renal injury. Our studies focused on characterizing the effects of high fat diet feeding on renal oxidative stress, albuminuria, fibrosis and podocyte loss/insulin resistance. While the C57BL/6J strain does not develop significant pathological changes in the kidney, at least on lard based diets within the time frame investigated, it does show increased renal iNOS and nitrotyrosine levels and elevated mitochondrial respiration which may be indicative of mitochondrial lipid overfueling. Restricting the high fat diet to decrease adiposity decreased the levels of cellular oxidative stress markers, indicating that adiposity-related proinflammatory changes such as increased iNOS levels may trigger similar responses in the kidney. Mitochondrial respiration remained higher, suggesting that eating excess lipids, despite normal adiposity may still lead to renal mitochondrial overfueling. In comparison, DBA/2J mice developed albuminuria on similar diets, signs of fibrosis, oxidative stress, early signs of podocyte loss (evaluated by the markers podocin and WT-1) and podocyte insulin resistance (unable to phosphorylate their glomerular Akt when insulin was given). To summarize, while the C57BL/6J strain is not particularly susceptible to renal disease, changes in its mitochondrial lipid handling combined with the easy availability of transgenic technology may be an advantage to design new knockout models related to mitochondrial lipid metabolism. The DBA/2J model could serve as a basis for studying podocyte insulin resistance and identifying early renal markers in obesity before more severe kidney disease develops. Based on our observations, we encourage further critical evaluation of mouse models for obesity related chronic kidney disease.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

The aberrant activation of BDNF/TrkB pathways can modulate several signaling pathways, including Akt/PI3K, Jak/STAT, NF-kB, UPAR/UPA, Wnt/β-catenin, and VEGF pathways as well as the ER receptor. Several microRNAs have been identified that are involved in the modulation of BDNF/TrkB pathways. These include miR-206, miR-204, MiR-200a/c, MiR-210, MiR-134, and MiR-191; and these may be of value as prognostic and predictive biomarkers for detecting patients at high risk of developing breast cancer. It has been also been demonstrated that a high expression of genes involved in the BDNF pathway in breast cancer is associated with poor clinical outcome and reduced survival of patients. Several approaches have been developed for targeting this pathway, for example TKr inhibitors (AZD6918, CEP-701) and RNA interference. The aim of the current review was to provide an overview of the role of BDNF/TrkB pathways in the pathogenesis of breast cancer and its value as a potential therapeutic target. J. Cell.

In this study, effects of PSC conditioned medium (PCM) on c-MET phosphorylation (by immunocytochemistry enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) and drug response (by sulforhodamine B assay) were investigated in five primary PDAC cells. In novel 3D-spheroid co-cultures of cyan fluorescence protein (CFP)-firefly luciferase (Fluc)-expressing primary human PDAC cells and green fluorescence protein (GFP)-expressing immortalized PSCs, PDAC cell growth and chemosensitivity were examined by luciferase assay, while spheroids' architecture was evaluated by confocal microscopy. The highest phospho-c-MET expression was detected in PDAC5 and its subclone sorted for "stage specific embryonic antigen-4" (PDAC5 (SSEA4)). PCM of cells pre-incubated with PDAC conditioned medium, containing increased hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) levels, made PDAC cells significantly more resistant to gemcitabine, but not to c-MET inhibitors. Hetero-spheroids containing both PSCs and PDAC5 (SSEA4) cells were more resistant to gemcitabine compared to PDAC5 (SSEA4) homo-spheroids. However, c-MET inhibitors (tivantinib, PHA-665752 and crizotinib) were equally effective in both spheroid models. Experiments with primary human PSCs confirmed the main findings. In conclusion, we developed spheroid models to evaluate PSC-PDAC reciprocal interaction, unraveling c-MET inhibition as an important therapeutic option against drug resistant PDAC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28409271>Unique presentation of cutis laxa with Leigh-like  due to ECHS1 deficiency.</a></h2><p>Clinical finding of cutis laxa, characterized by wrinkled, redundant, sagging, nonelastic skin, is of growing significance due to its occurrence in several different inborn errors of metabolism (IEM).  cutis laxa results from Menkes , caused by a defect in the ATPase copper transporting alpha (ATP7A) gene; congenital disorders of glycosylation due to mutations in subunit 7 of the component of oligomeric Golgi (COG7)-congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) complex; combined disorder of N- and O-linked glycosylation, due to mutations in ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit a2 (ATP6VOA2) gene; pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 deficiency; pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase deficiency; macrocephaly, alopecia, cutis laxa, and scoliosis (MACS) , due to Ras and Rab interactor 2 (RIN2) mutations; transaldolase deficiency caused by mutations in the transaldolase 1 (TALDO1) gene; Gerodermia osteodysplastica due to mutations in the golgin, RAB6-interacting (GORAB or SCYL1BP1) gene; and mitogen-activated pathway (MAP) kinase defects, caused by mutations in several genes [protein  phosphatase, non-receptor-type 11 (PTPN11), RAF, NF, HRas proto-oncogene, GTPase (HRAS), B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF), MEK1/2, KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase (KRAS), SOS Ras/Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2 (SOS2), leucine rich repeat scaffold protein (SHOC2), NRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase (NRAS), and Raf-1 proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (RAF1)], which regulate the Ras-MAPK cascade.

Biological endotypes using (n = 464 patients and controls), mBALF and serum samples were identified by high - resolution NMR spectroscopy from two clinically diagnosed ARDS subtypes grouped under mild, moderate and severe ARDS as subphenotype1and pulmonary and extra - pulmonary ARDS as subphenotype2.

There is controversy over whether obese "metabolically well" persons have a higher morbidity and mortality than lean counterparts, suggesting that MS criteria do not completely describe physiologic risk factors or consequences of obesity. We hypothesized that metabolomic analysis of plasma would distinguish obese individuals with and without MS and T2D along a spectrum of obesity-associated  derangements, supporting metabolomic analysis as a tool for a more detailed assessment of  wellness than currently used MS criteria.Fasting plasma samples from 90 adults were assigned to groups based on BMI and ATP III criteria for MS: (1) lean metabolically well (LMW;  = 24); (2) obese metabolically well (OBMW;  = 26); (3) obese metabolically unwell (OBMUW;  = 20); and (4) obese metabolically unwell with T2D (OBDM;  = 20). Forty-one amino acids/dipeptides, 33 acylcarnitines and 21 ratios were measured. Obesity and T2D effects were analyzed by Wilcoxon rank-sum tests comparing obese nondiabetics vs LMW, and OBDM vs nondiabetics, respectively.  unwellness was analyzed by Jonckheere-Terpstra trend tests, assuming worsening health from LMW → OBMW → OBMUW.

Cluster analysis did not separate subjects into discreet groups based on  wellness.Levels of 15 species and metabolite ratios trend significantly with worsening  health; some are newly recognized. BCAAs, aromatic amino acids, lysine, and its metabolite, alpha-aminoadipate, increase with worsening health. The lysine pathway is distinct from BCAA metabolism, indicating that biochemical derangements associated with MS involve pathways besides those affected by BCAAs. Even those considered "obese, metabolically well" had metabolite levels which significantly trended towards those found in obese diabetics. Overall, this analysis yields a more granular view of  wellness than the sole use of cardiometabolic MS parameters. This, in turn, suggests the possible utility of plasma metabolomic analysis for research and public health applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25325461>Chronic sleep fragmentation during the sleep period induces hypothalamic endoplasmic reticulum stress and PTP1b-mediated leptin resistance in male mice.</a></h2><p>Sleep fragmentation (SF) is highly prevalent and may constitute an important contributing factor to excessive weight gain and the . Increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) leading to the attenuation of leptin receptor signaling in the hypothalamus leads to obesity and  dysfunction.Mice were exposed to SF and sleep control (SC) for varying periods of time during which ingestive behaviors were monitored. UPR pathways and leptin receptor signaling were assessed in hypothalami. To further examine the mechanistic role of ER stress, changes in leptin receptor (ObR) signaling were also examined in wild-type mice treated with the ER chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), as well as in CHOP-/+ transgenic mice.Fragmented sleep in male mice induced increased food intake starting day 3 and thereafter, which was preceded by increases in ER stress and activation of all three UPR pathways in the hypothalamus. Although ObR expression was unchanged, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation was decreased, suggesting reduced ObR signaling. Unchanged suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) expression and increases in protein- phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) expression and activity emerged with SF, along with reduced p-STAT3 responses to exogenous leptin. SF-induced effects were reversed following TUDCA treatment and were absent in CHOP -/+ mice.SF induces hyperphagic behaviors and reduced leptin signaling in hypothalamus that are mediated by activation of ER stress, and ultimately lead to increased PTP1B activity. ER stress pathways are therefore potentially implicated in SF-induced weight gain and  dysfunction, and may represent a viable therapeutic target.© 2014 Associated Professional Sleep Societies, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27863851>Long-term exposition to a high fat diet favors the appearance of β-amyloid depositions in the brain of C57BL/6J mice. A potential model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease.</a></h2><p>The sporadic and late-onset form of Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes the most common form of dementia. This non-familiar form could be a consequence of , characterized by obesity and the development of a brain-specific insulin resistance known as type III diabetes. This work demonstrates the development of a significant AD-like neuropathology due to these  alterations.C57BL/6J mice strain were divided into two groups, one fed with a diet rich in palmitic acid (high-fat diet, HFD) since their weaning until 16 months of age, and another group used as a control with a regular diet. The analyses were carried out in the dentate gyrus area of the hippocampus using a Thioflavin-S stain and immunofluorescence assays.The most significant finding of the present research was that HFD induced the deposition of the βA peptide. Moreover, the diet also caused alterations in different cell processes, such as increased inflammatory reactions that lead to a decrease in the neuronal precursor cells. In addition, the results show that there were also dysregulations in normal autophagy and apoptosis, mechanisms related to βA formation.The present findings confirm that HFD favors the formation of βA depositions in the brain, a key feature of AD, supporting the  hypothesis of sporadic AD.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The current study examined the preventive role of exercise on defects in cardiac insulin signaling and function of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in fructose fed rats. Male Wistar rats were divided into control, sedentary fructose (received 10% fructose for 9 weeks) and exercise fructose (additionally exposed to low intensity exercise) groups. Concentration of triglycerides, glucose, insulin and visceral adipose tissue weight were determined to estimate  development. Expression and/or phosphorylation of cardiac insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), -specific protein phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), Akt, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and eNOS were evaluated. Fructose overload increased visceral adipose tissue, insulin concentration and homeostasis model assessment index. Exercise managed to decrease visceral adiposity and insulin level and to increase insulin sensitivity. Fructose diet increased level of cardiac PTP1B and pIRS1 (Ser307), while levels of IR and ERK1/2, as well as pIRS1 (Tyr 632), pAkt (Ser473, Thr308) and pERK1/2 were decreased. These disturbances were accompanied by reduced phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177. Exercise managed to prevent most of the disturbances in insulin signaling caused by fructose diet (except phosphorylation of IRS1 at Tyr 632 and phosphorylation and protein expression of ERK1/2) and consequently restored function of eNOS. Low intensity exercise could be considered as efficient treatment of cardiac insulin resistance induced by fructose diet.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

These effects may be exacerbated by pre-existing conditions such as diabetes or the presence of primary Raynaud's phenomena. The goal of these studies was to use an established model of vibration-induced injury in Zucker rats. Lean Zucker rats have a normal  profile, while obese Zucker rats display symptoms of  disorder or Type II diabetes. This study examined the effects of vibration in obese and lean rats. Zucker rats were exposed to 4h of vibration for 10 consecutive days at a frequency of 125 Hz and acceleration of 49 m/s(2) for 10 consecutive days. Sensory function was checked using transcutaneous electrical stimulation on days 1, 5 and 9 of the exposure. Once the study was complete the ventral tail nerves, dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord were dissected, and levels of various transcripts involved in sensorineural dysfunction were measured. Sensorineural dysfunction was assessed using transcutaneous electrical stimulation. Obese Zucker rats displayed very few changes in sensorineural function. However they did display significant changes in transcript levels for factors involved in synapse formation, peripheral nerve remodeling, and inflammation. The changes in transcript levels suggested that obese Zucker rats had some level of sensory nerve injury prior to exposure, and that exposure to vibration activated pathways involved in injury and re-innervation.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607147>Mechanisms of the Multitasking Endothelial Protein NRG-1 as a Compensatory Factor During Chronic Heart Failure.</a></h2><p>Heart failure is a complex  whose phenotypic presentation and disease progression depends on a complex network of adaptive and maladaptive responses.

NRG-1 features a multitasking profile tuning regenerative, inflammatory, fibrotic, and  processes. Here, we review the activities of NRG-1 on different cell types and organs and their implication for heart failure progression and its comorbidities. Although, in general, effects of NRG-1 in heart failure are compensatory and beneficial, translation into therapies remains unaccomplished both because of the complexity of the underlying pathways and because of the challenges in the development of therapeutics (proteins, peptides, small molecules, and RNA-based therapies) for  kinase receptors.

This is a convenient model for studying diabetes-induced cardiomyopathy independently from the effects of the . We investigated the myocardial functional and structural changes and underlying molecular pathomechanisms of short-term and mild T2DM. The presence of DM was confirmed by an impaired oral glucose tolerance in the GK rats compared with the age-matched nondiabetic Wistar rats. Data from cardiac catheterization showed that in GK rats, although the systolic indexes were not altered, the diastolic stiffness was increased compared with nondiabetics (end-diastolic-pressure-volume-relationship: 0.12 ± 0.04 vs. 0.05 ± 0.01 mmHg/μl, P < 0.05). Additionally, DM was associated with left-ventricular hypertrophy and histological evidence of increased myocardial fibrosis. The plasma pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, the cardiac troponin-T, glucose, and the urinary glucose concentrations were significantly higher in GK rats. Among the 125 genes surveyed using PCR arrays, DM significantly altered the expression of five genes [upregulation of natriuretic peptide precursor-A and connective tissue growth factor, downregulation of c-reactive protein, interleukin-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α mRNA-level]. Of the altered genes, which were evaluated by Western blot, only TNF-α protein expression was significantly decreased. The ECG recordings revealed no significant differences. In conclusion, while systolic dysfunction, myocardial inflammation, and abnormal electrical conduction remain absent, short-term and mild T2DM induce the alteration of cardiac TNF-α at both the mRNA and protein levels. Further assessments are required to reveal if TNF-α plays a role in the early stage of diabetic cardiomyopathy development.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26293481>Homeostatic effect of p-chloro-diphenyl diselenide on glucose metabolism and mitochondrial function alterations induced by monosodium glutamate administration to rats.</a></h2><p>The  is a group of  alterations considered a worldwide public health problem. Organic selenium compounds have been reported to have many different pharmacological actions, such as anti-hypercholesterolemic and anti-hyperglycemic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of p-chloro-diphenyl diselenide (p-ClPhSe)2, an organic selenium compound, in a model of obesity induced by monosodium glutamate (MSG) administration in rats. The rats were treated during the first ten postnatal days with MSG and received (p-ClPhSe)2 (10 mg/kg, intragastrically) from 45th to 51 th postnatal day. Glucose, lipid and lactate levels were determined in plasma of rats. Glycogen levels and activities of  aminotransferase, hexokinase, citrate synthase and glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase) were determined in livers of rats. Renal G-6-Pase activity was also determined. The purine content [Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate] and mitochondrial functionality in the liver were also investigated. p-(ClPhSe)2 did not alter the reduction in growth performance and in the body weight caused by MSG but reduced epididymal fat deposition of rats. p-(ClPhSe)2 restored glycemia, triglycerides, cholesterol and lactate levels as well as the glucose metabolism altered in rats treated with MSG. p-(ClPhSe)2 restored hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction and the decrease in citrate synthase activity and ATP and ADP levels caused by MSG in rats.

Review of the literature.</a></h2><p>Fetuin-A, also called Alpha 2-Heremans Schmid Glycoprotein, is a multifunctional plasma agent what has been proven in animal and human studies. It plays a role as a physiological inhibitor of insulin receptor  kinase associated with insulin resistance and a negative acute phase reactant. It also regulates bone remodeling and calcium metabolism being an important inhibitor of calcium salt precipitation and vascular calcifications.PubMed database was searched for articles from 2002 up to December 2014 to identify the role of fetuin-A in the pathogenesis of selected internal diseases.Due to secretion of fetuin-A mainly by the liver, it may be a marker of liver function and predictor of mortality in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer. The associations between high fetuin-A and  as well as its hepatic manifestation- nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and atherogenic lipid profile have been well proven. However, fetuin-A relation with BMI is not so clear. Contrary to few reports, many authors suggest that fetuin-A may be an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes and marker of diabetic complications. Close associations of high and low fetuin-A concentrations with cardiovascular diseases and mortality risk have been reported which is explained by differences in analyzed populations, stages of atherosclerosis and calcifications, coexistence of type 2 diabetes or kidney dysfunction and different main pathways of fetuin-A actions in various diseases.Fetuin-A has a diagnostic potential as a biomarker for liver dysfunction, cardiovascular diseases and disorders associated with .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28743892>DYRK1B mutations associated with  impair the chaperone-dependent maturation of the kinase domain.</a></h2><p>Two missense mutations of the DYRK1B gene have recently been found to co-segregate with a rare autosomal-dominant form of . This gene encodes a member of the DYRK family of protein kinases, which depend on  autophosphorylation to acquire the catalytically active conformation. The mutations (H90P and R102C) affect a structural element named DYRK homology (DH) box and did not directly interfere with the conformation of the catalytic domain in a structural model of DYRK1B. Cellular assays showed that the mutations did not alter the specific activity of mature kinase molecules. However, a significant part of the mutant DYRK1B protein accumulated in detergent-insoluble cytoplasmic aggregates and was underphosphorylated on . The mutant DYRK1B variants were more vulnerable to the HSP90 inhibitor ganetespib and showed enhanced binding to the co-chaperone CDC37 as compared to wild type DYRK1B. These results support the hypothesis that the mutations in the DH box interfere with the maturation of DYRK1B by  autophosphorylation and compromise the conformational stability of the catalytic domain, which renders the kinase susceptible to misfolding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25652368>[Metabonomic analysis of the serum from rat model with abnormal balgam  of Uyghur medicine].</a></h2><p>To investigate correlation between the change in  components of serum and the abnormal balgam  by using a rat model of abnormal balgam .Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into a control group and a test group.

Because browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) is protective against obesity-related  disease, we examined sex differences in β3-adrenergic remodeling of WAT in mice.Effects of the β3-adrenergic receptor agonist CL316,243 (CL) on browning of white adipose tissue were investigated in male and female C57BL mice. The role of ovarian hormones in female-specific browning was studied in control female C57BL mice and mice with ovarian failure induced by 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide treatment for 15 days.We found that treatment with CL-induced upregulation of brown adipocyte markers and mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins in gonadal WAT (gWAT) of female mice, but was without effect in males. In contrast, CL treatment was equally effective in males and females in inducing brown adipocyte phenotypes in inguinal WAT. The tissue- and sex-specific differences in brown adipocyte recruitment were correlated with differences in sympathetic innervation, as determined by  hydroxylase immunostaining and western blotting. Levels of the neurotrophins NGF and BDNF were significantly higher in gWAT of female mice. CL treatment significantly increased NGF levels in gWAT of female mice but did not affect BDNF expression. In contrast, estradiol treatment doubled BDNF expression in female adipocytes differentiated in vitro. Ovarian failure induced by 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide treatment dramatically reduced BDNF and TH expression in gWAT, eliminated induction of UCP1 by CL, and reduced tissue  rate.Collectively, these data demonstrate that female mice are more responsive than males to the recruitment of brown adipocytes in gonadal WAT and this difference corresponds to greater levels of estrogen-dependent sympathetic innervation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26405068>Genetics of Autoimmune Thyroiditis in Type 1 Diabetes Reveals a Novel Association With DPB1*0201: Data From the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium.</a></h2><p>Autoimmune thyroiditis occurs in 10-25% of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Most of these patients are also positive for thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies. Thyroid dysfunction complicates T1D  control and is a component of the autoimmune polyglandular  (APS, type 2 or 3). Previous studies of isolated T1D and of T1D combined with other autoimmune disorders showed genetic susceptibility for alleles in HLA-DQB1 and -DRB1 and also CTLA4 and PTPN22.We analyzed the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium Autoantibody Workshop data by differentiating those T1D probands with and without TPO antibodies or thyroid disease with respect to polymorphisms in HLA, CTLA4, INS, PTPN22, and VDR, taking into account the ethnic origin. Genotype and clinical/immunogenic phenotype data were analyzed by gene counting methods and logistic regression analysis.The presence of TPO antibodies (25.2%) and thyroid disease (8.4%) was associated with older age, female sex, and presence of other autoantibodies (GAD65, ATPase, 21-OH) (all P<0.001). The highest prevalence was in patients of Hispanic ancestry (31%) and the lowest in those of African ancestry (8%). In T1D non-Hispanic whites, HLA-DRB1*0101 is significantly (P<0.0001) less frequent in TPO-positive than in TPO-negative individuals, whereas HLA-DRB1*0404, -DQB1*0301, and -DPB1*0201 are significantly (P<0.0001) more frequent. Subjects with a high titer of TPO autoantibodies and with thyroid disease were associated with female sex and older age and negatively associated with DRB1*0401-DQB1*0302 (P<0.0001). No significant differences were observed for an association of TPO positivity or thyroid disease with single nucleotide polymorphisms in the INS, CTLA4, or VDR loci, with nominal significance (P=0.01) for PTPN22 R620W variant.Thyroid autoimmunity is highly prevalent in T1D patients of non-Hispanic white, Asian, or Hispanic origin. The strongest disease risk is conferred by female sex and older age. This risk is modulated by HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DPB1 loci.

DYRK1B is activated by cis auto-phosphorylation on -273 (Y273) within the activation loop during translation but few other DYRK1B phosphorylation sites have been characterised to date. Here, we demonstrate that DYRK1B also undergoes trans-autophosphorylation on serine-421 (S421) in vitro and in cells and that this site contributes to DYRK1B kinase activity. Whilst a DYRK1B(S421A) mutant was completely defective for p-S421 in cells, DYRK1B inhibitors caused only a partial loss of p-S421 suggesting the existence of an additional kinase that could also phosphorylate DYRK1B S421. Indeed, a catalytically inactive DYRK1B(D239A) mutant exhibited very low levels of p-S421 in cells but this was increased by KRAS(G12V). In addition, selective activation of the RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signalling pathway rapidly increased p-S421 in cells whereas activation of the stress kinases JNK or p38 could not. S421 resides within a Ser-Pro phosphoacceptor motif that is typical for ERK1/2 and recombinant ERK2 phosphorylated DYRK1B at S421 in vitro. Our results show that DYRK1B is a novel ERK2 substrate, uncovering new links between two kinases involved in cell fate decisions.

She has a history of partial bicornuate uterus and had a previous miscarriage in the first trimester. Pre-conception, her median blood PHE was 462 μmol/L but throughout pregnancy the median reduced to 258 μmol/L. GMP provided 30 g/day protein equivalent (46 mg/day PHE). Total protein equivalent from PS increased from 58 to 86 g/day during pregnancy but AA provided all additional protein equivalent intake. Both GMP and AA were well tolerated with no morning sickness. Normal morphologic evaluation and adequate fetal growth with cephalic biometry near the 5th percentile was determined. The infant was born at 39.3 weeks: weight 2570 g (3rd percentile), length 47.5 cm (10th percentile) and head circumference (HC) of 31.5 cm (1st percentile). In the neonatal period, the infant had craniofacial dimorphism with metopic suture prominence. Father also had bitemporal narrowing. By 12 months of age, the infant's weight (15th percentile), length (50th percentile) and HC (10th-50th percentile) were normal although bitemporal narrowing persisted.This is the first case reporting the use of GMP in MPKU. Its PHE content did not adversely affect  control although it only provided part of the PS intake. Some intrauterine development delay occurred in the last trimester, although we consider that this is unlikely to be associated with MPKU  or the use of GMP. More published data is essential to examine the impact of using GMP in MPKU on morning sickness severity and aversion, maternal weight gain, blood amino acid concentrations and variability of blood PHE concentrations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27068762> product response profiles of Cherax quadricarinatus towards white spot  virus infection.</a></h2><p>White spot  virus (WSSV) is one of the most devastating viral pathogens in both shrimp and crayfish farms, which often causes disease outbreak and leads to massive moralities with significant economic losses of aquaculture. However, limited research has been carried out on the intrinsic mechanisms toward WSSV challenge at the  level. To gain comprehensive insight into  responses induced by WSSV, we applied an NMR approach to investigate  changes of crayfish gill and hepatopancreas infected by WSSV for 1, 6 and 12 h. In gill, an enhanced energy metabolism was observed in WSSV-challenged crayfish samples at 1 h, as marked by increased glucose, alanine, methionine, glutamate and uracil.

Antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG) is a leading factor of patient non-compliance and has previously been shown to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, , and cardiovascular events. The current study intends to replicate findings from a recent genome-wide association study in Han-Chinese patients implicating two gene variants (rs10977144 and rs10977154) of the protein  phosphatase receptor type D (PTPRD) in antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG). We investigated a sample of European and African American ancestry (n = 201) and calculated percentage of weight change using linear regression corrected for type of antipsychotics, duration of treatment and principal components from ancestry checks. As secondary goal, we investigated additional gene variants of PTPRD previously not associated with AIWG. We found no association with rs10977144 and rs10977154. However, we found nominally significant results between PTPRD and AIWG with rs73398242 in Europeans (BETA = - 0.267, p = 0.002) and rs13294608 in African Americans (BETA = 0.423, p = 0.003).

Each underwent euglycemic insulin clamps and a thigh muscle biopsy before and after 8 weeks of either strength or endurance training. Muscle IRS-1 phosphorylation at six sites was quantified by immunoblots.  muscle IRS-1 had excess phosphorylation at Ser337 and Ser636 but not at Ser307, Ser789, or Ser1101. Ser337 is a target for phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and Ser636 is phosphorylated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1). Exercise training without weight loss did not change the IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. These data suggest that baseline hyperphosphorylation of at least two key serines within muscle IRS-1 diminishes the transmission of the insulin signal and thereby decreases the insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4. Excess fasting phosphorylation of muscle IRS-1 at Ser636 may be a major cause of the insulin resistance seen in obesity and might prevent improvement in insulin responsiveness when exercise training is not accompanied by weight loss.© 2014 The Authors.

To better understand the contribution of genetic variation to amino acid levels, we performed single variant and gene-based tests of association between nine serum amino acids (alanine, glutamine, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, , and valine) and 16.6 million genotyped and imputed variants in 8545 non-diabetic Finnish men from the  In Men (METSIM) study with replication in Northern Finland Birth Cohort (NFBC1966). We identified five novel loci associated with amino acid levels (P = < 5×10-8): LOC157273/PPP1R3B with glycine (rs9987289, P = 2.3×10-26); ZFHX3 (chr16:73326579, minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.42%, P = 3.6×10-9), LIPC (rs10468017, P = 1.5×10-8), and WWOX (rs9937914, P = 3.8×10-8) with alanine; and TRIB1 with  (rs28601761, P = 8×10-9). Gene-based tests identified two novel genes harboring missense variants of MAF <1% that show aggregate association with amino acid levels: PYCR1 with glycine (Pgene = 1.5×10-6) and BCAT2 with valine (Pgene = 7.4×10-7); neither gene was implicated by single variant association tests. These findings are among the first applications of gene-based tests to identify new loci for amino acid levels. In addition to the seven novel gene associations, we identified five independent signals at established amino acid loci, including two rare variant signals at GLDC (rs138640017, MAF=0.95%, Pconditional = 5.8×10-40) with glycine levels and HAL (rs141635447, MAF = 0.46%, Pconditional = 9.4×10-11) with histidine levels. Examination of all single variant association results in our data revealed a strong inverse relationship between effect size and MAF (Ptrend<0.001). These novel signals provide further insight into the molecular mechanisms of amino acid metabolism and potentially, their perturbations in disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28861973>[Prescription of Jingdan Yimin for treatment of ].</a></h2><p>Based on the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, modern methods for drug investigation such as molecular targets in vitro and effects in vivo were used to study the prescription of Jingdan Yimin(JD), including selection of raw materials, composition, proportion, and effective dose of the compounds for treatment of . The IRF mice models, characterized by insulin resistance and hypercholesterolemia, were induced by high fat diet. The insulin sensitivity was estimated with insulin tolerance test(ITT) and glucose tolerance test(GTT); the levels of blood glucose and total cholesterol(TC), and the activities of α-glucosidase, protein  phosphatase 1B(PTP1B), and fructose phosphate amide transferase(GFAT)were measured with biochemical methods, respectively. The sample H13(h) extracted from Rhodiola crenulata, Y12(y) from Cordyceps militaris, and D(d) from Rheum palmatum were selected according to the inhibition activity on both PTP1B and α-glucosidase in vitro, regulation on hypercholesterolemia in IRF mice, and effects on GFAT activity, respectively; their synergistic effects on the treatment of  were determined in IRF mice; composition proportion of h∶y∶d was measured in accordance with the results of L8(27) orthogonal experiments targeting on the inhibition of both PTP1B and α-glucosidase; finally, the effective dose was assessed based on the effects on IGT and hypercholesterolemia, respectively, in IRF mice. In conclusion, the prescription JD is composed by R. crenulata, C. militaris, and R. palmatum with the rate of 20∶1∶1, and its effective oral dose is 200 mg•kg⁻¹ for treatment of ; its main mechanism is to inhibit the targets PTP1B and α-glucosidase.

This system is activa- ted by leptin produced by adipocytes and then penetrates into brain through the blood-brain barrier, where leptin binds to leptin receptors OBRb. This leads to activation of  kinase JAK2, which phosphory- lates -containing sites located in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor, resulting in stimulation of activity of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, the transcription factors STAT3 and STAT5, phosphatase SHP2, and mitogen-activated protein kinase. Decrease in number of functionally active leptin receptors and disturbances in the downstream components of leptin cascades in neuronal cells lead to development of leptin resistance. Since the leptin system in hypothalamic neurons is closely linked to the insulin, mela- nocortin, dopaminergic and other signaling systems, leptin resistance induces a lot of functional disorders in the CNS and on the periphery. The restoration of the brain leptin system functions is one of the promi- sing approaches to treatment and prevention of  disorders, including MS and DM2. The review analyzes data on structural and functional organization of the leptin signaling system, its functional, interaction with other brain signaling systems, the causes and effects of central leptin resistance, as well as the approaches to restore the functions of the hypothalamic leptin system in MS and DM2.

TLS generally follows chemotherapy of rapidly proliferating haematological malignancies; spontaneous TLS and TLS from treatment of solid tumours are infrequently reported. We present a rare case of TLS following treatment of a large gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) in a 63- year-old man. Imatinib was started for tumour size reduction prior to surgical intervention and in 5 days the patient developed  derangements consistent with TLS. Imatinib was held and fluids, allopurinol and rasburicase were started. All  abnormalities resolved in 3 days. Imatinib was restarted, and he eventually underwent surgical intervention. This is the second case demonstrating successful reinitiation of imatinib following TLS when treating GIST. We highlight the importance of risk factor assessment and need for pre-emptive therapy to prevent TLS when using  kinase inhibitor therapy.© BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2018. No commercial re-use.

This study investigated whether fructose caused insulin signaling impairment in podocyte dysfunction and injury, and whether curcumin reduced these disturbances.Rats were fed with 10% fructose for 6 weeks and then orally cotreated with curcumin for next 6 weeks. , podocyte injury, microRNA expression, and insulin signaling were evaluated. Curcumin significantly alleviated fructose-induced podocyte injury and proteinuria, miR-206 low-expression, protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) overexpression, as well as downregulation of insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate 1, caveolin-1, protein kinase B, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 phosphorylation in kidney cortex or glomeruli of fructose-fed rats. These effects were further confirmed in cultured differentiated podocytes exposed to 5 mM fructose in the presence or absence of curcumin, PTP1B siRNA, lentivirus-mediated PTP1B recombinant overexpression, miR-206 mimic, or miR-206 inhibitor transfection, showing that miR-206 upregulation may contribute to improve insulin signaling through regulating PTP1B expression.Curcumin is suggested to activate miR-206 expression to downregulate PTP1B, and then improve insulin signaling, protect against fructose-induced glomerular podocyte injury, and proteinuria, which may provide new evidence regarding curcumin's effects on fructose-associated podocyte injury.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of HO-1 in hepatic lipid metabolism.Functional studies were performed using C57BL/6J (WT) mice and Sirt1 liver specific mutant (Sirt1-deficient) mice. The molecular mechanism was explored in primary hepatocytes and mouse liver.Chronic exposure to high-fat diet (HFD) induced hepatic steatosis in WT mice. Treatment of WT mice on HFD with cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP), an inducer of HO-1 activity, decreased body weight and visceral fat content, reduced intracellular hepatic triglyceride and serum total cholesterol concentrations, and decreased liver lipid droplet formation. Compared with WT mice, the administration of CoPP to Sirt1-deficient mice on HFD increased visceral fat content, and slightly promoted liver lipid droplet formation. CoPP improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in WT mice on HFD, but compromised insulin sensitivity in Sirt1-deficient mice on HFD. Furthermore, CoPP-induced Sirt1 expression and decreased sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) expression in WT mice on HFD. However, CoPP promoted SREBP-1c expression in Sirt1-deficient hepatocytes, which was reversed by a protein  phosphatase 1b inhibitor. Additionally, while the administration of CoPP to WT mice on HFD improved antioxidant and anti-inflammatory states, these CoPP-mediated effects were abolished in Sirt1-deficient mice.Sirt1 mediates the effect of CoPP on ameliorating liver  damage caused by HFD.Copyright © 2015 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

However, recurrent neurological crises are another main finding in these patients when they are treated with a  and phenylalanine restricted diet only. This is caused by the accumulation of δ-aminolevulinic acid due to the inhibitory effect of succinylacetone on the enzyme that metabolizes δ-aminolevulinic acid. Due to the biochemical and clinical resemblance of these neurological crises and acute intermittent porphyria, this group of symptoms in HTI patients is mostly called porphyria-like-. The neurological crises in HTI patients disappeared after the introduction of treatment with 2-(2 nitro-4-3 trifluoro-methylbenzoyl)-1, 3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC). However, if NTBC treatment is stopped for a while, severe neurological dysfunction will reappear.If NTBC treatment is started early and given continuously, all clinical problems seem to be solved. However, recent research findings indicate that HTI patients have a non-optimal neurocognitive outcome, showing (among others) a lower IQ and impaired executive functioning and social cognition. Unfortunately the exact neuropsychological profile of these HTI patients is not known yet, neither are the exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these impairments. It may be hypothesized that the biochemical changes such as high blood  or low blood phenylalanine concentrations are important in this respect, but an direct toxic effect of NTBC or production of toxic metabolites (that previously characterized the disease before introduction of NTBC) cannot be excluded either. This chapter discusses the neurological and neuropsychological symptoms associated with HTI in detail.

Additionally, DS-A was split into five fractions in descending order of polarity, which were utilized to illustrate the mechanism together. The 26 identified biomarkers were mainly related to disturbances in phenylalanine, , tryptophan, purine, arginine, and proline metabolism. Furthermore, heat map, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and correlation network diagram of biomarkers perturbed by modeling were all conducted. The results of heat map and HCA suggested that fat oil fraction could reverse the abnormal metabolism in the model to some extent; meanwhile the  inhibitory effect produced by the other four fractions helped to relieve cardiac load and compensate the insufficient energy supplement induced by the existing heart and lung injury in model rats. Briefly, the split fractions interfered with the model from different aspects and ultimately constituted the overall effects of extract. In conclusion, the metabolomics method, combined with split fractions of extract, is a powerful approach for illustrating pathologic changes of Chinese medicine  and action mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26658589>Alterations in the levels of plasma amino acids in polycystic ovary --A pilot study.</a></h2><p>Plasma amino acid levels are known to be altered in conditions like sepsis and burns which are situations of  stress. Polycystic ovary  (PCOS), a condition which affects a woman throughout her life, is said to be associated with  stress. This study was undertaken to assess if there were significant alterations in the levels of plasma amino acids in women with PCOS.Sixty five women with PCOS along with the similar number of age matched normal controls were included in this study. Levels of 14 amino acids were determined using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography.The levels of methionine, cystine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, valine, , proline, glycine, lysine and histidine were found to be significantly (P<0.001) lower in cases than in controls. Arginine and alanine levels were found to be significantly (P<0.001) higher in cases compared with controls.Our findings showed significant derangement in the levels of plasma amino acids in women with PCOS which might be due to the oxidative and  stress associated with it.

MerTK is mainly expressed in anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages where it mediates transcriptional changes including suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and enhancement of inflammatory repressors. MerTK is regulated by  pathways through nuclear sensors including LXRs, PPARs, and RXRs, in response to apoptotic bodies or to other sources of cholesterol. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most serious public health problems worldwide. It is a clinicopathological  closely related to obesity, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. It includes a spectrum of conditions ranging from simple steatosis, characterized by hepatic fat accumulation with or without inflammation, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), defined by hepatic fat deposition with hepatocellular damage, inflammation, and accumulating fibrosis. Several studies support an association between NAFLD and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis, a major cause of death worldwide. This pathological condition consists in a chronic and progressive inflammatory process in the intimal layer of large- and medium-sized arteries. The complications of advanced atherosclerosis include chronic or acute ischemic damage in the tissue perfused by the affected artery, leading to cellular death. By identifying specific targets influencing lipid metabolism and cardiovascular-related diseases, the present review highlights the role of MerTK in NAFLD-associated atherosclerotic lesions as a potential innovative therapeutic target. Therapeutic advantages might derive from the use of compounds selective for nuclear receptors targeting PPARs rather than LXRs regulating macrophage lipid metabolism and macrophage mediated inflammation, by favoring the expression of MerTK, which mediates an immunoregulatory action with a reduction in inflammation and in atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25905300>Pathophysiology and Treatment of Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (PNETs): New Developments.</a></h2><p>Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are on the increase.

Tumor markers remain essential in the diagnosis and follow-up of these patients. Major clinical advances have occurred in pathology/classification/staging, imaging (68 Gallium DOTATE PET), the development of additional somatostatin analogues, cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted therapies (e.g.  kinase inhibitor sunitinib and mTOR inhibitor everolimus), other modalities (e.g. peptide receptor radiotherapy), and quality of life assessment. These are very hopeful times for patients who have these tumors and their physicians. Issues to be considered when choosing among the plethora of effective treatment options include toxicity and cost, effects on quality of life, and the age and overall health of the patient.

While the mechanism of PEDF induced-insulin resistance of  disorders has been attributed to its inflammatory and lipolytic effects, little evidence exists to support a direct role of PEDF in mediating insulin resistance. Here, we seminally provide evidence that PEDF can inhibit insulin signal transduction governing glucose homeostasis from the receptor to the effector phosphorylation through Akt/PKB-dependent and -independent pathways in mouse and human skeletal muscle cell lines. PEDF attenuates the insulin-dependent molecular axes of glucose metabolism. Exposure of skeletal myocytes to PEDF attenuates insulin-dependent insulin receptor autophosphorylation,  phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1, and dual loop phosphorylation-activation of Akt. PEDF significantly inhibits the downstream effector - glycogen synthase kinase (and thereby the glycogenic axis of insulin signalling). PEDF turned off both the molecular switches of GLUT4 translocation: IRS-Akt/PKB-AS160 mediated and IR-pCbl-dependent GLUT4 translocation (the molecular axis of glucose uptake). These findings implicate a direct effect of PEDF on multiple insulin-dependent molecular mechanisms of glucose homeostasis in skeletal muscle cells, thereby enabling it to contribute to peripheral insulin resistance at the cellular level.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We have integrated proteome and metabolome data sets for a holistic view of the molecular mechanisms in disease. Using quantitative iTRAQ-LC-MS/MS proteomics coupled with UPLC-Q-TOF-HDMS based metabolomics, we determined the protein and metabolite expression changes in the kidney-yang deficiency  (KYDS) rat model and further investigated the intervention effects of the Jinkui Shenqi Pill (JSP). The VIP-plot of the orthogonal PLS-DA (OPLS-DA) was used for discovering the potential biomarkers to clarify the therapeutic mechanisms of JSP in treating KYDS. The results showed that JSP can alleviate the kidney impairment induced by KYDS. Sixty potential biomarkers, including 5-l-glutamyl-taurine, phenylacetaldehyde, 4,6-dihydroxyquinoline, and xanthurenic acid etc., were definitely up- or down-regulated. The regulatory effect of JSP on the disturbed  pathways was proved by the established metabonomic method. Using pathway analyses, we identified the disturbed  pathways such as taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism,  metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, histidine metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, etc. Furthermore, using iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics analysis, seventeen differential proteins were identified and significantly altered by the JSP treatment. These proteins appear to be involved in Wnt, chemokine, PPAR, and MAPK signaling pathways, etc. Functional pathway analysis revealed that most of the proteins were found to play a key role in the regulation of metabolism pathways. Bioinformatics analysis with the IPA software found that these differentially-expressed moleculars had a strong correlation with the α-adrenergic signaling, FGF signaling, etc. Our data indicate that high-throughput metabolomics and proteomics can provide an insight on the herbal preparations affecting the  disorders using high resolution mass spectrometry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29904335>Neuroprotection Targeting Protein Misfolding on Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion in the Context of .</a></h2><p> (MetS) is a cluster of risk factors that lead to microvascular dysfunction and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). Long-standing reduction in oxygen and energy supply leads to brain hypoxia and protein misfolding, thereby linking CCH to Alzheimer's disease. Protein misfolding results in neurodegeneration as revealed by studying different experimental models of CCH. Regulating proteostasis network through pathways like the unfolded protein response (UPR), the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), and macroautophagy emerges as a novel target for neuroprotection. Lipoxin A4 methyl ester, baclofen, URB597, N-stearoyl-, and melatonin may pose potential neuroprotective agents for rebalancing the proteostasis network under CCH. Autophagy is one of the most studied pathways of proteostatic cell response against the decrease in blood supply to the brain though the role of the UPR-specific chaperones and the UPS system in CCH deserves further research.

The objective was therefore to assess insulin and amino acid responses following intake of a high protein meal in healthy horses and those with EMS. Six mature horses diagnosed with EMS and six age-matched control horses without EMS were used. Horses were fed 2g/kg body mass (BM) of a high protein pellet (31% crude protein) at time 0 and 30min, for a total of 4g/kg BM, following an overnight fast. Blood samples collected during a 4h period were analysed for plasma glucose, insulin, amino acids and urea concentrations. Glucose concentrations were not different between groups (P=0.2). Horses with EMS had a 9-fold greater insulinemic response to the consumption of a high protein meal compared with controls (P=0.046). Post-prandial levels of histidine, citrulline, , valine, methionine, isoleucine, leucine and ornithine were higher in horses with EMS (P<0.05). Baseline urea nitrogen concentrations were not significantly different between groups (P=0.1). Knowing that certain amino acids are insulin secretagogues, these results illustrate that consumption of a high protein meal caused a hyperinsulinemic response and affected amino acid dynamics in horses with EMS. These findings suggest that dietary protein content should be taken into consideration in the management of horses with insulin dysregulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to test whether H. perforatum L. extract (EHP) has an effect on , we treated diet induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6J mice with the extract. The chemical characters of EHP were investigated with thin-layer chromatography, ultraviolet, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and HPLC-mass spectrometry fingerprint analysis. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), insulin tolerance test (ITT), and the glucose infusion rate (GIR) in hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp test were performed to evaluate the glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Skeletal muscle was examined for lipid metabolism. The results suggest that EHP can significantly improve the glucose and lipid metabolism in DIO mice. In vitro, EHP inhibited the catalytic activity of recombinant human protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and reduced the protein and mRNA levels of PTP1B in the skeletal muscle. Moreover, expressions of genes related to fatty acid uptake and oxidation were changed by EHP in the skeletal muscle. These results suggest that EHP may improve insulin resistance and lipid metabolism in DIO mice.© 2014 The Authors.

Activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an effective approach for treating diabetes, and reduced insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) protein levels have been suggested as a molecular mechanism causing insulin resistance. Thus, dual targeting of AMPK and IRS-1 might provide an ideal way to treat diabetes.

Here we describe 14 individuals from 11 families presenting with sideroblastic anemia and  variants that we identified using a sideroblastic anemia gene panel or exome sequencing. The phenotype of these patients ranged from MLASA to isolated congenital sideroblastic anemia. As in previous cases, inter- and intra-familial phenotypic variability was observed, however, this report includes the first cases with isolated sideroblastic anemia and patients with biallelic  variants that have no clinically ascertainable phenotype. We identified ten novel  variants and three previously reported variants.  amino-acylation assays of five novel missense variants showed that three had less effect on the catalytic activity of YARS2 than the most commonly reported variant, p.(Phe52Leu), associated with MLASA2, which may explain the milder phenotypes in patients with these variants. However, the other two missense variants had a more severe effect on YARS2 catalytic efficiency. Several patients carried the common  c.572 G>T, p.(Gly191Val) variant (minor allele frequency =0.1259) in  with a rare deleterious  variant. We have previously shown that the p.(Gly191Val) variant reduces YARS2 catalytic activity. Consequently, we suggest that biallelic  variants, including severe loss-of-function alleles in  of the common p.(Gly191Val) variant, should be considered as a cause of isolated congenital sideroblastic anemia, as well as the MLASA syndromic phenotype.Copyright© 2018 Ferrata Storti Foundation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31385064>Early weaning alters the thermogenic capacity of brown adipose tissue in adult male and female rats.</a></h2><p>Early weaning (EW) is a risk factor for obesity development. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) hypofunction is related to obesity onset. Here, we evaluated whether sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity in BAT and the thermogenic function of BAT are decreased in adulthood in obese rats from two EW models.At the time of birth, lactating Wistar rats and their pups (three males and three females) were separated into three groups: the control group, in which pups consumed milk throughout lactation; the non-pharmacological EW (NPEW) group, in which suckling was interrupted with a bandage during the last 3 days of lactation; and the pharmacological EW (PEW) group, in which dams were treated with bromocriptine (0.5 mg/twice a day) 3 days before weaning. The offspring were sacrificed on PN180.Adult male rats from both EW models exhibited lower BAT SNS activity. Female rats from the PEW group showed a decrease in BAT SNS activity. The protein levels of UCP1 were lower in the NPEW males, while PGC1α levels were lower in both PEW and NPEW males. Both groups of EW females showed reductions in the levels of β3-AR, TRβ1, and PGC1α. The UCP1 protein level was reduced only in the NPEW females. The EW groups of both sexes had lower AMPK protein levels in BAT. In the hypothalamus, only the PEW females showed an increase in AMPK protein levels. In both groups of EW males, adrenal catecholamine was increased and  hydroxylase was decreased, while in EW females, adrenal catecholamine was decreased.Early weaning alters the thermogenic capacity of BAT, which partially contributes to obesity in adulthood, and there are sex-related differences in these alterations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961194>Therapeutic Effect and  Mechanism of A Selenium-Polysaccharide from  Green Tea on Chronic Fatigue .</a></h2><p> green tea was considered a medicine food homology plant to improve chronic fatigue Ssyndrome (CFS) in China. The aim of this research was to study the therapeutic effect of selenium-polysaccharides (Se-TP) from  green tea on CFS and explore its  mechanism. A CFS-rats model was established in the present research and Se-TP was administrated to evaluate the therapeutic effect on CFS. Some serum metabolites including blood urea nitrogen (BUN), blood lactate acid (BLA), corticosterone (CORT), and aldosterone (ALD) were checked. Urine metabolites were analyzed via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Multivariate statistical analysis was also used to check the data. The results selected biomarkers that were entered into the MetPA database to analyze their corresponding  pathways. The results demonstrated that Se-TP markedly improved the level of BUN and CORT in CFS rats. A total of eight differential metabolites were detected in GC-MS analysis, which were benzoic acid, itaconic acid, glutaric acid, 4-acetamidobutyric acid, creatine, 2-hydroxy-3-isopropylbutanedioic acid, l-dopa, and 21-hydroxypregnenolone. These differential metabolites were entered into the MetPA database to search for the corresponding  pathways and three related  pathways were screened out. The first pathway was steroid hormone biosynthesis. The second was  metabolism, and the third was arginine-proline metabolism. The 21-hydroxypregnenolone level of rats in the CFS group markedly increased after the Se-TP administration. In conclusion, Se-TP treatments on CFS rats improved their condition. Its  mechanism was closely related to that which regulates the steroid hormone biosynthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29087480>Myeloid adrenergic signaling via CaMKII forms a feedforward loop of catecholamine biosynthesis.</a></h2><p>Type 2 immune response has been shown to facilitate cold-induced thermogenesis and browning of white fat. However, whether alternatively activated macrophages produce catecholamine and substantially promote adaptive thermogenesis in adipose tissue remains controversial. Here, we show that  hydroxylase (TyrH), a rate-limiting enzyme of catecholamine biosynthesis, was expressed and phosphorylated in adipose-resident macrophages. In addition, the plasma level of adrenaline was increased by cold stress in mice, and treatment of macrophages with adrenaline stimulated phosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and TyrH. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of CaMKII or PKA signaling diminished adrenaline-induced phosphorylation of TyrH in primary macrophages. Consistently, overexpression of constitutively active CaMKII upregulated basal TyrH phosphorylation, while suppressing the stimulatory effect of adrenaline on TyrH in macrophages. Myeloid-specific disruption of CaMKIIγ suppressed both the cold-induced production of norepinephrine and adipose UCP1 expression in vivo and the stimulatory effect of adrenaline on macrophage-dependent activation of brown adipocytes in vitro. Lack of CaMKII signaling attenuated catecholamine production mediated by cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, key inducers of type 2 immune response in primary macrophages. Taken together, these results suggest a feedforward mechanism of adrenaline in adipose-resident macrophages, and that myeloid CaMKII signaling plays an important role in catecholamine production and subsequent beige fat activation.© The Author (2017).

The endocannabinoid system is a widespread neuromodulatory system involved in multiple functions including learning and memory processes. Alterations of this system contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in the pathogenesis of Down  has not been explored before. We used the best-characterized preclinical model of Down , the segmentally trisomic Ts65Dn model. In male Ts65Dn mice, cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R) expression was enhanced and its function increased in hippocampal excitatory terminals. Knockdown of CB1R in the hippocampus of male Ts65Dn mice restored hippocampal-dependent memory. Concomitant with this result, pharmacological inhibition of CB1R restored memory deficits, hippocampal synaptic plasticity and adult neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. Notably, the blockade of CB1R also normalized hippocampal-dependent memory in female Ts65Dn mice. To further investigate the mechanisms involved, we used a second transgenic mouse model overexpressing a single gene candidate for Down  cognitive phenotypes, the dual specificity -phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A). CB1R pharmacological blockade similarly improved cognitive performance, synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis in transgenic male Dyrk1A mice. Our results identify CB1R as a novel druggable target potentially relevant for the improvement of cognitive deficits associated with Down .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It remains unclear, however, why visceral adiposity but not subcutaneous adiposity causes insulin resistance and other pathological situations. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) catalyzes hydrolysis of TG in plasma lipoproteins. In the present study, we investigated whether the effects of angiotensin II (AngII) on TG metabolism are mediated through an effect on LPL expression. Adipose tissues were divided into visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) for comparison. AngII accelerated LPL expression in SAT but, on the contrary, suppressed its expression in VAT. In both SAT and VAT, AngII signaled through the same type 1 receptor. In SAT, AngII increased LPL expression via c-Src and p38 MAPK signaling. In VAT, however, AngII reduced LPL expression via the Gq class of G proteins and the subsequent phospholipase C β4 (PLCβ4), protein kinase C β1, nuclear factor κB, and inducible nitric oxide synthase signaling pathways. PLCβ4 small interfering RNA experiments showed that PLCβ4 expression is important for the AngII-induced LPL reduction in VAT, in which PLCβ4 expression increases in the evening and falls at night. Interestingly, PLCβ4 expression in VAT decreased with fasting, while AngII did not decrease LPL expression in VAT in a fasting state. In conclusion, AngII reduces LPL expression through PLCβ4, the expression of which is regulated by feeding in VAT, whereas AngII increases LPL expression in SAT. The different effects of AngII on LPL expression and, hence, TG metabolism in VAT and SAT may partly explain their different contributions to the development of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25450952>A pilot  profiling study in hepatopancreas of Litopenaeus vannamei with white spot  virus based on ¹H NMR spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>White spot  virus, which was a pathogen first found in 1992, had emerged globally affecting shrimp populations in aquaculture.

Through the NOESYPR1D spectrum combined with multi-variate pattern recognition analysis, including principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) models, significantly  changes were observed in WSSV-infected groups compared with the control groups. In the first 48 h, α-glucose and β-glucose were higher in the WSSV-infected group. Meanwhile, acetate, lactate, N-acetyl glycoprotein signals, lysine,  and lipid were significantly decreased in the WSSV-infected group.

IR in adults with obesity and diabetes is associated with changes in amino acid, free fatty acid (FFA), and mitochondrial acylcarnitine (AC) metabolism. We sought to determine whether these metabolites are associated with IR and/or androgens in youth-onset PCOS. We enrolled obese girls with PCOS [ n = 15, 14.5 yr (SD 1.6), %BMI 98.5 (SD 1.0)] and without PCOS [ n = 6, 13.2 yr (SD 1.2), %BMI 98.0 (SD 1.1)]. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Untargeted metabolomics of plasma was performed while fasting and during hyperinsulinemia. Fasting arginine, glutamine, histidine, lysine, phenylalanine, and  were higher ( P < 0.04 for all but P < 0.001 for valine), as were glutamine and histidine during hyperinsulinemia ( P < 0.03). Higher valine during hyperinsulinemia was associated with IR ( r = 0.59, P = 0.006). Surprisingly, end-clamp AC C4 was lower in PCOS, and lower C4 was associated with IR ( r = -0.44, P = 0.04). End-clamp FFAs of C14:0, C16:1, and C18:1 were higher in PCOS girls, and C16:1 and C18:1 strongly associated with IR ( r = 0.73 and 0.53, P < 0.01). Free androgen index related negatively to short-, medium-, and long-chain AC ( r = -0.41 to -0.71, P < 0.01) but not FFA or amino acids. Obese girls with PCOS have a distinct  signature during fasting and hyperinsulinemia.

Recent studies have emphasized the crosstalk between gut and brain, highlighting how gut composition can influence behavior and brain functions. Thus, the present study investigates the relationship between PANS/PANDAS and gut microbiota ecology. The gut composition of a cohort of 30 patients with PANS/PANDAS was analyzed and compared to control subjects using 16S rRNA-based metagenomics. Data were analyzed for their α- and β-diversity; differences in bacterial distribution were detected by Wilcoxon and LEfSe tests, while  profile was predicted via PICRUSt software. These analyses demonstrate the presence of an altered bacterial community structure in PANS/PANDAS patients with respect to controls. In particular, ecological analysis revealed the presence of two main clusters of subjects based on age range. Thus, to avoid age bias, data from patients and controls were split into two groups: 4-8 years old and >9 years old. The younger PANS/PANDAS group was characterized by a strong increase in Bacteroidetes; in particular, , , and  were identified as potential microbial biomarkers of this composition type. Moreover, this group exhibited an increase of several pathways concerning the modulation of the antibody response to inflammation within the gut as well as a decrease in pathways involved in brain function (i.e., SCFA, D-alanine and  metabolism, and the dopamine pathway). The older group of patients displayed a less uniform bacterial profile, thus impairing the identification of distinct biomarkers. Finally, Pearson's analysis between bacteria and anti-streptolysin O titer reveled a negative correlation between genera belonging to Firmicutes phylum and anti-streptolysin O while a positive correlation was observed with . In conclusion, this study suggests that streptococcal infections alter gut bacterial communities leading to a pro-inflammatory status through the selection of specific bacterial strains associated with gut inflammation and immune response activation. These findings highlight the possibility of studying bacterial biomarkers associated with this disorder and might led to novel potential therapeutic strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31212279>Estradiol Protects Neuropeptide Y/Agouti-related Peptide Neurons against Insulin Resistance in Females.</a></h2><p>With obesity men exhibit a higher incidence of  than women in early adult life, but this sex advantage wanes in postmenopausal women. A key diagnostic of the  is insulin resistance in both peripheral tissues and brain, especially in the hypothalamus. Since the anorexigenic hormone 17β-estradiol (E2) regulates food intake in part by inhibiting the excitability of the hypothalamic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP) neurons, we hypothesized that E2 would protect against insulin resistance in NPY/AgRP neurons with diet-induced obesity (DIO). Therefore, we did whole-cell recordings and single cell qPCR in arcuate NPYGFP neurons from both female and male mice to test the efficacy of insulin with DIO. The resting membrane potential and input resistance of NPY/AgRP neurons was significantly increased in DIO versus control-diet fed males. Most notably, the efficacy of insulin to activate KATP channels in NPY/AgRP neurons was significantly attenuated, although the KATP channel opener diazoxide was fully effective in NPY/AgRP neurons from DIO males, indicating that the KATP channels were expressed and functional. In contrast, insulin was fully efficacious to activate KATP channels in DIO females, and the response was reversed by the KATP channel blocker tolbutamide. However, the ability of insulin to activate KATP channels was abrogated with ovariectomy but fully restored with E2 replacement. The insulin resistance in obese males was likely mediated by an increase in suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3), protein  phosphatase B (PTP1B) and T cell protein  phosphatase (TCPTP) activity since the expression of all three mRNAs were upregulated in the obese males but not in females. As proof of principle, pre-incubation of hypothalamic slices from DIO males with the PTP1B/TCPTP inhibitor CX08005 completely rescued the effects of insulin. Therefore, E2 protects NPY/AgRP neurons in females against insulin resistance through, at least in part, attenuating phosphatase activity. The neuroprotective effects of E2 may explain sex differences in the expression of  with aging.© 2019 S.

In spite of the improvements in the early diagnosis of CRC, approximately one-third of patients develop metastasis and then have a very poor survival rate. The mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET) is a  kinase cell surface receptor activated by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Activation of c-MET/HGF signaling pathway regulates a variety of biological processes including cell motility, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and the development and progression of cancer cells. Recent studies have suggested that the c-MET/HGF signaling pathway is involved in the carcinogenesis of CRC. In this review, we summarize the main findings of recent studies investigating the role of c-MET/HGF signaling pathway in CRC and the potential of the c-MET/HGF signaling pathways in the diagnosis and treatment of CRC.© 2019 IUBMB Life, 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27617199>Causality of small and large intestinal microbiota in weight regulation and insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>The twin pandemics of obesity and Type 2 diabetes (T2D) are a global challenge for health care systems. Changes in the environment, behavior, diet, and lifestyle during the last decades are considered the major causes. A Western diet, which is rich in saturated fat and simple sugars, may lead to changes in gut microbial composition and physiology, which have recently been linked to the development of  diseases.We will discuss evidence that demonstrates the influence of the small and large intestinal microbiota on weight regulation and the development of insulin resistance, based on literature search.Altered large intestinal microbial composition may promote obesity by increasing energy harvest through specialized gut microbes. In both large and small intestine, microbial alterations may increase gut permeability that facilitates the translocation of whole bacteria or endotoxic bacterial components into  active tissues. Moreover, changed microbial communities may affect the production of satiety-inducing signals. Finally, bacterial  products, such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and their relative ratios, may be causal in disturbed immune and  signaling, notably in the small intestine where the surface is large. The function of these organs (adipose tissue, brain, liver, muscle, pancreas) may be disturbed by the induction of low-grade inflammation, contributing to insulin resistance.Interventions aimed to restoring gut microbial homeostasis, such as ingestion of specific fibers or therapeutic microbes, are promising strategies to reduce insulin resistance and the related  abnormalities in obesity, , and type 2 diabetes.

However, DEHP exposure effects are not well understood. Changes in industrial and agricultural practices have resulted in increased prevalence of DEHP exposure and has coincided with the heightened occurrence of  and obesity. DEHP and its metabolites are detected in the umbilical cord blood of newborns; however, the prenatal and perinatal effects of DEHP exposure have not been intensively studied. Previously, we discovered that phosphorylation (p) of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) at  114 (Y114) is required for adipogenesis and diet-induced obesity in mice. Here, we show the unique ability of DEHP to induce p-Y114 in PCNA in vitro. We also show that while DEHP promotes adipogenesis of wild type (WT) murine embryonic fibroblasts, mutation of Y114 to phenylalanine (Y114F) in PCNA blocked adipocyte differentiation. Given the induction of p-Y114 in PCNA by DEHP and the relationship to obesity, WT and Y114F PCNA mice were exposed to DEHP during gestation or lactation, followed by high fat diet feeding. Paradoxically, in utero exposure of Y114F PCNA females to DEHP led to a significant increase in body mass and was associated with augmented expression of PPARγ, a critical regulator of obesity, compared to WT controls. In utero exposure of WT mice to DEHP led to insulin sensitivity while Y114F mutation ablated this phenotype, indicating that PCNA is an important regulator of early DEHP exposure and ensuing  phenotypes.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of these alterations in a cohort of CML-chronic phase patients treated with imatinib, dasatinib or nilotinib.The study involved 168 consecutive CML-chronic phase patients with no history of DM/IFG or MS. Anthropometric and  parameters were assessed, and DM/IFG and MS were diagnosed based on the criteria of the American Diabetes Association and the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III, respectively.The nilotinib group had significantly higher levels of fasting plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, insulin resistance, and total and LDL cholesterol than the imatinib and dasatinib groups. DM/IFG were identified in 25% of the imatinib- and dasatinib-treated patients, and 33% of those in the nilotinib cohort (p = 0.39 vs imatinib and p = 0.69 vs dasatinib). A diagnosis of MS was made in 42.4% of the imatinib-treated patients, 37.5% of the dasatinib-treated patients, and 36.1% of the nilotinib-treated patients (p = 0.46 vs imatinib and p = 0.34 vs dasatinib).Treatment with nilotinib does not seem to induce DM/IFG or the MS to a significantly higher extent than imatinib or dasatinib, though it causes a worse glycometabolic profile.

Meanwhile, the main constituents of NPC in rat serum were also detected to analyze its correlation between the constituents in vivo and the biomarkers of KYDS, and determine the potential effective compounds for therapeutic effect. Eleven biomarkers of KYDS were identified in the rat models, involving steroid hormone biosynthesis, tryptophan metabolism and  metabolism. It was found that NPC could regulate steroid hormone biosynthesis, tryptophan metabolism and  metabolism; PCMS analysis showed that caffeic acid, 2-hydroxy-1-methoxy-anthraquinone, 1-hydroxy-2-methoxyanthraquinone, ferulic acid glucuronide conjugation, deacetylasperulosidic acid, cynaroside, betaine and umbelliferone were the main effective compounds of NPC for KYDS.

There are significant changes in plasma amino acid levels (valine, , and proline) and their intermediates (2-hydroxybutyrate, 4-aminobutyrate, and taurine), whereas in kidneys, the TCA cycle metabolism (citrate, fumarate, and succinate) and the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway products (inosine and uracil) are significantly altered (p < 0.05) from 8 to 16 weeks of age.

In the current study, the analysis was broadened ten-fold using a modified aptamer (SOMAmer) library, enabling an unbiased search for new proteins correlated with water T and thus,  health.Water T measurements were recorded using fasting plasma and serum from non-diabetic human subjects. In parallel, plasma samples were analyzed using a SOMAscan assay that employed modified DNA aptamers to determine the relative concentrations of 1310 proteins. A multi-step statistical analysis was performed to identify the biomarkers most predictive of water T. The steps included Spearman rank correlation, followed by principal components analysis with variable clustering, random forests for biomarker selection, and regression trees for biomarker ranking.The multi-step analysis unveiled five new proteins most predictive of water T: hepatocyte growth factor, receptor  kinase FLT3, bone sialoprotein 2, glucokinase regulatory protein and endothelial cell-specific molecule 1. Three of the five strongest predictors of water T have been previously implicated in cardiometabolic diseases.

EGCG also alleviates insulin resistance by enhancing  phosphorylated levels of IRS-1, stimulating the translocation of GLUT2, and activating PI3K/AKT as well as AMPK signaling pathways in a Bmal1-dependent manner both in HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes. Glucosamine-stimulated excessive secretions of ROS and depletions of mitochondrial membrane potential were notably attenuated in EGCG co-treated HepG2 cells, which consistent with the recovery in expression of mitochondrial respiration complexes.The results demonstrated that EGCG possesses a Bmal1-dependent efficacy against insulin resistance conditions by strengthening the insulin signaling and eliminating oxidative stress, suggesting that EGCG may serve as a promising natural nutraceutical for the regulation of  disorders relevant to circadian clocks.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This study aims to examine the effects of gallocatechin -(4→8)-gallocatechin-3-O-gallate (GC-(4→8)-GCG), a main proanthocyanidin dimer from Camellia ptilophylla (Cocoa tea), on adipocyte- and adipose-related inflammation in vivo and in vitro.C57BL/6 mice are fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and GC-(4→8)-GCG (40 or 80 mg kg d ) for 8 weeks. The  profiles, adipose tissue hypertrophy, macrophage infiltration, and inflammatory cytokine production are investigated. Additionally, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes are utilized to investigate the effect of GC-(4→8)-GCG on preadipocyte differentiation and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-stimulated inflammatory response in vitro. GC-(4→8)-GCG supplementation decreases HFD-induced epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) hypertrophy, suppresses proinflammatory cytokine production and macrophage infiltration in eWAT, and improves insulin sensitivity in HFD-induced obese mice. In vitro, GC-(4→8)-GCG shows a strong anti-adipogenic potential in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte by inhibiting the expression of key adipogenic transcription factors and decreasing the production of proinflammatory cytokines by inhibiting the activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB, Janus  kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT3) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.GC-(4→8)-GCG can modulate obesity and improve obesity-related insulin resistance by inhibiting preadipocyte differentiation and the related proinflammatory responses.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Antiangiogenic therapy had shown a certain effect in advanced SCLC. Apatinib, a new potent oral small-molecule  kinase inhibitor targeting the intracellular domain of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), showed the effect of anti-angiogenesis. However, the efficacy in SCLC was rarely reported. We reported 1 case of advanced SCLC with Gilbert , the patient received Apatinib after the failure of 4 lines of chemotherapy, and achieved a partial response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 standard after one month. The progression-free survival (PFS) was 5 months. Apatinib was well tolerated except recurrent grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia because of the  disorder of Bilirubin. Salvage treatment with Apatinib for advanced SCLC deserved further exploration. .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27322467>Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-1 Protects Against Hepatic Insulin Resistance and Hepatic Steatosis.</a></h2><p>Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) is a multifunctional uptake receptor for chylomicron remnants in the liver. In vascular smooth muscle cells LRP1 controls reverse cholesterol transport through platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFR-β) trafficking and  kinase activity. Here we show that LRP1 regulates hepatic energy homeostasis by integrating insulin signaling with lipid uptake and secretion. Somatic inactivation of LRP1 in the liver (hLRP1KO) predisposes to diet-induced insulin resistance with dyslipidemia and non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis. On a high-fat diet, hLRP1KO mice develop a severe  secondary to hepatic insulin resistance, reduced expression of insulin receptors on the hepatocyte surface and decreased glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) translocation. While LRP1 is also required for efficient cell surface insulin receptor expression in the absence of exogenous lipids, this latent state of insulin resistance is unmasked by exposure to fatty acids. This further impairs insulin receptor trafficking and results in increased hepatic lipogenesis, impaired fatty acid oxidation and reduced very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride secretion.Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

Various toxic effects of LPS have been extensively reported, mainly on the toxicity of LPS in cellular level, macrophages or tumor cells, etc. This work aimed on the impact of LPS on mast cell metabolism, which focused on LPS-induced cellular  profiles. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) based metabolomics strategy was implemented for the endo-metabolites detection in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, treated with 10 μg/mL LPS for 24 h, along with multiple time-dose tests of cells viability/apoptosis. Significantly changes metabolites were mainly involved the metabolism of glycine, serine, threonine and the biosynthesis of phenylalanine, , tryptophan and pentose phosphate pathway. The endo-metabolism results illustrated that LPS treatment led to downregulation of glycine, serine and threonine metabolism besides pentose phosphate pathway in RBL-2H3 cells. This novel insight into LPS cellular metabolism, provides some heuristic guidance for elucidating the underlying mechanism of LPS-mediated disease.Copyright © 2017.

However, how ILC2 in adipose tissue is regulated remains largely unknown. Here, our study shows that ILC2s are present in brown adipose tissue (BAT) as well as subcutaneous and epididymal WAT (sWAT and eWAT). The fractions of ILC2s, natural killer T (NKT) cells and eosinophils in sWAT, eWAT and BAT are significantly decreased by high-fat-diet (HFD) feeding and leptin deficiency-induced obesity. Consistent with this, the adipose expression and circulating levels of IL-33, a key inducing cytokine of ILC2, are significantly downregulated by obesity. Furthermore, administration of IL-33 markedly increases the fraction of ILC2 and eosinophil as well as the expression of UCP1 and  hydroxylase (TH), a rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis, in adipose tissue of HFD-fed mice. On the other hand, cold exposure induces the expression levels of IL-33 and UCP1 and the population of ILC2 and eosinophil in sWAT, and these promoting effects of cold stress are reversed by neutralization of IL-33 signaling in vivo Moreover, the basal and cold-induced IL-33 and ILC2/eosinophil pathways are significantly suppressed by sympathetic denervation via local injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in sWAT. Taken together, our data suggest that the ILC2/eosinophil axis in adipose tissue is regulated by sympathetic nervous system and obesity in IL-33-dependent manner, and IL-33-driven ILC2/eosinophil axis is implicated in the development of obesity.© 2016 Society for Endocrinology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26322160>Magnesium and type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes is frequently associated with both extracellular and intracellular magnesium (Mg) deficits. A chronic latent Mg deficit or an overt clinical hypomagnesemia is common in patients with type 2 diabetes, especially in those with poorly controlled glycemic profiles. Insulin and glucose are important regulators of Mg metabolism. Intracellular Mg plays a key role in regulating insulin action, insulin-mediated-glucose-uptake and vascular tone. Reduced intracellular Mg concentrations result in a defective -kinase activity, postreceptorial impairment in insulin action and worsening of insulin resistance in diabetic patients. A low Mg intake and an increased Mg urinary loss appear the most important mechanisms that may favor Mg depletion in patients with type 2 diabetes. Low dietary Mg intake has been related to the development of type 2 diabetes and . Benefits of Mg supplementation on  profiles in diabetic patients have been found in most, but not all clinical studies and larger prospective studies are needed to support the potential role of dietary Mg supplementation as a possible public health strategy in diabetes risk. The aim of this review is to revise current evidence on the mechanisms of Mg deficiency in diabetes and on the possible role of Mg supplementation in the prevention and management of the disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26785698>Phenotypic characterization of nanshi oral liquid alters  signatures during disease prevention.</a></h2><p>This paper was designed to investigate the phenotypic characterization of Nanshi Oral Liquid (NOL) alters  signatures of the 'Kidney Yang Deficiency ' (KYDS). Urine metabolites were profiled by UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-HDMS. The significantly changed metabolites such as xanthurenic acid, 4,8-dihydroxyquinoline, 3-methyldioxyindole, 4,6-dihydroxyquinoline, kynurenic acid, hippuric acid, taurine, tyramine, and 3-metanephrine, had been identified, and were related to the disturbance in  metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism and lysine degradation, which were helpful to further understanding the KYDS and intervention mechanism of NOL. The biochemical result showed that NOL can alleviate the kidney impairment induced by KYDS. Metabolomics results indicated the significantly changed metabolites were found to be reasonable in explaining the action mechanism of NOL. Interestingly, the effectiveness of NOL against KYDS was proved using the established metabolomics method and regulated the biomarkers as well as adjusted the  disorder pathways. NOL had potentially pharmacological effect through regulating multiple perturbed pathways to normal state. This work showed that the metabolomics method was a powerful approach for studying the phenotypic characterization of disease's  during disease prevention and its intervention mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27052924>Impaired stimulation of glucose transport in cardiac myocytes exposed to very low-density lipoproteins.</a></h2><p>We recently observed that free fatty acids impair the stimulation of glucose transport into cardiomyocytes in response to either insulin or  stress. In vivo, fatty acids for the myocardium are mostly obtained from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons and Very Low-Density Lipoproteins). We therefore determined whether exposure of cardiac myocytes to VLDL resulted in impaired basal and stimulated glucose transport. Primary adult rat cardiac myocytes were chronically exposed to VLDL before glucose uptake was measured in response to insulin or  stress, provoked by the mitochondrial ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin. Exposure of cardiac myocytes to VLDL reduced both insulin-and oligomycin-stimulated glucose uptake. The reduction of glucose uptake was associated with a moderately reduced  phosphorylation of the insulin receptor. No reduction of the phosphorylation of the downstream effectors of insulin signaling Akt and AS160 was however observed. Similarly only a modest reduction of the activating phosphorylation of the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) was observed in response to oligomycin. Similar to our previous observations with free fatty acids, inhibition of fatty acid oxidation restored oligomycin-stimulated glucose uptake. In conclusions, VLDL-derived fatty acids impair stimulated glucose transport in cardiac myocytes by a mechanism that seems to be mediated by a fatty acid oxidation intermediate. Thus, in the clinical context of the  high VLDL may contribute to enhancement of ischemic injury by reduction of  stress-stimulated glucose uptake.Copyright © 2016 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

The core objective in most optimal drug designs is positive therapeutic effects. In this study, we considered the effects of therapeutic, adverse, and target variation simultaneously. A fuzzy optimization method was applied to formulate a multiobjective drug design problem for detecting enzyme targets in the presynaptic dopamine  network to remedy two types of enzymopathies caused by deficiencies of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) and  hydroxylase (TH). The fuzzy membership approach transforms a two-stage drug discovery problem into a unified decision-making problem. We developed a nested hybrid differential evolution algorithm to efficiently identify a set of potential drug targets. Furthermore, we also simulated the effects of current clinical drugs for Parkinson's disease (PD) in this model and tried to clarify the possible causes of neurotoxic and neuroprotective effects. The optimal drug design could yield 100% satisfaction grade when both therapeutic effect and the number of targets were considered in the objective. This scenario required regulating one to three and one or two enzyme targets for 50%-95% and 50%-100% VMAT2 and TH deficiencies, respectively. However, their corresponding adverse and target variation effect grades were less satisfactory. For the most severe deficiencies of VMAT2 and TH, a compromise design could be obtained when the effects of therapeutic, adverse, and target variation were simultaneously applied to the optimal drug discovery problem. Such a trade-off design followed the no free lunch theorem for optimization; that is, a more serious dopamine deficiency required more enzyme targets and lower satisfaction grade. In addition, the therapeutic effects of current clinical medications for PD could be enhanced in combination with new enzyme targets. The increase of toxic metabolites after treatment might be the cause of neurotoxic effects of some current PD medications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29659837>Noonan -causing SHP2 mutants impair ERK-dependent chondrocyte differentiation during endochondral bone growth.</a></h2><p>Growth retardation is a constant feature of Noonan  (NS) but its physiopathology remains poorly understood. We previously reported that hyperactive NS-causing SHP2 mutants impair the systemic production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) through hyperactivation of the RAS/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) signalling pathway. Besides endocrine defects, a direct effect of these mutants on growth plate has not been explored, although recent studies have revealed an important physiological role for SHP2 in endochondral bone growth. We demonstrated that growth plate length was reduced in NS mice, mostly due to a shortening of the hypertrophic zone and to a lesser extent of the proliferating zone. These histological features were correlated with decreased expression of early chondrocyte differentiation markers, and with reduced alkaline phosphatase staining and activity, in NS murine primary chondrocytes. Although IGF1 treatment improved growth of NS mice, it did not fully reverse growth plate abnormalities, notably the decreased hypertrophic zone. In contrast, we documented a role of RAS/ERK hyperactivation at the growth plate level since 1) NS-causing SHP2 mutants enhance RAS/ERK activation in chondrocytes in vivo (NS mice) and in vitro (ATDC5 cells) and 2) inhibition of RAS/ERK hyperactivation by U0126 treatment alleviated growth plate abnormalities and enhanced chondrocyte differentiation. Similar effects were obtained by chronic treatment of NS mice with statins. In conclusion, we demonstrated that hyperactive NS-causing SHP2 mutants impair chondrocyte differentiation during endochondral bone growth through a local hyperactivation of the RAS/ERK signalling pathway, and that statin treatment may be a possible therapeutic approach in NS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29363790>Linoleic acid induces an increased response to insulin in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological studies and animal models suggest a link between high levels of dietary fat intake and an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Hyperinsulinemia is a feature of obesity, diabetes, and  that is associated with an increased breast cancer risk. Insulin is a hormone involved in  regulation of carbohydrate. However, it is also a growth factor that mediates proliferation and migration. Linoleic acid (LA) is a fatty acid that induces migration and invasion in breast cancer cells. In the present study, we demonstrate, for the first time, that treatment with LA increases IR and IGF1R expression through a Free Fatty Acid Receptor 4 (FFAR4)-, lipooxygenases (LOXs)-, and SRC-dependent pathway in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, and similarly induces an increase of IR expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. In addition, insulin induces  phosphorylation of IR/IGF1R and migration in MDA-MB-231 cells pretreated with LA, whereas it augments the increase in migration in MCF-7 cells pretreated with LA. Pretreatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with LA induces invasion, proliferation, and increase the MMP-9 secretion induced by insulin. In summary, our findings demonstrate that treatment with LA induces a higher response to insulin in breast cancer cells.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p></html>
