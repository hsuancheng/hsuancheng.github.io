We measured changes in the proteome associated with bacterially induced intestinal inflammation in the interleukin 10 gene-deficient (Il10(-/-)) mouse model of IBD, established effects of the dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) n-3 eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and n-6 arachidonic  (AA) on protein expression (using  as a control fatty ), and compared these changes with previously observed transcriptome changes in the same model. Ingenuity pathways analysis of proteomics data showed bacterially induced inflammation was associated with reduced expression of proteins from pathways of metabolism and digestion/absorption/excretion of nutrients/ions, and increased expression of cellular stress and immune response proteins. Both PUFA treatments showed anti- activity; EPA appeared to act via the PPARα pathway, whereas AA appeared to increase energy metabolism and cytoskeletal organization and reduce cellular stress responses, possibly enabling a more robust response to inflammation. While there was agreement between proteomic and transcriptomic data with respect to pathways, there was limited concordance between individual gene and protein data, reflecting the importance of having both gene and protein data to better understand complex  such as IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6524906>In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of a Mycobacterium sp. isolated from patients with Crohn's .</a></h2><p>The in vitro susceptibility of three strains of an unclassified Mycobacterium sp., isolated from three patients with Crohn's , to 23 antimicrobial agents was determined by a modified broth dilution method with 7H9 broth containing -albumin-dextrose-catalase, Tween 80, and mycobactin J.

It is converted to the cis-9, trans-11 isomer of conjugated linoleic  (c9, t11-CLA) by the action of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) in tissue. c9, t11-CLA has been associated with anti- effects and also affects lipid metabolism. The aim of the present study was to determine if TVA is bioconverted to c9, t11-CLA in intestinal epithelial cells and to ascertain whether TVA has effects similar to c9, t11-CLA on markers of inflammation relevant to . The present study demonstrated that TVA treatment led to significant bioconversion into c9, t11-CLA in Caco-2 cells. Treatment with both TVA and c9, t11-CLA resulted in alteration of cellular fatty  profile and SCD activity in the Caco-2 cell line. However, CLA, but not TVA, significantly modulated transcription of TNF-alpha, IL-12, IL-6 and production of IL-12 by these cells. Thus the present study established that TVA treatment can alter SCD desaturation indices and induce compositional changes in the fatty  profile of the Caco-2 cell model of the human intestinal epithelium but this is not associated with functional effects on markers of the  response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12117873>Fat composition may be a clue to explain the primary therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in Crohn's : results of a double blind randomised multicentre European trial.</a></h2><p>Dietary fat has been suggested to determine the therapeutic effect of enteral diets in Crohn's .To assess the efficacy of two whole protein based diets with different fat compositions (n6 polyunsaturated fatty acids v monounsaturated fatty acids) in inducing clinical remission in active Crohn's  compared with steroids.Sixty two patients with active Crohn's  were randomised to receive, for not more than 4 weeks: (a) a polymeric enteral diet containing 35 g of lipids per 1000 kcal, high in oleate (79%) and low in linoleate (6.5%) (PEN1), (b) an identical enteral diet except for the type of fat which was high in linoleate (45%) and low in oleate (28%) (PEN2), or (c) oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day). Diets were double blindly administered. The steroid group received a conventional ward diet. Treatment failure was considered when remission was not achieved at week 4. Clinical activity and biological and nutritional parameters were monitored. Independent predictors of remission were identified by stepwise logistic regression analysis.Overall remission rates (by intention to treat) were 20% (4/20) for PEN1, 52% (12/23) for PEN2, and 79% (15/19) for steroids (overall p=0.001; p<0.0005 steroids v PEN1, and p=0.056 PEN2 v PEN1). After excluding those patients who were non-compliant during the first week (per protocol analysis), remission rates were 27%, 63%, and 79%, respectively (p=0.008, steroids and PEN2 v PEN1).

In this study, the efficacy of celastrol against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in mice was established and the mechanism was investigated using lipidomics. Celastrol treatment significantly alleviated DSS-induced  in mice, as revealed by the body weight, colon length, scores of rectal bleeding and diarrhea, serum TNF-α level, and histological analysis results. Lipidomics analysis based on UPLC/MS revealed characteristic changes in the metabolic profiles of the  mice, with altered levels of lipid markers associated with IBD, including LPC18 : 0, LPC18 : 1, LPC18 : 2, sphingomyelin (SM), and increased LPC18 : 0/LPC18 : 1 and LPC18 : 0/LPC18 : 2 ratios. For the celastrol-treated  mice, however, levels of the above lipid markers were restored, together with recovered saturated LPC/unsaturated LPC ratios. Accordingly, using GC-MS analysis, increased stearic  (C18 : 0)/ (C18 : 1) and stearic  (C18 : 0)/linoleic  (C18 : 2) ratios were observed in  mice, which were later recovered after celastrol treatment. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that the liver expression of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1), the key enzyme controlling the desaturation of saturated fatty , was dramatically inhibited in IBD mice, and was obviously recovered after celastrol treatment. These results suggest that the increased saturated LPC/unsaturated LPC (and saturated fatty /unsaturated fatty ) ratios associated with SCD1 down-regulation could be regarded as biomarkers of , and celastrol alleviates DSS-induced  partially via up-regulation of SCD1, restoring the altered balance between stearic - and -derived lipid species, which plays an important role in alleviating .

Although recent studies have shown that TFAs promote intestinal inflammation, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of dietary fat containing TFAs on dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced . C57 BL/6 mice were fed a diet containing 1·3% TFAs (mainly C16:1, C18:1, C18:2, C20:1, C20:2 and C22:1), and then  was induced with 1·5% DSS. Colonic damage was assessed, and the mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines and major regulators of T cell differentiation were measured. The TFA diet reduced survival and exacerbated histological damage in mice administered DSS compared with those fed a TFA-free diet. The TFA diet significantly elevated interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12p40, IL-23p19 and retinoic -related orphan receptor (ROR)γt mRNA levels in the colons of DSS-treated animals. Moreover, IL-17A mRNA levels were elevated significantly by the TFA diet, with or without DSS treatment. We also examined the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages. These cells were exposed to TFAs (linoelaidic  or elaidic ) with or without LPS and the mRNA levels of various cytokines were measured. IL-23p19 mRNA levels were increased significantly by TFAs in the absence of LPS. Cytokine expression was also higher in LPS-stimulated cells exposed to TFAs than in unexposed LPS-stimulated cells. Collectively, our results suggest that TFAs exacerbate colonic inflammation by promoting Th17 polarization and by up-regulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the inflamed colonic mucosa.© 2013 British Society for Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2852876>[Fat absorption in patients with   of the large intestine and diffuse polyposis].</a></h2><p>Radioisotope method with oral administration of 131I-trioleate glycerin and 131I- was used to study the absorption of neutral fats and fatty acids in 123 patients with ulcerative colitis, diffuse polyposis of the large intestine, and in 7 patients with ileostomy.

Eight subjects with chronic ulcerative colitis who had undergone the operation were studied on 2 consecutive days. On 1 day, saline (154 mM NaCl) was infused into the ileal pouch, and on the other day emulsified  (152 mM) was infused. The subjects ate a 300-kcal mixed meal containing liquid labelled with 99mTc-DTPA. To assess small- transit concurrently with gastric emptying, a second marker, 111In-DTPA, was instilled through a tube into the duodenum at the end of the meal. Transit of both markers was monitored scintigraphically. Infusion of  into the ileal pouch slowed gastric emptying and small- transit, and delayed the time to defecation compared with saline infusion. Neither the ileal pouch infusion alone or the meal alone altered plasma levels of enteroglucagon, neurotensin, or peptide YY, but the combination of the  infusion and the meal increased the levels of all 3 hormones. It was concluded that an "ileal brake" on gastrointestinal transit is functional following ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.  placed into the ileal pouch slowed gastrointestinal transit and delayed defecation, effects which may have clinical application.

Systemic turnover and regional exchange of free fatty  were evaluated using intravenous infusion of 14C-labelled . All measurements were made in the postabsorptive, overnight fasted state. Arterial glucose concentrations were 10% lower in the patients but net splanchnic glucose output was similar in patients and controls.

Dysfunction of tight junction (TJ) in the intestine contributes to the pathogenesis of many disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. We evaluated the effects of five novel gut microbial metabolites on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced barrier impairment in Caco-2 cells and dextran sulfate sodium-induced  in mice. 10-Hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic  (HYA), a gut microbial metabolite of linoleic , suppressed TNF-α and dextran sulfate sodium-induced changes in the expression of TJ-related molecules, occludin, zonula occludens-1, and myosin light chain kinase. HYA also suppressed the expression of TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) mRNA and protein expression in Caco-2 cells and colonic tissue. In addition, HYA suppressed the protein expression of TNFR2 in murine intestinal epithelial cells. Furthermore, HYA significantly up-regulated G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 40 expression in Caco-2 cells. It also induced [Ca(2+)]i responses in HEK293 cells expressing human GPR40 with higher sensitivity than linoleic , its metabolic precursor.

This study aimed to prospectively investigate whether AA is positively and OA is negatively associated with incident UC development, using data from 7-day food diaries.A total of 25 639 men and women, aged between 40 and 79 years, from Norfolk, UK, were recruited into the prospective European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk cohort between 1993 and 1997. At baseline, participants completed 7-day food diaries, checked by nutritionists using a database containing 11 000 foods and 55 000 portion sizes. The cohort was monitored until June 2004 to identify participants who developed UC. Each patient was matched for age and sex with four controls, and conditional logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios for AA and OA intakes, and UC association.Of the participants, 26 (58% men) developed incident UC (53% left sided) after a median follow-up time of 3.8 years (0.5-8.3 years). The highest AA tertile was positively associated with an odds ratio of 6.09 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-35.23], with a trend across tertiles [odds ratio (OR) 2.43, 95% CI 1.06-5.61, P=0.04].

The concentrations of IL-8 were measured in the media and cellular oxidative stress was quantitated by measurement of thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARSs).Spontaneous production of IL-8 was significantly higher in HISM cells isolated from Crohn's  compared to control . LA caused a marked, nine-fold, increase in IL-8 secretion by Crohn's cells, an effect that could be simulated in normal HISM cells by co-incubation of LA with an oxidizing solution (Ox) composed of hypoxanthine+xanthine oxidase+FeSO(4) (OxLA). These effects were inhibited by vitamins C and E. Treatment of Crohn's cells with OxLA did not further increase IL-8 over that of LA alone. The effect of LA alone was not associated with an increase in cellular oxidative stress as quantitated by TBARSs. In contrast to the results with LA, treatment with OA or OxOA did not increase IL-8 in either normal or Crohn's cells. In addition, OA protected Crohn's cells from the increase in TBARSs induced by Ox. In contrast to IL-8, spontaneous production of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1) was significantly lower in Crohn's HISM cells as compared to normal cells and exposure to OxLA did not increase its production.LA, but not OA, increased the production of IL-8 by HISM cells.

Mice in normal control group and DSS group were orally given the same volume of distilled water and soybean lecithin suspension (0.15g/kg) respectively. The effects of BJOE on DSS-induced UC were assessed by determination of body weight loss, disease activity index (DAI), colon length, histological analysis, as well as levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The mRNA expression of MPO, iNOS and COX-2 in colon tissues was detected by qRT-PCR. In addition, NF-κB p65, p-p65 and IκB-α, p-IκBα protein expression levels in colon tissues were investigated using Western blotting.The major components of BJOE were found to be  (62.68%) and linoleic  (19.53%) as detected by GC-MS. Our results indicated that BJOE, SASP and AZA showed beneficial effect on DSS-induced  in mice, and significantly reduced the body weight loss and DAI, restored the colon length, repaired colonic pathological variations, decreased histological scores, and decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 and IFN-γ) as compared with the DSS group. In addition, the mRNA expression of MPO, iNOS and COX-2 induced by DSS treatment was remarkably inhibited by BJOE, SASP or AZA treatments. Furthermore, when compared with DSS-treated mice, the activation of NF-κB was significantly inhibited by AZA and BJOE treatment.Our study shows that BJOE possessed appreciable anti-inflammatory effect against murine experimental UC induced by DSS. The protective mechanism of BJOE may involve inhibition of NF-κB signal transduction pathways and subsequent down-regulation of inflammatory mediators. These findings suggest that BJOE might be an efficacious and promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of UC. Our investigation might also provide experimental evidence for the traditional application of Brucea javanica in the treatment of dysentery and might add new dimension to the clinical indications for BJOE.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Colonic mucosa from 19 patients with ulcerative colitis, eight with Crohn's  and 14 controls were analysed for arachidonic  (C20:4), linoleic  (C18:2),  (C18:1), stearic  (C18:0) and palmitic  (C16:0). 2. Gas-liquid chromatography of lipid extracts showed that arachidonic  was significantly higher in ulcerative colitis (19 +/- 4) and Crohn's  (20 +/- 3) than in controls (13 +/- 5 micrograms/mg of protein) (means +/- SD). Neither the degree of inflammation nor treatment with sulphasalazine or prednisolone appeared to influence the fatty  concentrations. 3. Seventy-five to ninety-five per cent of the arachidonic  was found in the phospholipid fraction after separation by thin-layer chromatography. There were no significant changes in the concentrations of the other fatty acids measured, although  was lower in . The ratios of  to stearic  and to palmitic  were lower in . 4.

Moreover,  patients have elevated colonic arachidonic  (AA) proportions. So far, effects of dietary AA v. FO on colitis have never been examined. We therefore designed three isoenergetic diets, which were fed to mice for 6 weeks preceding and during 7 d dextran sodium sulfate colitis induction. The control diet was rich in  (OA). For the other two diets, 1.0 % (w/w) OA was exchanged for EPA+DHA (FO group) or AA. At 7 d after colitis induction, the AA group had gained weight (0.46 (sem 0.54) g), whereas the FO and OA groups had lost weight (- 0.98 (SEM 0.81) g and - 0.79 (SEM 1.05) g, respectively; P < 0.01 v. AA). The AA group had less diarrhoea than the FO and OA groups (P < 0.05). Weight and length of the colon, histological scores and cytokine concentrations in colon homogenates showed no differences. Myeloperoxidase concentrations in plasma and polymorphonuclear cell infiltration in colon were decreased in the FO group as compared with the OA group. We conclude that in this mice model an AA-enriched diet increased colonic AA content, but did not result in more colonic inflammation as compared with FO- and OA-enriched diets. As we only examined effects after 7 d and because the time point for evaluating effects seems to be important, the present results should be regarded as preliminary. Future studies should further elucidate differential effects of fatty acids on colitis development in time.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19285259>Role of acylethanolamides in the gastrointestinal tract with special reference to food intake and energy balance.</a></h2><p>Acylethanolamides (AEs) are a group of lipids occurring in both plants and animals. The best-studied AEs are the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA), the anti- compound palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), and the potent anorexigenic molecule oleoylethanolamide (OEA). AEs are biosynthesized in the gastrointestinal tract, and their levels may change in response to noxious stimuli, food deprivation or diet-induced obesity. The biological actions of AEs within the gut are not limited to the modulation of food intake and energy balance. For example, AEs exert potential beneficial effects in the regulation of intestinal motility, secretion, inflammation and cellular proliferation. Molecular targets of AEs, which have been identified in the gastrointestinal tract, include cannabinoid CB(1) and CB(2) receptors (activated by AEA), transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1, activated by AEA and OEA), the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha, activated by OEA and, to a less extent, by PEA), and the orphan G-coupled receptors GPR119 (activated by OEA) and GPR55 (activated by PEA and, with lower potency, by AEA and OEA). Modulation of AE levels in the gut may provide new pharmacological strategies not only for the treatment of feeding disorders but also for the prevention or cure of widespread intestinal  such as  and colon cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28719542>Cideb Deficiency Aggravates Dextran Sulfate Sodium-induced Ulcerative  in Mice by Exacerbating the Oxidative Burden in Colonic Mucosa.</a></h2><p>Abnormal lipid metabolism is one of many factors that contribute to the development of ulcerative  (UC). As a lipid droplet-associated protein, Cideb facilitated the export of lipids from enterocytes and promoted intestinal lipid absorption. We found that Cideb was upregulated in the colonic mucosa of both UC patients and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced mouse , but its roles in the pathogenesis of UC are still ill-defined.Acute  was induced with DSS in Cideb-null and wild-type mice, and the inflammation and oxidative stress were evaluated in the colonic mucosa. Moreover, triglyceride accumulation and oxidative stress were further analyzed in polarized Caco-2 cells with overexpression of Cideb.Our present data indicated that Cideb-null mice were more susceptible to DSS-induced , and consumption of a high-fat diet exacerbated the deterioration of DSS-induced  in Cideb-null mice. Moreover, Cideb deficiency increased the colonic oxidative stress in DSS-treated mice and more significant under a high-fat diet condition. In exploring the mechanism, we found that Cideb deficiency elevated the lipid content in both feces and the colonic mucosa of DSS-treated mice, especially those fed with a high-fat diet. The in vitro evidence proved that Cideb expression reduced triglyceride accumulation and oxidative stress in polarized Caco-2 cells in the presence of .Our data suggest that Cideb plays a protective role against the development of UC by reducing the lipid accumulation and oxidative damage in the colonic mucosa.

Many of these benefits are, in addition to its high proportion of , due to the high content of phenolic compounds.Six-week-old mice were randomized into three dietary groups: standard, EVOO and hydroxytyrosol-enriched EVOO. After 30 days, mice that were exposed to 3% DSS for 5 days developed acute colitis that progressed to severe chronic inflammation during a regime of 21 days of water.Diets enriched with EVOO significantly attenuated the clinical and histological signs of damage, improving results from  activity index and reducing about 50% the mortality caused by DSS. Moreover, hydroxytyrosol supplement showed better results. Cytokines study showed that TNF-α was maintained near to sham control and IL-10 levels were significantly improved in EVOO and EVOO plus hydroxytyrosol diet-DSS groups. In the same way, COX-2 and iNOS were downregulated, and the activation of p38 MAPK was reduced. We also observed a higher significant reduction in iNOS in hydroxytyrosol-enriched EVOO compared with EVOO alone.EVOO diets exerted a noteworthy beneficial effect in chronic DSS-induced colitis by cytokine modulation and COX-2 and iNOS reduction via downregulation of p38 MAPK. In addition to the beneficial effect by EVOO, supplementation of the diet with hydroxytyrosol may improve chronic colitis through iNOS downregulation plus its antioxidant capacity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20440721>Dietary arachidonic -mediated effects on colon inflammation using transcriptome analysis.</a></h2><p>Increased levels of n-6 arachidonic  (AA), a precursor of pro- eicosanoids, have been found in the colon mucosa of  patients when compared with healthy subjects. The hypothesis was that dietary AA would aggravate colon inflammation by changing expression of genes in  signaling pathways. AA-enriched diet was fed to IL10 gene-deficient (Il10-/-) mice, model of a , and compared with Il10-/- mice fed an  control diet. Effects of AA on gene expression profiles during colitis were examined using whole genome microarray analysis. Dietary AA decreased the expression levels of some colonic genes in ER stress, complement system, nuclear respiratory factor 2-mediated oxidative stress and positive acute phase response pathways compared with Il10-/- mice fed an  diet. AA increased the expression levels of fatty  catabolism genes, but decreased that of lipid synthesis genes during colitis, likely by sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 and target gene regulation. A link has been suggested between AA and reduction of intestinal fibrosis by down-regulating the expression levels of pro- and fibrotic marker genes. Contrary to the hypothesis, these findings suggest that dietary AA, in the present experimental conditions, is not pro-, reduces ER stress and protects colonocytes from oxidative stress in Il10-/- mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1955170>Incorporation of fatty acids from fish oil and olive oil into colonic mucosal lipids and effects upon eicosanoid synthesis in .</a></h2><p>The incorporation of the fatty acids in fish and olive oil into the colonic mucosa of patients with  was examined during 12 weeks' dietary supplementation with the oils, and the influence on colonic mucosal prostaglandin and thromboxane generation was measured. With a dietary supplement of 18 g fish oil daily, concentrations of the major polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish oil, eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic , were significantly raised in mucosal lipids. The first time these were measured, after three weeks' supplementation, the mean increases in eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic  were seven fold and 1.5 fold respectively, and these increases were maintained during the 12 week study. Arachidonic  values fell throughout the study and this reduction was significant at 12 weeks. Mucosal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), thromboxane B2, and 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha synthesis were suppressed, and this reached significance (p less than 0.05) at three and 12 weeks for PGE2 and at 12 weeks for thromboxane B2.

In ulcerative colitis patients, total cholesterol and docosahexaenoic  were lower than in healthy subjects (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05). The median interval between colectomy and ileostomy closure was 6 (range 2-9) months. During that interval, the  parameters improved, high-density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol increased (p < 0.01), and low-density (LDL) cholesterol decreased (p = 0.01). At ileostomy closure, serum arachidonic  levels were increased (p = 0.04), whereas serum  level was decreased (p = 0.02). In this interval, no significant alteration, either in serum n-3 FA precursors or in the FA of subcutaneous adipose tissue, was observed. The increase of serum arachidonic  after colectomy might suggest a lower utilization for  process. The reduction of LDL cholesterol is an index of malabsorption probably due to the accelerated transit and to the exclusion of the terminal ileum caused by the covering ileostomy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19932165>Nitrated  up-regulates PPARgamma and attenuates experimental .</a></h2><p>Nitric oxide and its metabolites undergo nitration reactions with unsaturated fatty acids during oxidative  conditions, forming electrophilic nitro-fatty  derivatives.

OA-NO(2) reduced the  activity index and completely prevented dextran sulfate sodium-induced colon shortening and the increase in colonic p65 expression. Increased PPARgamma expression was observed in colon samples as well as in cells after OA-NO(2) administration, whereas no effect was seen with OA. This induction of PPARgamma expression was completely abolished by the PPARgamma antagonist GW9662. 5-Aminosalicylic , an anti- drug routinely used in the management of , also increased PPARgamma expression but to a lesser extent.

The gut microbiota connect diet to the metabolism by producing small molecules via diverse metabolic pathways. In this study we aimed to investigate the dietary preferences of IBD patients, and to explore the interactions among gut microbiota composition, dietary components, and metabolites in relation to IBD.Dietary preferences of IBD patients (including those with ulcerative  [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]) and health controls were investigated, and their gut microbiota were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic analyses of fecal and biopsy samples.

Aqueous suspensions of both solids at pH 7.4 showed negligible payload release whereas a marked delivery was observed in the presence of sodium dithionite due to the rupture of the azo bonds. Besides, a moderate cargo release was observed at acidic pH due to the hydrolysis of the urea bonds that linked the azo derivative onto the external surface of the inorganic scaffolds. In vitro digestion models showed that S1 and S2 microparticles could be used for the controlled release of payload in the reducing colon environment (in which azoreductase enzymes are present). On the other hand, in vivo pharmacokinetic studies in rats showed that safranine O release from S1 microparticles was concentrated in colon. The performance of S2 microparticles for the treatment of  in rats (induced by oral administration of a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  solution) was tested. The controlled release of hydrocortisone from S2 in the colon of injured rats induced marked reduction in colon/body weight ratio and in clinical activity score. Also, histological studies showed a marked decrease in inflammation followed by intensive regeneration and almost normal mucosal structure of the individuals treated with S2.

We recently reported that PLA2 mediates hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) to lysophosphatidylcholine (L-PC) when both are applied to the apical surface of cultured EC monolayers, resulting in increased bacterial translocation (BT) and decreased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Free fatty acids (FFA) are the other products of this reaction, however, their effect on Caco-2 cell permeability has not been reported. In addition to PC, other luminal phospholipids are present at the surface of the enterocyte. PLA2 may also mediate the hydrolysis of luminal phospholipids other than PC. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of phospholipids other than PC and common FFA on intestinal epithelial permeability and BT. Human Caco-2 enterocytes were grown to confluence on porous filters in the apical chamber of a two-chamber cell-culture system. Monolayer integrity and tight-junction permeability were measured as TEER. First, common FFA released by PC hydrolysis were determined using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). In separate experiments, monolayers were treated with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (L-PE), or palmitoleic ,  acids, linoleic acids, and arachidonic  solubilized in solution with PC. The magnitude of BT was determined 2 h after treatment by adding Escherichia coli C25 to the apical chamber followed by quantitatively culturing basal-chamber samples. Statistical analysis was by the Kurosaki-Wallis test. TLC of PC samples incubated with PLA2 on the apical surface of Caco-2 monolayers demonstrated the production of palmitoleic ,  acids, linoleic acids, and arachidonic . L-PE significantly decreased TEER compared to controls, but to a lesser degree than L-PC alone. L-PE had no effects on BT. Palmitoleic  and  likewise significantly decreased TEER compared to controls, however, less than L-PC. All FFA tested had no effect on BT. Phospholipids applied to the apical surface of enterocytes, such as those found in vivo in mucus, can be hydrolyzed by the enzyme PLA2 resulting in lysophospholipid and FFA species that can alter enterocyte monolayer permeability. However, FFA and L-PL, other than L-PC, appear to have no effect to stimulate BT.

Recently we reported that one of the serotonin-fatty  conjugates, docosahexaenoyl serotonin (DHA-5-HT), previously found in gut tissue of mouse and pig, attenuates the IL-23-IL-17 signaling axis in LPS-stimulated mice macrophages. However, its presence and effects in humans remained to be elucidated. Here, we report for the first time its identification in human intestinal (colon) tissue, along with a series of related N-acyl serotonins. Furthermore, we tested these fatty  conjugates for their ability to inhibit the release of IL-17 and CCL-20 by stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Serotonin conjugates with palmitic  (PA-5-HT), stearic  (SA-5-HT) and  (OA-5-HT) were detected in higher levels than arachidonoyl serotonin (AA-5-HT) and DHA-5-HT, while eicosapentaenoyl serotonin (EPA-5-HT) could not be quantified. Among these, DHA-5-HT was the most potent in inhibiting IL-17 and CCL-20, typical Th17 pro-inflammatory mediators, by Concanavalin A (ConA)-stimulated human PBMCs.

Both the amount and type of dietary fat modulate intestinal immune function. Absorption of long-chain fatty acids stimulates lymphocyte flux and lymphocyte blastogenesis in intestinal lymphatics. Long-chain fatty  absorption also significantly enhances migration of T lymphocytes to Peyer's patches, possibly due to up-regulation of adhesion molecules, such as alpha4-integrin and L-selectin. Lipoproteins are involved in stimulation of lymphocyte function by both receptor-dependent and independent mechanisms. However, unsaturated fatty acids at higher concentrations have a suppressive effect on cell-mediated immunity via eicosanoid release, receptor affinity changes or interactions with intracellular signal transduction. Fat absorption also influences various other cells in the intestinal mucosa: increased cytokine release from intestinal epithelial cells follows long-chain fatty  absorption. In Crohn's , elemental diets and total parenteral nutrition often induce remission, possibly by reducing antigenic load on activated immune cells in the intestine and, thus, down-regulating hyperreactive CD4 cells. Dietary  supplements caused an immunological reversal effect in the intestinal immune system of animals fed an elemental diet. An excess of long-chain fatty acids in an elemental diet, therefore, may negate its beneficial effect on gut-associated lymphoid tissues in Crohn's . In contrast, supplemental dietary fish oil apparently tends to prevent relapse of Crohn's . Because dietary fat intake is closely associated with immunological function of the intestinal mucosa, careful manipulation of dietary fat can be important in management of this .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27459113>Preventive and curative effect of Pistacia lentiscus oil in experimental .</a></h2><p>to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of the Pistacia lentiscus oil in experimental  model. was induced in male rats by instillation of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS) in all groups. The experimental groups consisted of: 5 rats received Lentisc oil 2months before  induction (preventive group), 5 rats received the oil on the day of  induction (curative group) and 5 control rats. Lentisc oil was extracted from the ripe fruit of the plant by the cold press method and was analyzed by spectro-chromatography. Lentisc oil has been inserted with a standard diet at the dose of 30mg oil/100g of food/rat.The lentisc oil sample is composed mainly by  (47.96%), Palmitic  (27.94%) and Linoleic  (20.22%).There was a significant difference between control rats and treated rats with lentisc oil concerned body mass (p=0.009), bleeding index (p=0.005 and p=0.018) and diarrhea (p=0.012). Histological examination revealed a clear difference between the control and preventive groups with disappearance of erosion, decreased of cryptitis, irregular crypts and crypt loss in the preventive group. Curative group showed a significant decrease of ulceration, hyperplasia, cryptitis, irregular crypts and crypt loss compared to the control group. There was an attenuation of inflammation in the preventive group compared to the curative group without statistically significant.Lentisc oil administration could provide a protective effect on intestinal inflammation in  rats induced by TNBS mainly when it is administered at a young age in preventive mode. This beneficial effect would involve a modification of arachidonic  metabolism.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Moreover, colonic arachidonic  (ARA) proportions are increased and  (OA) proportions are decreased. Fish oils are protective in IBD patients however, a side-by-side comparison between effects of fish oils, ARA and OA has not been made. We therefore, compared effects of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) versus ARA and OA on ICAM-1 expression in Caco-2 enterocytes. To validate our model we showed that dexamethasone, sulfasalazine and PPARalpha (GW7647) or PPARgamma (troglitazone) agonists significantly lowered ICAM-1 expression. ICAM-1 expression of non-stimulated and cytokine stimulated Caco-2 cells cultured for 22 days with ARA was significant higher as compared to EPA and OA. Furthermore, ARA increased NF-kappaB activation in a reporter cell-line as compared to EPA. Antibody array analysis of multiple  proteins particularly showed an increased monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and angiogenin production and a decreased interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 production by ARA as compared to EPA. Our results showed that ARA but not EPA and OA activates NF-kappaB and elevates ICAM-1 expression in Caco-2 enterocytes. It suggests that replacement of ARA by EPA or OA in the colon mucosa might have beneficial effects for IBD patients. Finally, we suggest that the pro- effects of ARA versus EPA and OA are not related to PPARgamma activation and/or eicosanoid formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14656710>Linoleic  induces interleukin-8 production by Crohn's human intestinal smooth muscle cells via arachidonic  metabolites.</a></h2><p>Previously we reported that linoleic  (LA), but not , caused a marked increase in the secretion of IL-8 by Crohn's human intestinal smooth muscle (HISM) cells. Antioxidants inhibited this response, implicating a role for oxidative stress and NF-kappaB, a transcription factor for IL-8 that is activated by oxidative stress. In this study, we examined two mechanisms whereby LA, the dietary precursor for arachidonic  (AA), could increase the production of IL-8 via activation of AA pathways: 1) by generation of reactive oxygen species by the AA-pathway enzymes to activate NF-kappaB or 2) by AA metabolites. Normal and Crohn's HISM cells were exposed to LA, oxidizing solution (Ox), or oxidizing solution enriched with LA (OxLA). Exposure of cells to Ox or OxLA induced oxidative stress as determined by thiobarbituric  reactive substances. In normal cells, Ox but not LA activated NF-kappaB as determined by transfection experiments and Western blot. In Crohn's cells, NF-kappaB was spontaneously activated and was not further activated by Ox or LA. In contrast, TNF-alpha markedly increased activation of NF-kappaB in both normal and Crohn's cells. These results indicated that LA did not increase IL-8 by activating NF-kappaB, so we evaluated the second mechanism of an effect of AA metabolites. In normal cells, OxLA, but not LA, markedly stimulated IL-8, whereas in Crohn's cells, both OxLA and LA stimulated IL-8. OxLA, also stimulated production of AA metabolites leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)), PGE(2), and thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2)) by normal and Crohn's cells. To determine whether AA metabolites mediated the IL-8 response, cells were treated with OxLA plus indomethacin (Indo), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, and nordihydroguaiaretic  (NDGA), a lipoxygenase inhibitor. Both Indo and NDGA blocked the IL-8 response to OxLA. To determine more specifically a role for AA metabolites, AA was used. Similar to OxLA, OxAA stimulated production of IL-8 and AA metabolites. Pinane thromboxane, a selective thromboxane synthase inhibitor and receptor blocker, inhibited OxAA stimulation of TXB(2) and IL-8 in a dose-response manner. MK886, a selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, inhibited OxAA stimulation of LTB(4) and IL-8 also in a dose-response manner. Analysis of specific gene products by RT-PCR demonstrated that HISM cells expressed receptors for both thromboxane and LTB(4). We conclude that AA metabolites mediated the IL-8 response to LA in HISM cells. Both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways were involved. LA did not increase IL-8 by activating NF-kappaB, but NF-kappaB appeared to be involved, because LA increased IL-8 only in situations where NF-kappaB was activated, either spontaneously in Crohn's cells or by Ox in normal cells. We speculate that AA metabolites increased IL-8 production by enhancing NF-kappaB-dependent transcription of IL-8.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13441703>Gastrointestinal absorption with -I 131 and L-methionine-S35 in patients with ulcerative colitis.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16771071>Importance of lipids in the nutritional treatment of  .</a></h2><p>Over the last decades, scientific advances in the knowledge of anti- properties of lipids have lead to the development of new formulas for enteral and parenteral nutrition. These products have been utilised as a treatment for a variety of  . In this review we expose the effects of lipids used in enteral nutriton on different  pathologies such as , atherosclerosis, lung fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and others. During  , eicosanoids are produced from polyunsaturated fatty acids present in cellular membranes.  activity of these molecules depends on the nature of their precursors: when arachidonic  (n-6) is present, pro- molecules are released, whereas eicosapentaenoic  (n-3)-derived eicosanoids are weakly . In this way, fish oils, rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, increase the content of eicosapentaenoic-eicosanoids and decrease arachidonic  in immune and endothelial cells leading to a lower  activity. Likewise,  exhibits anti- effects by preventing the release of particular chemotactic molecules. In summary, enteral diets supplemented with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and  benefits the treatment of patients with  pathologies, leading to better outcomes, and decreasing the doses of anti- drugs, which exhibit important secondary effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30378628>The protective effects of Poria cocos-derived polysaccharide CMP33 against IBD in mice and its molecular mechanism.</a></h2><p>In this study, the protective effects of a carboxymethyl polysaccharide CMP33 from Poria cocos against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were investigated using TNBS-induced  in mice. The results showed that CMP33 markedly ameliorated the severity of , including a 2-fold decrease in the mortality rate, a 50% decrease in disease activity index, and a 36%-44% decrease in macro- or microscopic histopathological score, compared with TNBS administration. Moreover, CMP33 decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines in the colon tissue and serum of colitic mice. Using iTRAQ-coupled- nano-HPLC-MS/MS-based proteomics, the protein profiles after TNBS, high- or low-dose CMP33 and salazosulfapyridine (SASP) treatments were compared and many differentially expressed proteins were identified. Among them, 7 proteins (Hmgcs2, Fabp2, Hp, B4galnt2, B3gnt6, Sap and Ca1) were proposed to be the common targeting protein group (TPG) of CMP33 and drug SASP. Particularly, some targeting proteins were CMP33-dose-specific: high-dose-specific TPG (Mtco3, Gal-6, Mptx, S100 g and Hpx) and low-dose-specific TPG (Zg16, Hexb, Insl5, Cept1, Hspb6 and Ifi27l2b), suggesting the complex acting mechanism of CMP33. GC-TOF-MS-based metabolomics revealed that  and dihydrotestosterone could be the common targets of CMP33 and SASP. By integrative analysis of proteomics and metabolomics, key protein-metabolite pathways (PMP) were identified, PMP for high-dose: 2-hydroxybutyric  - (GPT, GGH) - glutathione - ALB - testosterone - TTR - dihydrotestosterone; PMP for low-dose: (PYY, FABP2, HMGCS2) -  - TTR - dihydrotestosterone. In total, these results demonstrated the protective effects of CMP33 against IBD in mice through the potential TPG and PMP.</p></html>
