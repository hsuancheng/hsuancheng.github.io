To address this question, obese fa/fa Zucker rats were submitted to a 13-month treatment by  (30 mg/kg/day p.o.). Vehicle-treated obese fa/fa Zucker rats exhibited an important mortality (72%), which was markedly reduced by  (22%, P<0.05). Mortality in control lean fa/+ rats attained 12%.  diminished the elevation in urinary protein excretion, plasma creatinine and urea nitrogen levels, and reduced the extent of glomerular and tubulo-interstitial lesions together with a reduction of urinary monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 excretion in fa/fa Zucker rats.  treatment prevented the rise in plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels, and partially corrected low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein (LDL/HDL) cholesterol ratio in fa/fa Zucker rats. Therefore, prolonged  treatment preserves renal function and metabolic profile, and substantially increases survival in obese fa/fa Zucker rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15149348>ACE inhibitor and angiotensin type I receptor antagonist in combination reduce renal damage in obese Zucker rats.</a></h2><p>In this study, we evaluated whether a combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, benazepril (B), with an angiotensin type I receptor antagonist (AT1RA),  (I), is as effective or more than drugs as monotherapy in controlling renal damage in obese Zucker rats (OZR), a model of metabolic syndrome.During six months, G1 (OZR receiving no treatment); G2 (OZR with B 10 mg/kg/day); G3 (OZR with I 50mg/kg/day); and G4 (OZR with B 5mg/kg/day + I 25 mg/kg/day). Kidneys were processed for light microscopy (LM) and immunohistochemistry, including antibodies against interstitial alpha-smooth-muscle-actin (alpha-SMA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), transforming growth factor-beta(1)(TGF-beta 1), and collagen (COL) I, III, and IV.All treated groups presented similar reduction in blood pressure compared with untreated OZR. However, animals from G4 (B + I) showed better control on proteinuria together with a higher creatinine clearance. Additionally, G4 showed a significant (P < 0.05) lower kidney weight; smaller glomerular area; lower glomerulosclerosis score; lower percentage of tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and interstitial alpha-SMA; lower tubular PAI-1 score; lower percentage of COL I, III, and IV in renal interstitium; and lower wall/lumen ratio in renal vessels, when compared with the other groups. OZR treated with B and/or I showed a better outcome (P < 0.01) in the carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in comparison with untreated OZR.These results suggest that combined therapy using B and I is more effective than therapy with either drug at monotherapy for controlling renal damage in this animal model.

Analysis of covariance and logistic multivariate regression models were used to estimate the blood pressure (BP) outcomes of 73,012 patients during 13 months of treatment with olmesartan, losartan, valsartan, and . Results were adjusted by baseline BP, starting dose, year, age, sex, race, body mass index, comorbid conditions, and concomitant medications of patients. All ARBs led to sustained reductions in BP, but with significant differences in the magnitude of BP reduction. Raw mean systolic BP/diastolic BP reductions with losartan, valsartan, , and olmesartan were 9.3/4.9 mm Hg, 10.4/5.6 mm Hg, 10.1/5.3 mm Hg, and 12.4/6.8 mm Hg, respectively. Adjusting for all covariates, the overall BP reductions with olmesartan were 1.88/0.86 mm Hg, 1.21/0.52 mm Hg, and 0.89/0.51 mm Hg greater than for losartan, valsartan, and , respectively, and mean differences were higher for monotherapy: 2.43/1.16 mm Hg; 2.18/0.93 mm Hg; 1.44/0.91 mm Hg, respectively (all P values <.0001). Adjusted odds ratios of the JNC 7 goal attainment for losartan, valsartan, and  compared with olmesartan were 0.76, 0.86, and 0.91 (P<.05). Differences were also found in subpopulations: African Americans, diabetics, and obese/overweight patients but not all of these reached statistical significance. A broad choice of ARBs may be required to get patients to treatment goals.Â© 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17353513>Direct Renin inhibition with aliskiren in obese patients with arterial hypertension.</a></h2><p>Current guidelines from the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommend first-line treatment with a thiazide diuretic but do not provide specific guidance for obese patients. The renin system is activated in -associated arterial hypertension. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the oral direct renin inhibitor aliskiren could provide additive blood pressure lowering in obese patients with hypertension (body mass index >or=30 kg/m(2); mean sitting diastolic blood pressure: 95 to 109 mm Hg) who had not responded to 4 weeks of treatment with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg. After a 2- to 4-week washout, 560 patients received single-blind HCTZ (25 mg) for 4 weeks; 489 nonresponders were randomly assigned to double-blind aliskiren (150 mg),  (150 mg), amlodipine (5 mg), or placebo for 4 weeks added to HCTZ (25 mg), followed by 8 weeks on double the initial doses of aliskiren, , or amlodipine. After 8 weeks of double-blind treatment (4 weeks on the higher dose), aliskiren/HCTZ lowered blood pressure by 15.8/11.9 mm Hg, significantly more (P<0.0001) than placebo/HCTZ (8.6/7.9 mm Hg). Aliskiren/HCTZ provided blood pressure reductions similar to those with /HCTZ and amlodipine/HCTZ (15.4/11.3 and 13.6/10.3 mm Hg, respectively), with similar tolerability to placebo/HCTZ. Adverse event rates were highest with amlodipine/HCTZ because of a higher incidence of peripheral edema (11.1% versus 0.8% to 1.6% in other groups). In conclusion, combination treatment with aliskiren is a highly effective and well-tolerated therapeutic option for obese patients with hypertension who fail to achieve blood pressure control with first-line thiazide diuretic treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16739358>[Arterial hypertension in obese patients. Rationale for a prospective medical care study in the family doctor's practice].</a></h2><p>Patients with high blood pressure are often overweight or even obese. Conversely, some 43% of overweight and obese patients suffer from hypertension. Diabetes (16.7%), coronary heart disease (15.0%) and nephropathy (7.8%) are common additional findings. The cardiac risk in these patients is thus appreciably elevated. Currently, a prospective medical care study "Best practice with  in overweight and obese patients" (BIG) - is being conducted throughout Germany. In this study obese hypertensive patients of general practitioners are receiving the AT1 blocker , as monotherapy or in fixed combination with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide over a period of 3 months. Obese patients and nonobese patients are compared with regard to the following variables: drug utilization, blood pressure decrease, responder rates, normalization rates, decrease in the number of patients with (micro)albuminurea, changes in patient risk profile (e.g. after SCORE), and tolerability. The study is expected to provide new information on the efficacy, tolerability and safety of  in regard to pressure reduction and its protective effect on the kidneys and heart in overweight patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21404225>Renal protection with angiotensin receptor blockers: where do we stand.</a></h2><p>The increasing burden on health care providers from chronic kidney disease (CKD) is due to the escalating prevalence of , hypertension and type 2 diabetes. The gradual decline in kidney function in the presence of these risk factors is also associated with increased cardiovascular disease. Excess angiotensin II production by the renin-angiotensin system is responsible, at least in part, for development of hypertension and for damage in the kidneys and the cardiovascular system. Pharmacological targeting of the renin-angiotensin system not only reduces blood pressure, but may also provides more direct vascular protection. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are better tolerated than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and, thus, may be a more practical therapeutic option. Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of , losartan, telmisartan and valsartan in the management of CKD. All ARBs tested to date have proved effective in improving at least some aspects of renal dysfunction. Few within-class comparative studies exist. Telmisartan provides superior reductions in proteinuria to losartan, however, even when blood pressures are equalized with concomitant antihypertensives. This superiority is probably linked to higher receptor affinity, longer plasma half-life and higher lipophilicity of telmisartan compared with other ARBs. The reduction of proteinuria with ARBs is also linked to improved cardiovascular outcomes. After a decade of research, there is now substantial evidence to show that the use of ARBs provides an efficacious treatment option for the prevention of renal disease progression in patients with hypertension and/or diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21627336>Combination delapril/manidipine as antihypertensive therapy in high-risk patients.</a></h2><p>The majority of patients with hypertension, and in particular high-risk patients or those with diabetes mellitus or renal dysfunction, are likely to require combination therapy with at least two antihypertensive agents (from different classes) to achieve their blood pressure (BP) target. The delapril/manidipine fixed-dose combination consists of two antihypertensive agents with different, yet complementary, mechanisms of action. Delapril/manidipine has demonstrated short- and long-term antihypertensive efficacy in a number of clinical studies in patients with hypertension with an inadequate response to monotherapy. Comparative studies have demonstrated that delapril/manidipine is as effective as enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in patients with hypertension with an inadequate response to monotherapy, and as effective as /HCTZ, losartan/HCTZ, olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ, ramipril/HCTZ and valsartan/HCTZ in reducing BP in patients with hypertension and diabetes, or in obese patients with hypertension. Therapy with delapril/manidipine also appears to exert beneficial effects that extend beyond a reduction in BP, including nephroprotective activity and an improvement in fibrinolytic balance, supporting its value as a treatment option in these patient populations at high or very high cardiovascular risk because of the presence of organ damage, diabetes or renal disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16331093>Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system: a key therapeutic strategy to reduce renal and cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes.</a></h2><p>Diabetes (particularly type 2 diabetes) represents a global health problem of epidemic proportions. Individuals with diabetes are not only more likely to develop hypertension, dyslipidemia, and , but are also at a significantly higher risk for coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke. Angiotensin II plays a key pathophysiological role in the progression of diabetic renal disease, and blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II antagonists has therefore become an important therapeutic strategy to reduce renal and cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes. Several studies have demonstrated the effects of angiotensin II antagonists on the reduction of albuminuria and the progression of renal disease from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria. More importantly, several endpoint trials have shown that the antiproteinuric effects of losartan and  translate into cardiovascular and renoprotective benefits beyond blood pressure lowering, thereby delaying the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation by several years. These and other studies indicate that angiotensin II antagonists not only improve survival and quality of life of patients with diabetic nephropathy, but also have the potential to reduce the substantial healthcare burden associated with managing these patients. ACEi also appear to exert similar beneficial effects in diabetic patients, but whether clinically significant differences in renoprotection or mortality exist between angiotensin II antagonists and ACEi in patients with type 2 diabetes remains to be fully investigated in appropriate head-to-head studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18046109>The efficacy and safety of initial use of /hydrochlorothiazide fixed-dose combination in hypertensive patients with and without high cardiovascular risk.</a></h2><p>A post hoc pooled analysis of 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled force-titration studies assessed the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of 7 to 8 weeks' once-daily fixed-dose /hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 300/25 mg in 796 stage 1 or 2 hypertensive patients according to age (65 years or older or younger than 65) (n=121 or 675) and presence or absence of  (n=378 or 414), type 2 diabetes (n=99 or 697), and high World Health Organization-defined cardiovascular risk (n=593 or 202).

Angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT1R) blockers (ARBs) reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus by mostly unknown molecular mechanisms. To identify new antidiabetic mechanisms of ARBs, we studied the regulation of adiponectin by angiotensin II (Ang II) and different ARBs in murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes and obese Zucker rats. Adiponectin protein expression was markedly stimulated by Ang II (5 nmol/L), which was inhibited by blockade of the AT2R, and further enhanced by the ARB . -mediated adiponectin upregulation started beyond the concentrations needed for AT1R blockade and was also present in the absence of Ang II, implicating an AT1R-independent mechanism of action. Recently, certain ARBs (, telmisartan) were identified as ligands of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma. Telmisartan also stimulated adiponectin protein expression, whereas the non-PPARgamma-activating ARB eprosartan had no effect. Blockade of PPARgamma activation by the PPARgamma antagonist GW9662 markedly inhibited -induced adiponectin expression. Cognate mRNA levels of adiponectin were not affected by ARBs. Kinetic studies using the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide showed that  prevented the cellular depletion of adiponectin protein. Finally, administration of  to obese Zucker rats improved insulin sensitivity and attenuated adiponectin serum depletion. The present study demonstrates that AT2R activation and certain ARBs induce adiponectin in adipocytes, which was associated with an improvement of parameters of insulin sensitivity in vivo. ARB-induced adiponectin stimulation is likely to be mediated via PPARgamma activation involving a post-transcriptional mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20826135> enhances GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport in skeletal muscle cells.</a></h2><p>, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker has been reported to alleviate metabolic disorder in animal studies and human clinical trials. Although this effect may be related to the ability of  to serve as a partial agonist for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-Î³, the target tissues on which  acts remain poorly defined. As muscle glucose transport plays a major role in maintaining systemic glucose homeostasis, we investigated the effect of  on glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells. In C2C12 myotubes, 24-h treatment with  significantly promoted both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport. In L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts,  caused a significant increase in glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface in a concentration-dependent manner. Valsartan, another angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker had no effect on either glucose uptake or GLUT4 translocation, implying that these actions on glucose transport are independent of angiotensin II receptor blockade. Moreover,  exerted these effects in an additive manner with insulin, but not with acute treatment for 3 h, suggesting that they may require the synthesis of new proteins. Finally, in insulin-resistant Zucker fatty rat,  (50 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks) significantly ameliorated insulin resistance without increasing weight gain. We conclude that  has a direct action, which can be additive to insulin, of promoting glucose transport in skeletal muscle. This may be beneficial for ameliorating -related glucose homeostasis derangement.Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, angiotensin (Ang) II is able to induce insulin resistance and an inflammatory state through Ang II receptor type 1 (AT1R). Accordingly, we examined whether inhibition of AT1R with  (IRB) can protect against the development of insulin resistance in obese Zucker rats (OZRs). IRB-treatment improved the insulin-stimulated insulin receptor (IR) phosphorylation at tyrosine (Tyr) residues 1158, 1162, 1163 (involved in activation of the IR kinase) and at Tyr972 (involved in substrate recognition). AT1R blockade also originated a dramatic increase in the phosphorylation of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta. This was accompanied by a decrease in phosphorylation of IR on serine (Ser) 994, a residue that seems to be implicated in the regulation of IR kinase in OZR. In this study, we demonstrated that Ser994 of IR is a direct substrate for TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a new member of the IKK-related kinase family. TBK1 was found to co-immunoprecipitate with the IR, in the liver of OZR supporting an in vivo association between the IR and TBK1. Interestingly, a marked increase in the association between TBK1 and the IR was found in the liver of OZR as well as in other models of insulin resistance/diabetes. Taken together, these findings suggest that TBK1 could be involved in the insulin resistance mechanism related with IR Ser994 phosphorylation in a genetic model of diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19793594>Neuroendocrine characterization and anorexigenic effects of telmisartan in diet- and glitazone-induced weight gain.</a></h2><p>Telmisartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonistic properties.

It has been proposed that heart failure, including HFpEF, represents overlapping syndromes that may have different prognoses. We present an exploratory study of patients enrolled in the  in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction Study (I-PRESERVE) using latent class analysis (LCA) with validation using the Candesartan in Heart failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity (CHARM)-Preserved study to identify HFpEF subgroups.In total, 4113 HFpEF patients randomized to  or placebo were characterized according to 11 clinical features.

BMI did not significantly change after the study. Among the inflammatory parameters, the concentrations of adiponectin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) significantly improved after treatment; however, the changes in the concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and leptin did not reach statistical significance. Moreover, the changes in these five parameters following treatment were moderately correlated with the BMI values obtained at the initiation of the study, and the improvements were particularly prominent in those with a BMI greater than 25.

Paradoxically, in HF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFREF), a high body mass index (BMI) appears to be beneficial. Approximately 50% of HF patients have a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFPEF). However, there are few data regarding the relationship between BMI and outcomes in HFPEF.Baseline characteristics and cardiovascular outcomes were assessed in the 4109 patients (mean age, 72 years; mean follow-up, 49.5 months) in the  in HF with Preserved Ejection Fraction (I-PRESERVE) trial.

An integrated CV risk management approach is being adopted: aggressive blood pressure (BP) control is important in patients with high CVD risk, and well-tolerated antihypertensive agents with protective benefits beyond BP lowering are advantageous. The renin-angiotensin system is integral to blood pressure control and is well established in the pathophysiology of CVD. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are highly efficacious, persistent, well-tolerated antihypertensive agents, with additional benefits in comorbid hypertension, CV pathologies, end-organ damage, and, in diabetes, diabetic nephropathy or metabolic syndrome.

We sought to determine angiotensin II- ATR participation on a diet-induced gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) experimental model. Female Wistar rats were fed with a standard or hypercaloric diet for 7 weeks. Half of the animals were mated and became pregnant from week 4-7. Animals were treated with saline,  (30âmg/kg) or metformin (320âmg/kg) for the last two weeks of the protocol. Weight gain, systolic blood pressure (BP), oral glucose tolerance test and vascular contractility were measured at the last day of the protocol (day 19-20 of pregnancy). Hypercaloric diet increased blood glucose, impaired glucose tolerance test, and increased BP in pregnant rats, fulfilling criteria for GDM. Both drugs decreased impaired GTT and relative hyperglycemia. Metformin had no effect on BP but prevented weight increase. In isolated aortas,  and metformin decreased vasoconstriction only of non-pregnant hypercaloric diet fed animals. Results support angiotensin II/ ATR involvement in BP and glucose homeostasis disturbances observed in present GDM model.

Our previous studies demonstrated that administration of a subpressor dose of angiotensin (Ang) II sensitizes subsequent Ang II-elicited hypertension. The present study tested whether high-fat diet (HFD) feeding also sensitizes the Ang II-elicited hypertensive response and whether HFD-induced sensitization is mediated by an increase in renin-angiotensin system activity and inflammatory mechanisms in the brain. HFD did not increase baseline blood pressure, but enhanced the hypertensive response to Ang II compared with a normal-fat diet.

Furthermore, central pretreatment with tumor necrosis factor-Î± mimicked the sensitizing action of a central subpressor dose of Ang II, whereas central pentoxifylline or minocycline abolished this Ang II-induced sensitization. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of lamina terminalis tissue indicated that HFD feeding, central tumor necrosis factor-Î±, or a central subpressor dose of Ang II upregulated mRNA expression of several components of the renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokines, whereas inhibition of Ang II type 1 receptor and of inflammation reversed these changes.

A previous study revealed that rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD) have an enhanced hypertensive response to subsequent angiotensin II administration that is mediated at least, in part, by increased activity of brain renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokines. This study tested whether leptin mediates this HFD-induced sensitization of angiotensin II-elicited hypertension by interacting with brain renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokine mechanisms. Rats fed an HFD for 3 weeks had significant increases in white adipose tissue mass, plasma leptin levels, and mRNA expression of leptin and its receptors in the lamina terminalis and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. Central infusion of a leptin receptor antagonist during HFD feeding abolished HFD sensitization of angiotensin II-elicited hypertension. Furthermore, central infusion of leptin mimicked the sensitizing action of HFD. Concomitant central infusions of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist , the tumor necrosis factor-Î± synthesis inhibitor pentoxifylline, or the inhibitor of microglial activation minocycline prevented the sensitization produced by central infusion of leptin.

HF-PEF commonly occurs in elderly patients, especially women, with comorbidities of hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, diabetes, myocardial ischemia, and . HF-PEF is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Although two large multicenter randomized, placebo-controlled trials evaluating an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in patients with HF-PEF did not demonstrate any statistically significant benefit in their primary end points, they did suggest that these agents may have a modest role in reducing HF hospitalizations. Although calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers may be of benefit in patients with HF-PEF, large clinical trial data are not available to support their routine use in all patients with HF-PEF. Subgroup analysis does not support the use of digoxin in patients with HF-PEF in sinus rhythm. Current therapeutic recommendations for HF-PEF are aimed at 1) management of HF symptoms with sodium and fluid restriction along with diuretics for volume overload and 2) treatment of concomitant comorbidities, especially hypertension, rate and possibly rhythm control of atrial fibrillation, and evaluation and treatment of myocardial ischemia and anemia.

From 10% to 30% of the adult population in industrialized countries has MetSyndr, which effectively predicts the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and CV disease. Because of the complex etiology of MetSyndr, a multi-targeted, integrated therapeutic approach is required to simultaneously treat high BP, , lipid disorders and T2D (if present), to fully protect CV, cerebrovascular and renal systems. If lifestyle modification (weight control, diet, exercise, smoking cessation, moderation of alcohol intake) is ineffective, pharmaco-theraphy should be added to treat simultaneously the lipid- and non-lipid CV risk factors. Patients with HTN and MetSyndr should be started on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, unless contraindicated. The ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce the odds of developing new onset T2D and also decrease albuminuria. The ACE inhibitors provide cardioprotective and renoprotective benefits beyond their effect on BP; they also improve IR. The ARBs are renoprotective in addition to being cardioprotective. Long-acting calcium channel blockers are also recommended in hypertensive patients with MetSyndr; these drugs also improve IR. Thiazides (at low doses) and selected ss-blockers can be given to patients with HTN and MetSyndr. Celiprolol in combination with diuretics has a favorable effect on glucose tolerance and IR in patients with HTN and MetSyndr, and spironolactone added to ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy provides additional reno- and CV protective benefits in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Carvedilol, a ss-blocker with vasodilating properties, added to ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, is effective in preventing worsening of microalbuminuria in patients with HTN and MetSyndr; it also improves IR and glycemic control. Most patients eventually require two or more antihypertensive drugs to reach BP goal. It is recommended that therapy in patients whose BP is more than 20/10 mm Hg above target at diagnosis be initiated with a combination of antihypertensive drugs, administered either as individual drugs or as fixed-dose formulations. Treatment with fixed-dose combinations, such as  + hydrochlorothiazide provides good BP control in more than two-thirds of hypertensive patients with MetSyndr. Lipid and BP targets are reached in a high percent of patients with HTN and CV disease treated with a combination of amlodipine + atorvastatin. In conclusion, hypertensive patients with the MetSyndr be treated aggressively for each component of the syndrome to provide CV, cerebrovascular and renal protection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17532722>Antihypertensive effect of  and predictors of response in -associated hypertension : a prospective, open-label study.</a></h2><p>-associated hypertension is difficult to treat and puts patients at a substantially increased risk of cardiovascular events.  has previously been shown to effectively lower blood pressure (BP) in high-risk groups including patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or nephropathy, and may therefore also be suitable for the treatment of -associated hypertension.

Main outcome measures were BP reduction (primary parameter of effectiveness) and BP response rates after 3 months, as well as adverse events (AEs). Independent predictors of poor control were identified in a multivariate proportional odds model.All of the patients were Caucasian, 50.5% were females, mean age was 62.1 +/- 11.1 years, mean bodyweight was 88.6 +/- 15.4kg, and mean body mass index (BMI) was 30.7 +/- 4.8 kg/m(2). Almost all the patients were overweight or obese (92.3%). From a baseline value of 162/94mm Hg, systolic and diastolic BP were reduced by a mean of -23/-12mm Hg after 3 months. 66.1% of the patients were responders (reduction of diastolic BP >/=10mm Hg), and 48.0% achieved BP normalisation (i.e. <140/90mm Hg). 79% of patients met their individual treatment goals as defined by the treating physician (mean 135/80mm Hg).

We explored the potential for the anti-hypertensive angiotensin II type 1-receptor (ATR(1)) antagonists to improve insulin sensitivity through modulation of the nuclear receptor PPARgamma, in vitro and in vivo compared to the potent insulin sensitizer, rosiglitazone.PPARgamma modulation by ATR(1) antagonists was measured first by direct recruitment of PGC-1, followed by trans-activation reporter assays in cells, and promotion of adipogenesis in fibroblast and pre-adipocyte cell lines. Improvement of insulin sensitivity was measured as changes in levels of glucose, insulin, and adiponectin in ob/ob mice.Telmisartan, candesartan, , and losartan (but not valsartan or olmesartan) each served as bona fide PPARgamma ligands in vitro, with EC(50) values between 3 and 5 micro mol/l. However, only telmisartan, and to a lesser extent candesartan, resulted in significant PPARgamma agonism in cells. In vivo, although rosiglitazone significantly lowered both glucose (33%, p<0.01) and insulin (61%, p<0.01) levels and increased expression of adiponectin (74%, p<0.001), sartan treatment had no effect.Many members of the sartan family of ATR(1) antagonists are PPARgamma ligands in cell-free assays but their modulation of PPARgamma in cells is relatively weak. Furthermore, none appear to improve insulin sensitivity in a rodent model under conditions where other insulin sensitizers, including rosiglitazone, do.

However, only a few studies have addressed the molecular mechanisms involved in this association.The current study was undertaken to determine whether an Ang II receptor blocker () is effective in improving insulin resistance in adipose tissue from obese Zucker rats, a model of metabolic syndrome.Ten-week-old male obese Zucker rats (fa/fa) were treated daily with either vehicle or 50 mg/kg  for 6 months, and their age-matched lean (+/?) (lean Zucker rats) was used as a control. We determined systolic blood pressure (SBP), together with plasma levels of insulin, triglycerides, cholesterol and glucose. In addition, we evaluated insulin signaling through the insulin receptor/insulin receptor substrate-1/phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/Akt/glucose transporter 4 pathway as well as the inflammatory status of adipose tissue.Obese Zucker rats displayed hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperinsulinemia and hypercholesterolemia and increased SBP together with decreased activation of insulin signaling through the insulin receptor/insulin receptor substrate-1/phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/Akt pathway in adipose tissue as well as increased adipocytes size, macrophage infiltration and augmented levels of inflammatory mediators such tumor necrosis factor-alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and Ang II. Chronic  treatment resulted in an improvement of all alterations.The present study provides substantial information that demonstrates that long-term selective Ang II blockade ameliorates insulin resistance in adipose tissue from a model of metabolic syndrome via a mechanism that could involve the modulation of insulin signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17259791>The effects of  and telmisartan on metabolic parameters and blood pressure in obese, insulin resistant, hypertensive patients.</a></h2><p>, hypertension, dyslipidemia and glucose intolerance cluster in the insulin resistance syndrome. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are able to reduce insulin resistance. Furthermore, among ARB, telmisartan displays the property of stimulating PPARgamma. The aim of the study was to examine if and to what extent treatment with  and telmisartan induces variations in metabolic parameters in insulin resistant, hypertensive subjects. Forty-six non diabetic, obese, insulin-resistant, hypertensive patients took part in the study. They were divided into 2 groups. Group A (23) was submitted to  150 mg/day, Group B (23) to telmisartan 80 mg/day for 6 months. Adiponectin, glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids (FFA), steady-state plasma insulin and glucose (SSPG), 24-hBP were determined at the beginning and at the end of the study. Both  or telmisartan reduced blood pressure and ameliorated the insulin sensitivity, with increased adiponectin values; in Group B, the amelioration of metabolic parameters was greater than in Group A and the reduction of blood pressure was related with variation of adiponectin levels. Data obtained showed that the antihypertensive action of telmisartan and  is associated with the amelioration of the metabolic picture. The greater impact on the improvement of the metabolic profile showed by telmisartan and the inverse correlation between adiponectin levels and blood pressure may be partly due to the action as partial PPARgamma agonist displayed by telmisartan.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24672122>Effects of angiotensin II-receptor blockers on soluble cell adhesion molecule levels in uncomplicated systemic hypertension: An observational, controlled pilot study in Taiwanese adults.</a></h2><p>Controversy exists as to whether individuals with hypertension without risk factors for atherosclerosis (eg, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia.The aim of this study was to determine whether (1) levels of solubleCAMs (sCAMs) (soluble E-selectin [sE-selectin], soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [sICAM-1 ], soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [sVCAM-1 ], and von Willebrand factor [vWF]) are elevated in Taiwanese adults with uncomplicated essential hypertension without other risk factors; (2) CAM levels increase with severity (stage) of hypertension; and (3) monotherapy with the angiotensin II-receptor blocker (ARB)  modulates CAM expression in a subgroup of these patients.This observational, controlled pilot study was conducted at the Hypertension Clinic, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Adult patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension without other risk factors (eg, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, ) and normotensive controls were eligible. Blood pressure (BP) was determined using 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) in all participants, and the staging of hypertension was classified based on criteria in The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (normotensive, prehypertension, stage I hypertension, and stage II hypertension). The SCAM levels and 24-hour ABPM were measured before and after 8 weeks of open-label  monotherapy in a subgroup of the patients with hypertension. Patients who had difficulty achieving the target BP values on  monotherapy were treated with combination therapy (2 or 3 antihypertensive agents); levels of sCAMs were not measured in these patients. Plasma levels of sE-selectin, the sCAMs, and vWF were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The study comprised 61 patients with uncomplicated essentialhypertension (33 men and 28 women; mean [SD] age, 51 [12] years) and 17 normotensive controls (11 men, 6 women; mean [SD] age, 52 [ 11 ] years). The mean (SD) dose of  was 243 (63) mg. Hypertensive patients had significantly higher circulating levels of sICAM-1 compared with normotensive controls (P = 0.009). No significant differences in levels of sVCAM-1, sE-selectin, or vWF were found between hypertensive patients and controls. The mean sICAM-1 level was significantly higher in the prehypertensive patients compared with normotensive controls (P = 0.03). The mean sE-selectin level was significantly higher in the patients with stage I hypertension compared with the prehypertensive group (P = 0.01). The 18 patients given 8 weeks of  monotherapy showed a significant decrease from baseline in systolic and diastolic BP (both, P = 0.001) and sE-selectin (P= 0.006), but not in sVCAM-1 or sICAM. Forty-three patients did not reach target BP on  monotherapy and thus were treated with combination therapy.Based on the results of this observational, controlled pilotstudy in Taiwanese patients, we suggest that ARB therapy, in addition to reducing BP, has the potential to suppress CAM expression and to improve endothelial dysfunction in hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19997579>Significance of initial blood pressure and comorbidity for the efficacy of a fixed combination of an angiotensin receptor blocker and hydrochlorothiazide in clinical practice.</a></h2><p>Two-thirds of all patients with arterial hypertension need drug combinations to achieve blood pressure (BP) goals. Fixed combinations have high efficacy and result in high patient compliance. 300 mg  plus 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) has been investigated only in clinical trials but not in daily practice.A multicenter, noninterventional, noncontrolled observational study with 8123 patients seen by 1604 physicians in daily practice. BP reduction (office measurements), co-morbid disease and tolerability were documented over a 6-month observational period.At mean baseline BP of 161 +/- 15/94 +/- 10 mmHg, administering of fixed combination resulted in a substantial BP reduction averaging 28 +/- 15/14 +/- 10 mmHg (P < 0.001). Decrease of systolic BP ran parallel with increasing systolic baseline BP (Spearman's Rho -0.731; P < 0.0001; diastolic BP vs diastolic baseline BP Rho 0.740; P < 0.0001), independent from patient characteristics (age, , diabetes or nephropathy) but enhanced with short history of hypertension (P < 0.0001 vs long history), prior beta blockers (P = 0.001 vs prior angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]), prior calcium channel blockers (P = 0.046 vs prior ARBs) and no prior medication (P = 0.012 vs prior ARBs). High compliance (>98%) and low incidence of adverse events (0.66%) were documented.The fixed combination of 300 mg  with 25 mg HCTZ was efficacious and tolerable in an unselected patient population in primary care.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14573338>Role of systolic blood pressureon the progression of kidney damage in an experimental model of type 2 diabetes mellitus, , and hypertension (Zucker rats).</a></h2><p>Hypertension is the main risk factor for the progression of kidney damage in diabetes mellitus. The aim of the present work is to compare the effect of the treatment with  (IRBE) and omapatrilat (OMA), in obese Zucker rats (OZR).A group of 45 OZR were uninephrectomized to accelerate renal damage, and divided into three groups: two experimental groups (IRBE and OMA) treated with 50 and 40 mg/kg/d, respectively; and the control group (CG). At the end of the 8-month follow-up period, animals were killed and the remnant kidney was removed for histologic study and to evaluate the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) expression.Both therapies reduced blood pressure (BP) versus CG (P <.001). Moreover, systolic BP was significantly lower in the OMA group than in the IRBE group (P <.001). Also, both treatments significantly lowered the urinary albumin excretion (P <.001). The OMA treatment exhibited lower values than the IRBE treatment (P <.05). The kidney TGF-beta1 expression was reduced by both treatments to a similar level. The correlation between systolic BP and glomerulosclerosis (GS) is very high (r = 0.90; P <.0001). Also, a high correlation was observed between GS and proteinuria (r = 0.79, P <.0001). The correlation between systolic BP and proteinuria was weaker (r = 0.69; P <.01).These data suggest that both therapies are effective in ameliorating the progression of renal damage in this experimental model. Omapatrilat affords greater long-term renoprotection than , mainly due to its potent effect in reducing systolic BP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12358875>Type 2 diabetes, , and the renal response to blocking the renin system with .</a></h2><p>Our recent studies revealed a striking but variable enhancement of renal vasodilator responses to blockers of the renin-angiotensin system in subjects with diabetes mellitus, possibly reflecting the level of intrarenal activation of the renin-angiotensin system, and thus a risk of nephropathy. As  is a common finding in diabetic individuals, and  has been linked to an increase in plasma angiotensinogen levels, we enrolled diabetic subjects with a wide range of body mass index (BMI) for this study.Twelve Type 2 diabetic subjects in balance on a low sodium diet participated after baseline renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration measurements were made. Each subject then received 150 mg , and renal function was measured every 45 min for 4 h.The average vasodilator response to  was 174 +/- 33 ml/min. No correlation was found between renal plasma flow response to  and duration of diabetes, baseline glucose, or HbA1c level. BMI, our measure of , was highly correlated to the renal response to  (r = 0.7; P = 0.01).Our findings suggest an important role for  in activating the intrarenal renin system, perhaps via production of angiotensinogen.

Thus endogenous ANG II may have a tonic effect on tissue metabolism that could be reversed with ANG II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockade, particularly during adrenergic stimulation. We studied 14 obese men. They were treated for 10 days with the AT1 receptor blocker  or with placebo in a double-blind and crossover fashion. At the end of each treatment period, we assessed skeletal muscle and adipose tissue metabolism using the microdialysis technique. The ethanol dilution technique was applied to follow changes in tissue blood flow. Measurements were obtained at baseline and during application of incremental isoproterenol concentrations through the microdialysis catheter. Blood pressure decreased from 133 +/- 3/84 +/- 3 to 128 +/- 3/79 +/- 2 mmHg for systolic and diastolic blood, respectively (P = 0.02 and 0.006, respectively) with AT1 receptor blockade. Isoproterenol perfusion caused a dose-dependent increase in dialysate glycerol in adipose tissue and in skeletal muscle.  slightly reduced the isoproterenol-induced glycerol response in adipose tissue (P < 0.05 by ANOVA). Ethanol ratio, interstitial glucose supply, and lactate production in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle were similar with placebo and . We conclude that AT1 receptor blockade in obese men does not reveal a major tonic ANG II effect on interstitial glucose supply, lipolysis, or glycolysis in skeletal muscle, either at rest or during beta-adrenergic stimulation. Endogeneous ANG II may slightly increase adipose tissue lipolysis. The mechanism may promote the redistribution of triglycerides from adipose tissue toward other organs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16298156>Treating the metabolic syndrome using angiotensin receptor antagonists that selectively modulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma.</a></h2><p>The metabolic syndrome, defined as a cluster of visceral , insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and elevated blood pressure, is associated with pro-thrombotic, pro-atherogenic and inflammatory risk factors that predispose to cardiovascular disease. Although activators of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARalpha,gamma,delta) in various combinations are under development for treating the metabolic syndrome, they are hampered by adverse effects related to increased adipogenesis, weight gain, fluid overload and carcinogenesis. The recent discovery that telmisartan and , antihypertensive angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1-R) blockers (ARBs), were uniquely capable of activating PPARgamma, has provided a novel approach to addressing the multifactorial components of the metabolic syndrome. Both drugs have established favorable safety profiles and can activate PPARgamma at concentrations potentially achievable at therapeutic doses. Emerging studies have revealed that both these drugs have beneficial metabolic profiles. This information provides a strategic rationale and pharmacological platform for the development of novel dual ARB/PPARgamma agonists to target the metabolic syndrome and its cardiovascular sequelae, for which therapy is presently insufficient or non-existent. Beneficial effects of these agents include increased energy expenditure, improved lipid profile, increased insulin sensitivity, blood pressure reduction, and amelioration of the associated pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic risk profiles. The potential benefit for treatment of the metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular protection, and prevention of related end-organ complications could be of immense clinical value.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18239590>ACE inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade prevent fatty liver and fibrosis in obese Zucker rats.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is a common liver disease in industrialized countries, is associated with , hypertension, and type-2 diabetes (metabolic syndrome). Since angiotensin II (ANG II) has been suggested to play an important role in liver inflammation and fibrosis, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether therapy against renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may provide some beneficial effect in liver of an animal model of metabolic syndrome.For 6 months, obese Zucker rats (OZRs) were treated as follows: OZR-group, OZR + Perindopril (P) group, OZR +  (IRB) group, OZR + Amlodipine (AML) group, and lean Zucker rats (LZRs) group as a control. Livers were evaluated by immunohistochemistry techniques using corresponding antibodies.All treated groups showed a similar reduction in blood pressure compared to untreated OZR. Therapy either with IRB or P improves insulin sensitivity and reduces hepatic enzyme level with respect to untreated OZR. Conversely, AML failed to modify both parameters. Untreated OZR displayed higher hepatic ANG II levels and steatosis together with a marked increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) level compared to LZR. Following RAS inhibition either by P or IRB, a significant reduction (P < 0.01) in the immunostaining of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and TGF-beta1 compared to untreated OZR was observed.These results indicate that ANG II expression is increased in the liver of these animals with steatohepatitis. Furthermore, RAS control by either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or AT1 receptor blockade seems to provide a beneficial modulation concerning the inflammatory response to liver injury in this model. Consequently, blockade of RAS could be a new approach to prevent or to treat patients with NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19167594>Antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of /hydrochlorothiazide in hypertensive patients stratified by body mass index and type 2 diabetes mellitus status: a post hoc subgroup analysis of the /HCTZ Blood Pressure Reductions in Diverse Patient Populations trial.</a></h2><p>This was a post hoc subgroup analysis of efficacy and tolerability data from the /HCTZ Blood Pressure Reductions in Diverse Patient Populations (INCLUSIVE) trial stratified by baseline body mass index (BMI).

Patients received placebo for 4 to 5 weeks, HCTZ 12.5 mg for 2 weeks, /HCTZ 150/12.5 mg for 8 weeks, and /HCTZ 300/25 mg for 8 weeks. Patients were stratified into BMI subgroups based on values at screening. Normal weight was defined as a BMI <or=24.9 kg/m(2), overweight as a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m(2), and  as a BMI >or=30 kg/m(2). The primary efficacy end point was the mean change in SBP from baseline (end of the placebo phase) to week 18 in the overall intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Secondary efficacy end points were the mean changes in SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from baseline to week 18 in each BMI subgroup, the proportions of patients in each BMI subgroup achieving their SBP target (<140 mm Hg [<130 mm Hg for patients with T2DM]) and DBP target (<90 mm Hg [<80 mm Hg for patients with T2DM]), and the mean SBP and DBP responses at the end of each treatment period.The ITT population included 736 patients, of whom 99 (13.5%) were normal weight, 243 (33.0%) were overweight, and 394 (53.5%) were obese. Mean baseline SBP and DBP values were similar across BMI subgroups. Obese patients were generally younger than normal-weight and overweight patients, and numerically more obese patients had T2DM and metabolic syndrome. The mean reductions in SBP and DBP at week 18 were statistically significant in all subgroups (all, P < 0.001); SBP and DBP goals were achieved by a respective 83.8% and 93.9% of normal-weight patients, 75.3% and 87.7% of overweight patients, and 76.9% and 77.2% of obese patients.

Fasting glycaemic control of the JCR : LA-cp rats was marginally improved, at the expense of increased plasma insulin levels ( approximately 50%). Fasting plasma triglycerides were marginally reduced ( approximately 25%), while cholesterol concentrations were unchanged. Elevated concentrations of adiponectin, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were reduced along with severity of glomerular sclerosis. Macrovascular dysfunction (aortic hypercontractile response to noradrenergic stimulus and reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation) was improved and frequency of ischaemic myocardial lesions reduced (62%). reduces markers of inflammation and prothombotic status, improves macrovascular function and reduces glomerular sclerosis and myocardial lesions in a model of the metabolic syndrome.

In the acute study, obese rats received either vehicle (water) or  1 hour before the experiment. Although  had no effect on glucose transport (2-deoxyglucose uptake) in the epitrochlearis muscle, which consists mainly of type IIb fibers, acute angiotensin II receptor antagonism led to a dose-dependent increase in insulin action in the predominantly type I soleus muscle.  at 25 and 50 mg/kg induced significant increases (41% and 50%, respectively; P<0.05) in insulin-mediated glucose transport. Moreover, these acute -induced improvements in soleus-muscle glucose transport were associated with enhancements in whole-body insulin sensitivity (r=-0.732; P<0.05), as assessed during an oral glucose tolerance test. After chronic administration of  (21 days at 50 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), glucose tolerance was enhanced further, and insulin-mediated glucose transport was significantly elevated in both epitrochlearis (32%) and soleus (73%) muscle. Chronic angiotensin II receptor antagonism was associated with significant increases in glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4) protein expression in soleus (22%) and plantaris (20%) muscle and myocardium (15%). Chronic -induced increases in whole-body insulin sensitivity were associated with increased insulin-mediated glucose transport in both epitrochlearis (r=-0.677; P<0.05) and soleus (r=-0.892; P<0.05) muscle. In summary, angiotensin II receptor (AT(1)-subtype) antagonism, either acutely or chronically, improves glucose tolerance, at least in part because of an enhancement in skeletal-muscle glucose transport, and the effect of chronic angiotensin II receptor antagonism on type I skeletal-muscle glucose uptake is associated with an increase in GLUT-4 protein expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16877964> restores the in-vivo insulin signaling pathway leading to Akt activation in obese Zucker rats.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin II (AII) has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension and insulin resistance.
