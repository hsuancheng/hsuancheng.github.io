Thus far, the pathways and key genes related to oil biosynthesis in developing pecan seeds remain largely unclear. Our analyses revealed that mature pecan embryo accumulated more than 80% oil, in which 90% was unsaturated fatty acids with abundant oleic . RNA sequencing generated 84,643 unigenes in three cDNA libraries prepared from pecan embryos collected at 105, 120, and 165 days after flowering (DAF). We identified 153 unigenes associated with lipid biosynthesis, including 107 unigenes for fatty  biosynthesis, 34 for triacylglycerol biosynthesis, 7 for oil bodies, and 5 for transcription factors involved in oil synthesis. The genes associated with fatty  synthesis were the most abundantly expressed genes at 120 DAF. Additionally, the biosynthesis of oil began to increase while crude fat contents increased from 16.61 to 74.45% (165 DAF). We identified four SAD, two FAD2, one FAD6, two FAD7, and two FAD8 unigenes responsible for unsaturated fatty  biosynthesis. However, FAD3 homologues were not detected. Consequently, we inferred that the  in developing pecan embryos is generated by FAD7 and FAD8 in plastids rather than FAD3 in endoplasmic reticula. During pecan embryo development, different unigenes are expressed for plastidial and cytosolic . Plastidial  is more relevant to lipid synthesis than cytosolic . The 18 most important genes associated with lipid biosynthesis were evaluated in five stages of developing embryos using quantitative PCR (qPCR). The qPCR data were well consistent with their expression in transcriptomic analyses. Our data would be important for the metabolic engineering of pecans to increase oil contents and modify fatty  composition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28129739>iTRAQ-based Protein Profiling and Fruit Quality Changes at Different Development Stages of Oriental Melon.</a></h1><p>Oriental melon is one of the most popular crops for its nutritional and flavour quality. Components that determine melon quality, such as sugar, colour, texture, flavour and aroma, among other factors, accumulate in different developmental stages. Thus, correlating the proteomic profiles with the biochemical and physiological changes occurring in the oriental melon is very important for advancing our understanding of oriental melon quality in the ripening processes.iTRAQ-based protein profiling was conducted on 'YuMeiren' oriental melon fruit at different developmental stages. Physiological quality indices, including firmness, rind colour, soluble solids content (SSC), ethylene production, sugar content and volatile compounds were also characterized during four maturity periods of the melon, including 5, 15, 25 and 35 days after anthesis (DAA). A principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the aroma volatiles at 5 DAA and 15 DAA were similar and separated from that of 35 DAA. More than 5835 proteins were identified and quantified in the two biological repeats and divided into 4 clusters by hierarchical cluster analysis. A functional analysis was performed using Blast2GO software based on the enrichment of a GO analysis for biological process, molecular function and cellular components. The main KEGG pathways, such as , α- and starch and sucrose metabolism, were analyzed. The gene family members corresponding to differentially expressed proteins, including lipoxygenase (CmLOX01-18) and alcohol acetyltransferase (CmAAT1-4) involved in the α- metabolic pathway, were verified with real-time qPCR. The results showed that the expression patterns of 64.7% of the genes were consistent with the expression patterns of the corresponding proteins.This study combined the variation of the quality index and differentially expressed proteins of oriental melon at different developmental stages that laid the foundation for the subsequent protein and gene function validation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30036858>Transcriptome analysis reveals the effects of grafting on sugar and α- metabolisms in fruits of cucumber with two different rootstocks.</a></h1><p>Flavor quality in cucumber is affected by different rootstocks, but the molecular mechanism is largely unclean. To clarify the differences of sugar and aromatic compounds, cucumber (cucumis sativus) fruits from plants of self-grafted (SG) or grafted onto figleaf gourd (Cucurbita ficifolia; G1) or 'Weisheng No.1' rootstock (Cucurbita moschata ⅹCucurbita moschata hybrids; G2) were performed the transcriptome analysis. We obtained 1013 and 920 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from G1 and G2 compared to SG respectively, in which 453 genes were co-expressed. Functional annotations showed many DEGs were involved in /gluconeogenesis metabolism, fructose metabolism and α- metabolisms, 20 DEGs were selected from the 3 pathways to validate sequencing accuracy by quantitative real-time PCR. The gene relative expression levels were concurrent with RNA-seq results and sugar and aromatic compounds content phenotypes. Moreover, some vital transcript factors and transport proteins were analyzed. These findings indicate that different rootstocks could induce significantly changes in the physiological profiling and transcripts of sugar- and aromatic flavor-related genes. This study provides a novel insight into the molecular mechanisms of fruit quality regulated by candidate genes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, whether LqhIT2 induces insect resistance in rice, and how the LqhIT2 influences the biochemical metabolism of rice plants remains unknown. Here, purified LqhIT2-GST fusion protein had toxicity to rice leafrollers. Meanwhile, in vitro and field trials showed that LqhIT2 transgenic rice plants were less damaged by rice leafrollers compared to the wild type plants. Introducing LqhIT2 primed the elevated expression of lipoxygenase, a key component of the jasmonic  biosynthetic pathway, together with enhanced , cis-(+)-12-oxophytodienoic , jasmonic , and jasmonic -isoleucine levels. In addition, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, a key gene of the phenylpropanoid pathway, was up-regulated. Correspondingly, the contents of downstream products of the phenylpropanoid pathway such as flavonoids and lignins, were also increased in LqhIT2 transgenic plants. These changes were paralleled by decreased starch, glucose, and glucose-6-phosphate accumulation, the key metabolites of  pathway that supplies the raw material and intermediate carbon products for phenylpropanoids biosyntheses. These findings suggest that, in addition to its own toxicity against pests, LqhIT2 activate the phenylpropanoid pathway via jasmonate-mediated priming, which subsequently increases flavonoid and lignin content and improves insect resistance in rice.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Foc is a soil borne pathogen that causes rot of the roots or wilt of leaves by colonizing the xylem vessels. The dual RNA sequencing is used to simultaneously assess the transcriptomes of pathogen and host. This method greatly helps to understand the responses of pathogen and host to each other and discover the potential pathogenic mechanism.Plantlets of two economically important banana cultivars, Foc TR4 less susceptible cultivar NK and susceptible cultivar BX, were used to research the Foc-banana interaction mechanism. Notably, the infected NK had more significantly up-regulated genes on the respiration machinery including TCA cycle, glyoxylate, glycerol, and  compared to BX at 27 h post inoculation (hpi). In addition, genes involved in plant-pathogen interaction, starch, sucrose,  and sphingolipid metabolisms were uniquely more greatly induced in BX than those in NK during the whole infection. Genes related to the biosynthesis and metabolism of SA and JA were greatly induced in the infected NK; while auxin and abscisic  metabolisms related genes were strongly stimulated in the infected BX at 27 hpi. Furthermore, most of fungal genes were more highly expressed in the roots of BX than in those of NK. The fungal genes related to pathogenicity, pectin and chitin metabolism, reactive oxygen scavenging played the important roles during the infection of Foc. CCP1 (cytochrome c peroxidase 1) was verified to involve in cellulose utilization, oxidative stress response and pathogenicity of fungus.The transcriptome indicated that NK had much faster defense response against Foc TR4 than BX and the expression levels of fungal genes were higher in BX than those in NK. The metabolisms of carbon, nitrogen, and signal transduction molecular were differentially involved in pathogen infection in BX and NK. Additionally, the putative virulence associated fungal genes involved in colonization, nutrition acquirement and transport provided more insights into the infection process of Foc TR4 in banana roots.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27813582>Genome-wide expression analysis of a rice mutant line under salt stress.</a></h1><p>Salinity is a major environmental stress to plants. In this study, the ability of plants to tolerate salt was investigated by studying growth, physiological characteristics, and expression levels of genes related to the salt-stress response in the salt-tolerant rice mutant (Till-II-877), which was derived from γ-ray irradiation. Compared to plants grown under normal conditions, the height and root length of wild type (WT) were reduced by approximately 40 and 29% following exposure to salt stress for 3 weeks, whereas Till-II-877 line showed 29 and 23% reductions in plant height and root length, respectively. No significant changes were observed in total chlorophyll content, and the malondialdehyde content of the mutant increased less than that of the WT under salt treatment. Gene expression was compared between the WT and mutant lines using microarray analysis. An unbiased analysis of the gene expression datasets allowed us to identify the pathways involved in salt-stress responses. Among the most significantly affected pathways, changes in gene expression were observed in α- and linoleic  metabolism (in lipid metabolism), fructose and mannose metabolism and glycolysis-gluconeogenesis (in carbohydrate metabolism), cysteine and methionine metabolism (in amino  metabolism), and carbon fixation (in the  metabolism of photosynthetic organisms) under salt stress. These results show that the differential response of plants subjected to salt stress was due to changes in multiple metabolic pathways. These findings increase our understanding of the effects of salt stress in rice and may aid in the development of salt-tolerant rice cultivars.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30364271>Proteomic Analysis of the Hepatopancreas of Chinese Mitten Crabs () Fed With a Linoleic  or α- Diet.</a></h1><p>As representatives of n-6 and n-3 fatty acids, many studies have analyzed the use of soybean oil and linseed oil rich in linoleic  (18:2n-6, LA) and α- (18:3n-3, LNA) as better substitutes for fish oil. In aquatic animals, different dietary ratios of LA and LNA could have significant effects on growth, lipid metabolism, immune response, and reproduction. To assess the nutritive value of these two fatty acids in Chinese mitten crab (), we performed transcriptome analysis and label-free quantification proteomic analysis of the hepatopancreas from mitten crabs fed with LA or LNA diet. Parallel reaction monitoring was used to confirm the reliability of the proteomic analysis. A total of 186 proteins were differentially expressed with fold change ≥1.5 or ≤0.666. Among the 186 proteins, 116 were upregulated and 70 were downregulated in the LA than LNA. Most of these proteins participate in cellular process and metabolism process and have molecular functions such as binding and catalytic activity; the cellular component of these proteins are cell, cell part, membrane, and membrane part. A total of 18 proteins were identified to be related to lipid, carbohydrate, and protein metabolism, and they mainly participate in digestive enzyme activities, fatty  transport, and . Our results provide new insights for further investigation into the replacement of fish oil from mitten crabs with vegetable oils and enable us to better understand the different roles and nutrition value of LA and LNA in mitten crabs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25311060>Disparate metabolic effects of blackcurrant seed oil in rats fed a basal and obesogenic diet.</a></h1><p>It was hypothesised that blackcurrant seed oil beneficially modulates metabolic disorders related to obesity and its complications. The study also aimed to investigate the potentially adverse effects of an unbalanced diet on the distal intestine.Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to four groups of eight animals each and were fed a basal or obesogenic (high in fat and low in fibre) diet that contained either rapeseed oil (Canola) or blackcurrant seed oil. A two-way analysis of variance was then applied to assess the effects of diet and oil and the interaction between them.After 8 weeks, the obesogenic dietary regimen increased the body weight, altered the plasma lipid profile and increased the liver fat content and the plasma transaminase activities. In addition, the obesogenic diet decreased bacterial glycolytic activity and short-chain fatty  formation in the distal intestine. Dietary blackcurrant seed oil improved the lipid metabolism by lowering liver fat accumulation and the plasma triglyceride concentration and atherogenicity as well by increasing the plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration. However, in rats fed an obesogenic diet containing blackcurrant seed oil, the plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration was comparable with both rapeseed oil-containing diets, and a significant elevation of the plasma transaminase activities was noted instead.The obesogenic dietary regimen causes a number of metabolic disorders, including alterations in the hindgut microbial metabolism. Dietary blackcurrant seed oil ameliorates the lipid metabolism; however, the beneficial effect is restricted when it is provided together with the obesogenic diet, and a risk of liver injury may occur.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29902680>Oil biosynthesis and transcriptome profiles in developing endosperm and oil characteristic analyses in Paeonia ostii var. lishizhenii.</a></h1><p>Paeonia ostii var. lishizhenii, a well-known medicinal and horticultural plant, is indigenous to China. Recent studies have shown that its seed has a high oil content, and it was approved as a novel resource of edible oil with a high level of α- by the Chinese Government. This study measured the seed oil contents and fatty  components of P. ostii var. lishizhenii and six other peonies, P. suffruticosa, P. ludlowii, P. decomposita, P. rockii, and P. lactiflora Pall. 'Heze' and 'Gansu'. The results show that P. ostii var. lishizhenii exhibits the average oil characteristics of tested peonies, with an oil content of 21.3%, α- 43.8%, and unsaturated fatty acids around 92.1%. Hygiene indicators for the seven peony seed oils met the Chinese national food standards. P. ostii var. lishizhenii seeds were used to analyze transcriptome gene regulation networks on endosperm development and oil biosynthesis. In total, 124,117 transcripts were obtained from six endosperm developing stages (S0-S5). The significant changes in differential expression genes (DEGs) clarify three peony endosperm developmental phases: the endosperm cell mitotic phase (S0-S1), the TAG biosynthesis phase (S1-S4), and the mature phase (S5). The DEGs in plant hormone signal transduction, DNA replication, cell division, differentiation, transcription factors, and seed dormancy pathways regulate the endosperm development process. Another 199 functional DEGs participate in , pentose phosphate pathway, citrate cycle, FA biosynthesis, TAG assembly, and other pathways. A key transcription factor (WRI1) and some important target genes (ACCase, FATA, LPCAT, FADs, and DGAT etc.) were found in the comprehensive genetic networks of oil biosynthesis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

Glycolysis provides both cellular  and the intermediates for other biosynthetic processes. However, nothing was known about the molecular basis of the glycolytic pathway in E. ulmoides kernels. The purposes of this study were to identify novel genes of E. ulmoides related to glycolytic metabolism and to analyze the expression patterns of selected genes in the kernels. Transcriptome sequencing based on the Illumina platform generated 96,469 unigenes in four cDNA libraries constructed using RNAs from 70 and 160 days after flowering kernels of both low- and high-ALA varieties. We identified and characterized the digital expression of 120 unigenes coding for 24 protein families involved in kernel glycolytic pathway. The expression levels of glycolytic genes were generally higher in younger kernels than in more mature kernels. Importantly, several unigenes from kernels of the high-ALA variety were expressed more than those from the low-ALA variety. The expression of 10 unigenes encoding key enzymes in the glycolytic pathway was validated by qPCR using RNAs from six kernel stages of each variety. The qPCR data were well consistent with their digital expression in transcriptomic analyses. This study identified a comprehensive set of genes for glycolytic metabolism and suggests that several glycolytic genes may play key roles in ALA accumulation in the kernels of E. ulmoides.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27851826>Transcriptional Responses and Gentiopicroside Biosynthesis in Methyl Jasmonate-Treated Gentiana macrophylla Seedlings.</a></h1><p>Gentiana macrophylla, a medicinal plant with significant pharmacological properties, contains the bioactive compound gentiopicroside. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is an effective elicitor for enhancing the production of such compounds. However, little is known about MeJA-mediated biosynthesis of gentiopicroside. We investigated this phenomenon as well as gene expression profiles to determine the molecular mechanisms for MeJA-mediated gentiopicroside biosynthesis and regulation in G. macrophylla. Our HPLC results showed that Gentiana macrophylla seedlings exposed to MeJA had significantly higher concentrations of gentiopicroside when compared with control plants. We used RNA sequencing to compare transcriptional profiles in seedlings treated for 5 d with either 0 μmol L-1 MeJA (C) or 250 μmol L-1 MeJA (M5) and detected differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In total, 77,482 unique sequences were obtained from approximately 34 million reads. Of these, 48,466 (57.46%) sequences were annotated based on BLASTs performed against public databases. We identified 5,206 DEGs between the C and M5 samples, including genes related to the α-lenolenic  degradation pathway, JA signaling pathway, and gentiopicroside biosynthesis. Expression of numerous enzyme genes in the  pathway was significantly up-regulated. Many genes encoding transcription factors (e.g. ERF, bHLH, MYB, and WRKY) also responded to MeJA elicitation. Rapid acceleration of the  pathway that supplies precursors for IPP biosynthesis and up-regulates the expression of enzyme genes in that IPP pathway are probably most responsible for MeJA stimulation of gentiopicroside synthesis. Our qRT-PCR results showed that the expression profiles of 12 gentiopicroside biosynthesis genes were consistent with the RNA-Seq data. These results increase our understanding about how the gentiopicroside biosynthesis pathway in G. macrophylla responds to MeJA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28727036>Supplementation of glycerol or fructose via drinking water to grazing lambs on tissue glycogen level and lipogenesis.</a></h1><p>Lambs ( = 18; 40.1 ± 7.4 kg BW) were used to assess supplementation of glycerol or fructose via drinking water on growth, tissue glycogen levels, postmortem , and lipogenesis. Lambs were blocked by BW and allocated to alfalfa paddocks (2 lambs/paddock and 3 paddocks/treatment). Each paddock within a block was assigned randomly to drinking water treatments for 30 d: 1) control (CON), 2) 120 g fructose/L of drinking water (FRU), or 3) 120 g glycerol/L of drinking water (GLY). Lambs grazed alfalfa with free access to water treatments for 28 d and then were fasted in indoor pens for a final 2 d with access to only water treatments. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS with water treatment and time (when appropriate) in the model. During the 28-d grazing period, ADG was greater ( < 0.05) for GLY than for CON or FRU. During the 2-d fasting period, BW shrink was lower ( < 0.05) for GLY compared with CON or FRU. Hot carcass weight was greater ( < 0.05) for GLY than for FRU. The interaction for glycogen content × postmortem time was significant ( = 0.003) in LM and semitendinosus (ST) muscles. Glycogen content in the LM was greater ( < 0.05) for GLY at 2 and 3 h and for FRU at 1 h postmortem compared with CON. Glycogen content in ST did not differ between treatments ( > 0.05). Liver glycogen content was over 14-fold greater ( < 0.05) for GLY compared with FRU or CON. Liver free glucose was greater ( < 0.05) for GLY than for CON, whereas liver lipid content was higher ( < 0.05) for CON than for GLY. Supplementation with GLY increased ( < 0.05) odd-chain fatty acids in LM, subcutaneous fat (SQ), and the liver. Stearic  (C18:0) concentrations were reduced in LM ( = 0.064) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SQ; = 0.018), whereas oleic  (C18:1 -9) concentration tended to be increased ( = 0.066) in SQ with FRU and GLY.  (C18:3 -3) was reduced ( = 0.031) and all long-chain -3 fatty  (eicosapentaenoic , docosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic ) concentrations were increased ( < 0.05) with FRU and GLY compared with CON. Glycerol supplementation upregulated ( < 0.05) stearoyl-CoA desaturate () and fatty  synthase () mRNA by over 40-fold in the SQ and 5-fold in the liver. Glycerol supplementation also upregulated ( < 0.05) glucose transporters and glycogen branching enzyme in the liver. Overall, glycerol supplementation improved growth, reduced BW shrink during fasting, increased glycogen content in muscle and the liver, and stimulated de novo lipogenesis.</p></html>
