Therefore, new therapeutic interventions are needed to increase the immunogenicity of tumors and overcome the resistance to these immunotherapies. Oncolytic properties of common viruses can be exploited for the priming of antitumor immunity, and such oncolytic viruses are currently in active clinical development in combination with immune checkpoint-targeted therapies. However, the routine implementation of these therapies is limited by their manufacturing constraints, the risk of exposure of clinical staff, and the ongoing regulations on genetically modified organisms. We sought to determine whether anti-infectious disease vaccines could be used as a commercially available source of immunostimulatory agents for cancer . We found that rotavirus vaccines have both immunostimulatory and oncolytic properties. In vitro, they can directly kill cancer cells with features of immunogenic cell death. In vivo, intratumoral rotavirus therapy has antitumor effects that are dependent on the immune system. In several immunocompetent murine tumor models, intratumoral rotavirus overcomes resistance to and synergizes with immune checkpoint-targeted therapy. Heat- and UV-inactivated rotavirus lost their oncolytic activity but kept their synergy with immune checkpoint-targeted antibodies through the up-regulation of the double-stranded RNA receptor retinoic acid-induced gene 1 (RIG-I). Rotavirus vaccines are clinical-grade products used in pediatric and adult populations. Therefore, in situ immunization strategies with intratumoral-attenuated rotavirus could be implemented quickly in the clinic.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Conventional subcutaneous  (SCIT) and sublingual  (SLIT) cannot meet patients' needs owing to the side effects caused by both the use of conventional whole antigen molecules in the pollen extract and the administration routes. To address these issues, a surface-modified antigen and transcutaneous administration route are introduced in this research. First, the pollen extract (PE) was conjugated to galactomannan (PE-GM) to mask immunoglobulin E (IgE)-binding epitopes in the PE to avoid side effects. Second, as a safer alternative to SCIT and SLIT, transcutaneous  (TCIT) with a solid-in-oil (S/O) nanodispersion system carrying PE-GM was proposed. Hydrophilic PE-GM was efficiently delivered through mouse skin using S/O nanodispersions, reducing the antibody secretion and modifying the type 1 T helper (Th1)/ type 2 T helper (Th2) balance in the mouse model, thereby demonstrating the potential to alleviate Japanese cedar pollinosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648957>Recent Advances in CAR-T Cell Therapy for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.</a></h2><p>Adoptive cellular  with anti CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell has changed the treatment landscape in relapsed/refractory B cell lymphomas. They have emerged as effective therapy in patients with multiple relapsed/refractory disease, capable of sustaining durable remissions.

CAR-T cell-related toxicities, including infections, cytokine release syndrome, and neurotoxicity are potential complications of therapy. With increasing use of CAR-T cells, the mechanism of toxicities and mitigation strategies needs to be developed. Additionally, reasons for CAR-T cell failure and progression following this therapy needs to be further studied.

This was followed by major advances in passive  75 years ago (production of pooled human IgG for subcutaneous injection) and 50 years ago (widespread technology for producing immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous administration). More than 200 tons of pooled human IgG are produced per year worldwide. The preparation is used primarily for IgG substitution in patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, as well as for an immunomodulating treatment of a growing number of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. These preparations contain the pooled IgG antibody repertoire of a large population of healthy plasma donors. This repertoire includes antibodies that neutralize pathogens and their factors of virulence, anti-idiotypic antibodies, and antibodies to other foreign and own proteins, as well as to carbohydrate antigens. Naturally polyspecific antibodies that are present in all healthy individuals play an important role as a first-line defense against bacteria and viruses. After exposure to protein-modifying agents, some IgG molecules can acquire the ability to bind novel structurally unrelated antigens. This phenomenon is referred to as induced polyspecificity. The list of these protein-modifying molecules was shown to include low-pH buffers, free heme, pro-oxidative ferrous ions, reactive oxygen species, etc. Such modified antibody preparations may have a therapeutic potential, since their administration to animals with experimental sepsis or aseptic systemic response syndromes significantly improved survival rates, while the same dose of the native preparation had no effect. We also hypothesize that the aggressive protein-modifying molecules released in sites of inflammation and tissue damage could also modify the antigen-binding behavior of surface immunoglobulin B cell receptors and the structurally related T cell receptors. This "specificity editing" of both types of receptors may play a major role in the body's defense mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649889>Vitiligo Adverse Event Observed in a Patient With Durable Complete Response After Nivolumab for Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.</a></h2><p> Renal cell carcinoma is the third most prevalent urological cancer worldwide and about 30% of patients present with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Systemic treatments for metastatic renal cell carcinoma have improved recently. Vascular endothelial growth factor targeting therapies were the previous standard of care. However, immune checkpoint inhibitors used in second line therapy have now been shown to improve patient survival. We report a case of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with nivolumab as a second-line therapy after progression with tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Unusual adverse events in metastatic renal cell carcinoma, such as vitiligo, were observed in this patient who developed a remarkable documented pathological complete response to his renal tumor.  A 60-year-old caucasian male was diagnosed with a pulmonary metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Sunitinib was used as first line treatment without success. He received nivolumab in second-line treatment. He developed several immune-related adverse events, most notably vitiligo. The patient had a radiological complete response on metastatic sites, with a significant decrease of renal tumor volume and underwent cytoreductive nephrectomy after 2 years of treatment, confirming the pathological complete response. The patient remains disease-free for 10 months without further systemic therapy after nivolumab discontinuation.  Pathological complete response with nivolumab in metastatic renal cell carcinoma is rare. This case further highlights the potentially predictive role of immune-related adverse events during nivolumab therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma and raises questions concerning the role of nephrectomy after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Further studies are needed to better identify predictive factors for treatment response to  in metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and to better understand the role of nephrectomy after nivolumab treatment.Copyright © 2019 Billon, Walz, Brunelle, Thomassin, Salem, Guerin, Vicier, Dermeche, Albiges, Tantot, Nenan, Pignot and Gravis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659324>The impact of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay on genetic disease, gene editing and cancer .</a></h2><p>Premature termination codons (PTCs) can result in the production of truncated proteins or the degradation of messenger RNAs by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Which of these outcomes occurs can alter the effect of a mutation, with the engagement of NMD being dependent on a series of rules. Here, by applying these rules genome-wide to obtain a resource called NMDetective, we explore the impact of NMD on genetic disease and approaches to therapy. First, human genetic diseases differ in whether NMD typically aggravates or alleviates the effects of PTCs. Second, failure to trigger NMD is a cause of ineffective gene inactivation by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. Finally, NMD is a determinant of the efficacy of cancer , with only frameshifted transcripts that escape NMD predicting a response. These results demonstrate the importance of incorporating the rules of NMD into clinical decision-making.

The management of recurrences remains unsettled and may entail repeat SBRT, conventionally fractionated external beam RT (EF-EBRT), chemotherapy or surgery. Most patients with local recurrences [within the initial planning target volume (PTV)] can be salvaged successfully with good cancer specific survival. Nonetheless, proximity of the initial SBRT delivery to organs at risk (ribs, blood vessels, airways) may make retreatment more difficult. With attention to detail and careful patient selection, both surgery and reirradiation can be performed safely and effectively. Strategies for management of regional (nodal) recurrences may require conventional therapies tailored to the patterns of failure. The role of  in salvage has not been elucidated as yet.

We performed capture-based targeted sequencing on tissue samples collected from 27 patients with sufficient samples using a panel consisting of 520 cancer-related genes, spanning 1.64 Mb of the human genome. We identified 184 somatic mutations in 109 genes from 26 patients. One patient had no mutations detected by this panel. Copy number variations were detected in 52% (14/27) of the patients, with a majority having advanced-stage disease (10/14). Except for the detection of ERBB2 amplification and KRAS mutation in two patients, no other classic lung cancer driver mutations were detected. Interestingly, 78% (21/27) of the patients had mutations in epigenetic regulators. Of the 184 mutations identified, 51 occurred in 29 epigenetics-related genes. Furthermore, we performed PD-L1 immunohistochemistry staining using the Dako 22C3 assay and demonstrated that 69% (20/29) of the cohort had positive PD-L1 expression, of which three patients received and benefited from a PD-1 inhibitor. In conclusion, we elucidated a distinct genomic landscape associated with pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma with no classic lung cancer driver mutation but an enrichment of mutations in epigenetic regulators. The detection of high PD-L1 expression and lack of any canonical druggable driver mutations raises the potential of checkpoint  for pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672770>Pan-Tumor Pathologic Scoring of Response to PD-(L)1 Blockade.</a></h2><p>Pathologic response assessment of tumor specimens from patients receiving systemic treatment provide an early indication of therapeutic efficacy and predict long-term survival.

Although cancer cells contain supra-normal concentrations of cytoplasmic DNA, they rarely produce type I IFN spontaneously. This suggests that defects in the DNA-sensing pathway may serve as an immune escape mechanism. We find that cancer cells produce cGAMP that is transferred via gap junctions to tumor-associated dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, which respond by producing type I IFN in situ. Cancer-cell-intrinsic expression of cGAS, but not STING, promotes infiltration by effector CD8 T cells and consequently results in prolonged survival. Furthermore, cGAS-expressing cancers respond better to genotoxic treatments and . Thus, cancer-cell-derived cGAMP is crucial to protective anti-tumor CD8 T cell immunity. Consequently, cancer-cell-intrinsic expression of cGAS determines tumor immunogenicity and makes tumors hot.

Until 2006, non-specific  with high dose interleukin-2 (HD IL-2) was considered as standard therapy of mccRCC. The transition from cytokine to targeted therapy, and now to novel immunotherapeutic agents, significantly increased the overall survival (OS) of patients with mccRCC. Currently, 7 targeted agents and the combination of nivolumab/ipilimumab (immune checkpoint inhibitors, ICIs) have been approved as first-line therapy for mccRCC. Based on evidence from randomized phase III clinical trials, sunitinib and pazopanib (Tyrosine kinase inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGF-TKIs) are the most effective first-line options, especially in favorable and indermediate risk patients. Nivolumab/ipilimumab (dual checkpoint inhibitors) seem to be the preferred first-line therapy in poor-risk patients, although cabozantinib, temsirolimus, sunitinib and pazopanib are also recommended. HD IL-2 remains a reasonable first-line treatment option in selected, favorable-risk younger patients with good performance status.

Donor-specific antibodies (DSA) are putatively associated with a worse prognosis for recipient and graft after liver transplantation.To assess the immune regulation in subTCMR grafts, gene expression of 93 transcripts for graft injury, tolerance and immune regulation was analyzed in 77 biopsies with "no histological rejection" (NHR; n=25), "clinical TCMR" (cTMCR; n=16) and subTCMR (n=36). In addition, all available subTCMR biopsies (n=71) were tested for DSA with bead assays.SubTCMR showed heterogeneous and intermediate expression profiles of transcripts that were upregulated in cTCMR. Graft gene expression suggested a lower activation of effector lymphocytes and a higher activation of regulatory T cells in grafts with subTCMR compared to cTCMR.DSA positivity in subTCMR was associated with histological evidence of more severe graft inflammation and fibrosis. This more severe DSA+ associated graft injury in subTCMR was converged with an upregulation of cTCMR associated transcripts. In nonsupervised analysis DSA positive subTCMR mostly clustered together with cTCMR, while DSA negative subTCMR clustered together with NHR.T cell-mediated rejection seem to form a continuum of alloimmune activation. Although subTCMR exhibited less expression of TCMR associated transcript, DSA positivity in subTCMR was associated with an upregulation of rejection associated transcripts. The identification of DSA positive subclinical rejection might help to define patients with more inflammation in the graft and development of fibrosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653434> in the management of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.</a></h2><p>Despite many advances in surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic treatments, only modest improvements in survival, function, and quality of life have been achieved after treatment of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck. With a better understanding of the biology and genetics of tumours, the emergence of a paradigm shift towards the further development of non-surgical treatments may result in less morbidity and better outcomes than are seen currently. SCC of the head and neck is known to be a complex disease that has a sophisticated interaction with the human immune system. At the forefront of emerging treatments is , which has already been established in many other areas of oncology. The rapidly evolving nature of immunotherapeutic agents and, sometimes, their complex mechanisms can make the understanding of these concepts challenging, and could discourage clinicians from engaging in clinical trials. The aim of this paper therefore was to review the current premise for immunotherapeutic approaches, and to provide a contemporary evidence-based rationale for their use.Copyright © 2019 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

However, suppressive factors, such as regulatory T cells (Tregs), may be obstacles in the use of NKT cell-based cancer  for advanced cancer patients. Here, we investigated the suppressive effects of Tregs on NKT cells and the underlying mechanisms with the aim to improve the antitumor activities of NKT cells.Peripheral blood samples were obtained from healthy donors, patients with benign tumors, and patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). NKT cells, induced with α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) were co-cultured with naïve CD4 T cell-derived Tregs to investigate the mechanism of the Treg suppressive effect on NKT cell cytotoxic function. The functions and phenotypes of NKT cells were evaluated with flow cytometry and cytometric bead array.Treg suppression on NKT cell function required cell-to-cell contact and was mediated via impaired DC maturation. NKT cells cultured under Treg-enriched conditions showed a decrease in CD4 NKT cell frequency, which exert strong tumoricidal responsiveness upon α-GalCer stimulation. The same results were observed in HNSCC patients with significantly increased effector Tregs.Tregs exert suppressive effects on NKT cell tumoricidal function by inducing more CD4 NKT cell anergy and less CD4 NKT cell anergy. Both Treg depletion and NKT cell recovery from the anergy state may be important for improving the clinical efficacy of NKT cell-based  in patients with advanced cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669192>Antagonistic role of IL-1ß and NLRP3/IL-18 genetics in chronic HIV-1 infection.</a></h2><p>Host genetics affects both susceptibility and progression of HIV-1 infection. NLRP3 inflammasome provides a first-line defense in viral infections, and, accordingly, gain-of-function variants in NLRP3 have been associated with protection against HIV-1. Despite antiretroviral treatment (ART), HIV+ patients continue to present systemic inflammation with a heterogeneous prognosis. As NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in several chronic diseases by amplifying "sterile" inflammation, its role in chronic phase of HIV infection has been postulated. Little is known about inflammasome genetics in HIV+ patients and whether it may play a role in the different clinical outcomes. Therefore, we questioned whether NLRP3 inflammasome genetics could affect the clinical course of HIV-1 infection as it does in host/virus interaction. For this purpose, we analyzed selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ART-treated HIV+ patients (n = 300), in Long Term Non-Progressors/Elite Controllers and progressors (n = 133), and in HIV+ individuals submitted to dendritic cell (DC)-based  (n = 19). SNPs leading to increased activation of NLRP3 inflammasome are beneficial for patients, while SNPs that negatively affect NLRP3 activation or IL-18 production, detrimental. In contrast, gain-of-function variant in IL1B is also detrimental for patients, suggesting that while IL-1ß possible contributes to immune exhaustion, the axis NLRP3-inflammasome/IL-18 could act positively in chronic infection. Functional assays supported genetic results: NLRP3 variants associated with good quality HIV+ DC, and IL1B -511C > T with a poor one. Loss-of-function SNPs affect HIV+ T cells proliferation. These findings proposed for the first time that NLRP3 inflammasome, mainly through IL-18, play a protective role in chronic HIV infection.Copyright © 2018.

A variety of factors such as maturation state of DCs, co-stimulatory signals, T-cell microenvironment, antigen internalization routes and adjuvants regulate the process of DC-mediated antigen cross-presentation. Recently, the development of successful cancer immunotherapies may be attributed to the ability of DCs to cross-present tumor antigens. In this review article, we focus on the underlying mechanism of antigen cross-presentation and ways to improve antigen cross-presentation in different DC subsets. We have critically summarized the recent developments in the generation of novel nanovaccines for robust CD8+ T-cell response in cancer. In this context, we have reviewed nanocarriers that have been used for cancer immunotherapeutics based on antigen cross-presentation mechanism.

We first describe an ultracentrifugation technique to isolate MVs from the conditioned cell culture media of MSCs. Next, we describe characterization and quality control steps to analyze the protein and RNA content of MVs. Finally, we examined the potential of MVs to exert immunomodulatory effects through induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs).

IL-15 delivers its signal through different modes involving three receptor chains: IL-15Rα, IL-2Rβ and γc. The combination of the different chains result in the formation of IL-15Rα/IL-2Rβ/γc trimeric or IL-2Rβ/γc dimeric receptors. In this study, we aimed at investigating the role of IL-15Rα chain in stabilizing the cytokine in the IL-2Rβ/γc dimeric receptor. By analyzing the key residues of IL-15 facing IL-2Rβ, we provided evidence of differential interfaces in the presence or in the absence of membrane-anchored IL-15Rα. Moreover, we found that the anchorage of IL-15Rα to the cell surface regardless its mode of presentation, in  or in , is crucial for complete signaling. These observations show how the cells can finely modulate the intensity of cytokine signaling through the quality and the level of expression of the receptor chains.© 2019.

Use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer has coincided with the onset of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). irAEs are caused by a break in host self-tolerance, which can be deadly. Acute management of irAEs is complicated by difficulty making a prompt clinical diagnosis. The goal is to maximize anticancer benefit while minimizing irAE risk.

Four cancer types exhibited a significant and positive correlation of immune response with patient age. Significant but inconsistent correlation of immune response was observed with gender, surgical stage, and TNM stage in a small number of cancer types. In contrast, the histological grade appears to have much stronger and more consistent association with immune response as compared to the other clinicopathologic factors.

About 90% of all renal cancers are Renal Cell Carcinoma. Most cases are diagnosed incidentally. 17% of cases are advanced at the time of diagnosis. PDL1 being a trans-membrane cell surface protein is expressed on the tumor cells and is found to have a chief role to inhibit the T cell immune response. It is essential to improve the host immunity by targeting the PD1/PDL1 pathway, thereby destroying the tumor progression.The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of PDL1 in tumor cells and adjacent normal tissue among the renal cell carcinoma patients and assess the relation between the PDL1 expression and the tumor characters.This is a retrospective study. Ethical clearance was obtained from the institution. 150 histopathologically proven RCC cases were chosen. Immunohistochemistry using a PD-L1 rabbit monoclonal antibody was performed on paraffin embedded formalin fixed tissue blocks. Q scoring was done to calculate the expression of PDL1.Chi square test was done to assess the comparison between the PDL1 expression in tumor cells and their characteristic features like histology, grade and stage. SPSS (version 20.0) was used for analysis. P value <0.05 was considered significant.

Significant association was observed between high WWHO ISUP grading and positive PDL1 expression (p=0.028). It was expressed in 75% of the sarcomatous type of RCC and 46.8% of clear cell RCCs.Our study suggests that blocking PD1/PDL1 pathway may become an effective mode of treatment in cancer  especially for Renal Cell Carcinomas.

Functional TCR subunit genes are formed by somatic rearrangement, and some of the resulting TCRs recognize autoantigens, the body's own molecules. The autoreactive T cells that carry such TCRs pose a threat of inducing immune reactions against their own organism. In the course of the immune system's development, some autoreactive T lymphocytes are eliminated by apoptosis, some differentiate into immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, which support immunological tolerance to autoantigens, and the rest fall into a non-functional state of anergy. Suppression of effector T cells by regulatory T cells is mediated by immunosuppressive cytokines and costimulatory molecules, depletion of stimulating IL-2, removal of autoreactive peptides together with MHC molecules, and in other ways.

A mechanism that Neisseria gonorrhoeae uses to evade complement attack is binding of the complement inhibitor C4b-binding protein (C4BP). We screened 107 PorB1a and 83 PorB1b clinical isolates randomly selected from a Swedish strain collection over the last 10 years and noted that 96/107 (89.7%) PorB1a and 16/83 (19.3%) PorB1b bound C4BP; C4BP binding significantly correlated with the ability to evade complement-dependent killing (r = 0.78; p<0.0001). We designed two chimeric proteins that fused C4BP domains to the backbone of immunoglobulins IgG or IgM (C4BP-IgG; C4BP-IgM) with the aim of enhancing complement activation and killing of gonococci. Both proteins bound gonococci (Kd C4BP-IgM = 2.4 nM; Kd C4BP-IgG 981 nM), but only hexameric C4BP-IgM efficiently out-competed heptameric C4BP from bacterial surface resulting in enhanced complement deposition and bacterial killing. Furthermore, C4BP-IgM significantly attenuated the duration and burden of colonization of two C4BP-binding gonococcal isolates, but not a C4BP non-binding strain in the mouse vaginal colonization model using human factor H/C4BP transgenic mice. Our pre-clinical data present C4BP-IgM as an adjunctive to conventional antimicrobials for the treatment of gonorrhea.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663486>Catatonia secondary to anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) encephalitis: a review.</a></h2><p>Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) encephalitis is a relatively recent autoimmune entity, as it was first described in 2007. Given that it is a condition with neuropsychiatric symptoms, its initial symptom is frequently psychiatric in nature. Hence, psychiatrists are often the first physicians to assess these patients and, as so, must recognize this type of encephalitis as a possible cause. Catatonia may be inaugural or develop throughout the course of the disease. Management of patients with anti-NMDAr encephalitis is based on etiologic treatment with  and removal of the associated tumor, if any. However, these catatonic patients may have variable responses to etiologic treatment, sometimes with refractory catatonic symptoms, which attests to the necessary urgency to know how to manage these patients. In the clinical setting, physicians appear to be using guidelines originally created to the management of catatonia due to primary psychiatric conditions. In this literature review, catatonia was historically contextualized and anti-NMDAr encephalitis overall described. Finally, catatonia secondary to this type of encephalitis was discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643018>Driving the CAR to the Bone Marrow Transplant Program.</a></h2><p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved two commercially available chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies for the treatment of relapsed B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) children and young adults less than 25 years of age and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults after promising results from early-phase single and multi-institutional clinical trials. In this review, we provide an overview of the practical aspects of a chimeric antigen T cell receptor (CAR-T) program development and the steps necessary for its successful implementation.CAR-T therapy is a complex process and poses significant challenges as institutions prepare to deliver this therapy as a standard of care for the eligible patients. It requires a rigorous infrastructure with specific clinical, administrative, and regulatory demands. Institutions that led the clinical trials for CAR-T have adopted various approaches to integrate commercial CAR-T products into their program. Delivering commercial CAR-T cells outside the scope of clinical trials requires careful planning, allocation of resources, and utilization of existing infrastructure.

Disruption of immune tolerance is the key mechanism of action of checkpoint inhibitors and, whilst immune-related adverse events are a typical class effect of these compounds, the relationship between toxicity and response is not fully understood. Awareness and vigilance are paramount in recognising potentially life-threatening toxicities and managing them in a timely manner.

Recently, a lot of effort has been put into assessing the potential of gram-positive strains such as lactic acid bacteria for new applications in the production of heterologous proteins. Ama r 2 is a respiratory allergen from Amaranthus retroflexus, whose recombinant production in the probiotic host could be introduced as a specific and effective way to rapid diagnosis and  of this allergy. Consequently, the production of this recombinant protein using the prokaryotic system, requires a suitable SP to protect disulfide bonds and to prevent misfolding. This study was designed to predict the best SPs for the expression of Ama r 2 protein in Lactococcus lactis as the host. In this study, 42 signal sequences were selected from SP databases and the most important features of them were evaluated. First, n, h and c regions of the SPs and their probabilities were investigated by signalP software version 4.1. Then, their physicochemical properties were evaluated by Portparam and SOLpro. Moreover, the secretion sorting and sub-cellular localization sites were evaluated by PRED-TAT and ProtcompB software programs. The results revealed that yjgB, entC2 (Entrotoxine type C-2), ent B (Entrotoxine type), blaZ (Beta lactamase), dex (number 21), blm (Beta lactamase 2) dex (Dextranase; number 20) and number 26 were introduced theatrically as the best SPs to express Ama r 2 in Lactococcus lactis.Copyright © 2019.

These small vesicles are considered to be novel cross-talk circuits established by tumor cells and tumor microenvironment. Previous studies have shown certain biological influence of exosomal programmed cell-death ligand 1 (Exo-PD-L1) on immune suppression and dysfunction. The aim of the current study was to investigate the impact of Exo-PD-L1 and soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and explore the concordance between Exo-PD-L1 and PD-L1 expression in matched tumor tissues in NSCLC patients.85 consecutive patients from April 2017 to December 2017 at General Hospital of Eastern Command Theatre who were primarily diagnosed with NSCLC and 27 healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. Two milliliters of whole blood samples were collected from each participant and further centrifuged. Exosomes were derived from serum using the commercial kit (Total Exosome Isolation Kit), which was further identified by Western blotting analysis (CD63/TSG101), transmission electron microscope analysis (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Exosomes were next solubilized for Exo-PD-L1 detection by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA). PD-L1 expression in matched tissue were assessed by PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) (clone 28-8) assay. Tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥ 1% was deemed as "positive" in this study and TPS < 1% was deemed as "negative". Written informed consent were obtained before acquisition of all data and biological sample. Data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0 and Graphpad Prism 5 software. Chi square test was conducted to estimate the correlation between Exo-PD-L1 levels, sPD-L1 levels, PD-L1 IHC profiles and clinicopathological features. For all analysis, a two-sided p < 0.05 was considered significant statistically.Exo-PD-L1 levels were higher in NSCLC patients with advanced tumor stage, larger tumor size (> 2.5 cm) (p < 0.001), positive lymph node status (p < 0.05) and distant metastasis (p < 0.05). In contrast, sPD-L1 levels were not different between NSCLC patients and healthy donors, it was not correlated with any clinicopathologic features except for tumor size (> 2.5 cm) (p < 0.05). In addition, Exo-PD-L1 levels showed slight correlation with sPD-L1 levels (Spearman's correlation at r = 0.3, p = 0.0027) while no correlation with PD-L1 IHC profiles was detected.In conclusion, Exo-PD-L1, but not sPD-L1, was correlated with NSCLC disease progression, including tumor size, lymph node status, metastasis and TNM stage. However, Exo-PD-L1 was not associated with PD-L1 IHC status.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648401>Comparative study of Autoimplantation therapy and Intralesional injection of MMR vaccine in warts treatment.</a></h2><p>Autoimplantation is a simple technique and considered as a novel method of  in treating warts. Intralesional  by Mumps, Measles, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine is also a promising treatment modality for multiple warts.To compare the efficacy and safety of both the methods in treating multiple warts.The study included 80 patients divided into two groups (group A and group B), each containing 40 patients. Informed consent was taken from each patient before enrollment into the study. Group A patients were treated by autoimplantation technique every two weeks for a maximum of four treatments. Similarly, Group B patients received MMR intralesional injection at a dose of 0.5 mL every two weeks for a maximum of four treatments.Complete clearance of the donor wart was observed in 60% patients in group A, whereas complete clearance in the group B injected by MMR was 72.5%. On the other hand, a significant difference (p<0.05) was found in the therapeutic response among non-manipulated warts in both groups, where complete clearance was observed in 47.5% of group A patients versus 20% of group B patients.Autoimplantation is a suitable approach for patients with multiple warts associated with distant lesions, while MMR injection is ideal for a single or fewer number of warts.

However, immune checkpoint blockade is still suboptimal in HCC treatment and more immune modifications are needed to achieve an efficient therapeutic goal. Here, we investigated the combined administration of a Listeria-based HCC vaccine, Lmdd-MPFG, and the anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade antibody. We found that Lmdd-MPFG promoted the expression of PD-L1 in HCC cells but resensitized the tumor local T cell to respond to the anti-PD-1 . Mechanistically, the Lmdd-MPFG vaccine activates the NF-κB pathway in the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) through the TLR2 and MyD88 pathway, and recruits p62 to activate the autophagy pathway. The overall effect is skewing the TAMs from M2-polarized TAMs into the M1-polarized TAMs. Most importantly, it skewed the cytokine profiles into antitumor one in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This change restores the T-cell reactivity to the anti-PD-1 blockade. Our results suggested that Lmdd-MPFG combined with PD-1 blockade exerted synergistic antitumor effects through modifying TAMs in the TME and removing T-cell inhibitory signals, thereby providing a new potential strategy for HCC treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673481>The efficacy and safety of combination of PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors: a meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Recently, a series of clinical trials showed that combination of anti-programmed cell death-1 (α-PD-1) and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (α-CTLA-4) could effectively eliminate tumor. However, in comparison with widely adopted mono-immune checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy, the advantage of combination therapy of α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4 in response rate and prognosis is controversial especially considering probably increased treatment related adverse event. Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis to explore the efficacy and safety of combination treatment of α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4.This meta-analysis involved 8 clinical trials. In most trials, the primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Thus we calculated risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to compare ORR of patients undergoing different treatment strategies. Moreover, the co-primary endpoints in few trials included progression-free survival and overall survival. Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI were employed to weigh the influence of different treatments on prognosis of patients. Subgroup analysis was conducted in patients with high and low expression of PD-L1. Lastly, the safety of combination therapy was evaluated by comparing treatment related adverse events among various treatment groups.Our results showed that ORR was significantly higher in patients receiving α-PD-1 plus α-CTLA-4 compared with α-PD-1 (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16-1.48) or α-CTLA-4 monotherapy (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.84-2.43), chemotherapy and targeted therapy (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.26-1.58). α-PD-1 plus α-CTLA-4 treated patients had a great advantage on monotherapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy treated patients in PFS. Notably, no significant alteration in total adverse event rate was observed in α-PD-1 plus α-CTLA-4 treated patients. Results of subgroup analysis showed that combination therapy could enhance anti-tumor response in comparison with other treatments, especially for low PD-L1 expression patients undergoing nivolumab treatment (ORR: RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.11-1.65).Combination treatment of α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4 is a feasible strategy with enhanced efficacy and acceptable adverse event. Moreover, for some low PD-L1 expression patients, α-CTLA-4 might decrease the risk of resistance to α-PD-1 and demonstrate the synergistic anti-tumor effect.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653037>Multimerization through Pegylation Improves Pharmacokinetic Properties of scFv Fragments of GD2-Specific Antibodies.</a></h2><p>Antigen-binding fragments of antibodies specific to the tumor-associated ganglioside GD2 are well poised to play a substantial role in modern GD2-targeted cancer therapies, however, rapid elimination from the body and reduced affinity compared to full-length antibodies limit their therapeutic potential. In this study, scFv fragments of GD2-specific antibodies 14.18 were produced in a mammalian expression system that specifically bind to ganglioside GD2, followed by site-directed pegylation to generate mono-, di-, and tetra-scFv fragments. Fractionated pegylated dimers and tetramers of scFv fragments showed significant increase of the binding to GD2 which was not accompanied by cross-reactivity with other gangliosides. Pegylated multimeric di-scFvs and tetra-scFvs exhibited cytotoxic effects in GD2-positive tumor cells, while their circulation time in blood significantly increased compared with monomeric antibody fragments. We also demonstrated a more efficient tumor uptake of the multimers in a syngeneic GD2-positive mouse cancer model. The findings of this study provide the rationale for improving therapeutic characteristics of GD2-specific antibody fragments by multimerization and propose a strategy to generate such molecules. On the basis of multimeric antibody fragments, bispecific antibodies and conjugates with cytotoxic drugs or radioactive isotopes may be developed that will possess improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645480>CD38-NAD-Sirt1 axis In T cell .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650066>First-in-human phase I clinical trial of a combined immune modulatory approach using TetMYB vaccine and Anti-PD-1 antibody in patients with advanced solid cancer including colorectal or adenoid cystic carcinoma: The MYPHISMO study protocol (NCT03287427).</a></h2><p>MYB is a transcription factor that is overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) and also a driver mutation in adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC). Therefore, the MYB protein is an ideal target to vaccinate against to aid recruitment of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) against these tumours. The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (Melbourne, Australia) has engineered a DNA vaccine, TetMYB, based on the pVAX1 plasmid vector carrying a fusion construct consisting of the universal tetanus toxin T-cell epitopes flanking an inactivated  gene.This prospective first-in-human phase I single-arm multi-centre clinical trial involves patients with metastatic CRC or AdCC. Stage 1 will evaluate the safety profile of escalating doses of TetMYB vaccine, given sequentially and in combination with an anti-PD-1 inhibitory antibody, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Stage 2 will assess the MTD in an expanded cohort. The calculated sample size is 32 patients: 12 in Stage 1 and 20 in Stage 2. The expected total duration of the trial is 3 years with 15 months of recruitment followed by a minimum of 18 months follow-up.MYB transcription factor is aberrantly overexpressed in a range of epithelial cancers, not limited to the above tumour types. Based on promising pre-clinical data of vaccine-induced tumour clearance and establishment of anti-tumour memory, we are embarking on this first-in-human trial. If successful, the results from this trial will allow progression to a Phase II trial and validation of this breakthrough immunotherapeutic approach, not only in CRC and AdCC, but other MYB over-expressing cancers.ClinicalTrials.gov ID: .

Even when response is obtained, regrowth of the tumors is almost inevitable. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of helical tomotherapy for chemo-refractory multiple liver metastases.Forty-five patients with chemo-refractory multiple (3-10) liver metastases after standard systemic chemotherapy entered the single-institutional prospective study. Liver metastases were the major disease; however, 31 also had uncontrolled primary lesions and/or other metastases. The prescribed dose was 55 Gy in 25 fractions. The median planning target volume (PTV) and normal liver volume (NLV) of first treatment were 128 cm and 1175 cm , respectively. The median of V , V , and mean dose to NLV were 45%, 23%, and 19.4 Gy, respectively.Forty-two patients (93%) completed the planned treatment. Median survival time (MST) for all patients was 8 months, and the 1-year survival rate was 29%. The median local control (LC) period was 5 months and the 6-month control rate of irradiated tumors was 33%. A ≥30% decrease in tumor markers was observed in 31%. The most common grade 3 toxicity was lymphocytopenia (40%), followed by fatigue (6%). Radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) was not observed. Pancreatic cancer as the primary tumor, distant metastases outside the liver, low pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and low pretreatment monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) were associated with poorer prognoses.Helical tomotherapy for chemo-refractory multiple liver metastases is a feasible and potentially effective treatment.

However, limited progress with Tim-3  has been achieved over the last decade due to the lack of specific Tim-3 monoclonal antibodies. In this study, we have successfully developed a unique set of Tim-3 antibodies that are able to detect different molecular weights (by Western blot mobility) of Tim-3 proteins ectopically expressed in the same CHO cells. Some of the antibody clones detect only 33 or 55 kDa bands, the rest can recognize both 33 and 55 kDa bands on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. Antibody clones with 55 kDa specificity uniquely bind to the membrane form of Tim-3 on macrophage, which colocalizes with the CD68, and could be used as a specific marker for tumor-associated macrophage, whereas other clones showed cytoplasmic staining in tumor cells. The membrane form of Tim-3 on tumor-associated macrophages may bear significant roles for clinical application of Tim-3, but less likely for cytoplasmic one. The availability of this unique set of antibodies will be critical for an ultimate understanding of Tim-3 function in tumor microenvironment and potential clinical applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668880>Peptides of tetraspanin oncoprotein CD151 trigger active immunity against primary tumour and experimental lung metastasis.</a></h2><p>Active  is an effective, long-lasting, cheap, and safe approach to suppress cancer progression; however, the key issue is to develop appropriate tumour vaccines. Oncoproteins are up-regulated under various stress conditions and promote cell survival. Oncoproteins and their immunogenic domains could serve well as tumour vaccines and prime the hosts' active anti-tumour immunity.Proteomic and bioinformatic analyses were performed to identify potential tumour associated antigens (TAAs). Then, peptides derived from CD151 were designed and synthesized according to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I binding and immunogenicity. Cytotoxicity assay, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and in vivo bioluminescence imaging were performed to assess the active anti-tumour immunity triggered by CD151 peptides in H22 primary hepatoma and experimental 4T1 breast cancer lung metastasis models.CD151 was identified as an ideal TAA based on proteomic and bioinformatic analyses. CD151 peptides as tumour vaccines triggered active anti-tumour immunity against H22 hepatoma and the lung metastasis of 4T1 breast cancer in two mouse models through the activation of CD8IFNγ lymphocytes and the subsequent targeted cytotoxicity. Further, the peptides suppressed the negative regulators, myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Survival was prolonged for mice with lung metastases from CD151 peptide-immunised groups.The up-regulated oncoproteins in 8 Gy-irradiated tumour cells are good candidates for designing immunogenic peptides as tumour vaccines. Anti-tumour active immunity primed by peptides from CD151 may be an effective and safe approach to suppress cancer progression.Copyright © 2019.

Targeting an appropriate B cell epitope in pathological tau could in theory produce an effective reduction of pathology without disrupting the function of normal native tau. Recent data demonstrate that the N-terminal region of tau (aa 2-18), termed the "phosphatase activation domain (PAD)", is hidden within native Tau in a 'paperclip'-like conformation. Conversely, PAD is exposed in pathological tau and plays an essential role in the inhibition of fast axonal transport and tau polymerization. Thus, we hypothesized that anti-tau2-18 antibodies may safely and specifically reduce pathological tau and prevent further aggregation, which in turn would neutralize tau toxicity. Therefore, we evaluated the immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy of our MultiTEP platform-based vaccine targeting tau2-18 formulated with Advax adjuvant (AV-1980R/A) in PS19 tau transgenic mice. The AV-1980R/A induced extremely high antibody responses and the resulting sera recognized neurofibrillary tangles and plaque-associated dystrophic neurites in AD brain sections. In addition, under non-denaturing conditions AV-1980R/A sera preferentially recognized AD-associated tau. Importantly, vaccination also prevented age-related motor and cognitive deficits in PS19 mice and significantly reduced insoluble total and phosphorylated tau species. Taken together, these findings suggest that predominantly targeting misfolded tau with AV-1980R/A could represent an effective strategy for AD .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649669>Dendritic Cell Vaccination in Metastatic Melanoma Turns "Non-T Cell Inflamed" Into "T-Cell Inflamed" Tumors.</a></h2><p>Dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccination effectively induces anti-tumor immunity, although in the majority of cases this does not translate into a durable clinical response. However, DC vaccination is characterized by a robust safety profile, making this treatment a potential candidate for effective combination cancer . To explore this possibility, understanding changes occurring in the tumor microenvironment (TME) upon DC vaccination is required. In this line, quantitative and qualitative changes in tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) induced by vaccination with autologous tumor lysate/homogenate loaded DCs were investigated in a series of 16 patients with metastatic melanoma. Immunohistochemistry for CD4, CD8, Foxp3, Granzyme B (GZMB), PDL1, and HLA class I was performed in tumor biopsies collected before and after DC vaccination. The density of each marker was quantified by automated digital pathology analysis on whole slide images. Co-expression of markers defining functional phenotypes, i.e., Foxp3 regulatory CD4 T cells (Treg) and GZMB cytotoxic CD8 T cells, was assessed with sequential immunohistochemistry. A significant increase of CD8 TILs was found in post-vaccine biopsies of patients who were not previously treated with immune-modulating cytokines or Ipilimumab. Interestingly, along with a maintained tumoral HLA class I expression, after DC vaccination we observed a significant increase of PDL1 tumor cells, which significantly correlated with intratumoral CD8 T cell density. This observation might explain the lack of a significant concurrent cytotoxic reactivation of CD8 T cell, as measured by the numbers of GZMB T cells. Altogether these findings indicate that DC vaccination exerts an important role in sustaining or  inducing a T cell inflamed TME. However, the strength of the intratumoral T cell activation detected in post-DC therapy lesions is lessened by an occurring phenomenon of adaptive immune resistance, yet the concomitant PDL1 up-regulation. Overall, this study sheds light on DC -induced TME changes, lending the rationale for the design of smarter immune-combination therapies.Copyright © 2019 Bulgarelli, Tazzari, Granato, Ridolfi, Maiocchi, de Rosa, Petrini, Pancisi, Gentili, Vergani, Piccinini, Carbonaro, Leone, Foschi, Ancarani, Framarini and Guidoboni.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646201>CMTM6, the newly identified PD-L1 regulator, correlates with PD-L1 expression in lung cancers.</a></h2><p>Modulation of Immune check point regulators, especially the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, plays a critical role in successful management of a small proportion of lung cancer patients, but not so effective in the rest of lung cancer patients. A better understanding of  non-responsive or resistant patients therefore warranted for future development of novel therapeutics. The newly identified regulator CMTM6 (CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain containing 6) has been reported to serves as the stabilizer of PD-L1 and enhances the inhibitory effect of PD-L1 on immune system in both cell line and animal models, but its clinical relevance associated with PD-L1 is unknown and the current study is designed to address this question. The study using immunohistochemistry demonstrated that CMTM6 positivity from 15 out of 19 types of cancers with our in-house tissue microarray, and PD-L1 expression is always found only in CMTM6 positive cancers. CMTM6 and PD-L1 expression were analyzed in 81 lung cancer patient sample, and we observed that CMTM6 expression correlated with cancer histotypes and inversely correlated with cancer metastases, but not with patients' age and gender. No PD-L1 expression was observed in negative CMTM6 samples. Higher expression PD-L1 is also associated with higher CMTM6 expression. In summary, CMTM6 expression is associated with PD-L1 expression, as well as lung cancer histotypes and metastasis. The results thus for the first time confirmed earlier reports on CMTM6/PD-L1 connection, from a clinical aspect of analysis.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653618>Pembrolizumab-associated autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.</a></h2><p>Treatment paradigms have recently changed with the introduction of ; autoimmune toxicities that can arise are frequently very different from the more familiar chemotherapy toxicities.

For patients who received these treatments, median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) exceeded that of historical controls treated with systemic therapy alone (9.7-23.5 and 13.5-41.2 months, respectively). Additionally, three trials randomized oligometastatic NSCLC patients to standard of care systemic therapy regimens  local consolidative therapy (LCT) plus standard of care systemic therapy (or observation) and all demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS, with two showing OS benefits to date. Notably, a majority of these trials selected patients with at least stable disease after completion of systemic therapy for local therapy and defined the oligometastatic state as one with no more than five metastatic sites spread across three organs. For patients with oligometastatic NSCLC, there are many important factors that should drive use and timing of local therapy, including metastatic presentation sequence (synchronous  metachronous), extent of disease (number and distribution of sites), and quality of life goals. The referenced clinical trials accrued patients prior to the approval of  for metastatic NSCLC, so the benefits of any local therapy in this setting remain uncertain. To ultimately clarify the role of local therapy in oligometastatic NSCLC in the era of improving systemic therapy efficacy (i.e.,  and targeted therapy combinations with cytotoxics), we recommend enrollment in in phase III studies with OS endpoints (i.e., NRG LU 002 and SARON) whenever possible. These and other important issues associated with local therapy for oligometastatic NSCLC are reviewed in this paper.2019 Translational Lung Cancer Research.

The aim of this review is to outline the latest developments and regulatory considerations in this field, with a particular emphasis to differences and similarities between academic and industry approaches and the role they should play to coexist and move forward together.

The clinical syndromes have phenotypes which are often highly characteristic of their associated antigen-specific autoantibody. For example, the constellation of psychiatric features and the multi-faceted movement disorder observed in patients with NMDAR antibodies are highly distinctive, as are the faciobrachial dystonic seizures observed in close association with LGI1 antibodies. These typically tight correlations may be conferred by the presence of autoantibodies which can directly access and modulate their antigens in vivo. AE remains an under-recognised clinical syndrome but one where early and accurate detection is critical as prompt initiation of  is closely associated with improved outcomes. In this review of a rapidly emerging field, we outline molecular observations with translational value. We focus on contemporary methodologies of autoantibody detection, the evolution and distinctive nature of the clinical phenotypes, generalisable therapeutic paradigms, and finally discuss the likely mechanisms of autoimmunity in these patients which may inform future precision therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649250>Nogo receptor-vimentin interaction: a novel mechanism for the invasive activity of glioblastoma multiforme.</a></h2><p>Nogo receptor (NgR) has been shown to inhibit the migration and invasion of human glioma cells. However, little is known regarding the regulatory mechanisms of NgR in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In this study, we propose a novel mechanism that regulates the maturation process of NgR through an interaction with vimentin. The inhibition of TGFβ1 activity by LY2109761 attenuated the migration/invasion of GBM cells by upregulating cell-surface NgR. Conversely, the treatment of GBM cells with TGFβ1 suppressed NgR maturation. We showed that NgR and vimentin interact, which could be a possible mechanism for the suppression of NgR maturation. The knockdown of vimentin suppressed the migration/invasion of GBM cells through the increased maturation of NgR. Finally, TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) analysis also supported the association of NgR and vimentin. The maturation of NgR is regulated by the interaction of vimentin and NgR, which attenuates the invasive activity of GBM, and might be a potential therapeutic target for brain cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668739>Signalling molecules and epigenetic targeting in cancer  - Comments on "Epigenetic modulation enhances  for hepatocellular carcinoma".</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661975>Single Cell Sequencing of Mouse Heart Immune Infiltrate in Pressure Overload-Driven Heart Failure Reveals Extent of Immune Activation.</a></h2><p> Inflammation is a key component of cardiac disease, with macrophages and T lymphocytes mediating essential roles in the progression to heart failure (HF). Nonetheless, little insight exists on other immune subsets involved in the cardiotoxic response.  Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to map the cardiac immune composition in the standard murine non-ischemic, pressure-overload HF model. By focusing our analysis on CD45 cells, we obtained a higher resolution identification of the immune cell subsets in the heart, at early and late stages of disease and in controls. We then integrated our findings using multi-parameter flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and tissue clarification immunofluorescence, in mouse and human.  We found that most major immune cell subpopulations, including macrophages, B cells, T cells and regulatory T cells (Treg), dendritic cells, NK cells, neutrophils and mast cells are present in both healthy and diseased hearts. Most cell subsets are found within the myocardium, whilst mast cells are found also in the epicardium. Upon induction of pressure overload, immune activation occurs across the entire range of immune cell types. Activation led to upregulation of key subset-specific molecules, such as Osm in pro-inflammatory macrophages and PD-1 in Treg, that may help explain clinical findings such as the refractivity of HF patients to anti-TNF therapy and cardiac toxicity during anti-PD-1 cancer , respectively.  Despite the absence of infectious agents or an autoimmune trigger, induction of disease leads to immune activation that involves far more cell types than previously thought, including neutrophils, B cells, NK cells and mast cells. This opens up the field of cardio-immunology to further investigation using toolkits that have already been developed to study the immune subsets above. The subset-specific molecules that mediate their activation may thus become useful targets for diagnostics or therapy of HF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668206> and Radiation: Charting a Path Forward Together.</a></h2><p>Preclinical studies combining  and radiation therapy have suggested promising synergy, prompting translation into clinical trials. Radiation has been shown to significantly alter the tumor microenvironment, cause immunogenic cell death, and potentiate anti-tumor immune responses. Several radiation parameters may modulate these effects. Clinical data to date have suggested that combination therapy is largely well tolerated, but additional study is warranted to better estimate both short-term and long-term risks of combination treatment and extend these data to new  agents. Ensuring proper radiation access and quality is critical to the success of future trials.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The principle of action can be explained as "brake theory". After releasing the brakes by ICIs, unprecedented systemic toxicities, even some refractory and fatal immune-related adverse effects (irAEs) may develop. In this article, we summarized the recommended treatments of grade 3-4 severe irAEs in the latest European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)/American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), Society for  of Cancer (SITC) and Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) guidelines and consensus. We also performed a systemic review of case reports and reviews of irAEs up to May 20, 2019 in PubMed and Chinese journals. Successful applications of specific immunosuppressive drugs and stimulating factors beyond the above guidelines and consensus were supplemented and highlighted, including agents blocking interleukin 6 (IL-6), rituximab, anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) monoclonal antibody (mAb), anti-integrin 4 mAb, Janus kinase inhibitors, thrombopoietin receptor agonists and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) etc. We put some concerns of using high-dose steroids for long-term, and emphasize the secondary infections, tumor progression, and unavailability of ICI re-challenge during steroid treatment. We propose the "De-escalation Therapy" principle for severe and refractory irAEs, and suggest that immunosuppressive drugs specifically targeting cytokines should be used as early as possible. Many irAEs in the era of  are unprecedented compared with traditional chemotherapy and small-molecule targeted therapy, which is a big challenge to oncologists. Therefore, the establishment of multidisciplinary system is very important for the management of cancer patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663384>Blockade of the CD47-SIRPα axis: a promising approach for cancer .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646104>Extracellular vesicles released by ovarian carcinoma contain arginase 1 that mitigates antitumor immune response.</a></h2><p>Expression of arginase-1 (ARG1) is an immunosuppressive feature of tumor microenvironment that leads to depletion of ʟ-arginine, a nutrient required for T-cells expansion.

Herein we report an integrated nanoplatform that combines PDT with  to enhance photodynamic therapeutic effects and simultaneously inhibit tumor cells resistance/evasion. To achieve this, we fabricated Mn@CaCO/ICG nanoparticles and loaded them with PD-L1-targeting siRNA.  Thanks to the protection of CaCO on the loaded ICG and the oxygen produced by MnO, an enhanced photodynamic therapeutic effect  was observed.  experiments demonstrated that the nanoplatform could efficiently deliver the loaded drug to the tumor tissues and significantly improve tumor hypoxia, which further contributes to the therapeutic effect of PDT . Moreover, the synergistic benefits derived from the siRNA, which silenced the checkpoint gene PD-L1 that mediates the immune resistance/evasion, resulted in a surprising therapeutic effect to rouse the immune system.  The combination treatment strategy has great potential to be developed as a new and robust method for enhanced PDT therapy with high efficiency and a powerful antitumor immune response based on PD-L1 blockade.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646064>Tasquinimod targets suppressive myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment.</a></h2><p>Infiltrating myeloid derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are important components of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.

The reliability of the PD-L1 22C3 pharmDx assay is critical in guiding clinical practice. The Cardiopulmonary Pathology Study Group of the Korean Society of Pathologists investigated the interobserver reproducibility of PD-L1 staining with 22C3 pharmDx in NSCLC samples.Twenty-seven pathologists individually assessed the tumor proportion score (TPS) for 107 NSCLC samples. Each case was divided into three levels based on TPS: <1%, 1%-49%, and ≥50%.The intraclass correlation coefficient for TPS was 0.902±0.058. Weighted κ coefficient for 3-step assessment was 0.748±0.093. The κ coefficients for 1% and 50% cut-offs were 0.633 and 0.834, respectively. There was a significant association between interobserver reproducibility and experience (formal PD-L1 training, more experience for PD-L1 assessment, and longer practice duration on surgical pathology), histologic subtype, and specimen type.Our results indicate that PD-L1 immunohistochemical staining provides a reproducible basis for decisions on anti-PD-1 therapy in NSCLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665482>Unraveling triple-negative breast cancer tumor microenvironment heterogeneity: towards an optimized treatment approach.</a></h2><p>Recent efforts of gene expression profiling analyses recognized at least 4 different triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) molecular subtypes. However, little is known regarding their tumor microenvironment (TME) heterogeneity.Here, we investigated TME heterogeneity within each TNBC molecular subtype including immune infiltrate localization and composition together with expression of targetable immune pathways using publicly available transcriptomic and genomic datasets from a large TNBC series totaling 1512 samples. Associations between molecular subtypes and specific features was assessed using logistic regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided.We demonstrated that each TNBC molecular subtype exhibits distinct TME profiles associated with specific immune, vascularization, stroma and metabolism biological processes together with specific immune composition and localization. The immunomodulatory subtype was associated with the highest expression of adaptive immune-related gene signatures and a fully inflamed spatial pattern appearing to be the optimal candidate for immune check-point inhibitors. In contrast, most mesenchymal stem-like and luminal androgen receptor (LAR) tumors showed an immunosuppressive phenotype as witnessed by high expression levels of stromal signatures. Basal-like, LAR and Mesenchymal subtypes exhibited an immune cold phenotype associated with stromal and metabolism TME signatures and enriched in margin restricted spatial pattern. Tumors with high chromosomal instability and copy number loss in chromosome 5q and 15q regions including genomic loss of MHC-related genes showed reduced cytotoxic activity, as a plausible immune escape mechanism.Our results demonstrate that each TNBC subtype is associated with specific TME profiles, setting the ground for a rationale tailoring of  in TNBC patients.© The Author(s) 2019.

Pre- and post-SVR clinical and histological data were collected.Of patients, 83% (33/40), 38% (15/40) and 83% (33/40) achieved inflammation improvement, fibrosis regression and histological improvement, respectively. Liver stiffness measurements (LSM), APRI, and FIB-4 could predict post-SVR fibrosis well without significant differences. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves of LSM, APRI, and FIB-4 were 0.78, 0.81, and 0.87 for post-SVR advanced fibrosis (≥ F4) and 0.86, 0.86, and 0.85 for post-SVR cirrhosis (≥ F5), respectively. Pre-SVR LSM, APRI, and FIB-4 values were significantly lower in patients with fibrosis regression (P = 0.003-0.012), while FIB-4 was significantly lower in patients with histological improvement (P = 0.012-0.033). Patients with higher pre-SVR Ishak scores tended to have bigger decline in APRI (P = 0.025) and FIB-4 (P = 0.024) after SVR.DAA could improve liver inflammation and fibrosis of HCV patients in a short time after SVR.

The frequently used  agents are immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as antibodies specific to PD1, PD-L1, or CTLA-4. However, these drugs are highly expensive, and most people in the world cannot access the treatment. The development of recombinant protein production platforms that are cost-effective, scalable, and safe is needed. Plant platforms are attractive because of their low production cost, speed, scalability, lack of human and animal pathogens, and post-translational modifications that enable them to produce effective monoclonal antibodies. In this study, an anti-PD1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was transiently produced in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. The plant-produced anti-PD1 mAb was compared to the commercial nivolumab produced in CHO cells. Our results showed that both antibodies have similar protein structures, and the N-glycans on the plant-produced antibody lacks plant-specific structures. The PD1 binding affinity of the plant-produced and commercial nivolumab, determined by two different techniques, that is, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), are also comparable. Plant-produced nivolumab binds to human PD1 protein with high affinity and specificity, blocks the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, and enhances T cell function, comparable to commercial nivolumab.

One objective is assessing antigen-induced T cell activation because only functionally active T cells are capable of killing the desired targets. Autofluorescence imaging can distinguish T cell activity states in a non-destructive manner by detecting endogenous changes in metabolic co-enzymes such as NAD(P)H. However, recognizing robust activity patterns is computationally challenging in the absence of exogenous labels. We demonstrate machine learning methods that can accurately classify T cell activity across human donors from NAD(P)H intensity images. Using 8,260 cropped single-cell images from six donors, we evaluate classifiers ranging from traditional models that use previously-extracted image features to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) pre-trained on general non-biological images. Adapting pre-trained CNNs for the T cell activity classification task provides substantially better performance than traditional models or a simple CNN trained with the autofluorescence images alone. Visualizing the images with dimension reduction provides intuition into why the CNNs achieve higher accuracy than other approaches.

Immunotherapeutical agents represent an emerging option for breast cancer treatment, including the human epidermal growth factor 2 positive (HER2+) subtype. The immune system holds the ability to spontaneously implement a defensive response against HER2+ BC cells through complex mechanisms which can be exploited to modulate this response for obtaining a clinical benefit. Initial immune system modulating strategies consisted mostly in vaccine therapies, which are still being investigated and improved. However, the entrance of trastuzumab into the scenery of HER2+ BC treatment was the real game changing event, which embodied a dominant immune-mediated mechanism. More recently, the advent of the immune checkpoint inhibitors has caused a new paradigm shift for immuno-oncology, with promising initial results also for HER2+ BC. Breast cancer has been traditionally considered poorly immunogenic, being characterized by relatively low tumor mutation burden (TMB). Nevertheless, recent evidence has revealed high tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in a considerable proportion of HER2+ BC patients. This may translate into a higher potential to elicit anti-cancer response and, therefore, wider possibilities for the use and implementation of  in this subset of BC patients. We are herein presenting and critically discussing the most representative evidence concerning  in HER2+ BC cancer, both singularly and in combination with therapeutic agents acting throughout HER2-block, immune checkpoint inhibition and anti-cancer vaccines.

Tumor heterogeneity that often leads to distinct functional phenotypes contributes to glioblastoma (GB) indispensable growth and aggressiveness. The complex interaction of neoplastic cells with tumor microenvironment (TME) along with the presence of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) largely confers to extrinsic and intrinsic GB heterogeneity. Recent data indicate that glioma cells secrete a variety of soluble immunoregulatory factors to attract different cell types to TME including astrocytes, endothelial cells, circulating stem cells, and a range of immune cells. These further induce a local production of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors which upon crosstalk with extracellular matrix (ECM) components reprogram immune cells to inflammatory or anti-inflammatory phenotypes and manipulate host's immune response in favor of cancer growth and metastasis. Herein, we provide an overview of the immunobiologic factors that orchestrate the complex network of glioma cells and TME interactions in an effort to identify potential therapeutic targets for GB malignancy. Current therapeutic schemes and advances in targeting GB-TME crosstalk are further discussed.

Multimodal therapies employing agents that can affect different arms of the immune system and/or tumor microenvironment might increase clinical responses.We demonstrate that entinostat, a class I histone deacetylase inhibitor, enhances the anti-tumor efficacy of the IL-15 superagonist, N-803 plus vaccine in 4T1 triple-negative breast and MC38-CEA colon murine carcinoma models. A comprehensive immune and gene expression analysis was performed in the periphery and/or tumor microenvironment (TME) of MC38-CEA tumor-bearing mice.Although N-803 plus vaccine induced peripheral CD8 T cell activation and cytokine production, there was no reduction in tumor burden and poor tumor infiltration of CD8 T cells with minimal levels of granzyme B. For the first time, we demonstrate that the addition of entinostat to N-803 plus vaccine promoted significant tumor control, correlating with increased expression of genes associated with tumor inflammation, enhanced infiltration of activated CD8 T cells with maximal granzyme B, T-cell responses to multiple tumor-associated antigens, increased serum IFNg, reduction of regulatory T cells in the TME, and decreased expression of the checkpoint V-domain Ig Suppressor of T cell Activation (VISTA) on multiple immune subsets.Collectively, these data demonstrate that the synergistic combination of entinostat, N-803, and vaccine elicits potent anti-tumor activity by generating a more inflamed TME. These findings thus form the rationale for the use of this combination of agents for patients harboring poorly or non-inflamed solid carcinomas.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651527>PD-L1 Expression in Endometrial Carcinoma Cells and Intratumoral Immune Cells: Differences Across Histologic and TCGA-based Molecular Subgroups.</a></h2><p>Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a biomarker that may predict the response to anti-programmed death 1/PD-L1 . We evaluated the expression of PD-L1 in carcinoma cells (Ca) and immune cells (ICs) across histopathologic and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) molecular subgroups of endometrial carcinoma (EC). Our study included 842 patients with EC. Direct sequencing of polymerase epsilon (POLE) exonuclease domain hot spots and conventional immunohistochemistry (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6, p53) were conducted to identify TCGA classification-based molecular subgroups of EC: POLE-mutated, mismatch repair deficient, no specific molecular profile, and p53 aberrant. Multiplex immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate PD-L1 expression in Ca and tumor-infiltrating ICs. PD-L1 expression in Ca and in ICs was detected in 8.6% and 27.7% of the cases, respectively. A combined positive score (CPS) was ≥1% in 19.4% of the samples. PD-L1 positivity in Ca and ICs, and CPS correlated with tumor T-cell density (P<0.001). POLE-mutated and mismatch repair-deficient tumors were more likely to present PD-L1-expressing ICs, CPS positivity, and abundant tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes compared with other TCGA subgroups (P<0.001). No differences existed in Ca-PD-L1 expression (P=0.366). Within various histotypes, non-endometrioid carcinomas displayed the highest Ca-PD-L1, ICs, and CPS (P<0.03). Advanced cancers showed more frequent Ca-PD-L1 positivity (P=0.016), and CPS (P=0.029) and IC≥1% (P=0.037) positivity compared with early disease. In conclusion, PD-L1 expression profiles differ between molecular subclasses, histologic subtypes, and disease stage of EC. Prospective studies are needed to explore the predictive value of various PD-L1 scoring systems within the subgroups of EC.

Diverse types and etiologies of NORSE are reported in various groups. Limbic encephalitis (LE) is reported as one of etiologies of NORSE. In this study, we investigated whether there were any intersections between NORSE and limbic encephalitis, as well as the presence of prognostic factors in intersection patients.We retrospectively analyzed patients who met both the definition of NORSE and diagnostic criteria of LE at the initial presentation from our database.

Prognosis was recorded as ICU admission stay, total length of hospitalization, and modified Rankin Scale at discharge. In particular, we determined which factors were associated with patients' prognosis.Thirteen patients were selected. Nine of the 13 patients had myalgia and 8 patients had fever in the prodromal period. Twelve of the 13 patients had acute memory impairment or confusion before SE development.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have a crucial role in the regulation of anticancer immune responses, but the association of miRNA expression patterns and TMB is not clear in LUAD. : Differentially expressed miRNAs in samples with high TMB and low TMB samples were screened in the LUAD dataset in The Cancer Genome Atlas. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was applied to develop a miRNA-based signature classifier for predicting TMB levels in the training set. An test set was used to validate this classifier. The correlation between the miRNA-based classifier index and the expression of three immune checkpoints (PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4) were explored. Functional enrichment analysis was carried out of the miRNAs included in the miRNA-based signature classifier. : Twenty-five differentially expressed miRNAs were used to establish a miRNA-based signature classifier for predicting TMB level. The accuracy of the 25-miRNA-based signature classifier was 0.850 in the training set, 0.810 in the test set and 0.840 in the total set. This miRNA-based signature classifier index showed a low correlation with PD-1 and PD-L1, and no correlation with CTLA-4. Enrichment analysis for these 25 miRNA revealed they are involved in many immune-related biological processes and cancer-related pathways. : MiRNA expression patterns are associated with tumor mutational burden and a miRNA-based signature classifier may serve as a biomarker for prediction of TMB levels in LUAD.© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659379>[Studies on radiotherapy of head and neck cancer : Highlights of the 2019 ASCO Annual Meeting].</a></h2><p>Radiotherapy is an important treatment option in patients with head and neck.

We developed a microfluidics-based CTC platform to explore CTC profiling utility in CII-treated patients with melanoma using a melanoma messenger RNA (mRNA)/DNA biomarker panel.Blood samples (n = 213) were collected prospectively from 75 American Joint Committee on Cancer-staged III/IV melanoma patients during CII treatment and those enriched for CTCs. CTC profiling was performed using 5 known melanoma mRNA biomarkers and BRAF V600E DNA mutation. CTC biomarker status associations with clinical outcomes were assessed.CTCs were detected in 88% of blood samples from patients with melanoma. CTC-derived biomarkers and clinical variables analyzed using classification and regression tree analysis revealed that a combination of lactate dehydrogenase, CTC-mRNA biomarkers, and tumor BRAF-mutation status was indicative of clinical outcomes for patients with stage IV melanoma (n = 52). The panel stratified low-risk and high-risk patients, whereby the latter had poor disease-free ( = 0.03) and overall survival ( = 0.02). Incorporation of a DNA biomarker with mRNA profiling increased overall CTC-detection capability by 57% compared to mRNA profiling only.

However, many novel "non-canonical" functions, alternative substrates, and regulatory mechanisms have been described and are being continuously elucidated. The activity of LOXs, therefore, appears to be integrated into a complex network of signals regulating many cell functions, including survival/proliferation/differentiation. Among these signaling pathways, TGF-β and PI3K/Akt/mTOR, in particular, cross-talk extensively with each other and with LOXs also initiating complex feedback loops which modulate the activity of LOXs and direct the remodeling of the ECM. A growing body of evidence indicates that LOXs are not only important in the homeostasis of the normal structure of the ECM, but are also implicated in the establishment and maturation of the tumor microenvironment. LOXs' association with advanced and metastatic cancer is well established; however, there is enough evidence to support a significant role of LOXs in the transformation of normal epithelial cells, in the accelerated tumor development and the induction of invasion of the premalignant epithelium. A better understanding of LOXs and their interactions with the different elements of the tumor immune microenvironment will prove invaluable in the design of novel anti-tumor strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649751>Recombinant baculovirus expressing the FrC-OVA protein induces protective antitumor immunity in an EG7-OVA mouse model.</a></h2><p>The baculovirus (BV)  multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used in numerous protein expression systems because of its ability to infect insect cells and serves as a useful vaccination vector with several benefits, such as its low clinical risks and posttranslational modification ability.

In this study, the stimulation of an immune response against EG7-OVA tumors in mice by a recombinant baculovirus-based combination vaccine expressing fragment C-ovalbumin (FrC-OVA-BV; rBV) was evaluated.We constructed an rBV expressing fragment C (FrC) of tetanus toxin containing a promiscuous MHC II-binding sequence and a p30-ovalbumin (OVA) peptide that functions in the MHC I pathway. The results showed that rBV activated the CD8 T-cell-mediated response much more efficiently than the wild-type BV (wtBV). Experiments with EG7-OVA tumor mouse models showed that rBV significantly decreased tumor volume and increased survival compared with those in the wild-type BV or FrC-OVA DNA vaccine groups. In addition, a significant antitumor effect of classic prophylactic or therapeutic vaccinations was observed for rBV against EG7-OVA-induced tumors compared with that in the controls.Our findings showed that FrC-OVA-BV (rBV) induced antitumor immunity, paving the way for its use in BV  against malignancies.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647026>Tumor immune microenvironment and genomic evolution in a patient with metastatic triple negative breast cancer and a complete response to atezolizumab.</a></h2><p>Metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) has a poor prognosis and few treatment options. The anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab demonstrated clinical activity in mTNBC patients with PD-L1-positive tumor-infiltrating immune cells. The current study describes the tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) and genomic evolution across sequential therapies in a patient with a 31-year history of TNBC and a complete response (CR) to atezolizumab monotherapy.In 1986, the patient had surgery and radiotherapy (XRT) for newly diagnosed TNBC, followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy for two locoregional recurrences. She developed mTNBC in 2009 and was sequentially treated with capecitabine, gemcitabine-carboplatin-iniparib (GCI), XRT and an experimental vaccine. She experienced disease progression (PD) to all these therapies. In 2013, she had a PD-L1 positive tumor and enrolled in a phase 1 atezolizumab monotherapy study (PCD4989g; ). She received atezolizumab for 1 year with initial pseudo-progression followed by a partial response. After 1 year without treatment she experienced PD, reinitiated atezolizumab and subsequently achieved CR. Tumor specimens were collected at numerous times between 2008 and 2015 and assessed by immunohistochemistry, RNA-seq and DNA-seq.TiME biomarkers, including CD8, ICs and PD-L1 on IC, increased after capecitabine and remained high after GCI, XRT and through pseudo-progression on atezolizumab. At PD post-atezolizumab exposure, TiME biomarkers decreased but PD-L1 status remained positive. Immune-related RNA signatures confirmed these findings. TNBC subtyping revealed evolution from luminal androgen receptor (LAR) to basal-like immune activated (BLIA). Genomic profiling showed truncal alterations in RB1 and TP53, while the presence of other genomic alterations varied over time. Tumor mutational burden peaked after XRT and declined after atezolizumab exposure.This case report describes the evolution of TiME and TNBC molecular subtypes/genomics over time with sequential therapies in a TNBC patient with a CR to atezolizumab monotherapy.

Additional strategies are necessary to improve these agents' efficacy.Patients with stable disease for at least 4 months on TKI or checkpoint inhibitors were included. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) was delivered to an organ with comparable lesions, where one lesion was in the treatment target and the other one was intentionally left untreated (control lesion). Response in both lesions was scored using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors V.1.1 criteria 2 months after completion of SBRT. The primary endpoint was the rate of SBRT adverse events, and the secondary endpoints included the rate of reduction in target lesion size.17 patients were enrolled (14 men and 3 women, median age: 54.5 years old). SBRT was delivered to the lungs (n=5), bones (n=4), lymph nodes (n=4), liver (n=1), primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (n=1) and locally recurrent RCC (n=2). The equivalent dose in 2 Gy with an alpha to beta ratio of 2.6 was 114 Gy. With a median follow-up of 8 months, the cumulative rate of SBRT-related toxicity (grade 1) was 12% (n=2), consisting of oesophagitis and skin erythema. No grade 2 or higher toxicity was detected. Radiographic response in the target lesion was seen in 13 patients (76%), with complete response in 5 (29%) patients and partial response in 8 (47%), including abscopal effect in 1 patient. Control lesions remained stable in 16 patients.

These structures can be covered by filter-like diaphragms. A transmembrane PLVAP (plasmalemma vesicle associated protein) protein has been shown to be necessary for the formation of diaphragms. The expression, subcellular localization and fenestra-forming role of PLVAP in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) have remained controversial. Here we show that fenestrations in LSEC contain PLVAP-diaphragms during the fetal angiogenesis, but they lose the diaphragms at birth. Although it is thought that PLVAP only localizes to diaphragms, we found luminal localization of PLVAP in adult LSEC using several imaging techniques. Plvap-deficient mice revealed that the absence of PLVAP and diaphragms did not affect the morphology, the number of fenestrations or the overall vascular architecture in the liver sinusoids. Nevertheless, PLVAP in fetal LSEC (fenestrations with diaphragms) associated with LYVE-1 (lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1), neuropilin-1 and VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2), whereas in the adult LSEC (fenestrations without diaphragms) these complexes disappeared. Collectively, our data show that PLVAP can be expressed on endothelial cells without diaphragms, contradict the prevailing concept that biogenesis of fenestrae would be PLVAP-dependent, and reveal previously unknown PLVAP-dependent molecular complexes in LSEC during angiogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646089>Dexamethasone differentially depletes tumour and peripheral blood lymphocytes and can impact the efficacy of chemotherapy/checkpoint blockade combination treatment.</a></h2><p>Dexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid commonly used for the prevention and management of side effects in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. While it is effective as an anti-emetic and in preventing hypersensitivity reactions, dexamethasone depletes peripheral blood lymphocytes and impacts immune responses. The effect of dexamethasone on the number and quality of tumour-infiltrating leukocytes has not been reported. To address this, we calibrated the dose in two different strains of mice to achieve the same extent of peripheral blood lymphocyte depletion observed in patients with cancer. Doses that caused analogous depletion of T and B lymphocytes and NK cells from the peripheral blood, elicited no change in these populations within the tumour. The expression of immune checkpoint molecules PD-1, OX40, GITR and TIM3 on tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes was not altered. We found that dexamethasone had a small but significant deleterious impact on weakly efficacious chemoimmunotherapy but had no effect when the protocol was highly efficacious. Based on these results, we predict that dexamethasone will have a modest negative influence on the overall effectiveness of chemoimmunotherapy treatment.© 2019 The Author(s).

Poor DC development can limit the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade and  vaccination approaches. Interference in intracellular signaling cascades downstream from the receptors of major tumor-associated suppressive cytokines like IL-10 and IL-6, might improve DC development and activation, and thus enhance  efficacy. We performed exploratory functional screens on arrays consisting of >1000 human kinase peptide substrates to identify pathways involved in DC development and its inhibition by IL-10 or IL-6. The resulting alterations in phosphorylation of the kinome substrate profile pointed to glycogen-synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) as a pivotal kinase in both DC development and suppression. GSK3β inhibition blocked human DC differentiation , which was accompanied by decreased levels of IL-12p70 secretion, and a reduced capacity for T cell priming. More importantly, adenoviral transduction of monocytes with a constitutively active form of GSK3β induced resistance to the suppressive effects of IL-10 and melanoma-derived supernatants alike, resulting in improved DC development, accompanied by up-regulation of co-stimulatory markers, an increase in CD83 expression levels in mature DC, and diminished release of IL-10. Moreover, adenovirus-mediated intratumoral manipulation of this pathway in an  melanoma model resulted in DC activation and recruitment, and in improved immune surveillance and tumor control. We propose the induction of constitutive GSK3β activity as a novel therapeutic means to bolster DC functionality in the tumor microenvironment.© 2019 The Author(s).

Mismatch repair protein expression was uniformly intact in all cases of bladder adenocarcinoma, in comparison with 19% of advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma being mismatch repair deficient. This finding indicates that mismatch repair proteins may be combined with β-catenin and GATA-3 to create an immunostaining panel which, in addition to clinical studies, can aid in distinguishing bladder adenocarcinoma from secondary involvement by colorectal carcinoma. 4% of cases were found to overexpress PD-L1 in tumor cells while approximately a third of cases were found to display PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating immune cells. These results indicate hypermutators are likely rare in bladder adenocarcinoma, yet 20-30% of the patients may be eligible for immune checkpoint blockade therapy.Copyright © 2019.

In the past, drugs produced to block the early inflammatory response had little effect on reversing the development of sepsis. Recent studies have shown that the mortality and prognosis of patients are significantly correlated with the immunosuppression of sepsis and the overexpression of co-inhibitory molecules. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is a recently focused co-inhibitory molecule, which can regulate the functions of a variety of immune cells and participate in innate immunity and acquired immunity. It has important value in risk stratification and prognosis prediction of patients with sepsis, and can be used as one of the intervention targets for immune regulation in sepsis in the future. The role of PD-1 signaling pathway in immunosuppression and its effect on patients' prognosis is reviewed in this article, providing new directions for the treatment of sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652572>Screening a Broad Range of Solid and Haematological Tumour Types for CD70 Expression Using a Uniform IHC Methodology as Potential Patient Stratification Method.</a></h2><p>The constitutive expression of CD70 has been described in various haematological and solid tumour types. In addition, the co-expression of its receptor in tumours has been demonstrated, mediating tumour cell proliferation. Although CD70 expression is a prerequisite to enrol patients in solid tumour clinical trials using anti-CD70 , there is currently no standardised test to evaluate CD70 expression. These differences in immunohistochemistry (IHC) protocols make it challenging to compare the expression levels that were obtained in different studies, pointing out the need for one uniform methodology. In this retrospective study, over 600 tumour samples from different solid and haematological malignancies were analysed while using one validated IHC method. CD70 and CD27 expression was demonstrated in a broad range of tumour types. In solid tumours, 43% demonstrated CD70 positivity with the highest degree in renal cell carcinoma (79.5%). Kaposi sarcoma showed no CD70 expression on the tumour cells. In lymphoma samples, 58% demonstrated CD70 positivity. Moreover, the co-expression of CD70 and CD27 was observed in 39% of lymphoma samples. These findings highlight the need to further explore anti-CD70 therapies in a broad range of CD70 expressing tumour types and in doing so, implementing one standardised protocol to define CD70 overexpression to use it as a diagnostic tool.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661153> in Colorectal Cancer.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer deaths, with only 15% of patients surviving 5 years in the metastatic setting.

Although CRC has been shown to evade immune detection like many other cancers do,  has been noted to produce some very impressive results in a select group of patients. Patients with mismatch repair-deficient and microsatellite instability-high type CRC have benefited most from recent  approaches, leading to US Food and Drug Administration approval of new immunotherapeutic agents in recurrent refractory metastatic disease. Research continues to explore and hopefully define the role of  in CRC as single-agent therapy or in combination with other agents in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and first-line metastatic setting, and to find the optimal combination and sequencing of this new therapeutic approach. One of the most challenging tasks is to find ways to expand the use of  to not only a select group of CRC patients but also to all patients with this disease.

However, there are two main challenges in successfully utilizing macrophages for . First, macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF) secreted by cancer cells binds to colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1-R) on macrophages and in turn activates the downstream signaling pathway responsible for polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to immunosuppressive M2 phenotype. Second, ligation of signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) expressed on myeloid cells to CD47, a transmembrane protein overexpressed on cancer cells, activates the Src homology region 2 (SH2) domain -phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 in macrophages. This results in activation of "eat-me-not" signaling pathway and inhibition of phagocytosis. Here, it is reported that self-assembled dual-inhibitor-loaded nanoparticles (DNTs) target M2 macrophages and simultaneously inhibit CSF1R and SHP2 pathways. This results in efficient repolarization of M2 macrophages to an active M1 phenotype, and superior phagocytic capabilities as compared to individual drug treatments. Furthermore, suboptimal dose administration of DNTs in highly aggressive breast cancer and melanoma mouse models show enhanced anti-tumor efficacy without any toxicity.

Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells are crucial for the rejection of established tumors. We constructed XCL1-GPC3 fusion molecules as a liver cancer vaccine by linking the XCL1 chemokine to glypican-3 (GPC3), which is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cells expressing XCL1-GPC3 chemoattracted murine XCR1+CD8α+DCs and human XCR1+CD141+DCs in vitro and promoted their IL-12 production. After subcutaneous mXcl1-GPC3 plasmid injection, mXCL1-GPC3 was mainly detected in CD8α+DCs of mouse draining lymph nodes. XCL1-GPC3-targeted DCs enhanced antigen-specific CD8+ T cell-proliferation and induced the de novo generation of GPC3-specific CD8+ T cells, which abolished GPC3-expressing tumor cells in mouse and human systems. We immunized a murine autochthonous liver cancer model, with a hepatitis B background, with the mXcl1-GPC3 plasmid starting six weeks, when malignant hepatocyte clusters formed, or 14 weeks, when liver tumor nodules developed, after diethylnitrosamine administration. mXcl1-GPC3 immunized mice displayed significantly inhibited tumor formation and growth compared to GPC3-immunized mice. After mXcl1-GPC3 immunization, mouse livers showed elevated production of IFNγ, granzyme B, IL-18, CCL5, CXCL19, Xcl1, and increased infiltration of GPC3-specific CD8+ T cells, activated NK cells and NKT cells. The antitumor effects of these immune cells were further enhanced by the administration of anti-PD1. Anti-HCC effects induced by hXCL1-GPC3 were confirmed in HCC-PDX model from three patients.

In contrast, tumor cells highly express PD-L1, which binds to receptor PD-1 expressed on activated T cells, leading to immune escape. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint therapy blocks the binding of PD-1/PD-L1 to reinvigorate the exhausted T cells, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. Exosomes are biologically active lipid-bilayer nanovesicles secreted by various cell types that mediate intercellular signal communication. Numerous studies have shown that tumor cells are able to promote tumor epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and immune escape by releasing exosomes. Recent studies imply that tumor-derived exosomes could carry PD-L1 in the same membrane topology as the cell surface, thereby resisting immune checkpoint therapy. In this review, we mainly discuss the role of exosomes in the regulation of tumor progression and the potential resistance mechanism to  via exosomal PD-L1.

Building on previous analyses (2) and using the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) global vaccination coverage estimates as of 2018, this report presents global, regional, and national vaccination coverage estimates and trends, including vaccination dropout rates. According to these estimates, global coverage with the first dose of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis-containing vaccine (DTP1) remained relatively unchanged from 2010 (89%) to 2018 (90%). Global coverage with the third DTP dose (DTP3) followed a similar global trend to that of DTP1, remaining relatively consistent from 2010 (84%) to 2018 (86%) (3). Globally, 19.4 million children (14%) were not fully vaccinated in 2018, and among them, 13.5 million (70%) did not receive any DTP doses. Overall, dropout rates from DTP1 to DTP3 decreased globally from 6% in 2010 to 4% in 2018. Global coverage with the first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) remained between 84% and 86% during 2010-2018. Among countries that offer a second MCV dose (MCV2) during the second year of life, coverage increased from 19% in 2007 to 54% in 2018; among countries offering MCV2 to older age groups (children aged 3-14 years), coverage also increased, from 36% in 2007 to 69% in 2018 (3). Globally, the estimated difference in coverage with MCV1 and MCV2 in 2018 was 17%. However, among new and underused vaccines, global coverage increased from 2007 to 2018 for completed series of rotavirus vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), rubella vaccine, Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib), and hepatitis B vaccine (HepB).

However, the clinical symptoms (psychiatric disorders, cognitive decline) and signs (consciousness disturbance) at onset and after follow-up were not significantly different (P > 0.05). In 71.4% of the patients, anti-GABABR antibody serum levels were higher than those in the cerebrospinal fluid (especially in patients with lung cancer). Magnetic resonance imaging in 71.4% of patients indicated that the marginal lobe demonstrated encephalitis lesions. The average modified Rankin Scale score (2.0 ± 2.31) at follow-up was significantly better than that (3.86 ± 0.90) at the time of admission (P < 0.05).The clinical characteristics of anti-GABABR encephalitis were refractory epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive impairment.

Thus, its natural history is not well defined and treatment recommendations come from small retrospective studies. Data on managing PTFL with radiation therapy alone is particularly sparse. Here, we describe a 17 year-old male who presented in June 2017 with a slowly enlarging right-sided cervical neck mass. An initial core biopsy was performed which showed reactive follicular hyperplasia. Four months later, the mass had enlarged significantly and an excision biopsy again showed reactive follicular hyperplasia. Further excision of five cervical lymph-nodes revealed expanded follicles with attenuated mantle-zones. Follicles were composed of medium sized atypical lymphoid cells; centroblasts were increased. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated follicles with cells expressing CD20, CD10, PAX-5, OCT-2, BOB-1 and BCL-6; Cyclin D1 was negative. MIB-1 was greater than 90% in follicles. Polymerase chain reaction analysis identified a clonal B-cell profile. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization did not detect t(14;18), BCL2 or BCL6 rearrangement and breaks in IRF-4/DUSP22 and MYC were not detected. These findings were in keeping with a diagnosis of PTFL. PET/CT imaging confirmed disease isolated to the right neck, but unfortunately unresectable due to anatomic location. The patient declined treatment with chemo- and was thus treated with local radiotherapy, which was well tolerated. He achieved a complete response and remains in remission six months later.

Indeed, the tumor microenvironment has an almost full immunosuppressive profile, creating an obstacle to therapeutic treatment. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) governs a plethora of cellular processes, including maintenance of genomic stability, cell survival/apoptosis, migration, and metabolism.

It is an overwhelming task to discover drug-like inhibitors of glycosyl transferases that block the synthesis of specific branching processes in cancer cells, killing tumor cells selectively. It has long been known that -glycan biosynthesis can be inhibited by disruption of the first committed enzyme, dolichyl-phosphate -acetylglucosaminephosphotransferase 1 (DPAGT1). Selective DPAGT1 inhibitors have the promising therapeutic potential for certain solid cancers that require increased branching of -linked glycans in their growth progressions. Recently, we discovered that an anti- molecule, aminouridyl phenoxypiperidinbenzyl butanamide (APPB) showed DPAGT1 inhibitory activity with the IC value of 0.25 μM. It was confirmed that APPB inhibits -glycosylation of β-catenin at 2.5 nM concentration. A sharp difference between APPB and tunicamycin was that the hemolytic activity of APPB is significantly attenuated (IC > 200 μM RBC). Water solubility of APPB is >350-times greater than that of tunicamycin (78.8 mg/mL for APPB, <0.2 mg/mL for tunicamycin). A novel DPAGT1 inhibitor, APPB selectively inhibits growth of the solid tumors (.

However, even when pathologic disease-free margins can be achieved, locoregional and/or distant disease relapse remains high. Perioperative  may improve outcomes, but mechanistic data supporting the use of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment clinically is sparse.Two syngeneic models of oral cavity carcinoma with defined T cell antigens were treated with PD-1 mAb before or after surgical resection of primary tumors, and antigen-specific T cell responses were explored with functional and challenge assays.We demonstrated that functional immunodominance developed among T cells targeting multiple independent tumor antigens. T cells specific for subdominant antigens expressed greater levels of PD-1. Neoadjuvant, but not adjuvant, PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade broke immunodominance and induced T cell responses to dominant and subdominant antigens. Using tumors lacking the immunodominant antigen as a model of antigen escape, neoadjuvant PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade induced effector T cell immunity against tumor cells lacking immunodominant but retaining subdominant antigen. When combined with complete surgical excision, neoadjuvant PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade led to formation of immunologic memory capable of preventing engraftment of tumors lacking the immunodominant but retaining subdominant antigen.Together, these results implicate PD-1 expression by T cells in the mechanism of functional immunodominance among independent T cell clones within a progressing tumor, and support the use of neoadjuvant PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade in patients with surgically resectable carcinomas.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649385>Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in malignant melanoma - allies or foes?</a></h2><p>This is an overview of current problematics regarding the role of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in malignant melanomas.

Recently, however, advances in lung cancer treatment have improved the chance of long-term survival of patients with unresectable distant metastases. We describe the occurrence and management of metastatic spread of a pulmonary carcinoma to the rectum.The patient was a 79-year-old woman who had undergone thoracoscopic left lobectomy for pulmonary adenocarcinoma and then, over the next 11 years, various drugs (carboplatin + paclitaxel (as adjuvant therapy), gefitinib, gemcitabine + vinorelbine, S1 (an oral 5-fluorouracil-based drug), carboplatin + pemetrexed + bevacizumab, erlotinib, nivolumab, afatinib, and carboplatin+ S1) were administered, especially for hilar and mediastinal lymph node recurrences. During the eleventh postoperative year, left and right iliac bone metastases were detected, and radiation therapy was undertaken for local control of these lesions. When F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography was performed for evaluation of the disease, tracer accumulation in the upper rectum was seen. Colonoscopic examination of the rectum revealed an intramural mass with central ulceration, and the mass was diagnosed histologically as an adenocarcinoma. The bone metastases appeared to be controlled, and the patient's performance status was good, but she had suffered constipation for about a year and desired treatment. Thus, laparoscopic low anterior resection was performed. Histopathologic analysis revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma existing mainly between the submucosa and serosa, and immunohistochemical analysis showed the tumor to be positive for cytokeratin (CK) 7, negative for CK20, positive for thyroid transcription factor-1, and negative for special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 and caudal type homeobox 2, confirming the diagnosis of rectal metastasis from the primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma. The patient recovered well without any change in her functional status. Systemic chemotherapy was resumed, and she continues to do well, now 6 months after surgery.Surgery may be a good option for the management of an isolated rectal metastasis from pulmonary cancer in patients whose functional status is good.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642039>Overview of Staphylococcus epidermidis cell wall-anchored proteins: potential targets to inhibit biofilm formation.</a></h2><p>Currently, the treatment of infections by Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) represents a challenge because some strains have multidrug-resistance to antimicrobial products (antibiotic and biocides) and can produce biofilms. These biofilms protect bacterial cells from both antimicrobials and the host immune response. Therefore, it is crucial to encourage research on the development of new treatments. One method is , targeting components of S. epidermidis, such as S. epidermidis surface (Ses) proteins. Ses is expressed constitutively in most strains, and they participate in biofilm formation.

While better peri-operative strategies, increased number of cytotoxic agents and availability of targeted therapies have improved survival, there remains an unmet need for novel treatment approaches. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have marked a new era in cancer management with unprecedented results in several malignancies. Although OGC lagged behind other solid tumours, evidence has increasingly accumulated supporting the contention that modulation of the anti-cancer host immune response may be beneficial for at least some patients. Many trials have been completed in Eastern and Western countries, some of these leading to the approval of ICIs in the refractory setting, and favorable opinion from regulatory agencies is expected also in treatment-naïve, advanced OGC. Furthermore, studies are evaluating ICIs in the early stage setting and exploring the potential of combination treatments. In this article we discuss the biological bases underlying the successful development of ICIs in OGC and review the available data on PD-1 and PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies in this disease. Also, we present ongoing clinical trials of these ICIs that could shape the future treatment landscape of OGC.Copyright © 2019.

We aimed to study the progress made in this area.A mini-review was achieved using the articles published in Web of Science and PubMed in the last year and the new patents made in this field. Results and future directions: The responses to CAR T-cell products axicabtagene ciloleucel and tisagenlecleucel are encouraging; the objective response rate can reach up to 83%, and the complete response rate ranges between 40 and 58%. About half of the patients may have serious side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. Current and future developments include the improvement of CAR T-cell expansion and polyfunctionality, the combined use of CAR T-cells with a fusion protein between interferon and an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, with checkpoint inhibitors or small molecule sensitizers that have apoptotic-regulatory effects.

However, there are still no effective vaccines for many serious and potentially preventable infectious diseases. Advances in vaccine technology, including new delivery methods and adjuvants, as well as progress in systems biology and an increased understanding of the human immune system, hold the potential to address these issues. In addition, maternal immunization has opened an avenue to address infectious diseases in neonates and very young infants.

Recent efforts have focused on identifying clinically relevant subgroups to improve our understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms and patient stratification. Concurrently, the role of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment has received increasing attention, especially T cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). The latter are a mixed population of activated brain-resident microglia and infiltrating monocytes/monocyte-derived macrophages, both of which express ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA1). This study investigated differences in immune cell subpopulations among distinct transcriptional subtypes of GBM. Human GBM samples were molecularly characterized and assigned to Proneural, Mesenchymal or Classical subtypes as defined by NanoString nCounter Technology. Subsequently, we performed and analyzed automated immunohistochemical stainings for TAM as well as specific T cell populations. The Mesenchymal subtype of GBM showed the highest presence of TAM, CD8, CD3 and FOXP3 T cells, as compared to Proneural and Classical subtypes. High expression levels of the TAM-related gene , which encodes the TAM-specific protein IBA1, correlated with a worse prognosis in Proneural GBM, but conferred a survival benefit in Mesenchymal tumors. We used our data to construct a mathematical model that could reliably identify Mesenchymal GBM with high sensitivity using a combination of the aforementioned cell-specific IHC markers.

The combination of quercetin (Q) and alantolactone (A) was found to induce synergistic immunogenic cell death (ICD) at a molar ratio of 1:4 (Q:A). To achieve ratiometric loading and delivery, the micellar delivery of Q and A (QA-M) was developed with high entrapment efficiency and drug loading at an optimal ratio. QA-M achieved prolonged blood circulation and increased tumor accumulation for both drugs. More importantly, QA-M retained the desired drug ratio (molar ratio of Q to A = 1:4) in tumors at 2 and 4 h after intravenous injection for synergistic . Tumor growth was significantly inhibited in murine orthotopic CRC by the treatment of QA-M compared to PBS and the combination of free drugs ( < 0.005). The combination of nanotherapy stimulated the host immune response to induce long-term tumor destruction and induced memory tumor surveillance with a 1.3-fold increase in survival median time compared to PBS ( < 0.0001) and a combination of free drugs ( < 0.0005). The synergistic therapeutic effect induced by codelivery of Q and A is capable of reactivating antitumor immunity by inducing ICD, causing cell toxicity and modulating the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment. Such a combination of Q and A with synergistic effects entrapped in a simple and safe nanodelivery system may provide the potential for scale-up manufacturing and clinical applications as immunotherapeutic agents for CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647950>Passive immunotherapies targeting amyloid beta and tau oligomers in Alzheimer's disease.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is historically difficult to treat, in part due the inaccessible nature of brain pathology. Amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau proteins drive pathology by forming toxic oligomers that eventually deposit as insoluble amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Recent clinical studies suggest that effective drugs must specifically target oligomers, not native monomers or insoluble fibrils. Passive  is one promising pharmaceutical strategy used to specifically target these oligomers in situ. Using the specificity of antibodies coupled with the natural power of the body's immune response, this treatment provides an opportunity for safe clearance of pathogenic protein species from the brain. Passive immunotherapies against Aβ and tau oligomers have progressed to clinical trials, with many currently in progress. Biochemical studies of antibody-oligomer complexes have helped identify previously unknown toxic epitopes, thus providing knowledge to the AD field as a whole. This mini-review focuses on the efforts to develop passive  treatments for AD and discusses the knowledge gained from recent failures and clinical trials in progress.Copyright © 2019.

Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) is detectable during homeostasis and increases in hypoplasia due to genetic defects or treatment with cytoreductive agents. Conversely, Flt3+ AML is associated with depletion of Flt3L to undetectable levels. After induction chemotherapy, Flt3L is restored in patients entering complete remission (CR) but remains depressed in those with refractory disease. Weekly sampling reveals marked differences in the kinetics of Flt3L response during the first 6 weeks of treatment, proportionate to the clearance of blasts and cellularity of the bone marrow. In the UK NCRI AML17 trial, Flt3L was measured at day 26 in a subgroup of 140 patients with Flt3 mutation randomized to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lestaurtinib or placebo. In these patients, attainment of CR was associated with higher Flt3L at day 26 (Mann-Whitney UP < .0001). Day 26 Flt3L was also associated with survival; Flt3L ≤291 pg/mL was associated with inferior event-free survival (EFS), and Flt3L >1185 pg/mL was associated with higher overall survival (OS; P = .0119). The separation of EFS and OS curves increased when minimal residual disease (MRD) status was combined with Flt3L measurement, and Flt3L retained a near-significant association with survival after adjusting for MRD in a proportional hazards model. Serial measurement of Flt3L in patients who had received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant for AML illustrates the potential value of monitoring Flt3L to identify relapse. Measurement of Flt3L is a noninvasive test with the potential to inform clinical decisions in patients with AML.© 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644929>The superior efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1  in KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer that correlates with an inflammatory phenotype and increased immunogenicity.</a></h2><p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors against PD-1/PD-L1 yield improved survival rates of KRAS-mutant NSCLC patients, who conferred a poor prognosis without effective targeted therapy until now. Yet, the underlying association between KRAS mutations and immune responses remains unclear. We performed an integrated analysis of the data from publicly available repositories and from clinical center cohorts to explore the association between KRAS mutation status and tumor immunity-associated features, including PD-L1 expression, CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tumor mutational burden (TMB). Our results revealed that KRAS mutations are correlated with an inflammatory tumor microenvironment and tumor immunogenicity, resulting in superior patient response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Meanwhile, three-pool analysis further confirmed that KRAS-mutant NSCLC patients show remarkable clinical benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 . In addition, a KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma mouse model was established to estimate the relative efficacy of anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody monotherapy or combination treatment with docetaxel versus docetaxel alone. Most surprisingly, we found that PD-L1 blockade combined with docetaxel did not promote an anti-tumor response. These findings uncover that PD-1/PD-L1 blockade monotherapy may be the optimal therapeutic schedule in NSCLC patients harboring KRAS mutations.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Epigenetic therapies such as BET Bromodomain inhibition can change the transcriptome of tumor cells, possibly making them more immunogenic and thus susceptible to immune targeting.We characterized the effects of BET bromodomain inhibition using JQ1 on PD-L1 and HLA-ABC expression in two human prostate cell lines, DU145 and PC3. RNA-Seq was performed to assess changes on a genome-wide level. A cytotoxic T cell killing assay was performed in MC38-OVA cells treated with JQ1 to demonstrate increased immunogenicity. In vivo experiments in the Myc-Cap model were conducted to show the effects of JQ1 administration in concert with anti-CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade.Here, we show that targeting BET bromodomains using the small molecule inhibitor JQ1 decreased PD-L1 expression and mitigated tumor progression in prostate cancer models. Mechanistically, BET bromodomain inhibition increased MHC I expression and increased the immunogenicity of tumor cells. Transcriptional profiling showed that BET bromodomain inhibition regulates distinct networks of antigen processing and immune checkpoint molecules. In murine models, treatment with JQ1 was additive with anti-CTLA-4 , resulting in an increased CD8/Treg ratio.BET Bromodomain inhibition can mediate changes in expression at a genome wide level in prostate cancer cells, resulting in an increased susceptibility to CD8 T cell targeting. These data suggest that combining BET bromodomain inhibition with immune checkpoint blockade may have clinical activity in prostate cancer patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646092>Immune checkpoint inhibitors in mCRPC - rationales, challenges and perspectives.</a></h2><p>The advancement of immune-therapeutics in cancer treatment has proven to be promising in various malignant diseases.

TAMs are predominantly polarized to a pro-tumorigenic M2-phenotype through macrophage colony stimulating factor 1 (MCSF) cytokines that bind to the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), a class III receptor tyrosine kinase. This MCSF-CSF1R interaction results in autophosphorylation of CSF1R and subsequent phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway leading to proliferation, survival and functional activity of M2 TAMs. Therapeutic inhibition of CSF1R and MAPK signaling could effectively re-polarize M2 macrophages to an anti-tumorigenic M1 phenotype; however, this is challenging. In this study, we demonstrate that concurrent and sustained inhibition of the CSF1R and MAPK signaling pathways using dual-kinase inhibitor-loaded supramolecular nanoparticles (DSNs) enhance repolarization of pro-tumorigenic M2 macrophages to the anti-tumorigenic M1 phenotype. The supramolecular nanoparticles exhibited physical stability of over 7 days during storage conditions at 4 °C and over 24 h in human serum, released the inhibitors in a sustained manner and showed significantly higher internalization and accumulation of inhibitors in the M2 macrophages even at longer time points. When tested in a highly aggressive 4T1 breast cancer model, the supramolecular nanoparticles accumulated in TAMs at a significantly higher concentration, increased M1-like phenotype at significantly higher proportion and improved anti-tumor efficacy as compared to combination of single-inhibitor nanoparticles or the small molecule inhibitors. Our data suggests that concurrent, vertical inhibition of multiple intracellular kinase signaling pathways is important for repolarization of M2 macrophages to M1 phenotype, and by utilizing dual-inhibitor loaded supramolecular nanoparticles, further increase the ability to produce more M1 macrophages as compared to M2 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. This results in enhanced tumor growth inhibition and reduced toxicity. Therefore, vertical, co-inhibition of CSF1R and downstream signaling pathways like MAPK could be a promising macrophage  strategy for aggressive cancers.Copyright © 2019.

However, most protocols developed to expand T cells require relatively long periods of time in culture, potentially leading to progression toward populations of terminally differentiated effector memory cells. Here, we describe in detail a 9-day protocol for CAR gene transduction and expansion of primary rhesus macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Cells produced and expanded with this method show high levels of viability, high levels of co-expression of two transduced genes, retention of the central memory phenotype, and sufficient quantity for immunotherapeutic infusion of 1-2 × 10 cells/kg in a 10 kg rhesus macaque.

AIT is usually delivered by sublingual, subcutaneous route. Both sublingual  (SLIT) and subcutaneous  (SCIT) are given at increasing doses in the build-up phase and then at maintenance dose. The allergen dose is regularly administered throughout the year or pre/co-seasonally, depending on the causal allergen and the type of allergen extract. AIT with one or multiple allergens currently represents the only causal treatment able to change the natural history of allergic airways diseases (1). Significant progresses have been made in terms of AIT efficacy and safety since the first report of the treatment of hay-fever by SCIT using pollen extracts, described by Noon and Freeman in 1911 (2; 3). The first randomized study on SLIT dates back to 1986 (4). Several placebo-controlled studies on AIT in the subsequent years have allowed systematic reviews suggesting evidence for improvement of symptoms and reduction of medication use for both allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma (5). However, AIT remains underused since interpretation of evidence remains challenging for heterogeneity among studied populations, selection of potential responders, outcomes, regimens and products for AIT. Moreover, the use of AIT is hampered by fluctuating availability of AIT products, different educational level of physicians and lack of consciousness of AIT in the general population (6).Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670092>Traf6 inhibitor boosts antitumor immunity by impeding regulatory T cell migration in Hepa1-6 tumor model.</a></h2><p>Tumors escape immune attacks via various mechanisms, among which activation of regulatory pathways in effector immune cells and recruitment of immunosuppressive cells are usually employed. Traf6 is a member of the family of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors and involved in many signaling pathways. While it plays important roles in both tumor biology and immune system, the potential therapeutic role of Traf6 in tumor  hasn't ever been assessed. Here, we confirmed the anti-tumor effect of Traf6 inhibitor in Hepa1-6 tumor model. Flow cytometry-based analysis revealed that T cell-mediated antitumor immunity was provoked and the infiltration of Treg cells was restrained when treated with Traf6 inhibitor. Via an in vivo migration assay, we found that Traf6 inhibitor decreased the population of intratumor Tregs by impeding the migration of Tregs towards tumor. Finally, we demonstrated that combination of Traf6 inhibitor and PD-1 blockade could receive a better antitumor efficiency. These results implicated that Traf6 inhibitor could serve as a supplement for immune checkpoint therapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Light-activated components in nanosystems confer additional phototherapeutic effects as combinatorial modalities; however, systemic and thermal toxicities with unfavorable accumulation and excretion of nanoystem components now hamper their practical applications. Thus, there remains a need for optimal multifunctional nanosystems to enhance targeted, durable, and mild combination therapies for efficient cancer treatment without notable side effects.

As an alternative for the traditional tripartite treatment options of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy,  is gaining increasing attention due to the opportunity of more targeted approaches. Promising targets are antigen-presenting cells which drive innate and adaptive immune responses. The discovery and emergence of new drugs and lead structures can be inspired by natural products which comprise many highly bioactive molecules. The development of new drugs based on natural products is hampered by the current lack of guidelines for screening these structures for immune activating compounds. In this work, we describe a phenotypic preclinical screening pipeline for first-line identification of promising natural products using the mouse as a model system. Favorable compounds are defined to be non-toxic to immune target cells, to show direct anti-tumor effects and to be immunostimulatory at the same time. The presented screening pipeline constitutes a useful tool and aims to integrate immune activation in experimental approaches early on in drug discovery. It supports the selection of natural products for later chemical optimization, direct application in in vivo mouse models and clinical trials and promotes the emergence of new innovative drugs for cancer treatment.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this study, we showed that Lachnum polysaccharide (LEP) could work as an immunomodulator to reset TAMs from pro-tumor M2 to anti-tumor M1 phenotype. Mechanistically, LEP promoted Th1 polarization and the secretion of IFN-γ, which played a key role in M1 phenotype polarization. In parallel, LEP might directly activate M1 macrophages via TLR4 mediated NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, LEP also resulted in the accumulation of anti-tumor immune cells and decrease the infiltration of immunosuppressive cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and Treg cells, thereby potentiating anti-tumor immunity. In summary, these results revealed a novel mechanism of the anti-tumor effect of LEP and provided a potential new avenue targeting TAMs and cancer .Copyright © 2019.

Targeting interleukin-2 (IL2) receptors on activated T-cells using positron emission tomography (PET) with N-(4-[F]fluorobenzoyl)-interleukin-2 ([F]FB-IL2) could be such a strategy. This paper describes the challenging translation of the partly manual labeling of [F]FB-IL2 for preclinical studies into an automated procedure following Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), resulting in a radiopharmaceutical suitable for clinical use.The preclinical synthesis of [F]FB-IL2 was the starting point for translation to a clinical production method. To overcome several challenges, major adaptations in the production process were executed. The final analytical methods and production method were validated and documented. All data with regards to the quality and safety of the final drug product were documented in an investigational medicinal product dossier.Restrictions in the [F]FB-IL2 production were imposed by hardware configuration of the automated synthesis equipment and by use of disposable cassettes. Critical steps in the [F]FB-IL2 production comprised the purification method, stability of recombinant human IL2 and the final formulation. With the GMP compliant production method, [F]FB-IL2 could reliably be produced with consistent quality complying to all specifications.To enable the use of [F]FB-IL2 in clinical studies, a fully automated GMP compliant production process was developed.

However, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) also shows favorable outcomes. Although the immunological environment of RC has been thoroughly discussed, the effect of NAC on it is less clear. Here, we investigated the immunological microenvironment, including T-cell infiltration, activation, and topological distribution, of resected RC tissue after neoadjuvant therapies and evaluated the correlation between T-cell subsets and patient prognosis. RC patients (n = 188) were enrolled and categorized into three groups, namely CRT (n = 41), NAC (n = 46), and control (surgery alone; n = 101) groups. Characterization of residual carcinoma cells and T-cell subsets in resected tissues was performed using multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry. The densities of total and activated (Ki67 ) T-cells in tissues after NAC, but not CRT, were higher than in control. In both CRT and NAC groups, patients presenting with higher treatment effects showed aggressive infiltration of T-cell subsets into carcinomas. Multivariate analyses of pathological and immunological features and prognosis revealed that carcinoma Ki67 CD4 T-cells after CRT and stromal Ki67 CD8 T-cells after NAC are important prognostic factors, respectively. Our results suggest that evaluation of T-cell activation with Ki67 expression and its tumor localization can be used to determine the prognosis of advanced RC after neoadjuvant therapies.© 2019 The Authors.

The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multi-protein complex of the innate immune system that is responsible for the production of the potent inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Tumor- associated macrophages (TAM) are an expanded population of immune cells found in the tumor microenvironment that can promote the initiation and metastasis of tumor cells. Their presence has been correlated with disease burden, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting this population. However, to date clinically relevant pharmacologic strategies to target TAM remain elusive. Here, we show that  generated TAM harbor NLRP3 inflammasome components and produce IL-1β. Ibrutinib, an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), is in clinical use for the treatment of B- cell malignancies. We report that BTK is expressed by human  generated TAM and murine macrophages and that it physically associates with the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, ibrutinib is able to inhibit BTK phosphorylation in TAM generated . Treatment of TAM with ibrutinib significantly impaired the ability of these cells to produce IL-1β. The present study provides evidence that BTK physically associates with the NLRP3 inflammasome and that inhibition of BTK with ibrutinib can impair the production of IL-1β by  generated TAM. Thus, ibrutinib could potentially be of clinical use in abrogating inflammation-associated cancer progression and the immune-suppressive effects of myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment.© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646091>Clinical impact of T cells, B cells and the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in muscle invasive bladder cancer: a comparative study of transurethral resection and cystectomy specimens.</a></h2><p>In patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) prior to radical cystectomy has improved survival but there is an urgent unmet need to identify prognostic and predictive biomarkers to stratify patients who will benefit from treatment. This study aimed to examine the composition of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in MIBC, with particular reference to the clinical outcome and the potential modifying effect of NAC. To this end, the expression of CD8 and FoxP3 T cells, CD20 B cells, PD-1 and PD-L1 immune cells and PD-L1 tumor cells was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays with paired transurethral resection (TURB) specimens, cystectomy specimens and lymph node metastases from 145 patients, 65 of whom had received NAC. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were applied to assess the impact of investigated cell subsets on time to recurrence (TTR). In cystectomy specimens, high infiltration of the investigated immune cell populations, but not PD-L1 tumor cells, were independently associated with a prolonged TTR, whereas in TURB specimens, this association was only seen for CD8 lymphocytes. An additive beneficial prognostic effect of NAC was seen for the majority of the cell subsets but there was no significant interaction between any immune marker and NAC in relation to TTR. Furthermore, no differences in cell densities prior to NAC treatment were observed between complete and non-complete responders, or pre- and posttreatment in non-complete responders. In conclusion, immune cell infiltration provides important prognostic information in both pre- and postsurgical samples of MIBC, independently of NAC.© 2019 The Author(s).

Acidic extracellular pH is a major attribute of the tumor microenvironment (TME) that promotes immune evasion and tumor progression. Therefore, antagonizing tumor acidity can be a powerful approach in cancer . Here, Pluronic F-127 is used as a NaHCO releasing carrier to focally alleviate extracellular tumor acidity. In a mouse tumor model, intratumoral treatment with pH modulating injectable gel (pH-MIG) generates immune-favorable TME, as evidenced by the decrease of immune-suppressive cells and increase of tumor infiltrating CD8 + T cells. The combination of pH-MIG with immune checkpoint inhibitors, anti-PD-1 and anti-TIGIT antibodies, increases intratumoral T cell function, which leads to tumor clearance. Mechanistically, extracellular acidity was shown to upregulate co-inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors and inhibit mTOR signaling pathways in memory CD8 + T cells, which impaired effector functions. Furthermore, an acidic pH environment increased the expression and engagement of TIGIT and its ligand CD155, which suggested that the extracellular pH can regulate the suppressive function of TIGIT pathway. Collectively, these findings suggest that pH-MIG holds potential as a new TME modulator for effective immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies.Copyright © 2019.

This synthetic pyrazolone derivative is a potent scavenger of oxygen free radicals and also functions as a modulator of transcription factors, repressing NFκB and activating Nrf2, to regulate oxidative stress. EDA displays complementary anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. The injectable small molecule is currently investigated for the treatment of several non-neurological diseases. The potential interest of EDA in oncology is reviewed here. EDA is a mild antiproliferative agent but has been found to enhance significantly the anticancer and antimetastatic activities of irinotecan in a colon cancer model. Anticancer derivatives of EDA have been designed but they generally display a limited antiproliferative activity. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of EDA can be best exploited to protect non-tumor cells from damages induced by chemotherapeutic drugs and radiations. Notably EDA can reduce the renal dysfunction induced by cisplatin, the neurotoxicity of cyclophosphamide and the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin. Upon treatment with EDA, a significant improvement in neurologic symptoms has been observed in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy. The drug could be used to limit radiation-induced brain injury or oral mucositis. EDA was found to ameliorate autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis), which is a frequent side effect observed after treatment of cancer patients with monoclonal antibodies targeting the immune checkpoint PD-1. Therefore, EDA could also be useful to reduce specific side effects of immuno-therapy. Collectively, the information suggests that the medical use of EDA, a drug with a proven safety after 18 years of use in brain-related Human diseases, could be extended to cancer-related conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we reported a nanovaccine, which was produced by encapsulating OVA (ovalbumin, a model antigen) chemically modified with MPGΔNLS (MPGΔNLS-OVA conjugate) into poly(lactide-co-glycolide) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles. We hypothesized that after the uptake of the nanovaccine into immune cells, MPGΔNLS, a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), would assist the escape of the antigens from lysosomes into the cytosol, increase the amount of antigens processed in the cytosol and subsequently enhance antigen cross-presentation via MHC-I molecules to elicit cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses. The results of the in vitro experiments demonstrated that the MPGΔNLS-OVA-loaded PLGA NPs not only elevated the release of OVA into the cytosol of dendritic cells (BMDCs), but also promoted the maturation and activation of BMDCs. It was also observed in mice vaccinated with MPGΔNLS-OVA-loaded PLGA NPs that the MPGΔNLS modification could stimulate the expansion of OVA-specific T-cells, generation of OVA-specific IgG antibodies and proliferation of OVA-specific memory T cells. Moreover, the treatment of E·G7-OVA tumor-bearing mice with MPGΔNLS-OVA-loaded PLGA NPs resulted in significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival periods of the mice compared to the treatment with unmodified OVA-PLGA NPs or free OVA. In summary, cell-penetrating peptides linked with antigens encapsulated in nanovaccines can spatiotemporally affect the intracellular localization of antigens, promote antigen cross-presentation and stimulate antigen-specific immune responses, especially CTL responses.

Due to the lack of direct control mechanisms, therapy-related adverse reactions including cytokine release- and tumor lysis syndrome can even become life-threatening. In case of target antigen expression on non-malignant cells, CAR T cells can also attack healthy tissues. To overcome such side effects, we have established a modular CAR platform termed UniCAR: UniCAR T cells per se are inert as they recognize a peptide epitope (UniCAR epitope) that is not accessible on the surface of living cells. Bifunctional adapter molecules termed target modules (TM) can cross-link UniCAR T cells with target cells. In the absence of TMs, UniCAR T cells automatically turn off. Until now, all UniCAR TMs were constructed by fusion of the UniCAR epitope to an antibody domain. To open up the wide field of low-molecular-weight compounds for retargeting of UniCAR T cells to tumor cells, and to follow in parallel the progress of UniCAR T cell therapy by PET imaging we challenged the idea to convert a PET tracer into a UniCAR-TM. For proof of concept, we selected the clinically used PET tracer PSMA-11, which binds to the prostate-specific membrane antigen overexpressed in prostate carcinoma. Here we show that fusion of the UniCAR epitope to PSMA-11 results in a low-molecular-weight theranostic compound that can be used for both retargeting of UniCAR T cells to tumor cells, and for non-invasive PET imaging and thus represents a member of a novel class of theranostics.© 2019 The Author(s).

The latter are synthesized from parent antibodies by fusing their light (V) and heavy (V)-chain variable domains into a single chain using a flexible linker peptide. The fusion of V and V domains can distort their relative orientation, thereby compromising specificity and association constant of scFv, and reducing the lytic efficacy of CAR-T cells. Here, we circumvent the complications of domains' fusion by designing scFv mutants that stabilize interaction between scFv and its target, thereby rescuing scFv efficacy. We employ an iterative approach, based on structural modeling and mutagenesis driven by computational protein design. To demonstrate the power of this approach, we use the scFv derived from an antibody specific to a human leukocyte antigen A2 (HLA-A2)-HER2-derived peptide complex. Whereas the parental antibody is highly specific to its target, the scFv showed reduced specificity. Using our approach, we design mutations into scFvs that restore specificity of the original antibody.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651881>Radiotherapy combined with cytokine-induced killer cell therapy for liver metastasis from rectal cancer: A case report.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer is the most common type of cancer leading to death; approximately 10% to 25% of rectal cancer patients present with synchronous colorectal liver metastases.

Tandem expression to target two or more misfolding proteins in one treatment may be especially valuable for proteostatic disruptions due to genetic, aging, or toxic triggers. Advances in bioinformatics, screening protocols, and especially gene therapy are showing great promise for intrabody/ nanobody treatments of a full range of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and related tau dementias, Parkinson's disease and Lewy body diseases, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion diseases, among others.Copyright © 2018.

Despite encouraging and sometimes durable responses in a subset of patients, most patients do not respond. Tumors have adopted the PD-1/PD-L1 axis for immune escape to facilitate tumor growth, which can be leveraged as a potential target for immune checkpoint inhibitors. On this basis, PD-L1 protein expression on tumor or immune cells emerged as the first potential predictive biomarker for sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. The goal of our study was to evaluate PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker based on all US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug approvals of immune checkpoint inhibitors. We evaluated the primary studies associated with 45 FDA drug approvals from 2011 until April 2019. In total, there were approvals across 15 tumor types. Across all approvals, PD-L1 was predictive in only 28.9% of cases, and was either not predictive (53.3%) or not tested (17.8%) in the remaining cases. There were 9 FDA approvals linked to a specific PD-L1 threshold and companion diagnostic: bladder cancer (N = 3), non-small cell lung cancer (N = 3), triple-negative breast cancer (N = 1), cervical cancer (N = 1), and gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer (N = 1) with 8 of 9 (88.9%) with immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy. The PD-L1 thresholds were variable both within and across tumor types using several different assays, including approvals at the following PD-L1 thresholds: 1, 5, and 50%. PD-L1 expression was also measured in a variable fashion either on tumor cells, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, or both. In conclusion, our findings indicate that PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker has limitations and that the decision to pursue testing must be carefully implemented for clinical decision-making.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666344>Prolonged survival in the absence of disease-recurrence in advanced-stage follicular lymphoma following chemo-: 13-year update of the prospective, multicenter randomized GITMO-IIL trial.</a></h2><p>A prospective trial conducted in the period 2000-2005 showed no survival advantage for high-dose chemotherapy with rituximab and autograft (R-HDS)  conventional chemotherapy with rituximab (CHOP-R) as first-line therapy in 134 high-risk follicular lymphoma patients aged <60 years. The study has been updated at the 13-year median follow up. As of February 2017, 88 (66%) patients were alive, with overall survival of 66.4% at 13 years, without a significant difference between R-HDS (64.5%) and CHOP-R (68.5%). To date, 46 patients have died, mainly because of disease progression (47.8% of all deaths), secondary malignancies (3 solid tumor, 9 myelodysplasia/acute leukemia; 26.1% of all deaths), and other toxicities (21.7% of all deaths). Complete remission was documented in 98 (73.1%) patients and associated with overall survival, with 13-year estimates of 77.0% and 36.8% for complete remission  no-complete remission, respectively. Molecular remission was documented in 39 (65%) out of 60 evaluable patients and associated with improved survival. In multivariate analysis, complete remission achievement had the strongest effect on survival (<0.001), along with younger age (=0.002) and female sex (=0.013). Overall, 50 patients (37.3%) survived with no disease recurrence (18 CHOP-R, 32 R-HDS). This follow up is the longest reported on follicular lymphoma treated upfront with rituximab-chemotherapy and demonstrates an unprecedented improvement in survival compared to the pre-rituximab era, regardless of the use of intensified or conventional treatment. Complete remission was the most important factor for prolonged survival and a high proportion of patients had prolonged survival in their first remission, raising the issue of curability in follicular lymphoma.

Immunotherapies such as those that target immune checkpoint molecules can be used to augment immune-mediated elimination of tumours and have resulted in durable responses in patients with cancer that did not respond to previous treatments. However, only a subset of patients benefit from  and more knowledge about what is required for successful treatment is needed. Although the role of tumour neoantigen-specific CD8 T cells in tumour rejection is well established, the roles of other subsets of T cells have received less attention. Here we show that spontaneous and -induced anti-tumour responses require the activity of both tumour-antigen-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells, even in tumours that do not express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. In addition, the expression of MHC class II-restricted antigens by tumour cells is required at the site of successful rejection, indicating that activation of CD4 T cells must also occur in the tumour microenvironment. These findings suggest that MHC class II-restricted neoantigens have a key function in the anti-tumour response that is nonoverlapping with that of MHC class I-restricted neoantigens and therefore needs to be considered when identifying patients who will most benefit from .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642783>Current Progresses of Functional Nanomaterials for Imaging Diagnosis and Treatment of Melanoma.</a></h2><p>Melanoma is a malignant skin tumor that results in poor disease prognosis due to unsuccessful treatment options. During the early stages of tumor progression, surgery is the primary approach that assures a good outcome. However, in the presence of metastasis, melanoma becomes almost immedicable, since the tumors can not be removed and the disease recurs easily in a short period of time. However, in recent years the combination of nanomedicine and chemotherapeutic drugs has offered promising solutions to the treatment of late-stage melanoma. Extensive studies have demonstrated that nanomaterials and their advanced applications can improve the efficacy of traditional chemotherapeutic drugs in order to overcome disadvantages, such as drug resistance, low drug delivery rate and reduced targeting to the tumor tissue. In the present review, we summarized the latest progress in imaging diagnosis and treatment of melanoma using functional nanomaterials, including polymers, liposomes, metal nanoparticles, magnetic nanoparticles and carbon-based nanoparticles.

Pertuzumab and trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) have been able to be introduced in HER2-positive breast cancer. Now other anti-HER2 therapies are being developed (e.g. margetuximab, DS-8201a, pyrotinib) which can overcome other resistance mechanisms in the HER2 signalling pathway. In the field of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, an mTOR inhibitor and CDK4/6 inhibitors were introduced in the past. Now the introduction of the first PI3K inhibitor is forthcoming and this inhibitor will involve genetic testing of the tumour for a mutation in the PIK3CA gene. There are also significant advancements in triple-negative breast cancer: By combining chemotherapy and , an advantage for overall survival was able to be demonstrated in a subgroup (immune cells PD-L1-positive). The PARP inhibitor therapy for HER2-negative patients with a germ line mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 was also associated with an improved overall survival in a subgroup.

In particular, it remains unexplored how driver mutations could be associated with distinct TIBs signatures and their role in tumor microenvironment.Here we analyzed associations of immunoglobulin isotypes and clonality with survival in TCGA RNA-Seq data for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), stratifying patients into 12 driver mutation and phenotypic tumor subgroups.We revealed several unexpected associations between TIBs behavior and prognosis. Abundance and high proportion of IgG1 isotype, and low proportion of IgA among all intratumorally produced immunoglobulins were specifically associated with improved overall survival for KRAS but not KRAS LUAD, revealing the first link between a driver mutation and B-cell response. We found specific IgG1 signature associated with long survival, which suggests that particular specificities of IgG1+ TIBs could be beneficial in KRAS LUAD. In contrast to our previous observations for melanoma, highly clonal IgG1 production by plasma cells had no meaningful effect on prognosis, suggesting that IgG1+ TIBs may exert a beneficial effect in KRAS cases in an alternative way, such as efficient presentation of cognate antigens or direct B cell attack on tumor cells. Notably, a high proportion of the IgG1 isotype is positively correlated with the non-silent mutation burden both in the general LUAD cohort and in most patient subgroups, supporting a role for IgG1 TIBs in antigen presentation. Complementing the recent finding that the presence of stromal IgG4-producing cells is associated with a favorable prognosis for patients with stage I squamous cell carcinoma, we show that the abundance of IgG4-producing TIBs likewise has a strong positive effect on overall survival in STK11 and proximal proliferative subgroups of LUAD patients. We hypothesize that the positive role of IgG4 antibodies in some of the lung cancer subtypes could be associated with reported inability of IgG4 isotype to form immune complexes, thus preventing immunosuppression via activation of the myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) phenotype.We discover prominent and distinct associations between TIBs antibody isotypes and survival in lung adenocarcinoma carrying specific driver mutations. These findings indicate that particular types of tumor-immunity relations could be beneficial in particular driver mutation context, which should be taken into account in developing strategies of cancer  and combination therapies. Specificity of protective B cell populations in specific cancer subgroups could become a clue to efficient targeted immunotherapies for appropriate cohorts of patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645629>Antigen array for serological diagnosis and novel allergen identification in severe equine asthma.</a></h2><p>Severe equine asthma (sEA), which closely resembles human asthma, is a debilitating and performance-limiting allergic respiratory disorder which affects 14% of horses in the Northern Hemisphere and is associated with increased allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) against a range of environmental proteins.

Failure of immune response to clear the oncogenic infection can facilitate cancer progression. The aim of the present study was to analyze early and late activation of T-lymphocytes related to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection by the expression of markers of activation (CD69, CD25) on the surface of T-lymphocytes (CD3, CD4, CD8) in patients bearing laryngeal cancer according to absence/presence immunoglobulin G antibodies to EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA1).Thirty-three patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LC) and 20 volunteers without cancer (control group) were enrolled in the study. Peripheral blood samples were collected from every individual. The markers of activation of T-lymphocytes were determined by flow cytometry, whereas commercial immunoenzymatic assay kits were used for detection of anti-viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM, anti-VCA IgG, and anti-EBNA1 IgG.Increased early activation of CD8 and CD4 T-lymphocytes was found in patients with LC. There was a significantly higher proportion of CD4 and CD8T-lymphocytes expressing CD69 antigen in patients with LC compared to the control group. The proportion of CD4 CD25 T-lymphocytes in patients with LC positive for anti-EBNA1 IgG and anti-VCA IgM was lower compared to patients without antibodies to VCA IgM.The dysfunction of immune response in larynx cancer patients could be associated with EBV infection.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

However, the currently adopted methods of modification of T cells pose a risk of insertional oncogenesis because lentiviral and retroviral vectors integrate the CAR transgene in a semi-random fashion. In addition, this therapy is only available using autologous cells, which create problems in production and limit the access for patients who had their T cells depleted. One modification method that shows the ability to overcome both drawbacks is the knock-in of the CAR simultaneously knocking-out genes that prevent allogeneic therapy, such as the endogenous T cell receptor. In this mini-review, we present recent efforts to develop safer universal CAR-T cells. More specifically, we focus on the combined application of target-directed nucleases, which create a double-strand break at a specific genome locus, and the delivery of CAR DNA via adeno-associated viral vectors for subsequent integration via homologous recombination and silencing of the targeted gene.

Diagnosis of EOC is frequently made at advanced stages and, despite aggressive treatments combining surgery and chemotherapy, fatal relapse rapidly occurs and is accompanied by a peritoneal carcinosis. In this context, novel therapeutical advances are urgently required. Adoptive transfer(s) of immune effector cells, including allogeneic human Vγ9Vδ2 T lymphocytes, represent attractive targets for efficiently and safely tracking tissue-invading tumor cells and controlling tumor dissemination in the organism. Our study describes the establishment of robust and physiological orthotopic model of human EOC in mouse, that includes surgical resection (ovariectomy) and chemotherapy, which are ineluctably accompanied by a fatal peritoneal carcinosis recurrence. Through a complementary set of  and  experiments, we provide here a preclinical proof of interest of the antitumor efficiency of adoptive transfers of allogeneic human Vγ9Vδ2 T lymphocytes against EOC, in association with surgical debulking and standard chemotherapies (i.e., taxanes and platinum salts). Moreover, our results indicate that chemo- and immunotherapies can be combined to improve the antitumor efficiency of immunotherapeutic lines. Altogether, these results further pave the way for next-generation antitumor immunotherapies, based on local administrations of human allogeneic human Vγ9Vδ2 T lymphocytes, in association with standard treatments.© 2019 The Author(s).

Although tumor responses to MEK inhibition are rarely durable, MEK inhibitors have shown substantial activity and durable tumor regressions when combined with systemic immunotherapies in preclinical models of RAS-driven tumors. MEK inhibitors have been shown to potentiate anti-tumor T cell immunity, but little is known about the effects of MEK inhibition on other immune subsets, including B cells. We show here that treatment with a MEK inhibitor reduces B regulatory cells (Bregs) in vitro, and reduces the number of Bregs in tumor draining lymph nodes in a colorectal cancer model in vivo. MEK inhibition does not impede anti-tumor humoral immunity, and B cells contribute meaningfully to anti-tumor immunity in the context of MEK inhibitor therapy. Treatment with a MEK inhibitor is associated with improved T cell infiltration and an enhanced response to anti-PD1 . Together these data indicate that MEK inhibition may reduce Bregs while sparing anti-tumor B cell function, resulting in enhanced anti-tumor immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667924>Current management of patients with melanoma who are found to be sentinel node-positive.</a></h2><p>The results of the DeCOG-SLT and MSLT-II studies, published in 2016 and mid-2017, indicated no survival benefit from completion lymph node dissection (CLND) in melanoma patients with positive sentinel nodes (SNs). Subsequently, several studies have been published reporting a benefit of adjuvant systemic therapy in patients with stage III melanoma. The current study assessed how these findings influenced management of SN-positive patients in a dedicated melanoma treatment centre.SN-positive patients treated at Melanoma Institute Australia between July 2017 and December 2018 were prospectively identified. Surgeons completed a questionnaire documenting the management of each patient. Information on patients, primary tumours, SNs, further treatment and follow-up was collected from patient files, the institutional research database and pathology reports.During the 18-month study period, 483 patients underwent SN biopsy. A positive SN was found in 61 (13%). Two patients (3%) requested CLND because of anxiety about observation in view of unfavourable primary tumour and SN characteristics. The other 59 patients (97%) were followed with a four-monthly ultrasound examination of the relevant lymph node field(s). Two of them (3%) developed an isolated nodal recurrence after 4 and 11 months of follow-up. Fifty-seven patients (93%) were seen following the publication of the first two adjuvant systemic therapy studies in November 2017; 46 (81%) were referred to a medical oncologist to discuss adjuvant systemic therapy, which 32 (70%) chose to receive.At Melanoma Institute Australia most patients with an involved SN are now managed without CLND.

Such metrics have value in measuring the outcomes of conventional therapies, but may not be the most appropriate for new therapies. Immuno-oncology therapies offer a new approach to treating cancer by stimulating patients' immune systems to fight cancer. The value of these novel therapies has so far been assessed with traditional metrics, but the different ways in which immuno-oncology therapies work can mean the full value is not captured. Immuno-oncology therapies can produce longer survival times but this effect can be delayed or even preceded by an apparent phase of progression, which median survival or response rates may not reflect.

Although the association of type 2 diabetes with CVD has been well described, the mechanisms, risk stratification and screening strategies of CVD in type 1 diabetes (T1D) are less understood. This review aims to evaluate recent literature and guidelines regarding CVD in T1D. At the cellular level, the early stage of CVD is characterized by endothelial dysfunction. Recent studies have shown that endothelial function is unaffected in younger T1D patients but there is a significant degree of endothelial dysfunction in the older T1D population compared with healthy age-matched controls, highlighting the importance of the endothelial dysfunction in T1D as a major age-dependent cardiovascular risk factor. T1D risk assessment tools have been developed similar to those seen in type 2 diabetes. Foremost among these are the Danish Steno Type 1 risk engine, the Swedish T1D risk score, the Scottish T1D risk score and the QRISK risk calculator. The latter risk prediction tool is used for all patients but contains T1D as an independent risk variable and has the advantage of being derived from, and validated in, a large and diverse population. The latest version (QRISK3) is likely to be recommended for routine use in T1D patients in upcoming guidelines by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence. Mortality in adults with T1D is increasingly due to CVD. This is driven by hyperglycaemia-mediated oxidative stress and vascular inflammation, resulting in atherosclerosis and cardiac autonomic neuropathy. Coronary artery disease is the most significant contributor to CVD and in T1D, has a propensity towards a more silent and severe form. Routine screening of coronary artery disease does not alter outcomes and is therefore not recommended; however, risk prediction tools are being developed to aid identification of high-risk individuals for aggressive risk factor modification strategies.Copyright © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Vaccination against neoepitopes derived from patient tumor material can generate tumor-specific T cell immunity, which could reinforce the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitor therapies such as anti-PD-1 treatment. DNA vaccination is a versatile platform that allows the inclusion of multiple neoantigen-coding sequences in a single formulation and therefore represents an ideal platform for neoantigen vaccination. We developed an anti-tumor vaccine based on a synthetic DNA vector designed to contain multiple cancer-specific epitopes in tandem. The DNA vector encoded a fusion gene consisting of three neoepitopes derived from the mouse colorectal tumor MC38 and their natural flanking sequences as 40 amino acid stretches. In addition, we incorporated as reporter epitopes the helper and CTL epitope sequences of ovalbumin. The poly-neoantigen DNA vaccine elicited T cell responses to all three neoantigens and induced functional CD8 and CD4 T cell responses to the reporter antigen ovalbumin after intradermal injection in mice. The DNA vaccine was effective in preventing outgrowth of B16 melanoma expressing ovalbumin in a prophylactic setting. Moreover, the combination of therapeutic DNA vaccination and anti-PD-1 treatment was synergistic in controlling MC38 tumor growth whereas individual treatments did not succeed. These data demonstrate the potential of DNA vaccination to target multiple neoepitopes in a single formulation and highlight the cooperation between vaccine-based and checkpoint blockade immunotherapies for the successful eradication of established tumors.© 2019 The Author(s).

Conversely, its expression was up-regulated in cases positive for Epstein Barr Virus (EBV+) together with genes related to macrophage biology and targets of clinical  such as programmed-cell-death-ligand-1 (PD-L1). Notably, high DOK1 positivity in stroma cells conferred poor prognosis in patients and correlated with high levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase in CD68+ tumor-associated macrophages. In macrophages derived from human monocytic leukemia cell lines, DOK1 (i) was inducible by agonists of the anti-diabetic transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ), (ii) increased polarization towards an inflammatory phenotype, (iii) augmented nuclear factor-κB-dependent transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and (iv) reduced PD-L1 expression. These properties empowered DOK1+ macrophages to decrease the viability of human gastric cancer cells in contact-dependent co-cultures.

Targeted genomic sequencing of 315 genes from this tumor revealed GNAQ Q209L mutation and low (4 mutations/Megabase) tumor mutation burden (TMB). Wildtype NRAS, KIT, and BRAF were also observed. A cohort of 4,787 melanomas was subsequently analyzed to identify additional primary central nervous system melanomas, of which 10 additional tumors met pathologic criteria (0.21% of total melanoma cohort). These tumors were genomically assessed according to the same targeted sequencing panel, and 6 of the tumors were also found to harbor a GNAQ mutation. All 10 tumors had low (less than or equal to 2 mutations/Megabase) TMB indicating a potential trend between G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) alterations and low TMB in LMNs. GPCR alterations were found to significantly correlate with TMB across the cohort of 4,787 melanomas, supporting this potential finding in the limited LMN subset.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Demographic, clinical, and histopathological data were collected from electronic medical records.There were 13 patients (7 males) with a median age of 68 years (range: 39- 82) who were treated with nivolumab (n=7) or pembrolizumab (n=6). Oral irAEs included lichenoid lesions (n=10), erythema multiforme (EM) (n=2), and acute graft-vs-host disease re-activation (n=1), with or without ulcerations (n=8). Four patients (31%) presented with only oral irAEs. Oral biopsies showed lichenoid mucositis (n=4). Management with topical and systemic steroids led to complete symptomatic response in most patients (n=12). PD-1 inhibitor therapy was temporarily discontinued (n=3) and discontinued indefinitely (n=2) due to severe oral irAEs.Patients receiving PD-1 inhibitors may develop oral irAEs characterized by lichenoid lesions, ulcers or EM. Topical and systemic steroids appear to be effective in managing oral lesions although the severity of irAEs may necessitate PD-1 inhibitor therapy dose modification.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

It is characterized by a poor prognosis even for patients treated with trimodality therapy, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Moreover, the majority of patients are not candidates for surgery due to disease advanced stage or medical comorbidities. For these patients, the survival rate is even lower and few therapeutic options are currently available. Nevertheless, many interesting novel approaches are under investigation, among which  represents one of the most promising emerging strategies.

However, the inherent stochasticity of the poration process in many of these approaches often results in a trade-off between delivery efficiency and cellular viability, thus potentially limiting their utility. Herein, we present a novel microfluidic device concept that mitigates this trade-off by providing opportunity for deterministic mechanoporation (DMP) of cells en masse. This is achieved by the impingement of each cell upon a single needle-like penetrator during aspiration-based capture, followed by diffusive influx of exogenous cargo through the resulting membrane pore, once the cells are released by reversal of flow. Massive parallelization enables high throughput operation, while single-site poration allows for delivery of small and large-molecule cargos in difficult-to-transfect cells with efficiencies and viabilities that exceed both conventional and emerging transfection techniques. As such, DMP shows promise for advancing cellular engineering practice in general and engineered cell product manufacturing in particular.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656546>Imaging of T-cells and their responses during anti-cancer .</a></h2><p> has proven to be an effective approach in a growing number of cancers.

We previously identified a nephritogenic epitope, P14 (3), that could induce crescentic nephritis in WKY rats, and defined its core motif. Designing a modified peptide, replacing critical pathogenic residues with nonpathogenic ones (on the basis of homologous regions in 1NC1 chain of type IV collagen, known to be nonpathogenic), might provide a therapeutic option for anti-GBM GN.We synthesized a modified peptide, replacing a single amino acid, and injected it into 3-P14-immunized rats from day 0 (the early-treatment group) or a later-treatment group (from days 17 to 21). A scrambled peptide administrated with the same protocol served as a control.The modified peptide, but not the scrambled peptide, attenuated anti-GBM GN in both treatment groups, and halted further crescent formation even after disease onset. Kidneys from the modified peptide-treated rats exhibited reductions in IgG deposits, complement activation, and infiltration by T cells and macrophages. Treatment also resulted in an anti-inflammatory cytokine profile versus a proinflammatory profile for animals not receiving the modified peptide; it also reduced 3-P14-specific T cell activation, modulated T cell differentiation by decreasing Th17 cells and enhancing the ratio of Treg/Th17 cells, and inhibited binding of 3-P14 to antibodies and MHC II molecules.A modified peptide involving alteration of a critical motif in a nephritogenic T cell epitope alleviated anti-GBM GN in a rat model.

Surgery, chemo, and radiation therapy have been the only options available until today to combat this major problem. Chemotherapeutic drugs have been used for treatment for more than 50 years. Unfortunately, these drugs have inherent cytotoxicities and tumor cells have started inducing resistance against these drugs. Other common techniques such as surgery and radiotherapy have their own drawbacks. Therefore, such techniques are incompetent tools to alleviate the disease efficiently without any adverse effects. This scenario has inspired researchers to develop alternative techniques with enhanced therapeutic effects and minimal side effects. Such techniques include targeted therapy, liposomal therapy, hormonal therapy, and , etc. However, these therapies are expensive and not effective enough. Furthermore, researchers have conjugated therapeutic agents or drugs with different molecules, delivery vectors, and/or imaging modalities to combat such problems and enhance the therapeutic effect. This conjugation technique has led to the development of bioconjugation therapy, in which at least one molecule is of biological origin. These bioconjugates are the new therapeutic strategies, having prospective synergistic antitumor effects and have potency to overcome the complications being produced by chemo drugs. Herein, we provide an overview of various bioconjugates developed so far, as well as their classification, characteristics, and targeting approach for cancer. Additionally, the most popular nanostructures based on their organic or inorganic origin (metallic, magnetic, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, and silica nanoparticles) characterized as nanocarriers are also discussed. Moreover, we hope that this review will provide inspiration for researchers to develop better bioconjugates as therapeutic agents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658392>Advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma: real world data of patient profiles and treatment patterns.</a></h2><p>Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is one of the most common types of cancer in the Caucasian population, with an increasing incidence. cSCC is mostly a local invasive disease that can be treated surgically in the majority of the cases. However, in the case of advanced cSCC (acSCC), a multimodality approach also involving systemic therapies needs to be considered.One hundred and ninety-five patients diagnosed with acSCC (stages III and IV) treated in our centre between 2011 and 2018 were included. Patient and tumour characteristics along with treatment patterns were documented and analyzed. Descriptive analysis was performed and survival rates were estimated according to Kaplan-Meier and compared with the Log-rank test. Follow-up was defined as the time between diagnosis of advanced disease and last contact or death. All causes of death were considered as events.The median follow-up was 21 months [IQR = (10.0; 21.0)]. The median age at time of advanced disease diagnosis was 78 years [IQR = (72; 84)], with 40.5% of the patients in stage III and 59.5% in stage IV. One hundred and forty-five patients had resectable tumours. In this group the median overall survival (mOS) was 59 months (95% CI: 28.2-89.8), significantly higher than the mOS in patients with inoperable tumour [n = 50; mOS: 19 months (96% CI: 7-31, P <0.0001)]. Patients receiving  (n = 20) showed a statistically significant better survival compared to those treated with other systemic therapies (n = 37; mOS not reached vs. mOS: 22 months (95% CI: 6.5-43.5), P = 0.034). For patients without systemic therapy, a combination of surgery and radiotherapy provided better outcomes compared to radiotherapy alone or best supportive care (P <0.001).Surgical complete resection should be the first therapeutic option for patients with acSCC. For patients with inoperable tumour, first-line  should be preferably considered.© 2019 The Authors.

To explain this heterogeneity, we sought to identify a composite signature predictive of insulin secretion, using a collaborative assay evaluation and analysis pipeline that incorporated multiple cellular and serum measures reflecting beta cell health and immune system activity. The ability to predict decline in insulin secretion would be useful for patient stratification for clinical trial enrollment or therapeutic selection. Analytes from 12 qualified assays were measured in shared samples from subjects newly diagnosed with T1D. We developed a computational tool to identify a composite panel associated with decline in insulin secretion over 2 years after diagnosis. The tool employs multiple filtering steps to reduce data dimensionality, incorporates error-estimation techniques including cross-validation and sensitivity analysis, and is flexible to assay type, clinical outcome and disease setting. Using this novel analytical tool, we identified a panel of immune markers that, in combination, are highly associated with loss of insulin secretion. The methods used here represent a novel process for identifying combined immune signatures that predict outcomes relevant for complex and heterogeneous diseases like T1D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665239>Tumour-associated macrophage-derived interleukin-1 mediates glioblastoma-associated cerebral oedema.</a></h2><p>Glioblastoma is the most common and uncompromising primary brain tumour and is characterized by a dismal prognosis despite aggressive treatment regimens. At the cellular level, these tumours are composed of a mixture of neoplastic cells and non-neoplastic cells, including tumour-associated macrophages and endothelial cells. Cerebral oedema is a near-universal occurrence in patients afflicted with glioblastoma and it is almost exclusively managed with the corticosteroid dexamethasone despite significant drawbacks associated with its use. Here, we demonstrate that dexamethasone blocks interleukin-1 production in both bone marrow-derived and brain resident macrophage populations following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and interferon gamma. Additionally, dexamethasone is shown to inhibit downstream effectors of interleukin-1 signalling in both macrophage populations. Co-culture of bone marrow-derived macrophages with organotypic tumour slices results in an upregulation of interleukin-1 cytokines, an effect that is absent in co-cultured microglia. Genetic ablation of interleukin-1 ligands or receptor in mice bearing RCAS/tv-a-induced platelet-derived growth factor B-overexpressing glioblastoma results in reduced oedema and partial restoration of the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, respectively; similar to results obtained with vascular endothelial growth factor neutralization. We establish that tumours from dexamethasone-treated mice exhibit reduced infiltration of cells of the myeloid and lymphoid compartments, an effect that should be considered during clinical trials for  in glioblastoma patients. Additionally, we emphasize that caution should be used when immune profiling and single-cell RNA sequencing data are interpreted from fresh glioblastoma patient samples, as nearly all patients receive dexamethasone after diagnosis. Collectively, this evidence suggests that interleukin-1 signalling inhibition and dexamethasone treatment share therapeutic efficacies and establishes interleukin-1 signalling as an attractive and specific therapeutic target for the management of glioblastoma-associated cerebral oedema.© The Author(s) (2019).

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect on the bioenergetic status and the oxidative-mediated tissue injury of an uninterrupted combined protocol of HMP+NMP using a single haemoglobin-based oxygen carrier (HBOC)-based perfusate.Ten discarded human donor livers had either 2 hours of dual hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (D-HOPE) with sequential controlled rewarming (COR) and then NMP using the HBOC-based perfusate uninterruptedly (cold-to-warm group); or 2 hours of hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) with an oxygen carrier-free perfusate, followed by perfusate exchange and then NMP with an HBOC-based perfusate. Markers of liver function, tissue adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels and tissue injury were systematically assessed.The hypothermic phase downregulated mitochondrial respiration and increased ATP levels in both groups. The cold-to-warm group presented higher arterial vascular resistance during rewarming/NMP (p = 0.03) with a trend of lower arterial flow (p = 0.09). At the end of NMP tissue expression of markers of reactive oxygen species production, oxidative injury and inflammation were comparable between the groups.The uninterrupted combined protocol of HMP+NMP using an HBOC-based perfusate-cold-to-warm MP-mitigated the oxidative-mediated tissue injury and enhanced hepatic energy stores, similarly to an interrupted combined protocol; however, it simplified the logistics of this combination and may favour its clinical applicability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657935>Sustained delivery of carfilzomib by tannic acid-based nanocapsules helps develop antitumor immunity.</a></h2><p>A group of chemotherapeutic drugs has gained increasing interest in cancer  due to the potential to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). A critical challenge in using the ICD inducers in cancer  is the immunotoxicity accompanying their antiproliferative effects. To alleviate this, a nanocapsule formulation of carfilzomib (CFZ), an ICD-inducing proteasome inhibitor, was developed using interfacial supramolecular assembly of tannic acid (TA) and iron, supplemented with albumin coating. The albumin-coated CFZ nanocapsules (CFZ-pTA-alb) attenuated CFZ release, reducing toxicity to immune cells. Moreover, due to the adhesive nature of TA assembly, CFZ-pTA-alb served as a reservoir of damage-associated molecular patterns released from dying tumor cells to activate dendritic cells. Upon intratumoral administration, CFZ-pTA-alb prolonged tumor retention of CFZ and showed consistently greater antitumor effects than cyclodextrin-solubilized CFZ (CFZ-CD) in B16F10 and CT26 tumor models. Unlike CFZ-CD, the locally injected CFZ-pTA-alb protected or enhanced CD8+ T cell population in tumors, helped develop splenocytes with tumor-specific interferon- response, and delayed tumor development on the contralateral side in immunocompetent mice (but not in athymic nude mice), which support that CFZ-pTA-alb contributed to activating antitumor immunity. This study demonstrates that sustained delivery of ICD inducers by TA-based nanocapsules is an effective way of translating local ICD induction to systemic antitumor immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651363>Systemic and local immunity following adoptive transfer of NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T cells in synovial sarcoma.</a></h2><p>Gene-modified autologous T cells expressing NY-ESO-1, an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor (TCR) reactive against the NY-ESO-1-specific HLA-A*02-restricted peptide SLLMWITQC (NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T-cells; GSK 794), have demonstrated clinical activity in patients with advanced synovial sarcoma (SS). The factors contributing to gene-modified T-cell expansion and the changes within the tumor microenvironment (TME) following T-cell infusion remain unclear. These studies address the immunological mechanisms of response and resistance in patients with SS treated with NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T-cells.Four cohorts were included to evaluate antigen expression and preconditioning on efficacy. Clinical responses were assessed by RECIST v1.1. Engineered T-cell persistence was determined by qPCR. Serum cytokines were evaluated by immunoassay. Transcriptomic analyses and immunohistochemistry were performed on tumor biopsies from patients before and after T-cell infusion. Gene-modified T-cells were detected within the TME via an RNAish assay.Responses across cohorts were affected by preconditioning and intra-tumoral NY-ESO-1 expression. Of the 42 patients reported (data cut-off 4June2018), 1 patient had a complete response, 14 patients had partial responses, 24 patients had stable disease, and 3 patients had progressive disease. The magnitude of gene-modified T-cell expansion shortly after infusion was associated with response in patients with high intra-tumoral NY-ESO-1 expression. Patients receiving a fludarabine-containing conditioning regimen experienced increases in serum IL-7 and IL-15. Prior to infusion, the TME exhibited minimal leukocyte infiltration; CD163 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were the dominant population. Modest increases in intra-tumoral leukocytes (≤5%) were observed in a subset of subjects at approximately 8 weeks. Beyond 8 weeks post infusion, the TME was minimally infiltrated with a TAM-dominant leukocyte infiltrate. Tumor-associated antigens and antigen presentation did not significantly change within the tumor post-T-cell infusion. Finally, NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T cells trafficked to the TME and maintained cytotoxicity in a subset of patients.Our studies elucidate some factors that underpin response and resistance to NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T-cell therapy. From these data, we conclude that a lymphodepletion regimen containing high doses of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide is necessary for SPEAR T-cell persistence and efficacy. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that non-T-cell inflamed tumors, which are resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, can be treated with adoptive T-cell based .ClinicalTrials.gov,  , Registered 27 April 2011.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661465>U3-1402 sensitizes HER3-expressing tumors to PD-1 blockade by immune activation.</a></h2><p> targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) induces durable antitumor efficacy in many types of cancer. However, such clinical benefit is limited because of the insufficient reinvigoration of antitumor immunity with the drug alone; therefore, rational therapeutic combinations are required to improve its efficacy. In our preclinical study, we evaluated the antitumor effect of U3-1402, a human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3)-targeting antibody-drug conjugate, and its potential synergism with PD-1 inhibition. Using a syngeneic mouse tumor model that is refractory to anti-PD-1 therapy, treatment with U3-1402 exhibited an obvious antitumor effect via direct lysis of tumor cells. Disruption of tumor cells by U3-1402 enhanced the infiltration of innate and adaptive immune cells. Chemotherapy with exatecan derivative (Dxd: the drug payload of U3-1402) revealed that the enhanced antitumor immunity produced by U3-1402 was associated with the induction of alarmins including HMGB-1 via tumor-specific cytotoxicity. Notably, U3-1402 significantly sensitized the tumor to PD-1 blockade, as a combination of U3-1402 and the PD-1 inhibitor significantly enhanced antitumor immunity. Further, clinical analyses indicated that tumor-specific HER3 expression was frequently observed in patients with PD-1 inhibitor-resistant solid tumors. Overall, U3-1402 is a promising candidate as a partner of  for such patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659111>The Activity of Immune Checkpoint Inhibition in KRAS Mutated Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: A Single Centre Experience.</a></h2><p>KRAS mutation is the most frequent molecular alteration found in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is associated with a poor prognosis without available targeted therapy. Treatment options for NSCLC have been recently enriched by the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and data about their efficacy in patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC are discordant. This study assessed the routine efficacy of ICIs in advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC.All stage IV NSCLC patients treated in our institution from January 2016 to December 2017 with  were included in our analysis. We collected the status of KRAS and other mutations, as well as the type of ICI administered. We assessed four clinical outcomes: i) disease control rate (DCR), ii) partial response (PR), iii) progression-free survival (PFS) and iv) overall survival (OS).A total of 45 patients were initially identified but 7 were excluded due to insufficient clinical data, so 38 were included in the end. In the KRAS wild-type cohort, the DCR was 59% with 49% PR, while the PFS was 8.4 months and OS 16.8 months. Among KRAS mutated patients, results were more favourable, the DCR was 81%, with 62% PR. PFS was 13.6 months and OS was 18.5 months. The median follow-up was 24 months (17 to 34 months) and 7 patients were still on treatment at the time of analysis.Our data suggest that KRAS mutation is predictive of a superior response to . Furthermore, the lack of response of STK11 and KRAS co-mutated NSCLC patients to ICIs, is indeed negated by an additional TP53 mutation.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

How myeloid cells acquire the protumoral properties during tumorigenesis is poorly understood. We report here that the polarity protein TIPE2 (tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8-like 2) mediates the functional polarization of murine and human MDSCs by specifying their pro- and antitumoral properties. Tumor cells induced the expression of TIPE2 in Gr1CD11b cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS). TIPE2 in turn increased the expression of protumoral mediators such as CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β while inhibiting the expression of antitumoral mediators. Consequently, tumor growth in TIPE2-deficient mice was significantly diminished, and TIPE2-deficient MDSCs markedly inhibited tumor growth upon adoptive transfer. Pharmaceutical blockade of ROS inhibited TIPE2 expression in MDSCs and reduced tumor growth in mice. These findings indicate that TIPE2 plays a key role in the functional polarization of MDSCs and represents a new therapeutic target for cancer .© 2019 Yan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672626>Cationic Synthetic Long Peptides-Loaded Nanogels: An Efficient Therapeutic Vaccine formulation for induction of T-cell Responses.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have shown a high potency of protein-based vaccines for cell-mediated cancer . However, due to their poor cellular uptake, efficient immune responses with soluble protein antigens are often not observed. As a result of superior cellular uptake, nanogels loaded with antigenic peptides were investigated in this study as carrier systems for cancer . Different synthetic long peptides (SLPs) containing the CTL and CD4 T-helper (Help) epitopes were synthesized and covalently conjugated via disulfide bonds to the polymeric network of cationic dextran nanogels. Cationic nanogels with a size of 210 nm, positive zeta potential (+24 mV) and high peptide loading content (15%) showed triggered release of the loaded peptides under reducing conditions. An in vitro study demonstrated the capability of cationic nanogels to maturate dendritic cells (DCs). Importantly, covalently SLP-loaded nanogels adjuvanted with poly(I:C) showed superior CD8 T cell responses compared to soluble peptides and nanogel formulations with physically loaded peptides both in vitro and in vivo.

Studies show, however, that DC vaccine priming of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) requires the activity of endogenous DC, suggesting that exogenous DC stimulate anti-tumor immunity by transferring antigen (Ag) to endogenous DC. Such Ag transfer functions are most commonly ascribed to monocytes, implying that undifferentiated monocytes would function equally well as a vaccine modality and need not be differentiated to DC to be effective. Here, we used several murine cancer models to test the anti-tumor efficacy of undifferentiated monocytes loaded with protein or peptide Ag. Intravenously injected monocytes displayed anti-tumor activity superior to DC vaccines in several cancer models, including aggressive intracranial glioblastoma. Ag-loaded monocytes induced robust CTL responses via Ag transfer to splenic CD8+ DC in a manner independent of monocyte APC activity. Ag transfer required cell-cell contact and the formation of connexin 43-containing gap junctions between monocytes and DC. These findings demonstrate the existence of an efficient gap junction-mediated Ag transfer pathway between monocytes and CD8+ DC and suggest that administration of tumor Ag-loaded undifferentiated monocytes may serve as a simple and efficacious  for the treatment of human cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642134>Intradermal reactivity to two concentrations of pollen extracts in atopic dogs.</a></h2><p>Intradermal test (IDT) is used widely for determination of allergens to include in allergen-specific  (AIT).

In addition to the hospital's standard IDT concentration of 1,000 PNU/mL for pollen allergens, five pollen allergens of higher concentration (3,000-8,000 PNU/mL) had been added at the beginning of that period. The IDT scores for the standard test concentration of each of the five allergens were compared to the scores for the higher concentration.Positive reactions occurred much more commonly to the higher test concentration for each of the paired allergens (P < 0.05, chi-square). The AIT formulation was different in 58% of the dogs from what it would have been without the higher concentration allergens.The current standard IDT concentration of 1,000 PNU/mL for pollen allergens is likely too low, possibly resulting in inaccurate AIT formulations. This might explain treatment failures and the incorrect diagnosis of atopic-like dermatitis. Further work is needed to establish optimal allergen test concentrations.© 2019 ESVD and ACVD, Veterinary Dermatology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651174>PLGA Nanoparticles Co-Delivering siRNAs against Programmed Cell Death Protein-1 and Its Ligand Gene for Suppression of Colon Tumor Growth.</a></h2><p>Tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes highly express programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) that interacts with its ligand, programmed cell death protein ligand-1 (PD-L1) on tumors. PD-1/PD-L1 interactions cause functional exhaustion of effector T cells and impair antitumor immunity, allowing tumors to escape immune surveillance. In addition to such extrinsic interactions, tumors proliferate by transmitting intrinsic PD-L1 signals via mTOR pathway. Here, we simultaneously silenced PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on CTLs and colon tumors using PD-1 siRNA/PD-L1 siRNA-loaded PLGA nanoparticles and investigated functional activation of tumor-specific CTLs. When compared to a single PD-1 silencing on CTLs or a single PD-L1 silencing on tumors, co-silencing of PD-1/PD-L1 on CTLs and tumors more efficiently promoted effector functions of tumor-specific CTLs. Moreover, PD-L1-silenced tumors inhibited mTOR signaling and showed an antiproliferative response independently of adaptive immune response. Ultimately, systemic administration of PD-1 and PD-L1 siRNA via PLGA nanoparticles restored the effector functions of tumor-specific CTLs in MC38 tumor-bearing mice. Compared with antitumor effects of PD-1 or PD-L1 single silencing alone, co-silencing of PD-1 and PD-L1 showed more significant tumor growth suppression and long-term tumor inhibition in colon cancer.

In addition to well-recognized urticaria and anaphylaxis triggered by IgE antibody-mediated immune responses, there is an increasing recognition of cell-mediated disorders such as eosinophilic esophagitis and food protein-induced enterocolitis. Non-IgE-Mediated gastrointestinal food allergies are an heterogeneous group of food allergies in which there is an immune reaction against food but the primary pathogenesis is not a production of IgE and activation of mastcells and basophils. Those diseases tend to affect mainly the gastrointestinal tract and can present as acute (FPIES) or chronic reaction such as Celiac disease, Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE), Food Protein Induced Allergic Proctocolitis (FPIAP). The role of food allergy in Non-EoE gastrointestinal Eosinophilc disorders (Non-EoE EGID) is poorly defined. In some diseases like Celiac Disease and possibly EoE T cell seems to play a major role in initiating the immunological reaction against food, however in FPIES and FPIAP the mechanism of sensitization is not clear. Diagnosis require food challenges and/or endoscopies in most of the patients. Celiac disease have some validated biomarkers but none of the other Non-IgE mediated food allergies have such biomarkers that can be used for monitoring or diagnosis of the diseases. Treatment of Non-IgE food allergy rely on diet (FPIES, Celiac disease and EoE) and/or use of drugs (i.e steroids, PPI) in EoE and Non-EoE EGID. Non-gE mediated food allergies are object of intense investigation.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672795>AKI with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: A Push beyond Case Reports.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668929>Mechanisms Controlling PD-L1 Expression in Cancer.</a></h2><p>The engagement of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; encoded by the PDCD1 gene) receptor expressed on activated T cells and its ligand, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1; encoded by the CD274 gene), is a major co-inhibitory checkpoint signaling that controls T cell activities.

Like many infectious agents, EBV has evolved strategies to block host cell death, including through expression of viral homologues of cellular BCL-2 pro-survival proteins (vBCL-2s), such as BHRF1. Small molecule inhibitors of the cellular pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins, termed 'BH3-mimetics', have entered clinical trials for blood cancers with the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax already approved for treatment of therapy refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia in the elderly. The generation of BH3-mimetics that could specifically target vBCL-2 proteins may be an attractive therapeutic option for virus-associated cancers, since these drugs would be expected to only kill virally infected cells with only minimal side effects on normal healthy tissues. To achieve this, a better understanding of the contribution of vBCL-2 proteins to tumorigenesis and insights into their biochemical functions is needed. In the context of Burkitt lymphoma (BL), BHRF1 expression conferred strong resistance to diverse apoptotic stimuli. Furthermore, BHRF1 expression in mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells accelerated MYC-induced lymphoma development in a model of BL. BHRF1 interacts with the cellular pro-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins, BIM, BID, PUMA and BAK, but its capability to inhibit apoptosis could not be mapped solely to one of these interactions, suggesting plasticity is a key feature of BHRF1. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed a site in BHRF1 that was critical for its interaction with PUMA and blocking DNA-damage-induced apoptosis, identifying a potentially therapeutically targetable vulnerability in BHRF1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662753>Factors Influencing the Efficacy of Anti-PD-1 Therapy in Chinese Patients with Advanced Melanoma.</a></h2><p>Anti-PD-1 antibody improves the survival of patients with advanced melanoma. However, the efficacy and safety of anti-programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody have not been fully elucidated in Chinese melanoma patients, who show high frequency of mucosal and acral melanoma subtypes; besides, the factors influencing the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody have not been evaluated broadly.Patients with advanced melanoma treated with regimens containing anti-PD-1 antibody from June 2016 to January 2019 were evaluated. Baseline characteristics and blood parameters were assessed, and outcome and adverse events were evaluated according to different regimens. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for univariate and multivariate analyses.A total of 51 patients with advanced melanoma were included in this study. The overall objective response rate (ORR) was 17.6%, the disease control rate was 58.5%, and the median time to progression was 5.2 months. The ORR of patients with PD-1 blockade-based combination therapy, without liver metastases and higher level of C-reactive protein (CRP) before PD-1 blockade, is higher than that of those not. Univariate analysis based on clinical features showed that ECOG scores, liver metastasis, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and CRP levels were the factors affecting time to progression (TTP). Multivariate analysis showed that elevated CRP before PD-1 blockade was an independent predictive factor for ORR of PD-1 blockade therapy (=0.009), while only Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score was an independent predictor for TTP (=0.032). The treatment was well tolerated in these cohort patients, and there was no treatment-related death.Anti-PD-1 antibody-containing regimen was safe and effective in Chinese patients with advanced melanoma, and elevated CRP and ECOG score were independent factors predicting the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy.Copyright © 2019 Lingdi Zhao et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652082>Bempegaldesleukin (NKTR-214): a CD-122-biased IL-2 receptor agonist for cancer .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657111>Combinatorial prediction of marker panels from single-cell transcriptomic data.</a></h2><p>Single-cell transcriptomic studies are identifying novel cell populations with exciting functional roles in various in vivo contexts, but identification of succinct gene marker panels for such populations remains a challenge.

During this procedure, autologous tissue is excised, relocated, and reattached using vascular anastomoses at the site of the extirpated breast. The period during which the tissue is ex vivo may allow genetic modification without any systemic exposure to the vector. Could such access be used to deliver therapeutic agents using the tissue flap as a vehicle? Such delivery may be more efficient than systemic treatment, in terms of oncological outcomes. The cytokine interferon gamma (IFNγ) has antitumor effects, but systemic toxicity that could be circumvented if its effect can be localized by delivery of the IFNγ gene via gene therapy to autologous tissue used for breast reconstruction, which then releases IFNγ and exerts anti-tumor effects. In a rat model of loco-regional recurrence (LRR) using both MADB-106-Luc and MAD-MB-231-Luc breast cancer cells, autologous tissue was transduced ex vivo with an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) encoding IFNγ. The therapeutic reconstruction released IFNγ at the LRR site and eliminated cancer cells, significantly decreased tumor burden (P<0.05), and increased survival by 33% (P<0.05) compared to sham reconstruction. Mechanistically, localized IFNγ  stimulated M1 macrophages to target cancer cells within the regional confines of the modified tumor environment.

Treg accumulation in the leukemic hematopoietic microenvironment (LHME) has adverse impacts on patient outcomes. The mechanism and effective methods of disrupting Treg accumulation in the LHME have not been well established. Here, we studied the distribution and characteristics of Tregs in the LHME, investigated the effects of Treg ablation on leukemia progression, explored the mechanisms leading to Treg accumulation, and studied whether blocking Treg migration to the LHME delayed leukemia progression in MLL-AF9-induced mouse acute myeloid leukemia (AML) models using wildtype (WT) and Foxp3 mice. Increased accumulation of more activated Tregs was detected in the LHME. Inducible Treg ablation prolonged the survival of AML mice by promoting the antileukemic effects of CD8 T cells. Furthermore, both local expansion and migration accounted for Treg accumulation in the LHME. Moreover, blocking the CCL3-CCR1/CCR5 and CXCL12-CXCR4 axes inhibited Treg accumulation in the LHME and delayed leukemia progression.

We tested the performance of pTuneos on the melanoma cancer vaccine cohort data and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)-recognized neopeptide data. pTuneos is able to predict the MHC presentation and T cell recognition ability of the candidate neoantigens, and the actual immunogenicity of single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-based neopeptides considering their natural processing and presentation, surpassing the existing tools with a comprehensive and quantitative benchmark of their neoantigen prioritization performance and running time. pTuneos was further tested on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort data as well as the melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohort data undergoing checkpoint blockade . The overall neoantigen immunogenicity score proposed by pTuneos is demonstrated to be a powerful and pan-cancer marker for survival prediction compared to traditional well-established biomarkers.In summary, pTuneos provides the state-of-the-art one-stop and user-friendly solution for prioritizing SNV-based candidate neoepitopes, which could help to advance research on next-generation cancer immunotherapies and personalized cancer vaccines. pTuneos is available at https://github.com/bm2-lab/pTuneos , with a Docker version for quick deployment at https://cloud.docker.com/u/bm2lab/repository/docker/bm2lab/ptuneos .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668486>Automated Good Manufacturing Practice-compliant generation of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells from a complete apheresis product using a hollow-fiber bioreactor system overcomes a major hurdle in the manufacture of dendritic cells for cancer vaccines.</a></h2><p>Although dendritic cell (DC)-based cancer vaccines represent a promising treatment strategy, its exploration in the clinic is hampered due to the need for Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) facilities and associated trained staff for the generation of large numbers of DCs.

Initially, IL-33 was described as an inducer of the humoral immune response, which activated Th2 cells and mast cells involved in modulating inflammation and allergic reactions.

Before its introduction in the market, nivolumab was made available to NSCLC patients through an expanded access program (EAP). Here we present the Italian cohort of patients with non-squamous NSCLC enrolled in a worldwide nivolumab EAP, with subgroup analyses involving elderly patients, patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases and patients receiving nivolumab beyond progression.Pretreated patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC received nivolumab at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks up to 24 months. Efficacy data (investigator-assessed tumour response, progression date and survival) and safety data were collected.1588 patients were treated across 153 Italian centres. Overall response rate and disease control rate were 18% and 44%, respectively; median overall survival (OS) was 11.3 months (95% CI: 10.2-12.4). Elderly patients (≥70 n = 522; ≥75 n = 232) achieved outcomes similar to the global study population; patients with CNS metastases (n = 409) had an OS of 8.6 months (95% CI: 6.4-10.8), and a 1-year OS rate of 43%. Nivolumab was administered beyond progression to 276 patients (26%), 57 of whom achieved subsequent disease control; the median OS of patients receiving nivolumab beyond progression was 16.2 months (95% CI: 14.0-18.4), while 1-year OS rate was 62%.To date, this is the largest clinical experience with nivolumab in a real-world setting. Our data support its use in clinical practice for pretreated non-squamous NSCLC, including patients with older age or CNS metastases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, lack of effect in some patients made it imperative to identify other pathways that are exploited by cancer cells to circumvent immune surveillance, and possibly synergize immune checkpoint treatment in those cases. It has been recently recognized that adenosine levels increase significantly in the tumor microenvironment and that adenosine/adenosine receptors play a powerful role as immunosuppressive and attenuating several effector T cell functions. The two main enzymes responsible for generating adenosine in the microenvironment are the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73, the former utilizes both ATP and ADP and produces AMP while the latter utilizes AMP and generates adenosine. Thus, these two enzymes combined are the major source for the bulk of adenosine produced in the microenvironment. They were shown to be validated targets in oncology leading to several clinical trials that include small molecules as well as antibodies, showing positive and encouraging results in the preclinical arena. Towards the development of novel drugs to target these enzymes, we have developed a platform that can be utilized to monitor the activities of both enzymes in vitro (biochemical) as well as in cells (cell based) assays. We have developed very sensitive and homogenous assays that enabled us to monitor the activity of both enzymes and demonstrate selectivity of known inhibitors as well as monoclonal antibodies. This should speed up screening for novel inhibitors that might lead to more effective cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659314>Teamwork by different T-cell types boosts tumour destruction by .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668650>Anti-PD-1  in advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: A long-awaited breakthrough finally arrives.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658426>CD103 T and Dendritic Cells Indicate a Favorable Prognosis in Oral Cancer.</a></h2><p>T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) that are positive for the tissue-resident marker CD103 play a vital role in antitumor immunity. In this study, multiplexed immunohistochemistry was applied to stain CD103 and the T-cell marker CD8 as well as the DC marker CD11c on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tissues. Then, the density of CD103CD8 and CD103CD11c tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the intratumoral and stromal regions was calculated, and the correlation of CD103CD8 TIL and CD103CD11c TIL density with OSCC patient prognosis was analyzed. The results revealed that CD103CD8 TILs and CD103CD11c TILs were abundant in the stromal region and that increased stromal CD103CD8 TIL and intratumoral CD103CD11c TIL density indicated a favorable prognosis. Moreover, we freshly isolated TILs from OSCC samples and performed flow cytometry to verify that CD103CD8 TILs display a tissue-resident memory T-cell (Trm) phenotype, and we discriminated CD103CD11c TILs from tumor-associated macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652645>Epigenetic Reprogramming for Targeting -Mutant Malignant Gliomas.</a></h2><p>Targeting the epigenome has been considered a compelling treatment modality for several cancers, including gliomas. Nearly 80% of the lower-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas harbor recurrent mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (). Mutant IDH generates high levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) that inhibit various components of the epigenetic machinery, including histone and DNA demethylases. The encouraging results from current epigenetic therapies in hematological malignancies have reinvigorated the interest in solid tumors and gliomas, both preclinically and clinically. Here, we summarize the recent advancements in epigenetic therapy for lower-grade gliomas and discuss the challenges associated with current treatment options. A particular focus is placed on therapeutic mechanisms underlying favorable outcome with epigenetic-based drugs in basic and translational research of gliomas. This review also highlights emerging bridges to combination treatment with respect to epigenetic drugs. Given that epigenetic therapies, particularly DNA methylation inhibitors, increase tumor immunogenicity and antitumor immune responses, appropriate drug combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors may lead to improvement of treatment effectiveness of , ultimately leading to tumor cell eradication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648806>Host-Pathogen Interactions in Coccidioidomycosis: Prognostic Clues and Opportunities for Novel Therapies.</a></h2><p>Coccidioidomycosis (CM) is a systemic fungal disease caused by the dimorphic fungi Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii. In its endemic areas of the United States, CM is growing as a public health challenge with a marked increase in incidence in the last 15 years. Although Coccidioides infection is asymptomatic in most cases, symptomatic pulmonary disease occurs in ~40% and disseminated coccidioidomycosis (DCM) occurs in ~1% of previously healthy children and adults. DCM is markedly more common in immunocompromised people, who often experience life-threatening disease despite use of antifungal medications. Although options for antifungal therapy have improved, lifelong therapy is needed for those who develop coccidioidal meningitis. The purpose of this article was to review the state of antifungal therapy and recent studies of host-pathogen interactions in CM in light of advances in immunomodulatory therapy.The study included a review of PubMed and abstracts of the Coccidioidomycosis Study Group (years 2000-2019).Current therapy for CM relies upon azole and polyene antifungal agents. Murine models and studies of DCM in patients with monogenic primary immunodeficiency states and acquired immunodeficiency have revealed the importance of both innate and adaptive immune responses in the control of infections with Coccidioides species. In particular, defects in sensing of fungi and induction of cellular immune responses have been frequently reported. More recently, polymorphisms in key signaling pathways and in the generation of Th17 and Th1 immune responses have been linked with DCM.Antifungal therapy is sufficient to control disease in most cases of CM, but treatment failure occurs in cases of severe pulmonary disease and nonmeningeal disseminated disease. Lifelong therapy is recommended for meningitis in view of the very high risk of recurrence. Corticosteroid therapy is advised by some experts for severe pulmonary disease and for some neurologic complications of DCM. DCM is only rarely the result of a severe monogenic immunodeficiency. Case studies suggest that reorienting cellular immune responses or augmenting effector immune responses may help resolve DCM. Systematic investigation of  for coccidioidomycosis is advisable and may help to address the recent marked increase in reports of the disease in endemic areas.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In the current study, the authors explored the association between types of fat and survival in patients treated with .A retrospective analysis of 90 patients who were treated with  on phase 1 clinical trials at the Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta, Georgia, from 2009 through 2017 was performed. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were used to measure clinical outcomes. Baseline BMI and radiographic images at the middle of the third lumbar vertebrae were obtained. Fat densities were calculated and converted to indices (subcutaneous fat index [SFI], intermuscular fat index [IFI], and visceral fat index [VFI]) after dividing by height in meters squared. Risk groups were created using recursive partitioning and the regression trees method for SFI and IFI, which were selected by stepwise variable selection among all fat-related variables. The Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier method were used for the association with OS and PFS.The majority of patients (59%) were male and diagnosed with melanoma (33%) or gastrointestinal cancers (22%). The median BMI was 27.4 kg/m , the median SFI was 62.78, the median IFI was 4.06, and the median VFI was 40.53. Low-risk patients (those with an SFI ≥73) had a significantly longer OS (hazard ratio, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.09-0.46 [P < .001]) and PFS (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72 [P = .003]) compared with patients at intermediate risk (those with an SFI <73 and IFI <3.4) and poor risk (those with an SFI <73 and IFI ≥3.4). The Uno concordance statistics were found to be higher for fat risk groups than BMI in predicting OS (0.603 vs 0.574; P = .581) and PFS (0.602 vs 0.586; P = .71).Increased BMI, increased SFI, and decreased IFI may be associated with prolonged survival in patients with cancer who are treated with .

We aimed to study the efficacy, and safety of an immunomodulatory therapeutic agent, diphenylcyclopropenone, while manifesting the association with histopathological features, prognostic factors and side effects. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 98 patients (60 men, 38 women) with alopecia who were referred to the ?Hair Disease Polyclinic? at Department of Dermatology between 2011 and 2015 were included. Together with medical histories and dermatological examinations, all patients were taken a skin biopsy for histopathological examination prior to the therapy. Therapeutic success was evaluated on the basis of hair re-growth percentage. Results Regarding the overall treatment success, 33 (34%) patients had complete response, 16 (16%) patients had partial response (between 50-99%), 27 (28%) patients had minimal response (between 1-49%), and 22 (22%) patients were non-responders. Both genders were equally represented in the outcome. Conclusions There was a significant relation between the severity of alopecia and treatment outcome. (p=0.038) Patients with alopecia areata had significantly better response when compared to alopecia totalis and universalis. There was no statistically significant relation with other parameters such as disease duration, age, gender, atopy history, age of onset, and histopathological features.</p></html>
