O-methylguanine (O-Me-G) was used as a simple model adduct to calculate theoretical spectra for comparison with measured high-resolution fragmentation data. An automatic protocol was established to consider the different tautomers accessible at a given  and obtain final theoretical spectra by insertion of an initial tautomer. In the work reported here, the most stable tautomer was chosen as the initial structure, but in general, any structure could be considered. Allowing for the formation of the various possible tautomers during simulation calculations was found to be important to getting a more complete fragmentation spectrum. The calculated theoretical results reproduce the experimental peaks such that it was possible to determine reaction pathways and product structures. The calculated tautomerization network was crucial to correctly identifying all the observed ion peaks, showing that a mobile proton model holds not only for peptide fragmentation but also for nucleobases. Finally, first principles results were compared to simple machine learning fragmentation models.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693969>Energetic, economic and environmental assessment for the anaerobic digestion of pretreated and codigested press mud.</a></h2><p>This study investigates the feasibility of anaerobic digestion (AD) of press mud previously pretreated, using two methods: Liquid Hot Water (LHW) and Thermo-Alkaline (TA), from an economic, energetic and environmental point of view. Two scenarios, a sugar mill with and without distillery were studied, considering monodigestion and vinasse codigestion. The results have shown that the LHW and TA pretreatments are self-sufficient in terms of thermal requirements since they can recover heat from the biogas engine, but the maximum electric and thermal net  (64 MWh d and 95 MWh d, respectively) was obtained during co-digestion with vinasse. The results of the environmental Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) show that the alternatives improve the environmental profiles, in both scenarios. The endpoint impact category "Human health" had the highest contribution because of both: the burning of fossil fuel at refinery to supply the required electricity; and the production of Ca(OH) when vinasse was fed. The AD of pretreated press mud by LHW in CSTR reactors was the most viable for the scenario of a sugar mill without distillery, while the alternative co-digestion with the vinasse of the press mud without pretreatment was the most viable for the scenario of a sugar mill with distillery. This research shows that both the environmental and energetic profiles and the profitability of methane production can improve when the pretreatment and co-digestion of these wastes from the sugar - alcohol production process are considered.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Molecular docking demonstrated the most possible binding mode of Neratinib-MAD2L1 and the potential binding sites and interaction forces of the interaction between MAD2L1 and Neratinib. Fluorescence spectroscopy experiments manifested that Neratinib could interact with MAD2L1 and form a complex by hydrogen bond and van der Waals interaction. These results were consistent with the conclusions obtained from molecular docking. In addition, according to Synchronous fluorescence and three-dimensional fluorescence results, Neratinib might lead to the conformational change of MAD2L1, which may affect the biological functions of MAD2L1.

Sclerostin is an osteocyte-derived negative regulator of bone formation. We aimed to assess serum sclerostin level as a bone marker in children with CKD on regular hemodialysis (HD) and detect the association between this and bone density status. This cross-sectional comparative study was conducted on 25 children with CKD on HD and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy children, as controls. Their ages ranged from 4 to 18 years. Serum sclerostin levels were measured and dual- X-ray absorptiometry scan was performed in the same line with the traditional bone markers. There was a significant increase in serum sclerostin level in patients (1.754 ± 1.31 ng/mL) compared to controls (0.290 ± 0.074 ng/mL) with P = 0.001. Nine patients (36%) had low bone mineral density (BMD) with z score under -2.0, eight of whom had low BMD in both the neck of femur and lumbar spines. There was a significant increase in serum sclerostin levels in the patient-group with low BMD (2.38 ± 0.85 ng/mL) compared with patients with normal BMD (1.4 ± 0.98 ng/mL) (P = 0.001). A significant positive correlation was found between serum sclerostin level and alkaline phosphtase, parathormone with negative correlation with serum calcium. Sclerostin was 100% specific and sensitive in predicting CKD-mineral and bone disorder. Elevated sclerostin levels were consistent with low BMD and appear to be an independent predictor of reduced BMD in children on regular HD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697299>Boosting the potassium-ion storage performance of a carbon anode by chemically regulating oxygen-containing species.</a></h2><p>The oxygen-containing species in melamine foam carbons are chemically regulated by oxidizing-acid treatment.

The nanoparticles are considered to be distributed randomly within an implicit solid matrix, but with the easy axes distributed according to particular textures: these are aligned parallel or perpendicular to an external magnetic field, or randomly distributed. The magnetic properties are calculated as functions of the magnetic crystallographic anisotropy barrier (measured with respect to the thermal  by a parameter σ), and the Langevin susceptibility (related to the dipolar coupling constant and the volume fraction). It is shown that the initial susceptibility χ is independent of σ in the random case, an increasing function of σ in the parallel case, and a decreasing function of σ in the perpendicular case. Including particle-particle interactions enhances χ, and especially so in the parallel case. A first-order modified mean-field (MMF1) theory is accurate as compared to the simulation results, except in the parallel case with a large value of σ. These observations can be explained in terms of the range and strength of the (effective) interactions and correlations between particles, and the effects of the orientational degrees of freedom. The full magnetization curves show that a parallel texture enhances the magnetization, while a perpendicular texture suppresses it, with the effects growing with increasing σ. In the random case, while the initial response is independent of σ, the high-field magnetization decreases with increasing σ. These trends can be explained by the  required to rotate the magnetic moments with respect to the easy axes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694009>Technical advances in X-ray microbeam radiation therapy.</a></h2><p>In the last 25 years Microbeam Radiation Therapy (MRT) has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional radiation therapy at large, third generation synchrotrons. In MRT, a multi-slit collimator modulates a kilovoltage X-ray beam on a micrometer scale, creating peak dose areas with unconventionally high doses of several hundred Grays separated by low dose valley regions, where the dose remains well below the tissue tolerance level. Pre-clinical evidence demonstrates that such beam geometries lead to substantially reduced damage to normal tissue at equal tumour control rates and hence drastically increase the therapeutic window. Although the mechanisms behind MRT are still to be elucidated, previous studies indicate that immune response, tumour microenvironment, and the microvasculature may play a crucial role. Beyond tumour therapy, MRT has also been suggested as a microsurgical tool in neurological disorders and as a primer for drug delivery. The physical properties of MRT demand innovative medical physics and engineering solutions for safe treatment delivery. This article reviews technical developments in MRT and discusses existing solutions for dosimetric validation, reliable treatment planning and safety. Instrumentation at synchrotron facilities, including beam production, collimators and patient positioning systems, is also discussed. Specific solutions reviewed in this article include: dosimetry techniques that can cope with high spatial resolution, low photon energies and extremely high dose rates of up to \SI{15000}{Gy/s}, dose calculation algorithms - apart from pure Monte Carlo Simulations - to overcome the challenge of small voxel sizes and a wide dynamic dose-range, and the use of dose-enhancing nanoparticles to combat the limited penetrability of a kilovoltage  spectrum. Finally, concepts for alternative compact microbeam sources are presented, such as inverse Compton scattering set-ups and carbon nanotube x-ray tubes, that may facilitate the transfer of MRT into a hospital-based clinical environment. Intensive research in recent years has resulted in practical solutions to most of the technical challenges in MRT. Treatment planning, dosimetry and patient safety systems at synchrotrons have matured to a point that first veterinary and clinical studies in MRT are within reach. Should these studies confirm the promising results of pre-clinical studies, the authors are confident that MRT will become an effective new radiotherapy option for certain patients.© 2019 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698155>Characterization of the low-lying electronic states of tin monohydride cation including the spin-orbit coupling effect: A theoretical perspective.</a></h2><p>High-level ab initio computations have been performed on SnH.

In order to accomplish this, the factors influencing these decomposition characteristics such as background gases (air, N, and He), residence time (1-10 s), initial -hexane concentration (10-50 ppm), relative humidity (2.5, 40, and 70%), and power (50-80 W) were evaluated. As a result, the decomposition efficiency of -hexane at N atmosphere was found to be lower than those at air and He atmosphere. The removal efficiency of -hexane was increased when the residence time, relative humidity, and power increased, and when the initial concentration decreased. The concentrations of CO, CO, and aerosol increased as the specific  density increased. However, the O level increased up to a certain point, then decreased.

Texture results showed that by adding 1% (w/w) ground ginger, hardness of dough, hardness and chewiness of biscuit decreased, which was beneficial for biscuit making. Moreover, the L* value of biscuit dropped while the a* and b* value rose with the increase of ginger contents, indicating darker, redder and yellower biscuits. Sensory score of biscuits became worse but acrylamide content reduced with the addition of ground ginger.

By placing a π-electron-donating hydroxyl group between two radical sites, their reactivity can be quenched by enhancing their through-space coupling via a favorable resonance structure. Indeed, 3-hydroxy-2,4,6-tridehydropyridinium cation () abstracts only one atom or group of atoms from reagents. On the other hand, an electron-withdrawing cyano group between two of the radical sites () destabilizes the analogous resonance structure and diminishes through-space coupling between the radical sites, resulting in abstraction of three atoms, just like . However, the cyano-substituent also increases acidity to the point that  reacts pre-dominantly via proton transfer instead of undergoing radical reactions. Therefore, acidic triradicals may undergo nonradical, barrierless proton transfer reactions faster than radical reactions, which are usually accompanied by barriers. Examination of the analogous cyano-substituted mono-and biradicals revealed behavior similar to that of the corresponding unsubstituted species, with the exception of substantially greater reactivities due to their greater (calculated) vertical electron affinities. Finally, the 3-cyano-2,6-didehydropyridinium cation with a singlet ground state (S-T splitting: -11.9 kcal mol) was found to react exclusively from the lowest- triplet state by fast proton transfer reactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696958>Inhibition effect of polyvinyl chloride on ferrihydrite reduction and electrochemical activities of Geobacter metallireducens.</a></h2><p>Geobacter metallireducens GS15, a model of dissimilatory iron-reducing bacteria, is the key regulator in biogeochemical iron cycling. How the emerging contaminant microplastics involved in the iron cycling are driven by microbes on the microscale remains unknown. Hence, the influences of two typical microplastics, polybutylene terephthalate-hexane acid (PBAT) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), were explored on the activity of G. metallireducens GS15 with ferrihydrite or ferric citrate as the respective electron acceptors. The results showed that the iron (II) contents in PBAT- and PVC-treatment groups were 16.79 and 6.81 mM, respectively, at the end of the experiment. Compared with the PBAT-treatment group, scanning electron microscopy and  dispersive spectrometery revealed that merely a small amount of iron-containing products covered the surface of PVC. Moreover, PBAT and PVC could both retard the electroactivity of G. metallireducens GS15 at the beginning of microbial fuel cell operation. On the basis of the results above, microplastic PVC might exhibit potential inhibition of the iron cycling process driven by G. metallireducens GS15 with ferrihydrite as the terminal electron acceptor. This study extended our understanding of the influence of the microplastics PBAT and PVC on microbially mediated biogeochemical iron cycling. The findings might have an important implication on the biogeochemical elements cycling in the ecosystem with the involvement of emerging contaminant microplastics.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To gain further insight into the nature and strength of these effects, we use the Interacting Quantum Atoms (IQA) method augmented with the semiclassical pairwise dispersion potential to decompose the conformational energies of fluoro-substituted molecules into fragment-based  contributions, which include deformation/distortion terms and the electrostatic, exchange-correlation and dispersion interactions. The studied molecules comprise various F-CH2-CH2-X and F-CH2-CO-X systems, as well as selected conformers of an α,β-difluoro-γ-amino-acid derivative that is potentially useful for the design of shape-controlled bioactive amino acids and peptides. We identify the most relevant exchange-correlation and/or electrostatic interaction terms contributing to the stability of the various conformers, and we show that IQA can be used to assess the gauche/anti or trans/cis preferences in molecules with two or more rotatable bonds as well as to study the roles played by other concomitant effects (e.g., CH/OH/NHF contacts).

In this work, a facile method named ultrasound-promoted synthesis was developed to fabricate γ-graphyne using PhBr and CaC as the raw materials. The reaction system in argon atmosphere ultrasonically vibrated for 24 h in the ultrasonic bath at a power of 180 W and frequency of 53 kHz. The structure, morphology, and component of the obtained samples were detected by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, FT-IR spectra, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and the selected area electron diffraction. The electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements indicate that γ-graphyne can be used as superior electrode mateirals in supercapacitor and photoelectrochemical catalysis. From the results of galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements, the γ-graphyne supercapacitor delivers a maximum specific capacitance of 81 F/g at 0.2 A/g and a capacitance retention rate of 87.5% after 5000 cycles at 3 A/g. Moreover, UV-vis light photoelectrochemical response and high carrier density are observed for γ-graphyne. It is also demonstrated that the charge-transfer resistance is low by Tafel slopes and Nyquist plots.

Herein, we fabricate the BiOCl nanosheet/graphene hybrid with 2D heterojunction through a hydrothermal and physical mixing two-step process. Studies on the heterostructure reveal the face-to-face intimate interfacial contact between the BiOCl nanosheet and graphene through Van der Waals interaction rather than chemical bonding. Compare with BiOCl bulk/graphene hybrid, the BiOCl nanosheet/graphene hybrid showed superior photocatalytic activity towards dye decolorization and decomposition, features a remarkable enhancement of 15-fold higher reaction rate. A series of characterizations reveal that the co-effect of the surface defect of BiOCl nanosheet and graphene planar structure contribute to an extended light absorption range, better electrical conductivity, and larger dye adsorption capacity. Furthermore, the unique face-to-face interface guarantee intimate contact between graphene and BiOCl promoted the fast and continuous consumption of photogenerated electrons, thereby effectively facilitating the separation of electron-hole pairs.

The use of plasma  as a treatment option is a relatively new concept and little data is currently available on this method. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of the use of plasma  in our daily clinical practice by looking at various postoperative outcomes.Twenty-one women previously diagnosed with uni- or bilateral ovarian endometriomas by transvaginal ultrasound, associated with pelvic pain and/or infertility, were included in this retrospective cohort study performed in a tertiary endometriosis referral centre. All women underwent endometriotic cyst ablation using plasma . At follow up postoperative pain, number of days until return to work following surgery, postoperative pregnancy rate and recurrence rate were determined.This study demonstrates a significant decrease in the proportion of patients reporting pain postoperatively when comparing the number of patients with dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain pre- and postoperatively. In addition, the median number of days until women returned to work postoperatively was 9 days (interquartile range (IQR) 8-11 days). The postoperative pregnancy rate was 46.2% (6 of 13 women wishing to conceive) and the recurrence rate was 9.5%.In conclusion, plasma  is a promising alternative to stripping cystectomy, as comparable results for postoperative pregnancy and recurrence rates can be observed.

The polarization dependence on the hyperons' emission angle relative to the elliptic flow plane exhibits a second harmonic sine modulation, indicating a quadrupole pattern of the vorticity component along the beam direction, expected due to elliptic flow. The polarization is found to increase in more peripheral collisions, and shows no strong transverse momentum (p_{T}) dependence at p_{T} greater than 1  GeV/c. The magnitude of the signal is about 5 times smaller than those predicted by hydrodynamic and multiphase transport models; the observed phase of the emission angle dependence is also opposite to these model predictions.

Estrogen deficiency is the primary reason for trabecular bone loss in postmenopausal women. By reducing estrogen levels aromatase inhibitors (AI) as part of breast cancer therapy promote bone loss. Bisphosphonates (BP) are recommended to counteract this adverse drug effect. The purpose of our study was to quantify VBM proton density fat fraction (PDFF) changes at the lumbar spine using chemical shift encoding-based water-fat MRI (CSE-MRI) and bone mineral density (BMD) changes using dual  X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) related to AI and BP treatment over a 12-month period.Twenty seven postmenopausal breast cancer patients receiving AI therapy were recruited for this study. 22 subjects completed the 12-month study. 14 subjects received AI and BP (AI+BP), 8 subjects received AI without BP (AI-BP). All subjects underwent 3 T MRI. An eight-echo 3D spoiled gradient-echo sequence was used for CSE-based water-fat separation at the lumbar spine to generate PDFF maps. After manual segmentation of the vertebral bodies L1-L5 PDFF values were extracted for each vertebra and averaged for each subject. All subjects underwent DXA of the lumbar spine measuring the average BMD of L1-L4.Baseline age, PDFF and BMD showed no significant difference between the two groups (p > 0.05). There was a relative longitudinal increase in mean PDFF (∆rel) in both groups (AI+BP: 5.93%; AI-BP: 3.11%) which was only significant (p = 0.006) in the AI+BP group. ∆rel showed no significant difference between the two groups (p > 0.05). There was no significant longitudinal change in BMD (p > 0.05).Over a 12-month period, VBM PDFF assessed with CSE-MRI significantly increased in subjects receiving AI and BP.

Fused Colloidal Nanopatterning combines directed self-assembly and controlled fusing of spherical colloidal nanoparticles. The two-step approach first patterns a surface covered with hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ), an electron beam resist, forming traps into which the colloidal gold nanoparticles self-assemble. Secondly, the patterned nanoparticles are controllably fused to form plasmon resonators of any 2D designed shape. The heights and widths of the plasmon resonators are determined by the diameter of the nanoparticle building blocks, which can be well below 10 nm. By performing the fusing-step with UV-ozone and heat exposure, we demonstrate that the process is easily scalable to cover large areas on silicon wafers with designed gold nanostructures. The procedure neither requires adhesion layers, nor a lift-off process, making it ideally-suited for plasmonics, in comparison with regular electron beam lithography. We use monochromated electron -loss spectroscopy (EELS) in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) as well as boundary-element method simulations to demonstrate that the designed plasmon resonators are directly tunable via the pattern design. We foresee future expansion of this approach for applications such as plasmon-enhanced photocatalysis, and for large-scale patterning where chemical, optical, or confinement properties require sub-10 nm metal lines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696998>Electronic Metal-Support Interaction-Modified Structures and Catalytic Activity of CeO Overlayers in CeO /Ag Inverse Catalysts.</a></h2><p>Invited for the cover of this issue is Weixin Huang and co-workers at the University of Science and Technology of China.

Many Archaea maintain the fluidity and permeability of their membranes by adjusting the number of cyclic moieties within the cores of their glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) lipids. Cyclized GDGTs increase membrane packing and stability, which has been shown to help cells survive shifts in temperature and pH.

These observations indicate a relationship between  metabolism and membrane composition. Here we show that the average degree of GDGT cyclization increases with doubling time in continuous cultures of the thermoacidophile Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (DSM 639). This is consistent with the behavior of a mesoneutrophile, Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1. Together, these results demonstrate that archaeal GDGT distributions can shift in response to electron donor flux and  availability, independent of pH or temperature. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on GDGTs thus capture the  available to microbes, which encompasses fluctuations in temperature and pH, as well as electron donor and acceptor availability. The ability of Archaea to adjust membrane composition and packing may be an important strategy that enables survival during episodes of  stress. This article is protected by copyright.

In this search, it is assumed that the H^{+} boson is produced in decays of top quarks, and the A boson decays to two oppositely charged muons. The presence of signals for H^{+} boson masses between 100 and 160 GeV and A boson masses between 15 and 75 GeV is investigated. No evidence for the production of the H^{+} boson is found. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are obtained on the combined branching fraction for the decay chain, t→bH^{+}→bW^{+}A→bW^{+}μ^{+}μ^{-}, of 1.9×10^{-6} to 8.6×10^{-6}, depending on the masses of the H^{+} and A bosons.

However, the cause of the wide-spread device properties found experimentally in various MTJ stacks, including tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR), perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), and voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA), remains elusive. Here, using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and -dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, we found that the MTJ crystallization quality, boron diffusion out of the CoFeB fixed layer, and minimal CoFe oxidation correlate with the TMR. As with the CoFeB free layer, seed layer diffusion into the free layer/MgO interface is negatively correlated with the interfacial PMA, while the metal-oxides concentrations in the free layer correlate with the VCMA. Combined with formation enthalpy and thermal diffusion analysis, we further established a predictive materials design framework to guide the complex design space explorations for high-performance MTJs. Based on this framework, we demonstrate experimentally high PMA and VCMA values of 1.74 mJ/m2 and 115 fJ/V-m with annealing stability above 400 °C.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694221>A Versatile Porous Silver-Coordinated Material for the Heterogeneous Catalysis of Chemical Conversion with Propargylic Alcohols and CO.</a></h2><p>The efficient transformation of carbon dioxide into useful chemical feedstock is of great significance, attracting intense research interest. The widely studied porous-coordinated polymers possess large pores to adsorb guest molecules and further allow the contact and to transfer the substrate molecule within their microenvironment. Here we present the synthesis of a silver-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) material with a three-dimensional structure by incorporating a tetraphenyl-ethylene moiety as the four-point connected node via the solvothermal method. This polymer exhibits as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the carboxylative cyclization of CO to α-methylene cyclic carbonates in excellent yields.

Previous studies of the potential for mitigating non-CO GHG emissions in China have focused on timeframes through only 2030, or only on certain sectors or gases. This study uses a novel bottom-up end-use model to estimate mitigation of China's non-CO GHGs under a Mitigation Scenario whereby today's cost-effective and technologically feasible CO and non-CO mitigation measures are deployed through 2050. The study determines that future non-CO GHG emissions are driven largely by industrial and agricultural sources and that China could reduce those emissions by 47% by 2050 while enabling total GHG emissions to peak by 2023. Except for F-gas mitigation, few national or sectoral policies have focused on reducing non-CO GHGs. Policy, market, and other institutional support are needed to realize the cost-effective mitigation potentials identified in this study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698345>Optical absorption and excitation spectra of monolayer blue phosphorene.</a></h2><p>We study the optical absorption and excitation spectra of monolayer blue phosphorene with two approaches. The first one is based on the GWapproximation in conjunction with the Bethe-Salpeter equation theory. The second one is based on the time-dependent density-functional theory in the adiabatic local density approximation and the random phase approximation. The spectra from the two approaches are quite similar. The optical absorption spectrum is dominated by a single peak at 4.2 eV, which originates from direct interband transitions at the Γ point of the Brillouin zone. The excitation spectrum is dominated by a plasmon peak at 9.2 eV, which arises from collective excitations of valence electrons. The plasmon shows a positive dispersion at finite momentum transfer. The in-plane electron is responsible for the optical absorption, whereas the out-of-plane electron is responsible for the plasmon dispersion. Monolayer blue phosphorene has an indirect band gap of 2.98 eV and an exciton binding  of 1.03 eV.© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693833>Enhanced lipid production of  sp.

HS2, which previously showed excellent performance in phototrophic cultivation and has a tolerance for a wide range of salinity, pH, and temperature, was cultivated heterotrophically. The conventional medium was newly optimized based on a composition analysis using elemental analysis and ICP-OES. In addition, in order to maintain a favorable dissolved oxygen level, step-wisely elevated revolutions per minute was adopted. These optimizations led to 40 and 13% increases in the biomass and lipid productivity, respectively (7.0 and 2.25 g Ld each). Furthermore, in order to increase the lipid content, 12 h heat shock at 50 °C was applied and this enhanced the biomass and lipid productivity up to 4 and 17% respectively (7.3 and 2.64 g Ld, each) relative to the optimized conditions above, and the values were 17 and 14% higher than ordinary lipid accumulating N-limitation (6.2 and 2.31 g Ld). On this basis, heat shock was successfully adopted in novel  sp. HS2 cultivation as a lipid inducer for the first time.

This study investigates the characteristic functional properties of CNFs extracted via total chlorine-free (TCF) bleached kenaf fiber followed by an eco-friendly supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO) treatment process. The Fourier transmission infra-red FTIR spectra result gave remarkable effective delignification of the kenaf fiber as the treatment progressed. TEM images showed that the extracted CNFs have a diameter in the range of 10-15 nm and length of up to several micrometers, and thereby proved that the supercritical carbon dioxide pretreatment followed by mild acid hydrolysis is an efficient technique to extract CNFs from the plant biomass. XRD analysis revealed that crystallinity of the fiber was enhanced after each treatment and the obtained crystallinity index of the raw fiber, alkali treated fiber, bleached fiber, and cellulose nanofiber were 33.2%, 54.6%, 88.4%, and 92.8% respectively. SEM images showed that amorphous portions like hemicellulose and lignin were removed completely after the alkali and bleaching treatment, respectively. Moreover, we fabricated a series of cellulose nanopapers using the extracted CNFs suspension via a simple vacuum filtration technique. The fabricated cellulose nanopaper exhibited a good tensile strength of 75.7 MPa at 2.45% strain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696977>Sensitive Wearable Temperature Sensor with Seamless Monolithic Integration.</a></h2><p>Accurate temperature field measurement provides critical information in many scientific problems. Herein, a new paradigm for highly sensitive, flexible, negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor-based artificial skin is reported, with the highest temperature sensing ability reported to date among previously reported NTC thermistors. This artificial skin is achieved through the development of a novel monolithic laser-induced reductive sintering scheme and unique monolithic structures. The unique seamless monolithic structure simultaneously integrates two different components (a metal electrode and metal oxide sensing channel) from the same material at ambient pressure, which cannot be achieved by conventional heterogeneous integration through multiple, complex steps of photolithography or vacuum deposition. In addition to superior performance, electronic skin with high temperature sensitivity can be fabricated on heat-sensitive polymer substrates due to the low-temperature requirements of the process. As a proof of concept, temperature-sensitive artificial skin is tested with conformally attachable physiological temperature sensor arrays in the measurement of the temperatures of exhaled breath for the early detection of pathogenic progression in the respiratory system. The proposed highly sensitive flexible temperature sensor and monolithic selective laser reductive sintering are expected to greatly contribute to the development of essential components in various emerging research fields, including soft robotics and healthcare systems.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The aim of this study was to investigate time trends in dietary patterns and nutrient intake in an older population, in order to increase the understanding of whether dietary recommendations are followed and if nutrient needs are met.Cross-sectional data was derived from five samples of 70-year-olds examined 1971-72, 1981-83, 1992-93, 2000-02 and 2014-16 from the Gothenburg H70 birth cohort studies in Sweden. A total of 2246 individuals (56% women) participated. Dietary intake was determined by the diet history method, which is an interview including questions on usual frequencies and portion sizes of food intake during the preceding three months. Recommended values of nutrient intake and determinants of healthful dietary patterns were based on the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations 2012. Statistical analyses were performed using general linear models, student's t-test and chi-square test, stratified by sex.The intake of fruits and vegetables, fish and seafood, whole grain products and nuts and seeds increased during the study period (p < 0.0001), among both sexes. However, there was also an increase in alcohol intake (p < 0.0001), especially from wine and beer, and in 2014-16 more than 30% had an alcohol intake above recommendations. Protein intake increased (p < 0.0001 for women and p = 0.0004 for men), and 48% of the women and 37% of the men had a protein intake above recommended 1.2 g/kg body weight and day in 2014-16. The proportion of participants at risk of inadequate intake of vitamins C, D and folate decreased during the study period, among both sexes (p < 0.0001). However, vitamin D intake from diet was still below average requirement level of 7.5 μg/day for 49% of the women and 32% of the men in 2014-16.Dietary patterns have changed among 70-year-olds during the past five decades, with an increase in healthful foods and a higher nutrient density in later born birth cohorts. However, the intake of alcohol increased, especially among women. Results from this study can be useful as a basis for dietary guidelines and used for prevention strategies involving older adults in population-based and health care settings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697300>Ab initio accelerated molecular dynamics study of the hydride ligands in the ruthenium complex: Ru(H)H(P(CH)).</a></h2><p>The dihydrogen complex Ru(H2)2H2(P(C5H9)3)2 has been investigated, via ab initio accelerated molecular dynamics, to elucidate the H ligands dynamics and possible reaction paths for H2/H exchange.

We investigated the influence of water stress on the photosynthetic processes in Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris, two species with contrasting drought sensitivities. Spruce and pine seedlings were exposed to polyethylene glycol 6000-induced water deficits of different intensities and durations. The maintenance of photosystem I (PSI) oxidation in spruce required increased photosynthetic control and led to the increased reduction of the plastoquinone pool, which was not the case in pine seedlings. As a result of increased excitation pressure, photosystem II (PSII) inactivation was observed in spruce plants, whereas in pine, the decreased PSII photochemistry was likely due to sustained non-photochemical quenching. Downregulation of PSII photochemistry and maintenance of PSI in an oxidized state were linked with the prevention of oxidative stress, even under severe water deficit. The decreased photosynthetic pigment content and photosynthetic gene expression suggested the coordinated downregulation of photosynthetic apparatus components under water stress to reduce light  absorption. In summary, the observed adaptative mechanisms of pine and spruce to water stress may be similar to the well-studied adaptative mechanisms to winter stress, which may indicate the universality of protective mechanisms under various stresses in conifers.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We have previously found that the lower limb is more often injured at work among women, compared to men, so the paper concentrates on lower limb injuries.Using the records of the National Institute for Insurance against Injuries at Work (INAIL), we focused on the non-vehicle commuting accidents of women and men recognized as work-related for the period 2013-2017. In particular, we examined the gender difference by work sector and type of trauma suffered with particular attention to lower limb injuries.The rate of non-vehicle commuting accidents (n. 60,936) among women was significantly higher than for men (1.29‰ vs 0.40‰ men, p < 0.001) for the period studied. Lower limb injuries (50.5% for women and 43.7% for men, p < 0.001) constituted the large majority of these injuries. In particular, dislocation of the ankle (78% for women vs 65.5% for men, p < 0.001), bruise of the knee (71.2% for women vs 54.9% for men, p < 0.001) and fracture of the foot (41% for women vs 33.6% for men, p < 0.001) were all significantly higher among women. The work sectors with higher injury rates were: Transport and Warehouse, Public Administration, Health and care services and Wholesale and retail trade. This result may be due to wear and tear from conditions at work. The women injured were on the average, a decade older than men (50-59 vs 40-49 years old).Non-vehicle commuting represents an important, albeight neglected, preventable risk for women workers, causing lower limb trauma particularly at the ankle, the foot and the knee. These areas may be particularly injure-prone among women in specific sectors, due to the work environment. Effective prevention of these injuries requires gender-oriented ergonomic actions at work and in the commuting environment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

When doping 10% SM-Cl in SM:IDIC binary system, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ternary solar cell was dramatically increased from 9.39% to 10.29%. Characterization studies indicated that the two donors tend to form an alloy state, which effectively down-shifted the HOMO  level of the donor, and thus promoting a higher open-circuit voltage. Interestingly, incorporating a third component (SM-Cl) with lower crystallinity was proven to facilitate the demixing between donors and acceptors, which was in contrary to the traditional findings of enhanced phase separation through incorporation of highly crystalline molecule. Although the morphological modulation had always been a bottleneck issue in NFSM-OSCs, the findings in this work indicated that the modulation on crystallinity deviation between donors and acceptors could be an effective method to further improve the performance of NFSM-OSCs, providing a new perspective on NFSM-OSCs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698218>Gold nanoparticles synthesized with Smilax glabra rhizome modulates the anti-obesity parameters in high-fat diet and streptozotocin induced obese diabetes rat model.</a></h2><p>Diabetes is a major emerging health consequence across the world which directly associated with the obesity. Contemporary anti-diabetic drugs have numeral limitations, and investigation of herbal remedies for diabetes give novel guide for the expansion of new drugs that can be used as harmonizing to present anti-diabetic allopathic medications. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of 21 nm have been formerly well portrayed in vitro for their capability to intend active uptake in cell.

Herein, we reported a non-flammable and high-voltage-tolerated polymer electrolyte (HVTPE) with extended voltage of 5.5 V. The obtained HVTPE has lower HOMO  indicating a higher anti-oxidation ability, which avoids the decomposition and depletion of electrolyte near cathode. Significantly, the HVTPE-based 4.45 V-class LiCoO2 battery delivered a high capacity of 173.2 mAh g-1 at 0.05 C. Using 4.9 V-class LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 as cathode, the battery exhibited stable cycling performance. Moreover, HVTPE showed a high modulus of 2.3 GPa, which can efficiently restrain the penetration of Li dendrites, and desirable non-flammable feature, leading to the enhanced safety based on polymer electrolytes.

The MFC supplement (658 mg flavonoids, split dose 8:30, 13:00) contained quercetin, green tea catechins, and anthocyanins from bilberry extract, and 214 mg caffeine. Participants were measured twice in a metabolic chamber for a day, four weeks apart, with outcomes including 22 h EE (8:30-6:30), substrate utilization from the respiratory quotient (RQ), plasma caffeine levels (16:00), and genotyping for the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs762551. Areas under the curve (AUC) for metabolic data from the MFC and PL trials were calculated using the trapezoid rule, with a mixed linear model (GLM) used to evaluate the overall treatment effect. The 22 h oxygen consumption and EE were significantly higher with MFC than PL (1582 ± 143, 1535 ± 154 kcal/day, respectively,  = 0.003, trial difference of 46.4 ± 57.8 kcal/day). FATox trended higher for MFC when evaluated using GLM (99.2 ± 14.0, 92.4 ± 14.4 g/22 h,  = 0.054). Plasma caffeine levels were significantly higher in the MFC versus PL trial (5031 ± 289, 276 ± 323 ng/mL, respectively,  < 0.001). Trial differences for 22 h EE and plasma caffeine were unrelated after controlling for age and body mass ( = -0.249,  = 0.139), and not different for participants with the homozygous allele 1, A/A, compared to C/A and C/C ( = 0.50 and 0.56, respectively). In conclusion, EE was higher for MFC compared to PL, and similar to effects estimated from previous trials using caffeine alone. A small effect of the MFC on FATox was measured, in contrast to inconsistent findings previously reported for this caffeine dose. The trial variance for 22 h EE was not significantly related to the variance in plasma caffeine levels or CYP1A2*1F allele carriers and non-carriers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694146>Relevance of Leptin and Other Adipokines in Obesity-Associated Cardiovascular Risk.</a></h2><p>Obesity, which is a worldwide epidemic, confers increased risk for multiple serious conditions including type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular diseases. Adipose tissue is considered one of the largest endocrine organs in the body as well as an active tissue for cellular reactions and metabolic homeostasis rather than an inert tissue only for  storage. The functional pleiotropism of adipose tissue relies on its ability to synthesize and release a large number of hormones, cytokines, extracellular matrix proteins, and growth and vasoactive factors, which are collectively called adipokines known to influence a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes. In the obese state, excessive visceral fat accumulation causes adipose tissue dysfunctionality that strongly contributes to the onset of obesity-related comorbidities. The mechanisms underlying adipose tissue dysfunction include adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia, increased inflammation, impaired extracellular matrix remodeling, and fibrosis together with an altered secretion of adipokines.

Here we employ a two-dimensional lattice Hamiltonian with a single, spin-degenerate Dirac cone, which exactly reproduces a linear -momentum relation for all finite size lattice momenta in the absence of interactions. This allows us to significantly reduce finite size corrections compared to the widely studied honeycomb and π-flux lattices. A Hubbard term dynamically generates a mass beyond a critical coupling of U_{c}=6.76(1) as the system acquires antiferromagnetic order and SU(2) spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken. At the quantum phase transition, we extract a self-consistent set of critical exponents ν=0.98(1), η_{ϕ}=0.53(1), η_{ψ}=0.18(1), and β=0.75(1). We provide evidence for the continuous degradation of the quasiparticle weight of the fermionic excitations as the critical point is approached from the semimetallic phase. Finally, we study the effective "speed of light" of the low- relativistic description, which depends on the interaction U, but is expected to be regular across the quantum phase transition. We illustrate that the strongly coupled bosonic and fermionic excitations share a common velocity at the critical point.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693952>Trends in ammonia emissions from light-duty gasoline vehicles in China, 1999-2017.</a></h2><p>Ammonia (NH) emitted from motor vehicles is a by-product of measures taken to reduce emissions of other pollutants (e.g. NOx and CO) and has potentially important environmental impacts. NH levels can be impacted by various emission standards. However, there is a lack of investigations of the influences from the implementation of different vehicular emission standards on long-term changes in NH emissions. To fill this gap, we estimated the inter-annual NH emissions of light-duty gasoline vehicles (LDGVs) under different emission standards (State 0 to State V) from 1999 to 2017 and investigated the emission change characteristics under the rapidly developing Chinese economy. Results showed that the NH emissions from LDGVs had a sharp, 42-fold increase (from 1.8Gg to 77.9Gg). However, NH emissions per capita have begun to decrease with increases in socioeconomic development, presenting an inverted U-shaped tendency as a function of per capita GDP. Further exploration indicated that the decline in emission factors, as determined by upgrades in emission standards, was the decisive factor in promoting the downward trend in per capita emissions. This suggests that continuously upgrading emission standards has offset the increase in NH emissions due to the rapid growth of motor vehicles. Quantitative scenario analysis showed a two-stage impact of emission standards on NH emissions: emissions would decrease 77% (48%-90% for different years) if State I and State II were not implemented; while if none of standards were upgraded (State III to State V), NH emissions would increase 118% (13%-224% for different years), 2-6 times the impacts from the growth of vehicle population and the decline of vehicle kilometres traveled. The data and findings in this study can provide scientific support for understanding air pollution in urban areas and for formulating further vehicle pollution mitigation measures in China and other countries.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we investigated the ecological and molecular effects of three kinds of stress, namely crowding, predation, and aphid alarm pheromone, on wing dimorphism. These three stressors induced high proportion of up to 60% of winged morphs in offspring. Transcriptome analysis of stress-treated female aphids revealed different changes in maternal gene expression induced by the three stressors. Crowding elicited widespread changes in the expression of genes involved in nutrient accumulation and  mobilization. Distinct from crowding, predation caused dramatic expression changes in cuticle protein (CP) genes. Twenty-three CP genes that belong to CP RR2 subfamily and are highly expressed in legs and embryos were greatly repressed by the presence of ladybird. By contrast, application of alarm pheromone, -β-farnesene, caused slight changes in gene expression. The three factors shared a responsive gene, cuticle protein 43.

Inhibition of this interaction has been explored as a therapeutic avenue for cystic fibrosis. Previously, we reported the ensemble-based computational design of a novel peptide inhibitor of CALP, which resulted in the most binding-efficient inhibitor to date. This inhibitor, kCAL01, was designed using OSPREY and evinced significant biological activity in  cell-based assays. Here, we report a crystal structure of kCAL01 bound to CALP and compare structural features against iCAL36, a previously developed inhibitor of CALP. We compute side-chain  landscapes for each structure to not only enable approximation of binding thermodynamics, but also reveal ensemble features that contribute to the comparatively efficient binding of kCAL01. Finally, we compare the previously reported design ensemble for kCAL01 vs. the new crystal structure and show that, despite small differences between the design model and crystal structure, significant biophysical features that enhance inhibitor binding are captured in the design ensemble. This suggests not only that ensemble-based design captured thermodynamically significant features observed , but also that a design eschewing ensembles would miss the kCAL01 sequence entirely.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697061>Recent Advances in Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) for Carbon Neutral Products and High Value Nanocarbons.</a></h2><p>Climate change represents one of the most important environmental issues of our time. Due to high levels of anthropogenic CO emissions, atmospheric CO has for the first time ever exceeded 415 ppm and has increased from 315 ppm in 1950. An annual increase in atmospheric CO of ∼2 ppm is equal to a net increase of ∼15.6 billion tons of CO. The combustion of fossil fuels for electricity and transportation is still the main reason accounting for the CO accumulation. On the top of that, fossil fuels are widely used in our modern industry for the productions of indispensable social staples. For instance, the millennia old thermal reduction of iron ore by charcoal or baked coal (3C + 2FeO → 4Fe + 3CO) continues as the main method for the production of iron. The artificial fertilizer ammonia boosts the global population and is mainly produced from the Haber-Bosch process, in which hydrogen is generated via steam reforming of methane (CH + 2HO → 4H + CO). Sequestration and diminution of CO require the development of a portfolio of technologies on (1) efficient and long-term harvesting of renewable , that is, solar, not only for electricity but also directly as the  force in vital chemical processes, wherever possible, (2) carbon-neutral processes to replace current industrial processes that emit vast amounts of CO, such as iron and ammonia production, and (3) new, low-cost technologies for CO capture and conversion with particular interests in the exploration of CO as the feedstock for fuels or other valuable chemicals and materials. To this end, we conducted some studies on the sustainable synthesis of ammonia and iron with net-zero CO emissions and large-scale CO capture and conversion into fuels and high value nanocarbon products via electrolysis in molten salt(s) with the introduction of the Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP). In STEP, solar UV-visible  is focused on a photovoltaic device that generates the electricity to drive the electrolysis, while concurrently the solar thermal  is focused on a second system to generate heat for the electrolysis cell. The utilization of the full spectrum of sunlight in STEP results in a higher solar  efficiency than other solar conversion processes. STEP has been applied to conduct (1) CO-free ammonia synthesis from nitrogen and water with the aid of nano-FeO in a molten hydroxide electrolyte, (2) CO-free production of iron via electrochemical reduction of iron ore in molten carbonate, (3) CO capture and conversion into nanostructured carbon products as well as fuels in molten or mixed molten electrolytes, and (4) organic electrosynthesis of benzoic acid from benzene without overoxidizing into CO. In this Account, we highlight some recent achievements in these topics and propose that using STEP is a highly efficient strategy for saving  and, consequently, the environment. STEP is an ideal tool that can theoretically be applied to all endothermic reactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697288>Revisiting the positive roles of liquid polysulfides in alkali metal-sulfur electrochemistry: from electrolyte additives to active catholyte.</a></h2><p>Polysulfide dissolution and shuttling in liquid organic electrolytes are considered as the most challenging detrimental effects of an Li-S cell, which is one of the most promising next-generation high--density batteries. Therefore, considerable efforts have been devoted to confining solid sulfur or sulfide so as to avoid the formation and diffusion of dissolved polysulfides. However, the positive roles played by the liquid polysulfides in Li-S electrochemistry should not be overlooked. Polysulfide dissolution can promote the cell kinetics and sulfur utilization; as electrolyte additives, polysulfides can help stabilize the Li metal anode, redistribute the active mass in the cathode and act as extra back-up active sulfur sources. After being applied directly as active catholytes, a novel Li-polysulfide redox flow battery (Li-PS RFB) and an Li-polysulfide battery (Li-PS battery) have been developed. This review revisited these beneficial effects of polysulfides and provided a summary of the recent progress on Li-PS RFB and Li-PS batteries, especially with a more comprehensive emphasis on the latter. Furthermore, dissolved polysulfides applied as active catholytes in Na-S and K-S systems and as catholytes or anolytes in aqueous batteries were also briefly discussed. Hopefully, the Li-S electrochemistry can be better understood so as to overcome challenging issues in the way of the practical commercialization of the Li-S batteries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697114>Anger as a trigger for information search in integrative negotiations.</a></h2><p>Research has shown that anger can be both detrimental in negotiations (increasing the chance of impasse or conflict) and helpful to the angry person (by eliciting concessions from the other party). Much of this work has focused on a receiver's emotional response to anger. Yet little work has examined the influence of anger on information search, an important cognitive mechanism for joint value creation in integrative negotiations. We propose a cognitive approach: that negotiators facing an angry partner are more likely to seek out diagnostic information about their partner's preferences and priorities. In turn, this information should enable negotiators to reach higher joint gains. Across multiple studies, we find that negotiators facing an angry versus a happy counterpart seek out more information, which leads to increased value creation. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.

For 614 of these both the IE and PA are known; this enables a study of the relationships between these quantities for a wide variety of molecules. From the IE and PA values, the hydrogen atom affinities (HA) of molecular ions, M may also be assessed. The PA may be equated to the heterolytic bond  of [MH] and HA to the homolytic bond . Plots of PA versus IE for these substances show (in agreement with earlier studies) that for many families of molecules the slope of the ensuing line is less negative than -1, i.e. changes in the PA are significantly less than the concomitant opposite changes in IE. At one extreme (high PA, low IE) are the metals, their oxides and hydroxides, which show a slope of close to -1, at the other extreme (low PA, high IE) are the hydrogen halides, methyl halides, and noble gases, which show a slope of ca. -0.3; other molecular categories show intermediate behaviour. One consequence of a slope less negative than -1 is that the changes in ionic enthalpies of the protonated species more closely follow the changes in the enthalpies of the neutral molecules, compared to changes in the ion enthalpies of the corresponding radical cations. This is consistent with findings from ab initio calculations from the literature, that the incoming proton, once attached to the molecule, may retain a significant amount of its charge. These collected data allow a comparison of the thermodynamic stability of protonated molecules in terms of their homolytic or heterolytic bond cleavages. Protonated nitriles are particularly stable by virtue of the very large hydrogen atom affinities of their radical cations.This article is protected by copyright.

It is desirable but remains challenging to develop CNF electrode materials with a large specific surface area (SSA), high specific capacitance (SC) and high power density, as well as excellent cycling stability and high reliability. In this study, we synthesize the acrylonitrile-acrylic acid copolymer P(AN- co -AA) for the preparation of nitrogen-doped microporous CNFs. The thermal degradation of the AA segment leads to the formation of micropores that are distributed not only on the CNF surface but also inside the material. The microporous structure and nitrogen content can be manipulated at the molecular level by adjusting the weight ratio between the AN and AA, and the SSA and SC could reach as high as 1099 m 2 g -1 and 156 F g -1 , respectively. After KOH activation, the Activated Carbon nanofiber (ACNF) possesses an extremely high SSA of 2117 m 2 g -1 and SC of 320 F g -1 , which are almost the highest values ever reported for electric double layer supercapacitors with an alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, the capacitance retention can be maintained at 99% even after 16,000 cyclic tests, exhibiting outstanding durability and repeatability.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The characteristics of the catalyst were studied using field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET),  dispersive X-ray/mapping (EDX/Map), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The result showed that the specific surface area and the average pore diameter of the nanocatalyst were 40.44 m/g and 36.7 nm, respectively, which showed that the catalyst is mesoporous. According to the results of the DLS analysis, the average particle size of the catalyst was determined to be 5.5 nm. Also, the maximum biodiesel yield of 93.12% was obtained at temperature of 70 °C, methanol/oil molar ratio of 12:1, the catalyst content of 1 wt.%, and reaction time of 3 h. In addition, biodiesel was mixed with diesel at different ratios (B25, B50, B75, and B100) to improve fuel properties of the produced biodiesel. The results indicated that the mixtures of B75 and B100 had better density, viscosity, and flash point in comparison to the other mixtures and their properties were within the range of international standards.© King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695111>Effects of suspended micro- and nanoscale particles on zooplankton functional diversity of drainage system reservoirs at an open-pit mine.</a></h2><p>Water from mining drainage is turbid because of suspensions. We tested the hypothesis that the chemical composition as well as shape and size of particles in suspensions of natural origin affect the density and functional diversity of zooplankton. The suspensions were analyzed with atomic force microscopy (AFM),  dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and optical microscopy. Elements found in the beidellite clays were also identified in the mineral structure of the particles. As the size of the microparticles decreased, the weight proportions of phosphorus, sulfur, and chlorine increased in the suspensions. These conditions facilitated the biomass growth of large and small microphages and raptorials. As the size of the nanoparticles decreased, the shares of silicon, aluminum, iron, and magnesium increased. These conditions inhibited raptorials the most. Ecosystem functionality was the highest with intermediate suspension parameters, which were at the lower range of the microphase and the upper range of the nanophase. The functional traits of zooplankton demonstrate their potential for use as sensitive indicators of disruptions in aquatic ecosystems that are linked with the presence of suspensions, and they facilitate gaining an understanding of the causes and scales of the impact of suspensions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697060>Novel Disassembly Mechanisms of Sigmoid Aβ42 Protofibrils by Introduced Neutral and Charged Drug Molecules.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by fibrillar deposits of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and neurofibrillary tangles of Tau proteins. Aβ peptides are composed of 37 to 49 residues, in which the Aβ42 isoform is particularly toxic and aggregation-prone and is enriched in the plaques of AD brains and thus considered central to the development of AD. Therefore, disaggregation and disruption provide potential therapeutic approaches to reduce, inhibit, and even reverse Aβ aggregation. Here we capture the atomic-level details of the interactions between sigmoid Aβ42 fibril 2MXU/5KK3 and either natural tanshinone compounds TS1/TS0 or negative charged ER, proposing two unprecedented disassembly mechanisms. Natural TS1/TS0 prefers to insert into the cavity together with part at the surface of the 2MXU to open up the mouth and twist the conformation, destroying the ordered growth of subsequent monomers along the fibril axis. For the more compact two-fold 5KK3, attachment of TS1/TS0 at the surface including some inserted in cavity results in the separation of the two folds. In the two sigmoid fibril systems, it is no longer applicable for the routine criterions to assess Aβ42 fibril disassembly by introduction of these drugs, such as either reduced H-bond number, decreased β-sheet contents or both. ER, like-charged to Aβ42 fibril, is especially exceptional, and departs utterly from the neutral ones to disassemble Aβ42 fibril. Besides of the inapplicable routine criterions, positive binding  between ER and Aβ42 fibril also deviates from the hypotheses of "ligands exhibiting greater affinity for the β-amyloid peptide are effective at altering its aggregation and inhibiting cell toxicity" (Cairo et al, Biochemistry 2002, 41, 8620 8629), but resulting in stronger disassembly effect on the two kinds of sigmoid Aβ42 fibrils than neutral TS0/TS1. The disassembly power of charged ER molecules derives from its stronger deformation ability to the conformation of Aβ42 fibril than the neutral ones, twisting the one-fold 2MXU in tapered-shape and separating two-fold 5KK3 in two parts more further, that is in great agreement with experimental observations (Irwin, et al. Biomacromolecules 2013, 14 (1), 264-274). The unusual disassembly mechanisms fill the gaps and offer an alternative direction in engineering new inhibitors to treat AD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694917>The human milk protein-lipid complex HAMLET disrupts glycolysis and induces death in .</a></h2><p>HAMLET is a complex of human a-lactalbumin (ALA) and oleic acid and kills several Gram-positive bacteria by a mechanism that bears resemblance to apoptosis in eukaryotic cells. To identify HAMLET's bacterial targets, here we used Streptococcus pneumoniae as a model organism and employed a proteomic approach that identified several potential candidates. Two of these targets were the glycolytic enzymes fructose bis-phosphate aldolase (FBPA) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Treatment of pneumococci with HAMLET immediately inhibited their ATP and lactate production, suggesting that HAMLET inhibits glycolysis. This observation was supported by experiments with recombinant bacterial enzymes, along with biochemical and bacterial viability assays, indicating that HAMLET's activity is partially inhibited by high glucose-mediated stimulation of glycolysis but enhanced in the presence of the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose. Both HAMLET and ALA bound directly to each glycolytic enzyme in solution and solid phase assays and effectively inhibited their enzymatic activities. In contrast, oleic acid alone had little to no inhibitory activity. However, ALA alone also exhibited no bactericidal activity and did not block glycolysis in whole cells, suggesting a role for the lipid moiety in the internalization of HAMLET into the bacterial cells to reach its target(s). This was verified by inhibition of enzyme activity in whole cells after HAMLET but not ALA exposure. The results of this study suggest that part of HAMLET's antibacterial activity relates to its ability to target and inhibit glycolytic enzymes, providing an example of a natural antimicrobial agent that specifically targets glycolysis.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694730>Between- and within-herd variation in blood and milk biomarkers in Holstein cows in early lactation.</a></h2><p>Both blood- and milk-based biomarkers have been analysed for decades in research settings, although often only in one herd, and without focus on the variation in the biomarkers that are specifically related to herd or diet. Biomarkers can be used to detect physiological imbalance and disease risk and may have a role in precision livestock farming (PLF). For use in PLF, it is important to quantify normal variation in specific biomarkers and the source of this variation. The objective of this study was to estimate the between- and within-herd variation in a number of blood metabolites (β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), non-esterified fatty acids, glucose and serum IGF-1), milk metabolites (free glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, urea, isocitrate, BHB and uric acid), milk enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase)) and composite indicators for metabolic imbalances (Physiological Imbalance-index and  balance), to help facilitate their adoption within PLF. Blood and milk were sampled from 234 Holstein dairy cows from 6 experimental herds, each in a different European country, and offered a total of 10 different diets. Blood was sampled on 2 occasions at approximately 14 days-in-milk (DIM) and 35 DIM. Milk samples were collected twice weekly (in total 2750 samples) from DIM 1 to 50. Multilevel random regression models were used to estimate the variance components and to calculate the intraclass correlations (ICCs). The ICCs for the milk metabolites, when adjusted for parity and DIM at sampling, demonstrated that between 12% (glucose-6-phosphate) and 46% (urea) of the variation in the metabolites' levels could be associated with the herd-diet combination. Intraclass Correlations related to the herd-diet combination were generally higher for blood metabolites, from 17% (cholesterol) to approximately 46% (BHB and urea). The high ICCs for urea suggest that this biomarker can be used for monitoring on herd level. The low variance within cow for NAGase indicates that few samples would be needed to describe the status and potentially a general reference value could be used. The low ICC for most of the biomarkers and larger within cow variation emphasises that multiple samples would be needed - most likely on the individual cows - for making the biomarkers useful for monitoring. The majority of biomarkers were influenced by parity and DIM which indicate that these should be accounted for if the biomarker should be used for monitoring.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696641>Rational design of Ag-based catalysts for the electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO: a review.</a></h2><p>The selective electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) to CO in aqueous electrolytes has gained significant interest in recent years due to its capability to mitigate the environmental issues associated with CO2 emission and to convert renewable  such as wind and solar power into chemical  as well as its potential to realize the commercial use of CO2. In view of the thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness of CO2 molecule, the exploitation of active, selective, and stable catalysts for the ECR to CO is crucial to promote the reaction efficiency. Indeed, plenty of electrocatalysts for the selective ECR to CO have been explored, of which Ag is known as the most promising electrocatalyst for large-scale ECR to CO due to several competitive advantages including relatively higher catalytic performance, lower price, and richer reserves compared with other metal counterparts. To provide useful guidelines for the further development of efficient catalysts for the ECR to CO, a comprehensive summary of the recent progress of Ag-based electrocatalysts is presented in this review. Different modification strategies of Ag-based electrocatalysts are highlighted, including exposure of crystal facets, tuning of morphology and size, introduction of support materials, alloying with other metals, and surface modification with functional groups. The reaction mechanisms involved in these different modification strategies of Ag-based electrocatalysts are also discussed. Finally, the prospects for the development of next-generation Ag-based electrocatalysts are proposed in an effort to facilitate the industrialization of ECR to CO.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Bubble breakup is examined in each level of bifurcation and the transition of breakup regimes is discussed in particular. The pressure variations at the center of different levels of bifurcations are analyzed in an effort to gain further insight into the underlying mechanism of bubble breakup affected by multi-levels of bifurcations in tree-shaped microchannel. The results indicate that due to the structure of the fractal tree-shaped microchannel, both lengths of bubbles and local capillary numbers decrease along the microchannel under a constant inlet capillary number. Hence the transition from the obstructed breakup and obstructed-tunnel combined breakup to coalescence breakup is observed when the bubbles are flowing into a higher level of bifurcations. Compared with the breakup of the bubbles in the higher level of bifurcations, the behaviors of bubbles show stronger periodicity in the lower level of bifurcations. Perturbations grow and magnify along the flow direction and the flow field becomes more chaotic at higher level of bifurcations. Besides, the feedback from the unequal downstream pressure to the upstream lower level of bifurcations affects the bubble breakup and enhances the upstream asymmetrical behaviors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694321>Effect of Heat Stress on Bacterial Composition and Metabolism in the Rumen of Lactating Dairy Cows.</a></h2><p>Heat stress negatively impacts the health and milk production of dairy cows, and ruminal microbial populations play an important role in dairy cattle's milk production. Currently there are no available studies that investigate heat stress-associated changes in the rumen microbiome of lactating dairy cattle. Improved understanding of the link between heat stress and the ruminal microbiome may be beneficial in developing strategies for relieving the influence of heat stress on ruminants by manipulating ruminal microbial composition. In this study, we investigated the ruminal bacterial composition and metabolites in heat stressed and non-heat stressed dairy cows. Eighteen lactating dairy cows were divided into two treatment groups, one with heat stress and one without heat stress. Dry matter intake was measured and rumen fluid from all cows in both groups was collected. The bacterial 16S rRNA genes in the ruminal fluid were sequenced, and the rumen pH and the lactate and acetate of the bacterial metabolites were quantified. Heat stress was associated with significantly decreased dry matter intake and milk production. Rumen pH and rumen acetate concentrations were significantly decreased in the heat stressed group, while ruminal lactate concentration increased. The influence of heat stress on the microbial bacterial community structure was minor. However, heat stress was associated with an increase in lactate producing bacteria (e.g.,  and unclassified ), and with an increase in , , and unclassified , all of which utilize soluble carbohydrates as an  source. The relative abundance of acetate-producing bacterium  decreased during heat stress. We concluded that heat stress is associated with changes in ruminal bacterial composition and metabolites, with more lactate and less acetate-producing species in the population, which potentially negatively affects milk production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693466>Comparison of State Transitions of the Photosynthetic Antennae in Arabidopsis and Barley Plants upon Illumination with Light of Various Intensity.</a></h2><p>Changes in the light  distribution between the photosystems 1 and 2 (PS1 and PS2, respectively) due to the reversible migration of a part of the light-harvesting complex (LHC2) between the photosystems (state transitions, ST) have been studied in leaves of barley (Hordeum vulgare) and Arabidopsis thaliana plants upon short-term illumination with light of various intensity that excited predominantly PS2. Changes in the ratio of fluorescence maxima at 745 and 685 nm in the low-temperature (77 K) fluorescence spectrum of chlorophyll a (Chl a) characterizing  absorption by the PS1 and PS2, respectively, were insufficient for revealing the differences in the STs in barley and Arabidopsis plants at various light intensities, because they were not associated with STs at high-intensity illumination. Light-induced accumulation of the LHC2 phosphorylated proteins Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 involved in the relocation of a part of the LHC2 from PS2 to PS1 in the leaves of both plants decreased with the increase in the light intensity and was more pronounced in barley than in Arabidopsis at the same light intensity. Relaxation of the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of Chl a fluorescence after illumination corresponding to the return of the part of LHC2 from PS1 to PS2 was observed in barley leaves in a wider range of increasing light intensities than in Arabidopsis leaves. The differences in the accumulation of phosphorylated Lhcb1 and Lhcb2, as well as in the parameters of NPQ relaxation after illumination, revealed that STs in barley leaves could occur not only at low-but also at high-intensity light, when it is absent in Arabidopsis leaves.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697416>Thermodynamic Analysis of the Uptake of a Protein in a Spherical Polyelectrolyte Brush.</a></h2><p>A thermodynamic study of the adsorption of Human Serum Albumin (HSA) onto spherical polyelectrolyte brushes (SPBs) by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is presented. The SPBs are composed of a solid polystyrene core bearing long chains of poly(acrylic acid). ITC measurements done at different temperatures and ionic strengths lead to a full set of thermodynamicbinding constants together with the enthalpies and entropies of binding. The adsorption of HSA onto SPBs is described with a two-step model. The free  of binding ΔGb depends only weakly on temperature because of a marked compensation of enthalpy by entropy. Studies of the adsorbed HSA by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) demonstrate no significant disturbance in the secondary structure of the protein. The quantitative analysis demonstrates that counterion release is the major driving force for adsorption in a process where proteins become multivalent counterions of the polyelectrolyte chains upon adsorption. A comparison with the analysis of other sets of data related to the binding of HSA to polyelectrolytes demonstrates that the cancellation of enthalpy and entropy is a general phenomenon that always accompanies the binding of proteins to polyelectrolytes dominated by counterion release.© 2019 The Authors.

Herein, a 21-day-long laboratory-scale experiment was designed to explore the growth and physiological responses of Vallisneria natans (Lour.) Hara (V. natans) to the combined effects of manganese (Mn, 5, 20, and 80 mg L) and pH (pH 4.0, 5.5, and 7.0). Our results showed the combined toxicity intensity was closely related to Mn concentration and the toxicity exhibited by Mn gradually strengthened with the decrease of pH level. High concentration of Mn stress significantly reduced plants leaf area, final leaf number, photosynthetic pigment content, RGR (relative growth rate) and biomass accumulation, but significantly increased the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (HO). At the same time, V. natans plants can resist the adverse stress by activating the antioxidant defense system, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities. Besides, V. natans tended to adjust the biomass allocation strategy and transferred more  to the subsurface and the ramets and stolons parts under the combined stress. This experiment also showed that the increasing pH within a certain range could largely improve the removal rate of Mn (at highest by 84.28%). This may indicate the V. natans plant species can act as a promising tool for the Mn phytoremediation in aquatic environments which needs to be further explored by longer cycle field studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694269>Dielectric and  Storage Properties of BaCaZrTiO (BCZT): A Review.</a></h2><p>The BaCaZrTiO (BCZT), a lead-free ceramic material, has attracted the scientific community since 2009 due to its large piezoelectric coefficient and resulting high dielectric permittivity.

This study examines the linkages between trade openness, CO emissions, and healthcare expenditures in China using time series data for the period 1990-2017. The study extended a theoretical model by adding healthcare expenditures, CO emissions, and trade openness with some constraints. We used simultaneous equation method for the analysis, and the outcomes suggest that trade is significantly affecting the CO emissions in the country, resulting in an increase of healthcare expenditures. The government needs reforms and trade policy embodied green  consumption in the industrial sector, especially in export sector industries. In addition, carbon tax may be an important tool to reduce CO emissions and it may compensate the healthcare spending in the country.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696454>Nutrition and Athlete Bone Health.</a></h2><p>Athletes should pay more attention to their bone health, whether this relates to their longer-term bone health (e.g. risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis) or their shorter-term risk of bony injuries. Perhaps the easiest way to do this would be to modify their training loads, although this advice rarely seems popular with coaches and athletes for obvious reasons. As such, other possibilities to support the athletes' bone health need to be explored. Given that bone is a nutritionally modified tissue and diet has a significant influence on bone health across the lifespan, diet and nutritional composition seem like obvious candidates for manipulation. The nutritional requirements to support the skeleton during growth and development and during ageing are unlikely to be notably different between athletes and the general population, although there are some considerations of specific relevance, including  availability, low carbohydrate availability, protein intake, vitamin D intake and dermal calcium and sodium losses.  availability is important for optimising bone health in the athlete, although normative  balance targets are highly unrealistic for many athletes. The level of  availability beyond which there is no negative effect for the bone needs to be established. On the balance of the available evidence it would seem unlikely that higher animal protein intakes, in the amounts recommended to athletes, are not harmful to bone health, particularly with adequate calcium intake. Dermal calcium losses might be an important consideration for endurance athletes, particularly during long training sessions or events. In these situations, some consideration should be given to pre-exercise calcium feeding. The avoidance of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency is important for the athlete to protect their bone health. There remains a lack of information relating to the longer-term effects of different dietary and nutritional practices on bone health in athletes, something that needs to be addressed before specific guidance can be provided.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694525>De novo Nanopore read quality improvement using deep learning.</a></h2><p>Long read sequencing technologies such as Oxford Nanopore can greatly decrease the complexity of de novo genome assembly and large structural variation identification. Currently Nanopore reads have high error rates, and the errors often cluster into low-quality segments within the reads. The limited sensitivity of existing read-based error correction methods can cause large-scale mis-assemblies in the assembled genomes, motivating further innovation in this area.Here we developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based method, called MiniScrub, for identification and subsequent "scrubbing" (removal) of low-quality Nanopore read segments to minimize their interference in downstream assembly process. MiniScrub first generates read-to-read overlaps via MiniMap2, then encodes the overlaps into images, and finally builds CNN models to predict low-quality segments. Applying MiniScrub to real world control datasets under several different parameters, we show that it robustly improves read quality, and improves read error correction in the metagenome setting. Compared to raw reads, de novo genome assembly with scrubbed reads produces many fewer mis-assemblies and large indel errors.MiniScrub is able to robustly improve read quality of Oxford Nanopore reads, especially in the metagenome setting, making it useful for downstream applications such as de novo assembly. We propose MiniScrub as a tool for preprocessing Nanopore reads for downstream analyses. MiniScrub is open-source software and is available at https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/jgi-miniscrub .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695363>Facile green biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using  L. outer peel aqueous extract and its antidiabetic, cytotoxicity, antioxidant, and antibacterial activity.</a></h2><p>The synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using food waste materials and their biomedical applications have garnered considerable attention recently.Here, we investigated the synthesis of AgNPs using an aqueous extract of outer peel of  under different lighting conditions using standard procedures and explored their antidiabetic, cytotoxicity, antioxidant, and antibacterial potential.Characterization of AgNPs was done by Ultra Violet (UV-VIS) spectroscopy that showed absorption maxima at 456 nm for the samples exposed to laboratory lighting and at 464 nm for the samples exposed to direct sunlight, by scanning electron microscopy and -dispersive X-ray analysis that showed the surface nature and their elemental composition with a strong peak at 3 keV that corresponded to Ag (61.85 wt%), by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy that predicted the functional groups involved, and by X-ray powder diffraction that showed the structural properties. The average diameter of the synthesized AgNPs was calculated to be in the range of 10-25 nm. AgNPs exhibited promising antidiabetic activity as determined by inhibition of α-glucosidase (95.29% inhibition at 10 µg/mL and IC value of 2.10 µg/mL) and cytotoxicity (IC value 4.0 µg/mL as calculated from the slope equation) against HepG2 cells. Furthermore, they also exhibited moderate antioxidant activity (50.17% reduction of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl at 100 µg/mL) and antibacterial activity against four human pathogenic bacteria (as indicated by 8.70-11.10 mm inhibition zones on agar plates).In conclusion, the results confirm that food waste can be used in the synthesis of AgNPs and that the latter have the potential for applications in various fields including diabetic and cancer treatments as well as in biomedicine for the manufacture of antibacterial coatings in medical devices and instruments.© 2019 Patra et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697548>Sub-Kelvin Stereodynamics of the Ne(^{3}P_{2})+N_{2} Reaction.</a></h2><p>We present an experimental study of the low- stereodynamics of the Ne(^{3}P_{2})+N_{2} reaction. Supersonic expansions of the two reactants are superposed in a merged beam experiment, where individual velocity control of the two beams allows us to reach average relative velocities of zero, yielding minimum collision energies around 60 mK. We combine the merged beam technique with the orientation of the metastable neon atoms and measure the branching between two reaction channels, Penning ionization and associative ionization, as a function of neon orientation and collision , covering the range 0.06-700 K. We find that we lose the ability to orient Ne below ≈100  K due to dynamic reorientation. Associative ionization products Ne-N_{2}^{+} predissociate with a probability of 30%-60% and that associative ionization is entirely due to reactions of the Ω=2 state, where the singly occupied p orbital of the Ne^{*} is oriented along the interatomic axis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695798>Perspectives on Recent Progress in Focused Ultrasound Immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy holds tremendous promise as a strategy for eradicating solid tumors. However, poor T cell infiltration and persistence within most solid tumor microenvironments, as well as mechanisms of adaptive resistance, continue to severely limit the accessibility of most immunotherapies to a broad patient population. This limitation perpetuates the demand for allied therapeutic strategies. Among such strategies is focused ultrasound (FUS), a non-invasive, non-ionizing technique for precisely targeted acoustic  deposition into tissues. FUS has gained remarkable attention over recent years as a modality for elicitation of immune mechanisms in cancer and other pathologies. In 2017, we published a comprehensive review paper detailing existing evidence for immune modulation and therapy with FUS, as well as impending challenges and opportunities of consideration for the field. Over the last two years, a multitude of clinical trials have come online to explore safety, feasibility, and efficacy of FUS for cancers of the brain and periphery - including the first clinical trial to combine FUS with immunotherapy. Moreover, the last two years have seen a surge in FUS immunotherapy presentations at therapeutic ultrasound scientific meetings. Given the burst of activity in this field, we submit that an update on FUS immunotherapy progress is timely. In this review, we offer an updated overview and perspectives on scientific and clinical development in the FUS immunotherapy domain.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694323>Conformation and Aggregation of Human Serum Albumin in the Presence of Green Tea Polyphenol (EGCg) and/or Palmitic Acid.</a></h2><p>Polyphenols such as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) may have roles in preventing some chronic diseases when they are ingested as components of plant-based foods and beverages. Human serum albumin (HSA) is a multi-domain protein that binds various ligands and aids in their transport, distribution, and metabolism in the circulatory system. In the present study, the HSA-EGCg interaction in the absence or presence of fatty acid has been investigated. Förster resonance  transfer (FRET) was used to determine inter- and intra-domain distances in the protein with and without EGCg and palmitic acid (PA). By labeling Cys-34 with 7-(diethyl amino)-4-methylcoumarin 3-maleimide (CPM), the distance between Trp-214 at domain IIA and CPM-Cys-34 at domain IA could be established. A small amount of PA decreased the distance, while a large amount increased the distance up to 5.4 Å. EGCg increased the inter-domain distance in HSA and HSA-PA up to 2.8 and 7.6 Å, respectively. We concluded that PA affects protein conformation more significantly compared to EGCg. Circular dichroism (CD) established that EGCg affects protein secondary structure more significantly than PA. PA had little effect on the α-helix content of HSA, while EGCg decreased the α-helix content in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, EGCg decreased α-helix content in HSA and HSA-PA to the same level. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) data revealed that both PA and EGCg increased HSA aggregation. EGCg increased HSA aggregation more significantly and promoted formation of aggregates that were more heterogenous. Any of these effects could impact the ability of serum albumin to transport and stabilize ligands including EGCg and other polyphenols.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695029>Solar and wind  enhances drought resilience and groundwater sustainability.</a></h2><p>Water scarcity brings tremendous challenges to achieving sustainable development of water resources, food, and  security, as these sectors are often in competition, especially during drought. Overcoming these challenges requires balancing trade-offs between sectors and improving resilience to drought impacts. An under-appreciated factor in managing the water-food- (WFE) nexus is the increased value of solar and wind  (SWE). Here we develop a trade-off frontier framework to quantify the water sustainability value of SWE through a case study in California. We identify development pathways that optimize the economic value of water in competition for  and food production while ensuring sustainable use of groundwater. Our results indicate that in the long term, SWE penetration creates beneficial feedback for the WFE nexus: SWE enhances drought resilience and benefits groundwater sustainability, and in turn, maintaining groundwater at a sustainable level increases the added value of SWE to  and food production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694291>Nutritional Qualities of Commercial Meal Kit Subscription Services in Australia.</a></h2><p>People are cooking at home less often and relying more on food prepared outside of the home, which is often of less nutritional value than home-cooked meals. The foodservice industry has endeavored to address barriers with the introduction of commercial meal kit subscription services (MKSSs). We aimed to assess and compare the nutritional qualities of MKSSs available in Australia. Average nutritional qualities per serve of 12 recipes (from four weekly boxes of three meals serving two people) were analyzed from five MKKSs (Dinnerly, HelloFresh™, MarleySpoon™, Pepper Leaf, Thomas Farms Kitchen). On average, MKSSs provided adequate serves of core foods, particularly of vegetables (2.3 ± 1.6-3.1 ± 1.8 serves per serve).  content ranged between 2891 ± 539 and 3904 kJ ± 890 per serve. All MKKSs were high in fat (39.5 ± 9.5-59.6 ± 11.2% of ) and sodium (723 ± 404-1426 ± 688 mg per serve). All MKSSs met suggested dietary target level of dietary fiber for women, but none for men. If MKSS providers can modify recipes to reduce added salt and fat and increase dietary fiber, they have the potential to provide both men and women with nutritious meals that more closely align with the dietary guidelines for the prevention of chronic disease, especially if meals are used as an alternative to -dense nutrient-poor takeaway and convenience foods.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697001>Low-Bandgap Se-Deficient Antimony Selenide as a Multifunctional Polysulfide Barrier toward High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries.</a></h2><p>The shuttling behavior and sluggish conversion kinetics of the intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) represent the main obstructions to the practical application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, an anion-deficient design of antimony selenide (Sb Se  ) is developed to establish a multifunctional LiPS barrier toward the inhibition of polysulfide shuttling and enhancement of battery performance. The defect chemistry in the as-developed Sb Se  promotes the intrinsic conductivity, strengthens the chemical affinity to LiPSs, and catalyzes the sulfur electrochemical conversion, which are verified by a series of computational and experimental results. Attributed to these unique superiorities, the obtained LiPS barrier efficiently promotes and stabilizes the sulfur electrochemistry, thus enabling excellent Li-S battery performance, e.g., outstanding cyclability over 500 cycles at 1.0 C with a minimum capacity fading rate of 0.027% per cycle, a superb rate capability up to 8.0 C, and a high areal capacity of 7.46 mAh cm under raised sulfur loading. This work offers a defect engineering strategy toward fast and durable sulfur electrochemistry, holding great promise in developing practically viable Li-S batteries as well as enlightening the material design of related  storage and conversion systems.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Adult oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) play an important role in these demyelinating diseases by generating new myelinating oligodendrocytes that may help limit axonal degeneration. Thus, promoting the differentiation of OPCs and functional integration of newly generated oligodendrocytes is a crucial avenue for the next generation of therapies. Evidence to date suggests that the immune system may both positively and negatively impact OPC differentiation and endogenous remyelination in disease. Inflammatory cytokines not only suppress OPC differentiation but may also directly affect other functions of OPCs. Recent studies have demonstrated that OPCs and oligodendrocytes in both human multiple sclerosis lesions and mouse models of demyelination can express an immunogenic transcriptional signature and upregulate antigen presenting genes. In inflammatory demyelinating mouse models OPCs are capable of presenting antigen and activating CD8 + T cells. Here we review the evidence for this new role of oligodendroglia as antigen presenting cells and how these inflammatory OPCs (iOPCs) and inflammatory oligodendrocytes (iOLs) may influence myelin repair and other disease processes.Copyright © 2019.

In this study, 13-93B3 was incorporated into a commercial PMMA (poly(methyl methacrylate)) bone cement, and the conversion of the glass into a precipitate in solution was investigated with scanning electron microscopy,  dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (spectroscopy)-attenuated total reflection, and micro-Raman spectroscopy. Glass particles of 5, 33, and 100 μm diameter were each mixed with the PMMA cement to create 20, 30, and 40% glass-loaded composites. Precipitate formation was found to be a calcium-deficient apatite partially substituted with magnesium ions that resembles native bone material and would ideally encourage bone growth better than stoichiometric hydroxyapatite. Composites of bone cement and 13-93B3 show promise as a means of encouraging bone attachment to the surface of the bone cement.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695560>Ginseng extracts modulate mitochondrial bioenergetics of live cardiomyoblasts: a functional comparison of different extraction solvents.</a></h2><p>The root of , a member of Araliaceae family, has been used as herbal medicine and functional food in Asia for thousands of years. According to Traditional Chinese medicine, ginseng is the most widely used "Qi-invigorating" herbs, which provides tonic and preventive effects by resisting oxidative stress, influencing  metabolism, and improving mitochondrial function. Very few reports have systematically measured cell mitochondrial bioenergetics after ginseng treatment.Here, H9C2 cell line, a rat cardiomyoblast, was treated with ginseng extracts having extracted using solvents of different polarity, i.e., water, 50% ethanol, and 90% ethanol, and subsequently, the oxygen consumption rate in healthy and -butyl hydroperoxide-treated live cultures was determined by Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer.The 90% ethanol extracts of ginseng possessed the strongest antioxidative and tonic activities to mitochondrial respiration and therefore provided the best protective effects to H9C2 cardiomyocytes. By increasing the spare respiratory capacity of stressed H9C2 cells up to three-folds of that of healthy cells, the 90% ethanol extracts of ginseng greatly improved the tolerance of myocardial cells to oxidative damage.These results demonstrated that the low polarity extracts of ginseng could be the best extract, as compared with others, in regulating the oxygen consumption rate of cultured cardiomyocytes during mitochondrial respiration.© 2018 The Korean Society of Ginseng, Published by Elsevier Korea LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695789>Yin Yang 1 facilitates hepatocellular carcinoma cell lipid metabolism and tumor progression by inhibiting PGC-1β-induced fatty acid oxidation.</a></h2><p>Lipid accumulation is a driving force in tumor development, as it provides tumor cells with both  and the building blocks of phospholipids for construction of cell membranes. Aberrant homeostasis of lipid metabolism has been observed in various tumors; however, the molecular mechanism has not been fully elucidated.  Yin yang 1 (YY1) expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was analyzed using clinical specimens, and its roles in HCC in lipid metabolism were examined using gain- and loss-of function experiments. The mechanism of YY1 regulation on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1β (PGC-1β) and its downstream genes medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) were investigated using molecular biology and biochemical methods. The role of YY1/ PGC-1β axis in hepatocarcinogenesis was studied using xenograft experiment.  This study showed that YY1 suppresses fatty acid β-oxidation, leading to increase of cellular triglyceride level and lipid accumulation in HCC cells, and subsequently induction of the tumorigenesis potential of HCC cells. Molecular mechanistic study revealed that YY1 blocks the expression of , an activator of fatty acid β-oxidation, by directly binding to its promoter; and thus downregulates PGC-1β/MCAD and PGC1-β/LCAD axis. Importantly, we revealed that YY1 inhibition on  occurs irrespective of the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1-α), enabling it to promote lipid accumulation under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions.  Our study reveals the critical role of YY1/PGC-1β axis in HCC cell lipid metabolism, providing novel insight into the molecular mechanisms associated with tumor cell lipid metabolism, and a new perspective regarding the function of YY1 in tumor progression.

In order to increase the durability of transparent exterior coatings, it is possible to use the surface modification of wood with UV-stabilizing substances. In this work, selected types of surface modifications using benzotriazoles, HALS, ZnO and TiO nanoparticles, and their combinations were applied to oak wood (, L.). On such modified surfaces, the surface free , roughness, and contact wetting angle with three selected types of exterior transparent coatings were subsequently determined. An oil-based coating, waterborne acrylic thick layer coating, and thin-layer synthetic coating were tested and interaction with the aforementioned surface modifications was investigated after 6 weeks of accelerated artificial weathering. The results of changes in the initially measured surface characteristics of the modified oak wood were compared to the real results of degradation of coatings after artificial accelerated weathering. The positive effect of surface modification, in particular the mixture of benzotriazoles, HALS, and ZnO nanoparticles on all kinds of coatings was proven, and the best results were observed in thick-film waterborne acrylic coating. The changes in the measured surface characteristics corresponded to the observed durability of the coatings only when measured by wetting using drops of the tested coatings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693448>Insulin suppresses transcriptional activity of YAP in insulin target cells.</a></h2><p>Yes-associated protein (YAP), the main transcriptional coactivator of the Hippo pathway, integrates multiple inputs from different signaling cascades. Evidence implicates YAP in the control of cellular nutrient and  status, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Here we show that insulin modulates YAP transcriptional activity in classic insulin target cells, namely HepG2 and C2C12. Insulin increases YAP phosphorylation and significantly decreases YAP abundance in HepG2 cell nuclei. Proximity ligation assay analysis revealed a marked reduction in the interaction of YAP with TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factors in the nuclei of insulin-exposed cells. Consistent with these findings, insulin impaired both YAP/TEAD-mediated transcription and transcription of YAP target genes in HepG2 and C2C12 cells. Serum starvation abrogated the effect of insulin on YAP phosphorylation and YAP transcription. Both the expression of two gluconeogenesis genes, G6PC and PCK1, and the inhibitory effect of insulin on these genes was attenuated in YAP-deficient HepG2 cells. Our results identify insulin as a previously undescribed suppressor of YAP activity in insulin target cells and provide insight into cross talk between the insulin and Hippo pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694051>Demonstration of a relationship between state transitions and photosynthetic efficiency in a higher plant.</a></h2><p>A consequence of the series configuration of PSI and PSII is that imbalanced excitation of the photosystems leads to a reduction in linear electron transport and a drop in photosynthetic efficiency. Achieving balanced excitation is complicated by the distinct nature of the photosystems, which differ in composition, absorption spectra, and intrinsic efficiency, and by a spectrally variable natural environment. The existence of long- and short-term mechanisms which tune the photosynthetic apparatus and redistribute excitation  between the photosystems highlights the importance of maintaining balanced excitation. In the short term, state transitions help restore balance through adjustments which, though not fully characterised, are observable using fluorescence techniques. Upon initiation of a state transition in algae and cyanobacteria, increases in photosynthetic efficiency are observable. However, while higher plants show fluorescence signatures associated with state transitions, no correlation between a state transition and photosynthetic efficiency has been demonstrated. In the present study, state 1 and state 2 were alternately induced in tomato leaves by illuminating leaves produced under artificial sun and shade spectra with a sequence of irradiances extreme in terms of PSI or PSII overexcitation. Light-use efficiency increased in both leaf types during transition from one state to the other with remarkably similar kinetics to that of F'm/Fm, F'o/Fo, and, during the PSII-overexciting irradiance, ΦPSII and qP. We have provided compelling evidence for the first time of a correlation between photosynthetic efficiency and state transitions in a higher plant. The importance of this relationship in natural ecophysiological contexts remains to be elucidated.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695818>Management of paediatric humeral shaft fractures and associated nerve palsy.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study is to review the management of all paediatric humerus diaphyseal fractures treated at a single institution over a 20-year period.Retrospective review from between 1996 and 2016 identified 96 humerus shaft fractures in paediatric patients (0 to 17 years). After excluding those deceased from inciting trauma, pathological and perinatal fractures, 80 patients remained for analysis. Data collected included age, fracture type, displacement, nerve palsy, treatment, complications and time to union. Radiographs were reviewed at the time of injury and at latest follow-up.Of 80 paediatric humeral diaphyseal fractures, 65 (81%) were treated with immobilization. In all, 15 (19%) fractures were treated with surgical stabilization. Most common indications were fracture displacement, open fractures and to improve mobilization in patients with multiple injuries. Fractures were stabilized with a plate (eight), flexible nails (five), external fixation (one) and percutaneous pinning (one). The operative group, compared with the nonoperative group, was older, had more high- mechanisms, more open fractures and increased fracture displacement. All patients in the nonoperative and operative groups went on to union with minimal complications. A nerve palsy was present in five patients (6%)with three of the five involving the radial nerve (4%). All nerve palsies were observed and had full neurological recovery.Over a 20-year period nonoperative management of paediatric humerus shaft fractures was successful in the majority of patients. Operative stabilization, when rarely indicated, had a low complication rate and improved radiographic alignment.

Modified Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory can handle conflicting sensor inputs and can be applied without any prior information. As a result, DS-based information fusion is very popular in decision-making applications, but original DS theory produces counterintuitive results when combining highly conflicting evidences from multiple sensors. An effective algorithm offering fusion of highly conflicting information in spatial domain is not widely reported in the literature. In this paper, a successful fusion algorithm is proposed which addresses these limitations of the original Dempster-Shafer (DS) framework. A novel entropy function is proposed based on Shannon entropy, which is better at capturing uncertainties compared to Shannon and Deng entropy. An 8-step algorithm has been developed which can eliminate the inherent paradoxes of classical DS theory. Multiple examples are presented to show that the proposed method is effective in handling conflicting information in spatial domain.

Applications range from simple biomass production for food and animal feed to valuable products for fuel, pharmaceuticals, health, biomolecules and materials relevant to nanotechnology. There are few reports of the exploration of wider microalgae biodiversity in the literature on high value microalgal compounds, however, because it is believed that there is little to be gained in terms of biomass productivity by examining new strains. Still, without diversity, innovation in biotechnology applications is currently limited. Using microalgal diversity is a very promising way to match species and processes for a specific biotechnological application. In this context, three benthic marine diatom strains (Entomoneis paludosa NCC18.2, Nitzschia alexandrina NCC33, and Staurosira sp NCC182) were selected for their lipid production and growth capacities. Using PAM fluorometry and FTIR spectroscopy, this study investigated the impact of nitrogen repletion and depletion as well as light intensity (30, 100, and 400 μmol.photons.m-2.s-1) on their growth, photosynthetic performance and macromolecular content, with the aim of improving the quality of their lipid composition. Results suggest that under high light and nitrogen limitation, the photosynthetic machinery is negatively impacted, leading cells to reduce their growth and accumulate lipids and/or carbohydrates. However, increasing lipid content under stressful conditions does not increase the production of lipids of interest: PUFA, ARA and EPA production decreases. Culture conditions to optimize production of such fatty acids in these three original strains led to a balance between economic and ecophysiological constraints: low light and no nitrogen limitation led to better photosynthetic capacities associated with  savings, and hence a more profitable approach.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696283>Characterization of cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase from Tribolium castaneum and its application in the production of β-alanine.</a></h2><p>β-alanine is a precursor for the production of pharmaceuticals and food additives that is produced by chemical methods in industry. As concerns about the environment and  are increasing, biocatalysis using L-aspartate-α-decarboxylase (ADC) to convert L-aspartate to β-alanine has great potential. Many studies have focused on the catalytic activity of ADC, but these researches were limited to the prokaryotic enzymes. In this study, the gene encoding cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase from Tribolium castaneum (TcCSADC) was synthesized and overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the enzyme was purified and characterized for the first time. It could use L-aspartate as its substrate, and the specific activity was 4.83 μmol/min/mg, which was much higher than that of ADCs from prokaryotes. A homology modeling assay indicated that TcCSADC had a dimer structure. Based on the evolutionary information from thermophilic bacteria, twenty-three variants were constructed to attempt to improve its abilities that transform L-aspartate to β-alanine. One mutant, G369A, was screened that had improved thermal stability. An analysis of the suitability of the catalytic process showed that the up to 162 g/L β-alanine could be produced using cells expressing the recombinant G369A variant, which is the highest yield to date.

The surfaces were cleaned and the teeth were randomly divided into nine groups ( = 5 each) to evaluate the effects of Er:YAG laser treatment at different  levels: 200 mJ, 2 Hz; 200 mJ, 3 Hz; 200 mJ, 10 Hz; 250 mJ, 2 Hz; 250 mJ, 3 Hz; 250 mJ, 10 Hz; 300 mJ, 2 Hz; 300 mJ, 3 Hz; and 300 mJ, 10 Hz. The mean percentage weight (wt%) of calcium (Ca), phosphorous (P), fluoride (F), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), and sodium (Na) in the primary tooth enamel was calculated for each group using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with  dispersive X-ray spectroscopy before and after laser application. The enamel morphology was also evaluated using SEM. The obtained data were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's honest significant difference test.  The mean wt% of Ca, P, and F in the enamel exhibited a significant change after laser treatment ( < 0.05); the wt% of Mg, K, and Na remained unchanged ( > 0.05). There was no association between the power setting of the laser and changes in the wt% of minerals in the enamel ( > 0.05). SEM showed that enamel irradiated at different  levels exhibited a characteristic lava flow appearance, and more surface irregularities were observed with the 250-mJ setting than with the 200-mJ setting.  Our findings suggest that the mineral content and morphology of the enamel of primary teeth are affected by Er:YAG laser irradiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698522>SGLT1 Inhibition Boon or Bane for Diabetes Associated Cardiomyopathy.</a></h2><p>Chronic hyperglycaemia is a peculiar feature of diabetes mellitus (DM). Sequential metabolic abnormalities accompanying glucotoxicity are some of its implications. Glucotoxicity most likely corresponds to the vascular intricacy and metabolic alterations, such as increased oxidation of free fatty acids and reduced glucose oxidation. More than half of those with diabetes also develop cardiac abnormalities due to unknown causes, posing a major threat to the currently available marketed preparations which are being used for treating these cardiac complications. Even though impairment in cardiac functioning is the principal cause of death in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), reducing plasma glucose levels has little effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that inhibitors of sodium glucose transporter (SGLT) represent a putative therapeutic intervention for these pathological conditions. Several clinical trials have reported the efficacy of SGLT inhibitors as a novel and potent anti-diabetic agent which along with its anti-hyperglycaemic activity possesses the potential of effectively treating its associated cardiac abnormalities. Thus, hereby, the present review highlights the role of SGLT inhibitors as a successful drug candidate for correcting the shifts in deregulation of cardiac  substrate metabolism together with its role in treating diabetes related cardiac perturbations.© 2019 Société Française de Pharmacologie et de Thérapeutique.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696719>Asymmetric Synthesis of 1-Benzazepine Derivatives via Copper-Catalyzed Intramolecular Reductive Cyclization.</a></h2><p>An asymmetric construction of enantioenriched 2,3-substituted-1-benzazepine derivatives containing a cyclic tertiary amine moiety was developed by copper-catalyzed reductive intramolecular cyclization of ()-dienyl arenes with a tethered ketimine.

The adequate amount of EI for improving performance of ADL in patients with hip fracture remains unknown.This retrospective cohort study included all patients with hip fracture (n=234) admitted to rehabilitation hospitals in Japan. The inclusion criteria for this study were age >65 years and body mass index <30.0 kg/m2. Patients who were transferred to an acute hospital and those with missing case data were excluded. According to the amount of EI, the patients were classified into  sufficiency and shortage groups (EI/total  expenditure ≥1.0 and <1.0, respectively). The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and FIM gain were used to evaluate the patient disability level and change in patient status in response to rehabilitation. Finally, FIM gain was calculated as the discharge FIM score minus the admission FIM score.The final analysis targeted 202 patients-53 (26.2%) were in the  shortage group and 149 (73.8%) were in the  sufficiency group. The  sufficiency group had a greater FIM gain than the  shortage group (mean, 25.1±14.2 vs. 19.7±16.4; p=0.024). Furthermore, sufficient EI in the first week since admission (β=0.165; 95% confidence interval, 0.392-5.230; p=0.023) was an independent factor of FIM gain.Among elderly patients with hip fracture admitted to rehabilitation hospitals in Japan, the amount of EI during the first week after admission was an independent factor of FIM gain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696889>Size induced structural changes in maricite-NaFePO: an in-depth study by experiment and simulations.</a></h2><p>Rechargeable batteries based on the most abundant elements, such as sodium and iron, have a great potential in the development of cost effective sodium ion batteries for large scale  storage devices. We report, for the first time, crystallite size dependent structural investigations on maricite-NaFePO4 through X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical simulations. Rietveld refinement analysis on the X-ray diffraction data reveals that a decrease in the unit cell parameters leads to volume contraction upon reduction in the crystallite size. Further, the atomic multiplet simulations on X-ray absorption spectra provide unequivocally a change in the site symmetry of transition metal ions. The high resolution oxygen K-edge spectra reveal a substantial change in the bonding character with the reduction of crystallite size, which is the fundamental cause for the change in the unit cell parameters of maricite-NaFePO4. In parallel, we performed first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations on maricite-NaFePO4 with different sodium ion vacancy concentrations. The obtained structural parameters are in excellent agreement with the experimental observations on the mesostructured maricite-NaFePO4. The volumetric changes with respect to crystallite size are related to the compressive strain, resulting in the improvement in the electronic diffusivity. The nano-crystalline maricite-NaFePO4 with improved kinetics will open a new avenue for its usage as a cathode material in sodium ion batteries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696309>[Catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias : Forms of  and biophysical principles].</a></h2><p>Catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias has evolved over the years and has become a cornerstone in the modern treatment of various supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. The goal of ablation is to permanently damage myocardium that is critically involved in the individual arrhythmia mechanism. Different catheters and forms of  are available. Radiofrequency (RF) ablation is most common. Application of an alternating current at the catheter tip induces heating of tissue and, thus, leads to ablation of a targeted arrhythmogenic substrate. High temperatures (>70 °C at the catheter tip and >95 °C within the tissue) bear the risk of coagulum formation and steam pops and should be avoided, which limits power application. The evolution of irrigated RF ablation catheters enables the transfer of more power to the tissue and thereby increases the dimensions of the lesions. Cryoablation represents a valuable alternative. Cooling of tissue to -80 °C causes the intra- and extracellular formation of ice crystals, finally resulting in a dense circumscribed scar. The cryomapping procedure grants improved surveillance of the safety of ablation. Cryoenergy is very popular for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) using the cryoballoon. In addition to the laser balloon that is established for PVI, ultrasound, microwaves, and stereotactic irradiation complete the arsenal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696321>A novel method for intraoperative osseomechanical strength measurements: a biomechanical ex vivo evaluation on proximal femora.</a></h2><p>The increasing number of geriatric traumatology cases has intensified the need to reliably and objectively evaluate local bone quality, the latter poses a decisive factor for the choice of an optimal approach to treat osteoporotic fractures. Osteodensitometry imaging techniques are not routinely available in acute operative settings, nor do they provide objective information on local bone properties specifically needed for the prognosis of implant stability.This study sought to verify ex vivo the feasibility and sensitivity of a novel method for the determination of local bone strength in the acute operative setting (intraoperative osseomechanical strength measurement; IOSM) that is based on the principle of material displacement resistance against the force of a rotary indenter. Samples consisted of human femoral heads obtained after total hip replacement. Comparisons were made with results obtained via conventional dual- X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and quantitative computed tomography (qCT).Regression analyses of the results showed a highly significant correlation between the IOSM and the control methods (r = 0.61 and r = 0.56; p < 0.01), indicating that this new approach qualifies as a reliable tool for the intraoperative evaluation of the intrinsic local bone strength.The intraoperative integration of this method may support surgeon on taking proper decisions in terms of optimal surgical approaches and prevention of complications inherent to osteoporotic bone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697740>From waste to food: Optimising the breakdown of oil palm waste to provide substrate for insects farmed as animal feed.</a></h2><p>Waste biomass from the palm oil industry is currently burned as a means of disposal and solutions are required to reduce the environmental impact. Whilst some waste biomass can be recycled to provide green  such as biogas, this investigation aimed to optimise experimental conditions for recycling palm waste into substrate for insects, farmed as a sustainable high-protein animal feed. NMR spectroscopy and LC-HRMS were used to analyse the composition of palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) under experimental conditions optimised to produce nutritious substrate rather than biogas. Statistical pattern recognition techniques were used to investigate differences in composition for various combinations of pre-processing and anaerobic digestion (AD) methods. Pre-processing methods included steaming, pressure cooking, composting, microwaving, and breaking down the EFB using ionic liquids. AD conditions which were modified in combination with pre-processing methods were ratios of EFB:digestate and pH. Results show that the selection of pre-processing method affects the breakdown of the palm waste and subsequently the substrate composition and biogas production. Although large-scale insect feeding trials will be required to determine nutritional content, we found that conditions can be optimised to recycle palm waste for the production of substrate for insect rearing. Pre-processing EFB using ionic liquid before AD at pH6 with a 2:1 digestate:EFB ratio were found to be the best combination of experimental conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696310>Monitoring long-term spatial and temporal trends of the infaunal community characteristics along the shallow waters of the Mediterranean coast of Israel.</a></h2><p>Sandy sediment and its infauna were annually sampled along the shallow waters of the Israeli coast during the 2005-2016 period, as a part of the Israeli National Environmental Program framework, aiming to detect anthropogenic interference in that province by monitoring changes in the species composition, abundance, and diversity of the infaunal communities and in accompanied abiotic parameters: the levels of total organic carbon and a series of heavy metals and the site-specific grain size distribution. The > 250-μm fraction of the fauna was segregated from the sampled sediment and was identified to species or higher taxonomic level. Three spatial biotopes were determined based on their unique faunal composition, Haifa Bay, Haifa harbor, and the southern coast. Species homogeneity among samples of each biotope was evaluated. Temporal and spatial changes of the species composition, abundance, and diversity were calculated for each biotope, mostly revealing random annual fluctuations. Only two minor temporal trends were observed: two spatially identical and temporally different faunal communities in the southern coast biotope, distinguishing the 2005-2007 and 2008-2016 periods, and a slight increase in the number of species across time in the two Haifa Bay provinces. Total organic carbon was highly correlated to the faunal composition with the highest organic carbon levels in the Haifa harbor biotope. The biotopes' mutually occurring abundant species were sufficient to determine biotope borders and the contribution of intermittently sampled rare species, including the zoogeographically Indo-Pacific originated ones was feeble, important only to identify species migration and faunistics. Practically, three sampling sites along the Israeli shallow soft substrate, corresponding to the defined spatial biotopes, are sufficient to monitor the effect of environmental changes. Seasonal sampling twice a year is recommended as well as more accurate species identification using molecular taxonomy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694275>Education and Protein Supplementation Improve Nutritional Biomarkers among Hypoalbuminemic Peritoneal Dialysis Patients: A Quasi-Experimental Design.</a></h2><p>Protein- wasting is prevalent in peritoneal dialysis patients, which causes a heavy burden for individuals and healthcare systems. We aimed to investigate the effect of nutritional education, and/or protein supplementation on nutritional biomarkers in hypoalbuminemic peritoneal dialysis patients. A quasi-experimental study was conducted in two dialysis centers at Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital and Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital. Patients were allocated in three groups including control ( = 12), milk protein ( = 21) and soy protein ( = 20). All patients received dietary guidelines from dietitians and completed 3-day dietary records during monthly visits for consecutive three months. Nutrients were analyzed using Nutritionist Professional software. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, albumin, total protein, hemoglobin, serum calcium, phosphorus, sodium, and potassium were assessed monthly. Total cholesterol and triglycerides were measured every three months. After three-month intervention, protein intake (percent of total calories), and serum albumin were significantly increased in three groups. Protein, phosphorus intake, and BUN were increased in two intervention groups. Total serum protein increased in control and milk protein groups, and creatinine increased the control group. Serum phosphorus was not significantly changed.

In this work, we reveal that the globular tail domain of MyoVc binds to the active form of small GTPase Rab3A with nanomolar affinity, a feature shared with MyoVa but not with MyoVb. Using molecular docking analyses guided by chemical cross-linking restraints, we propose a model to explain how Rab3A selectively recognizes MyoVa and MyoVc via a distinct binding site from that used by Rab11A. The MyoVa/c binding interface involves multiple residues from both lobules (I and II) and the short helix at the α2-α3 link region, which is conserved between MyoVa and MyoVc, but not in MyoVb. This motif is also responsible for the selective binding of RILPL2 by MyoVa and potentially MyoVc. Together, these findings support the selective recruitment of MyoVa and MyoVc to exocytic pathways via Rab3A and expand our knowledge about the functional evolution of class V myosins. SIGNIFICANCE: Hormone secretion, neurotransmitter release, and cytoplasm membrane recycling are examples of processes that rely on the interaction of molecular motors and Rab GTPases to regulate the intracellular trafficking and tethering of vesicles. Defects in these proteins may cause neurological impairment, immunodeficiency, and other severe disorders, being fatal in some cases. Despite their crucial roles, little is known about how these molecular motors are selectively recruited by specific members of the large family of Rab GTPases. In this study, we unveil the interaction between the actin-based molecular motor Myosin Vc and the small GTPase Rab3A, a key coordinator of vesicle trafficking and exocytosis in mammalian cells. Moreover, we propose a model for their recognition and demonstrate that Rab3A specifically binds to the globular tail of Myosins Va and Vc, but not of Myosin Vb, advancing our knowledge about the molecular basis for the selective recruitment of class V myosins by Rab GTPases.Copyright © 2018.

AL was defined as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV)/forced vital capacity (FVC) of <0.7. Reversibility tests were not performed in this study. The criteria used for the AL staging were developed according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (GOLD) guidelines. The subjects were divided into the following three groups: a control group (normal pulmonary function), GOLD Stage I group (mild AL), and GOLD Stage II-IV group (moderate-to-very severe AL). BMD was classified based on the young adult mean (YAM) as normal (88.6% ≦ YAM [-1 SD ≦]), osteopenia (70% <YAM <88.6% [<- 1 SD and > -2.5 SD]), or osteoporosis (YAM ≦ 70% [≦ -2.5 SD]). Reduced BMD was defined as osteopenia, osteoporosis, or medication used for osteoporosis. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between AL severity and the reduced BMD.The prevalence of reduced BMD in subjects with moderate-to-severe AL (76.2%) was significantly higher than in those without AL (47.9%) (=0.030). In logistic regression models adjusted for age, body mass index, pack-years, physical activity, and alcohol drinking, the risk of reduced BMD (odds ratio: 3.87; 95% confidence interval: 1.20-12.49; =0.024) was significantly higher in subjects with moderate-to-severe AL than in those with normal pulmonary function.Present results suggest that reduced BMD is associated with AL severity in Japanese men.© 2019 Watanabe et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693877>Natural cryoprotectants combinations of l-proline and trehalose for red blood cells cryopreservation.</a></h2><p>Cryopreservation of red blood cells (RBCs) holds great potential benefits for supplying transfusion timely in emergencies. Currently, glycerol is the main cryoprotectant permitted in clinical therapy for RBCs cryopreservation, but its broad application is limited by the toxicity and complex deglycerolization process. Successful cryopreservation of RBCs using more effective materials should be studied to reduce freezing damage, increase biocompatibility, and save processing time. Herein, a simple protocol using natural cryoprotectants combinations of l-proline and trehalose attains a low degree of hemolysis (11.2 ± 2.73%) after thawing compared to glycerol. Furthermore, the morphology of RBCs and the activities of Na/K-ATPase and Ca/Mg-ATPase maintain well. Further mechanism study shows that l-proline plays an important role in decreasing the freezing points and inhibiting the growth of ice crystal by permeating into cells during the freezing process. While trehalose works as an inhibitor of ice growth in the freezing process and ice recrystallization in the thawing process. This simple l-proline & trehalose combinations protocol is a promising method to replace current time-consuming and labor-intensive cryopreservation methods of RBCs.Copyright © 2019.

However, the current estimation methods have some drawbacks, such as not meeting China's situation, data obsolescence, and relatively high uncertainty. Moreover, there are large differences in estimated results among previous studies. To address these problems, this paper proposes a new provincial-level -related CO emission estimation method refer to methods at different levels in China and abroad. We re-divide the  involved in a province based on  flow and consumption-based responsibility and propose an accounting method for calculating provincial-level CO emission factors, which provides clear cross-provincial emission allocation and accurate provincial-level emission estimation. By taking Shandong Province as an example, we calculate the provincial-level CO emission factors and obtain the CO emissions from 2000 to 2016. Furthermore, the reasons for the large gaps between calculated CO emissions in Shandong are further quantitatively analyzed from the perspective of the method and data selection. The results indicate that although different methods greatly influence the estimation results, the gaps that arise from different selections of calculation scope,  classification, activity data and CO emission factor within a method also require attention.

Compared to the intensively investigated transcriptome and proteome, the metabolic response to heat stress is not sufficiently characterized. Mitochondria have been recognized to play an essential role in heat stress tolerance. Given the compartmentalization of the cell, it is not clear if the heat stress-induced metabolic response occurs in mitochondria or in the cytosol. Therefore, a compartment-specific metabolite analysis was performed to analyze the heat stress-induced metabolic response in mitochondria and the cytoplasm. In this work, the isolated mitochondria and the cytoplasm of yeast cells grown at permissive temperature and cells adapting to heat stress were subjected to mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Over a hundred metabolites could be identified, covering amino acid metabolism,  metabolism, arginine metabolism, purine and pyrimidine metabolism, and others. Highly accumulated citrulline and reduced arginine suggested remodeled arginine metabolism. A stable isotope-labeled experiment was performed to analyze the heat stress-induced metabolic remodeling of the arginine metabolism, identifying activated  ornithine biosynthesis to support arginine and spermidine synthesis.

It is commonly seen as a starvation response when nutrients run out, or as an escape response from harmful situations. Here we identify an alternative role of chemotaxis by systematically examining the spatiotemporal dynamics of Escherichia coli in soft agar. Chemotaxis in nutrient-replete conditions promotes the expansion of bacterial populations into unoccupied territories well before nutrients run out in the current environment. Low levels of chemoattractants act as aroma-like cues in this process, establishing the direction and enhancing the speed of population movement along the self-generated attractant gradients. This process of navigated range expansion spreads faster and yields larger population gains than unguided expansion following the canonical Fisher-Kolmogorov dynamics and is therefore a general strategy to promote population growth in spatially extended, nutrient-replete environments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694289>High Electromechanical Deformation Based on Structural Beta-Phase Content and Electrostrictive Properties of Electrospun Poly(vinylidene fluoride- hexafluoropropylene) Nanofibers.</a></h2><p>The poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) (P(VDF-HFP)) polymer based on electrostrictive polymers is essential in smart materials applications such as actuators, transducers, microelectromechanical systems, storage memory devices,  harvesting, and biomedical sensors. The key factors for increasing the capability of electrostrictive materials are stronger dielectric properties and an increased electroactive β-phase and crystallinity of the material. In this work, the dielectric properties and microstructural β-phase in the P(VDF-HFP) polymer were improved by electrospinning conditions and thermal compression. The P(VDF-HFP) fibers from the single-step electrospinning process had a self-induced orientation and electrical poling which increased both the electroactive β-crystal phase and the spontaneous dipolar orientation simultaneously. Moreover, the P(VDF-HFP) fibers from the combined electrospinning and thermal compression achieved significantly enhanced dielectric properties and microstructural β-phase. Thermal compression clearly induced interfacial polarization by the accumulation of interfacial surface charges among two β-phase regions in the P(VDF-HFP) fibers. The grain boundaries of nanofibers frequently have high interfacial polarization, as they can trap charges migrating in an applied field. This work showed that the combination of electrospinning and thermal compression for electrostrictive P(VDF-HFP) polymers can potentially offer improved electrostriction behavior based on the dielectric permittivity and interfacial surface charge distributions for application in actuator devices, textile sensors, and nanogenerators.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694060>The Origin and Evolution of the HARMONIC® Scalpel.</a></h2><p>When Jacques and Pierre Curie first researched ultrasonic  and piezoelectric effects in the 1880s, they likely had no idea of the profound impact it would eventually have on surgical patients.

To overcome the high- cost of traditional electrochemical oxidation, a custom-built power supply device for the degradation of anthraquinone and azo dyes by low voltage of 15.0-20.0 V pulsed discharge was investigated. Titanium coated with mixed oxide (Ti/IrO -RuO -SnO ) plates and pure titanium plates were used as the anode and cathode, respectively, for the generation of chlorine in the dye solution. For the anthraquione dye Reactive Blue 19, 60.0% of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 22.0% of the total organic carbon (TOC) were removed using this system. A comparison of the direct current electrolysis and pulsed discharge revealed that using the pulsed discharge method reduced the  cost by 68.6%. UV-visible, LC-MS, and GC-MS were used to identify the intermediate compounds formed during the degradation of Reactive Blue 19. The results indicate that in the process of oxidation by chlorine/hypochlorite, the chromophore group was first oxidized to -NH , followed by decolorization via chlorination of the aromatic rings. The results confirm that low-voltage pulse-electrolysis can be used for the degradation of industrial dyes in waste effluents.© 2019 Water Environment Federation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696717>Liquid-crystalline suspensions of photosensitive paramagnetic CeF3 nanodiscs.</a></h2><p>The design of high-performance -converting materials is an essential step for the development of sensors but the elaboration of the bulk materials currently used remains costly and difficult. Therefore, a different approach based on the self-assembly of nanoparticles has been explored. We report on the preparation by solvothermal synthesis of highly crystalline CeF3 nanodiscs. Their surface modification by bisphosphonate ligands led to stable, highly concentrated, colloidal suspensions in water. Despite the low aspect ratio of the nanodiscs (~ 6), a liquid-crystalline nematic phase spontaneously appeared in these colloidal suspensions. Thanks to the paramagnetic character of the nanodiscs, the nematic phase was easily aligned by a weak (0.5 T) magnetic field, which provides a simple and convenient way of orienting all the nanodiscs in suspension in the same direction. Moreover, the more dilute, isotropic, suspensions displayed strong (electric and magnetic) field-induced orientation of the nanodiscs (Kerr and Cotton-Mouton effects), with fast enough response times to make them suitable for use in electro-optic devices. Furthermore, an emission study showed a direct relation between fluorescence intensity and magnetic-field-induced orientation of the colloids. Finally, with their fast radiative recombination decay rates, the nanodiscs show luminescence properties that compare quite favorably with those of bulk CeF3. Therefore, these CeF3 nanodiscs are very promising building blocks for the development and processing of photosensitive materials for sensor applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696703>Mitochondria-targeting peptides and peptidomimetics: recent progress and design principles.</a></h2><p>Mitochondria are multifunctional subcellular organelles whose operations encompass  production, signal transduction, and metabolic regulation. Given their wide range of roles, they have been studied extensively as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of various diseases including cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondria-mediated pathways have been identified as promising targets in the context of these diseases. However, the delivery of specific probes and drugs to the mitochondria remains as one of the major problems yet to be solved. Over the past decade, many efforts have been made to develop mitochondria-targeted delivery methods based on the membrane characteristics and the protein import machinery of mitochondria. While various methods utilizing small molecules to polymeric particles have been introduced, it is notable that many of these compounds share common structural elements and physicochemical properties for optimal selectivity and efficiency. In this perspective, we will overview most recently developed mitochondria-targeting peptides and peptidomimetics to outline the key aspects of structural requirement and design principle. We will also discuss successful and potential applications of mitochondrial delivery to assess opportunities and challenges in mitochondria-targeting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693486>GLP-1 signaling is required for improvement of glucose tolerance by osteocalcin.</a></h2><p>Osteocalcin is a bone-derived hormone that in its uncarboxylated form (GluOC) plays an important role in glucose and  metabolism by stimulating insulin secretion and pancreatic β-cell proliferation through its putative receptor GPRC6A. We previously showed that the effect of GluOC on insulin secretion is mediated predominantly by glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) released from intestinal endocrine cells in response to GluOC stimulation. Moreover, oral administration of GluOC was found to reduce the fasting blood glucose level, to improve glucose tolerance, and to increase the fasting serum insulin concentration and β-cell area in the pancreas in wild-type mice. We have now examined the effects of oral GluOC administration for at least 4 weeks in GLP-1 receptor knockout mice. Such administration of GluOC in the mutant mice triggered glucose intolerance, enhanced gluconeogenesis, and promoted both lipid accumulation in the liver as well as adipocyte hypertrophy and inflammation in adipose tissue. Furthermore, inactivation of GLP-1 receptor signaling in association with GluOC administration induced activation of the transcription factor FoxO1 and expression of its transcriptional coactivator PGC1α in the liver, likely accounting for the observed up-regulation of gluconeogenic gene expression. Our results thus indicate that the beneficial metabolic effects of GluOC are dependent on GLP-1 receptor signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696273>Age-related periosteal expansion at femoral neck among elderly women may maintain bending stiffness, but not femoral strength.</a></h2><p>Periosteal expansion and bone loss have opposite effects on femur strength. Their combined effect has not been fully understood. Our investigation using a recently developed beam model suggested that periosteal expansion may maintain femur bending stiffness among elderly women, but not help preserve femoral strength and reduce hip fracture risk.Periosteal expansion and bone loss are two accompanying biological phenomena in old population. Their combined effect on bone stiffness, strength, and fracture risk is still not clear, because previous studies have reported contradictory results.A recently developed DXA (dual- X-ray absorptiometry)-based beam model was applied to study the effect at the femoral neck. We first made a theoretical analysis. Then, a clinical cohort consisting of 961 women (316 hip fractures and 645 controls, age of 75.9 ± 7.1) was used to investigate the associations quantitatively. We investigated (1) correlations of femoral-neck width and bone mineral density with femoral stiffness and strength; (2) correlations of femoral stiffness, strength, and hip fracture risk index with age; (3) associations of femoral stiffness, strength and fracture risk index with actual fracture status, measured by the area under the curve (AUC) and odds ratio (OR).The investigation results showed that (i) femoral-neck width had stronger correlation with femoral bending stiffness (r = 0.61-0.82, p < 0.001) than with the other stiffness components, while bone mineral density had stronger correlation with axial/shearing stiffness (r = 0.84-0.97, p < 0.001), strength (r = 0.85-0.92, p < 0.001), and fracture risk index (r = -0.61-0.62, p < 0.001) than with bending stiffness. (ii) The association between femoral bending stiffness and age was insignificant (r = - 0.06-0.05, r > 0.05); The associations of axial/shearing stiffness (r = - 0.27--0.20, p < 0.001), strength (r = - 0.28, p < 0.001), and fracture risk index (r = 0.38, p < 0.001) with age were significant. (iii) Fracture risk index had the strongest association with actual fracture status (AUC = 0.75, OR = 3.19), followed by strength (AUC = 0.74, OR = 2.84) and axial/shearing stiffness (AUC = 0.56-0.65, OR = 2.39-2.49). Femoral bending stiffness had the weakest association (AUC = 0.48-0.69, OR = 1.42-2.09).We concluded that periosteal expansion may be adequate to maintain femoral bending stiffness among elderly women, but it may not help preserve strength and reduce hip fracture risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696272>Underestimated fracture risk in postmenopausal women-application of the hybrid intervention threshold.</a></h2><p>This study evaluated the fragility fracture risk of Taiwanese postmenopausal women with osteopenia. With the incorporation of FRAX and hybrid intervention threshold (HIT), 25% of the participants had high fracture risk. We suggest intervention for fragility fracture for postmenopausal women should be guided by FRAX and HIT instead of bone mineral density alone.To explore the risk of fragility fracture in Taiwanese postmenopausal women with osteopenia using the hybrid intervention threshold (HIT) and Fracture Risk Assessment tool (FRAX).The Taiwan Osteoporosis Association (TOA) conducted a nationwide bone mineral density (BMD) survey between 2008 and 2011 using a bus equipped with a dual- X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) machine. All participants completed a structured questionnaire, which included the elements in the FRAX. Based on the results, the group made up of postmenopausal women with osteopenia was identified. In order to explore the risk of fragility fracture by HIT and FRAX among Taiwan postmenopausal women with osteopenia, the 10-year probability of fracture (FRAX score) and individual intervention threshold (IIT) in this group were calculated. If the FRAX score of a participant was higher than or equal to the IIT or fixed intervention threshold (FIT), the participant was considered as above the HIT (HIT could be reached by being over a threshold at either major osteoporotic fracture or hip fracture) and categorized as having a high FRAX fracture risk.A total of 13,068 postmenopausal women were enrolled in the program. A total of 5743 (43.9%) participants had osteopenia, of which 1434 (25.0%) had high FRAX fracture risk.One quarter of Taiwanese postmenopausal women with osteopenia had high fragility fracture risk evaluated by FRAX and HIT. Due to the poor sensitivity of BMD for fragility fracture, we suggest that intervention for fragility fracture for postmenopausal women should also be guided by FRAX and HIT instead of BMD alone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695343>In Silico Screening and Analysis of Broad-Spectrum Molecular Targets and Lead Compounds for Diarrhea Therapy.</a></h2><p>Diarrhoeal disease kills about 1.5 million human beings per year across the continents. The enterotoxigenic  (ETEC) pathotype has been noted as a major cause of diarrheal disease in human and livestock. The aim of this study is to identify broad-spectrum molecular targets in bacteria and broad-spectrum lead compounds (functional inhibitors) with high efficacy and no significant adverse implication on human systems, in relevance to diarrhea therapy through computational approaches which include phylogenetics, target prediction, molecular docking, and molecular flexibility dynamic simulations. Three molecular target genes, , and , which code for uridine diphosphate--acetylglucosamine-1-carboxyvinyltransferase, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase, and deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase III alpha subunit, respectively, were found to be highly conserved in 7 diarrhea-causing microbes. In addition, 21 potential compounds identified showed varied degree of affinity to these enzymes. At free  cutoff of -8.0 kcal/mol, the highest effective molecular target was DNA polymerase III alpha subunit (PDB ID: 4JOM) followed by UDP--acetylglucosamine-1-carboxyvinyltransferase (PDB ID: 5UJS), and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (PDB ID: 1ONN), while the highest effective lead compound was -coeleneterazine followed by amphotericin B, MMV010576, MMV687800, MMV028694, azithromycin, and diphenoxylate. The flexibility dynamics of DNA polymerase III alpha subunit unraveled the atomic fluctuation which potentially implicated Asp593 as unstable active site amino acid residue. In conclusion, bacteria  gene or its protein is a highly promising molecular target for the next generation of antibacterial drugs of the class of -coeleneterazine.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698317>Characterizing the interactions of the antipsychotic drug trifluoperazine with bovine serum albumin: Probing the drug-protein and drug-drug interactions using multi-spectroscopic approaches.</a></h2><p>Trifluoperazine is a potent antipsychotic drug used in the treatment of neurological disorders. The usage of trifluoperazine is often found to be associated with more adverse side effects as compared to other low-potency antipsychotic agents. Plasma proteins play an inevitable role in determining the pharmacokinetic properties of a drug. Hence, this study was conducted with an aim to characterize the interactions of trifluoperazine with bovine serum albumin and determine the influence of other small molecules on its interaction with serum albumin. Trifluoperazine bound to BSA at two independent sites with K values of 9.5 and 172.6 μM. Förster resonance  transfer and computational docking analysis revealed that both the binding sites of trifluoperazine were located closer to TRP 213 in subdomain IIA of BSA. Evaluation of trifluoperazine-BSA interactions at three different temperatures indicated that there was a stable complex formation between the two molecules at the ground state and that the static quenching mechanism was predominant behind these interactions. Binding studies in the presence of pharmaceutically relevant drugs indicated that warfarin, paracetamol, and caffeine negatively influenced the binding of trifluoperazine on BSA. Lastly, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy and circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated that the binding of trifluoperazine induced a conformational change by reducing the α-helical content of BSA. The study implicates that the small molecules which prefer binding to the Sudlow site I of BSA might compete with trifluoperazine for its binding site thereby increasing the concentration of free trifluoperazine in the plasma which could lead to adverse side effects in patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the accuracy of the Actiheart, a light portable monitor estimating AEE based on heart rate (HR) and activity counts (ACT), during two popular activities (running and cycling) performed at high intensities. The benefit of an individual calibration of the HR-AEE relationship established during a preliminary maximal test was also evaluated.AEE was estimated in eighteen active adults (4 women and 14 men; 25 ± 4 yr) with indirect calorimetry using a respiratory gas analysis system (reference method) and the Actiheart during 5-min running and cycling at 60, 75 and 85% of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) previously determined during a maximal test performed on a treadmill or cycle ergometer. For the Actiheart, AEE was estimated either using the group or individual calibrated equations available in the dedicated software, and their respective HR, ACT or combined HR/ACT algorithms.When the HR algorithm was used for cycling and the HR or HR/ACT algorithms for running, AEE measured by the Actiheart increased proportionally to exercise intensity from 60 to 85% VO2max (P<0.001). Compared to indirect calorimetry, the Actiheart group calibrated equations slightly to moderately underestimated (3 to 20%) AEE for the three exercise intensities (P<0.001). Accuracy of AEE estimation was greatly improved by individual calibration of the HR-AEE relationship (underestimation below 5% and intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]: 0.79-0.93) compared to group calibration (ICC: 0.64-0.79).The Actiheart enables to assess AEE during high intensity running and cycling when the appropriate algorithm is applied. Since an underestimation was present for group calibration, an individual and sport-specific calibration should be performed when a high accuracy is required.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694288>Intermediate-Salinity Systems at High Altitudes in the Peruvian Andes Unveil a High Diversity and Abundance of Bacteria and Viruses.</a></h2><p>Intermediate-salinity environments are distributed around the world. Here, we present a snapshot characterization of two Peruvian thalassohaline environments at high altitude, Maras and Acos, which provide an excellent opportunity to increase our understanding of these ecosystems. The main goal of this study was to assess the structure and functional diversity of the communities of microorganisms in an intermediate-salinity environment, and we used a metagenomic shotgun approach for this analysis. These Andean hypersaline systems exhibited high bacterial diversity and abundance of the phyla , , , and ; in contrast,  from the phyla , , and  were identified in low abundance. Acos harbored a more diverse prokaryotic community and a higher number of unique species compared with Maras. In addition, we obtained the draft genomes of two bacteria,  and , as well as the viral genomes of  lambda-like phage and -like phage and 27 partial novel viral halophilic genomes. The functional metagenome annotation showed a high abundance of sequences associated with detoxification, DNA repair, cell wall and capsule formation, and nucleotide metabolism; sequences for these functions were overexpressed mainly in bacteria and also in some archaea and viruses.

A major proportion of the fibers entering wastewater treatment plants end up in sewage sludge, which is used as a soil fertilizer in many countries. As their impacts in the terrestrial environment are still poorly understood, we studied the effects of polyester fibers on enchytraeids (Enchytraeus crypticus), springtails (Folsomia candida), isopods (Porcellio scaber) and oribatid mites (Oppia nitens), all playing an important role in soil decomposer food webs. We exposed these invertebrates in the laboratory to short (12 µm-2.87 mm) and long (4-24 mm) polyester fibers, spiked in soil or in food at five concentrations ranging from 0.02% to 1.5% (w/w) and using five replicates. Overall the effects of polyester fibers on the soil invertebrates were slight.  reserves of the isopods were slightly affected by both fiber types, and enchytraeid reproduction decreased up to 30% with increasing fiber concentration, but only for long fibers in soil. The low ingestion of long fibers by the enchytraeids suggests that this negative impact arose from a physical harm outside the organism, or from indirect effects resulting from changes in environmental conditions. The short fibers were clearly ingested by enchytraeids and isopods, with the rate of ingestion positively related to fiber concentration in the soil. This study shows that polyester fibers are not very harmful to soil invertebrates upon short-term exposure. However, longer lasting, multigeneration studies with functional endpoints are needed to reveal the possible long-term effects on soil invertebrates and their role in the decomposition process. This study also shows that polyester fibers can enter terrestrial food web via ingestion of fibers by soil invertebrates.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this aim, antibacterial thin films have been prepared using earth-abundant metals deposited using a high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS). The sputtered FeOx, CuxO and mixed CuxO-FeOx films exhibited fast bacterial inactivation properties under exposure to indoor light (340-720 nm) showing total bacterial inactivation within 180, 120 and 60 min, respectively. The photocatalytic mechanisms of these films were investigated, from the absorption of photons up to the bacteria's fate, by means of ultrafast transient spectroscopy, flow cytometry and malondialdehyde (MDA) quantification justifying the cell wall disruption. The primary driving force leading to bacterial inactivation was found to be the oxidative stress at the interface between the sputtered thin films and the microorganism. This was justified by using engineered porinless bacteria disabling the possible ions diffusion leading to internal bacterial inactivation. Such stress is a direct consequence of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs at the interface of the sputtered layers. By diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), we found that both FeOx and CuxO present a band gap ~2.9 eV (>425 nm), while the mixed CuxO-FeOx thin film has a band gap bellow 2.3 eV (>540 nm). The structure and atomic composition of the films was characterized by  dispersive X-ray, X-ray photoelectron and optical spectroscopy. While the composition and metal oxidation states are distinct in all three films, the difference in photocatalytic efficiency can, at first sight, be explained as direct consequence of their absorbance and the unique interaction between Fe and Cu-oxides in the composite film.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693694>Anti-Alzheimer potential, metabolomic profiling and molecular docking of green synthesized silver nanoparticles of Lampranthus coccineus and Malephora lutea aqueous extracts.</a></h2><p>The green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (SNPs) using plant extracts is an eco-friendly method.

Silver nanoparticles are a type of Noble metal nanoparticles and it has tremendous applications in the field of diagnostics, therapeutics, antimicrobial activity, anticancer and neurodegenerative diseases. In the present work, the aqueous extracts of aerial parts of Lampranthus coccineus and Malephora lutea F. Aizoaceae were successfully used for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles. The formation of silver nanoparticles was early detected by a color change from pale yellow to reddish-brown color and was further confirmed by transmission electron microscope (TEM), UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and -dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDX). The TEM analysis of showed spherical nanoparticles with a mean size between 12.86 nm and 28.19 nm and the UV- visible spectroscopy showed λmax of 417 nm, which confirms the presence of nanoparticles. The neuroprotective potential of SNPs was evaluated by assessing the antioxidant and cholinesterase inhibitory activity. Metabolomic profiling was performed on methanolic extracts of L. coccineus and M. lutea and resulted in the identification of 12 compounds, then docking was performed to investigate the possible interaction between the identified compounds and human acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and glutathione transferase receptor, which are associated with the progress of Alzheimer's disease.

Remarkably, the inferred nuclear modification factor of J/ψ at midrapidity in Au+Au (U+U) collisions reaches about 24 (52) for p_{T}<0.05  GeV/c in the 60%-80% collision centrality class. This noteworthy enhancement cannot be explained by hadronic production accompanied by cold and hot medium effects. In addition, the dN/dt distribution of J/ψ for the very low p_{T} range is presented for the first time. The distribution is consistent with that expected from the Au nucleus and shows a hint of interference. Comparison of the measurements to theoretical calculations of coherent production shows that the excess yield can be described reasonably well and reveals a partial disruption of coherent production in semicentral collisions, perhaps due to the violent hadronic interactions. Incorporating theoretical calculations, the results strongly suggest that the dramatic enhancement of J/ψ yield observed at extremely low p_{T} originates from coherent photon-nucleus interactions. In particular, coherently produced J/ψ's in violent hadronic collisions may provide a novel probe of the quark-gluon plasma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696698>Natural eumelanin and its derivatives as multifunctional materials for bio-inspired applications: a review.</a></h2><p>Natural melanin is a ubiquitous material that plays critical biofunctional roles in different living organisms.

In this work, three pumelo cultivars cvs "Hongroumiyou" (HR), "Bairoumiyou" (BR), and "Huangroumiyou" (HuR) were stored at 25 °C for 90 days, and juice sacs were sampled to explore the lignin accumulation and its relationship to sucrose and  depletion were investigated. The results displayed that HuR contained lower sucrose content, lower ATP level, but higher lignin content compared to BR and HR during postharvest storage, indicating that the sequence according to storage resistance on the basis of lignin content is as follows: HuR < BR < HR. Furthermore, sucrose degradation attributed to enhanced activities of neutral invertase (NI), soluble acid invertase (S-AI), cell wall-bound invertase (B-AI), and  deficit on account of declined ATP level, showed significantly negative correlation with lignin accumulation, suggesting that lignin accumulation occurrence could induce sucrose degradation and  deficit during postharvest storage. Additionally, higher activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), peroxidase (POD) could accelerate lignin synthesis and resulted in lignin accumulation during postharvest pumelo storage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698338>Ankle and Midfoot Power During Single-Limb Heel Rise in Healthy Adults.</a></h2><p>Although the midfoot is recognized to have an important role in the successful performance of a single-limb heel rise, healthy heel rise performance remains primarily characterized by ankle function. The purpose of this study was to examine the contribution of midfoot region power to single-limb heel rise in healthy adults. Participants (N = 12) performed 20 single-limb heel rises.

Inverse dynamic calculations were performed to obtain ankle and midfoot region powers. These data were evaluated with descriptive statistics. A correlation was performed to evaluate the contribution of midfoot region power to heel height, as heel height is a clinical measure of heel-rise performance. The midfoot contributed power during single-limb heel rise (peak positive power: 0.5 [0.2] W·kg-1). Furthermore, midfoot peak power accounted for 36% of the variance in heel height (P = .04).

Over the past few decades, flexible zinc-air batteries (FZABs), characterized by their extremely high theoretical  density from consuming oxygen in air and low cost, have been regarded as one of the most promising power supplies. However, their unique half-open structure poses great challenges for the environmental stability of their components, including the electrolyte and electrodes. As an important ionic conductor, the poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-KOH gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) has been widely utilized in FZABs. To date, most studies have focused on investigations of the electrode, electrocatalyst materials and battery configuration, while very few have paid attention to the influence of the environment on the electrolyte and the corresponding FZAB performance. Herein, for the first time, the environmental stability of PVA-KOH GPE, such as dimensional stability and water and ionic conductivity retention capability, for FZABs in ambient air has been thoroughly studied. Moreover, the properties of the assembled FZABs in terms of cycling stability, discharge performance and power output are investigated.

We found ANKO mice, which lack NAMPT in both BAT and WAT, had impaired gene programs involved in thermogenesis and mitochondrial function in BAT and a blunted thermogenic (rectal temperature, BAT temperature, and whole-body oxygen consumption) response to acute cold exposure, prolonged fasting, and administration of β-adrenergic agonists (norepinephrine and CL-316243). In addition, the absence of NAMPT in WAT markedly reduced adrenergic-mediated lipolytic activity, likely through inactivation of the NAD-SIRT1-caveolin-1 axis, which limits an important fuel source fatty acid for BAT thermogenesis. These metabolic abnormalities were rescued by treatment with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which bypasses the block in NAD synthesis induced by NAMPT deficiency. Although BANKO mice, which lack NAMPT in BAT only, had BAT cellular alterations similar to the ANKO mice, BANKO mice had normal thermogenic and lipolytic responses. We also found  expression in supraclavicular adipose tissue (where human BAT is localized) obtained from human subjects increased during cold exposure, suggesting our finding in rodents could apply to people. These results demonstrate that adipose NAMPT-mediated NAD biosynthesis is essential for regulating adaptive thermogenesis, lipolysis, and whole-body  metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697355>Patients with end-stage kidney disease have markedly abnormal cortical hip parameters by dual- X-ray absorptiometry.</a></h2><p>Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) have higher fracture rates and post-fracture mortality than the general population, but bone mineral density by dual- X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is less predictive of fracture in this patient group. Bone biopsy and high-resolution imaging indicate that cortical thickness (CT) is reduced and cortical porosity is increased in ESKD. The aim of this study was to assess cortical parameters using DXA in patients with ESKD. It was hypothesized that these parameters would show deterioration and be associated with fracture.Using advanced hip analysis, normal age-related ranges were determined from 752 female and 861 male femur scans and were compared with scans of 226 patients with ESKD at the time of transplantation.Compared with controls, female patients had lower mean±SD CT (mms) at the femoral neck (FN) (2.59 ± 1.42 versus 5.23 ± 1.85), calcar (3.46 ± 1.07 versus 5.09 ± 1.30) and shaft (4.42 ± 1.21 versus 7.44 ± 2.07; P < 0.001 for each), and buckling ratios were higher (8.21 ± 4.6 versus 3.63 ± 1.42; P < 0.001), indicating greater FN instability. All findings were similar for men. Prevalent fracture was documented in 28.8% of patients; 12.4% vertebral only, 8.4% non-vertebral only and 8% vertebral plus non-vertebral. In adjusted models, each 1 SD reduction in FN CT and increase in the buckling ratio was associated with a respective 1.73 (1.22-2.46)- and 1.82 (1.49-2.86)-fold increase in the risk of prevalent vertebral fracture.In patients with ESKD, DXA-derived cortical parameters are markedly abnormal compared with age- and sex-matched controls. These parameters should be assessed for incident fracture prediction and targeting treatment.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of ERA-EDTA.

The majority of these injuries are caused by motor vehicle collisions, and the rest are caused by falls and industrial or crush injuries. Pelvic vascular injuries are frequently associated with pelvic ring disruption and have a high mortality rate due to shock as a result of pelvic bleeding. Morbidity and mortality resulting from pelvic vascular injury are due to pelvic hemorrhage and resultant exsanguination, which is potentially treatable and reversible if it is diagnosed early with multidetector CT and treated promptly. The pelvic bleeding source can be arterial, venous, or osseous, and differentiating an arterial (high-pressure) bleed from a venous-osseous (low-pressure) bleed is of paramount importance in stratification for treatment. Low-pressure venous and osseous bleeds are initially treated with a pelvic binder or external fixation, while high-pressure arterial bleeds require angioembolization or surgical pelvic packing. Definitive treatment of the pelvic ring disruption includes open or closed reduction and internal fixation. Multidetector CT is important in the trauma setting to assess and characterize pelvic vascular injuries with multiphasic acquisition in the arterial and venous phases, which allows differentiation of the common vascular injury patterns. This article reviews the anatomy of the pelvic vessels and the pelvic vascular territory; discusses the multidetector CT protocols used in diagnosis and characterization of pelvic vascular injury; and describes the spectrum of pelvic vascular injuries, the differentiation of common injury patterns, mimics, and imaging pitfalls.

Benefits thought to be associated with these devices range from decreased post-operative pain and intraoperative bleeding, increased surgical speed, and reduced risk of post-surgical hemorrhage. Traditional electrocautery (EC) applies radiofrequency (RF) alternating current to generate high current density at the cutting blade tip and tissue interface resulting in extreme resistive heating of local tissue. that provides effective cutting and coagulation due to instantaneous boiling of fluid and tissue vaporization. The device operates at temperatures of between 300C–350C and the generated heat provides effective cutting and coagulation due to instantaneous boiling of fluid and tissue vaporization. It has been reported that the high temperature of the EC procedure is associated with some drawbacks, such as significant thermal damage to incised tissues, reduced surgical precision compared with a scalpel, potential injury to adjacent structures, and delayed wound healing. The cauterized surface area also increases subsequent inflammation and fluid sequestration into newly created tissue planes, resulting in seroma formation and increased risk of post-operative complications, such as infection. Pulsed-electron avalanche knife (PEAK) PlasmaBlade is a relatively new electrosurgical technology developed to minimize the collateral tissue damage caused by higher-heat instruments such as EC. It uses high-intensity RF pulses to create electrical plasma along the edge of a thin, flat, insulated electrode. The PEAK PlasmaBlade (PPB) system uses a lower amount of  translating into operating temperatures of about 40–140 °C, with a corresponding reduction in heat transfer and reduction in depth of thermal damage to adjacent tissues of approximately 50–90%. The PPB devices are available in several models designed for specific applications and are intended for tissue cutting and coagulation during general surgery. The objective of this report is to summarize the evidence regarding the comparative clinical effectiveness of PPB soft tissue dissection devices versus traditional EC for surgery and the cost-effectiveness of PPB use for surgery.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698270>Contamination of heavy metals and metalloids in biomass and waste fuels: Comparative characterisation and trend estimation.</a></h2><p>The use of contaminated biomass and waste fuels is essential for waste management, waste to  (WtE) and mitigating carbon emissions. The contamination of heavy metals and metalloids is specially concerned by environmental regulation and waste to  processes. In this study, comparative characterisation is performed for three typical contaminated biomass and waste fuels. i.e. recycled woods, combustible municipal solid waste, and industrial and commercial wastes. The contamination characteristics are further analysed using statistical methods (e.g. significance, correlation, profile, and principal component analyses) to identify specific contamination features, relations among the contaminants and potential contamination sources. Contamination trend is estimated based on the continuously monitoring fuel qualities, the driving forces for regulating and reduction of the contaminations, and potential changes in major contamination sources. The comparative characterisation combined with statistical analyses provides a better way to understand the contamination mechanisms. The approach can also relate the fuel contamination with the contamination sources and their changes for trend estimation. Generally, the toxic heavy metals and metalloids are expected to be significantly reduced due to stricter regulations, but there is no general trend for the reduction of other metals and metalloids because of the complicated changes in contamination sources and waste recycling streams in the near future.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To overcome this situation, heartbeat sound analysis is a convenient way to diagnose heart disease. Heartbeat sound classification is still a challenging problem in heart sound segmentation and feature extraction. Dataset-B applied in this study that contains three categories Normal, Murmur and Extra-systole heartbeat sound. In the purposed framework, we remove the noise from the heartbeat sound signal by applying the band filter, After that we fixed the size of the sampling rate of each sound signal. Then we applied down-sampling techniques to get more discriminant features and reduce the dimension of the frame rate. However, it does not affect the results and also decreases the computational power and time. Then we applied a purposed model Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Dropout, Dense and Softmax layer. As a result, the purposed method is more competitive compared to other methods.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697546>Time-Periodic Inertial Range Dynamics.</a></h2><p>A wide class of physical systems exhibit scale invariance.

The aim of this study was to investigate the sensitivity of human platelets to the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). Ligand binding was analyzed using I-labelled IGF-1 and insulin, and relative expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and insulin receptor (IR) was evaluated by Western blotting. Platelet aggregation in the presence of IGF-1 was studied by the plate aggregometry assay. We found that platelets from DM2 patients exhibited significantly higher IGF-1 binding and upregulation of IGF-1R expression in comparison with healthy individuals. Both insulin binding and IR expression were lower in the DM2 group, but the differences with the healthy control were statistically insignificant. The potentiating effect of IGF-1 on the thrombin-induced activation of platelets was detected in both groups but was significantly more pronounced in the DM2 patients. The initial rate of platelet activation in the presence of IGF-1 positively correlated with the concentration of glycated hemoglobin. Platelets isolated from DM2 patients displayed elevated expression of the IGF-1R subunits, which might have contributed to the higher sensitivity of these cells to IGF-1 in thrombin-initiated aggregation by increasing the rate of platelet activation. However, further experiments are needed to investigate the role of IGF-1 in thrombotic complications that usually accompany diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694271>Proposing a New Method Based on Image Analysis to Estimate the Segregation Index of Lightweight Aggregate Concretes.</a></h2><p>This work presents five different methods for quantifying the segregation phenomenon in lightweight aggregate concretes (LWAC). The use of LWACs allows greater design flexibility and substantial cost savings, and has a positive impact on the  consumption of a building. However, these materials are susceptible to aggregate segregation, which causes an irregular distribution of the lightweight aggregates in the mixture and may affect the concrete properties. To quantify this critical process, a new method based on image analysis is proposed and its results are compared to the well-established methods of density and ultrasonic pulse velocity measurement. The results show that the ultrasonic test method presents a lower accuracy than the other studied methods, although it is a nondestructive test, easy to perform, and does not need material characterization. The new methodology via image analysis has a strong correlation with the other methods, it considers information from the complete section of the samples, and it does not need the horizontal cut of the specimens or material characterization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695120>Closing the Loop of Satellite Soil Moisture Estimation via Scale Invariance of Hydrologic Simulations.</a></h2><p>Surface soil moisture plays a crucial role on the terrestrial water, , and carbon cycles. Characterizing its variability in space and time is critical to increase our capability to forecast extreme weather events, manage water resources, and optimize agricultural practices. Global estimates of surface soil moisture are provided by satellite sensors, but at coarse spatial resolutions. Here, we show that the resolution of satellite soil moisture products can be increased to scales representative of ground measurements by reproducing the scale invariance properties of soil moisture derived from hydrologic simulations at hyperresolutions of less than 100 m. Specifically, we find that surface soil moisture is scale invariant over regimes extending from a satellite footprint to 100 m. We use this evidence to calibrate a statistical downscaling algorithm that reproduces the scale invariance properties of soil moisture and test the approach against 1-km aircraft remote sensing products and through comparisons of downscaled satellite products to ground observations. We demonstrate that hyperresolution hydrologic models can close the loop of satellite soil moisture downscaling for local applications such as agricultural irrigation, flood event prediction, and drought and fire management.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697051>Magneto-Fluorescent Perovskite Nanocomposites for Directed Cell Motion and Imaging.</a></h2><p>The ability for a magnetic field to penetrate biological tissues without attenuation has led to significant interest in the use of magnetic nanoparticles for biomedical applications. In particular, active research is ongoing in the areas of magnetically guided drug delivery and magnetic hyperthermia treatment. However, the difficulties in tracing these optically nonactive magnetic nanoparticles hinder their usage in medical research or treatment. Here, a new perovskite-based magneto-fluorescent nanocomposite that allows the in situ, real-time optical visualization of magnetically induced cellular movements is reported. A swelling-deswelling technique is employed to capture a cesium lead halide perovskite and magnetite nanoparticles within a biocompatible polyvinylpyrrolidone matrix, to produce a water-dispersible composite that possesses a combination of strong magnetic response and intense fluorescence. The wavelength-tunability of perovskite nanocrystals is taken advantage of to demonstrate simultaneous multicolor fluorescent tagging of cancer stem cells. The magneto-directed motion of the cancer stem cells through a microfluidic channel is also imaged as a proof-of-concept toward an optically traceable magnetic manipulation of biological systems. These dual-functional nanocomposites could find promising applications in advanced biotechnologies, such as in optogenetics, cellular separation, and drug delivery studies.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this Article, we illustrate how recent theoretical developments can give this combination of concepts a similar predictive power in intermetallic chemistry, through the anticipation and discovery of structural complexity in the nominally MnP-type compound, IrSi. Analysis of the bonding scheme and DFT-Chemical Pressure (CP) distribution of the reported MnP-type structure exposes issues pointing towards new structural behavior. The placement of the Fermi  below an electronic pseudogap indicates that this structure is electron poor, an observation that can be traced via the 18-n rule to the structure's Ir-Ir connectivity. In parallel with this, the structure's CP scheme highlights facile paths of atomic motion that could enable a structural response to this electronic deficiency. Combined, these analyses suggest that IrSi may adopt a more complex structure than previously recognized. Through synthesis and detailed structural investigation of this phase, we confirm this prediction: single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals an incommensurately modulated structure with the (3+1)D superspace group P21/n(0βγ)00 and q ≈ -0.22b*+0.29c*. The structural modulations increase the average number of Ir-Ir bonds to nearly match the 18-n expectations of the phase through Ir-Ir trimerization along negative CPs, with the incommensurability arising from the difficulty of contracting and stretching the Ir-Ir contacts in a regular pattern without expanding the structure along directions of negative Si-Si CP. Integrating these results with prior analyses of related systems points to a simple guideline for materials design, the Frustrated and Allowed Structural Transitions (FAST) principle: the ease with which competing structural phenomena can be experimentally realized is governed by the degree to which they are supported by the coordination of the atomic packing and electronic factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697290>Superhigh out-of-plane piezoelectricity, low thermal conductivity and photocatalytic abilities in ultrathin 2D van der Waals heterostructures of boron monophosphide and gallium nitride.</a></h2><p>A stable 2D van der Waals (vdW) heterobilayer, constituted by boron monophosphide (BP) and Gallium Nitride (GaN) monolayers, has been explored for different kinds of  conversion and nanoelectronics. The nearly matched lattice constants of GaN and BP are commensurate with each other in their lattice structures. The out-of-plane inversion asymmetry coupled with the large difference in atomic charges between the GaN and BP monolayers induces in the heterobilayer a giant out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient (|d33|max ≈ 40 pm V-1), which is the highest ever reported in 2D materials of a finite thickness. It is much higher than the out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient reported earlier in multilayered Janus transition metal dichalcogenide MXY (M = Mo, W; X, Y = S, Se, Te) (|d33|max = 10.57 pm V-1). Such a high out-of-plane piezoelectricity found in a BP/GaN heterobilayer can bring about gigantic strain-tunable top gating effects in nanopiezotronic devices based on the same. Moreover, electron mobility (∼104 cm2 V-1 s-1) is much higher than that of transition metal dichalcogenides and conventional semiconductors. The origin of low lattice thermal conductivity (κL ∼ 25.25 W m-1 K-1) in BP/GaN at room temperature, which is lower than that of black phosphorene (78 W m-1 K-1), buckled arsenene (61 W m-1 K-1), BCN (90 W m-1 K-1), MoS2 (34.5 W m-1 K-1) and WS2 (32 W m-1 K-1) monolayers, has been systematically investigated via phonon dispersion, lattice thermal conductivity, phonon lifetime and mode Grüneisen parameters. The valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) arising from GaN and BP monolayers respectively result in a type II vdW heterobilayer, which is found to be thermodynamically favorable for photocatalytic water splitting in both acidic and neutral media. The exciton binding energies are comparable to those of MoS2 and C3N4 single layers, while the absorbance reaches as high as ∼105 cm-1 in the visible wavelength region. The emergence of high piezoelectricity, high carrier mobility, low lattice thermal conductivity and photocatalytic water splitting abilities in the proposed vdW heterobilayer signifies enormous potential for its versatile applications in nanoscale  harvesting, e.g., nano-sensors in medical devices, future nanopiezotronics, 2D thermoelectrics and solar  conversion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697509>DUNE as the Next-Generation Solar Neutrino Experiment.</a></h2><p>We show that the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), with significant but feasible new efforts, has the potential to deliver world-leading results in solar neutrinos.

The adsorption energies, extracted from the experimental data using an RRKM analysis, show a similar size dependence as the quantum chemical results and are in the range of ≈0.6-1.2 eV. Yttrium doping significantly alters the propene adsorption energies for n=5, 12 and 13. Chemical bonding and  decomposition analysis showed that there is no covalent bond between the cluster and propene, and that charge transfer and other non-covalent interactions are dominant. The natural charges, Wiberg bond indices, and the importance of charge transfer all support an electron donation/back-donation mechanism for the adsorption. Yttrium plays a significant role not only in the propene binding , but also in the chemical bonding in the cluster-propene adduct. Propene preferentially binds to yttrium in small clusters (n<10), and to a gold atom at larger sizes. Besides charge transfer, relaxation also plays an important role, illustrating the non-local effect of the yttrium dopant. It is shown that the frontier molecular orbitals of the clusters determine the chemical bonding, in line with the molecular-like electronic structure of metal clusters.© 2019 The Authors.

In this work, high performance self-powered broadband photodetectors were fabricated based on vertically stacked p-n heterojunctions though combining p-type WSe2 with n-type Bi2Te3 via van der Waals (vdW) epitaxial growth. Devices based on the p-n heterojunction show obvious current rectification behaviors in the dark and superior photovoltaic characteristics under light irradiation. Maximum short circuit current of 18 nA and open circuit voltage of 0.25 V can be achieved with the illumination light of 633 nm (power density: 26.4 mW/cm2), which are among the highest values compared with the ever reported 2D vdW heterojunctions synthesized by CVD method. Benefiting from the broadband absorption of the heterostructures, the detection range can be expanded from visible to near-infrared (375-1550 nm). Moreover, ascribing to the efficient carriers separation process at the junction interfaces, the devices can be further employed as self-powered photodetectors, where fast response time (≈210 μs) and high responsivity (20.5 A/W at 633 nm and 27 mA/W at 1550 nm) are obtained under zero bias voltage.

Modified beam models (MBM) for which the OFs of small fields (down to 1 × 1 cm) were increased by up to 12% compared to the original beam models (OBM) were created for two TPSs. These beam models were used to recalculate treatment plans of different complexity. Treatment plans using stereotactic 3D-conformal (s3D-CRT) for brain metastasis as well as VMAT plans for head and neck and prostate cancer patients were generated. Dose distributions calculated with the MBM and the OBM were compared to measured dose distributions acquired using film dosimetry and a 2D-detector-array. For the s3D-CRT plans the calculated and measured dose at the isocenter was evaluated. For VMAT, gamma pass rates (GPRs) were calculated using global gamma index with 3%/3 mm, 2%/3 mm, 1%/3 mm and 2%/2 mm with a 20% threshold. Contribution of small fields to the total fluence was expressed as the ratio (F) of fluence trough leaf openings smaller than 2 cm to the total fluence. Using film dosimetry for the s3D-CRT plans, the average of the ratio of calculated dose to measured dose at the isocenter was 1.01 and 1.06 for the OBM and MBM model, respectively. A significantly lower GPR of the MBM compared to the OBM was only found for the localized prostate cases ( = 12.4%) measured with the 2D-detector-array and an acceptance criterion of 1%/3 mm. The effects of uncertainties in small field OFs implemented in TPSs are most pronounced for s3D-CRT cases and can be clearly identified using patient specific quality assurance. For VMAT these effects mainly remain undetected using standard patient specific quality assurance. Using tighter acceptance criteria combined with an analysis of the fluence generated by small fields can help identifying inaccuracies of OFs implemented in TPSs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696207>Amelioration of heavy metal stress by endophytic Bacillusamyloliquefaciens RWL-1 in rice by regulating metabolic changes: potential for bacterial bioremediation.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to investigate the bioremediation efficiency of phytohormone-producing endophytic Bacillus amyloliquefaciens RWL-1 isolated from rice seeds. In this study, we tested RWL-1 against various heavy metals (Cu, Cr, Pb, and Cd). Among the tested heavy metals, RWL-1 showed highest tolerance for Cu stress and we observed alterations in growth kinetics with various Cu concentrations (1, 2.5, and 5 mM). We confirmed the biosorption potential of RWL-1 by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with -dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) showing that Cu ions were adsorbed on RWL-1 cell surfaces. We further tested RWL-1 for its plant growth promoting and stress reliance efficiency in response to a dose-dependent increase in soil Cu (1, 2.5, and 5 mM). The RWL-1 inoculation significantly increased seedling biomass and growth attributes compared with non-inoculated control seedlings without Cu stress. Moreover, RWL-1 inoculation significantly promoted a physiochemical response in seedlings with and without Cu stress by reducing Cu uptake, improving carbohydrate levels (glucose, sucrose, fructose, and raffinose), enhancing amino acids regulation, and augmenting antioxidant levels (POD, PPO and GHS). Levels of stress responsive phytohormones such as abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA) were significantly reduced in RWL-1-inoculated seedlings as compared with non-inoculated control seedlings under normal condition and same levels of Cu stress. In conclusion, the inoculation of B. amyloliquefaciens RWL-1 can significantly improve plant growth in Cu-contaminated soil and reduce metal accumulation, thus making plants safer for consumption. This approach could be tremendously helpful for safe and sustainable agriculture in heavy metal-contaminated areas.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694377>Fluorescence enhancement of aromatic macrocycles by lowering excited singlet state energies.</a></h2><p>A series of cyclo--phenylene congeners with a variation of interphenylene bridges were synthesized by adopting concise synthetic routes to investigate the structure-fluorescence relationships of macrocycles.

In this article, the model serves as the basis for an analysis aimed at determining a set of protective actions to be taken (e.g., increasing the number of monitoring devices, reducing the number of accesses to the safety-critical system) in order to effectively reduce the level of vulnerability of the safety-critical systems under consideration. In particular, the problem is here tackled within an optimization framework: the set of protective actions to implement is chosen as the one minimizing the overall level of vulnerability of a group of safety-critical systems. In this context, three different optimization approaches have been explored: (i) one single classification model is built to evaluate and minimize system vulnerability; (ii) an ensemble of compatible classification models, generated by the bootstrap method, is employed to perform a "robust" optimization, taking as reference the "worst-case" scenario over the group of models; (iii) finally, a distribution of classification models, still obtained by bootstrap, is considered to address vulnerability reduction in a "probabilistic" fashion (i.e., by minimizing the "expected" vulnerability of a fleet of systems). The results are presented and compared with reference to a fictitious example considering NPPs as the safety-critical systems of interest.© 2019 Society for Risk Analysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697468>Cathode Interfacial Layer Formation via In Situ Electrochemically Charging in Aqueous Zinc-Ion Battery.</a></h2><p>The issue of material dissolution is common in aqueous batteries, leading to serious performance deterioration.

Meanwhile, this in situ formed interface layer is advantageous for lowering impedance, ameliorating interface and reducing activation . As a result, significantly superior rate performance and cycle stability are exhibited. The observation of protective SEI layer in aqueous system may provide an insight to the development of high stability aqueous batteries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693829>Complete genome and calcium carbonate precipitation of alkaliphilic  sp. AK13 for self-healing concrete.</a></h2><p>Bacteria that are resistant to high temperatures and alkaline environments are essential for the biological repair of damaged concrete. Alkaliphilic and halotolerant  sp. AK13 was isolated from the rhizosphere of . Unlike other tested  species, the AK13 strain grows at pH 13 and withstands 11% (w/v) NaCl. Growth of the AK13 strain at elevated pH without urea promoted calcium carbonate (CaCO) formation. Irregular vaterite-like CaCO minerals that were tightly attached to cells were observed using field-emission scanning electron microscopy. -dispersive X-ray spectrometry, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the presence of CaCO around the cell. Isotope ratio mass spectrometry confirmed that the majority of CO ions in the CaCO were produced by cellular respiration rather than being derived from atmospheric carbon dioxide. The minerals produced from calcium acetate-added growth medium formed smaller crystals than those formed in calcium lactate-added medium. Strain AK13 appears to heal cracks on mortar specimens when applied as a pelletized spore powder. Alkaliphilic  sp.

Na-rich rocksalt oxides, NaMO (M = transition metal), combining cationic and anionic redox activity, could provide the necessary increase in capacity to achieve this goal, but their synthesis remains challenging compared to the Li analogues. As an alternative, mixed compounds Na(AM)O, with A being an electropositive cation such as Li, Mg, or Zn sitting in the transition-metal layer, have been reported. As a continuation, we herein prepared the mixed Na(LiIr)O phase and compared its structure and electrochemical properties with the well-known LiIrO and NaIrO parent materials. By mixing Na and Li in the material, the stacking sequence of the transition-metal honeycomb layers in Na(LiIr)O is modified compared to the two parent materials, resulting in the presence of extra superstructure peaks in X-ray diffraction data. Using electrochemical characterization and an in-situ X-ray diffraction technique, the mixed Na(LiIr)O was found to be unstable both in Li and Na batteries and to separate into Na-rich NaIrO and Li-rich LiIrO phases due to the competition between electrochemical (de)insertion, cation exchange with the electrolyte, and segregation of Na and Li in the material. These findings highlight important challenges and offer useful insight into guide the design of new mixed Na(AM)O cathode materials with high capacity for Na-ion batteries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697520>Multioscillating Boson Stars.</a></h2><p>We propose that stable boson stars generically fall within an infinite-parameter family of solutions that oscillate on any number of noncommensurate frequencies.

Cu-In-S NCs are the dominantly studied member of this important materials class and have been reported to contain optically-active defect states. However, there are minimal reports of In-free compositions that exhibit efficient PL. Here, we report a novel solution-phase synthesis of ~4 nm defective nanocrystals (DNCs) composed of Copper, Aluminum, Zinc, and Sulfur with ~20% quantum yield and an attractive PL maximum of 450 nm. Extensive spectroscopic characterization suggests the presence of highly localized electronic states resulting in reasonably fast PL decays (~1 ns), large vibrational  spacing, small Stokes shift, and temperature-independent PL linewidth and PL lifetime (between room temperature and ~5K). Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest PL transitions arise from defects within a CuAl 5 S 8 crystal lattice, which supports the experimental observation of highly-localized states. The results reported here provide a new material with unique optoelectronic characteristics that is an important analog to well-explored Cu-In-S NCs.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the specific mechanisms underlying these properties are unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the anti-tumor mechanisms of BBR in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The effects of BBR on NSCLC tumor development and programmed cell death were investigated both in vivo and in vitro. Luciferase reporter assays were used to determine whether tissue factor (TF) was a target of miR-19a.BBR suppressed NSCLC growth and promoted apoptosis in NSCLC cells by modulating miR-19a and TF expression.

Here, we report on a mechanistic study of a nanometer scale translational movement in two bistable rotaxanes. Both rotaxanes consist of a tetra-amide macrocycle interlocked onto a polyether axle. The macrocycle can shuttle between an initial succinamide station and a 3,6-dihydroxy- or 3,6-di--butyl-1,8-naphthalimide end stations. Translocation of the macrocycle is controlled by a hydrogen-bonding equilibrium between the stations. The equilibrium can be perturbed photochemically by either intermolecular proton or electron transfer depending on the system. To the best of our knowledge, utilization of proton transfer from a conventional photoacid for the operation of a molecular machine is demonstrated for the first time. The shuttling dynamics are monitored by means of UV-Vis and IR transient absorption spectroscopies. The polyether axle accelerates the shuttling by ~70 % compared to a structurally similar rotaxane with an all-alkane thread of the same length. The acceleration is attributed to a decrease in activation  due to an early transition state where the macrocycle partially hydrogen bonds to the ether group of the axle. The dihydroxy-rotaxane exhibits the fastest shuttling speed over a nanometer distance (τ ≈ 30 ns) reported to date. The shuttling in this case is proposed to take place via so-called harpooning mechanism where the transition state involves a folded conformation due to the hydrogen bonding interactions with the hydroxyl groups of the end station.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697939>Experimental infection by Neospora caninum in gerbil reduces activity of enzymes involved in  metabolism.</a></h2><p>Neospora caninum is a protozoan that has tropism for the central nervous system. The aim of this study was to determine whether experimental infection of gerbils would interfere with activity of enzymes associated with  metabolism. We randomized 20 gerbils into two groups (ten animals per group): the control group (healthy animals; uninfected) and the infected group (experimentally infected with dose 7.8 x 10 tachyzoites of N. caninum per gerbil). On day six and twelve post-infection (PI), brain and spleen tissues were collected for biochemical and histopathological analyses. No histopathological lesions were observed in the brains of infected animals; however, inflammatory infiltrates were found in the spleen. Significantly greater levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were observed in the brain and spleen of infected gerbils than in the control group at 12 days PI. Cytosolic creatine kinase (CK-CYT), mitochondrial creatine kinase (CK-MIT), and pyruvate kinase (PK) activities were lower in the brains of infected gerbils than in those of the control group on day 12 PI. There was significantly less CK-CYT activity in the spleens of infected gerbils on day 6 and 12 PI. Finally, there was significantly less sodium-potassium ion pump (Na/K ATPase) activity in the brains and spleens of infected gerbils on day 12 PI. These data suggest that experimental infection with N. caninum interfered with  metabolism associated with ATP homeostasis in the brain and spleen, directly or indirectly, apparently mediated by ROS overproduction, contributing to inhibition of Na/K ATPase activity.Copyright © 2019.

Participants were randomized between two sequences (placebo followed by MCT or MCT followed by placebo) and took MCT jelly or placebo jelly (canola oil) by mouth three times daily (total daily fat dose: 17.3 g MCT, or 19.7 g canola oil) for 30 days per phase. The primary outcome was cognition as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale, Chinese version (ADAS-Cog-C). The secondary outcome was self-care as measured by the activities of daily living scale (ADL) and changes in plasma metabolites.This study showed a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in ADAS-Cog-C scores between the MCT (2.62 points below baseline) and placebo interventions (2.57 points above baseline). Data from 46 (86.8%) APOE4 subjects who completed the entire study were analyzed. Changes in ADL scores were not significantly different between the MCT and placebo interventions (p > 0.05). The concentrations of TC, HDL-C, β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate were significantly higher in the MCT group than in the placebo group (p < 0.05).

The possibility of conducting hard x-ray photoexcitation and photoionization experiments under state-of-the art conditions in terms of photon and electron kinetic  resolution has become available only in the last few years. HAXPES has then produced structural and dynamical information at the level of detail already reached in the VUV and soft-x-ray ranges. The much improved experimental conditions have allowed extending to the hard x-ray range some methods well established in soft x-ray spectroscopies. Investigations of electron and nuclear dynamics in the femtosecond (fs, 10-15 sec) and even attosecond (as, 10-18 sec) regime have become feasible. Complex relaxation phenomena following deep-core ionization can now be enlightened in great detail. Other phenomena like e.g. recoil-induced effects are much more important in fast photoelectron emission, which can be induced by hard x-rays. Furthermore, a new kind of ionic states with double core holes can be observed by x-ray single-photon absorption.

However, there are very few studies reporting the physiological effects of cold with rain or wet-cold exposure on humans during exercise. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of rain on physiological responses during running exercise at 80% V̇Omax in the cold.Twelve healthy men (age: 21.7±3.3 years; height: 1.760±0.085 m; body weight: 68.8±7.1 kg; maximal oxygen consumption: 67.3±5.00 mL/kg/min) exercised on a treadmill at 80% V̇Omax intensity for 60 minutes with rain (RAIN) or not (CON) at 5 °C.Rectal temperature was significantly lower in RAIN than in CON at 10, 40, 50, and 60 minutes (P<0.05). Mean weighted skin temperature was significantly lower in RAIN than in CON during exercise (P<0.05). Oxygen consumption and rating of perceived exertion were significantly higher in RAIN than in CON at 50 and 60 minutes (P<0.05). Plasma lactate was significantly higher in RAIN than in CON at 10 minutes and from 40 to 60 minutes (P<0.05). Plasma norepinephrine levels were significantly higher in RAIN than in CON at 10 minutes and from 40 to 60 minutes (P<0.05).These results suggest that rain increased heat loss during the early phase of exercise in the cold, then heat production increased and transiently suppressed cold stress. However, with time, body heat loss intensified due to increasing wet area, and then  expenditure and plasma lactate increased due to cold stress. Therefore, rain may decrease exercise performance and affect sport safety.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698229>Interactive effect of the sorted components of solid recovered fuel manufactured from municipal solid waste by thermogravimetric and kinetic analysis.</a></h2><p>Solid recovered fuel (SRF) has the characteristics of high calorific value and low chlorine and mercury content. The thermal decomposition of SRF collected from a municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration power plant in Hangzhou was investigated in this study. The study exhibits far-reaching significance for the design and commercial operation of SRF pyrolysis facilities and circulating fluidized bed (CFB) power plants. The pyrolysis behavior of SRF and its sorted components was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TG). Five heating rates of 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 °C·min were conducted to analyze the effect of heating rate. The interactive effect of the sorted components was discussed by comparing the experimental and theoretical curves. Furthermore, the kinetic parameters were determined by using the Coats-Redfern (CR), Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) methods. The activation energies of SRF and its sorted components in the pyrolysis process were obtained. The main reaction stages of the SRF and its sorted components were described by different mechanism functions. However, it was found that the KAS and FWO methods were not applicable for SRF according to the comparison results. The results provide useful information for the design and commercial operation of SRF pyrolysis facilities and CFB power plants.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to evaluate dietary patterns and adherence to WHO healthy diet in children and adolescents and their associations with MetS.Subjects of this cohort study were selected from among children and adolescents of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study participants, aged 6-18 years (n = 424). Dietary measurements were collected using a valid and reliable food frequency questionnaire. MetS was defined as the existence of at least 3 risk factors according to the Cook criteria. Diet was assessed based on dietary components of the WHO healthy diet. Dietary patterns were defined by principal component analysis.The mean ± SD age of participants (42% boys and 57% girls) was 13.5 ± 3.7 years. The most consistency with the WHO healthy diet was observed for cholesterol, free sugar and protein consumption in both genders, and the least was for n-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acid, trans-fatty acid and salt. Intake of SFA up to 12% of  intake (third quartile) reduced the risk of MetS, compared to the first quartile. Subjects in the third quartile of n-6 poly-unsaturated fatty acid intake (6.2% of ) showed the lowest odds ratio of MetS compared to the first quartile (OR: 0.18, CI: 0.04-0.66). In the adjusted model, the risk of MetS reduced across quartiles of MUFA intake by 60% (OR: 1, 0.40, 0.40, 0.42; P trend = 0.05). No significant trends were observed in the risk of MetS components across quartiles of the WHO healthy diet components. Three major dietary patterns were identified, the healthy, unhealthy and cereal/meat. An increased risk of MetS was observed in the highest quartile of unhealthy dietary pattern score compared to the lowest quartile (OR: 1, 0.81, 0.93, 2.49; P trend = 0.03).Our results demonstrated that the majority of our population did not meet some components of WHO healthy diet recommendations.

To date, coarse-grained modeling has been successfully employed to simulate RNA folding dynamics on the  landscape composed of secondary structures. In such a modeling, the  barrier height between metastable structures is a key parameter that crucially affects the simulation results. Although a number of approaches ranging from the exact method to heuristic ones are available to predict the barrier heights, developing an efficient heuristic for this purpose is still an algorithmic challenge. We developed a novel RNA folding pathway prediction method, ACOfoldpath, based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). ACO is a widely used powerful combinatorial optimization algorithm inspired from the food-seeking behavior of ants. In ACOfoldpath, to accelerate the folding pathway prediction, we reduce the search space by utilizing originally devised structure generation rules. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we benchmarked ACOfoldpath on the known nineteen conformational RNA switches. As a result, ACOfoldpath successfully predicted folding pathways better than or comparable to the previous heuristics. The results of RNA folding dynamics simulations and pseudoknotted pathway predictions are also presented.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The constructed S-C-S heterojunction has a multilevel electron transport mechanism and synergistic effect, which provides the possibility of producing more organic fuel. The photocatalytic materials were characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, PL, etc. As a result, the atomic layer MoS/SnS/r-GO heterojunction exhibited a CO formation rate of 68.53 μmol g h and a CH formation rate of 50.55 μmol g h, respectively. This work opens up new prospects for the formation of heterojunctions of chalcogenide transition-metal sulfides.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696229>Sigma-1 receptor is a key genetic modulator in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</a></h2><p>Sigma-1 receptor (S1R) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone that regulates mitochondrial respiration but also controls cellular defense against ER and oxidative stress. This makes S1R a potential therapeutic target in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Especially, as a missense mutation E102Q in S1R has been reported in few familial ALS cases. However, the pathogenicity of S1RE102Q and the beneficial impact of S1R in the ALS context remain to be demonstrated in vivo. To address this, we generated transgenic Drosophila that express human wild-type S1R or S1RE102Q. Expression of mutant S1R in fly neurons induces abnormal eye morphology and locomotor defects in a dose-dependent manner. This was accompanied by abnormal mitochondrial fragmentation, reduced ATP levels and a higher fatigability at the neuromuscular junction during high  demand. Overexpressing IP3 receptor or glucose transporter mitigates the S1RE102Q-induced eye phenotype, further highlighting the role of calcium and  metabolism in its toxicity. More importantly, we showed that wild-type S1R rescues locomotor activity and ATP levels of flies expressing the key ALS protein, TDP43. Moreover, overexpressing wild-type S1R enhances resistance of flies to oxidative stress. Therefore, our data provide the first genetic evidence that mutant S1R recapitulates ALS pathology in vivo while increasing S1R confers neuroprotection against TDP43 toxicity.© The Author(s) 2019.

This can be exacerbated by interruptions caused by routine fasting for procedures and investigations. Our study aims to demonstrate that a volume based feeding protocol can overcome the barriers of underfeeding and safely increase  and protein delivery in UK intensive care patients, potentially improving clinical outcomes.In this single centre cohort study, data were collected from adult mechanically ventilated patients. We compared the standard care of rate based feeding, from an International Nutrition Survey (2014/15) to the new intervention of volume based feeding, in a mixed medical and surgical intensive care unit. The primary outcomes were the proportion of  and protein daily targets delivered. Secondary outcomes compared the effects on gastrointestinal tolerance, glycaemic control, mortality, mechanical ventilation days, length of stay in intensive care unit and hospital.From a total of 82 patients (rate based feeding = 27, volume based feeding = 55), volume based feeding patients received significantly more prescribed  (52% versus 81%; p < 0.001) and protein (40% versus 74%; p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in gastrointestinal symptoms such as gastric residual volumes (p = 0.62), glycaemic control (p = 0.94) or insulin usage (p = 0.75). Although there was an improvement in  and protein delivery, there were no differences in mechanical ventilation days (p = 0.12), mortality (p = 0.06), length of stay in intensive care unit (p = 0.93) and hospital (p = 0.72) between the groups.Compared to rate based feeding, volume based feeding significantly improved  and protein provision with no adverse effects on glycaemic control or gastrointestinal tolerance, clinical outcomes were not affected.© The Intensive Care Society 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695053>Dairy cows fed a low  diet before dry-off show signs of hunger despite ad libitum access.</a></h2><p>Drying-off is one important management step in commercial dairy farms and consists of ceasing milk production artificially at a specific point in time, generally 2 months before the next calving. Drying-off typically comprises dietary changes as well as gradual or abrupt changes in daily milking frequency, which may challenge the welfare of high-yielding cows. This study investigated the isolated and combined effects of different feed  densities (normal lactation diet versus -reduced diet, both offered ad libitum) and daily milking frequencies (twice versus once) on the feeding motivation of dairy cows on two separate days prior to dry-off (i.e. the day of last milking) using a push-gate feeder. During both days, cows on the -reduced diet pushed more than five times more weight to earn the final feed reward and were nearly ten times faster to feed on the first reward than cows on the normal lactation diet. Illustrating the importance of developing more animal welfare-friendly dry-off management, these results illustrate that cows show signs of hunger prior to dry-off when provided a diet with reduced  density, although offered for ad libitum intake.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697254>The analgesic efficacy of ultrasound guided unilateral transversus abdominis plane block in the pain management of shock wave lithotripsy.</a></h2><p>We conducted this study to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound guided unilateral transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block when used in combination with oral diclofenac administration during extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL).The study is a retrospective clinical experimental study conducted in a university hospital between January 2017 and January 2018.42 SWL eligible patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 (n: 15) received no medication due to patient's preference. Group 2 (n: 15) received 50 mg oral diclofenac 30 minutes prior to the procedure, and Group 3 (n: 12) received both oral diclofenac and unilateral ultrasound (US) guided TAP block 30 minutes before the procedure. Patient`s characteristics, SWL data and "visual analogue pain scale" (VAS) scores were collected and compared between groups.A total of 44 eligible patients were included in the study. When compared between groups, patient's characteristics including age, body mass index, and SWL data including stone size, SWL number, total  transmitted and duration of the procedure, were similar and there was no statistical significance. Between groups statistical significance was achieved in only VAS scores. Mean VAS scores in groups 1,2, and 3 were 6.3 ± 1.8, 4.3 ± 2.3, and 1.3 ± 1.0, respectively. No complication was seen in any of the groups.Pain relief during SWL operations is still a challenging issue for many clinicians. Our study demonstrates that, among many other anesthetic/analgesic agents and techniques described, unilateral US guided TAP block and diclofenac combination is a feasible option for pain relief during SWL procedures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696189>Visible-light-mediated direct C3-arylation of 2H-indazoles enabled by an electron-donor-acceptor complex.</a></h2><p>A mild visible-light-mediated, photocatalyst-free arylation of 2H-indazoles was developed.

HFF rats exhibited a significant increase in the gain of body weight, , and lipids compared to LF rats. HFF rats also showed hepatic insulin resistance, together with an increase in plasma triglycerides, cholesterol, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Hepatic lipids, triglycerides and cholesterol were higher in HFF rats, while a significant decrease in Stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity was found in this tissue. A marked increase in the protein amount of complex I, concomitant to a decrease in its contribution to mitochondrial respiration, was found in HFF rats. Lipid peroxidation and Nitro-Tyrosine content, taken as markers of oxidative stress, as well as NADPH oxidase activity, were significantly higher in HFF rats, while the antioxidant enzyme catalase decreased in these rats. Myeloperoxidase activity and lipocalin content increased, while peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma decreased in HFF rats. The present results provide evidence that middle-aged rats show susceptibility to a short-term "Western diet", exhibiting altered redox homeostasis, insulin resistance, and early mitochondrial alterations in the liver. Therefore, this type of dietary habits should be drastically limited to pursue a "healthy aging".</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694549>Unraveling genomic associations with feed efficiency and body weight traits in chickens through an integrative approach.</a></h2><p>Feed efficiency and growth rate have been targets for selection to improve chicken production. The incorporation of genomic tools may help to accelerate selection. We genotyped 529 individuals using a high-density SNP chip (600 K, Affymetrix®) to estimate genomic heritability of performance traits and to identify genomic regions and their positional candidate genes associated with performance traits in a Brazilian F Chicken Resource population. Regions exhibiting selection signatures and a SNP dataset from resequencing were integrated with the genomic regions identified using the chip to refine the list of positional candidate genes and identify potential causative mutations.Feed intake (FI), feed conversion ratio (FC), feed efficiency (FE) and weight gain (WG) exhibited low genomic heritability values (i.e. from 0.0002 to 0.13), while body weight at hatch (BW1), 35 days-of-age (BW35), and 41 days-of-age (BW41) exhibited high genomic heritability values (i.e. from 0.60 to 0.73) in this F population. Twenty unique 1-Mb genomic windows were associated with BW1, BW35 or BW41, located on GGA1-4, 6-7, 10, 14, 24, 27 and 28. Thirty-eight positional candidate genes were identified within these windows, and three of them overlapped with selection signature regions. Thirteen predicted deleterious and three high impact sequence SNPs in these QTL regions were annotated in 11 positional candidate genes related to osteogenesis, skeletal muscle development, growth,  metabolism and lipid metabolism, which may be associated with body weight in chickens.The use of a high-density SNP array to identify QTL which were integrated with whole genome sequence signatures of selection allowed the identification of candidate genes and candidate causal variants. One novel QTL was detected providing additional information to understand the genetic architecture of body weight traits. We identified QTL for body weight traits, which were also associated with fatness in the same population. Our findings form a basis for further functional studies to elucidate the role of specific genes in regulating body weight and fat deposition in chickens, generating useful information for poultry breeding programs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693959>Environmental analysis of a nano-grid: A Life Cycle Assessment.</a></h2><p>Renewable  sources are fundamental to face the problem of climate changes. Unfortunately, some resources, such as wind and solar radiation, have fluctuations affecting the electrical grids stability.  storage systems can be used for a smart  management to accumulate power from renewable sources. For such reason, these devices play a key role to achieve a sustainable electric system. On the other hand, they are affected by some environmental drawbacks mainly connected with the depletion of rare and expensive materials. Based on these considerations, in this study a nano-grid composed by a photovoltaic plant, a backup generator and an  storage system is analysed by an environmental Life Cycle Assessment approach. A Solar Home System is designed, and its environmental profile is evaluated considering several Lithium-ion batteries. Among them, nickel-cobalt aluminium oxide cells resulted to be the most suitable solution for a Solar Home System (46.66 Pts/MWh). Moreover, a sensitivity analysis of the Solar Home System is performed and a hybrid  storage plant integrating hydrogen and batteries is proposed to face the problem of seasonal solar radiation variability. Four scenarios having different gas pressure levels and lifespan of the devices are considered. Results show that currently the most sustainable configuration is represented by the Solar Home System, but in the future a hybrid nano-grid equipped with 700 bar hydrogen storage might be the best off-grid configuration for minimizing the impact on the environment (37.77 Pts/MWh). Extending the perspective of our analysis to future on-grid potential configurations, an efficient connection of the Solar Home System with a smart-grid is assessed as it looks more sustainable than other off-grid solutions (22.81 Pts/MWh).Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This effectively hybrid quantum-classical approach features both entanglement provided by a short quantum circuit, and the presence of an effective nonunitary operator at the same time. The functional form of this projector is borrowed from classical computation and is able to filter out high- components generated by a suboptimal variational quantum heuristic Ansatz.

This is justified by the analysis of experimental data on excitonic resonances, as extracted from magneto-optical measurements of a high-quality WSe_{2} ML encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and well reproduced with an analytically solvable Schrödinger equation when approximating the electron-hole potential in the form of a modified Kratzer potential. Applying our convention to other MoSe_{2}, WS_{2}, MoS_{2} MLs encapsulated in hBN, we estimate an apparent magnitude of δ for each of the studied structures. Intriguingly, δ is found to be close to zero for WSe_{2} as well as for MoS_{2} monolayers, what implies that the  ladder of excitonic states in these two-dimensional structures resembles that of Rydberg states of a three-dimensional hydrogen atom.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697478>Effect of β-Ketoiminato Ancillary Ligand Modification on Emissive Properties of New Iridium Complexes.</a></h2><p>A series of new bis(benzo[]quinolinato) Ir(III) complexes with modified β-ketoiminato ancillary ligands were synthesized, and their electrochemical, photophysical properties were determined with the support of theoretical calculations. Moreover, all the synthesized heteroleptic Ir(III) complexes were examined as dopants of the host-guest type emissive layers in solution-processed phosphorescent organic light emitting diodes (PhOLEDs) of a simple structure. As expected on the basis of voltammetry measurements as well as DFT calculations, all the compounds appeared to be green emitters. Their examination showed that alteration of β-ketoiminato ligand structure causes frontier orbitals'  levels to be slightly changed, while significantly affecting photoluminescence and electroluminescence efficiencies of iridium phosphors containing these ligands. It was also found that modification of ancillary ligands might enhance charge trapping on the dopant, thus increasing its efficiency, especially in electroluminescence. From among the iridium complexes studied, the compound bearing 1-naphthyl group bonded to the nitrogen atom of the ancillary ligand proved to be the most efficient emitter. The PhOLED fabricated on the basis of this dopant has reached a luminance level of 16000 cd/m, current efficiency close to 12 cd/A, and an external quantum efficiency around 3.2%.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696014>Minimally Invasive Lumbopelvic Fixation for Unstable U-Type Sacral Fractures.</a></h2><p>Multi-planar transverse, U-type, and vertical sacral fractures occur from high  trauma or as pathologic fractures and often have associated neurologic and extremity injuries. Modern treatment algorithms fall into two broad categories: 1) percutaneous posterior pelvic fixation (iliosacral or transiliac-transsacral screws) or 2) lumbopelvic fixation. Posterior pelvic screw fixation is minimally invasive but typically requires restricted weight bearing until fracture union. In many cases, lumbopelvic fixation allows for a closed reduction and provides stability to allow full weight bearing immediately after surgery; however, this fixation is often removed in a second surgery after fracture healing. Lumbopelvic fixation was originally described as an open procedure, minimally invasive lumbopelvic fixation is a recent variation and has shown promising results with less morbidity. We present a case series of unstable U-type sacral fractures treated with minimally invasive lumbopelvic fixation with staged hardware removal to illustrate the advantages and complications associated with this new technique. Ten patients with U-type sacral fractures underwent minimally invasive lumbopelvic fixation from 2016 to 2019. Six patients underwent scheduled hardware removal an average of 3.5 (range 1.9-5.5) months after index surgery. Two patients did not undergo hardware removal due to short life expectancy and diagnosis of pathologic fractures. One patient was lost to follow-up. One patient had failed fracture reduction and went on to sacral malunion that required a late sacral extension osteotomy to restore her ability to stand upright. Final disposition of all nine patients with follow-up was normal standing upright posture and normal ambulation without assistive device. There were no late displacements on postoperative upright radiographs. Complex sacral fractures are a challenging injury that can be treated with percutaneous posterior pelvic or lumbopelvic fixation. Lumbopelvic fixation offers the advantages of closed reduction to restore pelvic incidence and immediate weight bearing but has greater surgical morbidity than percutaneous posterior pelvic fixation and often requires hardware removal. The morbidity of lumbopelvic fixation may be reduced with minimally invasive techniques. Minimally invasive lumbopelvic fixation is a treatment option to be considered for complex sacral fractures.Copyright © 2019, Shah et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695078>Preventative and Therapeutic Effects of Low-dose Ionizing Radiation on the Allergic Response of Rat Basophilic Leukemia Cells.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of allergies has increased over the last four decades. In allergic reactions, mast cells induce a hypersensitive immune response to a substance that is normally harmless. Ionizing radiation has different biological effects depending on the dose and dose rate. In this study, we investigated whether low-dose irradiation before (preventative effect) or after (therapeutic effect) an antigen-antibody reaction has an anti-allergic effect. To test this, we activated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) mast cells with anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl IgE (antibody) and 2,4-dinitrophenyl human serum albumin, which served as an antigen. To test for both the potential of a preventative effect and a therapeutic effect, we irradiated mast cells both before and after mast cell activation, and we measured mediator release and signaling pathway activity. Low-dose ionizing radiation suppressed mediator release from RBL-2H3 mast cells activated by the antigen-antibody reaction regardless of when the mast cells were irradiated. These results were due to the suppression of FcεRI expression. Therefore, we suggest that low-dose ionizing radiation has a preventative and therapeutic effect in allergic reactions via the FcεRI-mediated RBL-2H3 mast cell activation system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694372>Molecular Engineering on Bis(Benzothiophene-S,S-Dioxide)-Based Large Band-Gap Polymers for Interfacial Modifications in Polymer Solar Cells.</a></h2><p>The development of effectively universal interfacial materials for both conventional and inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs) plays a very crucial role in achieving highly photovoltaic performance and feasible device engineering. In this study, two novel alcohol-soluble conjugated polymers (PBSON-P and PBSON-FEO) with bis(benzothiophene-S,S-dioxide)-fused aromatics (FBTO) as core unit and amino as functional groups are synthesized. They are utilized as universal cathode interfacial layers for both conventional and inverted PSCs simultaneously. Ascribing to the enlarged conjugated planarity and higher electron affinity for FBTO unit, both of PBSON-P and PBSON-FEO exhibit versatile electron-transporting abilities. They show wide band gaps that are important for light absorption in inverted PSCs, at which point PBSON-P and PBSON-FEO are more progressive than some of the reported small band-gap cathode interfacial materials. Importantly, PBSON-P and PBSON-FEO display deep HOMO  levels, which can block holes at the cathode and thus increase fill factor. As a result, both of conventional and inverted PSCs using PBSON-P and PBSON-FEO as cathode interlayers realize high photovoltaic performance. Therefore, this series of novel polymers are amphibious cathode interfacial materials for high-performance conventional and inverted PSCs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693390>Mitochondria: at the crossroads of regulating lung epithelial cell function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</a></h2><p>Disturbances in mitochondrial structure and function in lung epithelial cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Such disturbances not only affect cellular  metabolism, but also alter a range of indispensable cellular homeostatic functions in which mitochondria are known to be involved. These range from cellular differentiation, cell death pathways and cellular remodeling to physical barrier function and innate immunity, all of which are known to be impacted by exposure to cigarette smoke and have been linked to COPD pathogenesis. Next to their well-established role as the first physical frontline against external insults, lung epithelial cells are immunologically active. Malfunctioning epithelial cells with defective mitochondria are unable to maintain homeostasis and respond adequately to further stress or injury, which may ultimately shape the phenotype of lung diseases. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of cigarette smoke on the development of mitochondrial dysfunction in the lung epithelium and highlight the consequences for cell function, innate immune responses, epithelial remodeling and epithelial barrier function in COPD. We also discuss the applicability and potential therapeutic value of recently proposed strategies for the restoration of mitochondrial function in the treatment of COPD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698170>Darcy-Forchheimer hybrid (MoS, SiO) nanofluid flow with entropy generation.</a></h2><p>The aim of this articles is to investigate the entropy optimization in Darcy-Forchheimer hybrid nanofluids flow towards a stretchable surface.

Skin friction coefficient and Nusselt number are numerically computed for various interesting parameters for both nanoparticles (SiO and MoS). From obtained results it is noted that entropy optimization enhances against larger estimation of radiation and porosity parameters.

The recent detection of benzonitrile (BN, cyanobenzene, C6H5CN) in the interstellar medium suggests the existence of its protonated form (H+BN) in both the gas phase and in or on ice grains. Herein, we analyze the vibrational signatures of size-selected protonated clusters composed of BN and water (W, H2O), H+(BN-Wn=1-6), in the XH stretch range (X = C, N, O) with the aid of dispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations (B3LYP-D3/aug-cc-pVTZ). The size-dependent frequency shifts provide detailed insight about the site of protonation and the structure of the hydration shell. For n = 1, the proton is attached to the N atom of the CN group in BN, and W acts as a proton acceptor in an NHO ionic hydrogen bond (H-bond) of a H+BN-W type structure with cation-dipole configuration. For n ≥ 2, the proton is transferred to the H-bonded hydration network, consistent with thermochemical arguments arising from both the relative proton affinities of BN and Wn and the solvation energies. In these proton-transferred BN-H+Wn structures, the excess proton is more or less localized at a H3O+ hydronium core solvated by neutral W and BN ligands. At least for the considered cluster size (n ≤ 6), the BN impurity molecule is located in the first solvation shell of the H3O+ ion, consistent with the larger electric dipole moment and proton affinity of BN as compared to W. However, the  gap between these structures and surface isomers with BN solvated further away from the charge decreases with cluster size, suggesting that BN is located at the surface in large BN-H+Wn clusters. While for smaller clusters (n ≤ 4) the hydration network prefers branched structures at T = 0 K, in larger clusters (n ≥ 5) cyclic configurations with four- or five-membered H+Wn rings are most stable because they feature more H-bonds than the branched structures. Comparison with bare H+Wn clusters reveals the substantial effects of the perturbation by the BN impurity on the structure of the hydration network.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693970>Using EEM-PARAFAC to probe NF membrane fouling potential of stabilized landfill leachate pretreated by various options.</a></h2><p>Pretreatment processes substantially modify the organic composition of landfill leachate, which affect the fouling behavior in the post-treatment of membrane filtration. In this study, the changes in the chemical composition of stabilized landfill leachate upon various pretreatments, which encompassed coagulation/flocculation (C/F), ion exchange resins (MIEX), granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption, and their combinations, were tracked via excitation emission matrix - parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC), and the membrane fouling potentials were assessed in the subsequent processes of nanofiltration (NF). Fluorescence components, fulvic-like (C1), protein-like (C2), and humic-like (C3), were identified and validated using EEM-PARAFAC. MIEX and C/F pretreatments were not effective to remove C1 and C2, which were associated with relatively small sized and hydrophilic molecules. GAC adsorption did not show any preference with the removal towards different components. These differences in the chemical heterogeneity among the variously pretreated leachates led to the discrepancies in membrane fluxes at a similar leachate concentration. The result also signified the importance of probing the chemical composition of pretreated leachate for the optimization of the post membrane filtration. The sum of C2 and C3 in the pretreated leachate showed a good correlation with reversible membrane fouling resistance (r = 0.93; p < 0.05), while C1 was highly correlated with irreversible membrane resistance (r = 0.872; P < 0.05). These findings provided a new insight into the applicability of fluorescence spectroscopy for tracking the changes in the membrane fouling potential of stabilized landfill leachate after various pretreatments.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Brucellosis prediction plays an important role in its prevention and treatment. This paper establishes relationships between human brucellosis (HB) and land surface temperature (LST), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). A seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous variables (SARIMAX) model is constructed to predict trends in brucellosis rates. The fitted results (Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) = 807.58, Schwarz Bayes Criterion (SBC) = 819.28) showed obvious periodicity and a rate of increase of 138.68% from January 2011 to May 2016. We found a significant effect between HB and NDVI. At the same time, the prediction part showed that the highest monthly incidence per year has a decreasing trend after 2015. This may be because of the brucellosis prevention and control measures taken by the Chinese Government.

We use a classic  allocation model for annual plants to compare a strategy for reproductive timing that follows a temperature sum rule (TSR) with a strategy that follows an optimal control rule (OCR) maximizing reproductive output. We show that the OCR corresponds to a certain TSR regardless of how temperature is distributed over the growing season as long as the total temperature sum over the whole growing season is constant between years. We discuss such scenarios, thus outlining under which type of variable growth conditions TSR maximizes reproductive output and should be favored by natural selection. By providing an ultimate explanation for a well-documented empirical pattern this finding enhances the credibility of temperature sums as predictors of the timing of biological events. However, TSR and OCR respond in opposite directions when the total yearly temperature sum changes between years, representing, for example, variation in the length of the growing season. Our findings have implications for predicting optimal responses of organisms to climatic changes and suggest under which conditions natural selection should favor photoperiod versus temperature control.© 2019 The Authors.

Planetary health and human health are interconnected, and both need to be considered by individuals and governments while addressing several SDGs.The concept of the Nature Step has evolved from innovative research indicating, how changed lifestyle in urban surroundings reduces contact with biodiverse environments, impoverishes microbiota, affects immune regulation and increases risk of NCDs. The Nature Step calls for strengthening connections to nature. Physical activity in natural environments should be promoted, use of fresh vegetables, fruits and water increased, and consumption of sugary drinks, tobacco and alcohol restricted. Nature relatedness should be part of everyday life and especially emphasized in the care of children and the elderly. Taking "nature" to modern cities in a controlled way is possible but a challenge for urban planning, nature conservation, housing, traffic arrangements,  production, and importantly for supplying and distributing food. Actions against the well-known respiratory risk factors, air pollution and smoking, should be taken simultaneously.In Finland and elsewhere in Europe, successful programmes have been implemented to reduce the burden of respiratory disorders and other NCDs. Unhealthy behaviour can be changed by well-coordinated actions involving all stakeholders. The growing public health concern caused by NCDs in urban surroundings cannot be solved by health care alone; a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory.© The Author(s) 2019.</p></html>
