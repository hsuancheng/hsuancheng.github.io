<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3020581>Essential fatty acid deficiency: a new look at an old problem.</a></h2><p>Essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency is a useful tool to study the role of arachidonate and its metabolites in various physiologic and pathologic states. Recent studies have clarified the effects of EFA deficiency on membrane arachidonate and its metabolites, and have demonstrated that 20:3(n-9) (which accumulates in EFA deficiency) can be metabolized to a variety of eicosanoids. EFA deficiency has been shown to exert an anti-inflammatory effect. The mechanism of this effect may in part be mediated through a decrease in leukocyte leukotriene formation. In contrast, studies using the novel fatty acid, columbinic acid, have shown that the epidermal dysfunction seen in EFA deficiency may be a function of linoleate and its lipoxygenase metabolites rather than of arachidonate and the prostaglandins. Finally, it has recently been shown that EFA deficiency potentiates the effects of volatile anesthetics. EFA deficiency may thus provide a useful tool to investigate the molecular mechanism of these drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7342139>Columbinic acid, a new type of essential fatty acid.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/987806>The manipulation of the fatty acid composition of Dictyostelium discoideum and its effect on cell differentiation.</a></h2><p>The fatty acid composition of Dictyostelium discoideum has been modified by growing the axenic strain, Ax-2, in media conta-ning long chain polyenoic fatty acids. Large amounts of linoleic and linolenic acids are incorporated into the cellular lipids and further desaturated to two unusual fatty acids,  and 5,9,12,15-octadecatetraenoic acid, respectively. Arachidonic acid is also extensively incorporated but not further de;aturated. D. discoideum normally contains none of the above polyenoic fatty acids, and the amount incorporated depends upon the concentration of the fatty acid in the growth media. The cells containing large quantities of polyenoic fatty acid grow normally b,t exhibit impaired differentiation when removed from the growth medium. The incorporation of smaller quantities of the fatty acid has no adverse effect on differentiation. Cells grown in the presence of saturated or monoenoic fatty acids exhibit, at the most, only slight changes in the fatty acid composition of the cellular lipid and both grow and differentiate normally.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25916176>Activity of dietary fatty acids on FFA1 and FFA4 and characterisation of  as a dual FFA1/FFA4 agonist with potential effect against  diseases.</a></h2><p>Various foods are associated with effects against  diseases such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes; however, their mechanisms of action are mostly unclear. Fatty acids may contribute by acting as precursors of signalling molecules or by direct activity on receptors. The medium- and long-chain NEFA receptor FFA1 (free fatty acid receptor 1, previously known as GPR40) has been linked to enhancement of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, whereas FFA4 (free fatty acid receptor 4, previously known as GPR120) has been associated with insulin-sensitising and anti-inflammatory effects, and both receptors are reported to protect pancreatic islets and promote secretion of appetite and glucose-regulating hormones. Hypothesising that FFA1 and FFA4 mediate therapeutic effects of dietary components, we screened a broad selection of NEFA on FFA1 and FFA4 and characterised active compounds in concentration-response curves. Of the screened compounds, , a constituent of pine nut oil, was identified as a relatively potent and efficacious dual FFA1/FFA4 agonist, and its suitability for further studies was confirmed by additional in vitro characterisation. Pine nut oil and free and esterified pure  were tested in an acute glucose tolerance test in mice. Pine nut oil showed a moderately but significantly improved glucose tolerance compared with maize oil. Pure  or ethyl ester gave robust and highly significant improvements of glucose tolerance. In conclusion, the present results indicate that  is a comparatively potent and efficacious dual FFA1/FFA4 agonist that exerts antidiabetic effects in an acute mouse model. The compound thus deserves attention as a potential active dietary ingredient to prevent or counteract  diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27449469>Composition and Bioactivity of Lipophilic Metabolites from Needles and Twigs of Korean and Siberian Pines (Pinus koraiensis Siebold & Zucc. and Pinus sibirica Du Tour).</a></h2><p>Lipophilic extractive metabolites in different parts of the shoot system (needles and defoliated twigs) of Korean pine, Pinus koraiensis, and Siberian pine, Pinus sibirica, were studied by GC/MS. Korean pine needles comprised mainly bornyl p-coumarate, heterocyclic 15-O-functionalized labdane type acids (lambertianic acid), 10-nonacosanol, sterols and their esters. While Siberian pine needles contained less bornyl p-coumarate, lambertianic acid, sterols and their esters, but were richer in other 15-O-functionalized labdane type acids. The major components of the twig extract of P. koraiensis were lambertianic acid, abietane and isopimarane type acids, cembrane type alcohols, 8-O-functionalized labdanoids, sterols, sterol esters, and acylglycerols. The same extract of P. sibirica differed in larger amounts of other 15-O-functionalized labdane type acids and  glycerides, but in less quantities of cembranoids and 8-O-functionalized labdanoids. The labdane type pinusolic acid was detected for the first time in Korean pine. P. koraiensis was found to be unique in the genus for an ability to synthesize phyllocladane diterpenoids. The content of bound Δ -unsaturated polymethylene-interrupted fatty acids in the twig extracts of the both pines was similar or superior to that in their seed oil. Among the pines' metabolites tested isocembrol was strongest in inhibition of both α-glucosidase (IC 2.9 μg/ml) and NO production in activated macrophages (IC 3.6 μg/ml).© 2017 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6092909>Effect of fatty acids of omega 6 series on the biosynthesis of arachidonic acid in HTC cells.</a></h2><p>The influence of the preincubation of HTC cells with fatty acids of omega 6 series and columbinic acid (5t, 9c, 12c 18:3) on the biosynthesis of arachidonic acid was studied. The cells were incubated on a chemically defined medium with or without the addition of unlabeled linoleic, gamma-linolenic, eicosatrienoic, arachidonic, docosatetraenoic, docosapentaenoic and columbinic acids. After 24 hr of preincubation in the presence of the aforementioned fatty acids, [1-14C]eicosa-8,11,14-trienoic acid was added to the culture medium as the only lipidic source. Twenty-four hours later the synthesis of arachidonic acid and the fatty acid composition of the cells were determined. At 20 microM concentration the omega 6 fatty acids studied except docosapentaenoic acid produced an increase on the biosynthesis of arachidonic acid compared to the cells incubated in the absence of unlabeled fatty acids in the medium. The fatty acids added to the culture medium were incorporated into the cells and modified their fatty acid composition. Columbinic acid, with a similar structure to linoleic acid, also produced a significant increase on the conversion of eicosatrienoic acid to arachidonic acid. These results would suggest that the effect of both, linoleic and columbinic acids, may be adscribed to their configuration and not necessarily to their transformation in higher homologs, since columbinic acid is unable to be desaturated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22070203>Effects of heat and ultraviolet radiation on the oxidative stability of pine nut oil supplemented with carnosic acid.</a></h2><p>The effects of carnosic acid (CA) of different concentrations (0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/g) and two common antioxidants (butylated hydroxytoluene and α-tocopherol) on oxidative stability in pine nut oil at different accelerated conditions (heating and ultraviolet radiation) were compared. The investigation focused on the increase in peroxide and conjugated diene values, as well as free fatty acid and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. The changes in trans fatty acid and aldehyde compound contents were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, while the changes in  content were monitored by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results show that CA was more effective in restraining pine nut oil oxidation under heating, UV-A and UV-B radiation, in which a dose-response relationship was observed. The antioxidant activity of CA was stronger than that of α-tocopherol and butylated hydroxytoluene. Pine nut oil supplemented with 0.2 mg/g CA exhibited favorable antioxidant effects and is preferable for effectively avoiding oxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26111478>Phospholipid Incorporation of Non-Methylene-Interrupted Fatty Acids (NMIFA) in Murine Microglial BV-2 Cells Reduces Pro-Inflammatory Mediator Production.</a></h2><p>Sciadonic acid (SCA),  (PNA), and Δ7-eicosatrienoic acid (Δ7-ETrA) are three non-methylene-interrupted fatty acids (NMIFA). Using murine microglial BV-2 cells, this study determined how NMIFA incorporation modulated phospholipid fatty acid composition and the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Each NMIFA was rapidly taken up and incorporated in BV-2 cells, resulting in the differential redistribution of total lipids. The cellular phospholipid fatty acid compositions were altered, and a significant decrease in the proportions of total monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) was observed while the proportions of NMIFA and its metabolites accounted for 38% of the fatty acid total. Incubation of microglial cells with NMIFA suppressed production of LPS-stimulated pro-inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), as well as the over-expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and type 2 cyclooxygenase (COX-2). These inhibitory effects could be accounted for, in part, by the inactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling. In conclusion, Δ7-ETrA, PNA, and SCA are anti-inflammatory NMIFA that may be useful in suppressing in vitro immune responses involved in neural inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306361>Preparation of highly purified  from pine nut oil using a combination of enzymatic esterification and urea complexation.</a></h2><p> (PLA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid of plant origin. PLA has been successfully enriched according to a two-step process involving lipase-catalysed esterification and urea complexation. For the first step, the fatty acids present in pine nut oil were selectively esterified with lauryl alcohol using Candida rugosa lipase. Under the optimum conditions of 0.1% enzyme loading, 10% additional water, and 15 °C, PLA was enriched up to 43 mol% from an initial value of 13 mol% in the pine nut oil. For the second step, the PLA-enriched fraction from the first step was subjected to a urea complexation process. In this way, PLA enrichments with purities greater than 95 mol% were obtained at urea to fatty acid ratios greater than 3:1 (wt/wt), and 100% pure PLA was produced at a urea to fatty acid ratio of 5:1 with an 8.7 mol% yield.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

PLA-enriched free fatty acids (FFAs) containing ∼86 mol % PLA were produced from an FFA fraction obtained from pine nut oil (PLA content, ∼13 mol %) by urea crystallization. Commercial MGDGs (5 mg) were acidolyzed with PLA-enriched FFAs using four commercial immobilized lipases as biocatalysts. The reaction was performed in acetone (4 mL) in a stirred-batch reactor. Lipozyme RM IM (immobilized Rhizomucor miehei lipase) was the most effective biocatalyst for the reaction. Structured MGDGs containing 42.1 mol % PLA were obtained under optimal reaction conditions: temperature, 25 °C; substrate molar ratio, 1:30 (MGDGs/PLA-enriched FFAs); enzyme loading, 20 wt % of total substrates; and reaction time, 36 h. The structured MGDGs were separated from the reaction products at a purity of 96.6 wt % using silica column chromatography. The structured MGDGs could be possibly used as emulsifiers with appetite-suppression effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9748638>Methylene-interrupted double bond in polyunsaturated fatty acid is an essential structure for  by the fatty acid chain elongation system of rat liver.</a></h2><p>Some plant oils contain non-methylene-interrupted polyunsaturated fatty acids (NMIFAs).  (all cis delta-5,9,12/18:3) and columbinic acid (trans,cis,cis delta-5,9,12/18:3) are NMIFAs that exist in pine seed oil and columbine seed oil, respectively. We investigated the double bond position of fatty acid recognized by the fatty acid chain elongation system (FACES) of rat liver using NMIFAs as experimental tools. In the total elongation assay, amounts of C2 unit chain-elongated metabolites of  and columbinic acid were 32% and 11%, respectively, compared to that of gamma-linolenic (all cis delta-6,9,12/18:3) as the substrate. In the condensation reaction assay, the rate limiting step of FACES, the conversion rates of  and columbinic acid to the corresponding C20 beta-keto fatty acids were 19% and 9% of that of gamma-linolenic acid, respectively. The formation of elongated metabolite of podocarpic acid (all cis delta-5,11,14/20:3) was only 7% of that of arachidonic acid (all cis delta-5,8,11,14/20:4). From these results it was concluded that the condensing enzyme of FACES could recognize the methylene-interrupted cis double bond structure vicinal to the carboxyl group in the fatty acid molecule.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23988007>Synthesis of phytosteryl ester containing  in a solvent-free system using immobilized Candida rugosa lipase.</a></h2><p>Phytosteryl ester synthesized with  (PLA) from pine nut oil is expected to have features of both phytosterol and PLA. In this study, lipase from Candida rugosa (CRL) was immobilized and then used to optimize conditions for synthesis of phytosteryl ester containing PLA. Lewatit VP OC 1600, a macroporous hydrophobic resin, was selected as the best carrier, and the optimum condition for the immobilization of CRL was established. With immobilized CRL prepared, synthesis of phytosteryl ester with fatty acid from pine nut oil was carried out. Parameters investigated were temperature, molar ratio (phytosterol to fatty acid), enzyme loading, and vacuum. Optimum conditions for synthesis of phytosteryl ester were a temperature of 60 °C, molar ratio of 1:4, enzyme loading of 10% (based on the total weight of the substrate), and pressure of 80 kPa. The maximum conversion of phytosteryl ester was ca. 93 mol % at the optimum condition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23140571>Diet enriched with korean pine nut oil improves mitochondrial oxidative  in skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue in diet-induced obesity.</a></h2><p>In this study, we investigated effects of pine nut oil (PNO) on high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity and  dysfunction in skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue (BAT). Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a HFD with 15% energy from lard and 30% energy from either soybean oil (SBO-HFD) or PNO (PNO-HFD) for 12 weeks. The PNO-HFD resulted in less weight gain and intramuscular lipid accumulation than the SBO-HFD and was accompanied by upregulation of transcripts and proteins related to oxidative  and phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), as well as molecules selectively expressed in type I and type IIa muscle fibers. In addition, uncoupling protein-1 was upregulated in BAT. These beneficial  effects were partly associated with the dual ligand activity of , which is abundant in PNO, for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α and δ. Our findings suggest that PNO may have potential as a dietary supplement for counteracting obesity and  dysregulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27084371> Downregulates Lipid Anabolic Pathway in HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>Pine nut oil (PNO) was reported to reduce lipid accumulation in the liver. However, the specific effect of  (18:3, all-cis-Δ5,9,12), a unique component of PNO, on lipid  has not been studied. We hypothesized that  downregulates the lipid anabolic pathway in HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were incubated in serum-free medium supplemented with 50 μM bovine serum albumin (BSA), palmitic acid, oleic acid, γ-linolenic acid, , eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), or α-linolenic acid for 24 h. Lipid accumulation was determined by Oil Red O (ORO) staining. The mRNA levels of genes related to fatty acid biosynthesis (SREBP1c, FAS, SCD1, and ACC1), fatty acid oxidation (ACC2, PPARα, CPT1A, and ACADL), cholesterol synthesis (SREBP2 and HMGCR), and lipoprotein uptake (LDLr) and of genes that may be involved in the downregulation of the lipogenic pathway (ACSL3, ACSL4, and ACSL5) were determined by qPCR. LDLR protein levels were measured by Western blot analysis. The mRNA levels of SREBP1c, FAS, and SCD1 were significantly downregulated by  treatment compared to BSA control (53, 54, and 38 % lower, respectively). In addition, the mRNA levels of HMGCR, ACSL3, and LDLr were significantly lower (30, 30, and 43 % lower, respectively), and ACSL4 tended to be lower in the  group (20 % lower, P = 0.082) relative to the control group.

Analysis of the fatty acid composition of liver phosphatidylcholine indicated that, in contrast to alpha-linolenic acid,  does not interfere with the desaturation of linoleic acid to arachidonic acid. However, the effects on ADP-induced platelet aggregation and aortic prostacyclin production were comparable.

Incorporation of PNA and Δ7-ETrA into murine macrophages inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production. Due to the lack of availability of the naturally-occurring fatty acid, we synthesized Δ7-ETrA and demonstrated it was capable of suppressing PGE2 production. Using laboratory synthetic techniques involving 2-carbon elongation and argentated column chromatography, Δ7-ETrA was synthesized and isolated. Its identity and purity (>98%) were confirmed by gas chromatography (GC)/GC-mass spectroscopy. Incubation of murine RAW264.7 cells or rat primary peritoneal macrophages with Δ7-ETrA reduced PGE2 production by up to 84%, but slightly down-regulated type-2 cyclooxygenase (COX-2) expression. Δ7-ETrA blocked nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) translocation into nucleus and inactivated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), however, these results might not directly account for its inhibitory effect. Furthermore, PGE2 production reduced by Δ7-ETrA was highly correlated with the extent of Δ7-ETrA incorporation into cellular phospholipids and appeared to be the result of competition between this unusual fatty acid and arachidonic acid (AA) for COX-2. In conclusion, Δ7-ETrA incorporation suppresses PGE2 production by macrophages through competition between Δ7-ETrA and AA for COX-2.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Pine nut oil was hydrolyzed to provide a low--containing FA extract (LPAFAE), followed by crystallization with different ratios of urea in ethanol (EtOH) or methanol (MeOH) as a solvent to produce a high--containing FA extract (HPAFAE). The profiles of HPAFAE obtained by urea complexation showed different FA compositions compared with LPAFAE. The long-chain saturated FA palmitic acid (16:0) and stearic acid (18:0) were decreased with urea/FA ratios (UFR) of 1:1 (UFR1), 2:1 (UFR2), and 3:1 (UFR3). Linoleic acid (9,12-18:2) was increased 1.3 times with UFR2 in EtOH, and linolenic acid (9,12,15-18:3) was increased 1.5 times with UFR3 in MeOH after crystallization.

However, few studies have examined the biological effect of  (PNA; 5,9,12-18:3), the main fatty acid in pine seed oil. In this study, using murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells as a model, we examined the effect of PNA on polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) , prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. Results showed that PNA was readily taken up, incorporated and elongated to form eicosatrienoic acid (ETrA, 7,11,14-20:3) in macrophage cells. A small portion of this elongated metabolite was further elongated to form 9,13,16-22:3. The degree of incorporation of PNA and its metabolites into cellular phospholipids varied with the length of incubation time and the concentration of PNA in the medium. Incubation of PNA also modified the fatty acid profile of phospholipids: the levels of 18- and 20-carbon PUFA were significantly decreased, whereas those of 22-carbon fatty acids increased. This finding suggests that PNA enhances the elongation of 20-carbon fatty acids to 22-carbon fatty acids. The syntheses of PGE(1) from dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA, 8,11,14-20:4) and PGE(2) from arachidonic acid (ARA, 5,8,11,14-20:4) were also suppressed by the presence of PNA and its metabolite. As the expression of COX-2 was not suppressed, the inhibitory effect of PNA on PG activity was attributed in part to substrate competition between the PNA metabolite (i.e., 7,11,14-20:3) and DGLA (or ARA).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29424439>Divergent Response of Murine and Porcine Adipocytes to Stimulation of Browning Genes by 18-Carbon Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and Beta-Receptor Agonists.</a></h2><p>Long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) are known to activate brown and beige adipocytes.

Expression levels of thermoregulatory markers were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. LNA, ALA, GLA, and PLA upregulated Ucp1 expression and tended to upregulate Pgc1a expression in murine primary adipocytes, but not in 10T1/2, 3T3-L1, and porcine primary adipocytes. In murine primary adipocytes, NE induced a higher expression of Ucp1 and Pgc1a than non-NE-treated cells, and PLA augmented the NE effect. In 10T1/2 cells, NE upregulated Ucp1 and Pgc1a expression, but there was no fatty acid effect. However, 3T3-L1 cells were insensitive to both fatty acid and beta-adrenergic agonist stimulation. These results indicate that different adipocyte cell types have different levels of sensitivity to both LCFA and beta agonists in regard to induction of brown fat-specific gene expression.© 2018 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6099397>The non-eicosanoid functions of the essential fatty acids.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11171154>An unusual desaturase in Aquilegia vulgaris.</a></h2><p>Aquilegia vulgaris seed oil contains high levels of the rare fatty acid columbinic acid (18:3 Delta(5,9,12)), which is unusual in having the double bond at the Delta(5) carbon in the trans configuration.

In this study, we investigated the effects of supplementation of several polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on the AA concentration of the PI fraction using a cultured cell system. Neither alpha-linolenic acid nor eicosapentaenoic acid supplement reduced the level of AA in PI of HepG2 cells. In contrast to the n-3 series PUFAs, adding podocarpic acid (20:3, Delta-5,11,14) and  (18:3, Delta-5,9,12) reduced the AA content of the PI fraction from a control value of 15.9% to 7.0 and 8.7%, respectively. In the experiments with , selective and significant accumulation of 20:3 (Delta-7,11,14), the chain-elongated metabolite of , was observed in the PI fraction. On the other hand, adding columbinic acid (18:3, Delta-5t,9,12) had no effect on AA content of the PI fraction. Because both podocarpic acid and  are non-methylene-interrupted fatty acids (NMIFAs) that are not converted to AA metabolically, these NMIFAs may be interesting experimental tools for research on the function of PI-origin bioactive lipids.Copyright 1999 Academic Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16267098>A front-end desaturase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii produces pinolenic and coniferonic acids by omega13 desaturation in methylotrophic yeast and tobacco.</a></h2><p> (PA; 18:3Delta(5,9,12)) and coniferonic acid (CA; 18:4Delta(5,9,12,15)) are Delta(5)-unsaturated bis-methylene-interrupted fatty acids (Delta(5)-UBIFAs) commonly found in pine seed oil. They are assumed to be synthesized from linoleic acid (LA; 18:2Delta(9,12)) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3Delta(9,12,15)), respectively, by Delta(5)-desaturation. A unicellular green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii also accumulates PA and CA in a betain lipid. The expressed sequence tag (EST) resource of C. reinhardtii led to the isolation of a cDNA clone that encoded a putative fatty acid desaturase named as CrDES containing a cytochrome b5 domain at the N-terminus. When the coding sequence was expressed heterologously in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, PA and CA were newly detected and comparable amounts of LA and ALA were reduced, demonstrating that CrDES has Delta(5)-desaturase activity for both LA and ALA. CrDES expressed in the yeast showed Delta(5)-desaturase activity on 18:1Delta(9) but not 18:1Delta(11). Unexpectedly, CrDES also showed Delta(7)-desaturase activity on 20:2Delta(11,14) and 20:3Delta(11,14,17) to produce 20:3Delta(7,11,14) and 20:4Delta(7,11,14,17), respectively. Since both the Delta(5) bond in C18 and the Delta(7) bond in C20 fatty acids are 'omega13' double bonds, these results indicate that CrDES has omega13 desaturase activity for omega9 unsaturated C18/C20 fatty acids, in contrast to the previously reported front-end desaturases. In order to evaluate the activity of CrDES in higher plants, transgenic tobacco plants expressing CrDES were created. PA and CA accumulated in the leaves of transgenic plants. The highest combined yield of PA and CA was 44.7% of total fatty acids, suggesting that PA and CA can be produced in higher plants on a large scale.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2841074>Modulation of immunogenic keratitis in rabbits by topical administration of poly-unsaturated fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Several unsaturated fatty acids are precursors of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Depending on their precursor, these prostaglandins and leukotrienes have different biological characteristics. The effects of topically administered fatty acids on an experimentally provoked inflammatory keratitis were studied in rabbits. Intrastromal injection with human serum albumin induced in the cornea a ring-shaped infiltration with leukocytes, corneal edema and neovascularization. Arachidonic, gamma-linolenic, dihomo-gamma-linolenic (DHGL), eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and columbinic acid were given as eye drops in a suspension in hydroxypropylmethylcellulose 0.5% three times daily during the experiment. EPA, DHGL, columbinic, and gamma-linolenic, but not arachidonic acid, showed a significant inhibition of either leukocyte infiltration, edema or neovascularization. The inhibitory effects of these fatty acids may be caused by topical inhibition of the formation of prostaglandins and leukotrienes in the arachidonic acid cascade in the rabbit cornea.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21953622>Lipase-catalysed production of triacylglycerols enriched in  at the sn-2 position from pine nut oil.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to produce triacylglycerols (TAGs) enriched in  (PLA) at the sn-2 position using the principle of acyl migration, from the pine nut oil containing PLA esterified exclusively at the sn-3 position.Two types of lipase-catalysed reactions, i.e. redistribution and reesterification of fatty acids, were successively performed using seven commercially available lipases as biocatalysts. Of the lipases tested, Novozym 435 and Lipozyme TL IM were effective biocatalysts for positioning PLA at the sn-2 location. These biocatalysts were selected for further evaluation of the effects of reaction parameters, such as temperature and water content on the migration of PLA residues to the sn-2 position and TAG content. For both lipases, a significant decrease in TAG content was observed after the lipase-catalysed redistribution of fatty acids for both lipases. The reduced TAG content could be enhanced up to approx. 92%, through lipase-catalysed re-esterification of the hydrolysed fatty acids under vacuum.TAG enriched in PLA at the sn-2 position was synthesised from pine nut oil via lipase-catalysed redistribution and re-esterification of fatty acid residues using Lipozyme TL IM and Novozym 435 as biocatalysts.Copyright © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22753389>Synthesis of monoacylglycerol containing  via stepwise esterification using a cold active lipase.</a></h2><p>High purity monoacylglycerol (MAG) containing  was synthesized via stepwise esterification of glycerol and fatty acids from pine nut oil using a cold active lipase from Penicillium camembertii as a biocatalyst. Effects of temperature, molar ratio, water content, enzyme loading, and vacuum on the synthesis of MAG by lipase-catalyzed esterification of glycerol and fatty acid from pine nut oil were investigated. Diacylglycerol (DAG) as well as MAG increased significantly when temperature was increased from 20 to 40 °C. At a molar ratio of 1:1, MAG content decreased because of the significant increase in DAG content. Water has a profound influence on both MAG and DAG content through the entire course of reaction. The reaction rate increased significantly as enzyme loading increased up to 600 units. Vacuum was an effective method to reduce DAG content. The optimum temperature, molar ratio, water content, enzyme loading, vacuum, and reaction time were 20 °C, 1:5 (fatty acid to glycerol), 2%, 600 units, 5 torr, and 24 h, respectively.

As a major Delta-5 PUFA,  (Pi) is about 14.2% in the oil, while the percentage of Pi at the sn-1 and/or sn-3 positions in TAG was found more than 20%. In this current study, the enhancement of Pi at the sn-2 position has been achieved by acyl migration during the lipase-catalyzed inter-esterification between Pn and palm stearin (Ps). After reaction, the proportion of Pi increased at sn-2 positional fatty acid even is similar to that in total fatty acid; for example, in the inter-esterified product of 50:50 (Pn:Ps), the same amount of Pi (7.1%) present was detected both at the sn-2 and sn-1,3 positions.

Sciadonic acid (SciA, 20:3 Δ-5,11,14) and juniperonic acid (JA, 20:4 Δ-5,11,14,17) are typical C20 PMI-PUFA with an isolated double bond at Δ5. Previously, we found that SciA and JA are converted to linoleic acid (LNA) and α-linolenic acid (ΑLA), respectively. The conversion process includes chain-shortening step by peroxisomal β-oxidation for elimination a double bond at Δ5, and subsequent chain-elongation step in microsomes. In this study, we examined the substrate specificity of this  in rodent and human cells. Supplementation of SciA, eicosadienoic acid (EDA, 20:2 Δ-11,14) or JA to CHO-K1 cells (wild type) induced an accumulation of LNA, LNA or ALA, respectively, in cellular lipids. These changes were not observed in the peroxisomes-deficient CHO cells, indicating involvement of peroxisomes in the . Two types of human cells (MKN74 and HepG2) also converted the C20 PMI-PUFA and EDA to the respective essential fatty acids. In contrast, no chain-shortened metabolite of  (18:3 Δ-5,9,12) was detected in any cell lines tested. From these results, C20 PMI-PUFA and EDA, but not C18 PMI-PUFA, are suggested as being effectively converted to essential fatty acids by the fatty acid remodeling system in rodent and human cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3337831> of 6,9,12-octadecatrienoic acid and 6,9,12,15-octadecatetraenoic acid by rat hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>When 5.10(6) hepatocytes were incubated for 40 min with 0.015-0.3 mM (1-14C)-labeled 6,9,12-octadecatrienoic acid or (1-14C)-labeled 6,9,12,15-octadecatetraenoic acid there was a concentration-dependent acylation of radioactive metabolites into both phospholipids and triacylglycerol. However, when the concentration of either substrate exceeded 60-150 microM there was no further increase in the  of either substrate to longer-chain (n-6) and (n-3) acids. When cells were then incubated for various periods of time with 60 microM substrate there was initial rapid removal of the substrate which was accompanied by its acylation into lipids. Over time, the amount of both substrates in lipids declined without an overall drop in specific activity. This decline was accompanied by an increase in long-chain (n-6) and (n-3) fatty acids. Similar results were obtained when the time-dependent  of the two substrates was examined in individual hepatocyte phospholipids. Collectively, these findings suggest that when these two 18-carbon acids are produced by desaturation of dietary linoleate and linolenate that they are in part initially acylated into a labile phospholipid pool. Rapid release and subsequent further  to longer-chain (n-6) and (n-3) acids may explain why these products of the 6-desaturase do not accumulate in membrane lipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3632215>Effect of dietary columbinic acid on the fatty acid composition and physical membrane properties of different tissues of EFA-deficient rats.</a></h2><p>The effect of columbinic acid (5 trans, 9 cis, 12 cis, octadeca-trienoic acid) supplemented to a fat-free diet on the fatty acid composition and its correlation to the physical properties of several tissues of rats, was studied. The absence of lipids in the diet produced the typical changes in the fatty acid composition characteristic of essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency, namely a significant increase in the relative percentage of monoenoic fatty acids with a concomitant decrease in linoleic and arachidonic acids and a rise in eicosa-5,8,11-trienoic acid in liver, kidney, lung and spleen homogenates. Columbinic acid supplemented to a fat-free diet for 24 or 48 hr was incorporated into the different tissues and was partially elongated to 7 trans, 11 cis, 14 cis eicosatrienoic acid, but it was not desaturated. It modified the fatty acid spectrum of the lipids in the different tissues returning it to a similar composition of non-EFA deficient animals, except for a decrease of linoleic acid. The absence of lipids in the diet produced an increase in the 1-6 diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) steady-state fluorescence anisotropy (rs) in liver microsomes, that was corrected by the administration of columbinic acid for 24 hr. It is concluded that columbinic acid produced a change in the pattern of total fatty acid composition of the different tissues studied which induced a favorable effect on the physical properties of the liver microsomal membranes (rs), leading to an improvement on the fatty acid deficiency in those membranes. Besides, columbinic acid would also exert a favorable effect in the short term, but not in the long-term eicosanoids production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3080561>Urinary excretion of arginine-vasopressin and prostaglandin E2 in essential fatty acid-deficient rats after oral supplementation with unsaturated fatty acid esters.</a></h2><p>Essential fatty acid-deficient rats were supplemented with 300 mg/d of pure fatty acid esters: oleate (O), linoleate (L), arachidonate (A), and columbinate (C) for 10 d. The 24-h urine collections from each animal, collected 3 d before supplementations and again the last 3 d of the 10-d supplementation period, were analyzed for volume, and by radioimmunoassay for arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Linoleate and arachidonate supplements both decreased the initial high urinary AVP excretion, whereas it was further increased by the oleate supplement. There was no effect of columbinate supplementation on urinary AVP excretion. Urinary PGE2 excretion was increased ca. twofold by both linoleate and oleate supplements, increased ca. fivefold by arachidonate supplementation but was unaffected by columbinate supplementation. There was no effect of any of the supplemented fatty acids on urine output. Fatty acid analysis of total kidney lipids revealed a low percentage of 20:3(n-9) in the rats supplemented with (n-6) fatty acid (L, A and C). The triene-tetraene ratio was 1.8 +/- 0.6 (n = 6) in the kidneys of the oleate-supplemented rats. No relationship was found between urinary PGE2 excretion and the percentage of arachidonate or the ratio of 20:3 (n-9)/20:4(n-6) in total kidney lipids. It is suggested that increased urinary AVP excretion in EFA-deficient rats is mainly caused by a change in the renal excretatory mechanism of AVP rather than reflecting an increased plasma AVP concentration. Furthermore it is suggested that renal PGE2 synthesis in vivo is unaffected by high levels of 20:3(n-9) in kidney lipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20812372>Effects of postharvest treatments on fruit quality of sweet pepper at low temperature.</a></h2><p>Postharvest storage of sweet pepper fruits (Capsicum annuum L.) at low temperatures could impair their physical and chemical composition. Therefore, maintenance of essential nutrition support or altered gas exchange could preserve fruit quality, minimizing chilling injury. Thus our aim was to determine the response to postharvest application of a low concentration of nitrogen (urea) or antitranspirant (pinolene) during a period of 21 days at 5 °C.The results indicate that storage at 5 °C was effective with respect to maintaining firmness of sweet pepper fruits for 21 days, while application of antitranspirant increased firmness compared with non-sprayed fruits. Additionally, urea maintained color while increasing total phenolics and the activity of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase, lowering lipid peroxidation. Composition of free amino acids was affected to a minor extent.Maintaining quality is of paramount importance in the postharvest period. This study shows the effect of both temperature and spraying treatments with regard to maintaining fruit quality during this period, and provides new insights into the physiological role of enzymes of the antioxidant system during pepper storage at low temperature.Copyright © 2010 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28198188> in Structured Triacylglycerols Exhibits Superior Intestinal Lymphatic Absorption As Compared to  in Natural Pine Nut Oil.</a></h2><p>The positional distribution pattern of fatty acids (FAs) in the triacylglycerols (TAGs) affects intestinal absorption of these FAs.

The trienoic acids employed were 9,12,15-18:3 (alpha-18:3), 6,9,12-18:3 (gamma-18:3), and 5,9,12-18:3 ( which is a fatty acid contained in pine seed oil, po-18:3). The activities of microsomal glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase obtained with various 18:3 were only slightly lower than or comparable with those obtained with palmitic (16:0), oleic (18:1), and linoleic (18:2) acids. Mitochondrial glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase was exclusively specific for saturated fatty acyl-CoA. The activities of microsomal diacylglycerol acyltransferase measured with various polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs were significantly lower than those obtained with 16:0- and 18:1-CoAs. Among the polyunsaturated fatty acids, gamma-18:3 gave the distinctly low activity. The Vmax values of the mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase I were significantly higher with alpha-18:3 and po-18:3 but not gamma-18:3, than with 16:0 and 18:2, while the apparent Km values were the same irrespective of the types of acyl-CoA used except for the distinctly low value obtained with gamma-18:3. The response to an inhibitor of the acyltransferase reaction, malonyl-CoA, was appreciably exaggerated with 18:2, alpha-18:3, and po-18:3 more than with 16:0 and 18:1. However, the response with gamma-18:3 was the same as with 16:0. Thus, some of glycerolipid biosynthesis and fatty acid oxidation enzymes could discriminate not only the differences in the degree of unsaturation of fatty acids but also the positional distribution of double bond among the naturally occurring 18:3 acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3922424>Essential function of linoleic acid esterified in acylglucosylceramide and acylceramide in maintaining the epidermal water permeability barrier. Evidence from feeding studies with oleate, linoleate, arachidonate, columbinate and alpha-linolenate.</a></h2><p>Essential fatty acid-deficient rats were supplemented with 300 mg per day of pure fatty acid esters: oleate (O), linoleate (L), arachidonate (A), and columbinate (C) for 10 days. During this period, the rats in groups L, A, and C all showed a decrease in their initially high trans-epidermal water loss, a classical essential fatty acid-deficiency symptom, to a level seen in non-deficient rats (group N). The trans-epidermal water loss in rats of group O was unaffected by the supplementation. Fatty acid composition of two epidermal sphingolipids, acylglucosylceramide and acylceramide, from the skin were determined. The results indicate that re-establishment of a low trans-epidermal water loss was associated with incorporation of linolenate into the two epidermal sphingolipids. Supplementation with columbinate resulted in relatively high amounts of this fatty acid in the investigated epidermal sphingolipids. Analysis of pooled skin specimens from a previous study in which weanling rats were fed a fat-free diet and supplemented orally with pure alpha-linolenate for 13 weeks (Hansen, H.S. and Jensen, B. (1983) Lipids 18, 682-690) revealed very little polyunsaturated fatty acid in the two sphingolipids. These rats showed increased evaporation which was comparable to that of essential fatty acid-deficient rats. We interpret these results as strong evidence for a very specific and essential function of linoleic acid in maintaining the integrity of the epidermal water permeability barrier. This function of linoleate is independent of its role as precursor for arachidonate and icosanoids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30404964>Preparation of High Purity Δ5-Olefinic Acids from Pine Nut Oil via Repeated Lipase-Catalyzed Esterification.</a></h2><p>Δ5-Olefinic acids have been characterized in gymnosperm plants and have been reported to have several biological health benefits. Δ5-Olefinic acids from pine nut oil were effectively concentrated by repeated lipase-catalyzed esterification. The pine nut oil contained three major Δ5-olefinic acids, namely taxoleic acid (C18:2 Δ5,9),  (C18:3 Δ5,9,12), and sciadonic acid (C20:3 Δ5,11,14). The fatty acids present in pine nut oil were selectively esterified with ethanol using Lipozyme RM IM from Rhizomucor miehei as a biocatalyst. The Δ5-olefinic acids were concentrated in the unesterified fatty acid fraction. The optimum molar ratio of the substrates (fatty acid:ethanol), temperature, the enzyme loading, and the reaction time were 1:7, 25°C, 5% of total substrate weight, and 6 h, respectively. There was no significant effect in the concentration of Δ5-olefinic acids when water was added in the reaction mixture. The same protocol and optimum conditions were employed for two times repeated lipase-catalyzed esterifications. In first lipase-catalyzed esterification, the Δ5-olefinic acids content in the pine nut oil increased from 17 mol% to 51 mol% with a yield of 40 mol%. In a second lipase-catalyzed esterification, with the Δ5-olefinic acids-concentrated fatty acids obtained from the first reaction as the substrate, the Δ5-olefinic acids content increased to 86 mol% with a yield of 15 mol%.
