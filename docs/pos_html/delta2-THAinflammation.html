Examples are eculizumab (Soliris®), which is used clinically to block complement factor C5, as well as anti-human CD14 (r18D11) and anti-porcine CD14 (rMIL2) produced in our laboratory. So far, no proper IgG2/4 control antibody has been available for controlled validation of IgG2/4 antibody functions. Here, we describe the design of a recombinant control antibody (NHDL), which was generated by combining the variable light (V) and heavy (V) chains from two unrelated specificities. NHDL was readily expressed and purified as a stable IgG2/4 antibody, and showed no detectable specificity towards any putative antigen present in human or porcine blood. The approach of artificial V/V combination may be adopted for the design of other recombinant control antibodies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673484>Role of Complement Activation in Allograft .</a></h1><p>Novel paradigms have broadened our understanding of mechanisms through which complement mediates allograft /injury. Herein we review advances in the field and highlight therapeutic implications.Pre-clinical and translational human trials have elucidated complement-dependent mechanisms of post-transplant ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Immune cell-derived, and intracellular, complement activation are newly linked to proinflammatory T cell immunity relevant to allograft rejection. Complement-induced immune regulation, including C5a ligation of C5a receptor 2 on T cells, C5a/C5a receptor 1 interactions on regulatory myeloid cells, and C1q binding to CD8 T cells can inhibit proinflammatory T cells and/or prolong murine allograft survival. Pilot trials of complement inhibition to treat/prevent human I/R- or antibody-initiated allograft injury show promise.The complement system participates in allograft injury through multiple context- dependent mechanisms involving various components and receptors. These new insights along with development and implementation of individualized complement inhibitory strategies have potential to improve transplant outcomes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669609>Diastolic dysfunction is initiated by cardiomyocyte impairment ahead of endothelial dysfunction due to increased oxidative stress and  in an experimental prediabetes model.</a></h1><p>Coronary microvessel endothelial dysfunction and nitric oxide (NO) depletion contribute to elevated passive tension of cardiomyocytes, diastolic dysfunction and predispose the heart to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. We examined if diastolic dysfunction at the level of the cardiomyocytes precedes coronary endothelial dysfunction in prediabetes. Further, we determined if myofilaments other than titin contribute to impairment. Utilizing synchrotron microangiography we found young prediabetic male rats showed preserved dilator responses to acetylcholine in microvessels. Utilizing synchrotron X-ray diffraction we show that cardiac relaxation and cross-bridge dynamics are impaired by myosin head displacement from actin filaments particularly in the inner myocardium. We reveal that increased PKC activity and mitochondrial oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes contributes to rho-kinase mediated impairment of myosin head extension to actin filaments, depression of soluble guanylyl cyclase /PKG activity and consequently stiffening of titin in prediabetes ahead of coronary endothelial dysfunction.Copyright © 2019.

Despite an increasing amount of people worldwide developing NAFLD and having it progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and potentially cirrhosis, there is still no approved therapy. Therefore, huge efforts are being made to find and develop a successful treatment. One of the special interests is understanding the liver-gut axis and especially the role of bile acids in the progression of NAFLD. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-agonists have been approved und used in other liver diseases, such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and have shown signs of being able to decrease  and potentially steatosis. This review will mainly focus on targets/ligands that play an important role in bile acid metabolism and give an overview of ongoing clinical as well as pre-clinical trials. With the complexity of the issue, we did not aim at giving a complete review, rather highlighting important targets and potential treatments that could be approved for NAFLD/NASH treatment within the next few years.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671330>Obeticholic acid prevents carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis through interaction between farnesoid X receptor and Smad3.</a></h1><p>Liver fibrosis results from sustained liver injury and is characterized by , hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation, extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation and liver structure destruction. The Farnesoid-X receptor (FXR) antagonizes toxic liver injury and fibrosis, yet the mechanism in liver fibrosis remains unclear. We investigated the effects of FXR agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) on liver fibrosis in mice. Mice were injected with carbon tetrachloride (CCl) for 3 weeks or 6 weeks to induce liver fibrosis. OCA (5 mg/kg) or PBS is administered daily during CCl-treatment. At sacrifice, biochemical parameters and fibrosis were assessed. Pretreatment with OCA alleviated hepatic injury in 6 weeks group but not in 3 weeks group of CCl liver cirrhosis. At same time, pretreatment with OCA exhibit a dramatic protection of liver fibrosis in both 3 weeks group and 6 weeks group. Further experiments found that OCA pretreatment inhibited α-SMA expression and the activation of hepatic pSmad3 in 3 weeks group and 6 weeks group of CCl-induced liver cirrhosis. Moreover, OCA activated FXR nuclear translocation and increased the interaction between liver FXR and pSmad3. This led to the discovery of a novel role for FXR in regulating fibrosis through interaction with pSmad3. Our data suggest that CCl-induced liver fibrosis is protected by OCA through interaction between farnesoid X receptor and Smad3.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

MicroRNAs (miR) are critical biologic regulators that can downregulate gene expression by causing messenger RNA degradation or inhibition of translation. This study sought to expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the reduced inflammatory response after the administration of beta-blockade (BB) in our rodent trauma model.Male Sprague-Dawley rats aged 8 to 9 weeks were randomized to lung contusion, hemorrhagic shock with daily restraint stress (LCHS/CS) or LCHS/CS plus propranolol (LCHS/CS+BB). Restraint stress occurred 2 hours daily after LCHS. Propranolol (10 mg/kg) was given daily until day 7. Total RNA and miR were isolated from bone marrow and genome-wide miR expression patterns were assayed. Bone marrow cytokine expression was determined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction.LCHS/CS led to significantly increased bone marrow expression of interleukin (IL) 1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, nitric oxide, and plasma C-reactive protein. There were marked differences in expression of 45 miRs in the LCHS/CS+BB group compared with the LCHS/CS group when using a p value <0.001. Rno-miR-27a and miR-25 were upregulated 7- to 8-fold in the rodents who underwent LCHS/CS+BB compared with LCHS/CS alone, and this correlated with reduced bone marrow expression of IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, nitric oxide, and reduced plasma C-reactive protein in the LCHS/CS+BB group.The genomic and miR expression patterns in bone marrow after LCHS/CS differed significantly compared with rodents that received propranolol after LCHS/CS. The use of BB after severe trauma can help mitigate persistent  by upregulating Rno-miR-27a and miR-25 and reducing inflammatory cytokines in those who remain critically ill.Copyright © 2019 American College of Surgeons.

Similar to M2 microglia, N2 neutrophils contribute to resolution of  and may participate in neuroprotection. However, it remains unclear whether N2 neutrophils protect ischemic neurons and whether they are associated with long-term outcomes after transient cerebral ischemia in rats. The present study proved that N2 neutrophils protected against oxygen glucosedeprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R)-induced primary cortical neuron injury via brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tropomyosin-related kinase B (BDNF/TrkB) signaling. In addition, in vivo studies revealed that transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO)-induced injury exhibited spontaneous recovery over time in rats. Moreover, neutrophils could infiltrate the ipsilateral brain parenchyma from the periphery after transient cerebral ischemia. Pearson's correlation analysis indicated that the proportion of N2 neutrophils in ipsilateral brain parenchyma was negatively correlated with the number of degenerating neurons, modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS), brain water content and infarct volume, and positively correlated with the number of surviving neurons and grip strength. In summary, the present study shows that N2 neutrophils likely participate in spontaneous recovery after transient cerebral ischemia by inhibiting ischemic neuron damage in rats, which indicates that N2 neutrophils may represent promising therapeutic target for promoting recovery after ischemic stroke.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, cART does not completely restore health. Chronic immune activation and  persist in treated patients and have been described as predictors for clinical events and mortality in HIV-infected patients. Limited information is available on the impact of the various cART regimens on /immunoactivation. The aim of this work was to explore the impact of elvitegravir, dolutegravir, raltegravir (integrase strand transfer inhibitors, INSTIs) and atazanavir (protease inhibitor, PI) on several soluble markers of immune activation and  during the first year of effective combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART). We conducted an observational retrospective cohort study in HIV-infected cART-naïve patients who initiated an INSTI or atazanavir regimen between March 2015 and February 2016 and a serum sample was available at baseline, 6 and 12 months after initiation. We compared the trend of D-Dimer, TNF- α, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, CCL4/MIP1-β, CCL5/RANTES, s-CD14, s-CD163, hs-CRP levels among the 4 arms of treatment. Percentage of variation from baseline was also measured for all markers. A total of 36 patients were included. We observed heterogeneous modifications in  markers among arms. In particular, we noted that EVG have significant negative effect on s-CD14, hs-CRP, IL-6 and D-Dimer in respect to other INSTIs and this different effect occurs mainly during the first 6 months of cART. IL-7 values increased in the three arms with INSTIs (significantly only in EGV, 159.8%, p = 0.0003) and decreased significantly in patients on PI (-48.96%; p = 0.04) over the period. In conclusion, our results provide further data on changes of inflammatory marker levels, especially for the new INSTIs.

Since the exact link between intrathecal  and mechanisms of cortical pathology remains unknown, we aimed to investigate a detailed proteomic CSF profiling which is able to reflect cortical damage in early MS.We combined new proteomic method, TRIDENT, CSF analysis, and advanced 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in 64 MS patients at the time of diagnosis and 26 controls with other neurological disorders. MS patients were stratified according to cortical lesion (CL) load.We identified 227 proteins differently expressed between the patients with high and low CL load. These were mainly related to complement and coagulation cascade as well as to iron homeostasis pathway (30 and 6% of all identified proteins, respectively). Accordingly, in the CSF of MS patients with high CL load at diagnosis, significantly higher levels of sCD163 (P < 0.0001), free hemoglobin (Hb) (P < 0.05), haptoglobin (P < 0.0001), and fibrinogen (P < 0.01) were detected. By contrast, CSF levels of sCD14 were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in MS patients with low CL load. Furthermore, CSF levels of sCD163 positively correlated (P < 0.01) with CSF levels of neurofilament, fibrinogen, and B cell-related molecules, such as CXCL13, CXCL12, IL10, and BAFF.Intrathecal dysregulation of iron homeostasis and coagulation pathway as well as B-cell and monocyte activity are strictly correlated with cortical damage at early disease stages.© 2019 The Authors.

Although metformin is a well-known antidiabetic drug, it also confers protection against a series of diseases through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). However, whether metformin affects PM-induced adverse health effects has not been investigated. In this study, we exposed wild-type (WT) and AMPKα2 mice to PM every other day via intratracheal instillation for 4 weeks. After PM exposure, the AMPKα2 mice developed more severe lung injury and cardiac dysfunction than were developed in the WT mice; however the administration of metformin was effective in attenuating PM-induced lung injury and cardiac dysfunction in both the WT and AMPKα2 mice. In the PM-exposed mice, metformin treatment resulted in reduced systemic and pulmonary , preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, suppressed induction of pulmonary and myocardial fibrosis and oxidative stress, and increased levels of mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, pretreatment with metformin significantly attenuated PM-induced cell death and oxidative stress in control and AMPKα2-depleted BEAS-2B and H9C2 cells, and was associated with preserved expression of mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes. These data support the notion that metformin protects against PM-induced adverse health effects through a pathway that appears independent of AMPKα2. Our findings suggest that metformin may also be a novel drug for therapies that treat air pollution associated disease.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The most abundant source to isolate MSCs is adipose tissue. Currently, perirenal adipose tissue is rarely described as the source of MSCs. MSCs were isolated from perirenal adipose tissue (prASCs) from patients undergoing tumor nephrectomies, cultured and characterized by flow cytometry and their differentiation potential into adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteoblasts and epithelial cells. Furthermore, prASCs were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA) or a mixture of cytokines (cytomix). In addition, prASC susceptibility to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) was investigated. The expression of inflammatory readouts was estimated by qPCR and immunoassay. HCMV infection was analyzed by qPCR and immunostaining. Characterization of cultured prASCs shows the cells meet the criteria of MSCs and prASCs can undergo trilineage differentiation. Cultured prASCs can be induced to differentiate into epithelial cells, shown by cytokeratin 18 expression. Stimulation of prASCs with LPS or cytomix suggests the cells are capable of initiating an -like response upon stimulation with LPS or cytokines, whereas, LTA did not induce a significant effect on the readouts (ICAM-1, IL-6, TNFα, MCP-1 mRNA and IL-6 protein). HCMV broadly infects prASCs, showing a viral load dependent cytopathological effect (CPE). Our current study summarizes the isolation and culture of prASCs, clearly characterizes the cells, and demonstrates their immunomodulatory potential and high permissiveness for HCMV.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673056>Jagged1-mediated myeloid Notch1 signaling activates HSF1/Snail and controls NLRP3 inflammasome activation in liver inflammatory injury.</a></h1><p>Notch signaling plays important roles in the regulation of immune cell functioning during the inflammatory response. Activation of the innate immune signaling receptor NLRP3 promotes  in injured tissue. However, it remains unknown whether Jagged1 (JAG1)-mediated myeloid Notch1 signaling regulates NLRP3 function in acute liver injury. Here, we report that myeloid Notch1 signaling regulates the NLRP3-driven inflammatory response in ischemia/reperfusion (IR)-induced liver injury. In a mouse model of liver IR injury, Notch1-proficient (Notch1) mice receiving recombinant JAG1 showed a reduction in IR-induced liver injury and increased Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) expression, whereas myeloid-specific Notch1 knockout (Notch1) aggravated hepatocellular damage even with concomitant JAG1 treatment. Compared to JAG1-treated Notch1 controls, Notch1 mice showed diminished HSF1 and Snail activity but augmented NLRP3/caspase-1 activity in ischemic liver. The disruption of HSF1 reduced Snail activation and enhanced NLRP3 activation, while the adoptive transfer of HSF1-expressing macrophages to Notch1 mice augmented Snail activation and mitigated IR-triggered liver . Moreover, the knockdown of Snail in JAG1-treated Notch1 livers worsened hepatocellular functioning, reduced TRX1 expression and increased TXNIP/NLRP3 expression. Ablation of myeloid Notch1 or Snail increased ASK1 activation and hepatocellular apoptosis, whereas the activation of Snail increased TRX1 expression and reduced TXNIP, NLRP3/caspase-1, and ROS production. Our findings demonstrated that JAG1-mediated myeloid Notch1 signaling promotes HSF1 and Snail activation, which in turn inhibits NLRP3 function and hepatocellular apoptosis leading to the alleviation of IR-induced liver injury. Hence, the Notch1/HSF1/Snail signaling axis represents a novel regulator of and a potential therapeutic target for liver inflammatory injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672572>Biglycan and atherosclerosis: Lessons from high cardiovascular risk conditions.</a></h1><p>Atherosclerosis (ATH) is a chronic, dynamic, evolutive process involving morphological and structural subversion of artery walls, leading to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. ATH generally initiates during the childhood, occurring as a result of a number of changes in the intima tunica and in the media of arteries. A key event occurring during the pathobiology of ATH is the accumulation of lipoproteins in the sub-intimal spaces mediated by extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules, especially by the chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate (CS/DS) -containing proteoglycans (CS/DSPGs). Among them, the proteoglycan biglycan (BGN) is critically involved in the onset and progression of ATH and evidences show that BGN represents the missing link between the pro-atherogenic status induced by both traditional and non-traditional cardiovascular risk factors and the development and progression of vascular damage. In the light of these findings, the role of BGN in dyslipidemia, hypertension, cigarette smoking, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and inflammatory status is briefly analyzed and discussed in order to shed new light on the underlying mechanisms governing the association between BGN and ATH.Copyright © 2019.

Inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion are implicated in myocardial infarction (MI) and resultant heart failure; however, little is known about how macrophage lysosomes regulate these processes. In mice subjected to cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury and humans with ischemic cardiomyopathy, we observed evidence of lysosomal impairment in macrophages. Inducible macrophage-specific overexpression of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis (Mϕ-TFEB), attenuated postinfarction remodeling, decreased abundance of proinflammatory macrophages, and reduced levels of myocardial IL-1β compared with controls. Surprisingly, neither inflammasome suppression nor Mϕ-TFEB-mediated attenuation of postinfarction myocardial dysfunction required intact ATG5-dependent macroautophagy (hereafter termed "autophagy"). RNA-seq of flow-sorted macrophages postinfarction revealed that Mϕ-TFEB upregulated key targets involved in lysosomal lipid metabolism. Specifically, inhibition of the TFEB target, lysosomal acid lipase, in vivo abrogated the beneficial effect of Mϕ-TFEB on postinfarction ventricular function. Thus, TFEB reprograms macrophage lysosomal lipid metabolism to attenuate remodeling after IR, suggesting an alternative paradigm whereby lysosome function affects .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671079>Maresin-1 Inhibits Oxidative Stress and  and Promotes Apoptosis in a Mouse Model of Caerulein-Induced Acute Pancreatitis.</a></h1><p>BACKGROUND This study aimed to investigate the effects of maresin-1 (MaR1) in a mouse model of caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis (AP). MATERIAL AND METHODS Fifty C57BL/6 mice with caerulein-induced AP were divided into the untreated control group (N=10), the untreated AP model group (N=10), the MaR1-treated (low-dose, 0.1 μg) AP model group (N=10), the MaR1-treated (middle-dose, 0.5 μg) AP model group (N=10), and the MaR1-treated (high-dose, 1 μg) AP model group (N=10). Enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) measured serum levels of amylase, lipase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), and IL-6 and mRNA was measured by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyls, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and the ratio of reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) were measured. Histology of the pancreas included measurement of acinar cell apoptosis using the terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay. Western blot measured Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), MyD88, and phospho-NF-kappaB p65, and apoptosis-associated proteins Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-9. RESULTS Following treatment with MaR1, serum levels of amylase, lipase, TNF-alpha, IL-1ß, and IL-6 decreased, MDA and protein carbonyl levels decreased, SOD and the GSH/GSSG ratio increased in a dose-dependent manner. In the MaR1-treated AP mice,  of the pancreas and the expression of inflammatory cytokines, pancreatic acinar cell apoptosis, Bcl-2 expression, and expression of TLR4, MyD88, and p-NF-kappaB p65 were reduced, but Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-9 expression increased.

In this article, we review the current state of knowledge and findings of studies investigating the cardiovascular effects of PM in rats and mice. The six main areas covered in this review include: I) nature of particulate matter and toxicity mechanisms, II) systemic , III) heart rate and heart rate variability, IV) histopathological effects, V) atherosclerosis, VI) thrombosis, and VI) myocardial infarction. This review showed that animal model studies have been successful to bring new insights into the mechanisms underlying PM-induced cardiovascular diseases. However, there are some areas that the exact mechanisms are still unclear. In conclusion, investigating the cardiovascular effects of PM in vivo or interpreting the results should attempt to justify the role of different PM compositions, which may vastly affect the overall cytotoxicity of particles.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In an effort to repurpose FDA-approved drugs against antibiotic-resistant bacteria, we identified auranofin as a potent drug against VRE. The present study determined that auranofin's antibacterial activity was not affected when evaluated against a higher inoculum size of VRE (∼10 CFU/mL), and auranofin successfully reduced the burden of stationary phase VRE cells via a time-kill assay. In addition, auranofin reduced VRE production of key virulence factors including proteases, lipase and hemagglutinin. The promising features of auranofin prompted us to evaluate its in vivo efficacy in a lethal mouse model of VRE septicemia. All mice receiving auranofin at 0.125 mg/kg orally, 0.125 mg/kg subcutaneously (S.C.), or 0.0625 mg/kg (S.C.) survived the lethal VRE challenge. Additionally, auranofin was superior to linezolid, the current drug of choice, in reducing VRE burden in the liver, kidneys and spleen of mice. Remarkably, auranofin successfully reduced VRE below the limit of detection in murine internal organs after only four days of oral or subcutaneous treatment. These results indicate that auranofin warrants further investigation as a new treatment for systemic VRE infections.Copyright © 2019.

Radiographic damage was assessed by the modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spinal Score (mSASSS). A change of 2 mSASSS units in 2 years was defined as progression. The characteristics of the study group such as demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment history were collected.There were 350 patients in the study. The mean mSASSS increased from 9.3 (15.8) units at baseline to 17.7 (21.7) units by the 6th year. Change in mSASSS scores between the 0 to 2, 2 to 4 and 4 to 6 years were 1.23 (2.68), 1.47 (2.86), and 1.52 (3.7) units respectively. Overall 24.3% of the group progressed in 2 years' time. Male sex (HR 2.46, 95%CI 1.05, 5.76), presence of baseline damage (HR 7.98, 95%CI 3.98, 16), increased inflammatory markers (logCRP; HR 1.35, 95%CI 1.07, 1.70) and TNFi use (HR 0.82, 95%CI 0.70, 0.96) were predictive of radiographic progression. There was a 20% reduction in the rate of progression with TNFi.Male sex, presence of baseline damage, active disease state and higher inflammatory markers confer a high-risk group for disease progression.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumor-suppressive function of 15-PGDH remain largely unresolved. In this study, we found that 15-keto PGE upregulated the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a representative antioxidative and anti-inflammatory enzyme, at both transcriptional and translational levels in human colon epithelial CCD 841 CoN cells. A redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) plays a critical role in the regulation of HO-1 and other cytoprotective proteins. 15-Keto PGE induced translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus and antioxidant response element-driven luciferase activity. Furthermore, the silencing of the Nrf2 gene abolished 15-keto PGE-induced HO-1 expression in CCD 841 CoN cells. 15-Keto PGE activated AKT signaling, and the pharmacological AKT inhibitor, LY294002 suppressed the 15-keto PGE-induced HO-1 expression. 15-Keto PGE generates the reactive oxygen species which is suppressed by the general antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine. N-acetyl-l-cysteine treatment attenuated the 15-keto PGE-induced phosphorylation of GSK3β, transcriptional activity of Nrf2, and subsequently HO-1 expression. However, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGE lacking the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety failed to induce reactive oxygen species, HO-1 expression and nuclear translocation of Nrf2. In conclusion, 15-keto PGE induces HO-1 expression through Nrf2 activation in human colon epithelial cells.Copyright © 2019.

Since global reports reflect a higher hypertension prevalence in black than white populations, we hypothesise the involvement of specific inflammatory mediators. We therefore compared a detailed range of 22 inflammatory mediators between young black and white adults, and determined the relationship with blood pressure.We included 1197 adults (20-30 years; 50% black; 52% female) with detailed ambulatory blood pressures. Blood samples were analysed for 22 inflammatory mediators. For pro-inflammatory mediators, the black adults had higher C-reactive protein, interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant, macrophage inflammatory protein 3 alpha (all p ≤ 0.008), but lower interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-8, IL-12, IL-17A, and tumour necrosis factor alpha (all p ≤ 0.048). For anti-inflammatory mediators the black group consistently had lower levels (IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13 (all p ≤ 0.012)), resulting in generally higher pro-to-anti-inflammatory ratios in black than white adults (p ≤ 0.001). In mediators with pro- and anti-inflammatory functions, the black group had lower granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and IL-6 (both p ≤ 0.010). These patterns were confirmed after adjustment for age, sex and waist circumference, or when stratifying by hypertensive status, sex and socio-economic status. Multi-variable adjusted regression analyses and factor analysis yielded no relationship between inflammatory mediators and blood pressure in this young healthy population.Black and white ethnic groups each consistently presented with unique inflammatory mediator patterns regardless of blood pressure, sex or social class. No association with blood pressure was seen in either of the groups.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been shown that the sequestration of the parasite infected red blood cells that interact with cerebral vessel endothelial cells and the damage of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) play critical roles in the pathogenesis. In this study, we developed a ferritin nanozyme (Fenozyme) composed of recombinant human ferritin (HFn) protein shells that specifically target to BBB endothelial cells (BBB ECs), and inner Fe3O4 nanozyme core that exhibits reactive oxygen species-scavenging catalase-like activity. In the experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) mouse model, administration of the Fenozyme, but not HFn, markedly ameliorated the damage of BBB induced by the parasite and improved the survival rate of infected mice significantly. Further investigations found that Fenozyme, as well as HFn, was able to polarize the macrophages in liver to M1 phenotype and promote the elimination of malaria in the blood. Thus, the catalase-like activity of the Fenozyme is required for its therapeutic effect in the mouse model. Moreover, the Fenozyme significantly alleviated the brain  and memory impairment in ECM mice that had been treated with artemether, indicating that combining Fenozyme with anti-malaria drug is a novel strategy for the treatment of cerebral malaria.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674896> products subvert the -induced inflammatory response in airway epithelial cells.</a></h1><p> This study aims to investigate the differences in host responses to mono- and co-infection with  and  in human airway epithelial cells.

Mammals have only one member, TRPA1, which is widely expressed in sensory neurons and in non-neuronal cells (such as epithelial cells and hair cells). TRPA1 owes its name to the presence of 14 ankyrin repeats located in the N-terminus of the channel, an unusual structural feature that may be relevant to its interactions with intracellular components. TRPA1 is primarily involved in the detection of an extremely wide variety of exogenous stimuli that may produce cellular damage. This include a plethora of electrophilic compounds that interact with nucleophilic amino acid residues in the channel, and many other chemically-unrelated compounds whose only common feature seems to be their ability to partition in the plasma membrane. TRPA1 has been reported to be activated by cold, heat and mechanical stimuli, and its function is modulated by multiple factors, including Ca, trace metals, pH, and reactive oxygen, nitrogen and carbonyl species. TRPA1 is involved in acute and chronic pain, , plays a role in the pathophysiology of nearly all organ systems and is an attractive target for the treatment of related diseases. Here we review the current knowledge about the mammalian TRPA1 channel, linking its unique structure, widely tuned sensory properties and complex regulation to its roles in multiple pathophysiological conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669425>Risk factors for Cutibacterium acnes spinal implant-associated infection: a case-case-control study.</a></h1><p>To determine the characteristics of patients who developed Cutibacterium acnes spinal implant-associated infection (SIAI) and the associated risk factors.We conducted two parallel case-control studies comparing 59 patients with SIAI caused by C. acnes (cases 1) and 93 patients with SIAI caused by other microorganisms (cases 2) diagnosed during 2010-2015 with 302 controls who underwent spinal instrumentation without subsequent infection.Late-onset infections (median time to diagnosis, 843 days versus 23 days; p<0.001) were more common in cases 1 than in cases 2. However, 20/59 (34%) of cases 1 occurred within the first three months after the index surgery. In addition, cases 1 were less likely to have fever (27%, 16/59 versus 58%, 54/93; p=0.001) or wound  (39%, 23/59 versus 72%, 67/93; p<0.001). Moreover, 24/59 (40%) of cases 1 presented with polymicrobial infections, and staphylococcal pathogens accounted for 22/24 (92%) of the co-infections. By comparing and contrasting the two multivariate risk models (cases 1 versus controls and cases 2 versus controls), the following factors associated with C. acnes SIAI development were identified: age <54 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-5.58, p=0.03), a body mass index <22 kg/m (aOR: 2.47, 95% CI: 1.17-5.29, p=0.02), and thoracic instrumentation (aOR: 16.1, 95% CI: 7.57-37.0, p<0.001) CONCLUSIONS: Future therapeutic and prophylactic studies on C. acnes SIAI should focus on young, thin patients who undergo spinal instrumentation procedures involving the thoracic spine.Copyright © 2019 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

Cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase and type-2 NADH dehydrogenase (NDH-2) are respiratory chain components predicted to be essential, and are currently targeted for drug development. Here we demonstrate that an Mtb cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase deletion mutant is viable and only partially attenuated in mice. Moreover, treatment of Mtb-infected marmosets with a cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase inhibitor controls disease progression and reduces lesion-associated , but most lesions become cavitary. Deletion of both NDH-2 encoding genes (Δndh-2 mutant) reveals that the essentiality of NDH-2 as shown in standard growth media is due to the presence of fatty acids. The Δndh-2 mutant is only mildly attenuated in mice and not differently susceptible to clofazimine, a drug in clinical use proposed to engage NDH-2. These results demonstrate the intrinsic plasticity of Mtb's respiratory chain, and highlight the challenges associated with targeting the pathogen's respiratory enzymes for tuberculosis drug development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674689>Akkermansia muciniphila reduces Porphyromonas gingivalis-induced  and periodontal bone destruction.</a></h1><p>Akkermansia muciniphila is a beneficial gut commensal, whose anti-inflammatory properties have recently been demonstrated.

Bone destruction and  were evaluated by histomorphometric analysis. In vitro, A.muciniphila was co-cultured with P.gingivalis, growth and virulence factors expression were evaluated. Bone-marrow macrophages (BMMϕ) and gingival epithelial cells (TIGK) were exposed to both bacterial strains and the expression of inflammatory mediators, as well as tight junction markers was analyzed.In a model of calvarial infection, A.muciniphila decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and bone destruction. In EIP, treatment with A.muciniphila resulted in a decreased alveolar bone loss. In vitro, the addition of A.muciniphila to P.gingivalis infected BMMϕ increased anti-inflammatory IL-10 and decreased IL-12. Additionally, A.muciniphila exposure increases the expression of junctional integrity markers such as integrin-β1, E-cadherin and ZO-1 in TIGK cells. A.muciniphila co-culture with P.gingivalis reduced gingipains mRNA expression.This study demonstrated the protective effects of A.muciniphila administration and may open consideration to its use as an adjunctive therapeutic agent to periodontal treatment.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Observational studies suggest that injectable hormonal contraceptives (HC) increase HIV risk, although their effects on genital , particularly HIV-susceptible Th17 cells, are unknown. In a randomized cross-over study, the effect of injectable norethisterone oenanthate (NET-EN), combined contraceptive vaginal rings (CCVR; NuvaRing®), and combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) on cervical Th17 cells and cytokines were compared.Adolescents (n=130; 15-19 years), randomized 1:1:1 to NET-EN, CCVR, or COCPs for 16-weeks, subsequently crossed-over to another HC for 16-weeks. Estrogen (E2), follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) were measured. CCR5, HLA-DR and CD38 expression by cervical cytobrush-derived CD4+ T cells was assessed by FACS. Th17 cells were defined as CCR6+CCR10-. Cervicovaginal Th17-related cytokines were measured by Luminex.CCVR use for the first 16-weeks was associated with reduced Th17 frequencies and lower FHS and LH concentrations compared to NET-EN/COCPs, with FHS concentrations and Th17 frequencies correlating significantly. However, Th17-related cytokine concentrations (IL-21, IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-γ) and CCR5+HLA-DR+CD38+ Th17 frequencies were significantly higher in CCVR than NET-EN/COCP. At cross-over, CCVR users changing to COCPs or NET-EN did not resolve activation or cytokines, although switching from COCP to CCVRs increased cytokine concentrations.CCVR use altered endogenous hormone levels and associated cervical Th17 cell frequencies to greater extent than NET-EN/COCPs, although Th17 cells were more activated and Th17-related cytokine concentrations were elevated. While CCVRs may impact HIV risk by regulating Th17 numbers, increased activation/ may balance any risk gains.© The Author(s) 2019.

We investigated the prevalence and correlates of UTI in a large cohort of patients with schizophrenia.We estimated the prevalence of UTI at the baseline visit of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) schizophrenia trial. We then investigated associations between UTI and inflammatory markers, psychopathology, and cognition, controlling for potential confounding factors.The prevalence of probable UTI at baseline in the CATIE trial was 1.2% (n = 13 of 1,061 participants). Compared with participants with a normal urinalysis (n = 387), after controlling for potential confounders, UTI was a significant predictor of greater impairments (approximately 1 standard deviation difference) in the cognition composite score (beta = -0.153, P = .002), and poorer working memory (beta = -0.190, P < .001). There were no differences in psychopathology scores between participants with probable UTI and those with a normal urinalysis.Urinary tract infections in patients with schizophrenia may have an impact on cognition.

Increased sympathetic drive is a hallmark of HF and is associated with disease progression and higher mortality risk. Several mechanisms contribute to enhanced sympathetic activity in HF, however these pathways are still incompletely understood. Previous work suggests that  and activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) increases sympathetic drive. Importantly, chronic  in several brain regions is commonly observed in aged populations, and a growing body of evidence suggests neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in HF. In animal models of HF, central inhibition of RAS and pro-inflammatory cytokines normalizes sympathetic drive and improves cardiac function. The precise molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to neuroinflammation and its effect on HF progression remain undetermined. This review will summarize the most recent advances in the field of neuroinflammation and autonomic control in HF. In addition, we will focus on cellular and molecular mediators of neuroinflammation in HF with a focus on brain regions involved in sympathetic control. Finally, we will comment on what is known about neuroinflammation in the context of preserved vs. reduced ejection fraction HF. Integrative physiology of heart failure progression: Heart failure (HF) is characterized by chronic , Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS) overactivity, sympathoexcitation, and cardiac dysfunction. Sympathoexcitation and RAS activation occur early in HF progression as a compensatory response to hemodynamic challenges. Chronic activation of these compensatory mechanisms becomes maladaptive and has toxic effects on cardiac muscle leading to electrophysiological abnormalities and initiation of fibrotic processes. RAS activation also enhances chemoreflex sensitivity (further exacerbating sympathetic activation) and promotes diffuse . Both systemic and brain RAS and  feeds back to exacerbate sympathoexcitation, generating a vicious cycle that contributes to further cardiac dysfunction.2 This article is protected by copyright.

Although HT is the most common cause of hypothyroidism, the pathogenesis of this disease is not fully understood. Glycosylation of serum proteins was examined in HT only to a limited extent. The study was designed to determine the glycosylation pattern of IgG-depleted sera from HT patients.Serum N-glycans released by N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) digestion were analyzed by normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (NP-HPLC). N-glycan structures in each collected HPLC fraction were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and exoglycosidase digestion. Fucosylation and sialylation was also analyzed by lectin blotting.The results showed an increase of monosialylated tri-antennary structure (A3G3S1) and disialylated diantennary N-glycan with antennary fucose (FA2G2S2). Subsequently, we analyzed the serum N-glycan profile by lectin blotting using lectins specific for fucose and sialic acid. We found a significant decrease of Lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA) staining in HT samples, which resulted from the reduction of α1,6-linked core fucose in HT serum. We also observed an increase of Maackia amurensis II lectin (MAL-II) reaction in HT due to the elevated level of α2,3-sialylation in HT sera.The detected alterations of serum protein sialylation might be caused by chronic  in HT. The obtained results completed our previous IgG N-glycosylation analysis in autoimmune thyroid patients and showed that the altered N-glycosylation of serum proteins is characteristic for autoimmunity process in HT.Thyroid autoimmunity is accompanied by changes of serum protein sialylation.Copyright © 2019.

We hypothesize that mTORC1 suppression may have dual effects on  and neuronal apoptosis and may be a feasible approach for SCI therapy. In this study, we evaluate a novel inhibitor of mTORC1 signalling, Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that AS-IV may suppress mTORC1 signalling both in neuronal cells and microglial cells in vitro and in vivo. AS-IV treatment may stimulate autophagy in neuronal cells and protect them against apoptosis through autophagy regulation; it may also promote M2 polarization in microglial cells and attenuate neuroinflammation. In vivo, rats were intraperitoneally injected with AS-IV (10 mg/kg/d) after SCI, behavioural and histological evaluations showed that AS-IV may promote functional recovery in rats after SCI. We propose that mTORC1 suppression may attenuate both microglial inflammatory response and neuronal apoptosis and promote functional recovery after SCI, while AS-IV may become a novel therapeutic medicine for SCI.© 2019 The Authors.

We have recently shown 30-d exposure to increased inspired CO (InCO) leads to a steady-state ventilation that exceeds the level predicted by the sustained acidosis and the acute CO/H chemoreflex, suggesting plasticity within respiratory control centers. Based on data showing brainstem changes in aminergic and inflammatory signaling during carotid body denervation-induced hypercapnia, we hypothesized chronic hypercapnia  will lead to similar changes. We found that: ) increased InCO increased IL-1β in the medullary raphe (MR), ventral respiratory column, and cuneate nucleus after 24 h, but not after 30 d of hypercapnia; ) the number of serotonergic and total neurons were reduced within the MR and ventrolateral medulla following 30 d of increased InCO; ) markers of tryptophan metabolism were altered following 24 h, but not 30 d of InCO; and ) there were few changes in brainstem amine levels following 24 h or 30 d of increased InCO. We conclude that these changes may contribute to initiating or maintaining respiratory neuroplasticity during chronic hypercapnia but alone do not account for ventilatory acclimatization to chronic increased InCO.-Burgraff, N.

Possible reasons for the NAFLD epidemic in industrialized countries are the high intake of pro-inflammatory n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 PUFAs) and low consumption of healthy n-3 PUFAs. Due to their anti-inflammatory properties, n-3 PUFAs may have the potential to alleviate chronic liver disease. Herein, we examined the therapeutic effect of increased n-3 PUFA tissue levels in fat-1 transgenic mice on progressive NASH.Disease was induced in mice by streptozotocin and high fat diet (STZ/HFD) resulting in NASH. NAFLD in 6 and 8 weeks old wild type and fat-1 transgenic STZ/HFD treated mice was analyzed. Unlike all other mammals, fat-1 transgenic mice ubiquitously express an n-3 fatty acid desaturase, which converts n-6 to n-3 PUFAs, leading to increased n-3 and decreased n-6 PUFA tissue contents.Liver damage, NAFLD activity score (NAS), hepatic lipid accumulation and  were significantly reduced in fat-1 transgenic STZ/HFD treated mice in the early (6 weeks) but not late (8 weeks) phase of NASH. Simultaneously, mRNA expression of genes involved in fatty acid uptake and storage ( and , respectively) was significantly down-regulated in 6 week old but not 8 week old fat-1 transgenic STZ/HFD treated mice.Endogenously elevated n-3 PUFA levels in fat-1 transgenic mice transiently delay the onset of STZ/HFD induced NASH but failed to efficiently protect from NASH development.2019 Hepatobiliary Surgery and Nutrition.

Surgeons use a variety of subjective and objective measures to evaluate flap perfusion postoperatively. However, these measures have some limitations. We have developed a wireless, biodegradable, and flexible sensor that can be applied to real-time postoperative free flap monitoring. Here we assess the biocompatibility and function of our novel sensor. Seven Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used for biocompatibility studies. The sensor was implanted around the femoral artery near the inguinal ligament on one leg (implant side) and sham surgery was performed on the contralateral leg (control side). At 6 and 12 weeks, samples were harvested to assess the  within and around the implant and artery. Two animals were used to assess sensor function. Sensor function was evaluated at implantation and 7 days after the implantation. Signal changes after venous occlusion were also assessed in an epigastric artery island flap model. In biocompatibility studies, the diameter of the arterial lumen and intima thickness in the implant group were not significantly different than the control group at the 12-week time point. The number of CD-68 positive cells that infiltrated into the soft tissue, surrounding the femoral artery, was also not significantly different between groups at the 12-week time point. For sensor function, accurate signaling could be recorded at implantation and 7 days later. A change in arterial signal was noted immediately after venous occlusion in a flap model. The novel wireless, biodegradable sensor presented here is biocompatible and capable of detecting arterial blood flow and venous occlusion with high sensitivity. This promising new technology could combat the complications of wired sensors, while improving the survival rate of flaps with vessel compromise due to its responsive nature.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669424>EFFECTS OF PHONOPHORESIS WITH IBUPROFEN ASSOCIATED WITH GOLD NANOPARTICLES IN ANIMAL MODEL OF TRAUMATIC MUSCLE INJURY.</a></h1><p>The repair process consists of molecular and cellular events that can be accelerated by specific therapies.

All cross-sectional and review articles about herbal treatment of mastalgia until 2018 November were studied.Nineteen articles from all of the available articles (45 cases) and a sample size about of (1987 cases) were included in our study. The articles were clinical trials. The results revealed that mastalgia could be healed by Nigella sativa, Vitex agnus-castus, curcumin, Hypericum perforatum, Citrus sinensis, wheat germ, and Ginkgo biloba.Most of the evaluated medicinal plants possessing antioxidant compounds with anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, exhibited healing effects in the treatment of mastalgia. Thus, medicinal plants can be considered in the treatment of mastalgia; however, further investigations are needed to obtain more details about their probable side effects.© 2019 Korean Pharmacopuncture Institute.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671645>Meta-Analysis of Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis Microarray Data Reveals Novel Genetic Biomarkers.</a></h1><p>Polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) are both classified as idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. They share a few common characteristics such as  and muscle weakness. Previous studies have indicated that these diseases present aspects of an auto-immune disorder; however, their exact pathogenesis is still unclear. In this study, three gene expression datasets (PM: 7, DM: 50, Control: 13) available in public databases were used to conduct meta-analysis. We then conducted expression quantitative trait loci analysis to detect the variant sites that may contribute to the pathogenesis of PM and DM. Six-hundred differentially expressed genes were identified in the meta-analysis (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.01), among which 317 genes were up-regulated and 283 were down-regulated in the disease group compared with those in the healthy control group. The up-regulated genes were significantly enriched in interferon-signaling pathways in protein secretion, and/or in unfolded-protein response. We detected 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which could potentially play key roles in driving the PM and DM. Along with previously reported genes, we identified 4 novel genes and 10 SNP-variant regions which could be used as candidates for potential drug targets or biomarkers for PM and DM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674729>Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) for Neuroscience Drug Discovery and Development: Current Status, Opportunities and Challenges.</a></h1><p>The substantial progress made in basic sciences of the brain has yet to be adequately translated to successful clinical therapeutics to treat central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Possible explanations include the lack of quantitative and validated biomarkers, the subjective nature of many clinical endpoints, and complex pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships, but also the possibility that highly selective drugs in the CNS do not reflect the complex interactions of different brain circuits. While computational systems pharmacology modeling designed to capture essential components of complex biological systems has been increasingly accepted in pharmaceutical Research & Development (R&D) for oncology, , and metabolic disorders, the uptake in the CNS field has been very modest. In this paper, a cross-disciplinary group with representatives from academia, pharma, regulatory and funding agencies make the case that the identification and exploitation of CNS therapeutic targets for drug discovery and development can benefit greatly from a system and network approach that can span the gap between molecular pathways and the neuronal circuits that ultimately regulate brain activity and behavior. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), in collaboration with the National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), convened a workshop to explore and evaluate the potential of a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) approach to CNS drug discovery and development. The objective of the workshop was to identify the challenges and opportunities of QSP as an approach to accelerate drug discovery and development in the field of CNS disorders. In particular, the workshop examined the potential for computational neuroscience to perform QSP-based interrogation of the mechanism of action for CNS diseases, along with a more accurate and comprehensive method for evaluating drug effects and optimizing the design of clinical trials. Following up on an earlier white paper on the use of QSP in general disease mechanism of action and drug discovery, this report focuses on new applications, opportunities and the accompanying limitations of QSP as an approach to drug development in the CNS therapeutic area, based on the discussions in the workshop with various stakeholders.© 2019 The Authors CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of the American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673046>Placental gene expression and antibody levels of mother-neonate pairs reveal an enhanced risk for  in a helminth endemic country.</a></h1><p>In utero exposure to environmental factors can modify the development of allergies later in life whereby the mechanisms of the feto-maternal crosstalk still remain largely unknown. Murine studies revealed that inflammatory maternal signals elicited by chronic helminth infection within the placenta imprint a distinct gene expression profile related to the Vitamin-D-receptor (VDR)--axis. We thus investigated whether pro- or anti- inflammatory immune responses as well as VDR and related gene expression within the placenta differ between women from helminth-endemic and non-endemic areas. A prospective pilot study was conducted in Munich, Germany (helminth non-endemic) and Lambaréné, Gabon (helminth-endemic). At delivery, clinical information alongside placenta tissue samples and maternal and cord blood were obtained for further laboratory analysis. Schistosoma haematobium infection was detected in 13/54 (23%) Gabonese women. RT PCR revealed significantly lower gene expression of VDR, Cyp27b1, Foxp3 and IL10 in Gabonese compared to German placentae as well as significantly lower levels of plasma IgG4 in newborns resulting in a significantly higher IgE/IgG4 ratio. These findings demonstrate that exposure in utero to different environments alters placental gene expression and thus possibly plays a role in the development and modulation of the immune system of the offspring.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670003>Injected laquinimod D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate polymeric micelles for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic relapsing disorders of the gastrointestinal tract characterized pathologically by intestinal  and epithelial injury. Laquinimod (LAQ), a poorly water-soluble compound, was proved to be effective for colitis remission at low dose of 0.5 mg/kg in patients with Crohn's disease. Due to its extremely low solubility in water, it was difficult to develop an injectable liquid dosage form. Herein, D-α-Tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate (TPGS) polymeric micelles were developed as a delivery vehicle of LAQ for the management of inflammatory bowel disease. Using the LAQ/TPGS ratio of 1:100, LAQ-loaded micelles were successfully prepared by thin-film dispersion method. The solubility of LAQ in water was significantly increased from 10.5 μg/mL in pure water to 500 μg/mL in TPGS micelles. LAQ-loaded micelles of TPGS exhibited the fine particle size of 34.6 nm and Zeta potential of -0.67 mV. Moreover, the good stability of LAQ-loaded micelles in physiology-mimicking medium was confirmed by detecting their particle size, zeta potential and leakage of the loading drug. Therapeutic effect of LAQ-loaded micelles on DSS-induced mice was proved by detecting DAI score, colon length and loss of body weight. Moreover, the morphology and colonic mucosal barrier of the injured colon of DSS-induced mice was largely recovered after treatment with LAQ-loaded micelles. Meanwhile, the  of colitis colon was also obviously alleviated by LAQ-loaded micelles. Conclusively, polymeric micelles of TPGS may be a promising delivery vehicle of LAQ for the management of inflammatory bowel disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To enhance the therapeutic efficacy of curcumin, we exploited polymeric prodrug strategy. Here, we report rationally designed acid-activatable curcumin polymer (ACP), as a therapeutic prodrug of curcumin, in which curcumin was covalently incorporated in the backbone of amphiphilic polymer. ACP could self-assemble to form micelles that rapidly release curcumin under the acidic condition. The potential of ACP micelles as therapeutics for osteoarthritis was evaluated using a mouse model of monoidoacetic acid (MIA)-induced knee osteoarthritis. ACP micelles drastically protected the articular structures from arthritis through the suppression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β). Given their pathological stimulus-responsiveness and potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, ACP micelles hold remarkable potential as a therapeutic agent for not only osteoarthritis but also various inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2019.

This study aimed to study the influence of dexmedetomidine (Dex) on NPP. Chronic constriction injury (CCI) was operated to form the NPP rat model. The OX42 and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), the nerve growth factors (NGFs), and the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) proteins were separately detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or Western blot. Inflammatory factors were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results demonstrated that Dex obviously alleviated CCI-stimulated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Meanwhile, the expressions of interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, chemokine c-X3-c-motif ligand 1, and C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 were greatly increased in CCI rats, but these effects were reversed by Dex. In addition, Dex promoted the expressions of NGF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophins-3 (NT-3), and NT-4 in CCI rats. Moreover, the RNA or protein expression levels of OX42 and GFAP were significantly increased in CCI rats, while Dex inhibited the expressions of OX42 and GFAP. Furthermore, Dex blocked JAK/STAT signaling pathway by decreasing p-JAK and p-STAT in CCI rats. Dex had the potential to alleviate NPP by regulating JAK/STAT pathway in CCI rat.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672577>Targeted depletion of monocyte/macrophage suppresses aortic dissection with the spatial regulation of MMP-9 in the aorta.</a></h1><p>Aortic dissection (AD) is a devastating disease with rapid progression and high mortality, while the initiation mechanism of AD is far from clear.AD was established by feeding mice with β-aminopropionitrile in the diet and usage of angiotensin II (AngII) to trigger the rupture of aorta. LysM mice were constructed by crossing of LysM-Cre mice with ROSA26iDTR mice and characterized by diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) expression in monocytes/macrophages specifically. Then, monocyte/macrophage depletion in LysM mice was conducted to evaluate the function of monocyte/macrophage in AD. Finally, the underlying mechanism was elucidated by proteomics, Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence staining and bioinformatics analysis.First, we detected T lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils infiltrated into the aorta simultaneously when AD occurred, and macrophages were the most abundant cell type. Then, targeted depletion of monocyte/macrophage in LysM mice considerably inhibited the occurrence of AD and infiltration of T lymphocytes and neutrophils. Furthermore, monocyte transfusion into LysM mice augmented the rupture of aorta, jointly supporting the key roles of monocytes/macrophages in AD development. Mechanistically, a total of 347 proteins exhibited significant differences in intensity after monocyte/macrophage depletion according to quantitative mass spectrometry. Specifically, increased matrix metalloprotein-9 (MMP-9) level in AD may be of concern due to its functions in vascular remodeling. The infiltration of macrophages considerably up-regulated MMP-9, and MMP-9 co-localized with macrophages at the tearing area of aorta.Macrophages infiltrated into the tear sites of the aortic wall, regulated extracellular remodeling pathway, functioned as initiators to switch on the occurrence of AD.Copyright © 2019.

Intestinal porcine epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium with high glucose (DMEM-H) medium containing 0 or 10 μg/ml EUF, 0 or 40 ng/mL LPS. The results showed that LPS impaired DNA synthesis, cell viability, mitochondrial function, arrested cell cycle and induced apoptosis, reduced SOD activity while the EUF treated cells provide beneficial effect on all these parameters (P < 0.05). The addition of EUF increased phosphorylated Akt, IκBα and phosphorylated IKKα/β, but decreased Bax and Caspase-3 protein expressions in LPS-treated cells (P < 0.05). For the second experiment, cells were treated by DMEM-H medium containing 10 μg/mL EUF+ 40 ng/mL LPS or 10 μg/mL EUF+ 40 ng/mL LPS+ 10 μmol/L LY29400. EUF + LPS + LY29400 treatment significantly reduced cell viability, proliferation, mitochondrial bioenergetics parameters, SOD activity, and decreased protein expressions of PI3K, p-Akt, p-IKKα/β, p-NFκB and Bax (P < 0.05). These findings reveal the cytoprotective effects of EUF in enterocyte, which may involve the PI3K-NFκB signaling pathway, and it provides a theoretical basis for exploration of EUF as a potential anti-inflammatory compound to intervene intestinal inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2019.

This study describes the proportion of patients with CAP and afebrile bacteremia and identifies the clinical characteristics predicting the necessity for BCs in afebrile patients.Bacteremia rates were determined in 4349 CAP patients enrolled in the multi-national cohort study CAPNETZ and stratified by presence of fever at first patient contact. Independent predictors of bacteremia in afebrile patients were determined retrospectively using logistic regression analysis.Bacteremic pneumonia was present in 190 of 2116 (8.9%) febrile patients, 101 of 2149 (4.7%) afebrile patients and 1 of 23 (4.3%) hypothermic patients. Bacteremia rates increased with the CURB-65 score from 3.5% in patients with CURB-65 score of 0 to 17.1% in patients with CURB-65 score of 4. Patients with afebrile bacteremia exhibited the highest 28-day mortality rate (9.9%). Positive pneumococcal urinary antigen test (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 4.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.6-8.2), C-reactive protein >200 mg/l (AOR 3.1, 95% CI 1.9-5.2) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) ≥30 mg/dl (AOR 3.1, 95% CI 1.9-5.3) were independent positive predictors and antibiotic pre-treatment (AOR 0.3, 95% confidence interval 0.1-0.6) was an independent negative predictor of bacteremia in afebrile patients.A relevant proportion of patients with bacteremic CAP was afebrile. These patients had an increased mortality rate compared to patients with febrile bacteremia or non-bacteremic pneumonia. Therefore, the relevance of fever as an indicator for BC necessity merits reconsideration.Copyright © 2019.

In view of this scenario, the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) promoted and supported an international collaborative study (EULAR SS Task Force) aimed at developing the first EULAR evidence and consensus-based recommendations for the management of patients with SjS with topical and systemic medications. The aim was to develop a rational therapeutic approach to SjS patients useful for healthcare professionals, physicians undergoing specialist training, medical students, the pharmaceutical industry and drug regulatory organisations following the 2014 EULAR standardised operating procedures. The Task Force (TF) included specialists in rheumatology, internal medicine, oral health, ophthalmology, gynaecology, dermatology and epidemiology, statisticians, general practitioners, nurses and patient representatives from 30 countries of the 5 continents. Evidence was collected from studies including primary SjS patients fulfilling the 2002/2016 criteria; when no evidence was available, evidence from studies including associated SjS or patients fulfilling previous sets of criteria was considered and extrapolated. The TF endorsed the presentation of general principles for the management of patients with SjS as three overarching, general consensus-based recommendations and 12 specific recommendations that form a logical sequence, starting with the management of the central triplet of symptoms (dryness, fatigue and pain) followed by the management of systemic disease. The recommendations address the use of topical oral (saliva substitutes) and ocular (artificial tear drops, topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, topical corticosteroids, topical CyA, serum tear drops) therapies, oral muscarinic agonists (pilocarpine, cevimeline), hydroxychloroquine, oral glucocorticoids, synthetic immunosuppressive agents (cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, leflunomide and mycophenolate), and biological therapies (rituximab, abatacept and belimumab). For each recommendation, levels of evidence (mostly modest) and TF agreement (mostly very high) are provided. The 2019 EULAR recommendations are based on the evidence collected in the last 16 years in the management of primary 2002 SjS patients and on discussions between a large and broadly international TF. The recommendations synthesise current thinking on SjS treatment in a set of overarching principles and recommendations. We hope that the current recommendations will be broadly applied in clinical practice and/or serve as a template for national societies to develop local recommendations.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

This finding could result from the translocation of still alive bacteria from gut to joints through blood, since the diversified dormant microbiota of healthy human blood can be transiently resuscitated in vitro. The recent finding of gut microbiome in human cartilage, which differed between osteoarthritis and controls, suggests that a similar trafficking of dead or alive bacteria from gut microbiota physiologically occurs between gut and epiphysial bone marrow. Subchondral microbiota could enhance cartilage healing and transform components of deep cartilage matrix in metabolites with immunosuppressive properties. The differences of microbiome observed between hip and knee cartilage, either in osteoarthritis or controls, might be the counterpart of subtle differences in chondrocyte metabolism, themselves in line with differences in DNA methylation according to joints. Although bacteria theoretically cannot reach chondrocytes from the surface of intact cartilage, some bacteria enter the vascular channels of the epiphysial growth cartilage in young animals, whereas others can infect chondrocytes in vitro. In osteoarthritis, the early osteochondral plate angiogenesis may further enhance the ability of microbiota to locate close to the deeper layers of cartilage, and this might lead to focal dysbiosis, low-grade , cartilage degradation, epigenetic changes in chondrocytes and worsening of osteoarthritis. More studies on cartilage across different ethnic groups, weights, and according to age, are needed, to confirm the silent presence of gut microbiota close to human cartilage and better understand its physiologic and pathogenic significance.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Iron fortificants adversely affect the infant gut microbiota, while co-provision of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) mitigates most of the adverse effects. Whether variations in maternal HMO profile can influence the infant response to iron and/or GOS fortificants is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine HMO profiles and the secretor/non-secretor phenotype of lactating Kenyan mothers and investigate their effects on the maternal and infant gut microbiota, and on the infant response to a fortification intervention with 5 mg iron (2.5 mg as sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetate and 2.5 mg as ferrous fumarate) and 7.5 g GOS. We studied mother-infant pairs ( = 80) participating in a 4-month intervention trial in which the infants (aged 6.5-9.5 months) received daily a micronutrient powder without iron, with iron or with iron and GOS. We assessed: (1) maternal secretor status and HMO composition; (2) effects of secretor status on the maternal and infant gut microbiota in a cross-sectional analysis at baseline of the intervention trial; and (3) interactions between secretor status and intervention groups during the intervention trial on the infant gut microbiota, gut , iron status, growth and infectious morbidity. Secretor prevalence was 72% and HMOs differed between secretors and non-secretors and over time of lactation. Secretor status did not predict the baseline composition of the maternal and infant gut microbiota. There was a secretor-status-by-intervention-group interaction on  ( = 0.021), Z-scores for length-for-age ( = 0.022) and weight-for-age ( = 0.018), and soluble transferrin receptor ( = 0.041). In the no iron group, longitudinal prevalence of diarrhea was higher among infants of non-secretors (23.8%) than of secretors (10.4%) ( = 0.001). In conclusion, HMO profile may modulate the infant gut microbiota response to fortificant iron; compared to infants of secretor mothers, infants of non-secretor mothers may be more vulnerable to the adverse effect of iron but also benefit more from the co-provision of GOS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672458>Changes in oxidative nucleic acid modifications and  following one-week treatment with the bile acid sequestrant sevelamer: Two randomised, placebo-controlled trials.</a></h1><p>Sevelamer has been reported to have anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects as well as effects on glycaemic control and plasma lipids. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of one-week treatment with sevelamer on oxidative nucleic acid modifications and  markers.Two double-blinded studies including 30 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 20 healthy individuals were conducted. Participants were randomised to one week of treatment with sevelamer (1600 mg three times daily) or placebo.

However, the effect of iron-overload on the brain of Thalassemic condition has never been investigated. An iron chelator (deferiprone) provides neuroprotective effects against metal toxicity. Furthermore, a T-type calcium channels blocker (efonidipine) effectively attenuates cardiac dysfunction in thalassemic mice with iron-overload. However, the effects of both drugs on brain of iron-overload Thalassemia has not been determined. We hypothesize that iron-overload induces neurotoxicity in Thalassemic and wild-type mice, and not only deferiprone, but also efonidipine, provides neuroprotection against iron-overload condition.Mice from both wild-type (WT) and β-thalassemic type (HT) groups were assigned to be fed with a standard-diet or high-iron diet containing 0.2% ferrocene/kg of diet (HFe) for 4 months consecutively. After three months of HFe, 75-mg/kg/d deferiprone or 4-mg/kg/d efonidipine were administered to the HFe-fed WT and HT mice for 1 month.HFe consumption caused an equal impact on circulating iron-overload, oxidative stress, and  in WT and HT mice. Brain iron-overload and iron-mediated neurotoxicity, such as oxidative stress, , glial activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and Alzheimer's like pathologies, were observed to an equal degree in HFe fed WT and HT mice. These pathological conditions were mitigated by both deferiprone and efonidipine.These findings indicate that iron-overload itself caused neurotoxicity, and T-type calcium channels may play a role in this condition.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the major surface molecule of most gram-negative bacteria and routinely used as a sepsis model in investigation studies. Crocin is an active compound of saffron which has different pharmacological properties such as anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory. In this research, the protective effect of crocin was evaluated against LPS-induced toxicity in the embryonic cardiomyocyte cell line (H9c2).The cells were pre-treated with different concentration of crocin (10, 20 and 40 μM) for 24 h, and then LPS was added (10 μg/ml) for another 24 h. Afterward, the percentage of cell viability and the levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, PGE, IL-1β, and IL-6), gene expression levels (TNF-α, COX-2, IL-1β, IL-6, and iNOS), and the level of nitric oxide (NO) and thiol were measured.Our results showed that LPS reduced cell viability, increased the levels of cytokines, gene-expression, nitric oxide, and thiol. Crocin attenuated the LPS-induced toxicity in H9c2 cells via reducing the levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, PGE, IL-1β, and IL-6, p < 0.001), gene expression (TNF-α, COX-2, IL-1β, IL-6, and iNOS, p < 0.001), and NO (p < 0.001), whereas increased the level of thiol content (p < 0.001).The observed results revealed that crocin has preventive effects on the LPS induced sepsis and its cardiac toxicity in-vitro model. Probably, these findings are related to anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties of crocin. However, performing further animal studies are necessary to support the therapeutic effects of crocin in septic shock cardiac dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

It is associated with a mortality rate of 25%. It is characterised by; erythematous skin, which turns dusky blue before haemorrhagic bullae develop; localised pain; and . It is most commonly found in the extremities, the abdomen or the perineum but is rarely seen in the breast.We describe a 54-year-old lady who presented with breast erythema and raised inflammatory markers. Initially treated as cellulitis, however when her symptoms did not improve and despite IV antibiotics her bloods worsened, a CT scan was performed which showed a large volume of interstitial soft tissue gas with diffuse fat stranding, consistent with necrotising fasciitis. Debridement of her breast alongside the use of sensitive antibiotics and ITU support led to a satisfactory outcome.We discuss how an early diagnosis can be made by the recognition of a triad of symptoms common in necrotising fasciitis, and how optimal management can be achieved with the incorporation of imaging to successfully identify the condition and allow targeted debridement of the areas of necrotising fasciitis.A high index of suspicion should be held if pain is disproportionate to the signs or sepsis is present. To aid an early diagnosis, imaging of the breast should be performed early to avoid delay in treatment.Copyright © 2019.

Mean vitreous  was 2+ cell at 1 week postoperatively. Two patients had documented sterile endophthalmitis within the first week requiring vitreous cultures and antibiotics injections. Visual acuity (VA) for eyes requiring PPV for RD repair declined from 20/90 preoperatively to 20/212 at 6 months postoperatively. VA for eyes amenable to laser alone improved from 20/53 to 20/35. All eyes remained attached, with the exception of one patient who refused further treatment after developing recurrent detachment from PVR.Particle-induced sterile endophthalmitis from IVTA depot at the end of PPV surgery resulted in atrophic inferior retinal breaks and RRD as a newly described entity coined "erosive retinopathy." All retinal detachment surgeries required silicone oil tamponade. Poor visual outcome at 6 months was common for eyes requiring PPV for RD repair. The authors recommend avoiding IVTA depot injection at the end of PPV.

The regularity and intensity of exercise is modulated at the molecular level in the skeletal muscle by two protein kinases, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which act as sensors of external stimuli, showing the energy status of muscular fibers. The mTOR pathway is activated by insulin and amino acid availability, and its metabolic actions culminate in increased protein synthesis and reduced autophagy, leading to an increase in muscle mass. In contrast, AMPK activation induces a transcriptional program aimed to increase the mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, transforming fast-twitch glycolytic fibers to slow-twitch oxidative fibers and increasing resistance to fatigue. In addition, inadequate exercise training induces imbalance in the immune response, generating excessive  and/or immunosuppression. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that provide insight into dietary protein interventions and/or amino acid supplementation that may improve outcomes after exercise by modulating 1) mTOR and AMPK activation during early exercise recovery, leading to increased muscle protein synthesis or increased oxidative capacity; 2) undesirable inflammatory responses; and 3) fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels that may have relevant implications in skeletal muscle metabolism, particularly during the exercise recovery and performance of obese subjects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Over-activation of the NF-κB pathway is a feature of colorectal cancer (CRC). While new combinatorial treatments have improved overall patient outcome; quality of life, cost of care, and patient survival rate have seen little improvement. Suppression of the NF-κB signaling pathway using biological or specific pharmacological inhibitors is a potential therapeutic approach in the treatment of colon cancer. This review summarizes the regulatory role of NF-κB signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of CRC for a better understanding and hence a better management of the disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

But the molecular signatures related to the mechanism of HF have not been systematically explored. Here, we present comprehensive proteomic analysis of EAT in HF patients and non-HF patients as controls. A total of 771 proteins were identified in liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiments. Amongst them, 17 increased in abundance in HF and seven decreased. They were involved in HF-related processes including  and oxidative stress response and lipid metabolism. Of these proteins, serine proteinase inhibitor A3 (Serpina3) levels in EAT were highly up-regulated in HF, with HF/non-HF ratio of 4.63 (P = .0047). Gene expression of Serpina3 via quantitative polymerase chain reaction was significantly increased in the HF group. ELISA analysis confirmed a significant increase in circulating plasma Serpina3 levels in the HF group (P = .004). In summary, for the first time, we describe that parts of EAT proteome may be reactive and work as modulators of HF. Our profiling provides a comprehensive basis for linking EAT with pathogenesis of HF. Understanding the role of EAT may offer new insights into the treatment of HF.© 2019 The Authors.

Macrophage polarization is important in the development and progression of . However, whether luteolin can inhibit  by regulating the polarized phenotypes of macrophages remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of luteolin on the inflammatory polarization of macrophages and the underlying mechanisms. RAW264.7 macrophages were induced to M1 polarization by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide plus interferon-γ or to M2 polarization with interleukin 4 (IL-4), simultaneously, accompanied with different concentrations of luteolin. Laser confocal microscopy was used to observe cell morphology; flow cytometry was employed to detect the expression of membrane surface molecule CD86 and CD206; qPCR was performed to examine the mRNA expression of M1 markers (iNOS, IL-1β, IL-6) and M2 markers (Arg1, CD206, CD163, IL-10, and IL-13), respectively; ELISA was used to examine the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10; and Western blotting was used to evaluate the p-STAT3 and p-STAT6 protein pathway. The morphology of activated M1 macrophages changed significantly, developing dendritic characteristics. After luteolin treatment, the expression of M1-type proinflammatory mediators and the surface marker CD86 were decreased evidently, but those of M2-related anti-inflammatory factors and CD206 were increased markedly. Moreover, p-STAT3 was downregulated and p-STAT6 was upregulated in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion, luteolin can alter the M1/M2 polarization of macrophages, thereby playing an anti-inflammatory role via downregulation of p-STAT3 and upregulation of p-STAT6. Therefore, luteolin may be potentially valuable to inhibit .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671184>Selective small-molecule EPAC activators.</a></h1><p>The cellular signalling enzymes, EPAC1 and EPAC2, have emerged as key intracellular sensors of the secondary messenger cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) alongside protein kinase A.

Studies have shown that brain damage, sequelae and neuropsychological deficits depend not only on the direct deleterious action of the pathogens, but also on the host defenses themselves.: Corticosteroids (CS) were the first drugs used with the intent to limit the exaggerated host response. However, as steroid addition to antibiotics is frequently unsatisfactory, other measures have been suggested. In this study, the most important adjuvant therapies that are potentially useful to limit the neuropsychological damage of BM are discussed.: The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to the development of brain damage are not completely defined. Moreover, the efficacy of adjuvant therapies can vary according to the aetiologic cause of BM, and differences in immune system function of the host can play a relevant role in the expression of  and related problems. It is likely that none of the measures with demonstrated efficacy in animal models can be translated into clinical practice in the next few years, suggesting that to reduce the total burden of BM, the increased use of vaccines seems to be the best solution.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673142>Gene expression profile analysis of ileum transcriptomes in pigs fed Gelsemium elegans plants.</a></h1><p>Gelsemium elegans is a flowering plant in the Loganiaceae.

Additional information was gathered from books, Ph.D. and M.Sc. dissertations, and unpublished materials.and discussion: F. hispida is used especially in Chinese and Indian traditional medical systems as a remedy for skin disorders, respiratory diseases, and urinary diseases. Wound healing, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, sedative, antidiarrheal, antiulcer, antimicrobial, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, antineoplastic, and antidiabetic activities have been reported for crude extracts and isolated metabolites, but the methodologies in these studies often have inadequate design and low technical quality. More than 76 compounds have been isolated from F.hispida, including sesquiterpenoids and triterpenoids, flavonoids, coumarins, phenylpropionic acids, benzoic acid derivatives, alkaloids, steroids, other glycosides, and alkanes, but the method of bioassay-guided fractionation is seldom applied in the isolation from F. hispida.F. hispida is used widely in traditional medicines and has multiple pharmacological effects that could support traditional uses. However, pharmacological studies should be viewed with caution because of the inappropriate experimental design. More in vitro and in vivo research is urgently needed to study the molecular mechanisms and assess the effective and safe dose of F. hispida.Copyright © 2019.

Measurements of circulating -related biomarkers may inform etiology or provide non-invasive signatures for early diagnosis. We therefore examined levels of  molecules for associations with ESCC risk. Using a case-cohort study designed within the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study, we measured baseline plasma levels of 92 biomarkers using a multiplex assay in a subcohort of 410 randomly selected participants and 66 participants with incident ESCC (including 4 cases that occurred in the subcohort). ESCC hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for 2-4 quantiles of each biomarker by Cox proportional hazards regression models with age as the time metric, adjusted for sex, smoking and alcohol use. Twenty analytes were undetectable in nearly all samples. Of the remaining 72, 12 biomarkers (FGF19, ST1A1, STAMBP, AXIN1, CASP8, NT3, CD6, CDCP1, CD5, SLAMF1, OPG and CSF1) were associated with increased ESCC risk (P <0.05) with HRs per quantile 1.28-1.65. Seven biomarkers (CXCL6, CCL23, CXCL5, TGFA, CXCL1, OSM and CCL4) were inversely associated with HRs 0.57-0.72. FGF19, CASP8, STAMBP, ST1A1 and CCL-4 met statistical significance with false discovery rate correction. Associations did not differ <5 vs. ≥5 years between blood collection and ESCC diagnosis. CASP8, STAMBP and ST1A1 were strongly correlated (p<0.05). This study expands the range of  molecules associated with the development of this highly lethal neoplasia. Correlations among these novel biomarkers suggest a possible shared pathway. These findings need replication and could further delineate ESCC's molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis.

All patients had follow-up biopsy (Bx) after treatment.33 (9.1%) patients had diagnosis of AMR. Mean follow-up was 35 ± 20 months. 28.5% of patients had poor clinical progression at the last follow-up. Of the 25 patients with functional grafts, the mean serum creatinine was 1.6 ± 0.6 mg/dL for live and 2.1 ± 1.0 mg/dL for deceased transplant recipients. In diagnostic biopsies, there were 61% MTR. In follow-up Bx, after treatment, both C4d positivity and the severity of rejection had decreased while the mean chronic allograft damage index (CADI) score and transplant glomerulopathy showed an increase.With effective antibody mediated rejection (AMR) therapy, renal function parameters were significantly improved. Histologically, improvement in tubulointerstitial  may be responsible for this process.

Here, we aimed to determine the normal reference values for USPIO-enhanced MRI in patients with a prior cardiac transplant and examine whether USPIO-enhanced MRI could detect myocardial  in patients with transplant rejection.Ten volunteers and 11 patients with cardiac transplant underwent T2, T2* and late gadolinium enhancement 1.5T MRI, with further T2* imaging at 24 hours after USPIO (ferumoxytol, 4 mg/kg) infusion, at baseline and 3 months.Ten patients with clinically stable cardiac transplantation were retained for analysis. Myocardial T2 values were higher in patients with cardiac transplant versus healthy volunteers (53.8±5.2 vs 48.6±1.9 ms, respectively; p=0.003). There were no differences in the magnitude of USPIO-induced change in R2* in patients with transplantation (change in R2*, 26.6±7.3 vs 22.0±10.4 s in healthy volunteers; p=0.28).

The two isoforms, LXRα (NR1H3) and LXRβ (NR1H2), are differentially expressed, with the former expressed predominantly in metabolically active tissues and the latter more ubiquitously. Both are activated by oxidised cholesterol metabolites, endogenously produced oxysterols. LXRs have important roles in lipid metabolism and , plus a number of newly emerging roles. They are implicated in regulating lipid balance in normal male reproductive function and may provide a link between male infertility and lipid disorders and/or obesity. Studies from Lxr knockout mouse models provide compelling evidence to support this. More recently published data suggest distinct and overlapping roles of the LXR isoforms in the testis and recent evidence of a role for LXRs in human male fertility.

NO is synthesized from l-arginine through the action of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) family of enzymes, which includes three isoforms: endothelial NOS (eNOS), neuronal NOS (nNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS). iNOS-derived NO has been associated with the pathogenesis and progression of several diseases, including liver diseases, insulin resistance, obesity and diseases of the cardiovascular system. However, transient NO production can modulate metabolism to survive and cope with stress conditions. Accumulating evidence strongly imply that iNOS-derived NO plays a central role in the regulation of several biochemical pathways and energy metabolism including glucose and lipid metabolism during inflammatory conditions. This review summarizes current evidence for the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism by iNOS during , and argues for the role of iNOS as a metabolic enzyme in immune and non-immune cells.Copyright © 2019.

Workers exposed to ZnO particles may develop metal fume fever. Our previous study suggested that the oropharyngeal aspiration of ZnONPs could cause eosinophilic airway  and increase T helper 2 (Th2) cytokine expression in the absence of allergens in mice. ZnO has been used topically as a sunscreen and a therapeutic agent for dermatological conditions. To understand whether inhalation and topically applied ZnONPs might cause or exert an adjuvant effect on the development of allergic airway  in mice, C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to filtered air or 2.5 mg/m ZnONPs via whole-body inhalation for 5 h a day over 5 days, and BALB/c mice were topically exposed to ZnONPs using modified mouse models of atopic dermatitis (AD) and asthma. Ovalbumin (OVA) solution was used as an allergen in the topical exposure experiments. A significantly increased eosinophil count and mixed Th1/Th2 cytokine expression were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) after ZnONP inhalation. However, only mild eosinophilia and low Th2 cytokine expression were detected in the BALF after oropharyngeal OVA aspiration in the high-dose ZnONP topical treatment group. These results suggest that ZnONP inhalation might play a role in the development of allergic airway  in mice. However, topically applied ZnONPs only play a limited role in the development of allergic airway  in mice.Copyright © 2019.

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is found to be closely involved in the regulation of gut microbial dynamics. However, it is still not clear how AhR signaling shapes the gut microbiota. In the present study, adult zebrafish were acutely exposed to an AhR antagonist (CH223191), an AhR agonist (polychlorinated biphenyl 126; PCB126) or their combination for 7 d. Overall intestinal health and gut microbial community were temporally monitored (1 d, 3 d and 7 d) and inter-compared among different groups. The results showed that single exposure to PCB126 significantly disrupted the overall health of intestines (i.e., neural signaling, , epithelial barrier integrity, oxidative stress). However, CH223191 failed to inhibit but enhanced the physiological toxicities of PCB126, implying the involvement of extra mechanisms rather than AhR in the regulation of intestinal physiological activities. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota was also caused by PCB126 over time as a function of sex. It is intriguing that CH223191 successfully abolished the holistic effects of dioxin on gut microbiota, which inferred that growth of gut microbes was directly controlled by AhR activation without the involvement of host feedback modulation. When coming to detailed alterations at certain taxon, both antagonistic and synergistic interactions existed between CH223191 and dioxin, depending on fish sex, exposure duration and bacterial species. Correlation analysis found that gut  was positively associated with pathogenic Legionella bacteria, but was negatively associated with epithelial barrier integrity, suggesting that integral intestinal epithelial barrier can prevent the influx of pathogenic bacteria to induce inflammatory response. Overall, this study has deciphered, for the first time, the direct regulative effects of AhR activity on gut microbiota. Future research is warranted to elucidate the specific mechanisms of AhR action on certain bacterial population.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the pathogenesis of dry eye has not been fully understood, the role of increased tear osmolarity has been established. There is increasing evidence that dry eye is an inflammatory disease. This article aims to investigate the potential pathogenicity of inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-33 and its receptor ST2 in dry eye.Human conjunctival epithelial cells (HConECs) were stimulated with hyperosmolality to produce a dry eye cell model. Real-time PCR evaluated the IL-33 mRNA level, and western blotting assessed IL-33 protein expression. Clinical data (sex, age, ocular surface disease index [OSDI] score, tear film breakup time, Schirmer test, and corneal fluorescein staining [CFS]) of patients with DE were collected. Conjunctival impression cytology (CIC) specimens were collected to detect the protein expression of IL-33 and ST2 with western blotting. Tears were collected with Schirmer strips, and analyzed using multiplex assay kits to examine IL-33 and its downstream factors IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13.The IL-33 mRNA level of the HConECs increased in the hyperosmotic state (relative 4.35-fold upregulation, p<0.001). The IL-33 protein expression of HConECs also showed higher levels in the hyperosmotic state (relative 2.22-fold upregulation, p<0.01). A total of 25 patients with dry eye and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled. There were no statistically significant differences in age and sex between the two groups. The OSDI score, tear film breakup time, Schirmer test, and ocular surface staining of the two groups were statistically significantly different. The IL-33 and ST2 protein levels were increased in patients with DE versus controls (IL-33: relative 9.25-fold upregulation, p<0.001; ST2: relative 4.35-fold upregulation, p<0.05). The concentrations of IL-33, IL-13, and IL-5 in tears increased in patients with DE versus controls (IL-33: 3.00-fold upregulation, p<0.0001; IL-13: 6.65-fold upregulation, p<0.0001; IL-5: 16.54 -fold upregulation, p=0.01). IL-13 and IL-5 were statistically significantly correlated with IL-33. The level of IL-33 was positively correlated with the OSDI score and CFS, but was negatively correlated with the Schirmer I test and the tear film breakup time (TBUT). The level of IL-13 was positively correlated only with the CFS, and was negatively correlated with the Schirmer I test. The level of IL-5 was positively correlated with the OSDI score and CFS. We failed to detect the concentration of IL-4, as most samples were below the detection limit.The IL-33 mRNA and protein levels of HConECs increased under hyperosmolality. The IL-33 and ST2 protein levels were higher in the CIC of patients with DE, and have correlations with disease severity. Moreover, the concentrations of IL-13 and IL-5 released from activated type 2 helper T (Th2) cells increased in the tears of patients with DE. The IL-33/ST2 pathway might play a priming role in the regulation of  of the ocular surface.Copyright © 2019 Molecular Vision.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671427>Inhibition of hypothalamic inhibitor κ B kinase β/nuclear transcription factor κ B pathway attenuates metabolism and cardiac dysfunction in type 2 diabetic rats.</a></h1><p> and oxidative stressplay important roles in energy imbalance and its complications.Recent research indicates that hypothalamic  may contribute to the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and cardiac dysfunction, but the mechanisms remain unclear.

K1.3 ion channel is a voltage-gated potassium channel and has been validated as a drug target for autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases like psoriasis. Here we experimentally test the direct interaction between monoterpenes and K1.3 ion channel. Our electrophysiological analysis determined that monoterpenes (geraniol, nerol, β-citronellol, citral and linalool) have inhibitory effects on K1.3 ion channel. Representatively, geraniol reversibly blocked K1.3 currents in a voltage-dependent manner with an IC of 490.50 ± 1.04 μM at +40 mV in HEK293T cells. At the effective concentrations, geraniol also inhibited cytokine secretion of activated human T cells, including IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-γ. In an imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like animal model, geraniol administration significantly reduced psoriasis area and severity index scores, ameliorated the deteriorating histopathology and decreased the degree of splenomegaly. Together, our findings not only suggest that monoterpenes may serve as lead molecules for the development of K1.3 inhibitors, but also indicate that geraniol could be considered as a promising therapeutic candidate to treat autoimmune diseases.Copyright © 2018.

Multivariate models controlling for physical and mental health scores were constructed to assess how demographic and cultural factors were associated with PO use.A total of 9.3% were using POs at the time of the baseline visit. In multivariate models, persons of Cuban background (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI; 0.21, 0.81]) and of Dominican background (AOR = 0.38, 95% CI [0.18, 0.80]) were significantly less likely to use POs compared with a reference group of persons of Mexican background. Greater language acculturation was also negatively associated with PO use (AOR = 0.68, 95% CI [0.53, 0.87]).POs were used relatively uncommonly, and use showed marked variation between Hispanic/Latino groups.

Treatments for fibrosis remain experimental, in part because no unifying mechanism has been identified that initiates liver fibrosis. Necroptosis has been implicated in multiple liver diseases. Here, we report that O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification protects against hepatocyte necroptosis and initiation of liver fibrosis. Decreased O-GlcNAc levels were seen in patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis and in mice with ethanol-induced liver injury. Liver-specific O-GlcNAc transferase-KO (OGT-LKO) mice exhibited hepatomegaly and ballooning degeneration at an early age and progressed to liver fibrosis and portal  by 10 weeks of age. OGT-deficient hepatocytes underwent excessive necroptosis and exhibited elevated protein expression levels of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL), which are key mediators of necroptosis. Furthermore, glycosylation of RIPK3 by OGT is associated with reduced RIPK3 protein stability. Taken together, these findings identify OGT as a key suppressor of hepatocyte necroptosis, and OGT-LKO mice may serve as an effective spontaneous genetic model of liver fibrosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672717>Association of intestinal permeability with admission vitamin D deficiency in patients who are critically ill.</a></h1><p>Emerging data have led to the hypothesis that vitamin D plays a role in promoting epithelial barrier dysfunction. Therefore, intestinal permeability becomes a significant determiner in the future of patients hospitalized in intensive care unit (ICU). The relationship between vitamin D and intestinal permeability remains unclear in patients who are critically ill. The aim of the study is to document the relationship between the admission vitamin D deficiency and markers of intestinal permeability in the critical care setting. This was a single-center, observational, prospective study in the general ICU of a university-affiliated hospital. A sample of 144 ICU-hospitalized adult patients was recruited between January and May 2018. The admission serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured and categorized as <20 and ≥20 ng/dL, respectively. Moreover, the admission plasma endotoxin and zonulin concentrations as markers of intestinal permeability were determined in stringent conditions. The association between markers of intestinal permeability and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels was assessed adjusting for potential confounders through an estimation of a binary logistic regression model. Our results showed that median plasma endotoxin and zonulin decreased with increasing serum levels of vitamin D categories (p=0.001) in the overall study population. Multivariate binary logistic regression analyses showed a significant association between the plasma endotoxin (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.52) and zonulin (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.99) levels with serum levels of vitamin D categories in the overall population. Our finding suggests a relationship between vitamin D deficiency and early alterations in intestinal permeability. Thus, evaluating vitamin D levels in patients who are critically ill may be warranted.© American Federation for Medical Research 2019. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

A wide range of therapeutic approaches were developed but re-tears and postoperative complications occur regularly. Especially in elderly people, the natural regeneration processes are decelerated and graft materials are often necessary to stabilize the tendon-to-bone attachment and to improve the healing process. We here investigated in a small animal model a newly developed electrospun polycaprolactone fibre implant coated with a chitosan-polycaprolactone graft copolymer and compared these implants biomechanically and histologically with either a commercially available porous polyurethane implant (Biomerix 3D Scaffold™) or suture-fixed tendons. Fifty-one rats were divided into three groups of 17 animals each. In a first surgery, the left infraspinatus tendons of all rats were detached and the animals recovered for four weeks. In a second surgery, the tendons were fixed with suture material only (suture-fixed group; n = 17) whereas in the two experimental groups, the tendons were fixed with suture material and the polyurethane implant (Biomerix scaffold group; n = 17) or the modified electrospun polycaprolactone fibre implant (CS-g-PCL scaffold group; n = 17), respectively. The unaffected right infraspinatus tendons were used as native controls. After a recovery of eight weeks, all animals were clinically inconspicuous. In twelve animals of each group repaired entheses were biomechanically tested for force at failure, stiffness and modulus of elasticity and in five animals repaired entheses were analyzed histologically. Biomechanically all parameters did not differ statistically significant between both implant groups and the entheses failed typically at the surgical site. However, with respect to the force at failure, the median values of the two implant groups were smaller than the median value of the suture-fixed group. Histologically, the modified polycaprolactone fibre implant showed no acute  processes, a good infiltration with cells, ingrowth of blood vessels and tendinous tissue and a normal fibrous ensheathment. Further improvement of the implant material could be achieved by additional implementation of drug delivery systems. Therewith the used CS-g-PCL fibre mat is a promising basic material to reach the goal of a clinically usable graft for rotator cuff tear repair.This article is protected by copyright.

C57BL/6 type 8 week-old male mice (n = 10/per group) were fed with standard chow or three isocaloric diets consisting fructose, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), or saturated fatty acid (SFA) for 15 weeks. After the dietary manipulation, the mice were sacrificed, tissues and blood were collected. Consequently, body weight gains, liver weights, and plasma homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values in were at higher levels in SFA and fructose groups (p < 0.05). The plasma concentrations of the non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), triglyceride (TG), and liver steatosis were found to be at higher levels in SFA and fructose groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, the expression levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (ACC1), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) in the liver were affected by the intake of SFA and fructose. Furthermore, the plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1) and the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in the liver were elevated in SFA and fructose group (p < 0.05). The plasma level of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL -10) was found to be lower in the SFA group compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the  and oxidation are related with the fatty acid- and fructose-induced impaired insulin signaling and fat accumulation in liver. Hence, in order to decrease the oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory response, it is substantial to reduce the saturated fat and added sugar or to replace with the unsaturated fat and complex carbohydrates in diet.Copyright © 2019.

The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) has been observed prominently in obese and diabetic individuals, while alcoholic liver disease is common in alcoholic persons. Fatty liver disease, such as steatohepatitis, leads to fibrosis, cirrhosis and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) against high-fat diet (HFD) and ethanol (EtOH)-induced hepatotoxicity in rats.Male Wistar rats (150-200 g) were fed HFD (58% calories from fat) and EtOH (3-15% in drinking water) for 12 weeks. 7,8-DHF was administered intraperitoneally at the dose of 5 mg/kg/day for the last four weeks. After 12 weeks, biochemical, ELISA, RT-PCR, and histological studies have been carried out.Biochemical analyses revealed the involvement of oxidative stress and  in the liver of HFD and EtOH-fed rats. 7,8-DHF treatment significantly reduced HFD and EtOH-induced oxidative stress as evidenced by the reduction of lipid peroxidation and augmentation of reduced glutathione level. Moreover, IL-1β level was found significantly reduced in 7,8-DHF treated EtOH, HFD and EtOH+HFD groups.

This new drug has been approved as a safe and effective medication by a randomized, multinational, phase III clinical trial on RA patients. The present study aimed to evaluate the oral administration effect of M2000 on the expression levels of the mentioned genes in RA patients. This research was conducted on 12 RA patients and 12 healthy individuals. After extraction of total RNA from PBMCs of patients and synthesis of cDNA, the expression levels of miR-155, SOCS1, SHIP1, and NF-κB genes were measured through quantitative Real-time PCR at baseline and after 12 weeks of M2000 therapy. Our findings showed that the miR-155 gene expression level significantly decreased in the M2000-treated patients compared with the baseline (0.76-fold, with p < .05).

Previous studies have demonstrated that soluble RAGE (sRAGE) acts as a decoy for RAGE and protects cells against RAGE-mediated injury. The authors and other groups have reported that the expression of RAGE increases after brain ischemia and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and deletion of RAGE or overexpression of sRAGE improves neuronal survival. It has also been demonstrated that the plasma sRAGE level could be a predictor of the outcome after ischemic stroke. This study aimed to evaluate plasma sRAGE as a biomarker for symptomatic vasospasm (SVS) in SAH patients, as well as a rat model.The authors measured and compared plasma sRAGE levels in 27 SAH patients (7 with SVS and 20 without SVS) from day 5 to day 14 post-SAH. They also examined plasma sRAGE levels and expression of RAGE and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in a rat SAH model.The relative plasma sRAGE levels were significantly lower in the SVS group than in the non-SVS group of patients. A cut-off value of 0.84 for predicting SVS was considered to be appropriate for the relative plasma sRAGE levels on day 7 versus day 5. In the rat SAH model, plasma sRAGE levels were significantly lower than those in sham-treated rats, and the expressions of RAGE and HO-1 were enhanced in the SAH group compared with the non-SAH group.Plasma sRAGE levels can be used as a potential biomarker for predicting SVS after SAH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675482>DAMPs, PAMPs, and LAMPs in Immunity and Sterile .</a></h1><p>Recognizing the importance of leukocyte trafficking in  led to some therapeutic breakthroughs.

This review discusses leukocytes in the context of sterile , a process caused by sterile (non-microbial) molecules, comprising damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). DAMPs bind specific receptors to activate  and start a highly optimized sequence of immune cell recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes to initiate effective tissue repair. When DAMPs are cleared, the recruited leukocytes change from a proinflammatory to a reparative program, a switch that is locally supervised by invariant natural killer T cells. In addition, neutrophils exit the inflammatory site and reverse transmigrate back to the bloodstream.  persists when the program switch or reverse transmigration fails, or when the coordinated leukocyte effort cannot clear the immunostimulatory molecules.

Its more severe type, namely nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), may result in the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD, and especially NASH, are also associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) predisposes to NAFLD development and progression via insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. It has also been reported that the majority of T2DM patients have NAFLD/NASH, thus potentially further increasing their cardiometabolic risk. Current guidelines recommend to screen for NAFLD in all T2DM patients and vice-versa. Lifestyle remains the first-line therapeutic option for NAFLD/NASH. Among antidiabetic drugs, pioglitazone was shown to improve histological features of NASH. More recently, there is an increasing interest regarding the effects of newer anti-diabetic drugs, such as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on NAFLD/NASH. The present narrative review considers the up-to-date data on the impact of DPP-4i, SGLT2i, and GLP-1 RAs on biochemical and/or histological markers of NAFLD/NASH. The potential clinical implications of these findings in daily practice are also discussed.

This probe demonstrates increased tumor specificity, compared to existing tumor-specific PET probes (F-FET, C-MET, and F-FDG). Evaluation of probes by in vivo PET imaging, F-FIMP showed intense accumulation in LAT1-positive tumor tissues, but not in inflamed lesions, whereas intense accumulation of F-FDG was observed in both tumor tissues and in inflamed lesions. Metabolite analysis showed that F-FIMP was stable in liver microsomes, and mice tissues (plasma, urine, liver, pancreas, and tumor). Investigation of the protein incorporation of F-FIMP showed that it was not incorporated into protein. Furthermore, the expected mean absorbed dose of F-FIMP in humans was comparable or slightly higher than that of F-FDG and indicated that F-FIMP may be a safe PET probe for use in humans. F-FIMP may provide improved specificity for tumor diagnosis, compared to F-FDG, F-FET, and C-MET.

We hypothesized that direct activation would cause rapid neoplasia and cancer progression. Pbsn-cre4Prb;PI3K mice develop widespread prostate intraepithelial hyperplasia, but stromal invasion is limited and overall progression is slower than anticipated. However, the model produced profound and progressive stromal remodeling prior to explicit epithelial neoplasia. Increased stromal cellularity and inflammatory infiltrate are evident as early as 4 months of age and progressively increase through 12 months of age, the terminal endpoint of this study. Prostatic collagen density and phosphorylated SMAD2-positive prostatic stromal cells are expansive and accumulate with age, consistent with pro-fibrotic TGFβ pathway activation. Few reported mouse models accumulate prostate-specific collagen to the degree observed in Pbsn-cre4Prb;PI3K . Our results indicate a signaling process beginning with prostatic epithelial PI3K and TGFβ signaling that drives prostatic stromal hypertrophy and collagen accumulation.

High rates of mortality and tissue damage have been reported in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis. Bovine lactoferrin (BLF) is a well-known 80-kDa glycoprotein in the transferrin family that inhibits sepsis in low-birth-weight neonates. The present study investigated the protective effects of BLF in a rat model of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). The wet/dry ratio, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant markers, total protein, total cell count, inflammatory markers and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels were assessed. Histopathological analysis was also carried out. BLF treatment reduced the wet/dry ratio of lung tissue by 30.7% and 61.3%, and lipid peroxidation by 22.3% and 67%, at concentrations of 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) and catalase were increased by more than 50% under treatment with 200 mg/kg BLF. Inflammatory markers, neutrophils, lymphocytes and total cell count were reduced by more than 50% under treatment with 200 mg/kg BLF. BLF treatment significantly reduced MPO activity, by 28.2% and 74.3%, at concentrations of 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively. Neutrophilic infiltration and edema were observed in control rats. However, BLF treatment restored intestinal microvilli to the normal range and reduced inflammatory cell invasion.

Quercetin is known for its anti-allergic properties but its effects on conjunctivitis are less well understood.In this study, we evaluated the anti-allergic effects of quercetin in animal models of conjunctivitis, and explored its molecular mechanism(s) of action in cultured human mast cells (MCs).Quercetin inhibited the ovalbumin (OVA) induced expression of IgE, HA, IL-4, TNF-α and substance-P in the peripheral blood of AC mouse models. Quercetin also attenuated OVA induced MC degranulation, eosinophil number, substance P concentrations, and mRNA IL-4/TNF-α expression in the conjunctival tissue of AC models. In vitro analysis showed that quercetin reduced DNP-HSA/IgE induced calcium (Ca2+) influx, and suppressed degranulation and chemokine release in LAD2 cells (human primary mast cell). Quercetin also inhibited DNP-HSA/IgE induced Lyn/PLCγ/IP3R-Ca2+ activation, Lyn/ERK1/2 signaling, and Lyn/NF-κB activation in LAD2 cells, all of which promote . When added alone, quercetin had no effect on PLCγ1 phosphorylation or expression, but potently inhibited Lyn and phosphorylation-Lyn. Quercetin (200 μM) and Lyn inhibitors (Bafetinib, 10 μM) inhibit the activity of Lyn kinase, and quercetin can reduce the activation of Lyn kinase by Lyn agonist (Tolimidone, 10 μM). These data can be preliminarily determined that quercetin can inhibit allergic conjunctivitis as a Lyn kinase inhibitor.This study illustrated the use of quercetin for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis, which might act through its ability to inhibit Lyn/PLCγ/IP3R-Ca, Lyn/ERK1/2, and Lyn/NF-κB signaling. The inhibition of Lyn likely represents a major mechanism by which quercetin dampens the inflammatory response in AC disease models.Copyright © 2019.

We have recently shown that IL-6 inhibition by tocilizumab attenuates systemic  and troponin T-release in patients with acute non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI). Experimental studies suggest that IL-6 inhibition can limit infarct size through anti-inflammatory mechanisms, but this has not been tested in clinical studies. With the essing the effect of nti--6 treatment in  (ASSAIL-MI) trial, we aim to examine whether a single administration of the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab can increase myocardial salvage in patients with acute ST-elevation MI (STEMI).The ASSAIL-MI trial is a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial, conducted at three high-volume percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) centres in Norway. 200 patients with first-time STEMI presenting within 6 hours of the onset of chest pain will be randomised to receive tocilizumab or matching placebo prior to PCI. The patients are followed-up for 6 months. The primary endpoint is the myocardial salvage index measured by cardiac MRI (CMR) 3-7 days after the intervention. Secondary endpoints include final infarct size measured by CMR and plasma markers of myocardial necrosis.

The current study was performed to evaluate a large-animal model employing implanted optical fibers to accurately irradiate targeted spinal segments. The method's feasibility and irradiation parameters that do not cause phototoxic reaction were determined, and the methodology of irradiating the spinal cord with near-infrared light was investigated in detail.A diffusing optical fiber was implanted above the T9 spinal cord of Bama miniature pigs and used to transfer near-infrared light (810 nm) onto the spinal cord surface. After daily irradiation with 200, 300, 500, or 1000 mW for 14 days, both sides of the irradiated area of the spinal cord were assessed for temperature changes. The condition of the spinal cord and the position of optical fiber were investigated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and different parameters indicating temperature increases or phototoxicity were measured on the normal spinal cord surface due to light irradiation (i.e., heat shock responses, inflammatory reactions, and neuronal apoptosis), and the animals' lower-limb neurological function and gait were assessed during the irradiation process.The implanted device was stable inside the freely moving animals, and light energy could be directly projected onto the spinal cord surface. The screening of different irradiation parameters preliminary showed that direct irradiation onto the spinal cord surface at 200 and 300 mW did not significantly increase the temperature, stress responses, inflammatory reactions and neural apoptosis, whereas irradiation at 500 mW slightly increased these parameters, and irradiation at 1000 mW induced a significant temperature increase, heat shock,  and apoptosis responses. HE staining of spinal cord tissue sections did not reveal any significant structural changes of the tissues compared to the control group, and the neurological function and gait of all irradiated animals were normal.In this study, we established an in-vivo optical fiber implantation method, which might be safe and stable and could be used to directly project light energy onto the spinal cord surface. This study might provide a new perspective for clinical applications of PBM in acute SCI. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.This article is protected by copyright.

Biosynthesized gold nanoparticles are the ideal alternatives spotlighted by many researchers to treat various diseases. In the present study we synthesized gold nanoparticles using the root extract of Paeonia mountan, woody trees which are used in traditional Chinese medicine to be prescribed for diverse diseases. The synthesis of gold nanoparticles was confirmed with UV-Vis spectroscopic analysis and characterized using FTIR, HR-TEM, EDAX and XRD analysis. The cytotoxicity property of synthesized gold nanoparticles was assessed using MTT assay in the murine microglial BV2 cells. The neuroprotective effect of synthesized gold nanoparticles in inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharides triggered murine microglial BV2 cells was evaluated using nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2 and inflammatory cytokines assays such as IL-6&IL-1β. Further to confirm in vivo effect of synthesized nanoparticles, the nanoparticles were treated to Parkinson induced C57BL/6 mice. Behavioral, biochemical and molecular analysis were performed to estimate the potency of synthesized gold nanoparticles against the Parkinson induction in mice model. Our characterization results prove the gold nanoparticles synthesized using Paeonia mountan fulfills the requirement of ideal nanodrug and it potentially inhibited the  in in vitro murine microglial BV2.

The anti-inflammatory effects of baicalin have been proposed in a mouse model of experimental sepsis. Here, we investigated its protective effects and associated mechanisms with respect to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced injury in Caenorhabditis elegans.Worms were stimulated by LPS (100 μg/mL), with baicalin (1, 10, 100 μmol/L), for 24 h. Animal survival rates and behaviors (reversal and omega turn) were then determined. Further, levels of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-1, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Western blotting was also performed to determine the protein expression levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), Bax, and Bcl-2. The activities of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) contents were determined using corresponding kits.Baicalin (10, 100 μmol/L) improved LPS-stimulated C. elegans survival and rescued behavioral phenotypes. It also suppressed the oxidative stress related to LPS injury by decreasing MDA levels and increasing SOD activity. Moreover, the inflammatory response was inhibited as evidenced by decreased levels of cytokines including IL-6, IL-1, and TNF-α. In addition, baicalin treatment significantly decreased cleaved Bax levels and increased Bcl-2 expression in C. elegans treated with LPS. Simultaneously, the expression of NF-κB and TLR4 was significantly decreased.Baicalin treatment protects against LPS-induced injury by decreasing oxidative stress, repressing the inflammatory cascade, and inhibiting apoptosis.© 2019 S.

Taking into account the disturbances in protein glycosylation and the emerging new treatment regimens, the aim of this study was to assess the serum profile of transferrin isoforms in RA patients treated with biological drugs.The study included 20 patients (16 females and 4 males; mean age: 53.4 years; range: 24-67) with rheumatoid arthritis treated with rituximab. Serum samples were taken 3 times: before and 3 and 6 months during treatment. The isoforms of transferrin were separated by capillary electrophoresis (MINICAP electrophoretic system, Sebia, France) into five major fractions: asialo-, disialo-, trisialo-, tetrasialo- and pentasialotransferrin. The results were calculated as relative concentrations of each fraction.The median trisialotransferrin relative concentrations after 3 and 6 months treatment (4.40% and 4.10%, respectively) were significantly higher (p=0.013, p=0.009, respectively) than before treatment (3.50%). The levels of serum pentasialotransferrin were also increased 3 and 6 months following treatment (16.5% and 17.7%, p=0.005 and p=0.006, respectively) as compared to those before therapy (14.5%), while tetrasialotransferrin concentrations were lower (80.3% and 78.4%, p=0.009 and p=0.008, respectively) than before treatment (81.5%). Trisialotransferrin relative concentration correlated with Hb (p=0.019), whereas pentasialotransferrin with PLT (p=0.036) after treatment.This study indicates that treatment with rituximab of RA patients alters the serum profile of transferrin isoforms. Tri-, tetra- and pentasialotransferrin relative concentrations measurements can be a useful tool to monitor therapy.Copyright © 2019 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

They contribute to the regulation of a variety of physiologic processes including embryonic development, differentiation and proliferation, apoptosis, metabolism, hemostasis and . In addition, aberrant miRNA expression is implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases including cancer, hepatitis, cardiovascular diseases and metabolic diseases. Steroid hormones regulate virtually every aspect of metabolism and acute and chronic steroid hormone biosynthesis is primarily regulated by tissue-specific trophic hormones involving transcriptional and translational events. In addition, it is becoming increasingly clear that steroidogenic pathways are also subject to post-transcriptional and post-translational regulations including processes such as phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, and protein‒protein interactions and regulation by specific miRNAs, although the latter is in its infancy state. Here, we summarize the recent advances in miRNA-mediated regulation of steroidogenesis with emphasis on adrenal and gonadal steroidogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674784>L-Arabinose inhibits colitis by modulating gut microbiota in mice.</a></h1><p>L-Arabinose is a monosaccharide extracted from plants or fibers, which is known to have a variety of functional properties. In this study, we aim to investigate whether L-Arabinose could inhibit colitis by modulating gut microbiota. L-Arabinose was administrated in mice daily in a DSS-induced colitis model. The histological analysis, disease index and the expression of inflammatory genes were measured. 16S-rRNA sequence analysis was performed to investigate gut microbiota. Intriguingly, we found that L-Arabinose could repress DSS-induced colitis and inhibit p38-/p65-dependent  activation. Besides that, our data revealed that L-Arabinose modulated gut microbiota disturbed by DSS treatment. Additionally, by antibiotic treatment, the perturbed gut microbiota was responsible for the suppressive effects of L-Arabinose on DSS-induced colitis. Lastly, Caco-2 cells was used to confirm the protective effects of L-Arabinose. As expected, the expression levels of pro-inflammatory proteins in Caco-2 cells treated with L-Arabinose in absence or presence of TNFα. Our work suggested that L-Arabinose exert anti- effect in DSS-induced colitis. These beneficial effects may be related to the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota regulated by L-Arabinose. L-Arabinose could be a remarkable candidate as a functional food or novel therapeutic strategies for intestinal health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670284>Magnesium sulfate attenuates lipopolysaccharides-induced acute lung injury in mice.</a></h1><p>Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common and severe respiratory disease with high morbidity and mortality. Although some progress has been made in the past years, the pathogenesis of ALI is still poorly understood and the therapeutic outcome has still not been significantly improved. It is well-recognized that magnesium sulfate (MgSO) possesses potent anti- capacity. The present study was designed to investigate the protective effects of MgSO in lipopolysaccharides (LPSs)-induced ALI taken into account that excessive inflammatory response plays critical role in the development of ALI. In this study, Kunming mice were intravenously injected with LPS through tail vein to establish the ALI model and in parallel, A549 cells were used to establish cell model. The lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in lung tissue, lung permeability index, hematoxylin and eosin staining, cytokines in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), neutrophil counts in BALF, LPS-induced A549 cell apoptosis as well as apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) expression in both mice and A549 cells were detected. Our results demonstrated that MgSO significantly attenuated the LPS-induced ALI, oxidative stress (decreased MDA levels), and lung inflammatory response. Moreover, MgSO exerted protective effects by mitigating LPS-induced A549 cell apoptosis. Furthermore, MgSO decreased the AIF and PARP-1 expression both in vivo and in vitro. Our results, taken together, demonstrated that MgSO is a potential therapeutic agent for ALI taken into consideration that MgSO is commonly used in clinical settings.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670253>Silk peptide production from whole silkworm cocoon using ultrasound and enzymatic treatment and its suppression of solar ultraviolet-induced skin .</a></h1><p>Silk fibroin, which is derived from sericin through degumming, is mainly used as a biomaterial. However, interest in functional verification and industrial applications of sericin has been growing for several years. We used ultrasonication to simplify the extraction process of the silk peptide under low salt conditions at 20 °C, instead of using the conventional conditions of high salt and temperature. The concentration of the silk peptide was measured to determine the optimized extraction time and solvent, which were 4 h and 0.1 N NaOH, respectively. The molecular weight of the enzyme-treated silk peptide was measured using SDS-PAGE and GPC. Silk peptide treated with papain after ultrasound had a molecular weight of less than 5 kDa, and the papain treated-silk peptide reduced solar ultraviolet-induced COX-2 expression through inhibition of ERK phosphorylation. This is the first study investigating simultaneous extraction of fibroin and sericin, which can be used for mass production of food materials.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The detection of H2Sn in living systems is essential, but further understanding of its "intact" function in living cells has been limited, owing to the lack of appropriate analytical tools. In this work, a new fluorescent probe PP-PS was designed for the detection of endogenous H2Sn. The probe has a large Stokes shift (178 nm), low detection limit (1 nM), and short response time (1 minute). Besides, PP-PS was successfully applied in the imaging of endogenous H2Sn in lysosomes of living cancer cells, xenograft mouse tumor tissues, and LPS-induced mouse  tissues. These results revealed that the probe PP-PS could act as a new fluorescence imaging tool to study the function of intracellular hydropolysulfides.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671005>Ocular  and Choroidal Thickness after Pars Plana Vitrectomy in Chronic Recurrent Stage of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease.</a></h1><p>: To evaluate subfoveal choroidal thickness (SCT) changes and ocular  after pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) in Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease.: We analyzed best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), ocular , complications, and SCT in 17 eyes of 14 patients with VKH disease who underwent PPV and had ≥12-month follow-up.

The highly metabolically active cells of the renal tubule also pair their energetic needs to the regulation of diverse cellular processes, including energy generation, antioxidant responses, autophagy and mitochondrial quality control. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is essential not only for the harvesting of energy from substrates but also for an array of regulatory reactions that determine cellular health. In acute kidney injury (AKI), substantial decreases in the levels of NAD impair energy generation and, ultimately, the core kidney function of selective solute transport. Conversely, augmentation of NAD may protect the kidney tubule against diverse acute stressors. For example, NAD augmentation can ameliorate experimental AKI triggered by ischaemia-reperfusion, toxic injury and systemic . NAD-dependent maintenance of renal tubular metabolic health may also attenuate long-term profibrotic responses that could lead to chronic kidney disease. Further understanding of the genetic, environmental and nutritional factors that influence NAD biosynthesis and renal resilience may lead to novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of kidney disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670864>NF-E2-related factor 2 activation boosts antioxidant defenses and ameliorates inflammatory and amyloid properties in human Presenilin-1 mutated Alzheimer's disease astrocytes.</a></h1><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common dementia affecting a vast number of individuals and significantly impairing quality of life. Despite extensive research in animal models and numerous promising treatment trials, there is still no curative treatment for AD. Astrocytes, the most common cell type of the central nervous system, have been shown to play a role in the major AD pathologies, including accumulation of amyloid plaques, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. Here, we show that inflammatory stimulation leads to metabolic activation of human astrocytes and reduces amyloid secretion. On the other hand, the activation of oxidative metabolism leads to increased reactive oxygen species production especially in AD astrocytes. While healthy astrocytes increase glutathione (GSH) release to protect the cells, Presenilin-1-mutated AD patient astrocytes do not. Thus, chronic  is likely to induce oxidative damage in AD astrocytes. Activation of NRF2, the major regulator of cellular antioxidant defenses, encoded by the NFE2L2 gene, poses several beneficial effects on AD astrocytes. We report here that the activation of NRF2 pathway reduces amyloid secretion, normalizes cytokine release, and increases GSH secretion in AD astrocytes. NRF2 induction also activates the metabolism of astrocytes and increases the utilization of glycolysis. Taken together, targeting NRF2 in astrocytes could be a potent therapeutic strategy in AD.© 2019 The Authors.

Severe bacterial infections causing sepsis always result in profound physiological changes, including fever, hypotension, arrhythmia, necrosis of tissue, systemic multi-organ dysfunction and finally death. LPS challenge-induced inflammatory responses during sepsis may increase the likelihood of the arrhythmogenesis. Lemnalol is known to possess potent anti-inflammatory effects. This study examined whether Lemnalol (0.1 μM) could modulate the electrophysiological characteristics and calcium homeostasis of atrial myocytes under the influence of LPS (1μg/mL). Under challenge with LPS, Lemnalol-treated LA myocytes, had a longer AP duration at 20%, 50% and 90% repolarization of the amplitude, compared to the LPS-treated cells. LPS-challenged LA myocytes showed increased late sodium current, Na-Ca exchanger current, transient outward current, rapid component of delayed rectifier potassium current, tumor necrosis factor-α, NF-κB and increased phosphorylation of ryanodine receptor (RyR), but a lower L-type Ca current than the control LA myocytes. Exposure to Lemnalol reversed the LPS-induced effects. The LPS-treated and control groups of LA myocytes, with or without the existence of Lemnalol. showed no apparent alterations in the sodium current amplitude or Cav1.2 expression. The expression of sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium transport ATPase (SERCA2) was reduced by LPS treatment, while Lemnalol ameliorated the LPS-induced alterations. The phosphorylation of RyR was enhanced by LPS treatment, while Lemnalol attenuated the LPS-induced alterations. In conclusion, Lemnalol modulates LPS-induced alterations of LA calcium homeostasis and blocks the NF-κB pathways, which may contribute to the attenuation of LPS-induced arrhythmogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672903>Novel evidence for a greater burden of ambient air pollution on cardiovascular disease.</a></h1><p>Ambient and household air pollution is a major health problem, contributing globally and annually to approximately 7 millions of all-cause avoidable deaths, shortening of life expectancy and significant direct and indirect costs for the community. Air pollution is a complex mixture of gaseous and particulate materials, that vary depending on their source and physicochemical features. Each material has detrimental effects on human health, but a number of experimental and clinical studies have shown a strong impact for fine particulate matter (PM2.5). In particular, there is more and more evidence that PM2.5 exerts adverse effects particularly on the cardiovascular system, contributing substantially -- mainly through mechanisms of atherosclerosis, thrombosis and  -- to coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease, but also to heart failure, hypertension, diabetes and cardiac arrhythmias. In this review, we summarize knowledge on the mechanisms and magnitude of the cardiovascular adverse effects of short- and long-term exposure to ambient air pollution, particularly for the PM2.5 size fraction. We also emphasize that very recent data indicate that the global mortality and morbidity burden of cardiovascular disease associated with this air pollutant is dramatically greater than appreciated until now.Copyright © 2019, Ferrata Storti Foundation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672283>Insight into interleukin-37: The potential therapeutic target in allergic diseases.</a></h1><p>Allergic diseases are ubiquitous diseases with detrimental effects on the quality of life of people worldwide. Common allergic diseases include asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR) and allergic dermatitis (AD). Recently, studies have shown that interleukin (IL)-37, a novel cytokine in the IL-1 family, exhibits broad protective properties in various diseases, such as autoimmune diseases and cancer. IL-37 displays its anti-inflammatory effect on diseases by curbing innate and acquired immunity as well as inﬂammatory reactions. IL-37 functions by forming a complex with IL-18Rα and IL-1R8 extracellularly and can be translocated to the nucleus upon forming a complex with mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (Smad3) intracellularly, thereby affecting gene transcription and signaling pathway activation. In addition, increasing evidence confirms that IL-37 expression is aberrant in asthma, AR and AD, which indicates that IL-37 may also play essential roles in allergic diseases. Furthermore, accumulating data obtained from recombinant IL-37 (rIL-37)-treated mice and from IL-37 transgenic (IL-37tg) mice suggest a protective role for IL-37. This review will detail the role of IL-37 in the occurrence and development of allergic diseases and discuss the potential of IL-37 as a therapeutic target in allergic diseases.Copyright © 2019.

ITGAM encodes the α chain of the β integrin Mac-1, a receptor that plays important roles in myeloid cell functions. The ITGAM SNP rs1143679, which results in an arginine to histidine change at amino acid position 77 of the CD11b protein, has been shown to reduce binding to several ligands and to alter Mac-1-mediated cellular response in vitro. Importantly, however, the potential contribution of this SNP variant to the initiation and/or progression of immune and inflammatory processes in vivo remains unexplored. Herein, we describe for the first time the generation and characterization of a mouse line expressing the 77His variant of CD11b. Surprisingly, we found that 77His did not significantly affect Mac-1-mediated leukocyte migration and activation as assessed using thioglycollate-induced peritonitis and LPS/TNF-α-induced dermal  models. In contrast, expression of this variant did alter T cell immunity, as evidenced by significantly reduced proliferation of ovalbumin (OVA)-specific transgenic T cells in 77His mice immunized with OVA. Reduced antigen-specific T cell proliferation was also observed when either 77His splenic dendritic cells (DCs) or bone marrow-derived DCs were used as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Although more work is necessary to determine how this alteration might influence the development of SLE or other diseases, these in vivo findings suggest that the 77His variant of CD11b can compromise the ability of DCs to induce antigen-driven T cell proliferation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671832>Akt1 and Akt2 Isoforms Play Distinct Roles in Regulating the Development of  and Fibrosis Associated with Alcoholic Liver Disease.</a></h1><p>Akt kinase isoforms (Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3) have generally been thought to play overlapping roles in phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-mediated-signaling. However, recent studies have suggested that they display isoform-specific roles in muscle and fat. To determine whether such isoform-specificity is observed with respect to alcoholic liver disease (ALD) progression, we examined the role of Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3 in hepatic , and pro-fibrogenic proliferation and migration using Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells (HSC), and hepatocytes in an ethanol and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced two-hit model in vitro and in vivo. We determined that siRNA-directed silencing of Akt2, but not Akt1, significantly suppressed cell inflammatory markers in HSC and Kupffer cells. Although both Akt1 and Akt2 inhibited cell proliferation in HSC, only Akt2 inhibited cell migration. Both Akt1 and Akt2, but not Akt3, inhibited fibrogenesis in hepatocytes and HSC. In addition, our in vivo results show that administration of chronic ethanol, binge ethanol and LPS (EBL) in wild-type C57BL/6 mice activated all three Akt isoforms with concomitant increases in activated forms of phosphoinositide dependent kinase-1 (PDK1), mammalian target-of-rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), and PI3K, resulting in upregulation in expression of inflammatory, proliferative, and fibrogenic genes. Moreover, pharmacological blocking of Akt2, but not Akt1, inhibited EBL-induced  while blocking of both Akt1 and Akt2 inhibited pro-fibrogenic marker expression and progression of fibrosis. Our findings indicate that Akt isoforms play unique roles in , cell proliferation, migration, and fibrogenesis during EBL-induced liver injury.

Disorders of lipid metabolism initiate an inflammatory and immune-mediated response in atherosclerosis, while low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering has possible pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects that extend beyond lipid lowering.Activation of the immune system/inflammasome destabilizes the plaque, which makes it vulnerable to rupture, resulting in major adverse cardiac events (MACE). The activated immune system potentially accelerates atherosclerosis, and atherosclerosis activates the immune system, creating a vicious circle. LDL-C enhances , which can be measured through multiple parameters like high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). However, multiple studies have shown that CRP is a marker of residual risk and not, itself, a causal factor. Recently, anti-inflammatory therapy has been shown to decelerate atherosclerosis, resulting in fewer MACE.

This synthetic pyrazolone derivative is a potent scavenger of oxygen free radicals and also functions as a modulator of transcription factors, repressing NFκB and activating Nrf2, to regulate oxidative stress. EDA displays complementary anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. The injectable small molecule is currently investigated for the treatment of several non-neurological diseases. The potential interest of EDA in oncology is reviewed here. EDA is a mild antiproliferative agent but has been found to enhance significantly the anticancer and antimetastatic activities of irinotecan in a colon cancer model. Anticancer derivatives of EDA have been designed but they generally display a limited antiproliferative activity. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of EDA can be best exploited to protect non-tumor cells from damages induced by chemotherapeutic drugs and radiations. Notably EDA can reduce the renal dysfunction induced by cisplatin, the neurotoxicity of cyclophosphamide and the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin. Upon treatment with EDA, a significant improvement in neurologic symptoms has been observed in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy. The drug could be used to limit radiation-induced brain injury or oral mucositis. EDA was found to ameliorate autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis), which is a frequent side effect observed after treatment of cancer patients with monoclonal antibodies targeting the immune checkpoint PD-1. Therefore, EDA could also be useful to reduce specific side effects of immuno-therapy. Collectively, the information suggests that the medical use of EDA, a drug with a proven safety after 18 years of use in brain-related Human diseases, could be extended to cancer-related conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Identification of novel target genes and mechanisms that regulate adipocyte function could lead to improved treatment strategies. RND3 (RhoE/Rho8), a Rho-related GTP-binding protein that inhibits Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling, has been linked to diverse diseases such as apoptotic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cancer and type 2 diabetes, in part by regulating cytoskeleton dynamics and insulin-mediated glucose uptake.We here investigated the expression of RND3 in adipose tissue in human obesity, and discovered a role for RND3 in regulating adipocyte metabolism. In cross-sectional and prospective studies, we observed 5-fold increased adipocyte levels of RND3 mRNA in obesity, reduced levels after surgery-induced weight loss, and positive correlations of RND3 mRNA with adipocyte size and surrogate measures of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR and circulating triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TAG/HDL-C) ratio). By screening for RND3-dependent gene expression following siRNA-mediated RND3 knockdown in differentiating human adipocytes, we found downregulation of inflammatory genes and upregulation of genes related to adipocyte lipolysis and insulin signaling. Treatment of adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hypoxia or cAMP analogs increased RND3 mRNA levels 1.5-2-fold. Functional assays in primary human adipocytes confirmed that RND3 knockdown reduces cAMP- and isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, which were mimicked by treating cells with ROCK inhibitor. This effect could partly be explained by reduced protein expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).We here uncovered a novel differential expression of adipose RND3 in obesity and insulin resistance, which may at least partly depend on a causal effect of RND3 on adipocyte lipolysis.Copyright © 2019.

Recent studies have shown that extracellular vesicles (EVs) from Gram-negative periodontal pathogens, so-called outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), harbor various effector molecules responsible for inducing host inflammatory responses. However, there are no reports of EVs from F. alocis. In this study, we purified and characterized the protein profiles of EVs from F. alocis and investigated their immunostimulatory activity on human monocytic THP-1 and human oral keratinocyte HOK-16B cell lines. Highly pure EVs were obtained from F. alocis using density gradient ultracentrifugation. Nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy showed that F. alocis EVs were between 50 nm and 270 nm in diameter. Proteome analysis identified 28 proteins, including lipoproteins, autolysins, F. alocis complement inhibitor (FACIN), transporter-related proteins, metabolism-related proteins, and ribosomal proteins. Human cytokine array analysis showed that F. alocis EVs remarkably induced the expression of CCL1, CCL2, MIP-1, CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL10, ICAM-1, IL-1β, IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-8, MIF, SerpinE, and TNF-α in THP-1 cells and CXCL1, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-6, and IL-8 in HOK-16B cells. The immunostimulatory activity of F. alocis EVs was similar to that of the whole bacterial cells. Our findings provide new insight into the role of EVs from Gram-positive oral bacteria in periodontal diseases.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

LSM was compared in patients with normal total bilirubin (TB) versus abnormal TB for each group of fibrosis stage, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and  grade. Logistic regression and ROC analyses were performed to assess the benefit of adding TB and to LSM for fibrosis staging.Nine hundred and seventy-three patients were analyzed. Within the same fibrosis stage, LSMs showed significantly higher value in patients with abnormal TB than those with normal TB. Increased LSM for abnormal TB was generally found within different sub-groups of patients (≤ F2 or ≥ F3; ALT < 2 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALT ≥ 2 × ULN; METAVIR activity grade ≤ 1 or ≥ 2). Patients with abnormal TB level showed higher optimal cutoff values: 10.46 kPa for ≥ F2, 10.94 kPa for ≥ F3, and 15.88 kPa for F4, than those with normal TB (7.62 kPa, 8.26 kPa, and 11.01 kPa, respectively). LSM assessed fibrosis stage (≥ F2, ≥ F3, F4) showed higher false positive rate in patients with abnormal TB level (44.6%, 45.1%, 39.6%) than those with normal TB (20.7%, 17.1%, 14.4%). However, the area under the ROC curve did not change appreciably when adding TB to LSM for fibrosis stage.Intrahepatic cholestasis showed slight effect on LSM in patients with CHB, also leading to overestimation of liver fibrosis stages. But adding TB level to LSM did not improve the overall diagnostic performance of liver fibrosis stage.• Intrahepatic cholestasis showed slight effect on liver stiffness measurements (LSMs) in chronic HBV patients. • Patients with abnormal total bilirubin (TB) level showed higher optimal cutoff values and false positive rate. • When taking into account intrahepatic cholestasis, the diagnostic performance of LSM for liver fibrosis staging in patients with chronic HBV infection will not improve.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675274>Relevant Features in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Determined Using Machine Learning for Feature Selection.</a></h1><p> We investigated the prevalence and the most relevant features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a stage of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, (NAFLD) in which the  of hepatocytes can lead to increased cardiovascular risk, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and the need for liver transplant.  We analyzed data from 2239 hypertensive patients using descriptive statistics and supervised machine learning algorithms, including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and random forest classifier, to select the most relevant features of NASH.  The prevalence of NASH among our hypertensive patients was 11.3%. In univariate analyses, it was associated with metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Ferritin and serum insulin were the most relevant features in the final model, with a sensitivity of 70%, specificity of 79%, and area under the curve of 0.79.

We aimed to clarify where TUS training opportunities currently exist for respiratory registrars.Data were collected (over a 4-week period) to clarify the number of scans (and therefore volume of training opportunities) within radiology departments and respiratory services in hospitals in the South West, North West deaneries and Oxford.14 hospitals (including three tertiary pleural centres) provided data. Of 964 scans, 793 (82.3%) were conducted by respiratory teams who performed a mean of 17.7 scans per week, versus 3.1 TUS/week in radiology departments. There was no radiology session in any hospital with ≥5 TUS performed, whereas 8/14 (86%) of respiratory departments conducted such sessions. Almost half (6/14) of radiology departments conducted no TUS scans in the period surveyed.The currently recommended exposure of regularly attending a list or session to undertake five TUS is not achievable in radiology departments. The greatest volume of training opportunities exists within respiratory departments in a variety of scheduled and unscheduled settings.

Benzoinum, a resin secreted from the bark of , has been widely used as a form of traditional Chinese medicine in clinical settings to enhance cardiovascular function, but the active components of the resin responsible for those pharmaceutical effects remain unclear. To better clarify these components, a new phenylpropane derivative termed stybenpropol A was isolated from benzoinum and characterized via comprehensive spectra a nalysis. We further assessed how this phenylpropane derivative affected treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Our results revealed that stybenpropol A reduced soluble intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) expression by ELISA, inhibited apoptosis, and accelerated nitric oxide (NO) release in TNF-α-treated HUVECs. We further found that stybenpropol A decreased VCAM-1, ICAM-1, Bax, and caspase-9 protein levels, and increased the protein levels of Bcl-2, IKK-β, and IκB-α.

Currently, there are no reliable biomarkers or effective therapeutic options established for NAFLD. Nevertheless, there are several molecular targets in the pipeline, of which fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is one. FGF21 is secreted primarily from liver and has a plethora of metabolic functions. Pre-clinical and epidemiological studies indicate a relationship between circulating FGF21 levels and hepatic fat content in both mice and humans. Moreover, animal studies have clearly shown that aberrant FGF21 signalling is a key pathological step in the development and progression of NAFLD. A recent Phase II clinical trial demonstrated that administration of an FGF21 analogue significantly reduced hepatic fat in subjects with NASH. As such, FGF21 provides a novel target for future biomarker and therapeutic studies. This review appraises preclinical data to outline the current understanding of FGF21 function in both normal hepatic function and NAFLD. Epidemiological evidence is explored to delineate the relationship between circulating FGF21 levels and NAFLD in humans. Finally, we review the therapeutic effects of FGF21 in the treatment of NAFLD.Copyright © 2019.

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and bisphenols (A [BPA], Tetrabromobisphenol A [TBBPA], and 2,4,6-Tribromophenol [TBP]) are common environmental pollutants known to increase the risk for spontaneous preterm birth (PTB). We hypothesized that placental exposure to these environmental pollutants causes exosome cargo changes that reflect exposure associated placental response.Full-term, C-section placenta explants were treated with PBDE congeners (47, 100, 153, 209), TBBPA, TBP or BPA for 24 h. Exosomes were isolated from media by sequential ultracentrifugation and purified by size exclusion chromatography. Exosomes were characterized by electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis and Western blot. Proteomics identified differentially expressed exosomal proteins and Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) determined biological functions and pathways represented by identified proteins.Regardless of treatment, placental expressed exosomes markers (PLAP, CD9, CD63, 81 and ALIX), had a size distribution between 50 and 175 nm and were present in the conditioned medium at 5-8 x 10 exosomes/mL. Proteomic analysis identified 2598 proteins which demonstrated that specific pollutants caused differential expression of specific proteins, including alarmin, High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1), MAPK14 (p38 MAPK) and GSK3β. IPA revealed an inhibition of pathways associated with cell survival, tissue repair and proliferation, as well as activation of cell death pathways (e.g. necrosis).Environmental exposure of placental explants did not change the quantity of exosomes or their characteristics.

Gut microbiota play pivotal roles in mediating psychological behaviors by regulating gut barrier integrity and systemic inflammatory responses. Here, we found that oral sesamin administration (50 mg/kg·bodyweight/day) significantly attenuated depressive, aversive, repetitive, and anxiety-like behaviors in a long-term multiple nonsocial stress-treated mice model. Sesamin inhibited stress-induced gut barrier integrity damage, reduced circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels, and suppressed neuroinflammatory responses. Moreover, sesamin treatment also restructured the gut microbiome by enhancing the relative abundances of Bacteroidales and S24-7. The correlation analysis indicated that the microbiota composition changes were strongly correlated with behavioral disorders, serotonin, norepinephrine, and LPS levels. In conclusion, sesamin has preventive effects on stress-induced behavioral and psychological disorders, which might be highly related to the reshaped microbiota composition. This study provides a clue for understanding the systemic mechanism of anti-depression effects of sesamin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670094>Genetic polymorphisms of IL-10, IL-18 and IL12B are associated with risk of non-small cell lung cancer in a Chinese Han population.</a></h1><p>IL-10, IL-18 and IL-12 are reported to participate in the  process. The potential influences of IL-10, IL-18 and IL-12 polymorphisms on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) risk were explored in this study.Six candidate SNPs from 500 NSCLC patients and 500 controls were genotyped. The correlation between the SNPs and NSCLC risk was evaluated by logistic regression analysis.Comparisons of the allele and genotype frequencies showed that five SNPs were correlated with NSCLC risk. The minor allele 'G' of IL-18 rs5744256 and rs1834481 and IL-10 rs3021094 was correlated with a decreased risk of NSCLC (p < 0.05). In contrast, the minor allele 'T' of IL-18 rs5744224 and the minor allele 'G' of IL-12B rs3212227 were correlated with an increased risk of NSCLC (p < 0.05). By genetic model analysis, we found that rs5744256 and rs1834481 were associated with a decreased risk of NSCLC under dominant and log-additive models (p < 0.05).

Female Wistar rats were divided into control, CYP (200 mg/kg), CYP+ITG (1.17 g/kg/day), and CYP+Daidzin (12.5 mg/kg/day) groups. We measured the voiding function by the transcystometrogram and evaluated the pathology with the hematoxylin and eosin and Masson stain. We determined the bladder reactive oxygen species (ROS) amount by an ultrasensitive chemiluminescence analyzer, the expression of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) by Western blot and the expression of multiple cytokine profiles, including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 through a cytokine array. ITG extract contains 1.07% of Daidzin through high-performance liquid chromatography.

CYP-induced higher urination frequency, shorter intercontraction interval, and lower maximal voiding pressure in the bladders and these symptoms were significantly ameliorated in CYP+ITG and CYP+Daidzin groups. The amount of in vivo bladder ROS and the expression of 3-NT and NOX4 expressions were significantly increased in CYP group but were efficiently decreased in the CYP+ITG and CYP+Daidzin groups. CYP-induced fibrosis, hemorrhage, leukocyte infiltration, and edema in the bladders were significantly attenuated in the CYP+ITG and CYP+Daidzin groups.

Limited evidence exists for the effectiveness of exercise for GTPS. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of isometric and isotonic exercise for individuals with GTPS.This randomised controlled pilot trial recruited 30 participants with GTPS. Both programmes consisted of daily, progressive home exercise for 12 weeks with 8 individual physiotherapy sessions over the trial period. The primary outcome measure was the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Gluteal (VISA-G) and secondary outcome measures included the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (0-10) and an 11-point Global Rating of Change Scale. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks.Twenty-three participants completed the trial. After 12 weeks, mean VISA-G scores improved in both groups; 55-65 in the isometric group and 62-72 in the isotonic group. 55% of the isometric group and 58% of the isotonic group achieved a reduction in pain of at least 2 points (minimally clinically important difference (MCID)) on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale. 64% of the isometric group and 75% of the isotonic group had improved by at least 2 points (MCID) on the Global Rating of Change Scale.Isometric and isotonic exercise programmes appear to be effective for individuals with GTPS and should be considered in the loading management of patients with this condition.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

This lack of benefit has been attributed to closure methods of the defect, with subsequent spinal cord tethering at the repair site. Hence, a regenerative patch or material with antiinflammatory and anti-scarring properties may alleviate comorbidities with improved outcomes. The authors' primary objective was therefore to compare cryopreserved human umbilical cord (HUC) versus acellular dermal matrix (ADM) patches for regenerative repair of in utero SB lesions in an animal model.In vivo studies were conducted in retinoic acid-induced SB defects in fetuses of Sprague-Dawley rats. HUC or ADM patches were sutured over the SB defects at a gestational age of 20 days. Repaired SB defect tissues were harvested after 48-52 hours. Tissue sections were immunofluorescently stained for the presence of neutrophils, macrophages, keratinocytes, meningeal cells, and astrocytes and for any associated apoptosis. In vitro meningeal or keratinocyte cell coculture experiments with the ADM and HUC patches were performed. All experiments were scored quantitatively in a blinded manner.Neutrophil counts and apoptotic cells were lower in the HUC-based repair group (n = 8) than in the ADM patch repair group (n = 7). In the HUC patch repair group, keratinocytes were present on the outer surface of the patch, meningeal cells were present on the inner surface of the patch adjacent to the neural placode, and astrocytes were noted to be absent. In the ADM patch repair group, all 3 cell types were present on both surfaces of the patch. In vitro studies showed that human meningeal cells grew preferentially on the mesenchymal side of the HUC patch, whereas keratinocytes showed tropism for the epithelial side, suggesting an inherent HUC-based cell polarity. In contrast, the ADM patch studies showed no polarity and decreased cellular infiltration.The HUC patch demonstrated reduced acute  and apoptosis together with superior organization in regenerative cellular growth when compared with the ADM patch, and is therefore likely the better patch material for in utero SB defect repair. These properties may make the HUC biomaterial useful as a "meningeal patch" during spinal cord surgeries, thereby potentially reducing tethering and improving on spinal cord function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671203>The role of Toll-like receptor 10 in modulation of trained immunity.</a></h1><p>Toll-like receptor 10 (TLR10) is the only member of the human Toll-like receptor family with an inhibitory function on the induction of innate immune responses and . However, its role in the modulation of trained immunity (innate immune memory) is unknown. In the present study, we assessed whether TLR10 modulates the induction of trained immunity induced by β-glucan or Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). IL-1Ra production was increased upon activation of TLR10 ex vivo after BCG vaccination, and TLR10 protein expression on monocytes was increased after BCG vaccination, while anti-TLR10 antibodies did not significantly modulate β-glucan or BCG-induced trained immunity in vitro. A known immunomodulatory TLR10 missense single nucleotide polymorphism (rs11096957) influenced trained immunity responses by β-glucan or BCG in vitro. However, the in vivo induction of trained immunity by BCG vaccination was not influenced by TLR10 polymorphisms.

However, it is unknown whether salt can induce proinflammatory priming of monocytes and macrophages in humans. We investigated the effects of salt on monocytes and macrophages in vitro and in vivo by performing a randomized crossover trial in which 11 healthy human subjects adhered to a 2-week low-salt and high-salt diet. We demonstrate that salt increases monocyte expression of CCR2, a chemokine receptor that mediates monocyte infiltration in inflammatory diseases. In line with this, we show a salt-induced increase of plasma MCP-1, transendothelial migration of monocytes, and skin macrophage density after high-salt diet. Macrophages demonstrate signs of an increased proinflammatory phenotype after salt exposure, as represented by boosted LPS-induced cytokine secretion of IL-6, TNF, and IL-10 in vitro, and by increased HLA-DR expression and decreased CD206 expression on skin macrophages after high-salt diet.

However, the tissue-specific factors controlling this dialogue remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that T cell responses to commensal colonization are associated with the development of organized cellular clusters within the skin epithelium. These organized lymphocyte clusters are surrounded by keratinocytes expressing a discrete program associated with antigen presentation and antimicrobial defense. Notably, IL-22-mediated keratinocyte-intrinsic MHC class II expression was required for the selective accumulation of commensal-induced IFN-γ, but not IL-17A-producing CD4 T cells within the skin. Taking these data together, this work uncovers an unexpected role for MHC class II expression by keratinocytes in the control of homeostatic type 1 responses to the microbiota.

A549 cells treated with FC-AE can triggered apoptosis. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of RNA-seq data showed that most of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were related to immune response, apoptosis and cell cycle process. Several immune and apoptotic DEGs were identified by qRT-PCR which were consistented with RNA-seq data. In nude mice, FC-AE reduced the tumor size and promoted the secretion of cytokines IL12 and IFNγ. FC-AE up-regulated the two members (STAT1 and STAT4) of STATs and their target genes (IFNγ and IL-12, respectively) protein expressions, and actively regulates Bcl-2/Bax family proteins which resulted in cellular apoptosis in A549 cells.Our finding suggests that FC-AE mediates apoptosis through a STAT1 and STAT4-mediated co-regulatory network, which may be the key novel mechanism for its antitumor activity. The F. cirrhosa may be a promising antitumor drug for modulating immune responses to improve cancer therapy.Copyright © 2019.

However, studies comparing PS and PG are rare and were mainly conducted with phospholipid-dispersions of large size and broad distributions. Thus, we prepared small-sized PS- and PG-loaded liposomes exhibiting narrow distribution, and additionally studied the impact of liposome-pegylation on the reduction of the TNFα-production caused by the PS- and PG-liposomes. These PS- and PG-containing nanodispersions had a small size around 100nm and a narrow distribution (PDI<0.1). The liposome-dispersions showed no toxicity in NHDF- and 3T3-cells and virtually no hemolytic activity. They decreased the TNFα-production of LPS-(lipopolysaccharide)-stimulated mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro. PG-liposomes always decreased the TNFα-levels more potently than PS-liposomes. Pegylation of PS- and PG-liposomes caused different Zeta potentials, but did not change biological activity. The results of the current study indicate a high potential of the tested formulations for phospholipid-based anti-inflammatory therapies.Copyright © 2019.

A central approach to molecular profiling consists of measuring DNA, RNA, and/or proteins in tissue samples, most notably in and around tumors. This measurement yields molecular biomarkers that are potentially predictive of response and of tumor type. Current methods in cancer therapy mostly use tissue biopsy as the starting point of molecular profiling. Tissue biopsies involve a physical resection of a small tissue sample, leading to localized tissue injury, bleeding,  and stress, as well as to an increased risk of metastasis. Here we developed a technology for harvesting biomolecules from tissues using electroporation. We show that tissue electroporation, achieved using a combination of high-voltage short pulses, 50 pulses 500 V cm, 30 µs, 1 Hz, with low-voltage long pulses 50 pulses 50 V cm, 10 ms, delivered at 1 Hz, allows for tissue-specific extraction of RNA and proteins. We specifically tested RNA and protein extraction from excised kidney and liver samples and from excised HepG2 tumors in mice. Further in vivo development of extraction methods based on electroporation can drive novel approaches to the molecular profiling of tumors and of tumor environment and to related diagnosis practices.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675449>Mycobacterium chelonae infection mimicking demodex folliculitis.</a></h1><p>A 69-year-old man was admitted to hospital with a three month history of a diffuse eruption of painful crusted erythematous papulopustular lesions involving the face and neck.

It is one of the most puzzling women malignancies, and it currently appears not to be a good candidate to a standardized, unanimously accepted and sufficiently active therapeutic strategy. Fast proliferating and poorly differentiated, it is histopathologically heterogeneous, and even more ambiguous at the molecular level, offering few recurrent actionable targets to the clinicians.

Studies have confirmed that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a key regulatory role in various inflammatory diseases. However, the miRNA-mediated mechanism of endometrial  induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) remains unclear. In this study, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence and Rac family small GTPase 1 (Rac1) interference were used to reveal the overexpression of miR-488 in the LPS-induced bovine uterus, and the effect of protein kinase B κ-light chain enhancement of the nuclear factor-activated B cells (AKT/NF-κB) pathway in intimal epithelial cells. The results showed that the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α in the experimental group was significantly lower than that in the control group when miR-488 was overexpressed. Similar results were observed in the expression levels of p-AKT, p-IKK, and p-p65 proteins. In addition, the dual-luciferase reporter system confirmed that miRNA-488 may directly target the 3'-untranslated region of Rac1. In turn, the expression of Rac1 was inhibited. Moreover, the nuclear translocation of NF-κB was inhibited, and meanwhile, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cells was reduced. Thus, we provide basic data for the negative regulation of miR-488 in LPS-induced  by inhibiting ROS production and the AKT/NF-kB pathway in intimal epithelial cells.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669854>A cationic Amphiphilic co-polymer as a carrier of nucleic acid nanoparticles (Nanps) for controlled gene silencing, Immunostimulation, and biodistribution.</a></h1><p>Programmable nucleic acid nanoparticles (NANPs) provide controlled coordination of therapeutic nucleic acids (TNAs) and other biological functionalities.

Polymeric platforms have proven to be efficient in shielding nucleic acid cargos from nuclease degradation while promoting their delivery and intracellular release. Here, we venture beyond the delivery of conventional TNAs and combine the stable cationic poly-(lactide-co-glycolide)-graft-polyethylenimine with functionalized NANPs. Furthermore, we compare several representative NANPs to assess how their overall structures influence their delivery with the same carrier.

The efficacy and molecular mechanisms in the presence or absence of TML were investigated.We demonstrated that treatment with TML aqueous extract protected the mice from acute lung injury induced by LPS administration. TML significantly inhibited weight loss in mice, decreased the lung wet to dry weight (W/D) ratios and attenuated lung histopathological changes, such as infiltration of inflammatory cells and coagulation, pulmonary edema. Furthermore, we found that TML markedly reduced the LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), decreased nitric oxide (NO), and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and effectively ameliorated LPS-induced increased total protein, leukocyte and macrophages in BALF. In addition, TML pronouncedly suppressed the activation of the MAPKs p38-NLRP3/caspase-1 and COX2, increased the expression of p-AMPK-Nrf2, and suppressed the expression of KEAP, apoptotic-related protein as well as autophagy.These results suggested that TML ameliorated LPS-induced acute lung injury by inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines and reducing oxidative damage associated with the MAPKs p38-NLRP3/caspase-1 and COX2 signaling pathways, AMPK-Nrf2/KEAP signaling pathways, as well as apoptosis and autophagy.Copyright © 2019.

The syndrome is caused by an intronic mutation in POLA1, the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase-α (Pol-α), which is responsible for Okazaki fragment synthesis during DNA replication. Reduced POLA1 expression in this condition triggers spontaneous type I interferon expression, which can be linked to the autoinflammatory manifestations of the disease. However, the history of recurrent infections in this syndrome is as yet unexplained. Here we report that patients with XLPDR have reduced NK cell cytotoxic activity and decreased numbers of NK cells, particularly differentiated, stage V, cells (CD3-CD56dim). This phenotype is reminiscent of hypomorphic mutations in MCM4, which encodes a component of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase complex that is functionally linked to Pol-α during the DNA replication process. We find that POLA1 deficiency leads to MCM4 depletion and that both can impair NK cell natural cytotoxicity and show that this is due to a defect in lytic granule polarization. Altogether, our study provides mechanistic connections between Pol-α and the MCM complex and demonstrates their relevance in NK cell function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673415>Safety and efficacy of switching from adalimumab to sarilumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in the ongoing MONARCH open-label extension.</a></h1><p>Evaluate open-label sarilumab monotherapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis switching from adalimumab monotherapy in MONARCH (); assess long-term safety and efficacy in patients continuing sarilumab during open-label extension (OLE).During the 48-week OLE, patients received sarilumab 200 mg subcutaneously once every 2 weeks. Safety (March 2017 cut-off) and efficacy, including patient-reported outcomes, were evaluated.In the double-blind phase, patients receiving sarilumab or adalimumab monotherapy showed meaningful improvements in disease activity; sarilumab was superior to adalimumab for improving signs, symptoms and physical function. Overall, 320/369 patients completing the 24-week double-blind phase entered OLE (155 switched from adalimumab; 165 continued sarilumab). Sarilumab safety profile was consistent with previous reports. Treatment-emergent adverse events were similar between groups; no unexpected safety signals emerged in the first 10 weeks postswitch. Among switch patients, improvement in disease activity was evident at OLE week 12: 47.1%/34.8% had changes ≥1.2 in Disease Activity Score (28 joints) (DAS28)-erythrocyte sedimentation rate/DAS28-C-reactive protein. In switch patients achieving low disease activity (LDA: Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≤10; Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) ≤11) by OLE week 24, 70.7%/69.5% sustained CDAI/SDAI LDA at both OLE weeks 36 and 48. Proportions of switch patients achieving CDAI ≤2.8 and SDAI ≤3.3 by OLE week 24 increased through OLE week 48. Improvements postswitch approached continuation-group values, including scores ≥normative values.During this OLE, there were no unexpected safety issues in patients switching from adalimumab to sarilumab monotherapy, and disease activity improved in many patients. Patients continuing sarilumab reported safety consistent with prolonged use and had sustained benefit.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

Intake of trans fatty acids (TFAs) is associated with an increased risk of CVD. This risk is usually associated with industrial TFAs (iTFAs) rather than ruminant TFAs (rTFAs); however it is not clear how specific TFA isomers differ in their biological activity and mechanisms of action with regard to . Here we review the literature on 18‑carbon TFAs, including the research associating their intake or levels with CVD and studies relating 18‑carbon TFA exposure to modulation of inflammatory processes. The evidence associating iTFAs with CVD risk factors is fairly consistent and studies in humans usually show a relation between iTFAs and higher levels of inflammatory markers. In contrast, studies in humans, animals and in vitro suggest that rTFAs have null or mildly beneficial effects in cardiovascular health, metabolic parameters and inflammatory markers, although the evidence is not always consistent. More studies are needed to better identify the beneficial and detrimental effects of the different TFAs, including those with 18 carbons.Copyright © 2019.

Ly6G is a GPI-linked leukocyte surface Ag understood primarily as a marker of mouse neutrophils, although its full function is not known. Here, we show that Ly6G/Gr1, detected by mAbs 1A8 (anti-Ly6G) and RB6-8C5 (anti-Gr1), is detected prominently on a significant fraction of eosinophils from mouse bone marrow and bone marrow-derived culture, with fractions expressing this Ag increasing in IL-5-enriched microenvironments. Among our findings, we identified SiglecF Gr1 eosinophils in bone marrow from naïve, allergen-challenged and IL-5 transgenic mice; SiglecF Gr1 eosinophils were also prominent ex vivo in bone marrow-derived eosinophils (bmEos) in IL-5-enriched culture. Reducing the IL-5 concentration 20-fold had no impact on the rate of generation of SiglecF bmEos but did result in a marked increase in the Gr1 fraction (from 17.4 ± 2% to 30 ± 2.3%, ***P < 0.005). Reducing the IL-5 concentration also enhanced chemotaxis; SiglecF Gr1 bmEos were considerably more responsive to eotaxin-1 than were their SiglecF Gr1 counterparts. These results suggest that (i) IL-5 regulates the expression of Ly6G/Gr1, either directly or indirectly, in cells of the eosinophil lineage, (ii) eosinophils generated in response to high concentrations of IL-5 can be distinguished from those generated under homeostatic conditions by expression of the Ly6G/Gr1 cell surface Ag, and (iii) expression of Ly6G/Gr1 may have an impact on function, directly or indirectly, including the potential to undergo chemotaxis in response to eotaxin-1.©2019 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669760>Inhibition of the Keap1-Nrf2 protein-protein interaction protects retinal cells and ameliorates retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury.</a></h1><p>The Nrf2-Keap1 pathway regulates transcription of a wide array of antioxidant and cytoprotective genes and offers critical protection against oxidative stress.

Retinal vascular endothelial cells are an important participant in ischemic injury. In this setting, Nrf2 provides a protective pathway via amelioration of oxidative stress and . In this study, we investigated a potent small molecule inhibitor of the Nrf2-Keap1 protein-protein interaction (PPI), CPUY192018, for its therapeutic potential in retinal cells and retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. In human retinal endothelial cells (HREC), treatment with CPUY192018 increased Nrf2 protein levels and nuclear translocation, stimulated Nrf2-ARE-induced transcriptional capacity, and induced Nrf2 target gene expression. Furthermore, CPUY192018 protected HREC against oxidative stress and inflammatory activation. CPUY192018 also activated Nrf2 and suppressed inflammatory response in macrophages. In the retinal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) model, administration of CPUY192018 induced Nrf2 target gene activation in the retina. Both systemic and topical treatment with CPUY192018 rescued visual function after ischemia-reperfusion injury. Taken together, these findings indicate that small molecule Keap1-Nrf2 PPI inhibitors can activate the Nrf2 pathway in the retina and provide protection against retinal ischemic and inflammatory injury, suggesting Keap1-Nrf2 PPI inhibition in the treatment of retinal conditions.Copyright © 2019.

PML after lung transplantation is rare and has a poor prognosis, with no established therapies. Reducing the patient's immunosuppressant doses, thereby restoring immunity, could be used to treat PML. However, some patients develop immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) with this treatment, an immune-induced inflammatory response to JCV that results in serious neuronal damage. We herein report a case of a 60-year-old female who suffered from PML 5 years after lung transplantation, had worsened brain lesions thought to be related to PML-IRIS at the time of immunosuppressant reduction, and missed treatment opportunities.A 60-year-old female developed PML 5 years after lung transplantation. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple high-signal lesions, mainly in the cerebral white matter. Polymerase chain reaction found 0.32 million copies/mL of JCV in the cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, she was given a diagnosis of PML. Mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus dosages were reduced, and CD4-positive cell counts and the blood concentration of each immunosuppressant were monitored. Mefloquine was also orally administered at a daily dose of 275 mg for 3 days and was then administered at a dose of 275 mg per week. Although the patient's CD4-positive cell counts increased and her immune system recovered, her symptoms and brain MRI findings worsened. We suspected PML progression or a transition to PML-IRIS. Steroid pulse therapy to suppress the inflammatory lesions was not possible but was retrospectively indicated. The patient rapidly began to exhibit akinetic mutism and died 4 months after the onset of neurologic symptoms.When neurologic symptoms and abnormal brain MRI findings are noted during immune recovery, it is often difficult to distinguish between progressed PML and PML-IRIS. However, the pathogenesis of brain lesions usually involves  and immune-reactive mechanisms for JCV.

Upon stimulation, MCs secrete numerous newly synthesized mediators, but the mechanism of the release of chemokines is not well known. IL-33 is an "alarmin", known to augment allergic stimulation of MCs, but its effect on the release of chemokines is not well known. Stimulation of cultured human MCs (LAD2) and primary MCs (hCBMCs) by IL-33 (1-100 ng/ml) resulted in significant increased gene expression and release of the chemokines CCL5 (P < 0.0001) and CCL2 (P < 0.01). Stimulation with IL-33 (10 ng/ml) activated MAPK components, as shown by phosphorylation of p38α MAPK, JNK, and c-Jun using Western blot analysis. Inhibition of these responses by known inhibitors confirmed that CCL5 and CCL2 are regulated by p38α MAPK, JNK, and IκB-α. Gene expression and release of CCL5 and CCL2 stimulated by IL-33 were significantly inhibited by pre-treatment (10, 50, 100 μM) for 2 h with the flavonoid methoxyluteolin (3',4',5,7-tetramethoxyflavone). The inhibition by methoxyluteolin (50 μM) was not mediated via MAPK inhibition as phosphorylated p38α MAPK and JNK expression were not affected. In conclusion, IL-33 plays an important role in chemokine release from human MCs and is regulated by more than one signaling pathway.

To this aim, the present study assessed histopathological and ultrastructural alterations (by means of H&E and TEM, respectively) in rat lung and liver, 7 and 28 days after a single intratracheal instillation (i.t) of a low AgNP dose (50 microg/rat), compared to those induced by an equivalent dose of ionic silver (7 microg AgNO3/rat). Lung parenchyma injury was observed acutely after either AgNPs or AgNO, with the latter compound causing more pronounced effects. Specifically, alveolar collapse accompanied by inflammatory alterations and parenchymal fibrosis were revealed. These effects lasted until the 28th day, a partial pulmonary structure recovery occurred, nevertheless a persistence of slight inflammatory/fibrotic response and apoptotic phenomena were still detected after AgNPs and AgNO, respectively. Concerning the liver, a diffuse hepatocyte injury was observed, characterized by cytoplasmic damage and dilation of sinusoids, engulfed by degraded material, paralleled by  onset. These effects already detectable at day 7, persisting at the 28th day with some attenuations, were more marked after AgNO compared to AgNPs, with the latter able to induce a ductular reaction. Altogether the present findings indicate toxic effects induced by AgNPs both at the portal entry (i.e. lung) and distant tissue (i.e. liver), although the overall pulmonary damage were more striking compared to the hepatic outcomes.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669775>Silibinin ameliorates STZ-induced impairment of memory and learning by up- regulating insulin signaling pathway and attenuating apoptosis.</a></h1><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, mainly characterized by cognitive dysfunction and memory impairment. Due to its pathological similarities to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), such as β-amyloid deposition, oxidative stress, , disordered glucose metabolism, impaired signaling pathways of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), we speculate that AD is another form of brain diabetes. Clarifying the relationship between T2DM and AD is important for us to better understand the exact pathological mechanisms of AD. Silibinin, a polyphenolic flavonoid extracted from the seeds of Silybum marianum, exerts hepatoprotective, anti- diabetic and neuroprotective effects. Streptozotocin (STZ), which is used to disrupt the insulin signal transduction pathway, could well mimic the sporadic AD models by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection. Therefore, we selected ICV injection of STZ (ICV-STZ) to investigate the neuroprotective effects of silibinin in rats and to make a foundation for further exploring the relationship between AD and T2DM. ICV-STZ obviously caused memory damage, sharply reduced the number of nissl bodies and destroyed morphological structure of hippocampal neuronal cells, while silibinin attenuated the damages. Moreover, silibinin significantly decreased STZ-induced tau hyperphosphorylation (ser404) in hippocampus and cerebral cortex, markedly inhibited apoptosis of neurons induced by STZ, and up-regulated insulin signal transduction pathway. Silibinin exerts neuroprotective effect in STZ-treated rats, indicating the potential of silibinin for the treatment of AD patients with T2DM in future.Copyright © 2019.

While low-grade  may impair immune response, it is unknown whether inflammatory markers are associated with infection risk in this clinical population. Using 2003-2013 data from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study (3,597 participants with CKD), we assessed the association of baseline plasma levels of four inflammatory markers (interleukin-6 [IL-6], tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α], interleukin-1 receptor antagonist [IL-1RA], and transforming growth factor-β [TGF-β]), with incident hospitalization with major infection (pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis and osteomyelitis, and bacteremia and sepsis). During follow-up (median 7.5years), 36% (n=1,290) had incident hospitalization with major infection. In multivariable Cox analyses with each inflammatory marker modeled as a restricted cubic spline, higher levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were monotonically associated with increased risk of hospitalization with major infection (HR at 95thvs.5thpercentile, 2.11 [95%CI,1.68,2.66] for IL-6 and 1.88 [1.51,2.33] for TNF-α), while corresponding associations for IL-1RA or TGF-β were non-significant. Thus, higher plasma levels of IL-6 and TNF-α, but not IL-1RA or TGF-β, were significantly associated with increased risk of hospitalization with major infection. Future studies should investigate whether inflammatory pathways that involve IL-6 and TNF-α increase susceptibility to infection among individuals with CKD.© The Author(s) 2019.

Among the groups SCA and HbSC was found a higher proportion of increased triglycerides (TG) in SCA. High levels of TG were significantly associated with lower hemoglobin (p = 0.006) and HDL-C (p = 0.037), higher white blood cell count (p = 0.027), LDH (p = 0.004) and bilirubins (p < 0.05) in SCD. Patients with HDL-C ≤40 mg/dL had higher markers hemolytic levels. Therapy of HU significantly influenced several hematological and biochemical parameters but not lipid fractions. Genotypes of the APOA5 rs662799 were not associated with lipid levels. The G-risk allele rs964184/ZPRI ZNF259/ZPR1 gene (GC + GG genotypes) was associated with increased levels of TG in children ≥10 years old (p = 0.045) and the atherogenic ratio TG/HDL-C (p = 0.032) in SCD. The use of HU improves levels of hemolysis and  markers in SCD with high TG and, while not interfering with lipid levels, seems to overlap the effect of the G-risk allele in on them. This study reported for the first time that rs964184 SNP could be a genetic modifier of TG in SCD.Copyright © 2019.

Instead of activating or blocking protein function, a growing repertoire of drug modalities can be leveraged or engineered to hijack cellular processes, such as translational regulation or degradation mechanisms. Drug hunters can therefore access a wider arsenal of modes-of-action to modulate biological processes and this review summarises these emerging strategies by highlighting the most representative examples of these approaches.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675376>Ang-(1-7)/ MAS1 receptor axis inhibits allergic airway  via blockade of Src-mediated EGFR transactivation in a murine model of asthma.</a></h1><p>The angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)]/MAS1 receptor signaling axis is a key endogenous anti-inflammatory signaling pathway. However, the mechanisms by which its mediates the anti-inflammatory effects are not completely understood. Using an allergic murine model of asthma, we investigated whether Ang-1(1-7)/MAS1 receptor axis a): inhibits allergic  via modulation of Src-dependent transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and downstream signaling effectors such as ERK1/2, and b): directly inhibits neutrophil and/or eosinophil chemotaxis ex vivo. Ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic  resulted in increased phosphorylation of Src kinase, EGFR, and ERK1/2. In addition, OVA challenge increased airway cellular influx, perivascular and peribronchial , fibrosis, goblet cell hyper/metaplasia and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Treatment with Ang-(1-7) inhibited phosphorylation of Src kinase, EGFR, ERK1/2, the cellular and histopathological changes and AHR. Ang-(1-7) treatment also inhibited neutrophil and eosinophil chemotaxis ex vivo. These changes were reversed following pre-treatment with A779. These data show that the anti-inflammatory actions of Ang-(1-7)/ MAS1 receptor axis are mediated, at least in part, via inhibition of Src-dependent transactivation of EGFR and downstream signaling molecules such as ERK1/2. This study therefore shows that inhibition of the Src/EGRF/ERK1/2 dependent signaling pathway is one of the mechanisms by which the Ang-(1-7)/ MAS1 receptor axis mediates it anti-inflammatory effects in diseases such as asthma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675389>Changes in inflammatory biomarkers before and after SSRI therapy in PTSD: A review.</a></h1><p>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are regarded as the standard pharmacotherapy for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recent studies indicate that neuroinflammation is associated with PTSD. We conducted a search of the literature to determine if SSRI efficacy is associated with a decrease in  levels.A literature search was conducted to identify studies published from January 2000 to January 2019 that measured changes in inflammatory biomarkers before and after SSRI treatment in patients with PTSD.Four studies met the criteria for inclusion. In one study, SSRI use significantly reduced interleukein-1beta. An open trial of paroxetine found a significant decline in cortisol. In a third study, paroxetine treatment in patients with PTSD and depression showed no significant changes in cortisol. Finally, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid in patients with PTSD showed no significant changes in corticotropin-releasing factor, interleukin-6, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or insulin-like growth factor 1. Substance P was found to be decreased.Our review had mixed results regarding whether SSRI therapy for PTSD is associated with a reduction in . These findings may be due to the heterogeneity of PTSD.

We have studied the association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] with markers of  and oxidative stress.We have recruited total 180 male and female subjects aged between 30-50 years and divided them into two groups as control (n=90) and T2DM (n=90). We have measured 25(OH)D concentration, markers of  including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and markers of oxidative stress including malondialdehyde (MDA) and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) by using standard methods.We stratified control and T2DM groups by 25(OH)D concentration and it indicates that in severe deficiency and sufficiency category IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and Ox-LDL were significantly different while in moderate deficiency category only MDA was significantly different, among control and T2DM groups. In an insufficiency category, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, MDA, and Ox-LDL were significantly different among control and T2DM groups. Correlation analysis indicates a negative correlation of 25(OH)D with IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and Ox-LDL among total subjects. Further, logistics regression analysis demonstrated a significant association of different categories of 25(OH)D with IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and Ox-LDL before and after adjustment to body mass index and waist to hip ratio.This study suggest that vitamin D may have significant implications in the prevention of  and oxidative stress.Copyright © 2019.

However, their roles in RA remain unclear. We investigated the association of AFR/CAR with the concentration of autoantibodies and Th17 cells in RA.A total of 196 RA patients, 200 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and 200 healthy donors (HD) who were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University were enrolled. The results of FIB, ALB, CRP, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP), rheumatoid factor (RF) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) from RA patients and SLE patients were retrospectively analyzed. The percentage of Th17 cells in peripheral blood of RA patients was detected by flow cytometry, and the relative expression of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-17A was detected by RT-qPCR. Correlation analysis of AFR/CAR and Th17 cells, CRP, ESR, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-17A in RA was conducted.Compared with SLE patients and healthy donors (HD), AFR concentration was significantly lower (P < 0.01) in RA patients, while CAR concentration was significantly increased (P < 0.01) in RA patients. AFR showed negative correlation with CRP (r = -0.7103), ESR (r = -0.6542), RF (-0.2219), Th17 cells (r = -0.5952) and IL-17A (r = -0.4681).

Unlike for other rheumatic diseases, no specific biomarkers are available in clinical practice for diagnosing SpA. The aim of the present study was to search new potential biomarkers for SpA diagnosis by focusing on the innate immune response. An evaluation was made of the mRNA expression levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, TGF-β1, S100A8, S100A9) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP3, MMP8, MMP9) in blood mononuclear cells of SpA patients (n=64) with respect to controls (n=100). In parallel, the pattern of intracellular calcium flows of blood monocytes was verified in order to ascertain whether any specific fingerprint characterizes innate immune cells in SpA patients. Inflammatory cytokines and MMPs expression levels were not correlated with SpA, while in this disease a reduced expression of the S100A8 and a decreased frequency of monocytes showing intracellular calcium flows were observed. In conclusion, no specific signs of systemic  are detectable in SpA, but the disease affects the "on-off" mechanisms that regulate the concentration of intracellular calcium and calcium-related proteins. This potentially pave the way for the discovery of new biomarkers.Copyright © 2019.

Icariin, a flavonol glucoside, extracted from Herba Epimedii, offers various pharmacological activities, including reducing  and an antioxidant effect. We aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of icariin focussing on both HO-1/Nrf2 and NF-kB pathways. Acute  was induced in rats via carrageenan in this study. Icariin was injected in a dose of 50 mg/kg. Icariin significantly reduced paw swelling in carrageenan-injected animals. It also ameliorated carrageenan-induced paw histopathological alterations. Icariin significantly increased paw enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. It decreased paw lipid peroxidation. Icariin decreased paw levels of inflammatory cytokines and NF-kB. The immunohistochemical analysis showed that icariin significantly increased Nrf2 gene expression while decreasing NF-kB and COX-2 gene expression. RT-PCR analysis revealed that icariin injection significantly increased both Nrf2 and HO-1 expression of mRNA.

This study aimed to characterise , predict prognosis, and understand the impact of drug therapy using Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE).Patients with a stricture diagnosed on MRE over a 5-year period were reviewed for MRE disease extent and , clinical course, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), response to anti-TNF therapy, endoscopic dilatation, hospitalization and surgery.136 patients had 235 (77 one and 59 ≥ two) strictures.46% of patients underwent surgery after a median 6 months; median follow-up for those not requiring surgery was 41 months. Predictors of surgery: Hospitalization due to obstruction predicted subsequent surgery (OR 2.50; 95% CI 1.06-5.90) while anti-TNF therapy commenced at stricture diagnosis was associated with a reduced risk (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.05-0.99). MRE characteristics associated with surgery were proximal bowel dilatation ≥30mm diameter (OR, 2.98; 95% CI 1.36-6.55), stricture bowel wall thickness ≥10mm (OR 2.42; 95% CI 1.11-5.27), and stricture length >5cm (OR 2.56; 95% CI 1.21-5.43). 81% of patients with these 3 adverse MRE features required surgery versus 17% if none were present (P<0.001). Accuracy for these 3 MRE variables predicting surgery was high (AUC 0.76).MRE findings in Crohn's disease strictures are highly predictive of the disease course and the need for future surgery. MRE may also identify who would benefit from treatment intensification. Anti-TNF therapy is associated with reduced risk of surgery and appears to alter the natural history of this complication.This article is protected by copyright.

Endothelial dysfunction has been considered an important step in the initiation of the disease. TIPE1 is a newly identified protein of the TIPE family, and plays a vital role in  and tumorigenesis. However, its role in atherogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that TIPE1 promoted atherogenesis by inducing endothelial dysfunction. When human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to oxidative stress, the level of TIPE1 was significantly up-regulated, and the ROS generation markedly increased in TIPE1 over-expressing HUVECs. As a result, the growth of HUVECs was inhibited, and the apoptosis was enhanced. However, the cell contact ability between HUVECs and THP-1 cells were augmented due to the up-regulation of adhesion molecules such as E-selectin and ICAM-1 induced by TIPE1 overexpression. Importantly, ApoE mice injected with TIPE1 recombinant lentivirus developed significantly severe atherosclerosis accompanied by hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia and increased white blood count. These findings indicated that excessive ROS induced by the overexpression of TIPE1 in endothelial cells accelerated the process of atherogenesis.Copyright © 2019.

The aim of this study was to explore the molecular mechanisms of its role in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).NAFLD mouse models were established by using eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD) or (and) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 18 weeks. From the beginning of HFD, HFD-induced mice were subjected to amlexanox or vehicle for 18 weeks. HFD+LPS-induced mice were treated with amlexanox or vehicle for the last 6 weeks. Blood biochemistry parameters were determined using automatic biochemistry analyzer. Histological changes of liver tissue were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and Oil Red O staining. The expressions of IKKε and smooth muscle actin-α (α-SMA) were evaluated through immunohistochemistry. Serum inflammatory mediator was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Gene expressions involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin signaling pathway were examined using quantitative RT-PCR or Western blotting.This study demonstrated that amlexanox reversed glucose and lipid metabolic disturbance and hepatic steatosis in NAFLD mice model. IKKε was specific expressed in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) instead of hepatocytes. This study also found that amlexanox improved insulin signaling (Insulin-IRS-1-Akt) in hepatocytes through inhibiting  (IKKε-NF-κB-TNF-α/IL-1α) in HSCs.The present study confirmed that IKKε was specific expressed in HSCs.

Both variants, especially dermokine αβγ-deficient mice exhibited scale and wrinkle formation resembling ichthyosis accompanied by transepidermal water imbalance at the neonatal stage. When reared under low humidity several dermokine αβγ-deficient mice died by postnatal day 21. Moreover, the cornified envelope (CE) was vulnerable, and skin barrier lipid ceramides were reduced in the epidermis of dermokine αβγ-deficient mice. cDNA microarray and quantitative RT-PCR assays of the epidermis revealed upregulation of small proline-rich protein and late CE family members, as well as antimicrobial peptides in dermokine αβγ-deficient mice. These barrier gene signatures were similar to that seen in psoriasis, whereas recent studies demonstrated that congenital ichthyosis has gene profiles resembling psoriasis. In line with these findings, adult dermokine αβγ-deficient mice exhibited aggravated phenotypes in psoriasis-like dermatitis models but not in allergic dermatitis models.

Cardiac surgery triggers  in the heart and makes it susceptible to the incidence of AF. Therefore, anti-inflammatory drugs may reduce the rate of AF incidence in the post-surgery conditions. Immunosuppressant agents, steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (corticosteroids), non-aspirin non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine and omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids (n-3 UFA) are drugs with well-known anti-inflammatory properties. The efficacy, safety and other aspects of using these drugs in the prevention of post-operative AF (POAF) have been reviewed here. Studies evaluating the efficacy of colchicine have shown that it could be effective in the prevention of POAF. However, there is a need for additional studies to find a colchicine regimen with optimal efficacy and higher tolerability. The use of corticosteroids may also be of value based on the most of meta-analyses. In the case of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and NSAIDs, current data fail to support their efficacy in POAF prevention. Moreover, perioperative administration of NSAIDs may be associated with some severe safety considerations. Immunosuppressant agents have not been used for the prevention of POAF.

However, the toxicity of FG has drawn increasing concern, especially its hepatotoxicity. The purpose of this study was to screen the hepatotoxic components of FG and evaluate their effects on rat liver BRL-3A cells. The chemical composition of FG was determined by HPLC-ESI-MS. CCK-8 assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of ten chemical components from FG, and then the toxic components with significant inhibitory activity were selected for further study. The results showed that geniposide, genipin, genipin-1-gentiobioside, gardenoside, and shanzhiside all suppress cells viability. Apoptosis assays further indicated that geniposide and its metabolite genipin are the main hepatotoxic components of FG. Pretreatment of cells with geniposide or genipin increased the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) were decreased, while the malondialdehyde (MDA) level was increased. The cell contents of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and nitric oxide (NO) were also increased. Molecular docking simulations were used to investigate the mechanism of FG-induced hepatotoxicity, revealing that geniposide and genipin bind strongly to the pro-inflammatory factor TNFR1 receptor of the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. The obtained results strongly indicate that the hepatotoxicity of FG is caused by iridoids compounds. Genipin had the most significant hepatotoxic effect. These toxic substances destroy the cell antioxidant defense system, increasing inflammatory injury to the liver cells and leading to apoptosis and even necrosis. Thus, this study lays a foundation for toxicology research into FG and its rational application.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672144>Diabetes and baseline glucose are associated with , left ventricular function and short- and long-term outcome in acute coronary syndromes: role of the novel biomarker Cyr 61.</a></h1><p>Hyperglycemia in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) impacts short term outcomes, but little is known about longer term effects. We therefore designed this study to firstly determine the association between hyperglycemia and short term and longer term outcomes in patients presenting with ACS and secondly evaluate the prognostic role of diabetes, body mass index (BMI) and the novel biomarker Cyr61 on outcomes.The prospective Special Program University Medicine-Acute Coronary Syndrome (SPUM-ACS) cohort enrolled 2168 patients with ACS between December 2009 and October 2012, of which 2034 underwent PCI (93.8%). Patients were followed up for 12 months. Events were independently adjudicated by three experienced cardiologists. Participants were recruited from four tertiary hospitals in Switzerland: Zurich, Geneva, Lausanne and Bern. Participants presenting with acute coronary syndromes and who underwent coronary angiography were included in the analysis. Patients were grouped according to history of diabetes (or HbA1c greater than 6%), baseline blood sugar level (BSL; < 6, 6-11.1 and > 11.1 mmol/L) and body mass index (BMI). The primary outcome was major adverse cardiac events (MACE) which was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke and all-cause death. Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary endpoint, revascularisations, bleeding events (BARC classification) and cerebrovascular events (ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke or TIA).Patients with hyperglycemia, i.e. BSL ≥ 11.1 mmol/L, had higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC), creatinine kinase (CK), higher heart rates and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and increased N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. At 30 days and 12 months, those with BSL ≥ 11.1 mmol/L had more MACE and death compared to those with BSL < 6.0 mmol/L or 6.0-11.1 mmol/L (HR-ratio 4.78 and 6.6; p < 0.001). The novel biomarker Cyr61 strongly associated with high BSL and STEMI and was independently associated with 1 year outcomes (HR 2.22; 95% CI 1.33-3.72; Tertile 3 vs. Tertile 1).In this large, prospective, independently adjudicated cohort of in all comers ACS patients undergoing PCI, both a history of diabetes and elevated entry glucose was associated with  and increased risk of MACE both at short and long-term.

The existence of neutrophil-rich  in colon tissues of patients with UC is one of the most significant histological features of this disease. Nonetheless, the expression of CXCR chemokine receptors which appear as the main chemical mediators governing the migration of neutrophils into the mucosal tissue of patients with UC has not been well clarified.In this experimental study, the UC model was induced in Wistar rats by administration of 2 ml 4% acetic acid into the large colon through the rectum. Animals were anesthetized after 48 h; their colon tissue samples were isolated for macroscopic and histopathological examination. The expression of receptor of CXC chemokine was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) technique.Heavy infiltration of neutrophils, coagulative necrosis, and ulcers were observed in H and E staining, which pathologically proved the UC model. qRT-PCR results indicated that CXCR2 as one of the important ELR chemokine family receptors bears the highest expression in the UC group (32 fold) than the control group ( ≤ 0.05). In addition, other CXCRs of this group including CXCR1 did not possess any change ( > 0.05). In contrast, RLR negative chemokine family receptors did not show any changes with the normal group.The results showed that CXCR2 is the only receptor for CXCL family which was remarkably upregulated in experimental UC and that CXCR2 might play a significant role in the pathogenesis of UC.Copyright: © 2019 Advanced Biomedical Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674093>A Bioengineered Living Cell Construct Activates Metallothionein/Zinc/MMP8 and Inhibits TGFβ to Stimulate Remodeling of Fibrotic Venous Leg Ulcers.</a></h1><p>Venous leg ulcers (VLU) represent a major clinical unmet need, impairing quality of life for millions worldwide. The bioengineered living cell construct (BLCC) is the only FDA-approved therapy demonstrating efficacy in healing chronic VLU, yet its in vivo mechanisms of action are not well understood. Previously, we reported a BLCC-mediated acute wounding response at the ulcer edge; in this study we elucidated the BLCC-specific effects on the epidermis-free ulcer bed. We conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ) enrolling 30 subjects with non-healing VLUs, and performed genotyping, genomic profiling and functional analysis on wound bed biopsies obtained at baseline and one week after treatment with BLCC plus compression or compression therapy (control). The VLU bed transcriptome featured processes of chronic  and was strikingly enriched for fibrotic/fibrogenic pathways and gene networks. BLCC application decreased expression of pro-fibrotic TGFß1 gene targets and increased levels of TGFß inhibitor decorin. Surprisingly, BLCC upregulated metallothioneins and fibroblast-derived MMP8 collagenase, and promoted endogenous release of MMP-activating zinc to stimulate anti-fibrotic remodeling, a novel mechanism of cutaneous wound healing. By activating a remodeling program in the quiescent VLU bed, BLCC application shifts nonhealing to healing phenotype. As VLU bed fibrosis correlates with poor clinical healing, findings from this study identify the chronic VLU as a fibrotic skin disease and are first to support the development and application of anti-fibrotic therapies as a successful treatment approach.

Long-term outcomes and predictors of future CV events were analyzed in 936 patients with 1246 affected legs.This study cohort comprised 21% claudicants and 79% critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients. Compared with claudicants, CLI patients had higher rates of medical comorbidities, tissue , and lesion complexities. During the study period, 349 patients died (130 CV deaths and 219 non-CV deaths), 306 had non-fatal CV events. The rates of 5-year freedom from all-cause mortality, major CV events (MACEs), and non-fatal CV events were 54.9%, 67.1%, and 56.6% respectively. For CLI patients, independent factors for all-cause mortality were age (odds ratio [OR] 1.03), atrial fibrillation (OR 1.79), albumin (OR 0.62), hematocrit (OR 0.96), body mass index (OR 0.94), C-reactive protein (OR 1.18), dialysis (OR 2.16), and non-ambulance (OR 2.05). Congestive heart failure, dialysis, and non-ambulance independently predicted the MACEs (OR 2.04, 1.93, and 1.67, respectively). For claudicants, coronary artery disease (CAD) was the essential factor for all-cause mortality (OR 2.24), MACE (OR 2.76) and non-fatal CV events (OR 1.82).Long-term survival and MACE-free rates were significantly worse in CLI patients than in claudicants. Malnutrition and  were associated with long-term survival. CAD, low hematocrit, dialysis, CHF, and ambulatory status predicted future CV events.Copyright © 2019 Formosan Medical Association.

We aimed to determine the prevalence of LSTVs and to assess their associations with sacroiliitis by standard radiography and MRI in a population with suspected axial spondyloarthritis.The data were from the DESIR cohort of 688 patients aged 18-50 years with inflammatory low back pain for ⩾3 months but <3 years suggesting axial spondyloarthritis. The baseline pelvic radiographs were read by two blinded readers for the presence and type (Castellvi classification) of LSTVs. Associations between LSTVs and other variables collected at baseline and at the diagnosis were assessed using the χ2 test (or Fisher's exact test) or the Mann-Whitney test.LSTV was found in 200/688 (29.1%) patients. Castellvi type was Ia in 54 (7.8%), Ib in 76 (11.0%), IIa in 20 (2.9%), IIb in 12 (1.7%), IIIa in 7 (1.0%), IIIb in 21 (3.0%) and IV in 10 (1.4%) patients.

The MTT assay was used for cellular viability assessment. Viability of cells was observed using inverted light microscope 24, 48 and 72 h after exposure of the cells to various concentrations of TQ (1, 2.5, 5, 10, 50 and 100 μg/ml) and Cis-platinum (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 6 and 12.5 μg/ml). Moreover, apoptosis was analyzed with a flow-cytometry method. The untreated cells were considered as control group.Morphological changes such as reduced cell number and increased intercellular distance and reduced cell viability in ACHN and GP-293cell lines were observed in both TQ and Cis-platinum groups; however, Cis-platinum had greater effect on ACHN cell line than GP-293 cell line. In addition, GP-293 cell line was more sensitive to TQ compared to ACHN cell line. Furthermore, TQ and Cis-platinum had apoptotic effects on both ACHN and GP-293 cell lines.Our findings demonstrated that TQ and Cis-platinum had cytotoxic and apoptotic effects on both cell lines, However, GP-293 cell line was more sensitive to TQ.

It had been unclear how lack of ZDHHC13 proteins resulted in cutaneous abnormalities. In this study, we first demonstrate that enzymatic palmitoylation activity, rather than protein scaffolding, by ZDHHC13 is essential for skin barrier integrity, showing that knock-in mice bearing an enzymatically dead DQ-to-AA ZDHHC13 mutation cyclically lost their hair after weaning, recapitulating knock-out phenotypes of skin  and dermatitis. To establish the ZDHHC13 substrates responsible for skin barrier development, we employed quantitative proteomic approaches to identify protein molecules whose palmitoylation is tightly controlled by ZDHHC13. We identified over 300 candidate proteins that could be classified into four biological categories: immunological disease, skin development and function, dermatological disease, and lipid metabolism. Palmitoylation of three of these candidates-loricrin, peptidyl arginine deiminase type III and keratin fiber crosslinker transglutaminase 1-by ZDHHC13 was confirmed by biochemical assay. Palmitoylation was critical for in vivo protein stability of the latter two candidates. Our findings reveal the importance of protein palmitoylation in skin barrier development, partly by promoting envelope protein crosslinking and the filaggrin processing pathway.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Classic white light endoscopy shows some pathognomonic signs of LPR in children, such as thickening of pharyngo-laryngeal mucus, the cobblestoning aspect of pharyngeal mucosa, arytenoid edema/hyperemia, nodular thickening/true vocal cord edema, hypertrophy of the posterior commissure, subglottic edema. The NBI (Narrow Band Imaging) technology, generally used in oncology, allows to study neoangiogenesis and hypervascularization of the mucosa, common aspects in both chronic  and neoplastic transformation. The aim of our study was to evaluate the added value of this technology in identifying the main laryngopharyngeal reflux sign in a pediatric population.We evaluated at the Otolaryngology Unit of the "Fondazione Policlinico A. Gemelli" hospital and the Airway Surgery Unit of the "Bambino Gesù" Children's Hospital 35 patients aged from 2 months to 16 years divided into two groups in the period between November 2017 and May 2018. Group A included patients with clinical suspicion of LPR after gastroenterologist evaluation and Group B included patients who underwent an endoscopic evaluation for the assessment of recurrent respiratory symptoms such as stridor, recurrent croup, wheezing and persistent cough. We performed an endoscopic evaluation by white light and NBI for each patient, comparing the results of both methods to evaluate signs of pharyngo-laryngeal reflux and to calculate the value of reflux finding score (RFS).The analysis of the data showed: for Group A an average value of RFS with white light of 11,84 (range 8-17, standard deviation 2,52 ± 0,57) and with NBI of 13,63 (range 10-17, standard deviation 2,13 ± 0,49); for Group B the analysis of the data showed an average value of RFS with white light of 10,06 (range 8-14, standard deviation 2,32 ± 0,58) and with NBI of 12,50 (range 9-18, standard deviation 2,63 ± 0,65). The comparison between the two methods resulted significant. Furthermore evaluation by NBI allowed to highlight other signs of pharyngo-laryngeal reflux, characteristic of pediatric age and not included in RFS, in particular cobblestone aspect of the hypopharingeal mucosa, phlogosis of the tonsillar crypts and adenoid surface, hyperemia and hypervascularization of subglottic and tracheal mucosa.Although still preliminary our results represent an interesting starting point for further studies, because they underline the potentiality of NBI endoscopy in LPR evaluation and how this technology could improve the identification of reflux signs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Protein deimination is an irreversible post-translational modification caused by the peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) family of enzymes, which convert arginine into citrulline in target proteins. Protein deimination can cause structural and functional protein changes, facilitating protein moonlighting, but also leading to neo-epitope generation and effects on gene regulation. Furthermore, PADs have been found to regulate cellular release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are lipid-vesicles released from cells as part of cellular communication. EVs carry protein and genetic cargo and are indicative biomarkers that can be isolated from most body fluids. This study was aimed at profiling deiminated proteins in plasma and EVs of naked mole-rat. Key immune and metabolic proteins were identified to be post-translationally deiminated, with 65 proteins specific for plasma, while 42 proteins were identified to be deiminated in EVs only. Using protein-protein interaction network analysis, deiminated plasma proteins were found to belong to KEEG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways of immunity, infection, cholesterol and drug metabolism, while deiminated proteins in EVs were also linked to KEEG pathways of HIF-1 signalling and glycolysis. The mole-rat EV profiles showed a poly-dispersed population of 50-300 nm, similar to observations of human plasma. Furthermore, the EVs were assessed for three key microRNAs involved in cancer,  and hypoxia. The identification of post-translational deimination of critical immunological and metabolic markers contributes to the current understanding of protein moonlighting functions, via post-translational changes, in the longevity and cancer resistance of naked mole-rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671704>Peripheral Delivery of Neural Precursor Cells Ameliorates Parkinson's Disease-Associated Pathology.</a></h1><p> Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of motor control due to a wide loss of dopaminergic neurons along the nigro-striatal pathway. Some of the mechanisms that contribute to this cell death are , oxidative stress, and misfolded alpha-synuclein-induced toxicity. Current treatments are effective at managing the early motor symptoms of the disease, but they become ineffective over time and lead to adverse effects. Previous research using intracerebral stem cell therapy for treatment of PD has provided promising results; however, this method is very invasive and is often associated with unacceptable side effects. In this study, we used an MPTP-injected mouse model of PD and intravenously administered neural precursors (NPs) obtained from mouse embryonic and mesenchymal stem cells. Clinical signs and neuropathology were assessed. Female mice treated with NPs had improved motor function and reduction in the neuroinflammatory response. In terms of safety, there were no tumorigenic formations or any detectable adverse effect after treatment. Our results suggest that peripheral administration of stem cell-derived NPs may be a promising and safe therapy for the recovery of impaired motor function and amelioration of brain pathology in PD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673715>Determinants of long-term health-related quality of life in adult patients with mild traumatic brain injury.</a></h1><p>Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) usually leads to the appearance of post-concussion symptoms (PCS) which may resolve after a short time. In this study, the mental and physical aspects of quality of life (QoL) were evaluated 6 months after mTBI, and the association of demographic and injury-related factors, post-injury primary executive function and PCS types with the long-term QoL status was investigated.123 eligible mTBI patients of initial sampling participated in follow-up phase of this longitudinal study. The demographic, clinical, and para-clinical data of patients were recorded. Paraclinical data comprised brain lesion volume, type and location determined by CT scan. The executive function and primary PCS were examined during the discharge using the verbal fluency task and a checklist, respectively. QoL was measured via SF-36 questionnaire. The collected data were entered into SPSS 22, and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests.Youngers aged between 18 and 35 years and women had a lower QoL score than others. Primary somatic and cognitive PCS together were associated with poor QoL. There was no significant difference in QoL and executive function scores between the normal and abnormal brain CT groups. However, among people with abnormal CT, those having multifocal lesions including at least an intracranial hemorrhage type such as intra parenchymal hemorrhage or extra-axial bleeding together with other intracranial lesions or skull fracture demonstrated less QoL score in SF-36. A significant correlation was discovered between the scores of the executive function and QoL in mental dimensions of SF-36.This study emphasizes on the clinical significance of early executive function and PCS examination in mTBI population, as well as optimal management of the victims regardless of the initial brain CT findings, especially in high-risk populations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674907>Intestinal infection regulates behavior and learning via neuroendocrine signaling.</a></h1><p>The recognition of pathogens and subsequent activation of defense responses are critical for the survival of organisms. The nematode  recognizes pathogenic bacteria and elicits defense responses by activating immune pathways and pathogen avoidance. Here we show that chemosensation of phenazines produced by pathogenic , which leads to rapid activation of DAF-7/TGF-β in ASJ neurons, is insufficient for the elicitation of pathogen avoidance behavior. Instead, intestinal infection and bloating of the lumen, which depend on the virulence of , regulates both pathogen avoidance and aversive learning by modulating not only the DAF-7/TGF-β pathway but also the G-protein coupled receptor NPR-1 pathway, which also controls aerotaxis behavior. Modulation of these neuroendocrine pathways by intestinal infection serves as a systemic feedback that enables animals to avoid virulent bacteria. These results reveal how feedback from the intestine during infection can modulate the behavior, learning, and microbial perception of the host.© 2019, Singh & Aballay.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672153>Effect of Enterococcus faecalis 2001 on colitis and depressive-like behavior in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice: involvement of the brain-gut axis.</a></h1><p>Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including those with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, have higher rates of psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety; however, the mechanism of psychiatric disorder development remains unclear. Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon  and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus.

The aim of the present study was to compare the CRP levels of PD patients with vs patients without freezing of gait (FOG). Patients and controls participating in the COPPADIS-2015 study that performed blood extraction for determining molecular serum biomarkers were included. Patients with FOG were identified as those with a score of 1 or greater on item-3 of the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOG-Q). Immunoassay was used for determining ultrasensitive CRP (US-CRP) level (mg/dL). In the PD group (n = 225; 61.8 ± 9.5 years old, 61.8% males), 32% of the patients presented FOG but none in the control group (n = 65; 60.3 ± 6.1 years old, 56.9% males) (p < 0.0001). Differences in US-CRP level were significant in patients with FOG vs patients without FOG and vs controls (0.31 ± 0.52 vs 0.16 ± 0.21 vs 0.21 ± 0.22; p = 0.04). Significant differences were also observed between patients with vs without FOG (p = 0.001) but not between patients and controls (p = 0.163).

We previously demonstrated that PRV infection induces a specific and lethal inflammatory response, contributing to severe neuropathy in mice. So far, the mechanisms that initiate this neuroinflammation remain unknown. Using a mouse footpad inoculation model, we found that PRV infection rapidly and simultaneously induces high G-CSF and IL-6 levels in several mouse tissues, including the footpad, PNS and central nervous system (CNS) tissues. Interestingly, this global increase occurred before PRV had replicated in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) neurons and also was independent of systemic . These high G-CSF and IL-6 levels were not caused by neutrophil infiltration in PRV infected tissues, as we did not detect any neutrophils. Efficient PRV replication and spread in the footpad was sufficient to activate DRGs to produce cytokines. Finally, by using knockout mice, we demonstrated that TLR2 and IFN type I play crucial roles in modulating the early neuroinflammatory response and clinical outcome of PRV infection in mice. Overall, these results give new insights into the initiation of virus-induced neuroinflammation during herpesvirus infections.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673072>Cannabidiol Regulates Gene Expression in Encephalitogenic T cells Using Histone Methylation and noncoding RNA during Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis.</a></h1><p>Cannabidiol (CBD) has been shown by our laboratory to attenuate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). In this study, we used microarray and next generation sequencing (NGS)-based approaches to determine whether CBD would alter genome-wide histone modification and gene expression in MOG sensitized lymphocytes. We compared H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 marks in CD4+ T cells from naïve, EAE and CBD treated EAE mice by ChIP-seq. Although the overall methylation level of these two histone marks did not change significantly, the signal intensity and coverage differed in individual genes, suggesting that CBD may modulate gene expression by altering histone methylation. Further analysis showed that these histone methylation signals were differentially enriched in the binding sites of certain transcription factors, such as ZNF143 and FoxA1, suggesting that these transcription factors may play important roles in CBD mediated immune modulation. Using microarray analysis, we found that the expression pattern of many EAE-induced genes was reversed by CBD treatment which was consistent with its effect on attenuating the clinical symptoms of EAE. A unique finding of this study was that the expression of many miRNAs and lncRNAs was dramatically affected by CBD. In summary, this study demonstrates that CBD suppresses  through multiple mechanisms, from histone methylation to miRNA to lncRNA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674682>The regulation of CD4 T cells during malaria.</a></h1><p>Malaria is a major global health problem. Despite decades of research, there is still no effective vaccine to prevent disease in the majority of people living in malaria-endemic regions. Additionally, drug treatment options are continually threatened by the emergence of drug-resistant parasites. Immune responses generated against Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria are generally not sufficient to prevent the establishment of infection and can even contribute to the development of disease, unless individuals have survived multiple infections. Research conducted in experimental models, controlled human malaria infection studies, and with malaria patients from disease-endemic areas indicate the rapid development of immunoregulatory pathways in response to Plasmodium infection. These "imprinted" immune responses limit , and likely prevent progression to severe disease manifestations. However, they also cause slow acquisition of immunity and possibly hamper the development of vaccine-mediated protection against disease. A major target for and mediator of the immunoregulatory pathways established during malaria are CD4 T cells that play critical roles in priming phagocytic cells to capture and kill malaria parasites, as well as helping B cells produce functional anti-parasitic antibodies. In this review, we describe mechanisms of CD4 T cell activation during malaria and discuss the immunoregulatory mechanisms that develop to dampen their anti-parasitic and pathological functions. We also offer some ideas about how host-directed approaches might be applied to modulate CD4 T cell functions to improve vaccine responses and enhance development of natural immunity.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, an overdose of APAP can lead to APAP-induced liver failure, which has emerged as a serious issue in the US and Europe. Pelargonidin is an anthocyanidin found in pomegranates, plums, and various berries. Pelargonidin has strong antioxidant effects, directly scavenging superoxide radicals and inhibiting H₂O₂-induced lipid peroxidation. Focusing on these effects, we studied the preventative effect of pelargonidin on APAP-induced hepatotoxicity and its underlying mechanisms in vivo. We observed that pelargonidin mitigates serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activity, which are strongly associated with APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. We also found that pelargonidin reduced APAP-induced hepatic necrosis by removing excessive ROS. Hepatic necrosis stimulates the release of molecular pathogens that induce , which increases cell stress and can lead to apoptosis. Therefore, pelargonidin was able to reduce levels of necrosis, , and hepatocyte apoptosis. These results indicate that the administration of pelargonidin protects against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity and that it could be a novel protective strategy against APAP-induced liver failure.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).
