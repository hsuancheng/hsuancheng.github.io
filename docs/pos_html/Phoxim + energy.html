<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25135575>Isolation of arginine kinase from Apis cerana cerana and its possible involvement in response to adverse stress.</a></h2><p>Arginine kinases (AK) in invertebrates play the same role as creatine kinases in vertebrates. Both proteins are important for  metabolism, and previous studies on AK focused on this attribute. In this study, the arginine kinase gene was isolated from Apis cerana cerana and was named AccAK. A 5'-flanking region was also cloned and shown to contain abundant putative binding sites for transcription factors related to development and response to adverse stress. We imitated several abiotic and biotic stresses suffered by A. cerana cerana during their life, including heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides, heat, cold, oxidants, antioxidants, ecdysone, and Ascosphaera apis and then studied the expression patterns of AccAK after these treatments. AccAK was upregulated under all conditions, and, in some conditions, this response was very pronounced. Western blot and AccAK enzyme activity assays confirmed the results. In addition, a disc diffusion assay showed that overexpression of AccAK reduced the resistance of Escherichia coli cells to multiple adverse stresses. Taken together, our results indicated that AccAK may be involved of great significance in response to adverse abiotic and biotic stresses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29272792>In-silico and in-vitro evaluation of human acetylcholinesterase inhibition by organophosphates.</a></h2><p>Organophosphates (OP) inhibit the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and devastate the nervous system of pest however its mode of action is ubiquitous and acts similarly on human AChE (hAChE). Screening of OP was carried out by molecular docking with hAChE using Glide docking module of Schrodinger suite as the structural information of hAChE and OP together as co-crystal structure is rarely available. The docking was done at three different precision levels, high throughput virtual screening (HTVS), standard precision and extra precision. The ranking was done using over all binding  i.e. dock score and molecular modelling generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA). Investigation reported Tryptophan (Trp86) residue involved in most interactions by forming a π-cation interaction apart from Ser203 on anionic subsite of hAChE. The top rank ligand was  ethyl phosphonate (PEP) interacting with Trp86, Gly121 and Ser203. However contact with Gly121 was lost during simulation and Asp74 appeared and sustained. Molecular dynamic simulation (GROMACS 4.5.5) of hAChE-PEP complex for 4 × 10 pico-second with SPC16 water system at 310 K temperature explained the evident role of Trp86 in stabilizing the ligand at P-site of the enzyme. Asp74 and Tyr124 were noticed in conveying H-bonds. Trp86 has shown consistent and better stability of bond based on distance between residues and ligand. The top ranked OP i.e. PEP was used to establish a dose response relationship between OP and hAChE. PEP inhibits half of the enzyme activity at concertation of 29.99 μM (calculated by sigmoid plot) at R = 0.996 and P < 0.0001.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Each year, O,O-diethyl O-(alpha-cyanobenzylideneamino) phosphorothioate () pesticide poisoning in China results in huge economic losses in sericulture. Silkworm fat body is the main organ for nutrient storage,  supply, intermediary metabolism, and detoxification. Microarray analysis of silkworm Cytochrome P450 detoxification enzyme genes revealed that all tested P450 4 (CYP4) family genes are expressed in the fat body. Quantitative Real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of CYP4 family genes in silkworm fat body 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after  exposure. The expression levels of silkworm molting hormone synthesis-related genes started to change 24 h after  exposure, with those of CYP302A1, CYP306A1, and CYP314A1 being elevated by 1.38-, 1.33-, and 2.10-fold, respectively. The CYP18A1 gene that participates in steroid hormone inactivation and the CYP15C1 gene that participates in the epoxidation during the synthesis of juvenile hormone (JH) from methyl farnesoate (MF) were increased by 3.85- and 7.82-fold, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that these endogenous hormone metabolism-related genes belong to CYP mito clan and clan 2, and that  exposure may affect silkworm development and metamorphosis. The CYP4, CYP6, and CYP9 families all showed some degrees of increases in gene expression; among them, CYP49A1, CYP4L6, CYP6AB4, CYP9G3, CYP9A19, and CYP9A22's transcription levels were significantly upregulated to 12.77-, 2.64-, 2.42-, 4.06-, 3.32-, and 2.98-fold, respectively, of the control levels. In the fat body, CYP49A1, CYP6AB4, CYP9A19, and CYP9A22 were constantly expressed at high levels after 24, 48, and 72 h of  treatments; according to phylogenetic analysis, these genes belong to detoxification-related clan 3 and clan 4 CYP families. These genes may participate in the metabolism of  in silkworm fat body. The results obtained in this study provide a basis for future in-depth investigations of insect P450 family genes in metabolic detoxification.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.
