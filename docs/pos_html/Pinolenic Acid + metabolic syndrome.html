Control (C), glucomannan (G) and glucomannan/spirulina (GS)-RP; HC (cholesterol-enriched control), HG and HGS (cholesterol-enriched glucomannan and glucomannan/spirulina-RP) experimental diets were tested. Increased  markers were found in C, G and GS rats. Cholesterol feeding increased liver size, fat, and cholesterol and reduced antioxidant enzyme levels and expressions. Cholesterolemia was lower in HG and HGS than in HC. GS vs. G showed higher stearic but lower oleic levels. SFA and PUFA decreased while MUFA increased by cholesterol feeding. The arachidonic/linoleic and docosahexaenoic/ ratios were lower in HC, HG, and HGS vs. C, G, and GS, respectively, suggesting a delta-6-elongase-desaturase system inhibition. Moreover, cholesterol feeding, mainly in HGS, decreased low-density-lipoprotein receptor expression and the delta-5-desaturase activity and increased the delta-9-desaturase activity. In conclusion, the liver production of highly unsaturated fatty acids was limited to decrease their oxidation in presence of hypercholesterolaemia. Glucomannan or glucomannan/spirulina-RP has added new attributes to their functional properties in meat, partially arresting the negative effects induced by high-fat-high-cholesterol feeding on the liver fatty  and antioxidant statuses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7938084>In vivo and in vitro effects of gamma- and eicosapentaenoic  on prostaglandin production and arachidonic  uptake by human endometrium.</a></h2><p>This study examines the effect of a 6 month dietary supplement of either gamma- (GLA) or eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) on the synthesis of prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha by the endometrium of women with regular menstrual cycles. Samples of endometrium, obtained pre- and post-treatment, were incubated in vitro for 2 h and the prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha released into the medium measured by radioimmunoassay. The ability of the tissue to take up 14C-arachidonic  before and after treatment was also examined. Both GLA and EPA caused a marked decrease in the synthesis of prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha (P < 0.001) but under the experimental conditions used, there was no consistent effect on arachidonic  uptake. Body mass index, serum testosterone, fasting insulin and serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations did not change during the 6 month treatment period. An effect of GLA and EPA on arachidonic  uptake into endometrial tissue explants was demonstrated in vitro. In the presence of both GLA and EPA, uptake into phospholipids (particularly phosphatidylcholine) decreased while uptake into triglycerides increased. Free 14C-arachidonic  levels (that which could not be removed from the tissue by washing) also increased. Suppression of endometrial prostaglandin E2 and F2 alpha synthesis following GLA or EPA supplementation can be explained as direct competition between these fatty acids and arachidonic  (the precursor of 2-series prostaglandins) for incorporation into membrane phospholipids. The amount of arachidonic  available for 2-series prostaglandin synthesis will therefore be reduced. However, other mechanisms may exist which need to be investigated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25097001>Adipose tissue n-3 fatty acids and .</a></h2><p>Evidence regarding the relationship of n-3 fatty acids (FA) to type 2 diabetes and  components (MetS) is inconsistent.To examine associations of adipose tissue n-3 FA with MetS.We studied 1611 participants without prior history of diabetes or heart disease who were participants in a population-based case-control study of diet and heart disease (The Costa Rica Heart Study). We calculated prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for MetS by quartile of n-3 FA in adipose tissue derived mainly from plants (α- (ALA)), fish (eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA)) or metabolism (docosapentaenoic  (DPA), as well as the EPA:ALA ratio, a surrogate marker of delta-6 desaturase activity).N-3 FA levels in adipose tissue were associated with MetS prevalence in opposite directions. The PR (95% CI) for the highest compared with the lowest quartile adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), residence, lifestyle, diet and other FAs were 0.60 (0.44, 0.81) for ALA, 1.43 (1.12, 1.82) for EPA, 1.63 (1.22, 2.18) for DPA and 1.47 (1.14, 1.88) for EPA:ALA, all P for trend <0.05. Although these associations were no longer significant (except DPA) after adjustment for BMI, ALA and DPA were associated with lower glucose and higher triglyceride levels, P<0.05 (respectively).These results suggest that ALA could exert a modest protective benefit, whereas EPA and DHA are not implicated in MetS. The positive associations for DPA and MetS could reflect higher delta-6 desaturase activity caused by increased adiposity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22049297>Genetic variation in stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 is associated with  prevalence in Costa Rican adults.</a></h2><p>Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) activity, a key regulator of lipid metabolism, may be associated with the development of  (MetS). We examined the association of genetic variation in the SCD1 gene with the occurrence of MetS and its five components in a population of Costa Rican adults (n = 2152; mean age, 58 y; range, 18-86 y). Associations of tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNP) of the SCD1 gene with prevalence of MetS and its five components were analyzed by use of log-Poisson models with robust variance estimates and linear regression models, respectively. The likelihood ratio was used to test potential gene-fatty  interactive effects with adipose tissue α-. One tagSNP (rs1502593) was significantly associated with an increased prevalence of MetS in the total study sample. Compared with the common homozygous CC genotype, the CT and TT genotypes for rs1502593 were associated with higher prevalence ratios (PR) of MetS for CT vs. CC: [PR = 1.22 (95% CI = 1.03, 1.44)] and for TT vs. CC [PR = 1.24 (95% CI = 1.01, 1.52)]. Among women, we observed borderline positive associations between systolic blood pressure and fasting blood sugar levels and rs1502593 (P = 0.05 and 0.06). Compared to the common haplotype (frequency ≥ 5%) with no minor alleles of SCD1 tagSNP, the other two observed common haplotypes carrying the rs1502593 minor allele were significantly associated with elevated prevalence of MetS. No gene-fatty  interactive effects were observed. Our results suggest that genetic variation in the SCD1 gene may play a role in the development of MetS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25916176>Activity of dietary fatty acids on FFA1 and FFA4 and characterisation of pinolenic  as a dual FFA1/FFA4 agonist with potential effect against  diseases.</a></h2><p>Various foods are associated with effects against  diseases such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes; however, their mechanisms of action are mostly unclear. Fatty acids may contribute by acting as precursors of signalling molecules or by direct activity on receptors. The medium- and long-chain NEFA receptor FFA1 (free fatty  receptor 1, previously known as GPR40) has been linked to enhancement of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, whereas FFA4 (free fatty  receptor 4, previously known as GPR120) has been associated with insulin-sensitising and anti-inflammatory effects, and both receptors are reported to protect pancreatic islets and promote secretion of appetite and glucose-regulating hormones. Hypothesising that FFA1 and FFA4 mediate therapeutic effects of dietary components, we screened a broad selection of NEFA on FFA1 and FFA4 and characterised active compounds in concentration-response curves. Of the screened compounds, pinolenic , a constituent of pine nut oil, was identified as a relatively potent and efficacious dual FFA1/FFA4 agonist, and its suitability for further studies was confirmed by additional in vitro characterisation. Pine nut oil and free and esterified pure pinolenic  were tested in an acute glucose tolerance test in mice. Pine nut oil showed a moderately but significantly improved glucose tolerance compared with maize oil. Pure pinolenic  or ethyl ester gave robust and highly significant improvements of glucose tolerance. In conclusion, the present results indicate that pinolenic  is a comparatively potent and efficacious dual FFA1/FFA4 agonist that exerts antidiabetic effects in an acute mouse model. The compound thus deserves attention as a potential active dietary ingredient to prevent or counteract  diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31260961>Phenolic, oxylipin and fatty  profiles of the Chilean hazelnut (Gevuina avellana): Antioxidant activity and inhibition of pro-inflammatory and -associated enzymes.</a></h2><p>Roasted cotyledons of the Chilean hazelnut (Gevuina avellana) are appreciated as snacks. The aim of our work was to assess the fatty , oxylipin and phenolic composition using gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS), ultra- high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to MS and HPLC coupled to diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). Additionally, various antioxidant activities were assessed. The inhibition of α-glucosidase, α-amylase, lipase, cyclooxygenases-1 and -2 (COX-1/COX-2), and lipoxygenase was determined. The main fatty acids were oleic and 7-hexadecenoic acids. Eight phytoprostanes and three phytofurans were identified and quantified. Hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids were the main phenolic compounds. Oils showed antioxidant activity determined by EPR, and inhibition of COX-1/COX-2. The statistical analysis showed that the roasting does not affect the composition of the samples. The occurrence of oxylipins in this species is reported for the first time. Chilean hazelnuts can be considered a source of health promoting compounds.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Nutraceuticals of natural origin are gaining importance as an alternative to modern drugs for the management of . In the present study, punicic  (PA), a major bioactive found in pomegranate seed, was subjected for biological characterization with respect to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist property in an in vitro system (3T3-L1 adipocytes). We evaluated the adipogenic potential of various concentrations (5, 10 and 30 μM) of PA by studying triglyceride accumulation and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity in adipocytes, which were found to be increased moderately compared with the positive control, i.e. rosiglitazone (RG). Glucose uptake activity (↑225.93% ± 2.55% for 30 μM of PA), and the prevention of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation (↓57 ± 1.83% for 30 μM of PA) in adipocytes with PA were also evaluated. We also found that PA increased adiponectin secretion and upregulated GLUT4 expression and translocation in adipocytes. Molecular modelling studies revealed a high binding affinity of PA to the PPARγ ligand binding domain. An in vitro ligand binding assay based on time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) also proved PA as a PPARγ agonist. Finally, we conclude that PA is a potential nutraceutical and should be encouraged for use both as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23975575>Dietary fat in relation to erythrocyte fatty  composition in men.</a></h2><p>Erythrocyte membrane fatty  (EMFA) composition is used in the validation of food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) and the evaluation of dietary fat quality. In this cross-sectional study we aimed to investigate associations of diet with EMFA. Altogether, 1,033 randomly selected Finnish men, aged from 47 to 75 years filled in a FFQ and their EMFA composition was analyzed. Marine polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) intake correlated positively with erythrocyte eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (r(s) = 0.415 and r(s) = 0.340, respectively, P < 0.001) and inversely with all n-6 PUFA analyzed (P < 0.001). PUFA intake from spreads and cooking fats correlated positively with  (ALA), linoleic (LNA) and nervonic acids (r(s) = 0.229, r(s) = 0.160 and r(s) = 0.143, respectively, P < 0.001). Milk fat intake was associated with myristic and behenic acids (r(s) = 0.186 and r(s) = 0.132, respectively P < 0.001). Butter users had lower ALA and LNA proportions (mol%) than non-users (0.16 ± 0.04 vs. 0.19 ± 0.05, P < 0.001 and 7.77 ± 1.02 vs. 8.12 ± 1.11, P = 0.001). Higher PUFA intake from meat was related to decreased long-chain n-3 (P < 0.001) and increased n-6 PUFA (P < 0.001) proportions. In conclusion, EMFA composition reflects particularly well the intakes of n-3 PUFA, whereas other associations remained lower. Yet, all main sources of dietary fat were related with EMFA. The dietary effect on the nervonic  proportion was confirmed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9640074>[The role of nutrition on the treatment of septic  and multiple organ failure].</a></h2><p>Basing on current literature the issues regarding nutrition in patients with septic  and multiple organ failure were discussed. It was emphasised that patient feeding along with providing  substrates also serves as a treatment method. Diet ingredients in specific carbohydrate, protein and fat metabolism disorders were analysed. We focused upon the role of emulsion of fat, especially medium chain triglycerides (MCT) and -3- (fish oil). The unique role o f glutamine, arginine and branched chain amino acids (BCA) was highlighted.

Our earlier studies have demonstrated that vitamin B12 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are interlinked in the one carbon cycle. The present study for the first time examines the effect of maternal n-3 PUFA supplementation to vitamin B12 deficient or supplemented diets on pregnancy outcome, fatty- status and  variables in Wistar rats. Pregnant dams were assigned to one of the following groups: control, vitamin B12 deficient, vitamin B12 supplemented, vitamin B12 deficient + n-3 PUFA or vitamin B12 supplemented + n-3 PUFA. The amount of vitamin B12 in the supplemented group was 0.50 μg kg(-1) diet and n-3 PUFA was  (ALA) 1.68, eicosapentaenoic  5.64, docosahexaenoic  (DHA) 3.15 (g per 100g fatty acids per kg diet). Our findings indicate that maternal vitamin B12 supplementation did not affect the weight gain of dams during pregnancy but reduced litter size and weight and was ameliorated by n-3 PUFA supplementation. Vitamin B12 deficiency or supplementation resulted in a low percentage distribution of plasma arachidonic  and DHA. n-3 PUFA supplementation to these diets improved the fatty- status. Vitamin B12 deficiency resulted in higher homocysteine and insulin levels, which were normalised by supplementation with either vitamin B12 or n-3 PUFA. Our study suggests that maternal vitamin B12 status is critical in determining pregnancy outcome and  variables in dams and that supplementation with n-3 PUFA is beneficial.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31416272>Dietary Fat Intake and  in Older Adults.</a></h2><p> (MetS) is associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cancer worldwide.To assess fat intake in older adults with or without MetS.Cross-sectional nutritional survey in older adults living in the Balearic Islands ( = 477, 48% women, 55-80 years old) with no previous CVD.Assessment of fat (total fat, MUFA, PUFA, SFA, TFA, linoleic , α-, marine and non-marine ω-3 FA, animal fat and vegetable fat, cholesterol) and macronutrient intake using a validated food frequency questionnaire, and its comparison with recommendations of the US Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the Spanish Society of Community Nutrition (SENC).Participants with MetS showed higher BMI, lower physical activity, higher total fat and MUFA intake, and lower intake of energy, carbohydrates, and fiber than participants without MetS. Men and women with MetS were below the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) proposed by IOM for carbohydrates and above the AMDR for total fat and MUFAs, and women were below the AMDR proposed for α- (ALA) compared with participants without MetS.Subjects with MetS were less likely to meet IOM and SENC recommendations for fat and macronutrient intakes as compared to non-MetS subjects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23333092>Responses to oleic, linoleic and α- acids in high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet-induced  in rats.</a></h2><p>We investigated the changes in adiposity, cardiovascular and liver structure and function, and tissue fatty  compositions in response to oleic -rich macadamia oil, linoleic -rich safflower oil and α--rich flaxseed oil (C18 unsaturated fatty acids) in rats fed either a diet high in simple sugars and mainly saturated fats or a diet high in polysaccharides (cornstarch) and low in fat. The fatty acids induced lipid redistribution away from the abdomen, more pronounced with increasing unsaturation; only oleic  increased whole-body adiposity. Oleic  decreased plasma total cholesterol without changing triglycerides and nonesterified fatty acids, whereas linoleic and α- acids decreased plasma triglycerides and nonesterified fatty acids but not cholesterol. α- improved left ventricular structure and function, diastolic stiffness and systolic blood pressure. Neither oleic nor linoleic  changed the left ventricular remodeling induced by high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet, but both induced dilation of the left ventricle and functional deterioration in low fat-diet-fed rats. α- improved glucose tolerance, while oleic and linoleic acids increased basal plasma glucose concentrations. Oleic and α- acids, but not linoleic , normalized systolic blood pressure. Only oleic  reduced plasma markers of liver damage. The C18 unsaturated fatty acids reduced trans fatty acids in the heart, liver and skeletal muscle with lowered stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 activity index; linoleic and α- acids increased accumulation of their C22 elongated products.

However, the results are still controversial. We aimed to investigate the association of serum phospholipid PUFAs with cardiometabolic risk through cross-sectional/experimental studies.Serum phospholipid FA compositions and cardiometabolic risk parameters were measured in controls [healthy: n=987,  (MetS): n=214] and CAD patients (CAD-only: n=152, CAD+MetS: n=56). Experimental assays were performed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).Major cardiometabolic risk markers, i.e. insulin resistance, hs-C-reactive proteins, and malondialdehyde were higher, and adiponectin and LDL particle size were lower in CAD patients, particularly those with MetS than in healthy controls. Serum linoleic  (LA, C18:2ω-6) was lowest and dihomo-γ- acids (DGLAs, C20:3ω-6) were highest in CAD patients with MetS among the 4 groups. Docosahexaenoic  (DHA, C22:6ω-3) was lower and arachidonic  (AA, C20:4ω-6) and ω6/ω3-PUFAs were higher in CAD patients than in controls. ω3-PUFAs were significantly lower in CAD patients, particularly those with MetS than in healthy controls. Multiple regression analysis revealed that AA and DHA among serum FAs were mainly associated with the cardiometabolic risk (β'-coefficients for AA:0.336; DHA: -0.296) together with age, MetS factors, LA, DGLA and gender (r=0.529, p<0.001). Under LPS-induced stress condition, LA and DHA significantly suppressed VSMC proliferation. DHA also up-regulated the phosphorylation of p38 and ERK, and dramatically inhibited nuclear translocation of NF-κB-p65 in VSMCs.AA and DHA were mainly associated with cardiometabolic risk.

Compared to HFD, TC, LDL-C and TG concentrations were significantly lower (p < 0.01) in hamsters consumed HFD plus ALA-PE for 1-4 times per day but there were not remarkable differences among different consumption frequencies. No significant changes in plasma antioxidant capacity and lipid peroxidation levels were observed among HFD and HFD plus different doses of ALA-PE groups. The contents of hepatic α- (ALA), docosapentaenoic (DPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids were dose-dependently increased in different ALA-PE groups compared to those in HFD group. The abundance of mRNA for intestinal sterol transporters Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCG5 and ABCG8 indicated no significant differences among all groups.ALA-PE dose-dependently improved lipid profile in hamsters fed HFD independent of intestinal ABCG5, ABCG8 and NPC1L1, accompanying by increased conversion of ALA to DPA and DHA in liver.

It is an indicator of a disease emerging though fuzzy, dynamic, complex, nonspecific and subjective. Ginseng is regarded as the king of herbs. It is famous for the function of replenishing qi in traditional Chinese medicine. It has treatment potential for DE caused by various reasons. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of ginseng treating symptom DE with the method of metabolomics.Thirty-five rats were randomly divided into three groups: normal control group, DE model group and ginseng treatment group. The DE model rats were administered daily with ginseng decoctiondecoctiondecoction intragastrically and others with water for 15 days. Urine was analyzed with ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were built to distinguish the three groups in this study and find potential biomarkers.The three groups are clearly separated and find out their  distinction in PCA score plots. It showed that the  profile of ginseng treatment group was changed to normal control group after administration of ginseng. Fifteen potential biomarkers are identified by OPLS-DA including Xanthurenic , kynurenic , Pantothenic , which are chiefly involved in tryptophan metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, citric  cycle, bile  biosynthesis,  and linoleic  metabolism. These biomarkers and the networks of their corresponding pathways will help to explain the mechanism of DE and ginseng treatment.The results of blood biochemical indicators routine and urinary metabonomic reveal that ginseng have good abilities to regulate the energy metabolism, immune function and antioxidant activities. And UPLC-Q-TOF-MS-based metabolomics can provide useful information for the understanding of  changes in DE rats after administration of ginseng in urine. The biomarkers and their corresponding pathways will provide further information of the mechanisms of ginseng in treating DE.

Two-way ANOVA analysis showed that LA interacts with rs174547 in  gene to affect HDL-c ( < 0.05) among vegetarians. The present findings suggest the need to develop dietary guidelines for vegetarians in Malaysia. Prospective studies are also needed to affirm the interaction between LA and rs174547 in  gene on HDL-c among Malaysian vegetarians.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29233142>Role of disturbed fatty acids metabolism in the pathophysiology of diabetic erectile dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Vasculogenic erectile dysfunction (VED) is considered as a common complication among people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We tested whether changes in fatty  (FAs) classes measured in erythrocytes are associated with increased risk of diabetic VED along with related risk factors.We assessed erythrocyte FAs composition, lipid peroxidation parameters and inflammatory cytokines among 72 T2D men with VED, 78 T2D men without VED and 88 healthy volunteers with similar age. Biochemical, hepatic, lipid and hormonal profiles were measured.T2D people with VED had significant decrease in the indexes of Δ6-desaturase and elongase activities compared to the other studied groups. The same group of participants displayed lower erythrocytes levels of dihomo-γ- (C20:3n-6) (P < .001), precursor of the messenger molecule PGE1 mainly involved in promoting erection. Moreover, absolute SFAs concentration and HOMA IR levels were higher in T2D people with VED when compared to controls and associated with impaired NO concentration (1.43 vs 3.30 ng/L, P < .001). Our results showed that IL-6 and TNF-α were significantly increased and positively correlated with MDA levels only in T2D people with VED (r = 0.884, P = .016 and r = 0.753, P = .035; respectively) suggesting a decrease in the relative availability of vasodilator mediators and an activation of vasoconstrictors release.Our findings show that the deranged FAs metabolism represents a potential marker of VED in progress, or at least an indicator of increased risk within men with T2D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21762726>Omega-3 fatty acids and : effects and emerging mechanisms of action.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological, human, animal, and cell culture studies show that n-3 fatty acids, especially α- (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), reduce the risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. EPA and DHA, rather than ALA, have been the focus of research on the n-3 fatty acids, probably due to the relatively inefficient conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA in rodents and humans.

However, linezolid caused severe adverse reactions, such as thrombocytopenia, anaemia, optic neuropathy, and near-fatal serotonin . In order to investigate the toxicity of linezolid, twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into: control group (n=7), low-group (n=8), and high-group (n=9). The rats of low-group and high-group were given by gavage with linezolid 60 and 120 mg/kg/day for 7 days, respectively. The serum concentration of linezolid was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); blood  change was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration in HepG2-C3A after being cultured with linezolid was determined by HPLC. The results showed that there were six metabolites and nine metabolites had statistical differences in low-group and high-group (P<0.05). The trimethyl phosphate was the most significant indicator in those changed metabolites. Except for d-glucose which was slightly increased in low-group, octadecanoic , cholest-5-ene, hexadecanoic , -, eicosapentaenoic , 9,12-Octadecadienoic , and docosahexaenoic  were all decreased in low-group and high-group.

The main purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between fatty  content of triglyceride (TG), visceral adipose tissue (AT) accumulation, and  components of the insulin resistance  in a group of 97 Caucasian men with a mean age of 45.1 +/- 7.2 years (29 to 63 years). To reach these objectives, Spearman correlations, group comparisons, and stepwise multiple regression analyses were performed. The proportion of palmitic  (16:0) in the TG fraction was positively associated with plasma fasting insulin (r =.25, P =.03), diastolic (r =.45, P <.001), and systolic (r =.29, P =.003) blood pressure. On the other hand, the proportion of  (18:3n-3) was associated negatively with apolipoprotein (apo) B (r = -.29, P =.005) and positively with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) diameter (r =.29, P =.007), while the proportion of gamma- (18:3n-6) was associated negatively with plasma TG (r = -.33, P =.003), diastolic (r = -.29, P =.01), and systolic (r = -.35, P =.002) blood pressure and plasma fasting insulin (r = -.37, P =.0005) and positively with high-density lipoprotein (HDL)(2)-cholesterol (r =.27, P =.01) and LDL diameter (r =.25, P =.02). Stepwise multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine the contribution of visceral AT, body fat mass, and the fatty  content of TG to the variance of  variables studied. It was found that visceral AT contributed significantly to the variance in plasma TG (R(2) = 20.7%, P <.0001), apo B (R(2) = 9.0%, P =.007), HDL(2)-cholesterol (R(2) = 17.9%, P <.0001), LDL diameter (R(2) = 4.9%, P =.02), and area under the glucose curve (AUC-glucose) (R(2) = 8.2%, P =.006). On the other hand, body fat mass contributed significantly to the variance in fasting insulin (R(2) = 19.7%, P <.0001) and diastolic (R(2) = 6.8%, P =.007) and systolic (R(2) = 10.5%, P =.01) blood pressure. At least one fatty  made a significant contribution to the variance of each  variable studied. In fact, the proportion of 18:3n-6 contributed significantly to the variance in both TG (R(2) = 8.9%, P = 0.007) and HDL(2)-cholesterol (R(2) = 6.0%, P =.01). Moreover, 18:3n-3 contributed to the variance of apo B (R(2) = 7.0%, P =.02), while 18:3n-6 made the largest contribution to the variance of LDL diameter (R(2) = 7.6%, P =.02). Finally, 16:0 significantly contributed to the variance of AUC-glucose (R(2) = 11.4%, P =.0003), diastolic (R(2) = 25.2%, P <.0001), and systolic (R(2) = 6.8%, P =.002) blood pressure.

The present study was undertaken to define the inhibitory effects of saturated NEFAs on EDR (endothelium-dependent relaxation). Experiments were performed in rings of rabbit aorta to establish (i) dose-response relationships, (ii) the effect of chain length, (iii) the effect of the presence of double bonds, (iv) reversibility and time course of inhibition, and (v) the effect on nitric oxide production. Aortic rings were incubated (1 h) with NEFA-albumin complexes derived from lauric (C(12:0)), myristic (C(14:0)), palmitic (C(16:0)), stearic (C(18:0)) and  (C(18:3)) acids. EDR induced by acetylcholine (0.1-10 mumol/l) was measured after pre-contraction with noradrenaline. Inhibition of EDR was dose-dependent (0.5-2 mmol/l NEFA), and the greatest inhibition (51%) was observed with stearic  (2 mmol/l). Lauric  had the smallest inhibitory effect. The inhibitory effects were always reversible and were evident after 15 min of incubation.  caused a significantly lower inhibition of EDR than stearic . SOD (superoxide dismutase) restored the inhibitory effect caused by NEFAs, suggesting the involvement of ROS (reactive oxygen species) in removing nitric oxide. The nitric oxide concentration measured after exposure of the rings to acetylcholine was lower after incubation with NEFAs than with Krebs buffer alone. This finding is consistent with removal of nitric oxide by ROS. This claim was supported by the demonstration of increased concentrations of nitrated tyrosine in the rings incubated with NEFAs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22962535>Plasma phospholipid fatty  composition and estimated desaturase activity in heart failure patients with .</a></h2><p> is one of the major factors to increase the incidence of heart failure.

We hypothesize that eicosapentaenoic/gamma--induced apoptosis involves downstream  products of lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase enzymes. This study determined the effects of inhibitors of lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase enzymes on eicosapentaenoic/gamma--treated HL-60 cells.Cells were incubated with 50 microM eicosapentaenoic/20 microM gamma- in the presence of an enzyme inhibitor (1-10 microM) for 12 hours. Compounds were used to inhibit cyclooxygenase (ibuprofen), 12-lipoxygenase (baicalein), or 5-lipoxygenase (AA-861). Flow cytometry assessed viability, apoptosis, and necrosis.5-Lipoxygenase inhibition decreased cell viability and increased cell death (apoptosis + necrosis) in eicosapentaenoic/gamma--treated HL-60 cells. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 and 12-lipoxygenase had no significant effect on cellular viability and death in eicosapentaenoic/gamma--treated HL-60 cells. Adding leukotriene B4 counteracted the effect of 5-lipoxygenase inhibition on apoptosis in eicosapentaenoic/gamma--treated HL-60 cells.These data suggest that the processing of eicosapentaenoic and gamma- by 5-lipoxygenase is critical to HL-60 cell survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17898498>The role of consumption of , eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids in human  and type 2 diabetes--a mini-review.</a></h2><p>The human  and its frequent sequela, type 2 diabetes are epidemic around the world.  (ALA, 18:3 n-3), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, 20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6 n-3) consumption ameliorates some of these epidemics' features thus leading one to question if consumption of EPA and DHA, and their  precursor ALA reduce the conversion of  to type 2 diabetes and reduce the major cause of death in the  and type 2 diabetes-myocardial infarction. Contributing to myocardial infarction are 's features of dyslipidemia (including elevated total cholesterol and LDL-c), oxidation, inflammation, hypertension, glucose intolerance, overweight and obesity. Inflammation, glucose and lipid levels are variously influenced by disturbances in various adipocytokines which are in turn positively impacted by n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  consumption. Type 2 diabetes has all these features though elevated total cholesterol and LDL-c are rarer. It is concluded that EPA and DHA consumption significantly benefits  and type 2 diabetes primarily in terms of dyslipidemia (particularly hypertriglyceridemia) and platelet aggregation with their impact on blood pressure, glucose control, inflammation and oxidation being less established.

Flaxseed, flax oil, and FLC had variable effects on BP in humans, while SDG and FPH significantly reduced the BP in SDR and SHR. The effect of SDG was dose-dependent and long lasting. The lowering of BP is mediated through inhibition of soluble epoxide by  - in flax oil, stimulation of guanylate cyclase and inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by SDG, and inhibition of renin and ACE activity by FPH. Flaxseed, flax oil, and FLC have variable effects on BP (none, slight, and significant). They are effective in lowering BP in individuals with hypertension and  but ineffective in healthy individuals' ineffectiveness of flaxseed and its compounds in lowering BP may be due to their low doses, long interval of dosing, short duration of consumption, and patient status. In conclusion, the data at present suggest that flaxseed, flax oil, and FLC cannot serve as therapeutic agents for the treatment of hypertension. However, they can be used as an adjunct in the treatment of hypertension. A clinical trial should be conducted of these agents with higher doses which would be given twice daily for long duration.

Two UFAs, dihomo-gamma- and palmitoleic , were also able to predict the future development of  (MS) in a group of obese subjects.These findings underscore the potential role of UFAs in the MS pathogenesis and also as important markers in predicting the risk of developing diabetes in obese individuals or diabetes remission after a  surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25935580>Association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in erythrocytes and  in Chinese men and women.</a></h2><p>Evidence of an association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and  (MS) is limited and inconsistent.

Various (n-3) fatty acids (FA) have been reported to have antiinflammatory effects, but there is a lack of consensus in this area, particularly in regard to optimal source(s) and dose(s). This study aimed to determine the effects of high and low doses of (n-3) FA from plant and marine sources on plasma inflammatory marker concentrations. One-hundred adults with  were randomly assigned to a low or high dose of plant- (2.2 or 6.6 g/d α-) or marine- (1.2 or 3.6 g/d EPA and DHA) derived (n-3) FA or placebo for 8 wk, using a parallel arm design (n = 20/arm). Fasting blood samples collected at 0, 4, and 8 wk were analyzed for concentrations of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), IL-6, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and for cardiovascular risk factors. Baseline concentrations across all 5 groups combined were (mean ± SD) 103 ± 32 ng/L for MCP-1, 1.06 ± 0.56 ng/L for IL-6, and 0.197 ± 0.041 ng/L for sICAM-1. There were no significant differences in 8-wk changes in plasma inflammatory marker concentrations among the 5 groups. Plasma TG and blood pressure decreased significantly more and the LDL cholesterol concentration increased more in the high-dose fish oil group compared to the 8-wk changes in some of the other 4 groups (P ≤ 0.04).

Therefore, this review examines what is currently known about the specific effects of the major n - 3 and n - 6 PUFA on CVD and NAFLD.

These variations in magnitude may be directly ascribed to differences in the channeling of lipids toward oxidation or storage. A study was designed to compare the effects of 4 dietary fats on postprandial energy expenditure and on some risk factors of the . To avoid usual confounding factors due to simultaneous variations in chain length and double-bounds number of fatty acids, dietary fats were chosen to provide mainly 18-carbon fatty acids with 0 (stearic  [SA]), 1 (oleic  [OA]), 2 (linoleic  [LA]), or 3 ( [ALA]) double bounds. They were given as single high-fat test meals to 4 different groups of male rats. The resting  rate and the lipid and carbohydrate oxidation were measured from oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production using indirect calorimetry 2 hours before and 6.5 hours after the test meal. Plasma glucose, triglyceride, and chylomicron concentrations were determined at 0, 1.5, and 4 hours after the test meal. Postprandial concentration of glucose and triglyceride did not vary with the nature of the test meals, whereas that of chylomicrons was the highest after the LA test meal and the lowest after the SA test meal. Postprandial increase in resting  rate was the highest after the LA and OA test meals, and the lowest after the SA and ALA test meals. Compared with the 3 other diets, the ALA test meal enhanced lipid oxidation and decreased glucose oxidation during the early postprandial period (0.25-3.25 hours). This suggests that stearic  may not induce all the adverse effects classically described for other saturated fatty acids and that  may beneficially influence energy partitioning, especially during the early postprandial state.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Adherence to these recommendations allows not only to stop the progression of a disease but also to improve the overall health of elderly patients.The aim of this study was to analyze differences in nutrition of elderly patients, with emphasis on the implementation of nutritional recommendations both for healthy people and for patients with cardiometabolic disorders.Based on a 24-hour recall questionnaire of 239 volunteers (mean age, 72 ±9.34 years) and using the Diet 5.0 software, we analyzed in detail the pattern of consumption of various nutrients.Compared with the recommendations of the World Health Organization and cardiology associations, more than 90% of the population did not cover the demand for calcium, potassium, vitamin D, folic , and α-. The intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids, sodium, magnesium, fiber, water, and vitamin C was slightly higher. The appropriate intake was observed only in a diet of 15% to 40% of the subjects. The most significant differences were demonstrated for the coexisting diseases and the intake level of sodium, polyunsaturated fatty acids (particularly docosahexaenoic ) vitamin C, iron, fiber, lauric , and sucrose. The diet of patients with hypercholesterolemia was the least deficient, while deficiencies were the most common in patients with a history of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure.Nutrition of geriatric patients is inadequate. Their diet is profoundly deficient in nutrients, and these deficiencies further deteriorate in the presence of cardiovascular or  diseases.

Nowadays, in the adult population of Europe it is estimated at 14% to 21%. Its most important risk factors are obesity and . Introducing lifestyle changes such as: dietary intervention and increased physical activity are the first-line treatment and are intended to support not only NAFLD but also associated diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes and dyslipidemia. Dietary management focuses on weight reduction of overweight or obese people by decreasing energy in diet. It is recommended to limit the intake of saturated fats and trans fatty acids as well as cholesterol. Instead, it is important to increase the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty  diets, mainly from the n-3 family, which exhibit anti-inflammatory activity. It is also beneficial to eat nuts, despite their high energy value, as a source of , which lowers LDL cholesterol. It is important to increase the share of vegetable protein (eg. soya) and limit the intake of fat meat, milk and the dairy products. A key role in the treatment and prevention of NAFLD is also a reduction of simple sugars and total exclusion of added sugar in the diet. The rise of NAFLD in developed countries is analogous to the increase of fructose consumption, which high intake is directly indicated as the main cause of the disease. Choosing foods with high fiber content, low glycemic index and meals composed with low glycemic load, is conducive to weight reduction. An important role in supporting NAFLD treatment is also attributed to vitamin D, C and E supplementation and some probiotic bacteria, as well as cinnamon and turmeric, which improve insulin sensitivity. Daily physical activity is strongly recommended as the supplement of healthy lifestyle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7594424>Relationships of blood pressure to fibrinolysis: influence of anthropometry,  profile and behavioural variables.</a></h2><p>To investigate the relationship between blood pressure and the plasma fibrinolytic system and to verify whether this association was independent or mediated by one or more potential confounding factor.A random sample of 94 males aged 38 years subdivided into normotensives, hypertensives and those hypertensives with the highest blood pressure values.Overall and regional obesity, blood lipids, fasting and 2-h post-load glucose, C-peptide and insulin levels, and main behavioural variables, including adipose tissue fatty  composition (an objective index of dietary fat intake), were measured. The plasma fibrinolytic system was evaluated by determining activities and total plasma concentrations of both tissue-type plasminogen activator before and after venous occlusion, and its inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1).PAI-1 activity was significantly higher in the hypertensives than in the normotensives. PAI-1 antigen tended to parallel PAI-1 activity, and levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator antigen and activity tended to be lower in the hypertensives at baseline and after venous occlusion, but not significantly different from those in the normotensives. The hypertensives also had significantly higher body mass index and body fat content (measured by bio-impedance), increased plasma triglycerides, uric , fasting and 2-h glucose, C-peptide and insulin concentrations. In univariate linear regression analysis both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were found to be positively correlated with PAI-1 levels (r = 0.27, P < 0.01, for both). This correlation was maintained after adjustment for total body fat, fasting glucose, fasting insulin concentration or adipose tissue ; however, it was no longer significant after adjustment for plasma 2-h insulin, 2-h C-peptide, 2-h glucose or triglyceride levels. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that only 2-h insulin and triglyceride concentration showed an independent association with PAI-1 levels.This study confirms that, in 38-year-old males, hypertension is associated with increased PAI-1 activity. It supports the possibility that the relationship between blood pressure and PAI-1 may reflect the overall effect of the insulin resistance  (in particular hyperinsulinaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia) rather than a direct effect of blood pressure on the fibrinolytic system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25080537>A dietary biomarker approach captures compliance and cardiometabolic effects of a healthy Nordic diet in individuals with .</a></h2><p>Assessment of compliance with dietary interventions is necessary to understand the observed magnitude of the health effects of the diet per se. To avoid reporting bias, different dietary biomarkers (DBs) could be used instead of self-reported data. However, few studies investigated a combination of DBs to assess compliance and its influence on cardiometabolic risk factors. The objectives of this study were to use a combination of DBs to assess compliance and to investigate how a healthy Nordic diet (ND) influences cardiometabolic risk factors in participants with high apparent compliance compared with the whole study population. From a recently conducted isocaloric randomized trial, SYSDIET (Systems Biology in Controlled Dietary Interventions and Cohort Studies), in 166 individuals with , several DBs were assessed to reflect different key components of the ND: canola oil (serum phospholipid α-), fatty fish [eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA)], vegetables (plasma β-carotene), and whole grains (plasma alkylresorcinols). High-fat dairy intake (expectedly low in the ND) was reflected by serum pentadecanoic . All participants with biomarker data (n = 154) were included in the analyses. Biomarkers were combined by using a biomarker rank score (DB score) and principal component analysis (PCA). The DB score was then used to assess compliance. During the intervention, median concentrations of alkylresorcinols, α-, EPA, and DHA were >25% higher in the ND individuals than in the controls (P < 0.05), whereas median concentrations of pentadecanoic  were 14% higher in controls (P < 0.05). Median DB score was 57% higher in the ND than in controls (P < 0.001) during the intervention, and participants were ranked similarly by DB score and PCA score. Overall, estimates of group difference in cardiometabolic effects generally appeared to be greater among compliant participants than in the whole study population (e.g., estimates of treatment effects on blood pressure and lipoproteins were ∼1.5- to 2-fold greater in the most compliant participants), suggesting that poor compliance attenuated the dietary effects. With adequate consideration of their limitations, DB combinations (e.g., DB score) could be useful for assessing compliance in intervention studies investigating cardiometabolic effects of healthy dietary patterns.

Clinically, the blocking stimulation of the endocannabinoid pathway has been one of the first approaches proposed to counteract the obesity and obesity-associated diseases (such as diabetes,  and cancer). In this connection, here we studied in cultured 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes the effects of n-3-PUFA, α- (OM-3), n-6-PUFA, Linoleic  (OM-6), and hydroxytyrosol (HT) on the expression of CB1 receptor gene and the adipogenesis-related genes PPAR-γ, Fatty  Synthase (FAS) and Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL). HT was able to inhibit 3T3-L1 cell differentiation by down-regulating cell proliferation and CB1 receptor gene expression. HT exhibited anti-adipogenic effects, whereas OM-3 and OM-6 exerted an inhibitory action on cell proliferation associated with an induction of the preadipocytes differentiation and CB1 receptor gene expression. Moreover, the expression of FAS and LPL genes resulted increased after treatment with both HT and OM-3 and OM-6. The present study points out that the intake of molecules such as HT, contained in extra virgin olive oil, may be considered also in view of antiobesity and antineoplastic properties by acting directly on the adipose tissue and modulating CB1 receptor gene transcription.© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24720591>Polyunsaturated fatty acids in pregnancy and : a review.</a></h2><p>This review presents available evidence for possible application of n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in pregnant obese women with  (MS) and focuses on prophylaxis of pregnancy complications associated with MS such as gestational hypertension, preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. Dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFAs has recently become popular and their adequate intake during pregnancy and early childhood is of clinical importance. The results of experimental and epidemiological investigations reveal that n-3 PUFAs, especially α-  (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), may decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases. It is believed that n-3 PUFAs affect a multitude of molecular pathways, involving regulation of gene expression, alteration of physical and chemical properties of cellular membranes and modulation of membrane channels and proteins. A large body of evidence focuses on anti-inflammatory properties of PUFAs which seem to be fundamental in prevention and reversing of insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidemia, hypertension, thromboembolism and in improving vascular function. Despite the potential PUFAs benefits of decreasing insulin resistance, their application in order to prevent preeclampsia, gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus in pregnant women with MS has not yet been established. Numerous reports have revealed that appropriate fetal development, including neuronal, retinal and immune function depends on EPA and DHA which are crucial also for prevention of preterm birth. Thus the supplementation with EPA and DHA is highly recommended during pregnancy although the optimal dosing and treatment strategies still need to be determined.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19144731>Does genetic variation in the Delta6-desaturase promoter modify the association between  and the prevalence of ?</a></h2><p>Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) are associated with protection against components of the , but the role of  (ALA), the  precursor of EPA and DHA, has not been studied.

Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by reduced vasodilation and a pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic state, and is an early pathological event in the development of atherosclerosis. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD), a gold standard for assessing endothelial dysfunction, is a predictor of future cardiovascular events and coronary heart disease risk. Notably, risk factors for endothelial dysfunction include classic risk factors for atherosclerosis: Elevated lipids, diabetes, hypertension, elevated BMI, cigarette smoking, and . In this paper, we review the ability of n-3 PUFAs to improve endothelial dysfunction in individuals with classic risk factors for atherosclerosis, but lacking diagnosed atherosclerotic disease, with the goal of identifying those individuals that might gain the most vasoprotection from n-3 PUFA supplements. We include trials using eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), or  (ALA) alone, or EPA+DHA; and assessing endothelial function by FMD, forearm blood flow, or peripheral arterial tonometry. We found that n-3 PUFAs improved endothelial dysfunction in 16 of 17 studies in individuals with hyperlipidemia, elevated BMI, , or that smoked cigarettes, but only in 2 of 5 studies in diabetics. Further, these trials showed that use of EPA+DHA consistently improve endothelial dysfunction; ALA-enriched diets appear promising; but use of EPA or DHA alone requires further study. We conclude that individuals with hyperlipidemia, elevated BMI, , or that smoke could derive vaosprotective benefits from EPA+DHA supplementation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We also measured the presence of MS, insulin resistance with the homeostasis model assessment, and interleukin 6 and C-reactive protein concentrations in the adolescents.MS was present in 25% of the overweight adolescents but in none of the normal-weight adolescents. Compared with overweight adolescents, normal-weight adolescents had lower saturated FAs (SFAs) in both phospholipids (P < 0.001) and CEs (P < 0.01) and higher docosahexaenoic  in phospholipids (P < 0.001). In overweight subjects, FA composition was associated with MS features independent of body fat. The odds ratios of MS for a 0.1 increase in the ratio of polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) to SFAs (PUFA:SFA) were 0.91 in phospholipids (P = 0.03) and 0.90 in CEs (P = 0.06). In phospholipids, PUFA:SFA and linoleic  were associated positively with HDL cholesterol (P < 0.01 for both). PUFA:SFA in phospholipids and CEs were associated inversely with interleukin 6 (P < 0.05 for both). Eicosapentaenoic  in phospholipids (P = 0.06) and CEs (P < 0.05) and  in CEs (P < 0.05) were inversely related to C-reactive protein. These relations remained significant after adjustment for the waist-to-hip ratio. No significant relation between FA composition and the homeostasis model assessment was observed.Plasma FA composition is associated with weight status in healthy adolescents.

The composition of plasma FA and red blood cells was analyzed on a gas-liquid chromatograph. An enzyme immunoassay was used to measure the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and eicosanoids (thromboxane B2, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1α, leukotriene B4). A biologically active additive from the king crab (Paralithodes camtschatica) hepatopancreas was used as a source of ω-3 PUFA.Having a higher proportion of linoleic and α- acids in the plasma, the patients were found to have decreased levels of ω-3 and ω-6 PUFAs (linoleic and α-, arachidonic, and eicosapentaenoic acids) and a larger proportion of Mead  and saturated FAs (myristic and stearic acids) in the red blood cells, suggesting that that cellular blood FA transfer was impaired and FAs were absorbed by cells.

The long-term (6- and 12-month) use of ω-3 PUFA from the king crab hepatopancreas had a positive impact in modifying the lipid FA composition of red blood cells and in eliminating deficiencies of physiologically important ω-3 and ω-6 PUFAs in the blood cells.The findings suggest that FAs and their metabolites play an important role in the pathogenesis of MS and that dietary ω-3 PUFA should be incorporated into a package of preventive and therapeutic measures for MS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23456976>N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids: relationship to inflammation in healthy adults and adults exhibiting features of .</a></h2><p>Individuals with  (MetS) have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, therefore, research has been directed at reducing various components that contribute to MetS and associated  impairments, including chronic low-grade inflammation. Epidemiological, human, animal and cell culture studies provide evidence that dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), including  (18:3n-3, ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (20:5n-3, EPA) and/or docosahexaenoic  (22:6n-3, DHA) may improve some of the components associated with MetS. The current review will discuss recent evidence from human observational and intervention studies that focused on the effects of ALA, EPA or DHA on inflammatory markers in healthy adults and those with one or more features of MetS. Observational studies in healthy adults support the recommendation that a diet rich in n-3 fatty acids may play a role in preventing and reducing inflammation, whereas intervention studies in healthy adults have yielded inconsistent results. The majority of intervention studies in adults with features of MetS have reported a benefit for some inflammatory measures; however, other studies using high n-3 fatty  doses and long supplementation periods have reported no effect.

Thus, altered prostaglandin metabolism may contribute to the pathophysiology of respiratory distress  (RDS). Twenty-one infants with RDS and ten age- and weight-matched controls were studied by analyzing their plasma for prostaglandins and their precursor essential fatty acids. The two groups showed no differences in the essential fatty  prostaglandin precursors, dihomo-gamma- and arachidonic acids. During the acute phase of RDS, plasma levels of the primary prostaglandins E and F are significantly elevated compared with control values and the ratio of prostaglandin E to prostaglandin F significantly reduced. Prostaglandins E and F returned to control values on recovery from the acute stage of the disease. Two infants with persistent patent ductus arteriosus had significantly elevated prostglandin E values in their plasma compared with controls. The elevated levels of circulating plasma prostaglandins E and F and the reversal of their ratio during the acute phase of RDS may have adverse pulmonary and multisystem effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23026492>Effects of ALA, EPA and DHA in high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet-induced  in rats.</a></h2><p>We compared the cardiovascular, hepatic and  responses to individual dietary n-3 fatty acids (α-, ALA; eicosapentaenoic , EPA; and docosahexaenoic , DHA) in a high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet-induced model of  in rats. Additionally, we measured fatty  composition of plasma, adipose tissue, liver, heart and skeletal muscle in these rats. The same dosages of ALA and EPA/DHA produced different physiological responses to decrease the risk factors for . ALA did not reduce total body fat but induced lipid redistribution away from the abdominal area and favorably improved glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, dyslipidemia, hypertension and left ventricular dimensions, contractility, volumes and stiffness. EPA and DHA increased sympathetic activation, reduced the abdominal adiposity and total body fat and attenuated insulin sensitivity, dyslipidemia, hypertension and left ventricular stiffness but not glucose tolerance. However, ALA, EPA and DHA all reduced inflammation in both the heart and the liver, cardiac fibrosis and hepatic steatosis. These effects were associated with complete suppression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 activity. Since the physiological responses to EPA and DHA were similar, it is likely that the effects are mediated by DHA with EPA serving as a precursor. Also, ALA supplementation increased DHA concentrations but induced different physiological responses to EPA and DHA. This result strongly suggests that ALA has independent effects in , not relying on its metabolism to DHA.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship of the plasma FA profile and desaturase activities with the MetS in a Mediterranean population at high risk of CVD.Baseline data from 427 participants aged 55-80 years who took part in the interventional PREDIMED study were obtained. Individual FA was determined in plasma and desaturase activities were estimated from product/precursor ratios. Odds ratios (OR) and partial correlation coefficients were used to examine these relations with MetS and its components, respectively.We found higher levels of C14:0, C16:0, C16:1n-7, estimated Δ(9)- or stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), and estimated Δ(6) desaturase (D6D), and lower levels of C18:2n-6 in people with MetS compared to those without it. After adjustment for several confounders, only higher quartiles of C14:0, C16:0, C16:1n-7, and D6D were found to be associated with an increasing prevalence of MetS, while higher quartiles of C18:2n-6 were inversely associated with MetS. High proportions of C14:0, C16:0, C16:1n-7, C20:3n-6, SCD, and D6D, and decreased proportions of C18:2n-6 and estimated Δ(5)-desaturase (D5D) were associated with adverse profiles of several  risk factors. Women showed more unhealthy FA pattern and lipid profiles than men, but only among those with MetS.A FA composition and estimated desaturase activities consisting in high levels of SFA, SCD and D6D, and low levels of PUFA and D5D are associated with increased MetS probability and are characteristic of people presenting MetS, especially women.

The adrenal cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, CYP17 and CYP21, are essential for glucocorticoid synthesis. The omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may ameliorate , but it is unknown whether they have direct actions on adrenal CYP steroidogenic enzymes. The aim of this study was to determine whether PUFA modify adrenal glucocorticoid synthesis using isolated porcine microsomes. The enzyme activities of CYP17, CYP21, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH), and CYP2E1 were measured in intact microsomes treated with fatty acids of disparate saturated bonds. Cortisol production was measured in a cell-free in vitro model. Microsomal lipid composition after arachidonic  (AA) exposure was determined by sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra-mass spectrometry. Results showed that adrenal microsomal CYP21 activity was decreased by docosapentaenoic  (DPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), eicosapentaenoic , α-, AA, and linoleic , and CYP17 activity was inhibited by DPA, DHA, eicosapentaenoic , and AA. Inhibition was associated with the number of the PUFA double bonds. Similarly, cortisol production in vitro was decreased by DPA, DHA, and AA. Endoplasmic enzymes with intraluminal activity were unaffected by PUFA. In microsomes exposed to AA, the level of AA or oxidative metabolites of AA in the membrane was not altered. In conclusion, these observations suggest that omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA, especially those with 2 or more double bonds (DPA, DHA, and AA), impede adrenal glucocorticoid production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24334113>Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) from genesis to senescence: the influence of LCPUFA on neural development, aging, and neurodegeneration.</a></h2><p>Many clinical and animal studies demonstrate the importance of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) in neural development and neurodegeneration. This review will focus on involvement of LCPUFA from genesis to senescence. The LCPUFA docosahexaenoic  and arachidonic  are important components of neuronal membranes, while eicosapentaenoic , docosahexaenoic , and arachidonic  also affect cardiovascular health and inflammation. In neural development, LCPUFA deficiency can lead to severe disorders like schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Perinatal LCPUFA supplementation demonstrated beneficial effects in neural development in humans and rodents resulting in improved cognition and sensorimotor integration. In normal aging, the effect of LCPUFA on prevention of cognitive impairment will be discussed. LCPUFA are important for neuronal membrane integrity and function, and also contribute in prevention of brain hypoperfusion. Cerebral perfusion can be compromised as result of obesity, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus type 2. Last, we will focus on the role of LCPUFA in most common neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. These disorders are characterized by impaired cognition and connectivity and both clinical and animal supplementation studies have shown the potential of LCPUFA to decrease neurodegeneration and inflammation.

Visceral adiposity is part of the , together with insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension and inflammation. Alleviation of  requires normalization of insulin release and responses. This review assesses our current knowledge of the mechanisms that allow n-3 PUFAs to improve insulin secretion and sensitivity. EPA has been more extensively studied than either ALA or DHA. The complex actions of EPA include increased G-protein-receptor-mediated release of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) from enteroendocrine L-cells in the intestine, up-regulation of the apelin pathway and down-regulation of other control pathways to promote insulin secretion by the pancreatic β-cells, together with suppression of inflammatory responses to adipokines, inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α actions and prevention of decreased insulin-like growth factor-1 secretion to improve peripheral insulin responses. The receptors involved and the mechanisms of action probably differ for ALA and DHA, with antiobesity effects predominating for ALA and anti-inflammatory effects for DHA. Modifying both GLP-1 release and the actions of adipokines by n-3 PUFAs could lead to additive improvements in both insulin secretion and sensitivity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Inflammation associated with IR is an interesting area of biomedical research in recent years and is expected to affect insulin signalling pathway via downregulating glucose transporters. In the present study, we evaluate the potential of punicic  (PA), a nutraceutical found in pomegranate seed oil, against TNF-α induced alteration in 3T3-L1 adipocytes on glucose metabolism, endocrine function and inflammation. IR was induced in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by treating with TNF-α (10 ng/mL) and various concentrations of PA (5, 10, 30 μM) were incubated simultaneously. After 24 h, we found that TNF-α treatment increased mRNA expression of SOCS3, PTP1B and a decrease in IRS1 causing diminished glucose uptake. Further, it showed significantly increased transcriptional activity of NFκB and leptin secretion while PA maintained leptin levels normal. Additionally, PA prevented the over-expression of phosphorylated JNK in a dose dependent manner during IR. PA also ameliorated significantly the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. From the results, we conclude that PA is effective to ameliorate TNF-α induced IR and also we recommend the intake of PA for control and management of IR and its associated complications.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

After a 6-month dietary intervention, there were significant decreases in the serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), TNF-α, IL-6, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble endothelial selectin (sE-selectin) and asymmetric dimethylarginine in both dietary groups. However, no inter-group differences were observed for all these changes.

In (n-3) LCPUFA-supplemented rats, liver triglycerides and the peritoneal macrophage response to an inflammatory stimulus were significantly lower than in rats fed the control diet, and heart triglycerides were lower, but only in KO-fed rats. These effects were associated with a lower concentration of the endocannabinoids, anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, in the visceral adipose tissue and of anandamide in the liver and heart, which, in turn, was associated with lower levels of arachidonic  in membrane phospholipids, but not with higher activity of endocannabinoid-degrading enzymes. Our data suggest that the beneficial effects of a diet enriched with (n-3) LCPUFA are the result of changes in membrane fatty  composition.

The plant form of Omega-3 FAs is the short-chain α-, and the marine forms are the long-chain fatty acids: docosahexaenoic  and eicosapentaenoic . Omega-3 FAs have unlimited usages, and they are considered as omnipotent since they may benefit heart health, improve brain function, reduce cancer risks and improve people's moods. Omega-3 FAs also have several important biological effects on a range of cellular functions that may decrease the onset of heart diseases and reduce mortality among patients with coronary heart disease, possibly by stabilizing the heart's rhythm and by reducing blood clotting. Some review studies have described the beneficial roles of Omega-3 FAs in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancer, diabetes, and other conditions, including inflammation. Studies of the effect of Omega-3 FAs gathered from studies in diseased and healthy population. CVDs including atherosclerosis, coronary heart diseases, hypertension, and  were the major fields of investigation. In studies of obesity, as the central obesity increased, the level of adipocyte synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were increased and the level of anti-inflammatory adiponectin was decreased indicating a state of inflammation. The level of C reactive protein (CRP) synthesized from hepatocyte is increased by the influence of IL-6. CRP can be considered as a marker of systemic inflammation associated with increased risks of CVDs.

Patients with steatosis had a higher BMI (p = 0.0005), and higher plasma triglyceride levels (p = 0.009) than did patients without steatosis. We report a significant association between palmitic  (16:0), palmitoleic  (16:1n-7) concentrations and ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fatty  (palmitoleic  to palmitic ) and higher liver fat content. Total polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), homo-gamma- (20:3n-6), docosahexaenoic  (22:6n-3), and arachidonic  (20:4 n-6) were associated with lower LFC.Our data showed that an increased erythrocytes long-chain n-3 and n-6 fatty acids was associated with a lower prevalence of steatosis in patients with type 2 diabetes. These results suggest that n-3 and n-6 fatty acids supplementation could be a promising treatment for NAFLD in patients with type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Fatty acids were assessed in both oils while curcuminoids were determined in turmeric. Rats were divided into; first group fed on balanced diet and designated as normal control (NC), second fed on dyslipidemic and steatohepatitis (DS) inducer diet which represented the DS control group and groups 3-6 fed on DS inducer diet with daily oral administration of B, B+T+TC, F and F+T+TC; respectively for 5 weeks. Liver fat and plasma lipid profile, oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarker and liver and heart histopathology were assessed. Results showed gamma  to be 21.01% in B. F contained eicosapentaenoic as 22.768% and docosahexaenoic  as 13.574%.Total curcuminoids were 4.63 mg/g turmeric. The DS control group showed significant dyslipidemia, elevated malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-alpha and liver fat with significant reduction in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) compared to NC. The different treatments produced significant improvement in all the parameters and histopathology. F was superior to B in ameliorating liver histopathological changes while B was more efficient in elevating TAC. B was more promising in improving lipid profile and liver fat compared to B + T + TC, while the latter was superior in improving MDA and liver histopathology. Fish oil was more efficient than F+TC+T except for TAC and high density lipoprotein cholesterol which were more improved on addition of TC and T. Conclusion: Borage and fish oil with or without antioxidants protect from cardiovascular and fatty liver diseases with variable degrees.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27178023>NO synthesis from arginine is favored by α- in mice fed a high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>Alterations in NO availability and signaling play a pivotal role at early stages of the  (MetSynd). We hypothesized that dietary α- (ALA, 18:3 n-3) favors NO availability by modulating amino  metabolism, with a specific impact on the arginine-NO pathway. Mice were fed a hyperlipidic diet (285 g lipid/kg, 51.1 % energy), rich in either saturated fatty acids (SFA, provided by palm oil, PALM group) or ALA (provided by linseed oil, LIN group). We measured whole-body NO synthesis and systemic arginine hydrolysis with a tracer-based method, plasma concentration of related metabolites, and hepatic mRNA level of related enzymes, and the study was completed by a transcriptomic analysis in the liver. As expected with this model, hyperlipidic diets resulted in increased adiposity and glycemia after 5 weeks. As compared to PALM mice, LIN mice had a higher plasma nitrite and nitrate concentration, a higher whole-body conversion of arginine into NO vs urea, and a similar plasma concentration of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), despite a higher expression of the liver dimethylargininase-1. In LIN mice, there was a higher expression of genes involved in PPARα signaling, but a little impact on gene expression related to amino acids and arginine metabolism. This effect cannot be directly ascribed to changes in arginase activity in the liver or ADMA metabolism, nor to direct regulation of the related target genes. In conclusion, dietary ALA favors NO synthesis, which could contribute to rescue NO availability when jeopardized by the nutritional conditions in relation with the initiation of the MetSynd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21062475>A defect in Δ6 and Δ5 desaturases may be a factor in the initiation and progression of insulin resistance, the  and ischemic heart disease in South Asians.</a></h2><p>The high incidence of insulin resistance and the  in South Asians remains unexplained. I propose that a defect in the activity of Δ⁶ and Δ⁵ desaturases and consequent low plasma and tissue concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as γ- (GLA), dihomo-γ- (DGLA), arachidonic  (AA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and formation of their anti-inflammatory products prostaglandin E₁ (PGE₁), prostacyclin (PGI₂), PGI₃, lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, maresins and nitrolipids could be responsible for the high incidence of insulin resistance, the  and ischemic heart disease (IHD) in South Asians. This proposal is supported by the observation that South Asian Indians have lower plasma and tissue concentrations of GLA, DGLA, AA, EPA and DHA, the precursors of PGE₁, PGI₂, PGI₃, lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and nitrolipids, the endogenous molecules that prevent platelet aggregation, vasoconstriction, thrombus formation, leukocyte activation and possess anti-inflammatory action and thus, are capable of preventing the development of insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and premature ischemic heart disease. Genetic predisposition, high carbohydrate intake, lack of exercise, tobacco use and low birth weight due to maternal malnutrition suppress the activity of Δ⁶ and Δ⁵ desaturases that leads to low plasma and tissue concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids and their products. This implies that adequate provision of polyunsaturated fatty acids and co-factors needed for their metabolism, and efforts to enhance the formation of their beneficial metabolites PGE₁, PGI₂, PGI₃, lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, maresins and nitrolipids could form a novel approach in the prevention and management of these diseases in this high-risk population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20228612>Polyunsaturated fatty  levels of serum and red blood cells in apparently healthy Japanese subjects living in an urban area.</a></h2><p>We assessed levels of polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) in serum and red blood cells (RBCs) among groups stratified by generation and its clinical significance in Japanese subjects living in an urban area.We enrolled 200 apparently healthy Japanese (126 males, mean age: 50.3+/-9.2 years) living in an urban area. Levels of PUFA, including eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), arachidonic  (AA), and dihomo-gamma- (DGLA) in serum and RBCs were measured for each generation (G1 <35y, G2 35y-<45y, G3 45y-<55y, G4 55y-<65y, G5>or=65y).No significant differences in EPA, DHA, AA, or EPA/AA were observed between males and females. After dividing into generations, stepwise increases in EPA and DHA, but not DGLA or AA, were observed in serum (all p<0.0001). EPA/AA ratios were stepwisely increased in serum (mean: G1:0.26, G2:0.29, G3:0.43, G4:0.58, G5:0.68, p<0.0001) and RBCs (mean: G1:0.10, G2:0.09, G3:0.15, G4:0.20, G5:0.23, p<0.0001). Positive correlations of EPA (r=0.83), DHA (r=0.55), DGLA (r=0.54), AA (r=0.29), and EPA/AA (r=0.91) were demonstrated between serum and RBCs.

The analysis included only those with 2 or more components of MetS before receiving either lifestyle counseling (LC, n = 90) or LC + 30 g/day flaxseed supplementation (LCF, n = 83).Compared to the LC group, those in the LCF group experienced significant increases in total erythrocyte n-3 PUFAs, α-, eicosapentenoic , and docosapentenoic  (all P < 0.001), while total n-6 PUFAs (P < 0.05) and n-6/n-3 ratio decreased (P < 0.001). Arachidonic  increased significantly in the LC group (P < 0.001), and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-18, soluble intracellular adhesion molecular-1, E-selectin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 declined significantly in both groups (all P < 0.05), but no between-group differences were observed. There was no significant change in serum interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, soluble vascular adhesion molecular-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and oxidized low-density lipoprotein in either group.These data suggest that flaxseed supplementation increases erythrocyte n-3 PUFAs, decreases n-6 PUFAs and n-6/n-3 ratio in participants with risk factors of MetS, but has no additional benefits beyond the lifestyle consulting for the multiple biomarkers tested in the current study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18806101>Long-chain (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids prevent  and vascular disorders in fructose-fed rats.</a></h2><p>The crossover relationship between cardiometabolic risk, in terms of insulin resistance and vascular dysfunction, and the fatty  (FA) profile of insulin-sensitive tissues as well as the dietary FA impact has almost never been explored in the same experiment. In this study, the intake of  (ALA) alone and/or with its higher metabolites, eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) were evaluated in a nonobese, hypertriglyceridemic and insulin-resistant rat model, that exhibits the 2 main characteristics of . Wistar rats were fed either a cornstarch and (n-6) PUFA-based diet (C-N6) or a 66% fructose diet over a 10-wk period. Fructose-fed rats received a diet containing ALA alone (F-ALA group) or ALA plus EPA and DHA (F-LC3 group) or no (n-3) PUFA (F-N6 group). The 10-wk high-fructose diet (F-N6) induced an insulin-resistant state, as assessed by glucose and insulin tolerance tests. Insulin resistance was linked to a specific FA pattern in insulin-sensitive tissues, which probably involved modifications of Delta9, Delta6, and Delta5-desaturases. This pathological status was related to high cardiovascular risk as assessed by increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures and particularly by the increase of pulse pressure, an index of vascular stiffness obtained from telemetry investigations. The (n-3) experimental diets prevented changes in the FA patterns in insulin-sensitive tissues, insulin resistance, and vascular dysfunction. This beneficial effect was large with an intake of long chain (n-3) PUFA (ALA+EPA+DHA) and to a lesser extent with dietary ALA alone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11742889>Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and relations to fatty  composition in the diet and in serum cholesterol esters.</a></h2><p>High plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 levels and poor dietary fat quality are potential risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The aim was to investigate the cross-sectional associations between PAI-1 activity and dietary nutrient intake, focusing on fat quality, in a population-based study of 871 men aged 70 years. The relationship between PAI-1 and the fatty  composition in serum cholesterol esters (n=381 men) was also studied. The estimated total fat intake was positively associated with PAI-1 activity. The intake of both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids was positively associated with PAI-1 activity, whereas the intake of saturated fatty acids was not. In serum cholesterol esters, higher proportions of palmitoleic and dihomo-gamma-, a lower proportion of linoleic , and reduced estimated Delta5-desaturase activity were associated with higher PAI-1 levels. These associations were confounded by factors representing the insulin resistance . PAI-1 activity was positively associated with gamma- and arachidonic , independent of potential confounders. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that dietary intake of unsaturated fatty acids is positively associated with PAI-1 activity, whereas intake of saturated fatty acids is not. The associations present between PAI-1 activity and the fatty  proportions in serum cholesterol esters are partly influenced by -related factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16484595>Dietary factors that promote or retard inflammation.</a></h2><p>Inflammation plays a pivotal role in all stages of atherosclerosis.

Most of the studies with fish oil supplementation have shown null effects, and conflicting results have been reported with saturated and trans fatty acids, cholesterol, and soy intake.

The biosynthesis of saturated fatty acids (SFA) in mammals provides substrates for β-oxidation and ATP production. Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) are products of desaturases that introduce a methylene group in cis geometry in SFA. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 and n-3 PUFA) are products of elongation and desaturation of the essential linoleic  and α-, respectively. The liver processes dietary fatty acids and exports them in lipoproteins for distribution and storage in peripheral tissues. The three types of fatty acids are integrated in membrane phospholipids and determine their biophysical properties and functions. This study was aimed at investigating effects of fatty acids on membrane biophysical properties under varying nutritional and pathological conditions, by integrating lipidomic analysis of membrane phospholipids with functional two-photon microscopy (fTPM) of cellular membranes. This approach was applied to two case studies: first, pancreatic beta-cells, to investigate hormetic and detrimental effects of lipids.

The aim of the study was to examine the associations of adipose tissue PUFA biomarkers with MetS among parents and children in Mesoamerica.We conducted a cross-sectional study among 468 parents and 201 children aged 7-12 y from the capital cities of Guatemala, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Costa Rica, and Belize, and Tuxtla Gutiérrez in Mexico. We measured PUFA biomarkers in gluteal adipose tissue by gas chromatography. In adults, MetS was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III definition. In children, we created an age- and sex-standardized  risk score using abdominal circumference, the homeostasis model of insulin resistance, blood pressure, serum HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. We estimated prevalence ratios of MetS and mean differences in  score across quartiles of PUFA using multivariable-adjusted Poisson and linear regression models, respectively. Among adults, MetS was associated with low  (ALA), high eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and low gamma- (GLA). It was linearly, positively associated with dihomo-gamma- (DGLA) and estimated Δ6-desaturase (D6D) activity. Among children, the  score was positively associated with docosapentaenoic  (DPA), DGLA, and D6D activity.Among Mesoamerican adults, MetS prevalence is inversely associated with adipose tissue ALA and GLA, and positively associated with EPA, DGLA, and the D6D index. Among children,  risk score is positively associated with DPA, DGLA, and the D6D index.Copyright © 2018 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Blood sampled over 168 h and a liver specimen obtained 96 h after isotope administration were analyzed for d(5)-18:3n-3, d(5)-20:5n-3, d(5)-22:5n-3, and d(5)-22:6n-3. Plasma 20:5n-3 and 22:5n-3 were lower in AD subjects, compared with controls (20:5n-3: -50%, 22:5n-3: -34%). Increased amounts of d(5)-18:3n-3 were directed toward synthesis of d(5)-20:5n-3 in AD subjects (P < .05). However, this effect was offset by larger amounts of 20:5n-3 lost from plasma (control: 2.0 vs. AD: 4.2 mg d(-1)). In livers of AD subjects, more d(5)-18:3n-3 and d(5)-22:5n-3 were utilized for synthesis of d(5)-20:5n-3 (+200%) and d(5)-22:6n-3 (+210%), respectively, than was predicted from plasma kinetics. Although, the potential to utilize  for synthesis of LCP FA was greater in AD subjects compared with controls, heightened disappearance rates of 20:5n-3 reduced overall plasma concentrations of several endogenous n-3 LCP FA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21696790>Site dependency of fatty  composition in adipose triacylglycerol in rats and its absence as a result of high-fat feeding.</a></h2><p>It is currently believed that , in general, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, in particular, depend more on visceral than on subcutaneous adipose tissue. However, the relationship between insulin resistance and fatty  composition in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues remains to be clarified. In the present study, we extracted the triacylglycerol from visceral (epididymis and mesentery) and subcutaneous adipose tissues in normal and insulin-resistant, high-fat-fed (HFF) rats and determined the composition of each fatty . The concentrations of palmitoleic, docosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic, dihomo-γ-, arachidonic, and docosatetraenoic acids were higher in epididymal adipose tissue than in mesenteric and subcutaneous adipose tissues; but no significant differences were detected between mesenteric and subcutaneous tissues in the normal group or among all the sites in the HFF rats. In the HFF group, stearic and oleic  concentrations were higher, whereas n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated ones were lower, than those in the normal group. Palmitoleic  and some n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty  compositions in adipose tissue triacylglycerol depend on anatomical location, which may affect the properties and/or function of adipose tissues. These results at least in part suggest that the properties of adipose tissue are difficult to distinguish based only on their "visceral" or "subcutaneous" sites. In addition, the absence of site dependence and/or difference in balance among saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids may play an important role in the development of insulin resistance in the HFF rats.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Clinical characteristics, the fatty  composition of plasma cholesteryl esters, and energy and nutrient intakes were analyzed in 3 groups:  (MS, n=24), abdominal obesity (OB, n=43), and control (n=27). The estimated desaturase activities were calculated by the ratio of 16:1n-7/16:0, 18:3n-6/18:2n-6, and 20:4n-6/20:3n-6 in plasma cholesteryl esters as surrogates of the measure of the delta 9, delta 6, delta 5 desaturase (D9-16D, D6D and D5D) activities, respectively. Plasma fatty  composition did not differ significantly between the OB group and the control group. The MS group had higher levels of palmitoleic, oleic, and gamma- acids, but a lower level of linoleic  than the control. Stronger D6D activity and weaker D5D activity were observed in the OB group. A higher level of D9-16D activity as well as a higher level of D6D activity and a lower level of D5D activity was observed in the MS group.

PUFA n-3 include  (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), while PUFA n-6 include linoleic  (LA) and arachidonic  (AA). Since PUFA n-3 consumption has been shown to be inversely correlated with coronary heart diseases (CHD) incidence, clinical trials have been principally conducted by administering fish oil supplements or purified PUFA n-3. The relationship between dietary PUFA n-3 and CHD is believed to be only partially mediated by their effects on plasma lipoprotein profile. PUFA n-3 have shown to reduce only slightly total and LDL cholesterol, probably as they crowd saturated fatty acids out of diet. Data on HDL cholesterol suggest that PUFA n-3 produce only a small increase in this fraction. The effect of PUFA n-3 supplementation on plasma triglycerides (TG) is much more important, with a reduction of about 25% in normolipidemic subjects and about 50% in hypertriglyceridemic patients. This effect seems to be mediated by an inhibition of hormone-sensitive lipase, and VLDL secretion, and an increase in apo B liver degradation. They also increase lipoprotein lipase activity resulting in a reduction of post-prandial TG. PUFA n-3 might be used as second line therapy, additional or alternative to fibrates and nicotinic , in the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia. Furthermore, the addition of PUFA n-3 to statin therapy might contribute to normalize TG levels in patients with combined hyperlipidemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29373685>Phytosphingosine is a novel activator of GPR120.</a></h2><p>GPR120 is a receptor for long chain fatty acids and is expressed in small intestinal endocrine cells, L cells and adipose tissue. Activation of GPR120 promotes the secretion of incretin GLP-1, which is known to have effects on anti-. As such, GPR120 is a potential target of pharmaceuticals for type II diabetes. In this study, we performed ligand-screening for GPR120 on glycero- and sphingo-type lipids and their derivatives using a Transforming Growth Factor α-shedding assay. We found that phytosphingosine (PHS) activates GPR120 in a manner comparable to the natural ligand α- (ALA) and superior to that of the synthetic ligand GW9508. The IC50 value of PHS was 33.4 μM, of ALA was 31.0 μM and of GW9508 was 41.7 μM. Additionally, PHS-induced activation of GPR120 was inhibited by the specific antagonist AH7614. Many of the natural or synthetic ligands found thus far are compounds with carboxyl groups. However, PHS does not possess a carboxyl group, suggesting that its manner of interaction with GPR120 may be significantly different from that of other ligands. Since PHS is rich in the plasma membrane of yeast, our results imply that PHS found in fermented food could have effects on anti-diabetes through activation of GPR120.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22988791>[The individual fatty acids in blood plasma, erythrocytes and lipoproteins. The comparison of tests results of patients with ischemic heart disease and volunteers].</a></h2><p>According to the generally accepted theory, the atherosclerosis is a kind of disorder of metabolism of lipids which chemically are the ethers of fatty lipids with spirits. Hence, the atherosclerosis is fatty acids pathology. In conformity with the biologic classification, among fatty acids it is functionally valid to distinguish saturated fatty acids without double bonds; monoenic fatty acids with one double bond; unsaturated fatty acids with two or three double bonds and polyenic fatty acids with four of six double bonds in chain. The saturated and monenic fatty acids are the substrates for cells to groundwork energy, ATP The unsaturated fatty acids in vivo are needed to form membranes. The polyenic fatty acids are essential since they are precursors of cell synthesis of humoral regulators--eicosanoids (prostanoids and leukotrienes). To clarify the pathogenesis of the " pandemics" most prevalent in human population, the quantitative determination of individual fatty acids in blood plasma and erythrocytes using gas chromatography technique is needed. It is necessary to evaluate the content of medium chain fatty acids; palmitic and stearic saturated fatty acids; oleic monoenic fatty  and its transforms--linoleic,  and dihomo-gamma- unsaturated fatty acids; essential polyenic omega-6 arachidonic, omega-3 eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic fatty acids. The higher is in food the content of palmitic saturated fatty , palmitoleic and trans-vaccenic monoenic fatty acids, the more is in patient diet of beef meat and products of fat cow's milk. The higher is ratio of palmitic/oleic fatty acids the lower is the risk of formation of atheromatosis of arteries intima and development of ischemic heart disease and vice versa. The decrease of ratio of omega-3/omega-6 essential polyenic fatty acids is undesirable in prognostic sense. The metabolism of these acids differs and functional activity of omega-3 eicosanoid type 3 is higher In case of deficiency of omega-3 and omega-6 polyenic fatty acids in cells eicosanoids are synthesized from unsaturated dihomogamma- fatty  and their influence turns out to be aphysiologic. This condition is a pathogenic foundation of atherosclerosis.

Diet composition was adapted to previous dietary habits. Fatty  composition of erythrocyte membranes was analyzed by gas-chromatography using flame ionization detector.Following bed rest, the HOMA index of insulin resistance significantly increased by +51+/-11% (P<0.01).

Fractional content of arachidonic  increased by +14+/-12% (P=0.01) following inactivity. Delta5 and Delta9 desaturase indexes, as estimated from product-to-precursor ratios, significantly diminished following bed rest from 9.6+/-0.4 to 8.4+/-0.3 (P<0.001) and from 0.72+/-0.02 to 0.69+/-0.01 (P<0.05), respectively. The n-3 fatty acids,  and eicosapentaenoic, were decreased (P=0.05) following inactivity by 4.7+/-13.2% and 3.8+/-5.2%, respectively.Inactivity-mediated insulin resistance was associated with altered Delta5 and Delta9 desaturase indexes and with pro-inflammatory fatty  pattern in erythrocyte membranes.

Med diet induced higher postprandial SOD2 and TrxR mRNA levels, and CHO-PUFA diet induced higher GPx1 and TrxR mRNA levels compared with SFA-rich diet. Med and CHO-PUFA breakfasts induced a postprandial increase in plasma reduced glutathione (GSH), and a greater postprandial GSH/oxidized glutathione ratio compared to the SFA-rich diet. Our study suggests that the consumption of Med and CHO-PUFA diets may reduce postprandial oxidative stress compared to an SFA-rich diet, which may be due to higher antioxidant enzymes gene expression in adipose tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651160>Effects of 1-year intervention with a Mediterranean diet on plasma fatty  composition and  in a population at high cardiovascular risk.</a></h2><p> (MetS) has become an important public concern due to its increasing prevalence. An altered fatty  composition has been associated with MetS, but the Mediterranean diet has been shown to have a protective effect. The aim of the present study was to analyze the influence of a Mediterranean dietary pattern, as assessed by the biomarkers of food supplied, on the plasma fatty  composition and its relation with MetS after 1 year of intervention.A total of 424 subjects were randomly selected from the PREDIMED randomized dietary trial after completing a 1-year intervention program. Participants aged 55 to 80 years and at high risk of cardiovascular disease were randomly assigned to three dietary interventions: Mediterranean diet supplemented with virgin olive oil or nuts, or a low-fat diet.After 1 year of intervention participants in the virgin olive oil group showed significantly increased plasma concentrations of palmitic and oleic acids, but reduced proportions of margaric, stearic, and linoleic acids. In turn, subjects in the nut group showed significantly increased levels of palmitic, linoleic, and α- acids, but reduced proportions of myristic, margaric, palmitoleic, and dihommo-γ-linoleic acids. Increases in the biomarkers of foods supplied to the Mediterranean diet groups, i.e., oleic and α- acids, were beneficially associated with the incidence, reversion and prevalence of MetS. No weight changes were observed among participants.The nut and olive oil diets induced a fatty  composition that has been shown to be beneficial in the face of MetS. Therefore, a Mediterranean diet rich in fats of vegetable origin may be a useful tool for the management of MetS without the need for concerns over weight gain due to its high fat content.Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN35739639.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28821830>Disease- combination modeling: metabolomic strategy for the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease.</a></h2><p>Conventional disease animal models have limitations on the conformity to the actual clinical situation. Disease- combination (DS) modeling may provide a more efficient strategy for biomedicine research. Disease model and DS model of renal fibrosis in chronic kidney disease were established by ligating the left ureter and by ligating unilateral ureteral combined with exhaustive swimming, respectively. Serum metabolomics was conducted to evaluate disease model and DS model by using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Potential endogenous biomarkers were identified by multivariate statistical analysis. There are no differences between two models regarding their clinical biochemistry and kidney histopathology, while metabolomics highlights their difference. It is found that abnormal sphingolipid metabolism is a common characteristic of both models, while arachidonic  metabolism,  metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism are highlighted in DS model. Metabolomics is a promising approach to evaluate experiment animal models. DS model are comparatively in more coincidence with clinical settings, and is superior to single disease model for the biomedicine research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10869902>Effects of protein-energy malnutrition and human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection on essential fatty  metabolism in children.</a></h2><p>This report summarizes data on the availability of essential fatty acids (EFAs) and their long-chain polyunsaturated fatty  (LCPUFA) metabolites in protein-energy malnutrition (PEM), in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection for which less information is available, and the combination of both PEM and HIV-1. The contribution of different EFAs and LCPUFAs to the fatty- composition of plasma and erythrocyte membrane lipids was found to be reduced in children with PEM in comparison with well-nourished children. In addition to limited dietary EFA supply, reduced bioconversion of EFAs to their respective LCPUFA metabolites and/or peroxidative degradation of LCPUFAs may contribute to the reduction of LCPUFA status in malnourished children. Restoration of normal energy, protein, and EFA intakes does not appear to readily correct abnormalities of plasma and erythrocyte membrane LCPUFA values. Enhanced dietary supply of LCPUFAs and/or improved supply of antioxidant vitamins may represent novel therapeutic modalities in severe PEM. With and without PEM, HIV infection was related to altered availability of various EFAs and LCPUFAs in HIV-seropositive children. The plasma total lipid fatty- profiles seen in well-nourished children with HIV infection were compatible with an HIV infection-related enhancement of the  activity of the conversion of EFAs to their respective LCPUFA metabolites. However, the plasma phospholipid EFA and LCPUFA profiles seen in severely malnourished children with HIV infection more closely resembled those seen in children with PEM but without HIV infection than in those in children with HIV infection but no PEM.  studies using stable isotope-labeled fatty acids may contribute to better understanding of the HIV-related changes in EFA metabolism and clearly are needed before therapeutic conclusions can be drawn.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19069444>[The composition of nonesterified fatty acids in patients with ].</a></h2><p>The blood composition of non-etherized fatty acids (NEFA) was studied in 22 patients with  (MS) and 11 healthy individuals. The qualitative NEFA composition presented by 31 components of individual fatty acids was analyzed, by taking into account of glucose-insulin homeostatic changes in MS patients: those without insulin resistance (IR) (Group 1) and those with diagnosed IR (Group 2). MS patients with normal insulinemia were ascertained to have lower levels of lauric, myristic, palmitic, C24:0, C16:0i acids. With a decrease in the relative quantity of saturated NEFA, the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (FA) increased. The proportions of linoleic (C18:2 omega 6) and  (C18:3 omega 3) acids doubled (p < 0.01), arachidonic  (C20:4 omega 6) was observed to tend to rise. The cumulative FA index sigma omega 6 increased twofold. In Group 1, the integrated index of changes in the FA series (unsaturation index) was 41% higher than that in the control group (p < 0.05). In Group 2, the vector of changes in the relative quantity of NEFA was similar, but impairments were less marked than that in Group 1.

To examine this hypothesis, serum phospholipid FA, desaturase activities, fasting glycemic status, and cardiometabolic parameters were measured in study participants (n = 1022; 30-69 years; male, n = 527; female, n = 495; nondiabetics without disease) who were stratified into normal fasting glucose (NFG) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) groups. Total monounsaturated FA (MUFA), oleic  (OA; 18:1n-9), dihomo-γ- (DGLA; 20:3n-6), Δ-9-desaturase activity (D9D; 18:1n-9/18:0), and DGLA/linoleic  (20:3n-6/18:2n-6) in serum phospholipids were significantly higher in IFG subjects than NFG controls. Study subjects were subdivided into 4 groups, based on fasting glucose levels and MetS status. Palmitoleic  (16:1n-7) was highest in IFG-MetS and lowest in NFG-non-MetS subjects. Oleic  and D9D were higher in IFG-MetS than in the other 3 groups. Dihomo-γ- and DGLA/linoleic  were higher in MetS than in non-MetS, regardless of fasting glucose levels. The high-sensitivity C-reactive proteins (hs-CRPs) and 8-epi-prostaglandin-F2α were higher in IFG than in NFG, regardless of MetS status. Oxidized low-density lipoproteins were higher in IFG-MetS than in the other 3 groups. Total MUFAs, OA, and D9D were positively correlated with homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, fasting glucose, triglyceride, hs-CRP, and 8-epi-prostaglandin-F2α. Palmitoleic  was positively correlated with triglyceride and hs-CRP. Lastly, total MUFA, OA, palmitoleic , and D9D were associated with early alteration of fasting glycemic status, therefore suggesting that these may be useful markers for predicting the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiometabolic diseases.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Dyslipidemia and steatohepatitis are diseases that require effective treatments in obese and non-obese patients. The aim was to evaluate the effect of chia intake on acute tyloxapol (TI)-induced dyslipidemia, on acute carbon tetrachloride (TC)-induced steatohepatitis, and on mixed damage (TC+TI) in non-obese rats. Four experimental groups were fed for 4 weeks a diet with established rodent food (DE), and four groups were fed a diet with 15% added chia (DC). Plasma samples were analyzed for total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, biochemical liver damage markers, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Liver samples were used to quantify glycogen, catalase, lipid peroxidation, and TNF-α. A histopathological analysis was performed. DC intake partially or totally prevented steatohepatitis, and reduced lipids in the dyslipidemic groups. The hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective effects of chia may be correlated to its high content of α- (omega-3) and phenolics. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS:  is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which are currently the most common causes of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. Dyslipidemia is a significant risk factor for NAFLD and NASH. Non-obese patients may have NAFLD or NASH.  and dyslipidemia are more strongly associated with NAFLD in non-obese than in obese patients. This is the first study evaluating the hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective effects of chia seed intake on acute dyslipidemia and/or steatohepatitis caused by the individual or combined administration of the inducers tyloxapol and carbon tetrachloride, respectively, in non-obese rats. The pharmacological effects of dietary chia are correlated to its high content of omega-3 and omega-6 (1:1), protein, dietary fiber, and phenolics. The results suggest that inclusion of chia in diets of non-obese patients with dyslipidemia and/or NAFLD/NASH may improve their health state and preventing cirrhosis or HCC.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29031387> pathways of oleic and palmitic  are intensified in PCOS patients with normal androgen levels.</a></h2><p>The aetiology and pathogenesis polycystic ovary  (PCOS) remain uncertain and thus the relative studies are still crucial.Our aim was to analyse the fatty acids profiles of the main phospholipids species in serum from women with PCOS classified into phenotypes, and to diagnose women more susceptible to the occurrence of inflammatory state.PCOS screening tests were performed in The Clinic of Gynecology and Urogynecology of Pomeranian Medical University in the 2014-2015 years.The study are designed for general community and a primary care or referral center.39 patients with PCOS, diagnosed according to Rotterdam's criteria, and 14 healthy women, as a control group, participated in this study.

However, some data suggest heterogeneity within the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) depot with potential  differences between the superficial SAT (sSAT) and deep SAT (dSAT) compartments. We aimed to investigate the heterogeneity of these three depots with regard to fatty  (FA) composition and gene expression. Adipose tissue biopsies were collected from 75 obese women undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery. FA composition and gene expression were determined with gas chromatography and quantitative real-time-PCR, respectively. Stearoyl CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) activity was estimated by product-to-precursor FA ratios. All polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) with 20 carbons were consistently lower in VAT than either SAT depots, whereas essential PUFA (linoleic , 18:2n-6 and α-, 18:3n-3) were similar between all three depots. Lauric and palmitic  were higher and lower in VAT, respectively. The SCD-1 product palmitoleic  as well as estimated SCD-1 activity was higher in VAT than SAT. Overall, there was a distinct association pattern between lipid metabolizing genes and individual FAs in VAT. In conclusion, SAT and VAT are two distinct depots with regard to FA composition and expression of key lipogenic genes. However, the small differences between sSAT and dSAT suggest that FA metabolism of SAT is rather homogenous.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21733300>Differences in arachidonic  levels and fatty  desaturase (FADS) gene variants in African Americans and European Americans with diabetes or the .</a></h2><p>Over the past 50 years, increases in dietary n-6 PUFA, such as linoleic , have been hypothesised to cause or exacerbate chronic inflammatory diseases.

Compared with European Americans (EAm), African Americans (AfAm) exhibited markedly higher serum levels of arachidonic  (AA) (EAm 7·9 (sd 2·1), AfAm 9·8 (sd 1·9) % of total fatty acids; P < 2·29 × 10⁻⁹) and the AA:n-6-precursor fatty  ratio, which estimates FADS1 activity (EAm 5·4 (sd 2·2), AfAm 6·9 (sd 2·2); P = 1·44 × 10⁻⁵). In all, seven SNP mapping to the FADS locus revealed strong association with AA, EPA and dihomo-γ- (DGLA) in the EAm. Importantly, EAm homozygous for the minor allele (T) had significantly lower AA levels (TT 6·3 (sd 1·0); GG 8·5 (sd 2·1); P = 3·0 × 10⁻⁵) and AA:DGLA ratios (TT 3·4 (sd 0·8), GG 6·5 (sd 2·3); P = 2·2 × 10⁻⁷) but higher DGLA levels (TT 1·9 (sd 0·4), GG 1·4 (sd 0·4); P = 3·3 × 10⁻⁷) compared with those homozygous for the major allele (GG). Allele frequency patterns suggest that the GG genotype at rs174537 (associated with higher circulating levels of AA) is much higher in AfAm (0·81) compared with EAm (0·46). Similarly, marked differences in rs174537 genotypic frequencies were observed in HapMap populations. These data suggest that there are probably important differences in the capacity of different populations to synthesise LC-PUFA.

The hypothesis that n-3 PUFA, which modulate protein homoeostasis via effects on insulin sensitivity, could contribute to maintain muscle mass during energy restriction was tested in rats fed a high-fat diet (4 weeks) rich in 18 : 1 n-9 (oleic , OLE-R), 18 : 3 n-3 (α-, ALA-R) or n-3 long-chain (LC-R) fatty  and then energy restricted (8 weeks). A control group (OLE-ad libitum (AL)) was maintained with AL diet throughout the study. Rats were killed 10 min after an i.v. insulin injection. All energy-restricted rats lost weight and fat mass, but only the OLE-R group showed a significant muscle loss. The Gastrocnemius muscle was enriched with ALA in the ALA-R group and with LC-PUFA in the ALA-R and LC-R groups. The proteolytic ubiquitin-proteasome system was differentially affected by energy restriction, with MAFbx and muscle ring finger-1 mRNA levels being decreased in the LC-R group (-30 and -20 %, respectively).

The onset time of convulsion following cerebral hemorrhage was recorded, and the areas of hemorrhage and infarction were analyzed in the stroke brains.In comparison with 58-day survival of SHR-SP rats during feeding NaCl alone, perilla oil extended the survival time to 68.5 days, whereas canola oil shortened it to 45.7 days. Feeding perilla oil greatly reduced the total volume of cerebral hemorrhage from 17.27% in the control group to 4.53%, while shortening increased the lesions to 21.23%. In a microscopic analysis, perilla oil also markedly decreased the hemorrhagic and infarction lesions to 1/10 of those in control rats, in contrast to an exacerbating effect of shortening. In blood analyses, perilla oil reduced blood total cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins which were increased in SHR-SP, but canola oil further increased them and markedly lowered platelet counts.Perilla oil delayed and attenuated cerebral hemorrhage by improving hyperlipidemia in hypertensive stroke animals, in contrast to the aggravating potential of canola oil and shortening.

This has, together with other man-made changes in our environment, caused a conflict with our slowly adapting genome that is implicated in “typically Western” diseases. Rather than reducing our life expectancy, these diseases notably diminish our number of years in health. Important changes in dietary fat quality are the increased intakes of certain saturated fatty acids (SAFA) and linoleic  (LA), introduction of industrially produced  fatty acids, and reduced intakes of ω3 fatty acids, notably  (ALA) from vegetable sources and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) from fish. The pathophysiological effects of these changes are diverse, but are increasingly ascribed to induction of a proinflammatory state that progresses easily to chronic low-grade inflammation. The latter might affect virtually all organs and systems, possibly beginning at conception, and possibly even prior to gametogenesis through epigenetic alterations. Low-grade inflammation might be a common denominator of the  and its sequelae (e.g., coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2, some types of cancer, and pregnancy complications), some psychiatric diseases (e.g., major and postpartum depression, schizophrenia, and autism), and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease). The long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) arachidonic  (AA), EPA, and DHA are intimately related to the initiation and resolution of inflammatory responses. The current balance between AA and EPA + DHA is however disturbed by the dominance of AA, which originates from the diet or synthesis from LA. LCPUFA are together with their highly potent metabolites (prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, resolvins, and (neuro)protectins) involved in the functioning of membrane-bound receptors, transporters, ion channels, and enzymes, and also in signal transduction and gene expression. Among their many targets are nuclear receptors which, upon ligation with LCPUFA and their metabolites, function as transcription factors of a variety of genes functioning in many pathways. For instance, the targeted peroxisome proliferators-activated receptors (PPARs) are strategic intermediates in the coordinated expression of proteins with functions in, for example, lipid and glucose homeostasis and inflammatory reactions. Many interventions have been conducted with LCPUFA, especially EPA and DHA, aiming at primary and secondary CAD preventions, improvement of fetal and newborn (brain) development by supplementation during pregnancy or early postnatal life, and in psychiatric diseases. Consensus has been reached that those in CAD and depression are positive, although more large-scale trials are needed. Many recommendations for the intakes of saturated fat,  fat and EPA + DHA have been issued, notably for CAD prevention, and also for EPA + DHA intakes by pregnant women and for AA, EPA, and DHA intakes by newborns. The ultimate goal might, however, be to return to the fat quality of our ancient diet on which our genes have evolved during the past million years of evolution, while this actually applies for our entire dietary composition and lifestyle, as translated to the culture of the current society.Copyright © 2010, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/619975>The nutritional and  impact of gamma- (18:3omega6) on cats deprived of animal lipid.</a></h2><p>1.

Although most studies have focussed on the predominant omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oils (eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic ), recent evidence suggests similar health benefits from their common precursor, stearidonic . Stearidonic  is a Delta6-unsaturated C18 omega-3 fatty  present in a few plant species (mainly the Boraginaceae and Primulaceae) reflecting the general absence of Delta6-desaturation from higher plants. Using a Delta6-desaturase from Primula vialii, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis and linseed lines accumulating stearidonic  in their seed lipids. Significantly, the P. vialiiDelta6-desaturase specifically only utilises  as a substrate, resulting in the accumulation of stearidonic  but not omega-6 gamma-. Detailed lipid analysis revealed the accumulation of stearidonic  in neutral lipids such as triacylglycerol but an absence from the acyl-CoA pool. In the case of linseed, the achieved levels of stearidonic  (13.4% of triacylglycerols) are very similar to those found in the sole natural commercial plant source (Echium spp.) or transgenic soybean oil. However, both those latter oils contain gamma-, which is not normally present in fish oils and considered undesirable for heart-healthy applications. By contrast, the stearidonic -enriched linseed oil is essentially devoid of this fatty . Moreover, the overall omega-3/omega-6 ratio for this modified linseed oil is also significantly higher. Thus, this nutritionally enhanced linseed oil may have superior health-beneficial properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22894911>Effects of a rapeseed oil-enriched hypoenergetic diet with a high content of α- on body weight and cardiovascular risk profile in patients with the .</a></h2><p>In therapy of the , the optimal dietary approach with regard to its macronutrient composition and metabolically favourable food components, such as the plant-derived n-3 fatty  α- (ALA), is still a matter of debate. We investigated the effects of a hypoenergetic diet with low energy density (ED) enriched in rapeseed oil, resulting in high MUFA content and an ALA intake of 3.5 g/d on body weight and cardiovascular risk profile in eighty-one patients with the  in comparison with an olive oil diet rich in MUFA, but with a low ALA content. After a 6-month dietary intervention, body weight was significantly reduced in the rapeseed oil and olive oil groups ( -7.8 v. -6.0 kg; P < 0.05). There were significant decreases in systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, and insulin levels in both groups (P < 0.05). For all of these changes, no inter-group differences were observed. After the rapeseed oil diet, diastolic blood pressure declined more than after the olive oil diet (P < 0.05 for time × group interaction). Furthermore, concentrations of serum TAG were significantly reduced after the high ALA intake, but not in the low ALA group (P < 0.05 for time × group interaction). In conclusion, our dietary food pattern with a low ED and high intakes of MUFA and ALA may be a practical approach for long-term dietary treatment in patients with the , leading to weight reduction and an improvement in the overall cardiovascular risk profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21063737>A role for PPARα in the regulation of arginine metabolism and nitric oxide synthesis.</a></h2><p>The pleiotropic effects of PPARα may include the regulation of amino  metabolism. Nitric oxide (NO) is a key player in vascular homeostasis. NO synthesis may be jeopardized by a differential channeling of arginine toward urea (via arginase) versus NO (via NO synthase, NOS). This was studied in wild-type (WT) and PPARα-null (KO) mice fed diets containing either saturated fatty acids (COCO diet) or 18:3 n-3 (LIN diet).  markers of arginine metabolism were assayed in urine and plasma. mRNA levels of arginases and NOS were determined in liver. Whole-body NO synthesis and the conversion of systemic arginine into urea were assessed by using (15)N(2)-guanido-arginine and measuring urinary (15)NO(3) and [(15)N]-urea. PPARα deficiency resulted in a markedly lower whole-body NO synthesis, whereas the conversion of systemic arginine into urea remained unaffected. PPARα deficiency also increased plasma arginine and decreased citrulline concentration in plasma. These changes could not be ascribed to a direct effect on hepatic target genes, since NOS mRNA levels were unaffected, and arginase mRNA levels decreased in KO mice. Despite the low level in the diet, the nature of the fatty acids modulated some effects of PPARα deficiency, including plasma arginine and urea, which increased more in KO mice fed the LIN diet than in those fed the COCO diet. In conclusion, PPARα is largely involved in normal whole-body NO synthesis.

The proportions of total monounsaturated FA, palmitoleic  (16:1), oleic  (18:1ω-9) and dihomo-γ- (DGLA, 20:3ω-6) in serum phospholipids, and DGLA/linoleic  (LA) (20:3ω-6/18:2ω-6), deta9-desaturase activity (D9D-16: 16:1/16:0 and D9D-18: 18:1ω-9/18:0) significantly increased corresponding to the number of MetS RFs, but D5D (20:4ω-6/20:3ω-6) decreased. baPWV positively correlated with HOMA-IR, palmitic  (16:0), oleic , D6D (18:3ω-6/18:2ω-6), DGLA/LA and D9D-18, and negatively with adiponectin, LDL size, LA, docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6ω-3) and D5D. Multiple stepwise regression models revealed that baPWV was significantly influenced by systolic blood pressure, age, body weight, triglyceride and LA in serum phospholipids (R(2) = 0.378). Interestingly, baPWV (1419 ± 1 cm/s) and MetS (22%) were highest in individuals with lower proportion of LA (< 12.361%) and higher proportion of DGLA (≥ 1.412%) in serum phospholipid FAs.The features of MetS significantly related to serum phosopholipid FA composition. Particularly, arterial stiffness was associated with LA additively together with DLGA. It may suggest a potential benefit of sufficient amounts of LA in serum or in diet can reduce cardiovascular risk.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Insulin resistance (IR) occurs in 50-70% of women with PCOS. In this study, we aimed to characterize the plasma phospholipid fatty  profile for PCOS patients with and without IR, as well as for the early prognosis of PCOS and its IR complication. A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) followed by multivariate statistical analysis was established to globally characterize the phospholipid fatty  profiles in plasma from non-IR PCOS, IR PCOS, and eligible healthy controls, and subsequently discovered fatty  biomarkers. A total of 22 fatty acids were identified and quantified. Their proportions varied among three groups, suggesting each group has its own fatty  pattern. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) according to their fatty  profiles showed that 29 tested samples could be clearly differentiated according to groups. More importantly, nervonic  (C24:1 n-9) and dihomo-γ- (C20:3 n-6) were identified as the potential fatty  biomarkers of PCOS and its IR complication, respectively, for their most contribution to group separation. Pearson correlation analysis indicated that C24:1 n-9 and C20:3 n-6 were well correlated with clinical characteristics of PCOS and IR indicators, respectively. These findings demonstrated that GC-MS-based plasma phospholipid fatty  profile might provide a complementary approach for clinical diagnosis of PCOS and its IR complication.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

EFAs are readily available in the diet. But, to derive their full benefit, EFAs need to be metabolized to their respective long-chain metabolites. EFAs not only form precursors to respective prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), and leukotrienes (LTs), but also give rise to lipoxins (LXs), resolvins, isoprostanes, and hydroxy- and hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoates. Certain PGs, TXs, and LTs have pro-inflammatory actions whereas LXs and resolvins are anti-inflammatory in nature. Furthermore, EFAs and their long-chain metabolites modulate the activities of angiotensin converting and HMG-CoA reductase enzymes, enhance acetylcholine levels in the brain, increase the synthesis of endothelial nitric oxide, augment diuresis, and enhance insulin action. Thus, EFAs and their metabolites may function as endogenous ACE and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, nitric oxide enhancers, beta-blockers, diuretics, anti-hypertensive, and anti-atherosclerotic molecules. In addition, EFAs and their long-chain metabolites react with nitric oxide (NO) to yield respective nitroalkene derivatives that exert cell-signaling actions via ligation and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Thus, EFAs and their derivatives have varied biological actions that may have relevance to their involvement in several physiological and pathological processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25083916>Natural product agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ): a review.</a></h2><p>Agonists of the nuclear receptor PPARγ are therapeutically used to combat hyperglycaemia associated with the  and type 2 diabetes. In spite of being effective in normalization of blood glucose levels, the currently used PPARγ agonists from the thiazolidinedione type have serious side effects, making the discovery of novel ligands highly relevant. Natural products have proven historically to be a promising pool of structures for drug discovery, and a significant research effort has recently been undertaken to explore the PPARγ-activating potential of a wide range of natural products originating from traditionally used medicinal plants or dietary sources. The majority of identified compounds are selective PPARγ modulators (SPPARMs), transactivating the expression of PPARγ-dependent reporter genes as partial agonists. Those natural PPARγ ligands have different binding modes to the receptor in comparison to the full thiazolidinedione agonists, and on some occasions activate in addition PPARα (e.g. genistein, biochanin A, sargaquinoic , sargahydroquinoic , resveratrol, amorphastilbol) or the PPARγ-dimer partner retinoid X receptor (RXR; e.g. the neolignans magnolol and honokiol). A number of in vivo studies suggest that some of the natural product activators of PPARγ (e.g. honokiol, amorfrutin 1, amorfrutin B, amorphastilbol) improve  parameters in diabetic animal models, partly with reduced side effects in comparison to full thiazolidinedione agonists. The bioactivity pattern as well as the dietary use of several of the identified active compounds and plant extracts warrants future research regarding their therapeutic potential and the possibility to modulate PPARγ activation by dietary interventions or food supplements.Copyright © 2014 The Authors.

We hypothesized that as seen during the fasting state, the intake of a walnut-enriched meal increased postprandial adiponectin. Twenty-one healthy white men followed a 4-week baseline diet and then consumed 3 fat-loaded meals that included 1 g fat/kg body weight (65% fat) according to a randomized crossover design: olive oil-enriched meal (22% saturated fatty acids [SFA], 38% monounsaturated fatty acids [MUFA], 4% polyunsaturated fatty acids [PUFA]), butter-enriched meal (35% SFA, 22% MUFA, 4% PUFA), and walnut-enriched meal (20% SFA, 24% MUFA, 16% PUFA, and 4% α-). Leptin, resistin, adiponectin, and free fatty acids were determined at 0, 3, 6, and 8.5 hours after the fat load. After the walnut-enriched meal, plasma adiponectin concentrations were higher at 3 and 6 hours (P = .011, P = .046, respectively) compared with the butter-enriched meal and higher at 6 hours compared with the olive oil-enriched meal (P = .036). Free fatty  levels decreased from baseline at 3 hours after the walnut-enriched meal (P = .001). No differences were observed between the 3 meals for leptin and resistin responses. Our data confirmed a beneficial profile in the postprandial response to walnuts, source of omega-3 PUFA with an increased postprandial adiponectin and lower postprandial free fatty  responses. These findings suggest that the postprandial state is important for understanding the possible cardioprotective effects associated with omega-3 PUFA dietary fat.© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The FADS2 product introduces a double bond at the Δ6, Δ4 and Δ8 positions by acting on at least ten substrates, including 16:0, 18:2n-6, and 18:3n-3. Our aim was to characterize the competition for accessing FADS2 mediated Δ6 desaturation between 16:0 and the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the human diet, 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3, to evaluate whether competition may be relevant in other tissues and thus linked to  abnormalities associated with FADS2 or fatty  levels. MCF7 cells stably transformed with FADS2 biosynthesize 16:1n-10 from exogenous 16:0 in preference to 16:1n-7, the immediate product of SCD highly expressed in cancer cell lines, and 16:1n-9 via partial β-oxidation of 18:1n-9. Increasing availability of 18:2n-6 or 18:3n-3 resulted in decreased bioconversion of 16:0 to 16:1n-10, simultaneously increasing the levels of highly unsaturated products. FADS2 cells accumulate the desaturation-elongation products 20:3n-6 and 20:4n-3 in preference to the immediate desaturation products 18:3n-6 and 18:4n-3 implying prompt/coupled elongation of the nascent desaturation products. MCF7 cells incorporate newly synthesized 16:1n-10 into phospholipids. These data suggest that excess 16:0 due to, for instance, de novo lipogenesis from high carbohydrate or alcohol consumption, inhibits synthesis of highly unsaturated fatty acids, and may in part explain why supplemental preformed EPA and DHA in some studies improves insulin resistance and other factors related to diabetes and  aggravated by excess calorie consumption.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Possible interactions between these factors were investigated in male and female hamsters fed diets rich in either saturated fatty acids ( "butter" diet) or in  ( "linseed oil" diet). Gender effect predominated over the diet effect on cholesterol (CH) metabolism; compared to males, females exhibited lower concentrations of plasma total CH (-20 %, P<0.001), LDL-CH (-40 %, P<0.001) and HDL-CH (-16 %, P<0.001), together with higher LDL receptor (+40 %) and lower HDL receptor (-60 %) hepatic content. Triacylglycerol (TG) metabolism was affected by diet above all: compared to animals fed the "butter" diet, those fed the "linseed oil" diet exhibited lower plasma (-23 %, P=0.046) and liver TG (-20 %, P=0.026) concentration which may result from both an increased beta-oxidation (P<0.001), without any change in PPARalpha mRNA, and a decreased hepatic lipogenesis (P=0.023), without increased sterol response element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) mRNA. The response to diet was much more pronounced in males than in females, without gender effect on the transcription level of PPARalpha and SREBP1c. Finally, the "linseed oil" diet decreased the insulin resistance index (-80 %, P<0.001) with a more marked effect in males, in relation to their higher hepatic PPARgamma expression (+90 %, P=0.012). In conclusion, in our model, the response of either TG or CH to dietary fatty acids is modulated differently by gender.

However, it has yet to be fully elucidated whether a serum PUFA profile is associated with hepatic steatosis.We aimed to clarify the relationship between a serum PUFA profile and liver lipid content.A cross-sectional study was conducted on 288 patients with dyslipidemia, diabetes, or coronary artery disease on statin therapy. Several PUFAs were measured, including eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), dihomo-γ- (DGLA) and arachidonic  (AA) in serum lipids, and Δ-5 desaturase (D5D) activity was estimated by AA to DGLA ratio. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) measured visceral fat area (VFA) and the ratio of CT attenuation for liver to spleen (L/S).The L/S ratio showed significant correlations with serum DGLA level and D5D activity (p<0.0001 for both). Serum DGLA level and D5D activity were significantly correlated with body mass index (BMI) or VFA, and with Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) (p<0.0001 for all). Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that a high DGLA level or low D5D activity was a significant determinant for hepatic steatosis (p<0.0001 for both) independent of BMI and HOMA-IR. ROC analysis revealed that they significantly enhanced the value of MetS-related factors in predicting hepatic steatosis (p<0.05 for both).A high DGLA level and low D5D activity in serum lipids may be useful markers predicting hepatic steatosis incrementally to MetS-related conventional factors.Copyright © 2016 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity.

The biosynthesis of the two main endocannabinoids, N-arachidonoylethanolamine and 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol, which derive from arachidonic , is influenced by dietary fatty acids (FAs). We investigated whether exposure to n-3 FA at a young age may decrease tissue endocannabinoid levels and prevent  disorders induced by a later high-fat diet (HFD) challenge. Three-week-old mice received a 5% lipid diet containing lard, lard plus safflower oil, or lard plus linseed oil for 10 weeks. Then, mice were challenged with a 30% lard diet for 10 additional weeks. A low n-6/n-3 FA ratio in the early diet induces a marked decrease in liver endocannabinoid levels. A similar reduction was observed in transgenic Fat-1 mice, which exhibit high tissue levels of n-3 FA compared with wild-type mice. Hepatic expression of key enzymes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism was concomitantly changed. Interestingly, some gene modifications persisted after HFD challenge and were associated with improved glycemic control. These findings indicate that early dietary interventions based on n-3 FA may represent an alternative strategy to drugs for reducing endocannabinoid tone and improving  parameters in the .© 2016 by the American Diabetes Association.

Desaturating enzymes, stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), delta-6 desaturase (D6D) and delta-5 desaturase (D5D) modulate fatty  composition and are thus associated with the development of . The aim of this study was to identify the relationships among DHA content, desaturase indices and the components of  in childhood obesity.Thirty-two obese children (27 male, 5 female) aged 12.0±2.6 years (mean±SD), with a relative body weight greater than 120% of the standard weight for sex, age and height, were recruited. Fatty  composition of plasma phospholipids was analyzed by gas chromatography, and the desaturase indices were assessed: SCD (16:1n-7/16:0 and 18:1n-9/18:0), D6D (20:3n-6/18:2n-6) and D5D (20:4n-6/20:3n-6).No sex difference was observed in fatty  composition. DHA content tended to have an inverse association with body mass index (BMI) (r=-0.337, p=0.0592), and correlated significantly with very low-density lipoprotein-triglyceride (r=-0.558, p=0.0057). In addition, DHA content had significant negative relationships with SCD indices (SCD16; r=-0.373, p=0.0357 and SCD18; r=-0.580, p=0.0005), which correlated positively with BMI(r=0.439, p=0.0120, r=0.353, p=0.0473, respectively), but had no association with D5D or D6D.DHA content in obese children was independent of the desaturation of . Reduced DHA content was associated with increased SCD index, and might contribute to the development of . Dietary management including fatty acids is suggested to be important to prevent and better manage obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23659066>[Low and very low density lipoproteins: pathogenetic and clinical significance].</a></h2><p>LDLP and VLDLP have different biological functions: phylogenetically older LDLP transfer FA that serve as substrates for intracellular production of energy and ATP while VLDLP transfer FA--precursors of cell membranes and eicosanoids. The cells absorb LDLP via apoB-100 endocytosis and VLDLP through apoE/B-100 receptors. VLDLP consist of palmitic and oleic VLDLP and LDLP of linoleic and  LDLP. The contribution of LDLP to the development of HLP atherosclerosis and atheromatosis is negligible. LDLP form palmitic and oleic VLDLP with hydrated LDLP density. Blockade of LDLP absorption by apoB endocytosis and deficit of poly-FA constitute the etiological basis of atherosclerosis. Its pathogenetic basis is the excess of palmitic VLDLP with LDPL density in the intercellular space that block absorption of linoleic LDLP with all transferred SC poly-FA. Atheromatosis is clinically and prognostically most significant symptom of atherosclerosis associated with accumulation of ligand-free VLDLP and LDLP in arterial intima of the elastic type as the local pool of interstitial tissue for intravascular pool of intercellular medium. Type 2 diabetes mellitus in aged patients is a symptom of atherosclerosis resulting from SC poly-FA deficit and GLUT4 incompetence. Insulin-dependent cells differ in the degree of insulin resistance. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, synthesis of a physiological palmitic TG by hepatocytes and excessive formation of palmitic VLDLP in liver integrate pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and hepatic steatosis. The main pathogenetic factor is the excess of palmitic s-FA and palmitic TG.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2832582>A new hepato-pancreato-renal disorder resembling tyrosinemia involving neuropathy and abnormal metabolism of polyunsaturated acids.</a></h2><p>This report describes a new disorder resembling hereditary tyrosinemia (HT) but differing from it in several respects. Similarities include failure to thrive with hypoproteinemia, micronodular cirrhosis, alpha-fetoprotein positive hepatocellular carcinoma, renal Fanconi  with renal tubular ectasia, hypermethioninemia, and hypoglycemia associated with islet cell hyperplasia. However, the tyrosine  pathway was intact. Unique findings include optic atrophy, cerebellar degeneration, and exocrine pancreatic hypoplasia. Polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) status was evaluated in the serum and liver. Initial PUFA profile to serum phospholipids revealed grossly elevated linoleic  and subnormal . All PUFAs derived from these precursors were absent suggesting gross abnormalities in the utilization of these two essential fatty acids for synthesis of longer chain highly unsaturated structural PUFA. Analysis of liver phospholipids indicated that linoleic  was lower and w3 and monenoic acids were higher than in the liver specimens from two cases of HT. The gross abnormalities in PUFA pattern, although perhaps secondary to another cause, represent serious structural and functional abnormalities of essential membrane lipids and potentially of eicosanoids derived from them.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22658641>What kind of polyunsaturated fatty  should we eat to stay healthy?</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30110883>Chia Seed Does Not Improve Cognitive Impairment in SAMP8 Mice Fed with High Fat Diet.</a></h2><p>Chia seed is an ancient seed with the richest plant source of α-, which has been demonstrated to improve  associated risk factors. Under high fat diet (HFD) condition, the senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) mice demonstrated worsen Alzheimer's disease (AD) related pathology compared to low fat diet fed SAMP8 mice.To explore whether chia seed supplementation might improve cognitive impairment under aging and  stress via high fat diet (HFD) fed SAMP8 mice as a model.SAMP8 mice and senescence-accelerated mouse-resistant 1 (SAMR1) were randomized into 4 groups, i.e., SAMR1 low fat diet group (SAMR1-LFD), SAMP8-HFD and SAMP8-HFD group supplemented with 10% chia seed (SAMP8-HFD+Chia). At the end of the intervention, cognitive function was measured via Morris water maze (MWM) test. Hippocampus and parietal cortex were dissected for further analysis to measure key markers involved AD pathology including Aβ, tau and neuro-inflammation.During navigation trials of MWM test, mice in SAMP8-LFD group demonstrated impaired learning ability compared to SAMR1-LFD group, and chia seed had no effect on learning and memory ability for HFD fed SAMP8 mice. As for Alzheimer's disease (AD) related pathology, chia seed not only increased α-secretase such as ADAM10 and insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), but also increased β-secretase including beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) and cathepsin B, with an overall effects of elevation in the hippocampal Aβ level; chia seed slightly reduced p-Tauser404 in the hippocampus; while an elevation in neuro-inflammation with the activation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Ibα-1 were observed post chia seed supplementation.Chia seed supplementation did not improve cognitive impairment via MWM in HFD fed SAMP8 mice. This might be associated with that chia seed increased key enzymes involved both in non-amyloidogenic and amyloidogenic pathways, and neuro-inflammation. Future studies are necessary to confirm our present study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25428743>Fatty  composition indicates two types of  independent of clinical and laboratory parameters.</a></h2><p>Dietary composition and metabolism of fatty acids (FA) influence insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidemia and other components of the  (MS). It is known that patients with MS exhibit a heterogeneous phenotype; however, the relationships of individual FA to MS components have not yet been consistently studied. We examined the plasma phosphatidylcholine FA composition of 166 individuals (68F/98M) with MS and of 188 (87F/101M) controls. Cluster analysis of FA divided the groups into two clusters. In cluster 1, there were 65.7 % of MS patients and 37.8 % of controls, cluster 2 contained 34.3 % of patients and 62.2 % of controls (P<0.001). Those with MS within cluster 1 (MS1) differed from individuals with MS in cluster 2 (MS2) by concentrations of glucose (P<0.05), NEFA (P<0.001), HOMA-IR (P<0.05), and levels of conjugated dienes in LDL (P<0.05). The FA composition in MS1 group differed from MS2 by higher contents of palmitoleic (+30 %), gamma- (+22 %), dihomo-gamma- (+9 %) acids and by a lower content of linoleic  (-25 %) (all P<0.01). These FA patterns are supposed to be connected with the progression and/or impaired biochemical measures of MS (lipolysis, oxidative stress, dysglycidemia, and insulin resistance).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20012223>The consumption of food products from linseed-fed animals maintains erythrocyte omega-3 fatty acids in obese humans.</a></h2><p>Based on mechanistic and epidemiological data, we raise the question of the relationship between qualitative dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) changes and increase in obesity. In this double-blind trial, we studied the effects on 160 overweight volunteers (body mass index, BMI >30) of a 90 days experimental diet rich principally in animal fat with a low PUFA/saturated fatty  (SFA) ratio but a low n-6/n-3 ratio, using animal products obtained from linseed-fed animals. The control diet provided less animal fat, a higher PUFA/SFA ratio and a higher n-6/n-3 ratio. Both diets excluded seafood. In the experimental group, we observed a significant increase in red blood cell (RBC)  content and a slight increase in EPA and DHA derivatives, while in the control group we observed a significant reduction in EPA and DHA content. Between groups now, the difference in the three n-3 fatty acids changes in RBC was significant. This demonstrates that plasma EPA and DHA levels can be maintained without fish if products from linseed-fed animals are used. During the diets, we noted a significant reduction in weight, BMI and hip circumference within both groups of volunteers. However, no significant difference was observed between the control group and the experimental group. Interestingly, 150 days after the end of the trial (i.e., day 240), we noted a significant weight gain in the control group, whereas no significant weight gain was observed in the experimental group. This was also observed for the BMI and hip circumference. Moreover, significant differences in BMI (P < 0.05) and weight (P = 0.05) appeared between the two groups, showing in both cases a smaller increase in the experimental group. During the 90 days trial, we did not observe any differences between groups in terms of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol or triglycerides, suggesting that the saturate content and the P/S ratio are not as important as the n-6 and n-3 fatty  composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28558700>Punicic : A striking health substance to combat  syndromes in humans.</a></h2><p>Punicic , a bioactive compound of pomegranate seed oil has gained wide attention for their therapeutic potential.
