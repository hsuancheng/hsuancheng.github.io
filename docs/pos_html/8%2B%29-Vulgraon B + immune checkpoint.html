Because of its generally immunosuppressive role, TGF-β has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in cancer immunotherapy. : This article looks at specific mechanisms of how TGF-β controls the function of various   subsets in the tumor microenvironment and focusses on T-cells. Various inhibition tools of TGF-β signaling and potential targets of therapeutic intervention are assessed along with the recent progress in combining TGF-β blockade and -mediated therapies. To round off the article, a summary of results from clinical trials is provided in which TGF-β blockade has shown therapeutic benefit for patients. : Data from preclinical models have shown that blocking TGF-β signaling can overcome resistance mechanisms and in combination with - therapies, can yield additive or synergistic anti-tumor responses. The future of immunooncology will therefore be based on combination trials. Since response rates may critically depend on both cancer type and stage, selection of only those patients who can benefit from combinatorial immunotherapy regimens is of utmost importance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31027701>Improvement in the survival of patients with stage IV non-small- lung cancer: Experience in a single institutional 1995-2017.</a></h2><p>In the past two decades several antineoplastic agents have been approved for the treatment of advanced non-small- lung cancer (NSCLC), and the management of these patients has drastically changed. However, there is limited information regarding the impact of these advances on patient survival in clinical practice.We analyzed the survival of patients with stage IV NSCLC who received any treatment in the Cancer Institute Hospital of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research (JFCR) between January 1, 1995 and March 1, 2017. A total of 1,547 consecutive patients were included in this case series. In this analysis, five diagnostic periods were evaluated: 1995-1999 (period A), 2000-2004 (period ), 2005-2009 (period C), 2010-2014 (period D), and 2015-2017 (period E). We compared overall survival (OS) between the periods before and after propensity score matching (PSM) and in patients with EGFR mutation, with ALK fusion gene, or without driver mutation.In the past two decades the OS of patients with stage IV NSCLC improved. The median OSs for periods A, , C, D, and E were 9.0, 11.0, 13.7, 17.9 months, and not reached, respectively. After PSM with known baseline characteristics, the trend of improvement in OS was similar. However, the OS of patients with EGFR mutation or ALK fusion gene did not improve between periods, despite the availability of several tyrosine kinase inhibitors in Japan. The OS of patients without a driver mutation was slightly longer in the period E.The introduction of new classes of drugs has significantly improved the survival of patients with stage IV NSCLC. However, the approval of similar types of drugs may not be associated with further improvement in survival.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for PD-L1 have been approved for treatment of various cancer types. Although PD-L1 blockade has proven its merit, there are still several aspects that require further attention to fully capitalize on its potential. One of these is the development of antigen-binding moieties that enable PD-L1 diagnosis and therapy. We generated human PD-L1 binding single domain antibodies (sdAbs) and selected sdAb K2, a sdAb with a high affinity for PD-L1, as a lead compound. SPECT/CT imaging in mice following intravenous injection of Technetium-99m (Tc)-labeled sdAb K2 revealed high signal-to-noise ratios, strong ability to specifically detect PD-L1 in melanoma and breast tumors, and relatively low kidney retention, which is a unique property for radiolabeled sdAbs. We further showed using surface plasmon resonance that sdAb K2 binds to the same epitope on PD-L1 as the mAb avelumab, and antagonizes PD-1:PD-L1 interactions. Different human -based assays corroborated the PD-1:PD-L1 blocking activity, showing enhanced T- receptor signaling and tumor  killing when PD-1 T cells interacted with PD-L1 tumor cells. Taken together, we present sdAb K2, which specifically binds to human PD-L1, as a new diagnostic and therapeutic agent in cancer management.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31285907>Changes in store for early-stage non-small  lung cancer.</a></h2><p>The management of advanced non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) has been revolutionized in recent years with the introduction of biomarker-targeted molecular therapies and   inhibitors. In contrast, since adjuvant chemotherapy was first established twenty years ago as the standard of care, little has changed for resected early-stage (IB-IIIA) patients for whom the potential for cure is greatest. In this manuscript we will review recently presented data as well as ongoing/planned studies in this arena. So far, investigative efforts have yielded mixed results regarding the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in early-stage NSCLC, though a series of now better planned, biomarker-driven ongoing phase III trials may be more informative. Several innovative immunotherapy studies have already shown promising results principally in the neoadjuvant setting with a large number of pivotal neo-adjuvant and adjuvant trials now in progress. Given the more robust design and biomarker-focused approach of the new generation of studies, significant advances in the optimal curative treatment of early stage NSCLC are anticipated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31339627>Open chromatin landscape of rat microglia upon proinvasive or inflammatory polarization.</a></h2><p>Microglia are brain-resident, myeloid cells that play important roles in health and brain pathologies. Herein, we report a comprehensive, replicated, false discovery rate-controlled dataset of DNase-hypersensitive (DHS) open chromatin regions for rat microglia. We compared the open chromatin landscapes in untreated primary microglial cultures and cultures stimulated for 6 hr with either glioma-conditioned medium (GCM) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Glioma-secreted factors induce proinvasive and immunosuppressive activation of microglia, and these cells then promote tumor growth. The open chromatin landscape of the rat microglia consisted of 126,640 reproducible DHS regions, among which 2,303 and 12,357 showed a significant change in openness following stimulation with GCM or LPS, respectively. Active genes exhibited constitutively open promoters, but there was no direct dependence between the aggregated openness of DHS regions near a gene and its expression. Individual regions mapped to the same gene often presented different patterns of openness changes. GCM-regulated DHS regions were more frequent in areas away from gene bodies, while LPS-regulated regions were more frequent in introns. GCM and LPS differentially affected the openness of regions mapped to   genes. The two treatments differentially affected the aggregated openness of regions mapped to genes in the Toll-like receptor signaling and axon guidance pathways, suggesting that the molecular machinery used by migrating microglia is similar to that of growing axons and that modulation of these pathways is instrumental in the induction of proinvasive polarization of microglia by glioma. Our dataset of open chromatin regions paves the way for studies of gene regulation in rat microglia.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31061392>RGMB enhances the suppressive activity of the monomeric secreted form of CTLA-4.</a></h2><p>The immunoregulatory molecule CTLA-4 plays a crucial role in the maintenance of  homeostasis. CTLA-4-neutralizing antibodies are now approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma, and are in development for treating other cancers as well. However, a thorough understanding of CTLA-4 function at the molecular level is necessary in order to develop strategies to prevent the unintended autoimmunity that is frequently associated with systemic blockade of CTLA-4 activity. Here, we describe an extracellular molecule, repulsive guidance molecule  (RGMB) as a novel binding partner of CTLA-4. RGMB expression was detected at high levels in dendritic  subsets that have been suggested to have tolerogenic capabilities. RGMB binds an extracellular domain of CTLA-4, and specifically strengthens the binding of the monomeric, soluble form of CTLA-4 (sCTLA-4) to CD80, enhancing CTLA-4's suppressive effect on co-stimulation. Examination of expression data from tumor tissues revealed a negative correlation between RGMB expression and  activation status in the majority of non-hematologic tumor tissues. These findings advance our understanding of CTLA-4 activity, as well as identify the RGMB/CTLA-4 binding interface as a potential target for the development of novel   blockade therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31267559>The MHC class I-LILRB1 signalling axis as a promising target in cancer therapy.</a></h2><p>  inhibitors are among the newest, cutting-edge methods for the treatment of cancer. Currently, they primarily influence T  adaptive immunotherapy targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4/B7 signalling pathways. These inhibitors fight cancer by reactivating the patient's own adaptive  system, with good results in many cancers. With the discovery of the "Don't Eat Me" molecule, CD47, antibody-based drugs that target the macrophage-related innate immunosuppressive signalling pathway, CD47-SIRPα, have been developed and have achieved stunning results in the laboratory and the clinic, but there remain unexplained instances of tumour  escape. While investigating the immunological tolerance of cancer to anti-CD47 antibodies, a second "Don't Eat Me" molecule on tumour cells, beta 2 microglobulin (β2m), a component of MHC class I, was described. Some tumour cells reduce their surface expression of MHC class I to escape T  recognition. However, other tumour cells highly express β2m complexed with the MHC class I heavy chain to send a "Don't Eat Me" signal by binding to leucocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor family , member 1 (LILRB1) on macrophages, leading to a loss of  surveillance. Investigating the mechanisms underlying this immunosuppressive MHC class I-LILRB1 signalling axis in tumour-associated macrophages will be useful in developing therapies to restore macrophage function and control MHC class I signalling in patient tumours. The goal is to promote adaptive immunity while suppressing the innate  response to tumours. This work will identify new therapeutic targets for the development of pharmaceutical-based tumour immunotherapy.© 2019 The Foundation for the Scandinavian Journal of Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31225971>Prospects for a personalized peptide vaccine against lung cancer.</a></h2><p>: The tumor characteristics and immunological status of the host should be carefully considered for the successful development of cancer peptide vaccines. Recently, personalized peptide vaccines (PPV) that individually select antigens for each patient are being developed for lung cancer. : Novel PPV, in which appropriate vaccine antigens are selected in each patient by assessing preexisting immunity to a panel of vaccine peptide candidates, have been attempted with promising results in early-phase clinical trials for lung cancer. Additionally, PPV targeting neo-antigens derived from genetic mutations have been currently attempted with high anticipation of success in various cancers, because they can be recognized as foreign by the host  system. In this review, we present an overview of the current progress and future directions of such PPV for patients with lung cancer. : Both genetic characterization of tumor cells and assessment of the  responses to potential tumor antigens might be a key component for facilitating successful cancer vaccine development. In addition, not only selection of immunogenic epitopes, but also appropriate modulation of the host immunological status should be considered; clinical trials combining neo-antigen vaccines and anti-PD-1 antibodies for lung cancer are currently ongoing and their results are awaited.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645447>Differential Expression of   Molecules on CD8 T Cells Specific for Immunodominant and Subdominant Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Epitopes.</a></h2><p>Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) causes a lifelong infection of neurons that innervate barrier sites like the skin and mucosal surfaces like the eye. After primary infection of the cornea, the virus enters latency within the trigeminal ganglion (TG), from which it can reactivate throughout the life of the host. Viral latency is maintained, in part, by virus-specific CD8 T cells that nonlethally interact with infected neurons. When CD8 T  responses are inhibited, HSV-1 can reactivate and these recurrent reactivation events can lead to blinding scarring of the cornea. In the C57BL/6 mouse, CD8 T cells specific to the immunodominant epitope from glycoprotein  maintain functionality throughout latency while CD8 T cells specific to subdominant epitopes undergo functional impairment that is associated with the expression of the inhibitory  molecule programmed death 1 (PD-1). Here, we investigate the  molecule, T- immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (Tim-3), which has traditionally been associated with CD8 T  exhaustion. Unexpectedly, we found that Tim-3 was preferentially expressed on highly functional ganglionic CD8 T cells during acute and latent HSV-1 infection. This, paired with data that show that Tim-3 expression on CD8 T cells in the latently infected TG is influenced by viral gene expression, suggests that Tim-3 is an indicator of recent T  stimulation, rather than functional compromise, in this model. We conclude that Tim-3 expression is not sufficient to define functional compromise during latency; however, it may be useful in identifying activated cells within the TG during HSV-1 infection. Without an effective means of eliminating HSV-1 from latently infected neurons, efforts to control the virus have centered on preventing viral reactivation from latency. Virus-specific CD8 T cells within the infected TG have been shown to play a crucial role in inhibiting viral reactivation and with a portion of these cells exhibiting functional impairment,  molecule immunotherapies have presented a potential solution to enhancing the anti-viral response of these cells. In pursuing this potential treatment strategy, we found that Tim-3 (often associated with CD8 T  functional exhaustion) is not upregulated on impaired cells but is instead upregulated on highly functional cells that have recently received antigenic stimulation. These findings support a role for Tim-3 as a marker of activation rather than exhaustion in this model, and we provide additional evidence for the hypothesis that there is persistent viral gene expression in the HSV-1 latently infected TG.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31270810>Targeting the tumor microenvironment and T  metabolism for effective cancer immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>The successful implementation of immunotherapies has provided new impetus in the fight against cancer. Antibody-mediated blockade of   molecules PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 has had a dramatic impact upon the treatment of previously intractable cancers such as malignant melanoma, while adoptive  therapies using chimeric antigen receptor-bearing T cells have proven highly efficacious in   leukemia.

Inhibiting the   through naturalizing programmed death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is proved to be a successful therapeutic regime for lymphoma. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are unceasingly reported to be promising biological targets for the cancer therapies. This study planned to explore the regulation of small nucleolar RNA host gene 14 (SNHG14) on DLBCL. SNHG14 level in DLBCL samples and  lines was analyzed by GEPIA bioinformatics tool and RT-qPCR. Biological functions of SNHG14 in DLBCL were detected by CCK-8, colony formation, and transwell invasion assays. Molecular interaction was determined by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and luciferase reporter assays. MiR-5590-3p-related pathway was identified through KEGG pathway analysis applying DAVID6.8 online bioinformatics tool. Effect of SNHG14 on CD8+ T cells was detected by flow cytometry. Results depicted that SNHG14 was upregulated in DLBCL and its depletion retarded proliferation, migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanistically, SNHG14 sponged miR-5590-3p to upregulate Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), and ZEB1 transcriptionally activated SNHG14 and PD-L1 to promote the  evasion of DLBCL cells. In conclusion, we firstly showed that SNHG14/miR-5590-3p/ZEB1 positive feedback loop promoted diffuse large   lymphoma progression and  evasion through regulating PD-1/PD-L1 , indicating that targeting SNHG14 was a potential approach to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in DLBCL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31431181>The macrophage  CD47 : SIRPα for recognition of 'self' cells: from clinical trials of blocking antibodies to mechanobiological fundamentals.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapies against some solid tumour types have recently shown unprecedented, durable cures in the clinic, and the most successful thus far involves blocking inhibitory receptor '' on T cells. A similar approach with macrophages is emerging by blocking the ubiquitously expressed 'marker of self' CD47 from binding the inhibitory receptor SIRPα on macrophages. Here, we first summarize available information on the safety and efficacy of CD47 blockade, which raises some safety concerns with the clearance of 'self' cells but also suggests some success against haematological (liquid) and solid cancers.  blockade generally benefits from parallel activation of the  , which can occur for macrophages in multiple ways, such as by combination with a second, tumour-opsonizing antibody and perhaps also via rigidity sensing. Cytoskeletal forces in phagocytosis and inhibitory 'self'-signalling are thus reviewed together with macrophage mechanosensing, which extends to regulating levels of SIRPα and the nuclear protein lamin A, which affects phenotype and  trafficking. Considerations of such physical factors in cancer and the  system can inform the design of new immunotherapies and help to refine existing therapies to improve safety and efficacy.

However, -resistant cancer cells can evade the  system and proceed to form tumors. The normal microenvironment ( cells, fibroblasts, blood and lymphatic vessels, and interstitial extracellular matrix (ECM)) maintains tissue homeostasis and prevents tumor initiation. Inflammatory mediators, reactive oxygen species, cytokines, and chemokines from an altered microenvironment promote tumor growth. During the last decade, thyroid cancer, the most frequent cancer of the endocrine system, has emerged as the fifth most incident cancer in the United States (USA), and its incidence is steadily growing. Inflammation has long been associated with thyroid cancer, raising critical questions about the role of  cells in its pathogenesis. A plethora of  cells and their mediators are present in the thyroid cancer ecosystem. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting  , such as mAbs anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (anti-CTLA-4) and anti-programmed  death protein-1/programmed  death ligand-1 (anti-PD-1/PD-L1), have revolutionized the treatment of many malignancies, but they induce thyroid dysfunction in up to 10% of patients, presumably by enhancing autoimmunity. Combination strategies involving   inhibitors (ICIs) with tyrosine kinase (TK) or serine/threonine protein kinase -raf (BRAF) inhibitors are showing considerable promise in the treatment of advanced thyroid cancer. This review illustrates how different  cells contribute to thyroid cancer development and the rationale for the antitumor effects of ICIs in combination with BRAF/TK inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31409608>CD47 Expression Defines Efficacy of Rituximab with CHOP in Non-Germinal Center - (Non-GCB) Diffuse Large - Lymphoma Patients (DLBCL), but Not in GCB DLBCL.</a></h2><p>Addition of rituximab (R) to "CHOP" (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) chemotherapy improved outcome for diffuse large - lymphoma (DLBCL) patients. Approximately 40% of patients who receive R-CHOP still succumb to disease due to intrinsic resistance or relapse. A potential negative regulator of DLBCL treatment outcome is the CD47 "don't eat me"  . To delineate the impact of CD47, we used a clinically and molecularly well-annotated cohort of 939 DLBCL patients, comprising both germinal center - (GCB) and non-GCB DLBCL subtypes, treated with either CHOP or R-CHOP. High (above median)  mRNA expression correlated with a detrimental effect on overall survival (OS) when DLBCL patients received R-CHOP therapy ( = 0.001), but not CHOP therapy ( = 0.645). Accordingly, patients with low  expression benefited most from the addition of rituximab to CHOP [HR, 0.32; confidence interval (CI), 0.21-0.50;  < 0.001]. This negative impact of high  expression on OS after R-CHOP treatment was only evident in cancers of non-GCB origin (HR, 2.09; CI, 1.26-3.47;  = 0.004) and not in the GCB subtype (HR, 1.16; CI, 0.68-1.99;  = 0.58). This differential impact of  in non-GCB and GCB was confirmed , as macrophage-mediated phagocytosis stimulated by rituximab was augmented by CD47-blocking antibody only in non-GCB  lines. Thus, high expression of  mRNA limited the benefit of addition of rituximab to CHOP in non-GCB patients, and CD47-blockade only augmented rituximab-mediated phagocytosis in non-GCB  lines.

We investigated whether infection with Epstein Barr virus (EBV) associates with development and severity of colitis in patients receiving   inhibitor therapies.We performed a retrospective analysis of fixed colon tissues from 16 patients (12 men, 4 women, median age, 69.5 y) with colitis after   inhibitor therapy (9 patients treated with anti-CTLA4, 3 patients treated with anti-PD1, and 4 patients received a combination). Ten tissue samples were biopsies and 6 were collected during resection (4 surgeries for colon perforation). Patients were treated between 2010 and 2018 in the United Kingdom. The tissues were analyzed by pathology, in situ hybridization (to detect EBV-encoded small RNAs [EBERs]), and immunohistochemistry. Clinical data were also collected.Colon tissues from 4 of the 13 patients who received anti-CTLA4 (alone or in combination, 4 with colon perforation) had EBV-positive lymphoproliferations that manifested as florid ulcers associated with polymorphous infiltrates containing EBV-positive blasts (CD30+ or CD30-negative, CD20+, CD3-negative, and EBER+), plasma cells (CD138+, CD20-negative, and EBER+ or EBER-negative), and small  cells (CD20+, CD3-negative, and EBER+ or EBER-negative), consistent with EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcers (EBVMCUs). In analyses of biopsies collected from 2 patients with EBVMCUs over multiple time points, we found that earlier biopsies had no or only a few EBV-positive cells, whereas 1 later biopsy had EBVMCU and co-infection with cytomegalovirus. EBVMCUs were associated with steroid-refractory colitis (100% of EBV-positive patients vs 12.5% of EBV-negative patients; P=.008) and colon perforation (100% of EBV-positive patients vs no EBV-negative patients; P=.001).We found that colon tissues from 4/13 patients with colitis after anti-CTLA4 therapy (4/6 patients who underwent resection and 4/4 patients with colon perforation) contained EBVMCUs. EBVMCUs seem to arise secondarily in areas of inflamed colon due to immunosuppressive treatment for colitis.

Efficient strategies and targets need to be identified to overcome T- exhaustion and further improve overall responses in the clinic. Here, we took advantage of the Eμ-TCL1 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and B16 melanoma mouse models to assess the role of the homophilic -surface receptor SLAMF6 as an - regulator. The transfer of SLAMF6 Eμ-TCL1 cells into SLAMF6 recipients, in contrast to wild-type (WT) recipients, significantly induced expansion of a PD-1 subpopulation among CD3CD44CD8 T cells, which had impaired cytotoxic functions. Conversely, administering anti-SLAMF6 significantly reduced the leukemic burden in Eμ-TCL1 recipient WT mice concomitantly with a loss of PD-1CD3CD44CD8 T cells with significantly increased effector functions. Anti-SLAMF6 significantly reduced leukemic burden in the peritoneal cavity, a niche where antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is impaired, possibly through activation of CD8 T cells. Targeting of SLAMF6 affected tumor growth not only in  -related leukemia and lymphomas but also in nonhematopoietic tumors such as B16 melanoma, where SLAMF6 is not expressed.  exhausted CD8 T cells showed increased degranulation when anti-human SLAMF6 was added in culture. Taken together, anti-SLAMF6 both effectively corrected CD8 T- dysfunction and had a direct effect on tumor progression.

Based on our previous studies showing reduced MCAO infarct volumes in PDL2 deficient mice, we evaluated the ability of anti-PDL2 mAb to treat MCAO in male and female C57BL/6 mice. We found that anti-PDL2 neutralizing antibody treatment of MCAO significantly reduced infarct volumes in male mice but had no protective effects in female mice even at a 5-fold increased dose of anti-PDL2 mAb. The protection in male mice was likely mediated by reduced percentages in the spleen of PDL2CD19  cells, PDL1CD4 T cells and CD86CD11b macrophages in concert with reduced expression of PDL1 and TNFα and continued expression of CD206, in the injured ipsilateral brain hemisphere. The lack of a therapeutic benefit of anti-PDL2 on stroke-induced infarct volumes in female mice was reflected by no detectable reduction in expressed PDL2 or PDL1 and an increased frequency of Th and Th pro-inflammatory T  subsets in the spleen, an effect not seen in PDL2 mAb treated males.

Immunological understanding of the tumor microenvironment (TME) has led to great success in the development of clinical cancer immunotherapeutic. The most advanced cancer immunotherapies are chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells (CAR-T cells) and  inhibiting antibodies blocking CTLA4, PD-1 and PD-L1. However, many hurdles remain that should be addressed for improved therapeutic efficacy and reduced side effects such as cytokine release syndrome and patient-death.

In this review, we briefly introduce the immunosuppressive functions of TMICs and review recent advances in the development of TMIC-targeted nanotherapeutics for cancer immunotherapy. Tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-targeted systems have shown to deplete or repolarize macrophages to M1 state for anti-tumoral  responses. Tumor-infiltrating T  (TIT)-targeted strategies have provided the activation of effector T cells and suppression of regulatory T cells in tumor, overcoming the current hurdles of single regimen  inhibitors.

The expression of CTLA-4 on γδ T-cells and the B7-2 ligand on blasts was higher in patients with high-risk ALL (p=0.02 and 0.02, respectively). In AML, PD1 expression on αβ T-cells was higher in the intermediate-risk group (p=0.05), whereas HVEM expression was significantly higher in the low-risk group (p=0.02). Expression of CTLA-4 on γδ+ T-cells and PD-L1 on blasts were both associated with poor relapse-free survival outcomes in ALL (p=0.049).The higher expression of   molecules, in particular, CTLA-4 and PD-L1 are associated with a poorer prognosis in ALL, suggesting that selective use of the   blockade might improve the clinical outcomes in patients with ALL.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Among various mechanisms responsible for  suppression, arginase-1 (ARG1)-carrying small extracellular vesicles (EVs) emerge as important contributors to tumor growth and tumor escape from the host  system. Here, we report that small EVs found in the ascites and plasma of OvCa patients contain ARG1. EVs suppress proliferation of CD4 and CD8 T-cells in vitro and in vivo in OvCa mouse models. In mice, ARG1-containing EVs are transported to draining lymph nodes, taken up by dendritic cells and inhibit antigen-specific T- proliferation. Increased expression of ARG1 in mouse OvCa cells is associated with accelerated tumor progression that can be blocked by an arginase inhibitor. Altogether, our studies show that tumor cells use EVs as vehicles to carry over long distances and deliver to  cells a metabolic  molecule - ARG1, mitigating anti-tumor  responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31216214>Cancer combinatorial immunotherapy using anti-OX40 agonist and anti-PD-L1 antagonist: a patent evaluation of US2018256711A1.</a></h2><p>: OX40 is  inhibitor in cancer that coordinates the downregulation of the proliferation of antigen-specific lymphocytes.

It is the fourth therapeutic method with efficiency and safety in addition to surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. At present, anti-tumor  related clinical trials have made promising achievements in prolonging progression free survival and overall survival, therefore, FDA approved a variety of   blockers (ICBs) such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, ipilimumab. However, primary or acquired resistance results in massive perplexity to oncologist and patients. In order to bring further clinical benefit to tumor patients, study on mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance is extremely urgent. This review summarizes related mechanisms of tumor immunotherapy resistance, including MITF suppression, Ezh2 upregulation, TIM-3 upregulation, microRNA-driven deregulation of cytokine expression and et al. Genetic mutations such as PTEN loss, JAK1/2 loss-of-function mutations and Cbl- deficiency are also involved. Moreover, we have discussed feasible countermeasures, for instance, combining ICBs with PRRs agonists, ARNAX, CpG oligonucleotide, oncolytic peptide LTX-315 and indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase inhibitors, respectively. Other methods include combined ICBs with radiotherapy, combined ICBs with blockade of PI3K-AKT, TIM-3 pathway; blockade of Fcγ receptors before anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies administration and modulation of the gut microbiome, et al. Mechanisms and countermeasures of immunotherapy resistance still requires further exploration, in expectation to provide novel ideals and basis for tolerant patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540976>Triple Therapy with MerTK and PD1 Inhibition plus Radiotherapy Promotes Abscopal Antitumor  Responses.</a></h2><p>Radiotherapy (RT) traditionally has been used for local tumor control in the treatment of cancer. The recent discovery that radiotherapy can have anti-cancer effects on the  system has led to recognition of its ability to sensitize the tumor microenvironment to immunotherapy. However, radiation can also prompt adverse immunosuppressive effects that block aspects of systemic response at other tumor sites. Our hypothesis was that inhibition of the MER proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MerTK) in combination with anti-programmed  death-1 (α-PD1)  blockade will enhance -mediated responses to radiotherapy.We tested the efficacy of this triple therapy (Radiation + α-PD1 + α-MerTK mAbs) in 129Sv/Ev mice with bilateral lung adenocarcinoma xenografts. Primary tumors were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy (36 Gy in three 12-Gy fractions), and tumors were monitored for response.The triple therapy significantly delayed abscopal tumor growth, improved survival rates, and reduced numbers of lung metastases. We further found that the triple therapy increased the activated CD8 and NK cells populations measured by granzyme  expression with upregulation of CD8CD103 tissue-resident memory cells (T) within the abscopal tumor microenvironment relative to radiation only.The addition of α-PD1 + α-MerTK mAbs to radiotherapy could alter the  death to be more immunogenic and generate adaptive  response via increasing the retention of T cells in the tumor islets of the abscopal tumors which was proven to play a major role in survival of non-small  lung cancer patients.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31439251>Prognostic and predictive value of histogram analysis in patients with non-small  lung cancer refractory to platinum treated by nivolumab: A multicentre retrospective study.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to assess computed-tomography histogram analysis (CTHA) as prognostic and predictive factor in platinum-refractory non-small  lung carcinoma (NSCLC) treated with   inhibitor Nivolumab.One hundred and four patients were enrolled from 3 different centers. CT was performed using similar parameters among different scanners. CTHA was performed with the proprietary software TexRAD, which extracts histogram features at different spatial scale (spatial scale filters, SSF) producing 30 CTHA features per patients. Cross-validated Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator LASSO was used to select those features which were related to overall and progression-free survival (OS and PFS, respectively). High- and low-risk subgroups were identified using the best cutoff.Median follow-up was 13.8 weeks. Median OS and PFS were 7.3 and 3 months, respectively. LASSO selected kurtosis obtained by SSF = 4 mm as the single feature related to OS, leading to an hazard ratio (HR) of 0.476 (95%CI 0.29-0.77). PFS was related with kurtosis SSF = 6 mm, with HR of 0.556 (95%CI 0.36-0.86).Despite its limitations, this study is the first which suggests that CTHA could play a role in stratifying prognosis and treatment response in patients with NSCLC treated with Nivolumab.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

The EGFR pathway plays a key role in the tumorigenesis and progression of this disease as well as in the resistance to radiotherapy (RT). While several anti-EGFR agents have been tested in HNSCC, cetuximab, an IgG1 subclass monoclonal antibody against EGFR, is the only drug with proven efficacy for the treatment of both locoregionally-advanced (LA) and recurrent/metastatic (R/M) disease. The addition of cetuximab to radiotherapy is a validated treatment option in LA-HNSCC. However, its use has been limited to patients who are considered unfit for standard of care chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with single agent cisplatin given the lack of direct comparison of these two regimens in randomized phase III trials and the inferiority suggested by metanalysis and phase II studies. The current use of cetuximab in HNSCC is about to change given the recent results from randomized prospective clinical trials in both the LA and R/M setting. Two phase III studies evaluating RT-cetuximab vs. CRT in Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-positive LA oropharyngeal squamous  carcinoma (De-ESCALaTE and RTOG 1016) showed inferior overall survival and progression-free survival for RT-cetuximab combination, and therefore CRT with cisplatin remains the standard of care in this disease. In the R/M HNSCC, the EXTREME regimen has been the standard of care as first-line treatment for the past 10 years. However, the results from the KEYNOTE-048 study will likely position the anti-PD-1 agent pembrolizumab as the new first line treatment either alone or in combination with chemotherapy in this setting based on PD-L1 status. Interestingly, cetuximab-mediated immunogenicity through antibody dependent  cytotoxicity (ADCC) has encouraged the evaluation of combined approaches with - inhibitors in both LA and R/M-HNSCC settings. This article reviews the accumulated evidence on the role of cetuximab in HNSCC in the past decade, offering an overview of its current impact in the treatment of LA and R/M-HNSCC disease and its potential use in the era of immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31506076>IFN-gamma-induced PD-L1 expression in melanoma depends on p53 expression.</a></h2><p>  inhibition and in particular anti-PD-1 immunotherapy have revolutionized the treatment of advanced melanoma. In this regard, higher tumoral PD-L1 protein (gene name: CD274) expression is associated with better clinical response and increased survival to anti-PD-1 therapy. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that tumor suppressor proteins are involved in  regulation and are capable of modulating the expression of   proteins. Here, we determined the role of p53 protein (gene name: TP53) in the regulation of PD-L1 expression in melanoma.We analyzed publicly available mRNA and protein expression data from the cancer genome/proteome atlas and performed immunohistochemistry on tumors with known TP53 status. Constitutive and IFN-ɣ-induced PD-L1 expression upon p53 knockdown in wildtype, TP53-mutated or JAK2-overexpressing melanoma cells or in cells, in which p53 was rendered transcriptionally inactive by CRISPR/Cas9, was determined by immunoblot or flow cytometry. Similarly, PD-L1 expression was investigated after overexpression of a transcriptionally-impaired p53 (L22Q, W23S) in TP53-wt or a TP53-knockout melanoma  line. Immunoblot was applied to analyze the IFN-ɣ signaling pathway.For TP53-mutated tumors, an increased CD274 mRNA expression and a higher frequency of PD-L1 positivity was observed. Interestingly, positive correlations of IFNG mRNA and PD-L1 protein in both TP53-wt and -mutated samples and of p53 and PD-L1 protein suggest a non-transcriptional mode of action of p53. Indeed,  line experiments revealed a diminished IFN-ɣ-induced PD-L1 expression upon p53 knockdown in both wildtype and TP53-mutated melanoma cells, which was not the case when p53 wildtype protein was rendered transcriptionally inactive or by ectopic expression of p53, a transcriptionally-impaired variant, in TP53-wt cells. Accordingly, expression of p53 in a TP53-knockout melanoma  line boosted IFN-ɣ-induced PD-L1 expression. The impaired PD-L1-inducibility after p53 knockdown was associated with a reduced JAK2 expression in the cells and was almost abrogated by JAK2 overexpression.While having only a small impact on basal PD-L1 expression, both wildtype and mutated p53 play an important positive role for IFN-ɣ-induced PD-L1 expression in melanoma cells by supporting JAK2 expression. Future studies should address, whether p53 expression levels might influence response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31118078>Neurologic toxicity associated with   inhibitors: a pharmacovigilance study.</a></h2><p>  inhibitors (ICI) produce durable antitumor responses but provoke autoimmune toxicities, including uncommon but potentially devastating neurologic toxicities. The clinical features, including the spectrum, timing, and outcomes, of ICI-induced neurologic toxicities are not well characterized.We performed disproportionality analysis using Vigibase, the World Health Organization pharmacovigilance database, comparing neurologic adverse event (AE) reporting in patients receiving ICIs vs. the full database. Neurologic AEs were classified by group queries using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, between database inception to September 28, 2018. Associations between ICIs and neurologic AEs were assessed using reporting odds ratios (ROR) and information component (IC). IC compares observed and expected values to find associations between drugs and AEs using disproportionate Bayesian reporting; IC (lower end of the IC 95% credibility interval) > 0 is considered statistically significant.Among the full database, 18,518,994 AEs were reported, including 48,653 with ICIs. ICIs were associated with higher incidence of myasthenia gravis (0.47% of ICI reports vs. 0.04% of the full database, ROR 16.5 [95% CI 14.5-18.9]; IC 3.31), encephalitis (0.51% vs. 0.05%, ROR 10.4 [95% CI 9.2-11.8]; IC 3.15), peripheral neuropathy (1.16% vs. 0.67%, IC 0.68), and meningitis (0.15% vs. 0.06%, ROR 3.1 [95% CI 2.5-3.9]; IC 1.01). Myasthenia gravis and encephalitis were associated with anti-PD-1 whereas other neurologic AEs were associated with anti-CTLA-4. Myasthenia gravis was characterized by high fatality rates (~ 20%), early onset (median 29 days), and frequent concurrent myocarditis and myositis; whereas other neurologic AEs had lower fatality rates (6-12%), later onset (median 61-80 days), and were non-overlapping.ICIs produce a spectrum of distinct classes of neurologic AEs that can cause significant morbidity and mortality and tend to occur early and with class-specific associations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513709>Development of an Adrenocortical Cancer Humanized Mouse Model to Characterize Anti-PD1 Effects on Tumor Microenvironment.</a></h2><p>While the development of   inhibitors has transformed treatment strategies of several human malignancies, research models to study immunotherapy in ACC are lacking.To explore the effect of anti-PD1 immunotherapy on the alteration of the  milieu in ACC in a newly generated preclinical model and correlate with the response of the matched patient.To characterize the CU-ACC2-M2B patient-derived xenograft in a humanized mouse model, evaluate the effect of a PD-1 inhibitor therapy and compare to the CU-ACC2 patient with metastatic disease.Characterization of the CU-ACC2-hu-CB-BRGS model confirmed ACC origin and match with the original human tumor. Treatment of the mice with pembrolizumab demonstrated significant tumor growth inhibition (TGI = 60%) compared to controls, which correlated with increased tumor infiltrating lymphocyte activity, with an increase of human CD8+ T cells (p<0.05), HLA-DR+ T cells (p<0.05) as well as Granzyme + CD8+ T cells (<0.001). In parallel, treatment of the CU-ACC2 patient, who had progressive disease, demonstrated a partial response with 79%-100% reduction in the size of target lesions, and no new sites of metastasis.

MTOR-S6K1 and MEK-ERK signals are also transduced to GLI activators through post-translational modifications. The GLI transcription network up-regulates target genes, such as  and , in a cellular context-dependent manner. Aberrant Hedgehog signaling in tumor cells leads to self-renewal, survival, proliferation and invasion. Paracrine Hedgehog signaling in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which harbors cancer-associated fibroblasts, leads to angiogenesis, fibrosis,  evasion and neuropathic pain. Hedgehog-related genetic alterations occur frequently in basal  carcinoma (BCC) (85%) and Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)-subgroup medulloblastoma (87%) and less frequently in breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, non-small- lung cancer (NSCLC) and ovarian cancer. Among investigational SMO inhibitors, vismodegib and sonidegib are approved for the treatment of patients with BCC, and glasdegib is approved for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Resistance to SMO inhibitors is caused by acquired  mutations,  deletions,  amplification, other by-passing mechanisms of GLI activation and WNT/β-catenin signaling activation. GLI-DNA-interaction inhibitors (glabrescione  and GANT61), GLI2 destabilizers (arsenic trioxide and pirfenidone) and a GLI-deacetylation inhibitor (4SC-202) were shown to block GLI-dependent transcription and tumorigenesis in preclinical studies. By contrast, SMO inhibitors can remodel the immunosuppressive TME that is dominated by M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, and thus, a Phase I/II clinical trial of the   inhibitor pembrolizumab with or without vismodegib in BCC patients is ongoing.© 2019 The Author(s).

Human  system-engrafted models are used in immuno-oncology (IO) studies for subcutaneous cancer  or patient-derived xenograft implantations that mimic primary tumor growth. Novel efficacy models for IO compounds on bone metastases need to be established. The study was performed using CIEA NOG (NOG) mice engrafted with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (huNOG) and age-matched immunodeficient NOG mice. Bone phenotyping was performed to evaluate baseline differences. BT-474 human breast cancer cells were inoculated into the tibia bone marrow, and cancer-induced bone changes were monitored by X-ray imaging. Bone content and volume were analyzed by dual X-ray absorptiometry and microcomputed tomography. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and the expression of   markers were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Bone phenotyping showed no differences in bone architecture or volume of the healthy bones in huNOG and NOG mice, but the bone marrow fat was absent in huNOG mice. Fibrotic areas were observed in the bone marrow of some huNOG mice. BT-474 tumors induced osteoblastic bone growth. Bone lesions appeared earlier and were larger, and bone mineral density was higher in huNOG mice. huNOG mice had a high number of human CD3-, CD4-, and CD8-positive T cells and CD20-positive  cells in -related organs. A low number of TILs and PD-1-positive cells and low PD-L1 expression were observed in the BT-474 tumors at the endpoint. This study reports characterization of the first breast cancer bone growth model in huNOG mice. BT-474 tumors represent a "cold" tumor with a low number of TILs. This model can be used for evaluating the efficacy of combination treatments of IO therapies with -stimulatory compounds or therapeutic approaches on bone metastatic breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168399>Constitutive reduction in the  inhibitor, CTLA-4, does not accelerate SLE in NZM 2328 mice.</a></h2><p>Treatment with   inhibitors (ICIs) in oncology patients is increasing. Although ICIs trigger rheumatic -related adverse events, development of SLE features has been rare. Whether long-term treatment with ICIs would promote SLE features remains unknown. To begin to address this, we generated SLE-prone NZM 2328 mice with lifelong reduction in CTLA-4 expression.Since CTLA-4-deficient ( ) NZM mice developed a lethal lymphoproliferative disorder by 3-6 weeks of age, development of SLE in these mice could not be studied.  haploinsufficient NZM.   mice were assessed in parallel with littermate female NZM.   mice. Evaluations included CTLA-4 expression and lymphocyte profiles, assessed by fluorescence-activated  sorting; serological profiles, assessed by ELISA; renal immunopathology, assessed by histology and immunofluorescence; and clinical courses, assessed by mortality.CTLA-4 expression was lower in NZM.   mice than in NZM.   mice. Spleen mononuclear cells,  cells, plasma cells, CD4 cells, recently activated CD4 cells and CD4 T regulatory (Treg) cells were increased in NZM.   mice (p≤0.042). The serological profile, degree of renal immunopathology and mortality in NZM.   mice remained unaffected.Lifelong reduction in CTLA-4 expression in NZM mice neither accelerated nor aggravated SLE. Expansion in Treg cells may have played a protective role. Our observations raise the hope that long-term treatment of patients with SLE with an anti-CTLA-4 agent, should the need arise, would not adversely affect SLE disease activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609501>Cancer immunotherapy in patients with preexisting autoimmune diseases.</a></h2><p>We read with great interest the letter of Xie et al commenting on our article "Safety and Efficacy of   Inhibitors in Patients with Cancer and Preexisting Autoimmune Disease: A Nationwide Multicenter Cohort Study"(1).

It was reported that high level of serum B7-H4 level may be correlated with lymphoma. Nevertheless, the role of B7-H4 in Epstein-Barr Virus-Positive diffuse large   lymphoma (EBVDLBCL) has not been addressed although it has been suggested that B7-H4 could promote tumor growth and metastatic progression in certain cancers.Between January 2005 and November 2017 at the department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine affiliated Shanghai General Hospital 260 DLBCL samples were analyzed for EBV-encoded small RNA (EBV-EBER) by in situ hybridization. The expression level of B7-H4 in DLBCL tumor tissue was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, the role of B7-H4 in DLBCL was further investigated in DLBCL  line.EBVDLBCL patients suffered from markedly lower overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates in our study. We showed that B7-H4 was significantly overexpressed in 16 EBV-subgroup cases out of 260 DLBCL patients. We further found that EBV infection in lymphoblast cells led to enhanced expression of B7-H4 followed by increased  viability and reduced apoptosis. In contrast, inhibition of B7-H4 simultaneously impaired  viability and induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, inhibiting B7-H4 resulted in decreased phosphorylation Erk 1/2 and Akt.Our study reveals a critical role of B7-H4 in EBVDLBCL development by regulating  survival and apoptosis through the Erk and Akt signalling pathways.

Despite the integration of virus DNA and the oncoprotein HBx, chronic necroinflammation and hepatocellular regeneration account for hepatocarcinogenesis. As a non-cytopathic virus, HBV is extensively recognized to mediate chronic liver damage through abnormal  attack. However, the mechanisms driving HBV infection to HCC are poorly understood. During chronic HBV infection in humans, the adaptive immunity changes from  tolerance to progressive  activation, inactivation, reactivation and exhaustion, all of which may be the  pathogenic factors for the development of HCC. Recently, the immunopathogenic mechanisms were described in mouse HBV-induced HCC models, which is absolutely dependent on the presence of HBV-specific T  response and NK -derived IFN-γ, findings which are consistent with the observations from CHB and HCC patients. In this review, we summarize recent research progression on the HBV-specific CD8 T cells, and also CD4 T cells,  cells and non-specific  cells and molecules underlying chronic HBV infection and eventual HCC development to demonstrate the pathogenesis of HBV-induced  imbalance. Based on the progression, we discussed the potential of -based therapies and their challenges in the treatment of HBV-related HCC, including the  inhibition, genetically modified T  transfer, therapeutic vaccines and metabolic modulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31331862>Metastatic Renal  Carcinoma Rapidly Progressive to Sunitinib: What to Do Next?</a></h2><p>From 10% to 26% of patients with metastatic renal  carcinoma (mRCC) experience rapidly progressive disease (PD) on treatment with sunitinib.To investigate the benefit of subsequent treatment with another tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) or a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor in such primary refractory patients.A total of 150 mRCC patients with rapidly PD on first-line sunitinib (within two cycles, n=93, or four cycles, n=57) were identified: median age 59yr; nephrectomy 86%; histological subtypes: clear  (77.8%), papillary (14%), and sarcomatoid features (18%); according to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and French classifications: good risk (11% and 7%, respectively), intermediate (68% and 63%, respectively), and poor (21% and 29%, respectively).Data were retrospectively collected by a questionnaire from 19 European oncology centers between March 2005 and March 2011. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated (Kaplan-Meier method).Median OS from the start of first-line treatment was 7.4mo. Second-line treatment was administered to 86 (57%) patients (44 mTOR inhibitors: 23 everolimus and 21 temsirolimus; 39 TKIs alone or in combination; three chemotherapy). Second-line PFS was not significantly different between TKIs and mTOR inhibitors (2.0 vs 0.9mo; p=0.536). Median OS from the start of second-line treatment was 5.0mo for mTOR inhibitors and 6.6mo for TKIs (p=0.15).Treatment with further TKIs or mTOR inhibitors for mRCC patients primarily refractory to first-line sunitinib in the observed time period achieved very minimal benefit, suggesting avoiding TKI rechallenge and possibly preferring alternative strategies, such as   inhibitors, after PD to a treatment line including a TKI in this setting.The present work collected data about 150 patients affected by metastatic renal  carcinoma, who received one of the current standard of care as first-line treatment, namely, the antiangiogenic drug sunitinib, and experienced rapid worsening of the disease. We investigated and described the subsequent outcome of such patients treated with two different types of drug, administered as second-line therapy, to better understand the best strategy to adopt for patients who got no benefit from sunitinib and to describe the current therapeutic approach in such cases.Copyright © 2019 European Association of Urology.

Tissue damage driven by disrupted  tolerance against self-antigens is called an -related adverse event (irAE). irAEs in the liver histologically presents panlobular hepatitis (∼70%), isolated central zonal necrosis (∼20%), primarily granulomatous hepatitis (∼5%), and other minor forms of tissue injury (∼5%). Infiltrating cells are mainly lymphocytes and occasional eosinophils. Unlike classic autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), plasma  infiltration is not conspicuous. Immunostaining reveals a large number of CD8+ T lymphocytes and a markedly smaller number of CD4+ cells or CD20+  lymphocytes. The unique CD3+/CD20+ and CD4+/CD8+ ratios shifted in favor of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes are helpful to discriminate irAEs from other conditions (e.g., AIH, idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury). Another hepatobiliary manifestation of irAEs is sclerosing cholangitis clinically characterized by elevations of biliary enzymes, diffuse duct wall thickening, and duct dilatation. Lymphocytic infiltration can be observed by endoscopic biopsies from the thick extrahepatic bile ducts, and liver needle biopsies may also show severe lymphocytic cholangitis resembling primary biliary cholangitis. An important differential diagnosis of irAEs is previously asymptomatic or subclinical liver disease unmasked by cancer immunotherapy, which is often challenging and requires close clinicopathological correlations.Copyright © 2019.

Despite the prognostic impact of TILs, response to -inhibitors and antigen-specific active immunotherapy is limited in ovarian cancer. The goal of our study was to investigate the interaction between ovarian cancer and the innate and adaptive  system in the ID8-fLuc syngeneic ovarian cancer mouse model. For the  experiments C57BL/6, B6.129S7-Rag1/J, and B6.129P2(SJL)-Myd88/J mice were inoculated with ID8-fLuc.  depletion experiments were performed using clodronate liposomes (CL), anti-CD8a, anti-GR1, anti-colony stimulating factor 1 (anti-CSF1), and TMβ1 (anti-CD122).  read out was performed by fluorescent activated  sorting analysis for effector T cells, regulatory T cells, natural killer cells,  cells, macrophages, and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), immunohistochemistry for MDSC and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and immunofluorescence for M1 and M2 TAM in the vascular context. The effect of MDSC on T  proliferation and phenotype were studied . We discovered that the absence of T and  cells did not influence tumor growth or survival of B6.129S7-Rag1/J mice compared to immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice. CL-induced macrophage depletion promoted tumor proliferation and shortened survival in C57BL/6 mice ( = 0.004) and in B6.129S7-Rag1/J mice ( = 0.0005). During CL treatment, we observed a clear increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines ( ≤ 0.02) and monocytic MDSC ( ≤ 0.01). Selective depletion of MDSC by anti-GR1 improved survival, certainly in comparison to mice treated with anti-CSF1 ( = 0.01-median survival 91 vs. 67.5 days). B6.129P2(SJL)-Myd88/J mice displayed to a longer median survival compared to C57BL/6 mice (90 vs. 76 days). MDSC activated by ID8-fLuc conditioned medium or ascites of tumor-bearing mice showed T  suppressive functions . Based on these findings, we conclude that the adaptive  system does not efficiently control tumor growth in the ID8-fLuc model. In addition, we discovered a prominent role for MDSC as the driver of immunosuppression in the ID8-fLuc ovarian cancer mouse model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623665>Tumor-infiltrating  cells affect the progression of oropharyngeal squamous  carcinoma via -to- interactions with CD8 T cells.</a></h2><p>Standard treatment of oropharyngeal squamous  carcinoma (OPSCC) is associated with high morbidity, whereas immunotherapeutic approaches using PD-1:PD-L1  blockade only show moderate response rates in OPSCC patients. Therefore, a better stratification of patients and the development of novel therapeutic protocols are crucially needed. The importance of tumor-infiltrating  cells (TIL-Bs) in shaping antitumor immunity remains unclear; therefore, we analyzed frequency, phenotype, prognostic value and possible roles of TIL-Bs in OPSCC.We utilized transcriptomic analysis of  response-related genes in 18 OPSCC samples with respect to human papillomavirus (HPV) status. The density and localization of CD20, CD8 and DC-LAMP cells were subsequently analyzed in 72 tissue sections of primary OPSCC samples in relation to patients' prognosis. The immunohistochemical approach was supplemented by flow cytometry-based analysis of phenotype and functionality of TIL-Bs in freshly resected primary OPSCC tissues.We observed significantly higher expression of  -related genes and higher densities of CD20  cells in HPV-associated OPSCC samples. Interestingly, CD20 TIL-Bs and CD8 T cells formed non-organized aggregates with interacting cells within the tumor tissue. The densities of both intraepithelial CD20  cells and  /CD8 T  interactions showed prognostic significance, which surpassed HPV positivity and CD8 TIL density in stratification of OPSCC patients. High density of TIL-Bs was associated with an activated   phenotype, high CXCL9 production and high levels of tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells. Importantly, the abundance of direct  /CD8 T  interactions positively correlated with the frequency of HPV16-specific CD8 T cells, whereas the absence of  cells in tumor-derived  cultures markedly reduced CD8 T  survival.Our results indicate that high abundance of TIL-Bs and high density of direct  /CD8 T  interactions can predict patients with excellent prognosis, who would benefit from less invasive treatment. We propose that in extensively infiltrated tumors, TIL-Bs might recruit CD8 T cells via CXCL9 and due to a highly activated phenotype contribute by secondary costimulation to the maintenance of CD8 T cells in the tumor microenvironment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31371317>Lessons Learned from  Blockade Targeting PD-1 in Multiple Myeloma.</a></h2><p>  and agonists modulate ongoing, antigen-specific  responses.

We investigated two distinct strategies to modulate tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) to enhance cellular therapy targeting mesothelin in an autochthonous PDA mouse model. Administration of an antibody to colony-stimulating factor (anti-Csf1R) depleted Ly6C protumorigenic TAMs and significantly enhanced endogenous T- intratumoral accumulation. Despite increasing the number of endogenous T cells at the tumor site, as previously reported, TAM depletion had only minimal impact on intratumoral accumulation and persistence of T cells engineered to express a murine mesothelin-specific T- receptor (TCR). TAM depletion interfered with the antitumor activity of the infused T cells in PDA, evidenced by reduced tumor  apoptosis. In contrast, TAM programming with agonistic anti-CD40 increased both Ly6C TAMs and the intratumoral accumulation and longevity of TCR-engineered T cells. Anti-CD40 significantly increased the frequency and number of proliferating and granzyme  engineered T cells, and increased tumor  apoptosis. However, anti-CD40 failed to rescue intratumoral engineered T- IFNγ production. Thus, although functional modulation, rather than TAM depletion, enhanced the longevity of engineered T cells and increased tumor  apoptosis, ultimately, anti-CD40 modulation was insufficient to rescue key effector defects in tumor-reactive T cells. This study highlights critical distinctions between how endogenous T cells that evolve , and engineered T cells with previously acquired effector activity, respond to modifications of the tumor microenvironment.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628526>Antisense targeting of CD47 enhances human cytotoxic T- activity and increases survival of mice bearing B16 melanoma when combined with anti-CTLA4 and tumor irradiation.</a></h2><p>Antibodies targeting the T-   cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA4) enhance the effectiveness of radiotherapy for melanoma patients, but many remain resistant. To further improve response rates, we explored combining anti-CTLA4 blockade with antisense suppression of CD47, an inhibitory receptor on T cells that limit T- receptor signaling and killing of irradiated target cells. Human melanoma data from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed positive correlations between CD47 mRNA expression and expression of T- regulators including CTLA4 and its counter receptors CD80 and CD86. Antisense suppression of CD47 on human T cells in vitro using a translational blocking morpholino (CD47 m) alone or combined with anti-CTLA4 enhanced antigen-dependent killing of irradiated melanoma cells. Correspondingly, the treatment of locally irradiated B16F10 melanomas in C57BL/6 mice using combined blockade of CD47 and CTLA4 significantly increased the survival of mice relative to either treatment alone. CD47 m alone or in combination with anti-CTLA4 increased CD3 T- infiltration in irradiated tumors. Anti-CTLA4 also increased CD3 and CD8 T- infiltration as well as markers of NK cells in non-irradiated tumors. Anti-CTLA4 combined with CD47 m resulted in the greatest increase in intratumoral granzyme , interferon-γ, and NK- marker mRNA expression.

However, it remains unclear how metabolic processes regulate the generation of suppressive myeloid cells in the TME. Here, we found that hematopoietic precursor cells are enriched in the tissues of several types of human cancer and can differentiate into immature myeloid cells (IMC). Tumor-infiltrating IMCs are highly immunosuppressive, glycolytic, and proliferative, as indicated by high levels of M-CSFR, Glut1, and Ki67. To elucidate the role of metabolism in regulating the generation of IMCs, we induced suppressive IMCs from hematopoietic precursor cells with GM-CSF and G-CSF  We found that the generation of suppressive IMCs was accompanied by increased glycolysis, but not affected by glucose deprivation due to alternative catabolism. Generation of IMCs relied on glutaminolysis, regardless of glucose availability. Glutamine metabolism not only supported the expansion of IMCs with glutamine-derived α-ketoglutarate but also regulated the suppressive capacity through the glutamate-NMDA receptor axis. Moreover, inhibition of glutaminase GLS1 enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-L1 treatment, with reduced arginase 1 myeloid cells, increased CD8, IFNγ and granzyme  T cells, and delayed tumor growth in an ICB-resistant mouse model. Our work identified a novel regulatory mechanism of glutamine metabolism in controlling the generation of suppressive IMCs in the TME.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540435>Conceptual Development of Immunotherapeutic Approaches to Gastrointestinal Cancer.</a></h2><p>Gastrointestinal (GI) cancer is one of the common causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy are the current treatments, but some patients do not derive clinical benefits. Recently, studies from cancer molecular subtyping have revealed that tumor molecular biomarkers may predict the immunotherapeutic response of GI cancer patients. However, the therapeutic response of patients selected by the predictive biomarkers is suboptimal. The tumor -microenvironment apparently plays a key role in modulating these molecular-determinant predictive biomarkers. Therefore, an understanding of the development and recent advances in immunotherapeutic pharmacological intervention targeting tumor -microenvironments and their potential predictive biomarkers will be helpful to strengthen patient immunotherapeutic efficacy. The current review focuses on an understanding of how the host-microenvironment interactions and the predictive biomarkers can determine the efficacy of   inhibitors. The contribution of environmental pathogens and host immunity to GI cancer is summarized. A discussion regarding the clinical evidence of predictive biomarkers for clinical trial therapy design, current immunotherapeutic strategies, and the outcomes to GI cancer patients are highlighted.

Here, we examine whether anti-SLAMF3 affects both  and T  subsets during  responses to haptenated ovalbumin [NP-OVA] and in the setting of chronic graft vs. host disease (cGVHD) induced by transferring B6.C- /KhEg (bm12) CD4 T cells into B6 WT mice. We find that administering αSLAMF3 to NP-OVA immunized B6 mice primarily impairs antibody responses and Germinal center   [GC ] numbers, whilst CXCR5, PD-1, and ICOS T follicular helper (TFH) cells are not significantly affected. By contrast, administering αSLAMF3 markedly enhanced autoantibody production upon induction of cGVHD by the transfer of bm12 CD4 T cells into B6 recipients. Surprisingly, αSLAMF3 accelerated both the differentiation of GC  and donor-derived TFH cells initiated by cGVHD. The latter appeared to be induced by decreased numbers of donor-derived Treg and T follicular regulatory (TFR) cells. Collectively, these data show that control of anti-SLAMF3-induced signaling is requisite to prevent autoantibody responses during cGVHD, but reduces responses to foreign antigens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095438>Profiling Autoantibodies against Salivary Proteins in Sicca Conditions.</a></h2><p>Salivary gland dysfunction occurs in several autoimmune and -related conditions, including Sjögren syndrome (SS);   inhibitor-induced sicca (ICIS) that develops in some cancer patients and is characterized by severe, sudden-onset dry mouth; and autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED). Although subjects with these conditions present with oral dryness and often exhibit inflammatory infiltration of the salivary gland, little is known about the - humoral responses directed against salivary gland protein targets. In this study, autoantibodies were evaluated against Ro52, Ro60, and La, as well as against a panel of 22 proteins derived from the salivary proteome. The tested cohort included healthy volunteers and subjects with SS, ICIS, and APECED without and with sicca. As expected, a high percentage of autoantibody seropositivity was detected against Ro52, Ro60, and La in SS, but only a few ICIS patients were seropositive for these autoantigens. A few APECED subjects also harbored autoantibodies to Ro52 and La, but only Ro60 autoantibodies were weakly associated with a small subset of APECED patients with sicca. Additional testing of the salivary panel failed to detect seropositive autoantibodies against any of the salivary-enriched proteins in the SS and ICIS subjects. However, APECED subjects selectively demonstrated seropositivity against BPI fold containing family A member 1 (BPIFA1), BPI fold containing family A member 2 (BPIFA2)/parotid salivary protein (PSP), and lactoperoxidase, 3 salivary-enriched proteins. Moreover, high levels of serum autoantibodies against BPIFA1 and BPIFA2/PSP occurred in 30% and 67% of the APECED patients with sicca symptoms, respectively, and were associated with an earlier age onset of oral dryness ( = 0.001).

While focusing on ipilimumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab therapy, all available case reports as well as larger case series and clinical trials have been considered. Eighty-two case reports about -inhibitor therapy induced symptoms of the peripheral nervous system have been published, while only 43 case reports addressed central nervous system abnormalities. The frequency of  -inhibitor therapy inducing neurological adverse events is about 1% in larger studies. Especially neuromuscular adverse events exhibit distinct clinical and diagnostic characteristics. Additionally, several affected patients presented with overlap-syndromes, which means that symptoms and diagnostic findings indicating myositis, myasthenia gravis, and neuropathy were present in one individual patient at the same time.

However, unrestricted co-stimulation and/or inadequate co-inhibition may cause breakdown of self-tolerance, leading to autoimmunity. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex multi-organ disease with skewed and dysregulated  responses interacting with genetics and the environment. The close connections between co-signaling pathways and SLE have gradually been established in past research.

We examined whether this ligand is a prognostic marker for high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and whether it is associated with accumulation of  cells in the tumor. Serum s-CD95L levels in 51 patients with advanced ovarian cancer were tested by ELISA. IHC staining of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD163, CD31, FoxP3, CCR6, IL-17, Granzyme , PD-L1, and membrane CD95L was used to assess tumor-infiltrating  cells. Although the intensity of CD3, CD8, CD4, CD20, and CD163 in tumor tissues remained constant regardless of membrane CD95L expression, tumors in patients with HGSOC with s-CD95L levels ≥516 pg/mL showed increased infiltration by CD3 T cells ( = 0.001), comprising both cytotoxic CD8 ( = 0.01) and CD4 ( = 0.0062) cells including FoxP3 regulatory T cells ( = 0.0044). Also, the number of tumor-infiltrating CD20  cells ( = 0.0094) increased in these patients. Multivariate analyses revealed that low s-CD95L concentrations [<516 pg/mL, HR, 3.54; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13-11.11), and <1,200 activated CD8 (Granzyme ) cells (HR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.16-5.95) were independent poor prognostic factors for recurrence, whereas >6,000 CD3 cells (HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.15-0.79) was a good prognostic factor. Thus, low levels of s-CD95L (<516 pg/mL) are correlated with lower numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD3 and CD8, and also CD4 and FoxP3 T cells) in advanced HGSOC and are a poor prognostic marker.

In addition, we retrospectively analyzed 7 advanced ICC patients who were treated with PD1 inhibitor. : The cohort comprised 233 patients with HBV infection, 18 patients with hepatolithiasis, and 76 patients with undetermined risk factors. PD-L1 was mainly expressed in tumor cells, while CD3 and PD1 were expressed in infiltrating lymphocytes of tumor tissues. PD1/PD-L1 signals were activated in tumor tissues, and expression was positively correlated with HBV infection and lymph node invasion. More PD1 T cells and higher PD-L1 expression were observed in tumor tissues of ICC patients with HBV infection compared to patients with hepatolithiasis or undetermined risk factors. More PD1 T cells and/or high PD-L1 expression negatively impacted the prognosis of patients with HBV infection but not those with hepatolithiasis. Multivariate analysis showed PD1/PD-L1 expression was an independent indicator of ICC patient prognosis. Advanced ICC patients with HBV infection and less PD1 T cells tended to have good response to anti-PD1 therapy. : Hyperactivated PD1/PD-L1 signals in tumor tissues are a negative prognostic marker for ICCs after resection.

Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed an association between metformin use and OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.52; p = 0.04) as well as DSS (HR = 0.21; p = 0.04) but not recurrence-free survival (HR = 0.67; p = 0.33) in high-BMI patients only. In a separate cohort of 205 patients with tumors of all stages (including 35 metformin users), downregulation of   gene expression (programmed  death 1, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4,  and T lymphocyte associated, CD27 molecule, lymphocyte activating 3, and inducible T  costimulator) in metformin users was seen only in high-BMI patients, with upregulation of these genes seen in low-BMI patients with metformin use.Metformin use may be associated with better OS and DSS only in high-BMI patients. This hypothesis is supported by gene expression data of   genes in metformin users using a separate cohort of advanced-stage tumors.

The hydrogel vaccine also upregulated the production of IgG and the secretion of cytokines including IFN-γ, IL-4, and TNF-α. Importantly, the hydrogel-based combination therapy had superior immunotherapy effects against melanoma and 4T-1 tumor in comparison with the vaccine alone or in addition with a single   blockade. In studying the underlying mechanism, we found that the hydrogel-based combinatorial immunotherapy not only significantly increased the activated effector CD8 T cells within the spleens and tumors of vaccinated mice, but also reduced the ratio of Tregs. : Our findings indicate that the polypeptide hydrogel can be used as an effective sustained delivery platform for vaccines and   inhibitors, providing an advanced combinatorial immunotherapy approach for cancer treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31086813>Pharmacological inhibition of β-catenin/BCL9 interaction overcomes resistance to   blockades by modulating T cells.</a></h2><p>The Wnt/β-catenin (β-cat) pathway plays a critical role in cancer. Using hydrocarbon-stapled peptide technologies, we aim to develop potent, selective inhibitors targeting this pathway by disrupting the interaction of β-cat with its coactivators - lymphoma 9 (BCL9) and - lymphoma 9-like (B9L). We identified a set of peptides, including hsBCL9-24, that robustly inhibits the activity of β-cat and suppresses cancer  growth. In animal models, these peptides exhibit potent anti-tumor effects, favorable pharmacokinetic profiles, and minimal toxicities. Markedly, these peptides promote intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T cells by reducing regulatory T cells (T) and increasing dendritic cells (DCs), therefore sensitizing cancer cells to PD-1 inhibitors. Given the strong correlation between T infiltration and  mutation in colorectal cancers, it indicates our peptides can reactivate anti-cancer  response suppressed by the oncogenic Wnt pathway. In summary, we report a promising strategy for cancer therapy by pharmacological inhibition of the Wnt/β-cat signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665051>Immunotherapy in HER2-positive breast cancer: state of the art and future perspectives.</a></h2><p>Breast cancer (BC) is a complex disease with primary or acquired incurability characteristics in a significant part of patients. Immunotherapeutical agents represent an emerging option for breast cancer treatment, including the human epidermal growth factor 2 positive (HER2+) subtype. The  system holds the ability to spontaneously implement a defensive response against HER2+ BC cells through complex mechanisms which can be exploited to modulate this response for obtaining a clinical benefit. Initial  system modulating strategies consisted mostly in vaccine therapies, which are still being investigated and improved. However, the entrance of trastuzumab into the scenery of HER2+ BC treatment was the real game changing event, which embodied a dominant -mediated mechanism. More recently, the advent of the   inhibitors has caused a new paradigm shift for immuno-oncology, with promising initial results also for HER2+ BC. Breast cancer has been traditionally considered poorly immunogenic, being characterized by relatively low tumor mutation burden (TMB). Nevertheless, recent evidence has revealed high tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and programmed  death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in a considerable proportion of HER2+ BC patients. This may translate into a higher potential to elicit anti-cancer response and, therefore, wider possibilities for the use and implementation of immunotherapy in this subset of BC patients. We are herein presenting and critically discussing the most representative evidence concerning immunotherapy in HER2+ BC cancer, both singularly and in combination with therapeutic agents acting throughout HER2-block,   inhibition and anti-cancer vaccines. The reader will be also provided with hints concerning potential future projection of the most promising immutherapeutic agents and approaches for the disease of interest.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31360876>Mismatch Repair Protein Loss as a Prognostic and Predictive Biomarker in Breast Cancers Regardless of Microsatellite Instability.</a></h2><p>Breast cancers that harbor mismatch-repair (MMR) deficiency and/or microsatellite instability (MSI) might be sensitive to   blockade, but there are currently no specific guidelines for assessing MMR status in breast cancer. Here, we sought to define the clinical value of MMR immunohistochemistry (IHC) and MSI analysis in breast cancers.We subjected 444 breast cancers to MMR IHC and MSI analysis. Cases were classified as MMR-proficient (pMMR), MMR-deficient (dMMR), and MMR-heterogeneous (hMMR) based on the loss of immunoreactivity; MSI was defined by instability in the five indicators recommended by the National Cancer Institute for endometrial and colorectal cancers. Correlation of MMR status with patients' survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Statistical tests were two-sided.Loss of MMR proteins was homogeneous (dMMR) in 75 patients (17%) and heterogeneous (hMMR) in 55 (12%). Among luminal breast cancers, there were similar frequencies of dMMR and hMMR tumors. Overall, the rate of discrepancy between IHC and MSI analysis was high (91%). Women with Luminal -like dMMR carcinomas (n = 44) showed shorter overall survival (median = 77 months, range = 0-115 months) than those with pMMR (n = 205) or hMMR (n = 35) tumors (median = 84 months, range = 0-127 months) ( = .008). On the contrary, patients with estrogen receptor-negative breast cancers treated with chemotherapy lived longer in cases of dMMR (n = 9) than pMMR (n = 33) or hMMR (n = 7) tumors, with 87 months of median survival (range = 73-123 months) for the former compared with 79 months (range = 8-113 months) for the latter two categories ( < .001).Immunohistochemistry and MSI are not interchangeable tests in breast carcinomas. MMR protein loss is a more common event than MSI and shows intra-tumor heterogeneity. MMR IHC allows the identification of clinically relevant subclasses of breast cancer patients, provided that multiple areas of the tumor are analyzed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31291131>LAG-3 antagonists by cancer treatment: a patent review.</a></h2><p>: LAG-3 is  inhibitor in cancer that coordinates the downregulation of the proliferation of antigen-specific lymphocytes. There is a great need to discover and develop new therapies focused on inhibiting the action of LAG-3 and consequently improving the  response in the various types of cancer. : The patent literature reveals novel therapies, which provide information on cancer therapies.

Until recently, beclin-1 was a protein known mainly for its role as a critical regulator of autophagy. In this issue of the JCI, Tan et al. describe the effects of the beclin-1 conditional myeloid -specific deletion in mice, in which immunostimulation resulted in hypersensitive neutrophils. The chronic proinflammatory effect of these neutrophils triggered spontaneous   malignancies to develop. Such tumorigenic effects were mediated primarily by IL-21 and CD40 signaling, leading to the upregulation of tolerogenic molecules, such as IL-10 and PD-L1. The authors went on to examine samples derived from patient lymphoid malignancies and showed that beclin-1 expression in neutrophils positively correlated with pre-  leukemia/lymphoma. Overall, the study provides an elegant model for neutrophil-driven carcinogenesis and identifies potential targets for immunotherapy of   malignancies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645354>Cooperative -mediated Mechanisms of the HDAC Inhibitor Entinostat, an IL-15 Superagonist, and a Cancer Vaccine Effectively Synergize as a Novel Cancer Therapy.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy has demonstrated clinical efficacy in subsets of patients with solid carcinomas. Multimodal therapies employing agents that can affect different arms of the  system and/or tumor microenvironment might increase clinical responses.We demonstrate that entinostat, a class I histone deacetylase inhibitor, enhances the anti-tumor efficacy of the IL-15 superagonist, N-803 plus vaccine in 4T1 triple-negative breast and MC38-CEA colon murine carcinoma models. A comprehensive  and gene expression analysis was performed in the periphery and/or tumor microenvironment (TME) of MC38-CEA tumor-bearing mice.Although N-803 plus vaccine induced peripheral CD8 T  activation and cytokine production, there was no reduction in tumor burden and poor tumor infiltration of CD8 T cells with minimal levels of granzyme . For the first time, we demonstrate that the addition of entinostat to N-803 plus vaccine promoted significant tumor control, correlating with increased expression of genes associated with tumor inflammation, enhanced infiltration of activated CD8 T cells with maximal granzyme , T- responses to multiple tumor-associated antigens, increased serum IFNg, reduction of regulatory T cells in the TME, and decreased expression of the  V-domain Ig Suppressor of T  Activation (VISTA) on multiple  subsets.Collectively, these data demonstrate that the synergistic combination of entinostat, N-803, and vaccine elicits potent anti-tumor activity by generating a more inflamed TME. These findings thus form the rationale for the use of this combination of agents for patients harboring poorly or non-inflamed solid carcinomas.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31171876>Atezolizumab plus cobimetinib and vemurafenib in BRAF-mutated melanoma patients.</a></h2><p>Melanoma treatment has progressed in the past decade with the development and approval of   inhibitors targeting programmed death 1 (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4, as well as small molecule inhibitors of BRAF and/or MEK for the subgroup of patients with BRAF mutations. BRAF/MEK-targeted therapies have effects on the tumor microenvironment that support their combination with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. This phase Ib study (ClinicalTrials.gov, number  ) evaluated the safety and anti-tumor activity of combining atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) with vemurafenib (BRAF inhibitor), or cobimetinib (MEK inhibitor) + vemurafenib, in patients with BRAF-mutated metastatic melanoma. Triple combination therapy with atezolizumab + cobimetinib + vemurafenib, after a 28-d run-in period with cobimetinib + vemurafenib, had substantial but manageable toxicity. Exploratory biomarker data show that the cobimetinib + vemurafenib run-in was associated with an increase in proliferating CD4 T-helper cells but not with an increase in T-regulatory cells, as observed in the vemurafenib-only run-in period. The confirmed objective response rate was 71.8% (95% confidence interval 55.1-85.0). The estimated median duration of response was 17.4 months (95% confidence interval 10.6-25.3) with ongoing response in 39.3% of patients after 29.9 months of follow-up.

Current theories on regulation of inflammation center on anti-tumor T  responses. Here we show that tumor associated  cells are vital to melanoma associated inflammation. Human  cells express pro- and anti-inflammatory factors and differentiate into plasmablast-like cells when exposed to autologous melanoma secretomes in vitro. This plasmablast-like phenotype can be reconciled in human melanomas where plasmablast-like cells also express T -recruiting chemokines CCL3, CCL4, CCL5. Depletion of  cells in melanoma patients by anti-CD20 immunotherapy decreases tumor associated inflammation and CD8 T  numbers. Plasmablast-like cells also increase PD-1 T  activation through anti-PD-1 blockade in vitro and their frequency in pretherapy melanomas predicts response and survival to   blockade. Tumor associated  cells therefore orchestrate and sustain melanoma inflammation and may represent a predictor for survival and response to   blockade therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31079556>Upper gastrointestinal symptoms and associated endoscopic and histological features in patients receiving   inhibitors.</a></h2><p>   inhibitors (ICIs) have demonstrated effectiveness in treating many malignancies. Gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events are commonly reported; however, few reports describe upper GI tract toxic effects. We aimed to describe clinical features of upper GI injury related to ICI.  We studied consecutive patients who received ICIs between April 2011 and March 2018 and developed upper GI symptoms requiring esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).  Sixty patients developed upper GI symptoms between ICI initiation and 6 months after the last infusion. Among patients who had both EGD and colonoscopy ( = 38), 21 had endoscopic evidence of inflammation involving both the upper and lower GI tract. Overall, histological signs of inflammation of the stomach were evident in 83% of patients, but inflammation of the duodenum in 38%. Total of 42 patients had other risk factors of gastritis, i.e., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Only isolated gastric inflammation was seen on endoscopy in patients without these risk factors. The rates of ulceration were similar in the cohorts with and without other risk factors for gastritis. Isolated upper GI inflammation was related to anti-PD-1/L1 in 47% of patients. Immunosuppressive therapy in our cohort with upper GI toxicity consisted of steroids (42%) and infliximab or vedolizumab (23%). Most isolated upper GI symptoms were treated with proton pump inhibitors (65%) or H blockers (35%).  We observed a correlation between ICI use and onset of upper GI inflammation even when other risk factors were excluded. Gastric involvement was evident more often than duodenal involvement on endoscopic and histological level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31471921>Clinicopathological evidence of hepatitis  virus infection in the development of gastric adenocarcinoma.</a></h2><p>Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the infection-related cancers. Helicobacter pylori and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were established risk factors for GC. Recently, there are several reports showing the inconsistent association between hepatitis  virus (HBV) infection and the development of GC. To explore the relationship between HBV infection and the development of GC, we designed a meta-analysis of previous epidemiological studies, a hospital-based case-control study, followed by an immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay of HBV-exposed GC samples. We found that HBV infection was associated with an increased risk of GC based on the meta-analysis. No significant association between HBV infection and GC was detected according to our hospital-based case-control study. Histological examination showed that the gastric epithelium positive for HBx demonstrated a higher nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio compared to those HBx-negative cells. HBx and HBcAg were expressed more in tumors than those in normal counterparts in HBV-exposed subjects, and PD-L1 was lower in GC tissues from HBV carriers than those in HBV clearances. In conclusion, HBV infection may contribute to a higher risk for GC based on the meta-analysis and to the morphological atypia of gastric epithelium by the histological assessment, and GC patients among HBV carriers showed lower expression of PD-L1 may lose the chance for   blockade therapy.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31079803>Future Research Goals in Immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>In our opinion the most urgent needs to improve patient outcomes are: 1) a deeper ability to measure cancer immunobiology, and 2) increased availability of agents that, coupled with predictive biomarkers, will be used to tailor anti-cancer immunity. Tailoring effective immunotherapy will entail combinations of immunotherapeutics that augment priming of anti-cancer immunity, boost expansion of effector and memory cells of the T,  and NK lineage, amplify innate immunity and relieve  inhibition.

Here, we sought peripheral blood T- biomarker candidates predicting treatment outcome in 75 stage IV melanoma patients treated with anti-PD-1 antibodies. We investigated associations with clinical response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Univariate analysis of potential biological confounders and known biomarkers, and a multivariate model, was used to determine statistical independence of associations between candidate biomarkers and clinical outcomes. We found that a lower than median frequency of peripheral PD-1+CD56+ T-cells was associated with longer OS (p = 0.004), PFS (p = 0.041) and superior clinical benefit (p = 0.009). However, neither frequencies of CD56-CD4+ nor CD56-CD8+ T-cells, nor of the PD-1+ fraction within the CD4 or CD8 subsets was associated with clinical outcome. In a multivariate model with known confounders and biomarkers only the M-category (HR, 3.11; p = 0.007) and the frequency of PD-1+CD56+ T-cells (HR, 2.39; p = 0.028) were identified as independent predictive factors for clinical outcome under PD-1 blockade. Thus, a lower than median frequency of peripheral blood PD-1+CD56+ T-cells prior to starting anti-PD-1  blockade is associated with superior clinical response, longer PFS and OS of stage IV melanoma patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646089>Dexamethasone differentially depletes tumour and peripheral blood lymphocytes and can impact the efficacy of chemotherapy/ blockade combination treatment.</a></h2><p>Dexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid commonly used for the prevention and management of side effects in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. While it is effective as an anti-emetic and in preventing hypersensitivity reactions, dexamethasone depletes peripheral blood lymphocytes and impacts  responses. The effect of dexamethasone on the number and quality of tumour-infiltrating leukocytes has not been reported. To address this, we calibrated the dose in two different strains of mice to achieve the same extent of peripheral blood lymphocyte depletion observed in patients with cancer. Doses that caused analogous depletion of T and  lymphocytes and NK cells from the peripheral blood, elicited no change in these populations within the tumour. The expression of   molecules PD-1, OX40, GITR and TIM3 on tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes was not altered. We found that dexamethasone had a small but significant deleterious impact on weakly efficacious chemoimmunotherapy but had no effect when the protocol was highly efficacious. Based on these results, we predict that dexamethasone will have a modest negative influence on the overall effectiveness of chemoimmunotherapy treatment.© 2019 The Author(s).

Poor DC development can limit the efficacy of   blockade and  vaccination approaches. Interference in intracellular signaling cascades downstream from the receptors of major tumor-associated suppressive cytokines like IL-10 and IL-6, might improve DC development and activation, and thus enhance immunotherapy efficacy. We performed exploratory functional screens on arrays consisting of >1000 human kinase peptide substrates to identify pathways involved in DC development and its inhibition by IL-10 or IL-6. The resulting alterations in phosphorylation of the kinome substrate profile pointed to glycogen-synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) as a pivotal kinase in both DC development and suppression. GSK3β inhibition blocked human DC differentiation , which was accompanied by decreased levels of IL-12p70 secretion, and a reduced capacity for T  priming. More importantly, adenoviral transduction of monocytes with a constitutively active form of GSK3β induced resistance to the suppressive effects of IL-10 and melanoma-derived supernatants alike, resulting in improved DC development, accompanied by up-regulation of co-stimulatory markers, an increase in CD83 expression levels in mature DC, and diminished release of IL-10. Moreover, adenovirus-mediated intratumoral manipulation of this pathway in an  melanoma model resulted in DC activation and recruitment, and in improved  surveillance and tumor control. We propose the induction of constitutive GSK3β activity as a novel therapeutic means to bolster DC functionality in the tumor microenvironment.© 2019 The Author(s).

Despite this opportunity, identification of protein-protein interfaces remains challenging. We have previously developed a method that relies on coating protein surfaces with small-molecule dyes to discriminate between solvent-accessible protein surfaces and hidden interface regions. Dye-bound, solvent-accessible protein regions resist trypsin digestion, whereas hidden interface regions are revealed by denaturation and sequenced by MS. The small-molecule dyes bind promiscuously and with high affinity, but their binding mechanism is unknown. Here, we report on the optimization of a novel dye probe used in protein painting, Fast Blue  + naphthionic acid, and show that its affinity for proteins strongly depends on hydrophobic moieties that we call here "hydrophobic clamps." We demonstrate the utility of this probe by sequencing the protein-protein interaction regions between the Hippo pathway protein Yes-associated protein 2 (YAP2) and tight junction protein 1 (TJP1 or ZO-1), uncovering interactions via the known binding domain as well as ZO-1's MAGUK domain and YAP's N-terminal proline-rich domain. Additionally, we demonstrate how residues predicted by protein painting are present exclusively in the complex interface and how these residues may guide the development of peptide inhibitors using a case study of programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed  death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1).

Whereas a few microbial pathogens exploit these "holes" in the   repertoire by mimicking host antigens to evade  surveillance, the extent to which tolerance reduces the   repertoire to foreign antigens is unknown. Here, we use single- cultures to determine the repertoires of human   antigen receptors (BCRs) before (transitional  cells) and after (mature  cells) the second   tolerance  in both healthy donors and in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) . In healthy donors, the majority (~70%) of transitional  cells that recognize foreign antigens also bind human self-antigens (foreign+self), and peripheral tolerance halves the frequency of foreign+self-reactive mature  cells. In contrast, in SLE patients who are defective in the second tolerance , frequencies of foreign+self-reactive  cells remain unchanged during maturation of transitional to mature  cells. Patterns of foreign+self-reactivity among mature  cells from healthy donors differ from those of SLE patients.

Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells are crucial for the rejection of established tumors. We constructed XCL1-GPC3 fusion molecules as a liver cancer vaccine by linking the XCL1 chemokine to glypican-3 (GPC3), which is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cells expressing XCL1-GPC3 chemoattracted murine XCR1+CD8α+DCs and human XCR1+CD141+DCs in vitro and promoted their IL-12 production. After subcutaneous mXcl1-GPC3 plasmid injection, mXCL1-GPC3 was mainly detected in CD8α+DCs of mouse draining lymph nodes. XCL1-GPC3-targeted DCs enhanced antigen-specific CD8+ T -proliferation and induced the de novo generation of GPC3-specific CD8+ T cells, which abolished GPC3-expressing tumor cells in mouse and human systems. We immunized a murine autochthonous liver cancer model, with a hepatitis  background, with the mXcl1-GPC3 plasmid starting six weeks, when malignant hepatocyte clusters formed, or 14 weeks, when liver tumor nodules developed, after diethylnitrosamine administration. mXcl1-GPC3 immunized mice displayed significantly inhibited tumor formation and growth compared to GPC3-immunized mice. After mXcl1-GPC3 immunization, mouse livers showed elevated production of IFNγ, granzyme , IL-18, CCL5, CXCL19, Xcl1, and increased infiltration of GPC3-specific CD8+ T cells, activated NK cells and NKT cells. The antitumor effects of these  cells were further enhanced by the administration of anti-PD1. Anti-HCC effects induced by hXCL1-GPC3 were confirmed in HCC-PDX model from three patients. Thus, XCL1-GPC3 might be a promising cancer vaccine to compensate for the deficiency of the  blockades in HCC immunotherapy.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31327293>A Multidisciplinary Evaluation of Barriers to Enrolling Cancer Patients into Early Phase Clinical Trials: Challenges and Patient-centric Recommendations.</a></h2><p>: Early phase clinical trials are the first clinical research step to bringing new cancer therapeutics to patients.

However, the majority of patients treated with these drugs do not experience any clinical benefit. Because not all patients benefit from ICIs, and some may experience more meaningful tumor response if treated with chemotherapy or other treatments, there is a compelling need for predictive biomarkers to facilitate more informed selection of therapy. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) is one feature of a tumor that has predictive value for ICI therapy across multiple cancer types. In a pan-cancer analysis of over 1,600 patients, higher TMB was associated with longer survival and higher response rates with ICI therapy. While this effect was seen in the majority of cancer types, indicating that TMB underlies fundamental aspects of -mediated tumor rejection, the optimal predictive cut-point varied widely by histology, suggesting that there is unlikely to be one tissue-agnostic definition of high TMB that is useful for predicting ICI response. More comprehensive predictive models integrating TMB with other factors - including genetic, immunologic, and clinicopathologic markers - will be needed to potentially achieve a tissue-agnostic predictor of benefit from ICIs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31222843>The  response-related mutational signatures and driver genes in non-small- lung cancer.</a></h2><p>  blockade (ICB) therapy has achieved remarkable clinical benefit in non-small- lung cancer (NSCLC), but our understanding of biomarkers that predict the response to ICB remain obscure. Here we integrated somatic mutational profile and clinicopathologic information from 113 NSCLC patients treated by ICB (CTLA-4/PD-1). High tumor mutation burden (TMB) and neoantigen burden were identified significantly associated with improved efficacy in NSCLC immunotherapy. Furthermore, we identified apolipoprotein  mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) mutational signature was markedly associated with responding of ICB therapy (log-rank test, P = .001; odds ratio (OR), 0.18 [95% CI, 0.06-0.50], P < .001). The association with progression-free survival remained statistically significant after controlling for age, sex, histological type, smoking, PD-L1 expression, hypermutation, smoking signature and mismatch repair (MMR) (HR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.12-0.75], P = .010). Combined high TMB with APOBEC signature preferably predict immunotherapy responders in NSCLC cohort. The CIBERSORT algorithm revealed that high APOBEC mutational activity samples were associated with increased infiltration of CD4 memory activated T cells, CD8 T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, but reduced infiltration of regulatory T cells. Besides, individual genes mutation of IFNGR1 or VTCN1 were only found in responders; however, the PTEN mutation was only found in non-responders (Fisher's exact test, all P < .05). These findings may be applicable for guiding immunotherapy for patients with NSCLC.© 2019 The Authors.

In this retrospective study, we investigated PD-L1 and PD1 expression in all PTLD categories of childhood and adolescence to see whether  inhibition with PD-L1/PD1 inhibitors may serve as a therapy option. We included 21 patients aged 19 years or younger (at date of transplant) with PTLD following SOT or HSCT having adequate tumor samples available (n = 29). Using immunohistochemistry, we evaluated PD-L1/PD1 expression on both tumor cells and cells of the microenvironment in all samples. Availability of consecutively matched tumor samples during 6 of 21 patients' disease courses also allowed an intra-individual assessment of PD-L1/PD1 expression. We observed lower PD-L1 and higher PD1 expression in non-destructive lesions, and higher PD-L1 and lower PD1 expression in polymorphic and, in particular, in monomorphic PTLD, mostly diffuse large - lymphomas (DLBCL, n = 10/21). The amount of PD-L1- and PD1-positive cells changed in the opposite way in sequential biopsies of the same individual correlating well with the PTLD category. This is the first comprehensive pediatric study assessing PD-L1 and PD1 expression on tumor cells and in the microenvironment of PTLD including not only monomorphic, but also non-destructive early lesions. PD-L1 expression of the tumor cells inversely correlated with PD1 expression in surrounding tissues, with the highest expression in DLBCL. Since PTLD can be therapeutically challenging, our results indicate a potential efficacy of  inhibitors if standard - and/or chemotherapy fail or are impossible. We therefore recommend routine staining of PD-L1 and PD1 in all PTLD categories.© 2019 The Authors.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) for targeted therapy in hematology. This review focuses on the efficacy results of the currently available targeted agents and recaps the main ongoing trials in the setting of mature - non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The objective is to summarize the different classes of novel agents approved for mature - lymphomas, to describe in synoptic tables the results they achieved and, finally, to draw future scenarios as we glimpse through the ongoing clinical trials. Characteristics and therapeutic efficacy are summarized for the currently approved mAbs [i.e., anti-Cluster of differentiation (CD) mAbs,   inhibitors, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T- therapy, and bispecific antibodies] as well as for SMIs i.e., inhibitors of - receptor signaling, proteasome, mTOR BCL-2 HDAC pathways. The biological disease profiling of - lymphoma subtypes may foster the discovery of innovative drug strategies for improving survival outcome in lymphoid neoplasms, as well as the trade-offs between efficacy and toxicity. The hope for clinical advantages should carefully be coupled with mindful awareness of the potential pitfalls and the occurrence of uneven, sometimes severe, toxicities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31114583>Staphylococcal and Streptococcal Superantigens Trigger B7/CD28 Costimulatory Receptor Engagement to Hyperinduce Inflammatory Cytokines.</a></h2><p>Staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens are virulence factors that cause toxic shock by hyperinducing inflammatory cytokines. Effective T- activation requires interaction between the principal costimulatory receptor CD28 and its two coligands, B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86). To elicit an inflammatory cytokine storm, bacterial superantigens must bind directly into the homodimer interfaces of CD28 and B7-2. Recent evidence revealed that by engaging CD28 and B7-2 directly at their dimer interface, staphylococcal enterotoxin  (SEB) potently enhances intercellular synapse formation mediated by B7-2 and CD28, resulting in T- hyperactivation. Here, we addressed the question, whether diverse bacterial superantigens share the property of triggering B7-2/CD28 receptor engagement and if so, whether they are capable of enhancing also the interaction between B7-1 and CD28, which occurs with an order-of-magnitude higher affinity. To this end, we compared the ability of distinct staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens to enhance intercellular B7-2/CD28 engagement. Each of these diverse superantigens promoted B7-2/CD28 engagement to a comparable extent. Moreover, they were capable of triggering the intercellular B7-1/CD28 interaction, analyzed by flow cytometry of co-cultured  populations transfected separately to express human CD28 or B7-1. Streptococcal mitogenic exotoxin Z (SMEZ), the most potent superantigen known, was as sensitive as SEB, SEA and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) to inhibition of inflammatory cytokine induction by CD28 and B7-2 dimer interface mimetic peptides. Thus, superantigens act not only by mediating unconventional interaction between MHC-II molecule and T- receptor but especially, by strongly promoting engagement of CD28 by its B7-2 and B7-1 coligands, a critical  , forcing the principal costimulatory axis to signal excessively. Our results show that the diverse superantigens use a common mechanism to subvert the inflammatory response, strongly enhancing B7-1/CD28 and B7-2/CD28 costimulatory receptor engagement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31335250>Immunotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia: from allogeneic stem  transplant to novel therapeutics.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy in the form of allogeneic stem  transplantation (SCT) plays an instrumental role in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with non-transplant modalities of immunotherapy including  blockade now being actively explored.

Recommendations are graded in three categories (A,  and C), according to the level of evidence found in the literature, up until December 2018.The management of metastatic colorectal cancer has become complex because of increasing available medical, radiological and surgical treatments alone or in combination. The therapeutic strategy should be defined before the first-line treatment, mostly depending on the presentation of the disease (resectability of the metastases, symptomatic and/or threatening disease), of the patient's condition (ECOG PS, comorbidities), and tumor biology (RAS, BRAF, MSI). The sequence of targeted therapies also seems to have an impact on the outcome (angiogenesis inhibition beyond progression). Surgical resection of metastases was the only curative intent treatment to date, joined recently by percutaneous tumor ablation tools (radiofrequency, microwave). Localized therapies such as hepatic intra-arterial infusion, radioembolization and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, also have seen their indications specified (liver-dominant disease and resectable peritoneal carcinomatosis). New treatments have been developed in heavily pretreated patients, increasing overall survival and preserving quality of life (regorafenib and trifluridine/tipiracil). Finally,   inhibitors have demonstrated high efficacy in MSI mCRC.French guidelines for mCRC management are put together to help offer the best personalized therapeutic strategy in daily clinical practice, as the mCRC therapeutic landscape is complexifying.

H. pylori is able to produce a persistent infection due in large part to its ability to hijack the host  response. The host adaptive  response is activated to strategically and specifically attack pathogens and normally clears them from the infected host. Since  and T lymphocytes are central mediators of adaptive immunity, in this chapter we review their development and the fundamental mechanisms regulating their activation in order to understand how some of the normal processes are subverted by H. pylori. In this review, we place particular emphasis on the CD4 T  responses, their subtypes, and regulatory mechanisms because of the expanding literature in this area related to H. pylori. T lymphocyte differentiation and function are finely orchestrated through a series of - interactions, which include   receptors. Among the   receptor family, there are some with inhibitory properties that are exploited by tumor cells to facilitate their  evasion. Gastric epithelial cells (GECs), which act as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the gastric mucosa, are induced by H. pylori to express   receptors known to sway T lymphocyte function and thus circumvent effective T effector lymphocyte responses. This chapter reviews these and other mechanisms used by H. pylori to interfere with host immunity in order to persist.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615809>Targeting Semaphorin 4D in Cancer: A Look from Different Perspectives.</a></h2><p>Semaphorin 4D (Sema4D) plays a role in various  types including  lymphocytes, differentiating neurons, endothelial cells, and cancer cells.

Although high-dose chemotherapy remains the standard of care at first relapse for sufficiently young and fit patients, fewer than one-quarter of patients with relapsed/refractory disease are cured with this approach. Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have emerged as an effective therapy in patients with multiple relapsed/refractory disease, capable of inducing durable remissions in patients with chemotherapy-refractory disease. Three anti-CD19 CAR T cells for aggressive - lymphoma (axicabtagene ciloleucel, tisagenlecleucel, and lisocabtagene ciloleucel) are either U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved or in late-stage development. All three CAR T cells produce durable remissions in 33%-40% of treated patients. Differences among these products include the specific CAR constructs, costimulatory domains, manufacturing process, dose, and eligibility criteria for their pivotal trials. Notable toxicities include cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicities, which are usually treatable and reversible, as well as cytopenias and hypogammaglobulinemia. Incidences of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity differ across CAR T- products, related in part to the type of costimulatory domain. Potential mechanisms of resistance include CAR T- exhaustion and  evasion, CD19 antigen loss, and a lack of persistence. Rational combination strategies with CAR T cells are under evaluation, including   inhibitors, immunomodulators, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Novel  products are also being developed and include CAR T cells that target multiple tumor antigens, cytokine-secreting CAR T cells, and gene-edited CAR T cells, among others.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187301>Alleviation of exhaustion-induced immunosuppression and sepsis by   blockers sequentially administered with antibiotics-analysis of a new mathematical model.</a></h2><p>Sepsis-associated  dysregulation, involving hyper-inflammation and immunosuppression, is common in intensive care patients, often leading to multiple organ dysfunction and death. The aim of this study was to identify the main driving force underlying immunosuppression in sepsis, and to suggest new therapeutic avenues for controlling this  impairment and alleviating excessive pathogen load.We developed two minimalistic (skeletal) mathematical models of pathogen-associated inflammation, which focus on the dynamics of myeloid, lymphocyte, and pathogen numbers in blood. Both models rely on the assumption that the presence of the pathogen causes a bias in hematopoietic stem  differentiation toward the myeloid developmental line. Also in one of the models, we assumed that continuous exposure to pathogens induces lymphocyte exhaustion. In addition, we also created therapy models, both by antibiotics and by immunotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1  inhibitors. Assuming realistic parameter ranges, we simulated the pathogen-associated inflammation models in silico with or without various antibiotic and immunotherapy schedules.Computer simulations of the two models show that the assumption of lymphocyte exhaustion is a prerequisite for attaining sepsis-associated immunosuppression, and that the ability of the innate and adaptive  systems to control infections depends on the pathogen's replication rate. Simulation results further show that combining antibiotics with   blockers can suffice for defeating even an aggressive pathogen within a relatively short period. This is so as long as the drugs are administered soon after diagnosis. In contrast, when applied as monotherapies, antibiotics or   blockers fall short of eliminating aggressive pathogens in reasonable time.Our results suggest that lymphocyte exhaustion crucially drives immunosuppression in sepsis, and that one can efficiently resolve both immunosuppression and pathogenesis by timely coupling of antibiotics with an   blocker, but not by either one of these two treatment modalities alone. Following experimental validation, our model can be adapted to explore the potential of other therapeutic options in this field.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31139410>Clinical chimeric antigen receptor-T  therapy: a new and promising treatment modality for glioblastoma.</a></h2><p>Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T  therapy is now approved in the United States and Europe as a standard treatment for relapsed/refractory - malignancies. It has also been approved recently by the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia and may soon be publicly reimbursed. This advance has accentuated scientific, clinical and commercial interest in adapting this exciting technology for the treatment of solid cancers where it is widely recognised that the challenges of overcoming a hostile tumor microenvironment are most acute. Indeed, CAR-T  technology may be of the greatest value for those cancers that lack pre-existing immunity because they are immunologically 'cold', or have a low somatic tumor mutation load, or both. These cancers are generally not amenable to therapeutic   blockade, but CAR-T  therapy may be effective because it provides an abundant supply of autologous tumor-specific T cells. This is achieved by using genetic engineering to re-direct autologous T- cytotoxicity towards a tumor-associated antigen, bypassing endogenous T- requirements for antigen processing, MHC-dependent antigen presentation and co-stimulation. One of the most challenging solid cancers is glioblastoma, which has among the least permissive immunological milieu of any cancer, and which is almost always fatal. Here, we argue that CAR-T  technology may counter some glioblastoma defences and provide a beachhead for furthering our eventual therapeutic aims of restoring effective antitumor immunity. Although clinical investigation of CAR-T  therapy for glioblastoma is at an early stage, we discuss three recently published studies, which feature significant differences in target antigen, CAR-T  phenotype, route of administration and tumor response.

Most patients were treated with anti-PD-1 or anti PD L1 as monotherapy (79%) or in combination with CTLA-4 blockade (15%). On average, diabetes mellitus was diagnosed after 4.5 cycles; earlier for combination ICI at 2.7 cycles. Early-onset diabetes mellitus (after 1 or 2 cycles) was observed during all treatment regimens. Diabetic ketoacidosis was present in 71%, while elevated lipase levels were detected in 52% (13/25). Islet autoantibodies were positive in 53% of patients with a predominance of glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies. Susceptible HLA genotypes were present in 65% (mostly DR4).

The median progression-free survival was similar in the PD-1 and ipilimumab plus nivolumab group (2.6 months [95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.0-3.1] vs. 2.0 [95% CI, 1.4-2.6], p = 0.15). The objective response rate was 18.0% in the PD-1 and 15.0% in the ipilimumab plus nivolumab group (p = 0.70). The disease control rate was 25.7% for monotherapy and 18.3% for combined ICB (p = 0.39).

The latter was associated with a higher rate of treatment-related adverse events (AEs). No significant association of laboratory values or clinicopathological characteristics with response to second-line ICB was observed.PD-1 monotherapy and combined ipilimumab plus nivolumab show similar activity and outcome in patients with melanoma resistant to BRAF + MEK inhibition.

This disease is characterized by progressive ataxia, telangiectasia,  deficiency, predisposition to malignancies, and radiosensitivity. However, hypomorphic variants may be discovered associated with very atypical phenotypes, raising the importance of evaluating their pathogenic effects. In this study, multiple functional analyses were performed on lymphoblastoid  lines from 36 patients, comprising 49 ATM variants, 24 being of uncertain significance. Thirteen patients with atypical phenotype and presumably hypomorphic variants were of particular interest to test strength of functional analyses and to highlight discrepancies with typical patients. Western-blot combined with transcript analyses allowed the identification of one missing variant, confirmed suspected splice defects and revealed unsuspected minor transcripts. Subcellular localization analyses confirmed the low level and abnormal cytoplasmic localization of ATM for most A-T  lines. Interestingly, atypical patients had lower kinase defect and less altered - distribution after genotoxic stress than typical patients. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the pathogenic effects of the 49 variants, highlighted the strength of KAP1 phosphorylation test for pathogenicity assessment and allowed the establishment of the Ataxia-TeLangiectasia Atypical Score to predict atypical phenotype.

Unlike CD47, which is expressed ubiquitously, SIRPα expression is mainly restricted to myeloid cells and neurons. Therefore, compared to CD47-targeted therapies, targeting SIRPα may result in differential safety and efficacy profiles, potentially enabling lower effective doses and improved pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The development of effective SIRPα antagonists is restricted by polymorphisms within the CD47-binding domain of SIRPα, necessitating pan-allele reactive anti-SIRPα antibodies for therapeutic intervention in diverse patient populations. We immunized wild-type and human antibody transgenic chickens with a multi-allele and multi-species SIRPα regimen in order to discover pan-allelic and pan-mammalian reactive anti-SIRPα antibodies suitable for clinical translation. A total of 200 antibodies were isolated and screened for SIRPα reactivity from which approximately 70 antibodies with diverse SIRPα binding profiles, sequence families, and epitopes were selected for further characterization. A subset of anti-SIRPα antibodies bound to both human SIRPα v1 and v2 alleles with high affinity ranging from low nanomolar to picomolar, potently antagonized the CD47/SIRPα interaction, and potentiated macrophage-mediated antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis . X-ray crystal structures of five anti-SIRPα antigen-binding fragments, each with unique epitopes, in complex with SIRPα (PDB codes 6NMV, 6NMU, 6NMT, 6NMS, and 6NMR) are reported. Furthermore, some of the anti-SIRPα antibodies cross-react with cynomolgus SIRPα and various mouse SIRPα alleles (BALB/c, NOD, BL/6), which can facilitate preclinical to clinical development. These properties provide an attractive rationale to advance the development of these anti-SIRPα antibodies as a novel therapy for advanced malignancies. : ADCC: antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity; ADCP: antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis; CFSE: carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester; Fab: fragment antigen binding; Fc: fragment crystallizable; FcγR: Fcγ receptor; Ig: immunoglobulin; IND: investigational new drug; MDM⊘: monocyte-derived macrophage; NOD: non-obese diabetic; scFv: single chain fragment variable; SCID: severe combined immunodeficiency; SIRP: signal-regulatory protein.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31464670>Sicca/Sjögren's syndrome triggered by PD-1/PD-L1  inhibitors.

For this study, patients who were investigated for a clinical suspicion of SS after being exposed to ICI were included.We identified 26 patients (11 women and 15 men, with a mean age at diagnosis of 63.57 years). Underlying cancer included lung (n=12), renal (n=7), melanoma (n=4), and other (n=3) neoplasia. Cancer immunotherapies consisted of monotherapy (77%) and combined regimens (23%). In those patients receiving monotherapy, all patients were treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (nivolumab in 9, pembrolizumab in 7 and durvalumab in 4); no cases associated with CTLA-4 inhibitors were identified. The main SS-related features consisted of dry mouth in 25 (96%) patients, dry eye in 17 (65%), abnormal ocular tests in 10/16 (62%) and abnormal oral diagnostic tests in 12/14 (86%) patients. Minor salivary gland biopsy was carried out in 15 patients: histopathological findings consisted of mild chronic sialadenitis in 8 (53%) patients and focal lymphocytic sialadenitis in the remaining 7 (47%); a focus score was measured in 5 of the 6 patients (mean of 1.8, range 1-4).

Therapeutic management included measures directed to treat sicca symptoms and therapies against autoimmune-mediated manifestations (glucocorticoids in 42%, second/third-line therapies in 31%); therapeutic response for systemic features was observed in 8/11 (73%). No patient died due to autoimmune involvement.Patients with Sjögren's syndrome triggered by ICI display a very specific profile different from that reported in idiopathic primary SS, including more frequent occurrence in men, a higher mean age, a predominant immunonegative serological profile, and a notable development of organ-specific autoimmune involvement in spite of the poor immunological profile. The close association found between sicca/Sjögren's syndrome and primarily PD-1 blockade requires further specific investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31258846>Prevalence of established and emerging biomarkers of   inhibitor response in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>The clinical deployment of   inhibitors (ICIs) has created a tandem drive for the identification of biomarkers linked to benefit. Comprehensive genomic profiling was performed to evaluate the frequency of genomic biomarkers of ICI response in 755 patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Median age was 62 years' old, 73% were male, 46% had extrahepatic disease, 107 had documented hepatitis C, 96 had hepatitis  and 4 patients were coinfected. Median tumor mutation burden (TMB) was 4 mutations/Mb and only 6 tumors (0.8%) were TMB-high. Out of 542 cases assessed for microsatellite instability (MSI), one (0.2%) was MSI-high and TMB-high. Twenty-seven (4%) patients had  alterations. One patient had a pathogenic  R762W mutation but TMB was 4 mutations/Mb. Forty percent had DNA damage response gene alterations. In a small case series (N=17) exploring the relationship between biomarkers and ICI response, one patient (TMB 15 mutations/Mb, MSI-low) had a sustained complete response to nivolumab lasting > 2 years. Otherwise there were no significant genomic or TMB differences between responders, progressors, and those with stable disease. Overall, markers of genomic instability were infrequent in this cohort. Larger clinically annotated datasets are needed to explore genomic and non-genomic determinants of ICI response in HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646086>Enhancing direct cytotoxicity and response to   blockade following ionizing radiation with Wee1 kinase inhibition.</a></h2><p>Tumor cells activate the G2/M    in response to ionizing radiation (IR) and effector  -derived granzyme  to facilitate repair and survival. Wee1 kinase inhibition reverses the ability of tumor cells to pause at G2/M. Here, we hypothesized that AZD1775, a small molecule inhibitor of Wee1 kinase, could sensitize tumor cells to IR and T-lymphocyte killing and improve responses to combination IR and programmed death (PD)-axis   blockade (ICB). Multiple models of head and neck carcinoma, lung carcinoma and melanoma were used  and  to explore this hypothesis. AZD1775 reversed G2/M    activation following IR, inducing  death. Combination IR and AZD1775 induced accumulation of DNA damage in M-phase cells and was rescued with nucleoside supplementation, indicating mitotic catastrophe. Combination treatment enhanced control of syngeneic MOC1 tumors , and on-target effects of systemic AZD1775 could be localized with targeted IR. Combination treatment enhanced granzyme -dependent T-lymphocyte killing through reversal of additive G2/M   block induced by IR and granzyme . Combination IR and AZ1775-enhanced CD8 -dependent MOC1 tumor growth control and rate of complete rejection of established tumors in the setting of PD-axis ICB. Functional assays demonstrated increased tumor antigen-specific  responses in sorted T-lymphocytes. The combination of IR and AZD1775 not only lead to enhanced tumor-specific cytotoxicity, it also enhanced susceptibility to T-lymphocyte killing and responses to PD-axis ICB. These data provide the pre-clinical rationale for the combination of these therapies in the clinical trial setting.© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31287161>Hitting back at lymphoma: How do modern diagnostics identify high-risk diffuse large - lymphoma subsets and alter treatment?</a></h2><p>Diffuse large - lymphoma (DLBCL) is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous disease. Diagnostic tools in the clinic can now identify distinct subsets characterized by unique molecular features, which are increasingly transforming how these patients are managed. Activated --like DLBCL is characterized by NF-κ activation and chronic - receptor signaling and may be targeted with lenalidomide or ibrutinib in the relapsed setting. Germinal center-like DLBCL is enriched for activating EZH2 mutations, and encouraging activity has been observed for the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat, which now has a fast-track US Food and Drug Administration designation. Double-hit lymphoma is a high-grade - lymphoma characterized by translocations of MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 and carries a poor prognosis. Intensive chemoimmunotherapy strategies appear to be superior to standard R-CHOP (rituximab combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) as initial therapy, and anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cells are inducing remission in patients with relapsed/refractory disease who previously had few available options. Primary mediastinal (thymic) large - lymphoma is a molecularly distinct large- lymphoma with clinical and molecular features that overlap with those of classical Hodgkin lymphoma. R-CHOP has been associated with an unacceptably high rate of primary treatment failure in this young population, whereas dose-adjusted EPOCH-R (etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin plus rituximab) produces durable remissions without the need for radiotherapy in most patients. For relapsed/refractory disease,   inhibitors targeting PD-1 have shown promising activity in chemotherapy-refractory disease, as have anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cells. Additional therapeutic targets, including JAK2, continue to be evaluated. The identification of discrete biological subsets is steadily moving us away from a "one-size-fits-all" approach in DLBCL.© 2019 American Cancer Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31159869>PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression correlated genes in non-small- lung cancer.</a></h2><p>Programmed  death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and ligand-2 (PD-L2) interaction with programmed  death protein-1 (PD-1) represent an -inhibiting  mediating  evasion and is, accordingly, an important target for blockade-based immunotherapy in cancer. In non-small- lung cancer (NSCLC), improved understanding of PD-1  blockade-responsive biology and identification of biomarkers for prediction of a clinical response to immunotherapy is warranted. Thus, in the present study, we systematically described PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression correlated genes in NSCLC.We performed comparative retrospective analyses to identify PD-L1 and PD-L2 mRNA expression correlated genes in NSCLC. For this, we examined available datasets from the cancer  line encyclopedia (CCLE) project lung non-small- (Lung_NSC) and the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) projects lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous  carcinoma (LUSC).Analysis of the CCLE dataset Lung_NSC identified expression correlation between PD-L1 and PD-L2. Moreover, we identified expression correlation between 489 genes and PD-L1, 191 genes and PD-L2, and 111 genes for both. PD-L1 and PD-L2 also expression correlated in TCGA datasets LUAD and LUSC. In LUAD, we identified expression correlation between 257 genes and PD-L1, 914 genes and PD-L2, and 211 genes for both. In LUSC, we identified expression correlation between 26 genes and PD-L1, 326 genes and PD-L2, and 13 genes for both. Only a few genes expression correlated with PD-L1 and PD-L2 across the CCLE and TCGA datasets. Expression of Interferon signaling-involved genes converged in particular with the expression correlated genes for PD-L1 in Lung_NSC, for PD-L2 in LUSC, and for both PD-L1 and PD-L2 in LUAD. In LUSC, PD-L1, and to a lesser extent PD-L2, expression correlated with chromosome 9p24 localized genes, indicating a chromosome 9p24 topologically associated domain as an important driver of in particular LUSC PD-L1 expression. Expression correlation analyses of the PD-L1 and PD-L2 receptors programmed  death protein-1 (PD-1), Cluster of differentiation 80 (CD80), and Repulsive guidance molecule  (RGMB) showed that PD-1 and CD80 expression correlated with both PD-L1 and PD-L2 in LUAD. CD80 expression correlated with PD-L2 in LUSC.We present gene signatures associated with PD-L1 and PD-L2 mRNA expression in NSCLC which could possess importance in relation to understand PD-1  blockade-responsive biology and development of gene signature based biomarkers for predicting clinical responses to immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31431704> inhibition to prevent or treat relapse in allogeneic hematopoietic  transplantation.</a></h2><p>In the past decades, survival has improved after allogeneic hematopoietic  transplantation (allo-HCT) due largely to advances in the prevention of graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) and opportunistic infection. However, few inroads have been made into the problem of leukemia relapse which is the primary reason for failure of allo-HCT. The graft-vs.-leukemia (GVL) response, in which engrafted immunocompetent donor  cells can eliminate leukemia cells, is acknowledged as the foundation upon which the curative potential of allo-HCT is based. Despite our strongly held faith in its existence, we remain unable to define GVL on a mechanistic level. T cells, in part, mediate GVL though the roles of specific T  subsets, NK cells,  cells, macrophages remain elusive. A higher frequency of marrow-infiltrating T cells expressing PD-1, CTLA-4, and TIM-3 and other   have been observed in relapsed patients compared to those in remission. Studies have described the association of T cells expressing an exhausted phenotype with response to  manipulation post-HCT. In light of these observations and the well documented activity of   blockade (CPB) in transplant naïve patients with hematologic malignancies, considerable interest has developed in evaluating strategies incorporating CPB to address relapse post-HCT. While  inhibitors may be provocative agents to test, they also raise concern for potential induction of GVHD and uncontrollable  breakthrough events. This review will lay the framework upon which CPB is being utilized post-HCT, describe early clinical results, and lay out future directions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569553>Noninvasive Imaging of the   LAG-3 Using Nanobodies, from Development to Pre-Clinical Use.</a></h2><p>  inhibition (ICI) is a promising cancer therapy, which has progressed rapidly from a preclinical concept to clinical implementation. Commonly considered targets in ICI are CTLA-4, PD-1/PD-L1, and LAG-3, and the list grows. As ICI is generally only beneficial for a subset of patients, there is a need to select patients that are eligible for therapy as well as to monitor therapy response. There is growing interest to do this noninvasively, by molecular imaging with target-specific tracers. To this day, noninvasive imaging has focused on CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1, while there is no noninvasive tool available to accurately assess LAG-3 expression in vivo. In this proof-of-concept study, we developed nanobodies, the smallest functional fragments from camelid heavy chain-only antibodies, to noninvasively evaluate mouse LAG-3 expression using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT imaging. The in vitro characterization of 114 nanobodies led to the selection of nine nanobodies binding to mouse LAG-3. The injection of Technetium-labeled nanobodies in healthy mice showed specific uptake in  peripheral organs like the spleen and lymph nodes, which was not observed in LAG-3 gene knock-out mice. Moreover, nanobody uptake could be visualized using SPECT/CT and correlated to the presence of LAG-3 as assessed in flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. SPECT/CT scans of tumor bearing mice further confirmed the diagnostic potential of the nanobodies. These findings substantiate the approach to use nanobodies as a tool to image inhibitory   in the tumor environment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540116>NK Cells as Potential Targets for Immunotherapy in Endometriosis.</a></h2><p>Endometriosis is a common gynecological disease defined by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, most frequently on the pelvic viscera and ovaries, which is associated with pelvic pains and infertility. It is an inflammatory disorder with some features of autoimmunity. It is accepted that ectopic endometriotic tissue originates from endometrial cells exfoliated during menstruation and disseminating into the peritoneum by retrograde menstrual blood flow. It is assumed that the survival of endometriotic cells in the peritoneal cavity may be partially due to their abrogated elimination by natural killer (NK) cells. The decrease of NK  cytotoxic activity in endometriosis is associated with an increased expression of some inhibitory NK  receptors. It may be also related to the expression of human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G), a ligand for inhibitory leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily  member 1 (LILRB1) receptors. The downregulated cytotoxic activity of NK cells may be due to inhibitory cytokines present in the peritoneal milieu of patients with endometriosis. The role of NK  receptors and their ligands in endometriosis is also confirmed by genetic association studies. Thus, endometriosis may be a subject of immunotherapy by blocking NK  negative control  including inhibitory NK  receptors. Immunotherapies with genetically modified NK cells also cannot be excluded.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312806>Therapeutic Vaccination Refocuses T- Responses Towards Conserved Regions of HIV-1 in Early Treated Individuals (BCN 01 study).</a></h2><p>Strong and broad antiviral T- responses targeting vulnerable sites of HIV-1 will likely be a critical component for any effective cure strategy.BCN01 trial was a phase I, open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study in HIV-1-positive individuals diagnosed and treated during early HIV-1 infection to evaluate two vaccination regimen arms, which differed in the time (8 versus 24 week) between the ChAdV63.HIVconsv prime and MVA.HIVconsv boost vaccinations. The primary outcome was safety. Secondary endpoints included frequencies of vaccine-induced IFN-γ CD8 T cells, in vitro virus-inhibitory capacity, plasma HIV-1 RNA and total CD4 T-cells associated HIV-1 DNA. ().No differences in safety, peak magnitude or durability of vaccine-induced responses were observed between long and short interval vaccination arms. Grade 1/2 local and systemic post-vaccination events occurred in 22/24 individuals and resolved within 3 days. Weak responses to conserved HIV-1 regions were detected in 50% of the individuals before cART initiation, representing median of less than 10% of their total HIV-1-specific T cells. All participants significantly elevated these subdominant T- responses, which after MVA.HIVconsv peaked at median (range) of 938 (73-6,805) IFN-γ SFU/10 PBMC, representing on average 58% of their total anti-HIV-1 T cells. The decay in the size of the HIV-1 reservoir was consistent with the first year of early cART initiation in both arms.Heterologous prime-boost vaccination with ChAdV63-MVA/HIVconsv was well-tolerated and refocused pre-cART T- responses towards more protective epitopes, in which  escape is frequently associated with reduced HIV-1 replicative fitness and which are common to most global HIV-1 variants.HIVACAT Catalan research program for an HIV vaccine and Fundació Gloria Soler. Vaccine manufacture was jointly funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) UK and the UK Department for International Development (DFID) under the MRC/DFID Concordat agreements (G0701669.Evidence Before this Study: T cells play an important role in the control of HIV infection and may be particularly useful for HIV-1 cure by killing cells with reactivated HIV-1. Evidence is emerging that not all T- responses are protective and mainly only those targeting conserved regions of HIV-1 proteins are effective, but typically immunologically subdominant, while those recognizing hypervariable, easy-to-escape immunodominant 'decoys' do not control viremia and do not protect from a loss of CD4 T cells. We pioneered a vaccine strategy focusing T- responses on the most conserved regions of the HIV-1 proteome using an immunogen designated HIVconsv. T cells elicited by the HIVconsv vaccines in HIV-uninfected UK and Kenyan adults inhibited in vitro replication of HIV-1 isolates from 4 major global clades A, , C and D.Added Value of this Study: The present study demonstrated the concept that epitopes subdominant in natural infection, when taken out of the context of the whole HIV-1 proteome and presented to the  system by a potent simian adenovirus prime-poxvirus MVA boost regimen, can induce strong responses in patients on antiretroviral treatment and efficiently refocus HIV-1-specific T-cells to the protective epitopes delivered by the vaccine.Implications of all the Available Evidence: Nearly all HIV-1 vaccine strategies currently emphasize induction of broadly neutralizing Abs. The HIVconsv vaccine is one of a very few approaches focussing exclusively on elicitation of T cells and, therefore, can complement antibody induction for better prevention and cure. Given the cross-clade reach on the HIVconsv immunogen design, if efficient, the HIVconsv vaccines could be deployed globally. Effective vaccines will likely be a necessary component in combination with other available preventive measures for halting the HIV-1/AIDS epidemic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31484424>Engaging Cytotoxic T and NK Cells for Immunotherapy in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.</a></h2><p>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by an acquired  dysfunction. CLL cells affect the phenotype and function of the entire spectrum of innate and adaptive  cells, including monocytes, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, leading to a tumor-supportive environment and reduced immunosurveillance. Novel immunotherapies like   blockade, bi- and tri-specific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells use the patients'  system to induce therapeutic responses. Although these novel immunotherapies showed impressive results in several   lymphomas, responses in CLL were often disappointing. The strong immunomodulatory effect of CLL is believed to play a pivotal role in the low response rates to these immunotherapeutic strategies. In this review, we summarize how CLL influences the function of non-malignant lymphocytes, with a special focus on T and NK cells, two important cellular mediators for immunotherapy. Secondly, we provide a short overview of the activity of several immunotherapeutics in CLL, and discuss how novel strategies may overcome the disappointing response rates in CLL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640780>Immunoglobulin somatic hypermutation has clinical impact in DLBCL and potential implications for   blockade and neoantigen-based immunotherapies.</a></h2><p>Diffuse large - lymphoma (DLBCL) harbors somatic hypermutation (SHM) in the immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain variable region genes, IGHV and IGK/LV. Recent studies have revealed that IGV SHM creates neoantigens that activate T- responses against - lymphoma.To determine the clinical relevance of IGV SHM in DLBCL treated with standard immunochemotherapy, we performed next-generation sequencing of the immunoglobulin variable regions and complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) for 378 patients with de novo DLBCL. The prognostic effects of IGV SHM and ongoing SHM or intra-clonal heterogeneity were analyzed in the training (192 patients), validation (186 patients), and overall DLBCL cohorts. To gain mechanistic insight, we analyzed the predicted IG-derived neoantigens' immunogenicity potential, determined by the major histocompatibility complex-binding affinity and the frequency-of-occurrence of T -exposed motifs (TCEMs) in a TCEM repertoire derived from human proteome, microbiome, and pathogen databases. Furthermore, IGV SHM was correlated with molecular characteristics of DLBCL and PD-1/L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment assessed by fluorescent multiplex immunohistochemistry.SHM was commonly found in IGHV and less frequently in IGK/LV. High levels of clonal IGHV SHM (SHM) were associated with prolonged overall survival in DLBCL patients, particularly those without BCL2 or MYC translocation. In contrast, long heavy chain CDR3 length, the presence of IGHV ongoing SHM in DLBCL, and high clonal IGK/LV SHM in germinal center --like (GCB)-DLBCL were associated with poor prognosis. These prognostic effects were significant in both the training and validation sets. By prediction, the SHM groups harbored more potentially -stimulatory neoantigens with high binding affinity and rare TCEMs. PD-1/L1 expression in CD8 T cells was significantly lower in IGHV SHM than in SHM patients with activated --like DLBCL, whereas PD-1 expression in CD4 T cells and PD-L1 expression in natural killer cells were higher in IGK/LV SHM than in SHM patients with GCB-DLBCL. PD-L1/L2 (9p24.1) amplification was associated with high IGHV SHM and ongoing SHM.These results show for the first time that IGV SHM and ongoing SHM have prognostic effects in DLBCL and potential implications for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and neoantigen-based immunotherapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31516556>The role of pembrolizumab in the treatment of PD-L1 expressing gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.</a></h2><p>Gastric cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide.

The genes examined include cellular markers of four   proteins (PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-1, and CTLA-4), immunosuppressive cells (regulatory T cells, tumor-associated macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells), pan-T lymphocytes,  lymphocytes, and neutrophils.Significant transient increase in gene expression was observed for PD-L1, PD-1, FOXP3, and CD204 at 6-8 doses of BCG. The patients were stratified into two groups depending on the number of genes with increased mRNA expression. Fourteen (58%) had 0-1 genes upregulated, while 10 (42%) had 2-4 genes with increased expression. No patient in the 0-1 group experienced recurrence, while 70% of patients in the 2-4 group experienced recurrence ( value = 0.037, hazard ratio = 5.93).Our findings suggested that increases in more than one of PD-L1, PD-1, FOXP3, and CD204, expression in the urine sediments was associated with resistance to BCG treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31046547>Sym021, a promising anti-PD1 clinical candidate antibody derived from a new chicken antibody discovery platform.</a></h2><p>Discovery of therapeutic antibodies is a field of intense development, where immunization of rodents remains a major source of antibody candidates. However, high orthologue protein sequence homology between human and rodent species disfavors generation of antibodies against functionally conserved binding epitopes. Chickens are phylogenetically distant from mammals. Since chickens generate antibodies from a restricted set of germline genes, the possibility of adapting the Symplex antibody discovery platform to chicken immunoglobulin genes and combining it with high-throughput humanization of antibody frameworks by "mass complementarity-determining region grafting" was explored. Hence, wild type chickens were immunized with an   inhibitor programmed  death 1 (PD1) antigen, and a repertoire of 144 antibodies was generated. The PD1 antibody repertoire was successfully humanized, and we found that most humanized antibodies retained affinity largely similar to that of the parental chicken antibodies. The lead antibody Sym021 blocked PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligand binding, resulting in elevated T- cytokine production in vitro. Detailed epitope mapping showed that the epitope recognized by Sym021 was unique compared to the clinically approved PD1 antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab. Moreover, Sym021 bound human PD1 with a stronger affinity (30 pM) compared to nivolumab and pembrolizumab, while also cross-reacting with cynomolgus and mouse PD1. This enabled direct testing of Sym021 in the syngeneic mouse in vivo cancer models and evaluation of preclinical toxicology in cynomolgus monkeys. Preclinical in vivo evaluation in various murine and human tumor models demonstrated a pronounced anti-tumor effect of Sym021, supporting its current evaluation in a Phase 1 clinical trial.

PMBL is characterized by high expression of programmed death-1 ligand and variable expression of CD30. Nivolumab, an anti-programmed death-1   inhibitor, and brentuximab vedotin (BV), an anti-CD30 antibody-drug conjugate, may have synergistic activity in R/R PMBL.The expansion cohort of the open-label, phase I/II CheckMate 436 study enrolled patients with confirmed R/R PMBL who were previously treated with either autologous hematopoietic  transplantation or two or more prior chemotherapy regimens if ineligible for autologous hematopoietic  transplantation. Patients received nivolumab (240 mg intravenously) and BV (1.8 mg/kg intravenously) every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary end points were investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) per the Lugano 2014 criteria and safety.Thirty patients with PMBL were treated and evaluable. At a median follow-up of 11.1 months, ORR (95% CI) was 73% (54% to 88%), with a 37% complete remission rate per investigator, and ORR of 70% (51% to 85%), with a 43% complete metabolic response rate per independent review. Median duration of response, median progression-free survival, and median overall survival have not been reached. Eleven responders had consolidation with autologous (n = 5) or allogeneic (n = 6) transplantation. Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 25 patients (83%). Sixteen patients (53%) had grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events; the most common were neutropenia (n = 9), thrombocytopenia (n = 3), and peripheral neuropathy (n = 3).

We explored whether a decline in AFP levels was also associated with treatment outcomes of   inhibitors (ICIs) in patients with advanced HCC.We reviewed all patients who received ICI therapy for advanced HCC. AFP response was evaluated in patients with the pretreatment AFP level of >20 ng/mL. We defined early AFP response as a >20% decline in serum AFP levels within the first 4 weeks of treatment initiation relative to pretreatment levels. We then studied whether early AFP response was associated with treatment outcomes.Sixty patients were enrolled in this study; 43 of them were evaluable for early AFP response. The objective response rate of early AFP responders was significantly higher than that of early AFP nonresponders (73% vs. 14%, P < .001). Early AFP responders, compared with early AFP nonresponders, exhibited significantly longer overall survival (OS) (median, 28.0 vs 11.2 months, P = .048) and progression-free survival (PFS) (median, 15.2 vs 2.7 months, P = .002).

The use of anti-CTLA-4/PD-1 /PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies to block the tumor signaling pathway has shown excellent anti-tumor efficacy in a variety of solid tumors, and it is expected that immunotherapy will be available for the treatment of 60% advanced tumors in the next decade. Esophageal cancer is one of the major causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and its 5-year survival rate is generally low. Currently, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgery are the standard treatments for esophageal cancer, and there is no effective treatment scheme for patients with esophageal cancer who fail to respond to standard treatment. Due to the diversity of somatic  gene mutations and the generation of neo-antigens in esophageal cancer, immunotherapy has become a feasible treatment scheme to improve the prognosis of esophageal cancer. In this situation, the application of immunotherapy for esophageal cancer or more specific   inhibitors has gradually become the focus of the treatment of esophageal cancer. Nowadays, the research of   inhibitors, such as ipilimumab, tremelimumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab and avelumab on esophageal cancer is proceeding at an amazing speed. The phase Ⅰ  clinical study of immunotherapy for esophageal cancer, which previously attracted great interest, has been replaced by the phase Ⅲ clinical study, and the results of the relevant studies also show a good prospect for the application of   inhibitors for esophageal cancer. However, the prediction of therapeutic effect and the selection of the best candidates still need to be further studied.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625721>Co-delivery of Bee Venom Melittin and a Photosensitizer with an Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Nanocarrier for Photodynamic Therapy and Immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a clinical cancer treatment modality based on the induction of therapeutic reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can trigger immunogenic  death (ICD). With the aim of simultaneously improving both PDT-mediated intracellular ROS production and ICD levels, we designed a serum albumin (SA)-coated boehmite (""; aluminum hydroxide oxide) organic-inorganic scaffold that could be loaded with chlorin e6 (Ce6), a photosensitizer, and a honey bee venom melittin (MLT) peptide, denoted Ce6/MLT@SAB. Ce6/MLT@SAB was anchored by a boehmite nanorod structure and exhibited particle size of approximately 180 nm. Ce6/MLT@SAB could significantly reduce hemolysis relative to that of free MLT, while providing MLT-enhanced PDT antitumor effects . Compared with Ce6@SAB, Ce6/MLT@SAB improved Ce6 penetration of cancer cells both  and , thereby providing enhanced intracellular ROS generation with 660 nm light treatment. Following phototreatment, Ce6/MLT@SAB-treated cells displayed significantly improved levels of ICD and abilities to activate dendritic cells. In the absence of laser irradiation, multidose injection of Ce6/MLT@SAB could delay the growth of subcutaneous murine tumors by more than 60%, compared to controls. When combined with laser irradiation, a single injection and phototreatment with Ce6/MLT@SAB eradicated one-third of subcutaneous tumors in treated mice. The addition of an   blockade to Ce6/MLT@SAB phototreatment further augmented antitumor effects, generating increased numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells in tumors with concomitant reduction of myeloid-derived suppressor cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306680>Anti-PD-1 blockade with nivolumab with and without therapeutic vaccination for virally suppressed chronic hepatitis : A pilot study.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the hypothesis that increasing T  frequency and activity may provide durable control of hepatitis  virus (HBV), we administered nivolumab, a programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, with or without GS-4774, an HBV therapeutic vaccine, in virally suppressed patients with HBV e antigen (HBeAg)-negative chronic HBV.In a phase Ib study, patients received either a single dose of nivolumab at 0.1 mg/kg (n = 2) or 0.3 mg/kg (n = 12), or 40 yeast units of GS-4774 at baseline and week 4 and 0.3 mg/kg of nivolumab at week 4 (n = 10). The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change in HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) 12 weeks after nivolumab. Safety and immunologic changes were assessed through week 24.There were no grade 3 or 4 adverse events or serious adverse events. All assessed patients retained T  PD-1 receptor occupancy 6-12 weeks post-infusion, with a mean total across 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg cohorts of 76% (95% CI 75-77), and no significant differences were observed between cohorts (p = 0.839). Patients receiving 0.3 mg/kg nivolumab without and with GS-4774 had mean declines of -0.30 (95% CI -0.46 to -0.14) and -0.16 (95% CI -0.33 to 0.01) log IU/ml, respectively. Patients showed significant HBsAg declines from baseline (p = 0.035) with 3 patients experiencing declines of >0.5 log by the end of study. One patient, whose HBsAg went from baseline 1,173 IU/ml to undetectable at week 20, experienced an alanine aminotransferase flare (grade 3) at week 4 that resolved by week 8 and was accompanied by a significant increase in peripheral HBsAg-specific T cells at week 24.In virally suppressed HBeAg-negative patients,  blockade was well-tolerated and led to HBsAg decline in most patients and sustained HBsAg loss in 1 patient.Chronic hepatitis  virus infection (CHB) is characterized by a dysfunctional  response. In patients with CHB, inhibitory receptors, such as programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) are overexpressed on T cells, leading to an ineffective  response in the liver. Herein, we show that the PD-1 inhibitor, nivolumab, is safe and effective for the treatment of virally suppressed patients with CHB.

While a number of clinical trials are ongoing, testing all possible combinations is not feasible. In this study, a quantitative systems pharmacology model is built to integrate -cancer  interactions in patients with breast cancer, including central, peripheral, tumour-draining lymph node (TDLN) and tumour compartments. The model can describe the  suppression and evasion in both TDLN and the tumour microenvironment due to  expression, and mimic the tumour response to  blockade therapy. We investigate the relationship between the tumour response to  blockade therapy and composite tumour burden, PD-L1 expression and antigen intensity, including their individual and combined effects on the  system, using model-based simulations. The proposed model demonstrates the potential to make predictions of tumour response of individual patients given sufficient clinical measurements, and provides a platform that can be further adapted to other types of immunotherapy and their combination with molecular-targeted therapies. The patient predictions demonstrate how this systems pharmacology model can be used to individualize immunotherapy treatments. When appropriately validated, these approaches may contribute to optimization of breast cancer treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31113806>An Artificial Antigen-Presenting  Delivering 11  Molecules Expands Tumor Antigen-Specific CTLs in  and  Murine Melanoma Models.</a></h2><p>Antigen-presenting cells expand antigen-specific T cells  and  for tumor immunotherapy, but are time-consuming to generate and, as live cells, raise biosafety concerns. An alternative is found in -free artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPC), but these only present two or three kinds of  molecules. Here, we describe a multipotent artificial antigen-presenting  (MaAPC) that delivered 11 kinds of  moleclues. This MaAPC simulated natural APCs through the concurent coupling of target antigens (H-2K/TRP2-Ig dimers and H-2D/gp100-Ig dimers), costimulatory molecules (anti-CD28, anti-4-1BB, and anti-CD2), and "self-marker" CD47-Fc onto surface-modified polylactic-co-glycolic acid microparticles (PLGA-MP). These PLGA-MPs also encapsulated cytokines (IL2 and IL15), a chemokine (CCL21), and  inhibitors (anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1). Culture of MaAPCs with naïve T cells for 1 week elevated the frequencies of TRP2-specific and gp100-specific CTLs to 51.0% and 43.3%, respectively, with enhanced cytotoxicity. Three infusions of MaAPCs inhibited subcutaneous melanoma growth in a mouse model and expanded TRP2 and gp100-specific CTLs 59-86-fold in peripheral blood, 76-77-fold in spleen, and 205-212-fold in tumor tissue, in an antigen-specific manner. Compared with conventional aAPCs carrying two or three  molecules, the 11-signal MaAPCs exerted greater impact on T cells, including activation, proliferation, cytotoxicity, differentiation to memory CTLs or regulatory T cells and cytokines profiles, without detected side effects. Such MaAPCs could be used to individualize tumor immunotherapy.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610173>RNA Expression Profiling of Lymphoepithelioma-Like Carcinoma of the Bladder Reveals a Basal-like Molecular Subtype.</a></h2><p>Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the bladder (LELC-) is a rare subtype of urothelial carcinoma consisting of undifferentiated epithelial cells within a dense inflammatory  infiltrate. We set out to molecularly characterize LELC- through RNA expression profiling as well as immunohistochemistry to understand its underlying biology. Sixteen cases of LELC- were identified at Johns Hopkins University. RNAseq was performed on 14 cases. Immunohistochemical staining for PD-L1 and mismatch repair proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 was performed. Transcriptomic profiling of LELC- showed that they are enriched in a basal-like phenotype, with 12 of 14 LELC- cases correlating to the basal centroid of the BASE47 PAM classifier. Gene signature analysis confirmed the lymphocyte infiltration profile consistent with the histomorphology. LELC- lacked features to explain the robust lymphocytic infiltrate, such as loss of mismatch repair protein expression or expression of Epstein-Barr virus transcripts. Nonetheless, PD-L1 immunohistochemistry was positive in 93% of LELC cases. Our study demonstrates that LELC- tumors are enriched in a basal-like molecular subtype, share a high level of  infiltration and PD-L1 expression similar to basal tumors. The basal-like phenotype is consistent with the known sensitivity of LELC- to chemotherapy and suggests that   therapy should be explored in this rare disease.Copyright © 2019.

Oncolytic virus-based therapies may further improve the outcome of these cancer patients. A human  melanoma model was used to investigate the oncolytic parvovirus H-1 (H-1PV) in combination with ipilimumab and/or nivolumab. The effect of this combination on activation of human T lymphocytes was demonstrated. Expression of CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1   proteins was upregulated in H-1PV-infected melanoma cells. Nevertheless, maturation of antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells was triggered by H-1PV infected melanoma cells. Combining H-1PV with  inhibitors, ipilimumab enhanced TNFα release during maturation of dendritic cells; nivolumab increased the amount of IFNγ release. H-1PV mediated reduction of regulatory T  activity was demonstrated by lower TGF-ß levels. The combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab resulted in a further decline of TGF-ß levels. Similar results were obtained regarding the activation of cytotoxic T cells. H-1PV infection alone and in combination with both  inhibitors caused strong activation of CTLs, which was reflected by an increased number of CD8GranB cells and increased release of granzyme , IFNγ, and TNFα. Our data support the concept of a treatment benefit from combining oncolytic H-1PV with the  inhibitors ipilimumab and nivolumab, with nivolumab inducing stronger effects on cytotoxic T cells, and ipilimumab strengthening T lymphocyte activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109321>Loss of the transcriptional repressor TGIF1 results in enhanced Kras-driven development of pancreatic cancer.</a></h2><p>The TG-interacting factor 1 (TGIF1) gene, which encodes a nuclear transcriptional corepressor of the TGFβ1/Smad signaling pathway, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various types of human cancer; however, its role in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has yet to be elucidated.The expression of TGIF1 in human and murine PDAC specimens were detected by IHC analysis. The functions of TGIF1 in in vivo PDAC growth, dissemination, and metastasis were assessed using conditional inactivation of TGIF1 in well-established autochthonous mouse models of PDAC. Primary cells from TGIF1 null or wild type PDAC mice were examined by assays for  proliferation, migration, invasion, soft agar and xenograft tumorigenesis. Gene expression profiling, pathway analyses, epigenetic changes associated with TGIF1 loss, and in vitro and in vivo effects of 4-MU were assessed.Conditional deletion of TGIF1 in the mouse pancreas had no discernible effect on pancreatic development or physiology. Notably, TGIF1 loss induced KrasG12D-driven PDAC models exhibited shorter latency and greater propensity for distant metastases. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms highlighted the TGIF1 loss-induced activation of the hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2)-CD44 signaling pathway and upregulation of the   regulator PD-L1 to facilitate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor  suppression. We also founded that TGIF1 might function as an epigenetic regulator and response for aberrant EMT gene expression during PDAC progression.Our results imply that targeting the HAS2 pathway in TGIF1 loss of PDAC could be a promising therapeutic strategy for improving the clinical efficacy against PDAC metastasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156625>Dynamics of Expression of Programmed  Death Protein-1 (PD-1) on T Cells After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem  Transplantation.</a></h2><p> exhaustion contributes to treatment failure after allogeneic hematopoietic stem  transplantation (HSCT) for hematological malignancies.   blockade, including programmed  death protein-1 (PD-1) blockade, is a promising strategy to improve the antitumor effect of allogeneic HSCT with high rates of response reported in patients treated for disease relapse. However, severe and sometimes fatal Graft- vs.-Host-Disease (GvHD) has been reported as a complication. Little is known about the dynamics of PD-1 expression on  effector cells after allogeneic HSCT. In the present study, we analyzed PD-1 expression on T  subpopulations isolated from 105 allogeneic HSCT recipients. Our analysis revealed a significant increase in proportions of PD-1-expressing CD4 and CD8 T cells early after allogeneic HSCT followed by a progressive normalization of PD-1 expression at CD8 but not CD4 T  surface. Analysis of co-expression of two other exhaustion markers, 2B4 and CD160, revealed a preferential expansion of PD-1-single positive cells. Moreover, the analysis of granzyme  and perforin expression in PD-1+ and PD-1- CD8 T cells from HSCT recipients did not reveal any impairment in cytotoxic molecules production by PD-1-expressing CD8 T cells. Analyzing the association between clinical factors and the expression of PD-1 on T cells, we identified the use of  and/or  T- depletion as the factor most strongly associated with elevated PD-1 levels on T cells. Our results extend our knowledge of the regulation of PD-1 expression at T  surface after allogeneic HSCT, a crucial information for the optimization of post-transplantation PD-1 blocking therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31151943>Immunology and Immunotherapy in Critical Care: An Overview.</a></h2><p>Until recently, immunology was not a major focus of attention in the acute and critical care setting. With the evolution of immunotherapy, however-including the development of monoclonal antibodies,  inhibitors, and adoptive cellular therapies-an in-depth understanding of the  system has become necessary to properly care for acutely ill patients. Lymphocytes (ie, T cells and  cells) play a major role in the daily functioning of the  response.

PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay predicts the response to immunotherapy, but cytology specimens are often the only samples available in a considerable proportion of advanced lung cancer patients. We delineate practical feasibility and efficacy of cytology -block (CB) specimens for PD-L1 expression and concordance between cytology CBs and surgical resection specimens.In total, 58 eligible patients with primary lung cancer who received computed tomography-guided percutaneous needle aspiration and surgery were included. PD-L1 IHC (clone SP263) was performed on CBs prepared from residual liquid-based cytology material and matched surgical resection specimens. PD-L1 positive tumour  proportion was categorised in four score groups: (a) <1%; () ≤1% to <10%; (c) ≤10% to <50%, (d) ≥50%.Comparison of PD-L1 expression in cytology CBs and matched surgical resection specimens showed a high concordance (κ value 0.65). According to the therapeutic guideline of immunotherapeutic agents, a positive percent agreement was 94.34%, and a negative percent agreement was 100% at a cut-off value for positivity of 1% PD-L1 expression. There was a significant difference observed with regard to rates of PD-L1 positivity when comparing smoking history (P = 0.02), age (P = 0.04) and pathological TNM stage (P = 0.04).The results show that cytology CBs evaluated for PD-L1 IHC assay have high concordance with matched surgical resection specimens and can be used for assessing PD-L1 expression. Also, we propose that CBs are suitable materials for evaluating PD-L1 expression while simultaneously performing both diagnostic and molecular tests.© 2019 The Authors.

Both targeted and -therapy now have evidence in earlier stage disease. There are many new agents and combinations of treatments in development as potential future treatment options. This highlights the need for a reflection on current treatment practice trends that are guiding the development of potential new therapies.In this review, the authors discuss the evidence for currently approved therapies for cutaneous melanoma, including adjuvant therapy, potential new biomarkers, and emerging treatments with early phase clinical trial data. The authors have searched both the PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov databases for published clinical trials and discuss selected landmark trials of current therapies and of investigational treatment strategies with early evidence for the treatment of melanoma.Significant efficacy has been demonstrated with both   inhibitors and targeted therapies in treating advanced melanoma. A multitude of novel therapies are in development and there is need for instructive biomarker assessment to identify patients likely to respond or be refractory to current therapies, to identify mechanisms of resistance and to direct further treatment options to patients based on individual disease biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200747>  depletion or absence does not impede anti-tumor activity of PD-1 inhibitors.</a></h2><p>PD-1 inhibitors are approved for multiple malignancies and function by stimulating T cells. However, the role of  cells in the anti-tumor activity of these drugs is unknown, as is their activity in patients who have received   depleting drugs or with immunoglobulin deficiencies.We studied   content in 40 melanomas from patients treated with pembrolizumab or nivolumab and assessed the association with response to therapy. Murine MC38 colon cancer and YUMMER1.7 melanoma models were used to determine whether concomitant anti-CD20 antibody injections diminish the anti-tumor effects of anti-PD-1. Results were validated in muMT mice, which lack  cells. cells were sparse in most melanomas and   content was not associated with response to anti-PD-1 or overall survival. Employing MC38 and YUMMER1.7 models, we demonstrated that anti-CD20 antibodies reduce tumor-infiltrating  cells yet had no effect on tumor growth, response to PD-1 inhibition, or survival. In muMT mice, T- dependent tumor rejection and anti-PD-1 responses were no different than in wildtype C57BL/6 J mice.The degree of tumor infiltrating   content is not associated with response to anti-PD-1 inhibitors in melanoma. PD-1 inhibitors cause tumor shrinkage in murine cancer models even when  cells are absent or are depleted. PD-1 inhibitors are likely to be active in patients with impaired   function, such as patients undergoing   depletion with drugs including rituximab for conditions such as   malignancies or autoimmune disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31217788>Highlight report: Relevance of T-cells, -cells and   factors for prognosis of breast cancer.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31238970>Optimized fractionated radiotherapy with anti-PD-L1 and anti-TIGIT: a promising new combination.</a></h2><p>Radiotherapy (RT) induces an immunogenic antitumor response, but also some immunosuppressive barriers. It remains unclear how different fractionation protocols can modulate the  microenvironment. Clinical studies are ongoing to evaluate   inhibitors (ICI) in association with RT. However, only few trials aim to optimize the RT fractionation to improve efficacy of these associations. Here we sought to characterize the effect of different fractionation protocols on  response with a view to associating them with ICI.Mice bearing subcutaneous CT26 colon tumors were irradiated using a SARRP device according to different radiation schemes with a same biologically effective dose. Mice were monitored for tumor growth. The radiation  response (lymphoid, myeloid cells, lymphoid cytokines and   targets) was monitored by flow cytometry at different timepoints after treatment and by RNA sequencing analysis (RNAseq). The same radiation protocols were performed with and without inhibitors of   modulated by RT.In the absence of ICI, we showed that 18x2Gy and 3x8Gy induced the longest tumor growth delay compared to 1×16.4Gy. While 3x8Gy and 1×16.4Gy induced a lymphoid response (CD8 T-cells, Regulators T-cells), 18x2Gy induced a myeloid response (myeloid-derived suppressor cells, tumor-associated macrophages 2). The secretion of granzyme  by CD8 T cells was increased to a greater extent with 3x8Gy. The expression of PD-L1 by tumor cells was moderately increased by RT, but most durably with 18x2Gy. T  immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) expression by CD8 T-cells was increased with 3x8Gy, but decreased with 18x2Gy. These results were also observed with RNAseq. RT was dramatically more effective with 3x8Gy compared to all the other treatments schemes when associated with anti-TIGIT and anti-PD-L1 (9/10 mice in complete response). The association of anti-PD-L1 and RT was also effective in the 18x2Gy group (8/12 mice in complete response).Each fractionation scheme induced different lymphoid and myeloid responses as well as various modulations of PD-L1 and TIGIT expression. Furthermore, 3x8Gy was the most effective protocol when associated with anti-PD-L1 and anti-TIGIT.

By including patients underrepresented in clinical trials, such as those with brain metastasis (BM), higher age, more comorbidity and poorer performance status (ECOG), comparison of unselected patients to clinical trial populations is possible.  Real life data were gathered from 118 consecutive NSCLC patients with incurable NSCLC treated with ICI at the Department of Oncology at the University Hospital of Odense, Denmark from September 2015 to April 2018. -related adverse events (irAEs) grades 3-5 were registered prospectively during the same period. Additional patient related data were obtained retrospectively from patients' files. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimates, the log-rank test and cox regression analysis performed for factors affecting survival.  Median age for patients was 66 years (IQR 59-71) and 62 years (range: 55-64) for those with BM.

For patients with BM, the median OS was 8.2 months (HR 1.38, [95% CI: 0.7-2.5],  = .37). Twenty-four percent of patients terminated ICI due to irAE grades 3-5 alone (grade 5,   =  1), which were not associated with higher age or BM.  OS and PFS were comparable to clinical trial reports.

A key compartment in this  is the extracellular matrix (ECM) and its related components - matrisome. Yet, little is known about the extent to which matrisome pattern is conserved in progressive tumors across diverse cancer types. Using integrative genomic approaches, we conducted multi-platform assessment of a measure of deregulated matrisome associated with tumor progression, termed as tumor matrisome index (TMI), in over 30,000 patient-derived samples. Combined quantitative analyses of genomics and proteomics reveal that TMI is closely associated with mutational load, tumor pathology, and predicts survival across different malignancies. Interestingly, we observed an enrichment of specific tumor-infiltrating   populations, along with signatures predictive of resistance to   blockade immunotherapy, and clinically targetable   in TMI tumors. B7-H3 emerged as a particularly promising target for anti-tumor immunity in these tumors.

Importantly, TNF neutralization is also used for the treatment of corticosteroid-refractory -related adverse events (irAEs) induced by the combined anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy. The manifestation of these toxicities is an important limiting factor for the successful implementation of the inhibitory  blockade therapy (ICB), restraining its anti-tumor efficacy. In our recent study (Perez-Ruiz , Nature 569(7756): 428-432.), we analyzed the potential impact of prophylactic TNF neutralization therapy in the anti-PD1/CTLA-4 efficacy. Through several mouse models, we demonstrated that TNF neutralization ameliorated ICB-exacerbated colitis in addition to improving ICB-dependent anti-tumor efficacy. Similar results were obtained after prophylactic TNF blockade in graft vs host xenografted mouse models with human  cells, which showed a reduction in colitis and hepatitis. Importantly, there was a preservation of the immunotherapeutic control of xenografted tumors after ICB treatment. Moreover, TNF and TNF-dependent gene expression is upregulated in the colon mucosa from patients affected by colitis as a side effect of ipilimumab and nivolumab. Our results, thus, provide evidence of the successful combination of prophylactic TNF neutralization with ICB therapy strategy to ameliorate toxicities, while keeping or even ameliorating anti-tumor efficacy. The prophylactic TNF blockade strategy is clinically feasible since excellent TNF inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of autoimmunity and are used for the -related serious adverse events in immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31378985>Review article:   inhibitors and the liver, from therapeutic efficacy to side effects.</a></h2><p>  inhibitors have revolutionised the oncological landscape in the last few years.

The evasion of cancer cells from  surveillance is prevented by   inhibitors, allowing the patient's own  system to attack their cancer.   inhibitors have shown improvement in overall survival for melanoma, lung cancer and renal  carcinoma in clinical trials. Unfortunately, not all patients respond to this therapy.In cancer management, percutaneous ablation techniques are well established for both cure and local control of many tumour types. Cryoablation of the tumour tissue results in  destruction by freezing. Contrary to heat-based ablative modalities, cryoablation induces tumour  death by osmosis and necrosis. It is hypothesised that with necrosis, the intracellular contents of the cancer cells stay intact allowing the  system to induce an -specific reaction. This -specific reaction can, in theory, also affect cancer cells outside the ablated tissue, known as the abscopal effect. Unfortunately, this effect is rarely observed, but when cryoablation is combined with immunotherapy, the effect of both therapies may be enhanced. Although several preclinical studies demonstrated a synergistic effect between cryoablation and immunotherapy, prospective clinical trials are needed to prove this clinical benefit for patients. In this review, we will outline the current evidence for the combination of cryoablation with immunotherapy to treat cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31085720>Myocarditis in Cynomolgus Monkeys Following Treatment with   Inhibitors.</a></h2><p>  inhibitors (ICI) targeting PD1, PDL1, or CTLA4 are associated with -related adverse events (irAE) in multiple organ systems including myocarditis. The pathogenesis and early diagnostic markers for ICI-induced myocarditis are poorly understood, and there is currently a lack of laboratory animal model to enhance our understanding. We aimed to develop such a model using cynomolgus monkeys.Chinese-origin cynomolgus monkeys were dosed intravenously with vehicle or nivolumab 20 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 15 mg/kg once weekly and euthanized on day 29.Multiple organ toxicities were observed in cynomolgus monkeys, and were characterized by loose feces, lymphadenopathy, and mononuclear  infiltrations of varying severity in heart, colon, kidneys, liver, salivary glands, and endocrine organs. Increased proliferation of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes as well as an increase in activated T cells and central memory T cells in the blood, spleen, and lymph nodes, were observed. Transcriptomic analysis suggested increased migration and activation of T cells and increased phagocytosis and antigen presentation in the heart. Mononuclear  infiltration in myocardium was comprised primarily of T cells, with lower numbers of macrophages and occasional  cells, and was associated with minimal cardiomyocyte degeneration as well as increases in cardiac troponin-I and NT-pro-BNP. Morphologically, cardiac lesions in our monkey model are similar to the reported ICI myocarditis in humans.We have developed a monkey model characterized by multiple organ toxicities including myocarditis.

We aimed to assess the activity of nivolumab in this population.The GETUG-AFU 26 NIVOREN phase II trial assessed the activity and safety of nivolumab in patients with metastatic ccRCC who failed vascular endothelial growth factor-directed therapies (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: ). Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases were prospectively identified and underwent dedicated brain evaluation. Two cohorts were constituted: cohort A comprised patients with previously untreated brain metastases, and cohort  comprised patients whose brain metastases underwent prior therapy. The primary end point was intracranial response rate in cohort A.Seventy-three patients with brain metastases were included: 39 in cohort A and 34 in cohort . Intracranial response rate was 12% in cohort A; no objective response was reported in patients with brain lesions that were multiple or larger than 1 cm. Median intracranial progression-free survival was 2.7 months (95% CI, 2.3 to 4.6 months) in cohort A and 4.8 months (95% CI, 3.0 to 8.0 months) in cohort , with adjusted hazard ratio of 2.04 (95% CI, 1.08 to 3.83). Overall survival rate at 12 months was 67% (95% CI, 49.6% to 79.1%) in cohort A and 59% (95% CI, 40.6% to 73.2%) in cohort . Most patients in cohort A (72%) needed subsequent focal brain therapy. Nivolumab was well tolerated, with no unexpected toxicity.Nivolumab activity is limited in patients with untreated brain metastases from ccRCC.

One of the factors accounting for this variability is the expression level of the   molecule that differs between cancer types; thus, it is important to clarify the relationship between clinical outcomes and   molecules for all types of human cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical outcome of osteosarcoma in relation to PD-L1, PRF, GZMB, and IFNγ expression.Using 19 clinical specimens of osteosarcoma, we examined the expression of PD-L1, PRF, GZMB, and IFNγ in relation to their clinical outcomes.PD-L1 expression correlated with early metastatic formation in clinical specimens of osteosarcoma, and the group with highly expressed functional markers for T cells such as PRF and GZMB resulted in a long overall survival time.This is the first study to elucidate the clinical outcomes of osteosarcoma in relation to PD-L1, PRF, GZMB, and IFNγ expression. This study provides valuable information regarding the clinical indication and prediction of effect for anti-PD-1 antibody in osteosarcoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31092922>Targeting the CBM complex causes T cells to prime tumours for   therapy.</a></h2><p>Solid tumours are infiltrated by effector T cells with the potential to control or reject them, as well as by regulatory T (T) cells that restrict the function of effector T cells and thereby promote tumour growth. The anti-tumour activity of effector T cells can be therapeutically unleashed, and is now being exploited for the treatment of some forms of human cancer. However, weak tumour-associated inflammatory responses and the -suppressive function of T cells remain major hurdles to broader effectiveness of tumour immunotherapy. Here we show that, after disruption of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signalosome complex, most tumour-infiltrating T cells produce IFNγ, resulting in stunted tumour growth. Notably, genetic deletion of both or even just one allele of CARMA1 (also known as Card11) in only a fraction of T cells-which avoided systemic autoimmunity-was sufficient to produce this anti-tumour effect, showing that it is not the mere loss of suppressive function but the gain of effector activity by T cells that initiates tumour control. The production of IFNγ by T cells was accompanied by activation of macrophages and upregulation of class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex on tumour cells. However, tumour cells also upregulated the expression of PD-L1, which indicates activation of adaptive  resistance. Consequently, blockade of PD-1 together with CARMA1 deletion caused rejection of tumours that otherwise do not respond to anti-PD-1 monotherapy. This effect was reproduced by pharmacological inhibition of the CBM protein MALT1. Our results demonstrate that partial disruption of the CBM complex and induction of IFNγ secretion in the preferentially self-reactive T  pool does not cause systemic autoimmunity but is sufficient to prime the tumour environment for successful   therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31405063>KRAS-Driven Lung Adenocarcinoma and   Infiltration: Novel Insights for Immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>Non-small- lung cancer, histologically classified into adenocarcinoma (AD) and squamous  carcinoma, is one of the most deadly malignancies worldwide. Lung AD (LUAD) could benefit of a plethora of target therapies and, in the last few years, also of immunotherapies. Here we focused on a real-life cohort of LUAD and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-LUAD dataset aiming to gain insights into the  contexture of such a malignancy. We explored the mutational status of 41 genes and the expression of 94 genes, related to -, inflammation, and stromal microenvironment. Surprisingly, we found that our cohort has a very low mutational burden if we consider our panel as its surrogate. Regarding gene expression data, we identified 31 genes significantly deregulated in tumor tissues compared with a pool of normal samples. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the deregulated genes is able to identify two clusters of tumor samples, differently enriched in alterations in actionable genes. In particular, we identified a cluster enriched in patients carrying  alterations. In silico deconvolution, that is the inferring of tumor microenvironment composition by gene expression data, through TIMER algorithm has been performed to explore  microenvironment. Estimation performed on our gene expression matrix showed that   infiltration is lower in the -mutated enriched cluster, as in the TCGA-LUAD dataset. Such a finding has been validated in situ through immunohistochemistry in an independent cohort. Moreover, cases in LUAD-TCGA with low   infiltration have a significantly worse overall survival than those with higher levels. In the real-life cohort we observed that cases belonging to cluster enriched in -mutated patients have a poor outcome. LUAD driven by  mutation represents an unmet clinical need, being refractory to pharmacological inhibition. Our results link  mutations to   infiltration. Thus, the present findings could be helpful in a better definition of immunotherapeutic approaches for  mutated patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31568700>MIR155HG is a prognostic biomarker and associated with  infiltration and   molecules expression in multiple cancers.</a></h2><p>In recent years,   inhibitor has achieved remarkable success in multiple cancer treatment. However, how to pre-judge which patients are suitable for   inhibitor is a difficult problem. We use the existing public bioinformatics database to comprehensively analyze the relationship between clinical data of various cancers with   blocking molecules and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and try to find the potential predictive value of lncRNA for immunotherapy with  inhibitors. In this study, we found that: (a) high expression of lncRNA MIR155 host gene (MIR155HG) was closely related to better overall survival (OS) in cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), and have better disease-free survival (DFS) in CHOL. Meanwhile, the high level of MIR155HG was associated with poorer OS in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), kidney renal clear  carcinoma (KIRC), brain lower grade glioma (LGG), and uveal melanoma (UVM). () The expression of MIR155HG was significantly correlated with infiltrating levels of  cells and  molecules, especially with   molecules such as programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1), PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) in most kinds of cancers. (c) Detection of clinical CHOL and liver hepatocellular carcinoma tissues confirmed that there was a strong positive correlation between MIR155HG expression and the levels of CTLA4 and PD-L1. MIR155 host gene can be used as a prognostic marker in multiple cancers, and of great value in predicting the curative effect of   inhibitor therapy owing to it is closely related with  cells infiltration and   molecules expression.© 2019 The Authors.

Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains a treatment challenge despite years of research. In this study, we analyzed the status of TIGIT expression in circulating T cells from patients with adult ALL. Compared to the data in healthy controls, the expression of TIGIT in CD4CD25 T cells and CD8 T cells in adult ALL patients presented a small but significant upregulation. Stimulation via the CD3/CD28 route increased TIGIT mRNA expression at 24 h, which peaked at 48 h and was maintained at 72 h post-stimulation. The frequency of TIGIT cells, on the other hand, consistently increased over time. ALL protein lysate or Wilms' Tumor 1 peptide could significantly increase the expression of TIGIT in ALL, but not healthy control T cells. Compared to TIGIT cells, the TIGIT cells presented significantly higher PD-1 and Tim-3 expression directly ex vivo, and significantly lower IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNF-α after CD3/CD28 stimulation. The high inhibitory molecule and low cytokine expression signature was especially pronounced in ALL TIGIT CD4CD25 T cells and TIGIT CD8 T cells. Blocking TIGIT alone could minimally increase cytokine expression independent of PD-1 and Tim-3 blocking, whereas blocking TIGIT, PD-1, and Tim-3 altogether was significantly more effective. Together, these data demonstrated that TIGIT regulated T  function in adult ALL patients, and may serve as a treatment target for ALL.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The low PD-1/CTLA-4 positive rate and involvement of multiple immunosuppressive pathways are thought to be one of the reasons for treatment failure in non-responding patients. A new   molecule, HHLA2, which was widely expressed in PD-1 negative human tumors, may be a promising target for the improvement of recent  therapy. Yet, the prognostic value and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of HHLA2 remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic value and transcriptional regulation mechanism of HHLA2 according to clinical and experimental data from multiple databases, including cBioPortal, TCGA, Cistrome, TIMER, Oncomine, Kaplan-Meier, GeneXplain. It was found that the expression of HHLA2 was significantly elevated in renal tumors, and significantly decreased in colorectal tumors. Pan-cancer survival analysis indicates that HHLA2 was an independent prognostic factor in 9/20 of human cancers. Especially in renal clear  carcinoma ( = 3.0E-7). Through plotting survival curve in Kaplan-Meier Plotter, it was found that hypomethylation of HHLA2 DNA was a favorable prognostic factor for KIRC patients. Yet, the copy number variant of HHLA2 was not significantly correlated with the overall survival of KIRC patients. Finally, by analyzing the motif of HHLA2 co-expression genes, we identified 15 transcription factors that may be involved in the regulation of the HHLA2 co-expression network. Among these transcription factors, BATF in  lymphocyte and SMAD in monocyte were confirmed to be able to directly bind to HHLA2 DNA according to chip-seq experimental data from Cistrome database.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546897>Blockade of PD-L1 Enhances Cancer Immunotherapy by Regulating Dendritic  Maturation and Macrophage Polarization.</a></h2><p>The immuno-inhibitory  PD-L1, regulated by tumor cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs), dampened the activation of T cells from the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. PD-L1-expressing APCs rather than tumor cells demonstrated the essential anti-tumor effects of anti-PD-L1 monotherapy in preclinical tumor models. Using the murine tumor model, we investigated whether anti-PD-L1 antibody increased the antigen-specific  response and anti-tumor effects induced by the antigen-specific protein vaccine, as well as the possible mechanisms regarding activation of APCs. Anti-PD-L1 antibody combined with the PEK protein vaccine generated more potent E7-specific immunity (including the number and cytotoxic activity of E7-specific cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes) and anti-tumor effects than protein vaccine alone. Anti-PD-L1 antibody enhanced the maturation of dendritic cells and the proportion of M1-like macrophages in tumor-draining lymph nodes and tumors in tumor-bearing mice treated with combinatorial therapy. PD-L1 blockade overturned the immunosuppressive status of the tumor microenvironment and then enhanced the E7 tumor-specific antigen-specific immunity and anti-tumor effects generated by an E7-specific protein vaccine through modulation of APCs in an E7-expressing small tumor model. Tumor-specific antigen (like HPV E7 antigen)-specific immunotherapy combined with APC-targeting modality by PD-L1 blockade has a high translational potential in E7-specific cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511071>Niclosamide, an antihelmintic drug, enhances efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1   blockade in non-small  lung cancer.</a></h2><p>PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has received approval for clinical application due to its encouraging benefit with improving prognosis in selected populations. Unfortunately, the response to immunotherapy for many patients remains unsatisfactory. It remains a great challenge to generate potential combinations that will outperform single agents alone with regard to anti-tumor activity.Using NSCLC  lines and mouse models, we explored the effects of combined niclosamide and PD-L1 blockade on tumor growth and T  function. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between PD-L1 and p-STAT3 expression in tumor samples from patients with NSCLC using IHC, as well as their relationship to patient survival.In vitro, niclosamide, an antihelmintic drug, enhanced the cancer  lysis mediated by T cells in the presence of PD-L1 blockade. Accordingly, mice treated with niclosamide and PD-L1 antibody showed significant delay in tumor growth and increased survival which were associated with the increase of tumor infiltrating T cells and granzyme  release. Importantly, we found niclosamide could decrease the expression of PD-L1 in both a concentration- and time-dependent manner in NSCLC cells, which was linked to the blockage of p-STAT3 binding to the promoter of PD-L1.An enhancement of PD-L1 antibody by niclosamide was observed in inhibition of NSCLC growth in vitro and in vivo, which was involved in blockage of p-STAT3 binding to promoter of PD-L1 and finally downregulation of PD-L1 expression. These encourage the combination therapy of niclosamide and PD-1/PD-L1 blockade to be further studied in clinic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534232>Qualifying antibodies for image-based  profiling and multiplexed tissue imaging.</a></h2><p>Multiplexed tissue imaging enables precise, spatially resolved enumeration and characterization of  types and states in human resection specimens.

It is the only known ligand binding to a membrane receptor named receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa  (RANK), thereby triggering recruitment of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor (TRAF) adaptor proteins and activation of downstream pathways. RANK/RANKL signaling is controlled by a decoy receptor called osteoprotegerin (OPG), but also has additional more complex levels of regulation. The existing literature on RANK/RANKL signaling in cervical cancer was reviewed, particularly focusing on the effects on the microenvironment. RANKL and RANK are frequently co-expressed in cervical cancer cells lines and in carcinoma of the uterine cervix. RANKL and OPG expression strongly increases during cervical cancer progression. RANKL is directly secreted by cervical cancer cells, which may be a mechanism they use to create an  suppressive environment. RANKL induces expression of multiple activating cytokines by dendritic cells. High RANK mRNA levels and high immunohistochemical OPG expression are significantly correlated with high clinical stage, tumor grade, presence of lymph node metastases, and poor overall survival. Inhibition of RANKL signaling has a direct effect on tumor  proliferation and behavior, but also alters the microenvironment. Abundant circumstantial evidence suggests that RANKL inhibition may (partially) reverse an immunosuppressive status. The use of denosumab, a monoclonal antibody directed to RANKL, as an immunomodulatory strategy is an attractive concept which should be further explored in combination with  therapy in patients with cervical cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31229164>Noncellular  Therapies for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.</a></h2><p>Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) are a diverse group of diseases, encompassing mature -, T-, and natural killer  malignancies and ranging in behavior from indolent to highly aggressive.

This study aimed to investigate the safety and antitumour effects of pamiparib, an oral PARP 1/2 inhibitor, combined with tislelizumab, a humanised anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, in patients with advanced solid tumours and to determine the optimum doses for further evaluation.We did a multicentre, open-label, phase 1a/ study at five academic sites or community oncology centres in Australia. We recruited adults (aged ≥18 years) with advanced solid tumours who had received one or more previous lines of therapy, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 1 or less, and a life expectancy of 12 weeks or more. Patients were enrolled into one of five dose-escalation cohorts, with dose-escalation done in a 3 + 3 design. Cohorts 1-3 received intravenous tislelizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks plus 20, 40, or 60 mg oral pamiparib twice daily, respectively; cohorts 4 and 5 received 200 mg intravenous tislelizumab every 3 weeks plus 40 or 60 mg oral pamiparib twice daily, respectively. The primary endpoints of the phase 1a dose-escalation part of the study were safety and tolerability, including the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities and determination of the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose. All primary endpoints were analysed in the safety analysis set, which included all patients who received at least one dose of tislelizumab or pamiparib, with the exception of the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities, which was analysed in the dose-limiting toxicity analysis set, which included all patients who received at least 90% of the first scheduled tislelizumab dose and at least 75% of scheduled pamiparib doses, or who had a dose-limiting toxicity event during  1. Reported here are results of the phase 1a dose-escalation stage of the trial. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number , and is ongoing.Between Jan 22, 2016, and May 16, 2017, we enrolled 49 patients (median age 63 years [IQR 55-67]), all of whom received at least one dose of pamiparib or tiselzumab. Four patients had dose-limiting toxicities (intractable grade 2 nausea [n=1] and grade 3 rash [n=1] in cohort 4, and grade 2 nausea and vomiting [n=1] and grade 4 -mediated hepatitis [n=1] in cohort 5). The recommended phase 2 dose was tislelizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks plus pamiparib 40 mg twice daily (the dose given in cohort 4). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea (in 31 [63%] of 49 patients), fatigue (26 [53%]), diarrhoea (17 [35%]), and vomiting (15 [31%]). 23 (47%) of 49 patients had -related adverse events, of whom nine (39%) had asymptomatic grade 3-4 hepatic -related adverse events, which were reversible with corticosteroid treatment. The most common adverse event of grade 3 or worse severity was anaemia (in six [12%] patients) and no grade 5 adverse events were reported. Hepatitis or autoimmune hepatitis was the only serious adverse event to occur in two or more patients (in four [8%] patients). At a median follow-up of 8·3 months (IQR 4·8-12·8), ten (20%) of 49 patients achieved an objective response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1, including two complete responses and eight partial responses.Pamiparib with tislelizumab was generally well tolerated and associated with antitumour responses and clinical benefit in patients with advanced solid tumours supporting further investigation of the combination of pamiparib with tislelizumab.BeiGene.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the present study was to define robust TNBC subtypes with clinical relevance.Gene expression profiling by means of DNA chips was conducted in an internal TNBC cohort composed of 238 patients. In addition, external data (n = 257), obtained by using the same DNA chip, were used for validation. Fuzzy clustering was followed by functional annotation of the clusters. Immunohistochemistry was used to confirm transcriptomics results: CD138 and CD20 were used to test for plasma  and  lymphocyte infiltrations, respectively; MECA79 and CD31 for tertiary lymphoid structures; and UCHL1/PGP9.5 and S100 for neurogenesis.We identified three molecular clusters within TNBC: one molecular apocrine (C1) and two basal-like-enriched (C2 and C3). C2 presented pro-tumorigenic  response ( suppressive), high neurogenesis (nerve infiltration), and high biological aggressiveness. In contrast, C3 exhibited adaptive  response associated with complete   differentiation that occurs in tertiary lymphoid structures, and   upregulation. External cohort subtyping by means of the same approach proved the robustness of these results.

Recently, we newly identified structural variations(SVs)disrupting the 3'-untranslated region(UTR)of the PD- L1/PD-L2 genes in various cancers, which caused a marked upregulation of these molecules and mediated  escape of tumor cells. Particularly, these alterations were frequently observed in virus-related lymphomas, such as adult T- leukemia/ lymphoma as well as Epstein-Barr virus-positive diffuse large - lymphoma and extranodal NK/T- lymphoma. These results suggest a pivotal role of PD-L1/PD-L2-mediated  evasion in the pathogenesis of virus-related tumors. Here we summarize the genetic alterations involving the PD-L1/PD-L2 genes in human cancers, highlighting their relevance in virusassociated tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300044>Response to combined ipilimumab and nivolumab after development of a nephrotic syndrome related to PD-1 monotherapy.</a></h2><p>High response rates of metastatic melanoma have been reported upon   inhibition by PD-1 blockade alone or in combination with CTLA-4 inhibitors. However, the majority of patients with a primary resistance to anti-PD-1 monotherapy is also refractory to a subsequent combined  inhibition. In BRAF wildtype patients with a primary resistance to PD-1 inhibitors, therapeutic options are therefore limited and -related adverse events (irAE) have to be taken into consideration when discussing a subsequent immunotherapy.We report the case of a 68-year-old male patient with metastatic melanoma who experienced an acute renal failure with nephrotic syndrome due to a minimal change disease developing after a single dose of the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab. A kidney biopsy revealed a podocytopathy without signs of interstitial nephritis. Renal function recovered to almost normal creatinine and total urine protein levels upon treatment with oral steroids and diuretics. Unfortunately, a disease progression (PD, RECIST 1.1) was observed in a CT scan after resolution of the irAE. In a grand round, re-exposure to a PD-1-containing regime was recommended. Consensually, a combined immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab was initiated. Nephrotoxicity was tolerable during combined immunotherapy and a CT scan of chest and abdomen showed a deep partial remission (RECIST 1.1) after three doses of ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) and nivolumab (1 mg/kg).This case illustrates that a fulminant response to combined  inhibition is possible after progression after anti-PD-1 monotherapy and a severe irAE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665365>  Profiles in Luminal  Breast Cancer (Alliance).</a></h2><p>Unlike estrogen receptor (ER) negative breast cancer, ER-positive breast cancer outcome is less influenced by lymphocyte content indicating the presence of  tolerance mechanisms that may be specific to this disease subset.A supervised analysis of microarray data from the Alliance/ACOSOG Z1031 neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) trial identified upregulated genes in Luminal  breast cancers that correlated with AI-resistant tumor proliferation (Pearson's correlation r ≥ 0.4 with Ki67) (33 cases Ki67 >10% on AI) versus Luminal- breast cancers that were more AI-sensitive (33 cases Ki67 <10% on AI). Over-representation analysis was performed using Webgestalt.Thirty candidate genes positively correlated (r ≥ 0.4) with AI-resistant proliferation in Luminal  and were upregulated >2 fold. Gene ontologies identified that the targetable - components IDO1, LAG3, and PD1 were over-represented resistance candidates (p ≤ 0.001). High IDO1 mRNA associated with poor prognosis in luminal- disease (METABRIC, HR = 1.43, CI 1.04 - 1.98, p = 0.03). IDO1 also statistically significantly correlated with STAT1 at protein level in luminal- disease (Pearson's r = 0.74). As a composite  tolerance signature, expression of IFN-γ/STAT1 pathway components associated with higher baseline Ki67, lower estrogen and progesterone receptor mRNA levels and worse disease specific survival (p = 0.002). In a tissue microarray analysis (TMA), IDO1 was observed in stromal cells and tumor-associated macrophages, with a higher incidence in Luminal- cases. Furthermore, IDO1 expression associated with a macrophage mRNA signature (M1 by CIBERSORT Pearson's r = 0.62 ) and also by TMA analysis.Targetable - components are upregulated in majority of endocrine therapy resistant Luminal- cases.

Here, we aimed to assess and compare the utility of serum 5-S-CD and lactate dehydrogenase levels as markers for predicting the effects of nivolumab in advanced malignant melanoma.Baseline serum 5-S-CD and lactate dehydrogenase levels in patients with unresectable stage IIIC and IV malignant melanoma treated with nivolumab ( = 21) were analyzed to determine their utility as predictive markers for survival. We also analyzed the prognostic value of these markers among patients with only stage IV malignant melanoma ( = 17).Our analysis showed that patients with baseline serum 5-S-CD levels >25.0 nmol/L had significantly poor prognosis. In contrast, serum lactate dehydrogenase levels at the upper limit of the normal range did not exhibit such changes.Serum 5-S-CD levels have the potential to be an excellent predictive marker for the efficacy of nivolumab therapy in patients with advanced malignant melanoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31466401>Glycan-Modified Apoptotic Melanoma-Derived Extracellular Vesicles as Antigen Source for Anti-Tumor Vaccination</a></h2><p>Tumors that lack T  infiltration are less likely to respond to   inhibition and could benefit from cancer vaccination for the initiation of anti-tumor T  responses. An attractive vaccine strategy is in vivo targeting of dendritic cells (DCs), key initiators of antigen-specific T  responses. In this study we generated tumor-derived apoptotic extracellular vesicles (ApoEVs), which are potentially an abundant source of tumor-specific neo-antigens and other tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), and which can be manipulated to express DC-targeting ligands for efficient antigen delivery. Our data demonstrates that by specifically modifying the glycocalyx of tumor cells, high-mannose glycans can be expressed on their  surface and on extracellular vesicles derived after the induction of apoptosis. High-mannose glycans are the natural ligands of dendritic -specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), a dendritic  associated C-type lectin receptor (CLR), which has the ability to efficiently internalize its cargo and direct it to both major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I and MHC-II pathways for the induction of CD8 and CD4 T  responses, respectively. Compared to unmodified ApoEVs, ApoEVs carrying DC-SIGN ligands are internalized to a higher extent, resulting in enhanced priming of tumor-specific CD8 T cells. This approach thus presents a promising vaccination strategy in support of T -based immunotherapy of cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31286802>Which place for avelumab in the management of urothelial carcinoma?</a></h2><p>: Urothelial carcinoma (UC) has a poor prognosis, with the only standard first-line metastatic treatment being platinum-based chemotherapy. Until 2018, there was no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug for second-line setting, and only vinflunine was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) in Europe. However, targeting the programmed -death 1 (PD-1)/PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway with   inhibitor (ICI) agents has shown encouraging results. Avelumab is a human anti-PD-L1 antibody that is currently being investigated in several trials. : In this review article, we summarise preclinical, clinical, and safety data on avelumab for UC, and describeongoing trials that are evaluating avelumab for local or advanced diseases. We also compare its place in the management of UC. : Avelumab has shown clinical efficacy for metastatic and advanced UC in phase I studies after the failure of platinum-based therapy with a well-tolerated safety profile. This anti-PD-L1 targeting agent has the capacity to induce antibody-dependant cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)-mediated tumor  lysis compared to other ICI. These results led to FDA approval of avelumab as a second-line treatment for locally advanced and metastatic UC. Avelumab is also investigated in phase II and in a randomized phase III trial as a maintenance therapy in UC as well for combination use with chemotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511925>Desmoid tumors display a strong  infiltration at the tumor margins and no PD-L1-driven  suppression.</a></h2><p>Desmoid tumors (DTs) are local aggressive neoplasms, whose therapeutic approach has remained so far unsolved and in many instances controversial. Nowadays, immunotherapy appears to play a leading role in the treatment of various tumor types. Characterization of the tumor  microenvironment (TME) and   can possibly help identify new immunotherapeutic targets for DTs. We performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) on 33 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections from DT samples to characterize the TME and the   expression profile. We stained for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, FoxP3, CD45RO, CD56, CD68, NKp46, granzyme , CD27, CD70, PD1 and PD-L1. We investigated the expression of the markers in the tumoral stroma, as well as at the periphery of the tumor. We found that most of the tumors showed organization of lymphocytes into lymphoid aggregates at the periphery of the tumor, strongly resembling tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs). The tumor expressed a significant number of memory T cells, both at the periphery and in the tumoral stroma. In the lymphoid aggregates, we also recognized a significant proportion of regulatory T cells. The   ligand PD-L1 was negative on the tumor cells in almost all samples. On the other hand, PD1 was partially expressed in lymphocytes at the periphery of the tumor. To conclude, we are the first to show that DTs display a strong  infiltration at the tumor margins, with formation of lymphoid aggregates. Moreover, we demonstrated that there is no PD-L1-driven  suppression present in the tumor cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645894>Clinical outcomes in non-small- lung cancer patients receiving concurrent metformin and   inhibitors.</a></h2><p>To study the clinical benefits of concurrent metformin and   inhibitors (ICIs) in non-small- lung cancer patients.This is a retrospective review of 50 non-small- lung cancer patients receiving ICIs with metformin (cohort A) or without metformin (cohort ).

Yet, not all patients benefit as cancer  responsiveness (CIR) remains a limitation in a considerable proportion of cases. The multifactorial determinants of CIR include the genetic makeup of the patient, the genomic instability central to cancer development, the evolutionary emergence of cancer phenotypes under the influence of  editing, and external modifiers such as demographics, environment, treatment potency, co-morbidities and cancer-independent alterations including  homeostasis and polymorphisms in the major and minor histocompatibility molecules, cytokines, and chemokines. Based on the premise that cancer is fundamentally a disorder of the genes arising within a  biologic process, whose deviations from normality determine the rules of engagement with the host's response, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) convened a task force of experts from various disciplines including, immunology, oncology, biophysics, structural biology, molecular and cellular biology, genetics, and bioinformatics to address the complexity of CIR from a holistic view. The task force was launched by a workshop held in San Francisco on May 14-15, 2018 aimed at two preeminent goals: 1) to identify the fundamental questions related to CIR and 2) to create an interactive community of experts that could guide scientific and research priorities by forming a logical progression supported by multiple perspectives to uncover mechanisms of CIR. This workshop was a first step toward a second meeting where the focus would be to address the actionability of some of the questions identified by working groups. In this event, five working groups aimed at defining a path to test hypotheses according to their relevance to human cancer and identifying experimental models closest to human biology, which include: 1) Germline-Genetic, 2) Somatic-Genetic and 3) Genomic-Transcriptional contributions to CIR, 4) Determinant(s) of Immunogenic  Death that modulate CIR, and 5) Experimental Models that best represent CIR and its conversion to an  responsive state. This manuscript summarizes the contributions from each group and should be considered as a first milestone in the path toward a more contemporary understanding of CIR. We appreciate that this effort is far from comprehensive and that other relevant aspects related to CIR such as the microbiome, the individual's recombined T  and   receptors, and the metabolic status of cancer and  cells were not fully included. These and other important factors will be included in future activities of the taskforce. The taskforce will focus on prioritization and specific actionable approach to answer the identified questions and implementing the collaborations in the follow-up workshop, which will be held in Houston on September 4-5, 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31090764>Recent progress in nanomaterials for nucleic acid delivery in cancer immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>The combination of gene therapy and immunotherapy has the potential to systemically promote anti-tumor effects while reducing adverse reactions.

A lymphocytic reaction observed by pathological examination is a manifestation of the host  response to tumour cells. It was hypothesized that a stronger lymphocytic reaction to tumours might be associated with favourable prognosis in oesophageal cancer.Using a database of resected oesophageal cancers, four morphological components of lymphocytic reactions (peritumoral, intranest, lymphoid and stromal) to tumours were evaluated in relation to clinical outcome, PD-1 expression by immunohistochemistry and total lymphocyte count in blood.Resected oesophageal cancer specimens from 436 patients were included in the study. Among the four morphological components, only peritumoral reaction was associated with patient prognosis (multivariable P for trend <0·001); patients with a higher peritumoral reaction had significantly longer overall survival than those with a lower reaction (multivariable hazard ratio 0·48, 95 per cent c.i. 0·34 to 0·67). The prognostic effect of peritumoral reaction was not significantly modified by other clinical variables (all P for interaction >0·050). Peritumoral reaction was associated with total lymphocyte count in the blood (P < 0·001), supporting the relationship between local  response and systemic  competence. In addition, higher morphological peritumoral reaction was associated with high PD-1 expression on lymphocytes in tumours (P = 0·034).These findings should help to improve risk-adapted therapeutic strategies and help stratify patients in the future clinical setting of immunotherapy for oesophageal cancer.© 2019 BJS Society Ltd Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31413922>Characterization of the tumor  micromilieu and its interference with outcome after concurrent chemoradiation in patients with oropharyngeal carcinomas.</a></h2><p>Intra-tumoral CD8 + T- infiltration in squamous  carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) has previously been linked to the efficacy of cisplatin-based chemoradiation (CDDP-CRTX) and   inhibitor (ICI) monotherapy. Further detailed characterization of the tumor -micromilieu and its influence on outcome may guide the development of CRTX-ICI combinations.Comprehensive  transcriptome analysis was applied to a training set of tumor specimens from oropharyngeal squamous  carcinoma (OPSCC) patients treated with CDDP-CRTX in the ARO-0401 phase III study (n = 33). A composite  signature risk score (ISRS) for survival prediction was developed, and subsequently validated in two independent OPSCC cohorts treated with either CDDP-CRTX (n = 36) or mitomycin-based CRTX (MMC-CRTX, n = 31). Further validation of the ISRS was performed in the OPSCC subset (n = 79) of the TCGA HNSCC cohort. Potential interference between  signatures and HPV status was evaluated in multivariate Cox regression models.Significant differences according to the 3-y OS status in the abundance of tumor-infiltrating T- and -cells, and the expression levels of 51 -related genes were observed. A risk score based on 13 differentially expressed genes involved in cytokine signaling, T- effector functions and the TNFR pathway was established as robust predictive factor of OS. Its predictive power was superior to the 6-gene interferon-gamma signature of ICI efficacy and independent of the HPV status.This study further elucidates the complex interaction of the tumor  microenvironment with the efficacy of CDDP-CRTX in OPSCC.

Furthermore, the management of both small and large vessel vasculitis is challenging because of a lack of robust markers of disease activity. Recent research has advanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of both small and large vessel vasculitis, and this has led to the development of novel biologic therapies capable of targeting key cytokine and cellular effectors of the inflammatory cascade. In parallel, a diverse range of imaging modalities with the potential to monitor vessel inflammation are emerging. Continued expansion of combined structural and molecular imaging using positron emission tomography with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging may soon provide reliable longitudinal tracking of vascular inflammation.

Cancer vaccines have been used for many decades and have shown some promise but overall relatively modest clinical activity across cancers. Technological advances in genome sequencing capabilities and T- engineering have had substantial impact on both adoptive  therapy and the cancer vaccine field. The ability to identify neoantigens-a class of tumor antigens that is truly tumor specific and encoded by tumor mutations through rapid and relatively inexpensive next-generation sequencing-has already demonstrated the critical importance of these antigens as targets of antitumor-specific T- responses in the context of   blockade and other immunotherapies. Therapeutically targeting these antigens with either adoptive T- therapy or vaccine approaches has demonstrated early promise in the clinic in patients with advanced solid tumors. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, which are engineered by fusing an antigen-specific, single-chain antibody (scFv) with signaling molecules of the T- receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex creating an antibody-like structure on T cells that recognizes antigens independently of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, have demonstrated remarkable clinical activity in patients with advanced - malignancies, leading to several approvals by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31355495>T  receptor-based cancer immunotherapy: Emerging efficacy and pathways of resistance.</a></h2><p>Adoptive  transfer (ACT) using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells can induce durable remissions in patients with refractory -lymphoid cancers. By contrast, results applying CAR-modified T cells to solid malignancies have been comparatively modest. Alternative strategies to redirect T  specificity and cytolytic function are therefore necessary if ACT is to serve a greater role in human cancer treatments. T  receptors (TCRs) are antigen recognition structures physiologically expressed by all T cells that have complementary, and in some cases superior, properties to CARs. Unlike CARs, TCRs confer recognition to epitopes derived from proteins residing within any subcellular compartment, including the membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus. This enables TCRs to detect a broad universe of targets, such as neoantigens, cancer germline antigens, and viral oncoproteins. Moreover, because TCRs have evolved to efficiently detect and amplify antigenic signals, these receptors respond to epitope densities many fold smaller than required for CAR-signaling. Herein, we summarize recent clinical data demonstrating that TCR-based immunotherapies can mediate regression of solid malignancies, including - inhibitor refractory cancers. These trials simultaneously highlight emerging mechanisms of TCR resistance. We conclude by discussing how TCR-based immunotherapies can achieve broader dissemination through innovations in  manufacturing and non-viral genome integration techniques.© 2019 The Authors.

These heterogeneities may lead to unexpected results among clinical trials. : In this review, we address the heterogeneity noted in early phase HCC trials, trials involving transarterial chemoembolization, and advanced HCC trials. Furthermore, we discuss possible methods to attenuate the detrimental effects of heterogeneity when conducting clinical trials. : Clinical trials in HCC exhibit an inherently high degree of heterogeneity because of various reasons: tumor heterogeneity, different cirrhotic backgrounds, various etiologies of cirrhosis, and geographical differences in practice and expertise. Such heterogeneity may cause imbalance among the enrolled patient population, premature withdrawal from the clinical trial, and variable response to the treatment. In addition, methodological heterogeneity also exists in designing trial protocol and response evaluation. All these factors may eventually lead to conflicting results among clinical trials. Accounting for these heterogeneities is important to foster the success of future trials. In recent years, significant progress with molecular targeted agents and   inhibitors was made in advanced HCC. These new agents are also being tested in clinical trials involving earlier stage HCC and will also face the challenge of these issues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624262>Targeting the mTOR pathway uncouples the efficacy and toxicity of PD-1 blockade in renal transplantation.</a></h2><p>  inhibitor (ICI) use remains a challenge in patients with solid organ allografts as most would undergo rejection. In a melanoma patient in whom programmed-death 1 (PD-1) blockade resulted in organ rejection and colitis, the addition of the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus resulted in ongoing anti-tumor efficacy while promoting allograft tolerance. Strong granzyme , interferon (IFN)-γ CD8 cytotoxic T  and circulating regulatory T (T)  responses were noted during allograft rejection, along with significant eosinophilia and elevated serum IL-5 and eotaxin levels. Co-treatment with sirolimus abated cytotoxic T  numbers and eosinophilia, while elevated T  numbers in the peripheral blood were maintained. Interestingly, numbers of IFN-γ CD4 T cells and serum IFN-γ levels increased with the addition of sirolimus treatment likely promoting ongoing anti-PD-1 efficacy. Thus, our results indicate that sirolimus has the potential to uncouple anti-PD-1 therapy toxicity and efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31439937>A global view of hepatocellular carcinoma: trends, risk, prevention and management.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Risk factors for HCC include chronic hepatitis  and hepatitis C, alcohol addiction, metabolic liver disease (particularly nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) and exposure to dietary toxins such as aflatoxins and aristolochic acid. All these risk factors are potentially preventable, highlighting the considerable potential of risk prevention for decreasing the global burden of HCC. HCC surveillance and early detection increase the chance of potentially curative treatment; however, HCC surveillance is substantially underutilized, even in countries with sufficient medical resources. Early-stage HCC can be treated curatively by local ablation, surgical resection or liver transplantation. Treatment selection depends on tumour characteristics, the severity of underlying liver dysfunction, age, other medical comorbidities, and available medical resources and local expertise. Catheter-based locoregional treatment is used in patients with intermediate-stage cancer. Kinase and   inhibitors have been shown to be effective treatment options in patients with advanced-stage HCC. Together, rational deployment of prevention, attainment of global goals for viral hepatitis eradication, and improvements in HCC surveillance and therapy hold promise for achieving a substantial reduction in the worldwide HCC burden within the next few decades.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501270>Workup and Management of -Mediated Hepatobiliary Pancreatic Toxicities That Develop During   Inhibitor Treatment.</a></h2><p>  inhibitor treatment has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of a wide range of cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma. Workup and management of -mediated hepatitis, pancreatitis, or cholangitis that develops during   inhibitor treatment can be challenging. -mediated hepatitis can be particularly challenging if patients have underlying viral hepatitis or autoimmune hepatitis. Patients with positive hepatitis  virus DNA should be referred to a hepatologist for antiviral therapy prior to   inhibitor treatment. With untreated hepatitis C virus (HCV) and elevated liver enzymes, a liver biopsy should be obtained to differentiate between HCV infection and -mediated hepatitis due to anti-programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy. If autoimmune serologies are negative, then this supports a case of -mediated hepatitis secondary to anti-PD-1 therapy, rather than autoimmune hepatitis. In this case, an empiric steroid therapy is reasonable; however, if the patient does not respond to steroid therapy in 3-5 days, then liver biopsy should be pursued. The incidence of  -induced pancreatitis is low, but when it does occur, diagnosis is not straightforward. Although routine monitoring of pancreatic enzymes is not generally recommended, when pancreatitis is suspected, serum levels of amylase and lipase should be checked. Once confirmed, a steroid or other immunosuppressant (if steroids are contraindicated) should be administered along with close monitoring, and a slow tapering dosage once the pancreatitis is under control. Patients should then be monitored for recurrent pancreatitis. Finally,  therapy-related cholangitis involves elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase and, once diagnosed, is managed in the same way as -mediated hepatitis. KEY POINTS: -mediated hepatitis, pancreatitis, and cholangitis are found in patients receiving or who have previously received   inhibitors.To work up -mediated hepatitis, viral, and autoimmune serologies, liver imaging will help to differentiate -mediated hepatitis from hepatitis of other etiology.Hepatology consult may be considered in patients with a history of chronic liver disease who developed hepatitis during   inhibitor treatment.Liver biopsy should be considered to clarify the diagnosis for case in which the hepatitis is refractory to steroid or immunosuppressant treatment.-mediated pancreatitis is treated with steroid or other immunosuppressant with a slow tapering and should be monitored for recurrence. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: All patient receiving or who have previously received   inhibitors should be monitored closely for -mediated hepatitis, pancreatitis, and cholangitis. Workup and management of -mediated hepatitis, pancreatitis, and cholangitis should follow the package insert of   inhibitors. Hepatology consultation should be considered in patients with a history of chronic liver disease.© AlphaMed Press 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195619>HBV -Therapy: From Molecular Mechanisms to Clinical Applications.</a></h2><p>Chronic hepatitis  virus (HBV) infection represents a worldwide public health concern with approximately 250 million people chronically infected and at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUC) are the most widely used therapies for HBV infection, but they often require long-lasting administration to avoid the risk of HBV reactivation at withdrawal. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel treatments to shorten the duration of NUC therapy by accelerating virus control, and to complement the effect of available anti-viral therapies. In chronic HBV infection, virus-specific T cells are functionally defective, and this exhaustion state is a key determinant of virus persistence. Reconstitution of an efficient anti-viral T  response may thus represent a rational strategy to treat chronic HBV patients. In this perspective, the enhancement of adaptive  responses by a  inhibitor blockade, specific T  vaccines, lymphocyte metabolism targeting, and autologous T  engineering, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and TCR-redirected T cells, constitutes a promising  modulatory approach for a therapeutic restoration of protective immunity. The advances of the emerging -based therapies in the setting of the HBV research field will be outlined.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31071366>Glycolytic activation of peritumoral monocytes fosters  privilege via the PFKFB3-PD-L1 axis in human hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Programmed  death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on antigen-presenting cells is essential for T  impairment, and PD-L1-expressing macrophages may mechanistically shape and therapeutically predict the clinical efficacy of PD-L1 or programmed  death 1 blockade. We aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying PD-L1 upregulation in human tumor microenvironments, which remain poorly understood despite the clinical success of   inhibitors.Monocytes/macrophages were purified from peripheral blood, non-tumor, or paired tumor tissues of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and their possible glycolytic switch was evaluated. The underlying regulatory mechanisms and clinical significance of metabolic switching were studied with both ex vivo analyses and in vitro experiments.We found that monocytes significantly enhanced the levels of glycolysis at the peritumoral region of human HCC. The activation of glycolysis induced PD-L1 expression on these cells and subsequently attenuated cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in tumor tissues. Mechanistically, tumor-derived soluble factors, including hyaluronan fragments, induced the upregulation of a key glycolytic enzyme, PFKFB3, in tumor-associated monocytes. This enzyme not only modulated the cellular metabolic switch but also mediated the increased expression of PD-L1 by activating the nuclear factor kappa  signaling pathway in these cells. Consistently, the levels of PFKFB3CD68  infiltration in peritumoral tissues were negatively correlated with overall survival and could serve as an independent prognostic factor for survival in patients with HCC.Our results reveal a mechanism by which the cellular metabolic switch regulates the pro-tumor functions of monocytes in a specific human tumor microenvironment. PFKFB3 in both cancer cells and tumor-associated monocytes is a potential therapeutic target in human HCC.Programmed  death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressed on antigen-presenting cells, rather than tumor cells, has been reported to play an essential role in  blockade therapy. A fundamental understanding of mechanisms that regulate the expression of PD-L1 on tumor-infiltrating monocytes/macrophages will undoubtedly lead to the possibility of developing novel PD-L1 blockade strategies with high specificity and efficiency. The current study unveils a novel mechanism by which metabolic switching links  activation responses to  tolerance in the tumor milieu, identifying potential targets for future -based anti-cancer therapies.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

However, most patients do not benefit. Therefore, biomarkers are needed that accurately predict response. We hypothesized that molecular profiling of exhaled air may capture the inflammatory milieu related to the individual responsiveness to anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1) therapy. This study aimed to determine the accuracy of exhaled breath analysis at baseline for assessing nonresponders versus responders to anti-PD-1 therapy in NSCLC patients.This was a prospective observational study in patients receiving  inhibitor therapy using both a training and validation set of NSCLC patients. At baseline, breath profiles were collected in duplicate by a metal oxide semiconductor electronic nose (eNose) positioned at the rear end of a pneumotachograph. Patients received nivolumab or pembrolizumab of which the efficacy was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 at 3-month follow-up. Data analysis involved advanced signal-processing and statistics based on independent t-tests followed by linear discriminant and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.Exhaled breath data of 143 NSCLC patients (training: 92, validation: 51) were available at baseline. ENose sensors contributed significantly (P < 0.05) at baseline in differentiating between patients with different responses at 3 months of anti-PD-1 treatment. The eNose sensors were combined into a single biomarker with an ROC-area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89 [confidence interval (CI) 0.82-0.96]. This AUC was confirmed in the validation set: 0.85 (CI 0.75-0.96).ENose assessment was effective in the noninvasive prediction of individual patient responses to immunotherapy. The predictive accuracy and efficacy of the eNose for discrimination of immunotherapy responder types were replicated in an independent validation set op patients. This finding can potentially avoid application of ineffective treatment in identified probable nonresponders.© The Author(s) 2019.

We developed an improved humanized mouse model, derived from fresh cord blood CD34 stem cells (CD34 HSC), and combined it with lung cancer  line-derived human xenografts or patient-derived xenografts (Hu-PDX). Fresh CD34 HSCs could reconstitute detectable mature human leukocytes (hCD45) in mice at four weeks without the onset of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Repopulated human T cells,  cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DC), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) increased in peripheral blood, spleen, and bone marrow over time. Although cultured CD34 HSCs labeled with luciferase could be detected in mice, the cultured HSCs did not develop into mature human  cells by four weeks, unlike fresh CD34 HSCs. , reconstituted T cells, obtained from the tumor-bearing humanized mice, secreted IFNγ upon treatment with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or exposure to human A549 lung tumor cells and mediated antigen-specific CTL responses, indicating functional activity. Growth of engrafted PDXs and tumor xenografts was not dependent on the human leukocyte antigen status of the donor. Treatment with the anti-PD-1  inhibitors pembrolizumab or nivolumab inhibited tumor growth in humanized mice significantly, and correlated with an increased number of CTLs and decreased MDSCs, regardless of the donor HLA type. In conclusion, fresh CD34HSCs are more effective than their expanded counterparts in humanizing mice, and do so in a shorter time.

A Position Paper from UM Cure 2020.</a></h2><p>Despite much progress in our understanding of uveal melanoma (UM) over the past decades, this rare tumour is still often misclassified. Although UM, like other melanomas, is very probably derived from melanocytes, it is drastically different from cutaneous melanoma and most other melanoma subtypes in terms of epidemiology, aetiology, biology and clinical features, including an intriguing metastatic hepatotropism. UM carries distinctive prognostic chromosome alterations, somatic mutations and gene expression profiles, allowing an active tailored surveillance strategy and dedicated adjuvant clinical trials. There is no standard systemic treatment for disseminated UM at present. In contrast to cutaneous melanoma, UMs are not -mutated, thus curtailing the use of -Raf inhibitors. Although these tumours are characterised by some  infiltrates,   inhibitors are rarely effective, possibly due to a low mutation burden. UM patients across the world not only face rare cancer-related issues (e.g., specific management strategies, access to information and to expert centres), but also specific UM problems, which can be exacerbated by the common misconception that it is a subtype of cutaneous melanoma.

Risk scores assigned based on expression of these genes were validated by Kaplan–Meier and multivariable Cox analyses in the remaining datasets and in important clinical subsets. High-risk patients had shorter overall survival and, in some cases, progression-free survival than low-risk patients. Additionally, expression of programmed  death 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), as well as several other important   genes, differed between high-risk and low-risk patients, as did the proportions of various -infiltrating cells.

The key drugs are   inhibitors (CPIs), whose mechanism of action is to elicit  response against cancer  antigens. Three types of CPIs are currently used and approved: an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, ipilimumab; anti-PD-1 antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab; and anti-PD-L1 antibodies: atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab. CPIs have been widely used in metastatic and adjuvant melanoma settings, metastatic lung cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, renal cancer, bladder cancer, head and neck tumours, and Merkel  carcinoma. However, side effects of CPIs differ from toxicities of other oncological drugs. According to literature data, in 10-30% of patients CPIs are responsible for -related adverse events (irAE) associated with excessive activation of the  system. Systemic irAEs include enterocolitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, nephritis, hypophysitis, and autoimmune thyroid disease. However, the most common irAEs of  inhibitors are dermatologic toxicities ranging from pruritus and mild dermatoses to severe reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.

Although some extranodal NK/T- lymphoma patients have shown responses to   blockade, biomarkers for predicting extranodal NK/T- lymphoma patient response to immunotherapy have not yet been defined. To understand the tumor  microenvironment, we analyzed the expression of 579 -related genes and characterized the  cells using immunohistochemistries and in situ hybridization for EBER. Based on comprehensive analyses, we developed an  subtyping model that classifies extranodal NK/T- lymphoma patients into four tumor  microenvironment subgroups using three immunohistochemical markers (FoxP3, PD-L1, and CD68). The four tumor  microenvironment subgroups were named  tolerance,  evasion-A,  evasion-, and  silenced. The  tolerance group was characterized by high-Treg counts and was frequently observed in early stage, and nasal extranodal NK/T- lymphoma. The  evasion group showed high cytotoxic T- counts and high PD-L1 expression but low Treg counts. In the -silenced group, almost all  responses were exhausted, most patients were at an advanced stage, and had the poorest disease prognosis among the tumor  microenvironment subgroups. In some patients (n = 3), a shift in the tumor  microenvironment subgroup classification was observed in sequential biopsies. The response rate to pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, was 100% (1/1) in the  tolerance group, 60% (3/5) in the  evasion group, and 0% (0/5) in the -silenced group. We classified extranodal NK/T- lymphoma into four tumor  microenvironment subgroups using a new classification system. In conclusion, we propose that the tumor  microenvironment of extranodal NK/T- lymphoma may change during disease progression and may serve as a useful biomarker for immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31332390>A case report of clonal EBV-like memory CD4 T  activation in fatal  inhibitor-induced encephalitis.</a></h2><p> inhibitors produce durable responses in numerous metastatic cancers, but -related adverse events (irAEs) complicate and limit their benefit. IrAEs can affect organ systems idiosyncratically; presentations range from mild and self-limited to fulminant and fatal. The molecular mechanisms underlying irAEs are poorly understood. Here, we report a fatal case of encephalitis arising during anti-programmed  death receptor 1 therapy in a patient with metastatic melanoma.

We identified 209 reported cases in global pharmacovigilance databases (across multiple cancer types) of encephalitis associated with  inhibitor regimens, with a 19% fatality rate. We performed further analyses from the index case and two additional cases to shed light on this recurrent and fulminant irAE. Spatial and multi-omic analyses pinpointed activated memory CD4 T cells as highly enriched in the inflamed, affected region. We identified a highly oligoclonal T  receptor repertoire, which we localized to activated memory cytotoxic (CD45ROGZMBKi67) CD4 cells.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been implicated in regulating complex cellular mechanisms to influence tumor biology and immunogenicity in various types of cancer. The potential of selective inhibition of HDAC6 has been widely discussed for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. We previously identified that MPT0G612 is a novel HDAC6 inhibitor exhibiting a promising antitumor activity against several solid tumors. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility and pharmacological mechanisms of MPT0G612 as a potential therapy for CRC patients. Results revealed that MPT0G612 significantly suppresses the proliferation and viability, as well as induces apoptosis in CRC cells. Autophagy activation with LC3B-II formation and p62 degradation was observed, and the inhibition of autophagy by pharmacological inhibitor or Atg5 knockdown enhances MPT0G612-induced  death. In addition, HDAC6 knockdown reduces MPT0G612-mediated autophagy and further potentiates apoptotic  death. Furthermore, MPT0G612 downregulates the expression of PD-L1 induced by IFN-γ in CRC cells. These results suggest that MPT0G612 is a potent  death inducer through inhibiting HDAC6-associated pathway, and a potential agent for combination strategy with   inhibitors for the treatment of CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31544840>Investigational Monoclonal Antibodies in the Treatment of Multiple Myeloma: A Systematic Review of Agents under Clinical Development.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy for multiple myeloma (MM) has been the focus in recent years due to its myeloma-specific  responses.

We investigated the correlation between F-FDG PET/CT-based markers and tumour tissue expression of PD-L1, necrosis and clinical outcome in patients receiving  inhibitor treatment.PD-Li expression in biopsy or resection specimens from 49 patients with confirmed NSCLC was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), mean SUV (SUVmean), metabolic tumour volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were obtained from F-FDG PET/CT images. The ratio of metabolic to morphological lesion volumes (MMVR) and its association with PD-L1 expression in each lesion were calculated. The associations between histologically reported necrosis and F-FDG PET imaging patterns and radiological outcome (evaluated by iRECIST) following anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy were also analysed. In 14 patients, the association between necrosis and MMVR and tumour  contexture were analysed by multiple immunofluorescent (IF) staining for CD8, PD-1, granzyme  (GrzB) and NFATC2.In total, 25 adenocarcinomas and 24 squamous  carcinomas were analysed. All tumours showed metabolic F-FDG PET uptake. MMVR was correlated inversely with PD-L1 expression in tumour cells. Furthermore, PD-L1 expression and low MMVR were significantly correlated with clinical benefit. Necrosis was correlated negatively with MMVR. Multiplex IF staining showed a greater frequency of activated CD8 cells in necrotic tumours than in nonnecrotic tumours in both stromal and epithelial tumour compartments.This study introduces MMVR as a new imaging biomarker and its ability to noninvasively capture increased PD-L1 tumour expression and predict clinical benefit from  blockade in NSCLC should be further evaluated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312647>Immunotherapy: Pancreatic Cancer and Extrahepatic Biliary Tract Cancer.</a></h2><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and extrahepatic biliary tract cancer (BTC) are among the malignancies with the highest morbidity and mortality.

Classical auto- side effects of these treatments, often called -related adverse events (irAEs), can affect multiple organs, including the lungs in which potentially life-threatening pneumonitis may require rapid treatment with high doses of corticosteroids. Nevertheless, the occurrence of severe infections in cancer patients treated with nivolumab, outside the context of immunosuppressive therapy, is a complication that has rarely been reported in the literature.  We report two cases of severe pulmonary infection with unusual microbes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Aspergillus fumigatus, in patients treated with nivolumab for non-small  lung cancer.  Ruling out pulmonary infections may require extensive investigation, as these may have an atypical presentation due to immunomodulation. Furthermore, treating the patient with corticosteroids for -related pneumonia could lead to a fatal outcome in this context. This report highlights the importance of excluding the presence of opportunistic infections and tuberculosis before considering -related pulmonary toxicity with or without a history of prior corticosteroid use. These cases also emphasize the potential value of tuberculosis screening in patients treated with PD-1  inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31159588>Microtubule-targeting agents in the treatment of non-small  lung cancer: insights on new combination strategies and investigational compounds.</a></h2><p>The management of non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) has been substantially improved in the last few years; it has been revolutionized by a patient-tailored approach, especially in the oncogene addicted disease, and by novel combinations containing   inhibitors. However, chemotherapy still represents a mainstay that persists over the decades with limited novelties. Tubulin inhibitors belong to different sub-classes of drugs that share the capability to interfere with mitosis by a direct action on the microtubule system. Among them, taxanes and vinca alkaloids still have a prominent role in clinical practice.This review summarizes the mechanisms of action, current role and future directions of microtubule targeting agents; we focus on investigational agents in phase I and II clinical trials.Chemotherapy maintains a pivotal role in the treatment of NSCLC. New generation agents that have the potential to overcome the mechanisms of resistance to the available drugs may provide new therapeutic opportunities. Predictive biomarkers derived from combination strategies and phase III studies are necessary going forward.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336685>PD-1/PD-L1 Targeting in Breast Cancer: The First Clinical Evidences Are Emerging. A Literature Review.</a></h2><p>Recently, the development of immunotherapy through the   blockade led to long-lasting responses in several types of cancers that are refractory to conventional treatments, such as melanoma or non-small  lung cancer. Immunotherapy has also demonstrated significant improvements in various other types of cancers. However, breast cancer remains one of the tumors that have not experienced the explosion of immunotherapy yet. Indeed, breast cancer was traditionally considered as being weakly immunogenic with a lower mutational load compared to other tumor types. In the last few years, anti-PD1/PD-L1 (Programmed death-ligand 1) agents have been evaluated in breast cancer, particularly in the triple negative subtype, with promising results observed when delivered as monotherapy or in combination with conventional treatments. In this review, we will report the results of the most recent studies evaluating   inhibitors in breast cancer. In addition, we will discuss the concomitant development of possible biomarkers, which is required for improving the selection of patients with the highest probability of benefiting from these agents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672768>How to Train your T cells: Overcoming  Dysfunction in Multiple Myeloma.</a></h2><p>The progression of multiple myeloma (MM), a hematologic malignancy characterized by unregulated plasma  growth, is associated with increasing innate and adaptive  system dysfunction, notably in the T- repertoire. Although treatment advances in MM have led to deeper and more durable clinical responses, the disease remains incurable for most patients. Therapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and activating the host  system have recently shown promise in MM, particularly in the relapsed and/or refractory disease setting. As the efficacy of T--dependent immuno-oncology therapy is likely affected by the health of the endogenous T- repertoire, these therapies may also provide benefit in alternate treatment settings (e.g., precursor disease; after stem  transplantation). This review describes T--associated changes during the evolution of MM and provides an overview of T--dependent immuno-oncology approaches under investigation. Vaccine and  inhibitor interventions are being explored across the MM disease continuum; treatment modalities that redirect patient T cells to elicit an anti-MM response, namely chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and bispecific antibodies (including BiTE [bispecific T- engager] molecules), have been primarily evaluated to date in the relapsed and/or refractory disease setting. CAR T cells and bispecific antibodies/antibody constructs directed against - maturation antigen (BCMA) have generated excitement, with clinical data demonstrating deep responses. An increased understanding of the complex interplay between the  system and MM throughout the disease course will aid in maximizing the potential for T--dependent immuno-oncology strategies in MM.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p></html>
