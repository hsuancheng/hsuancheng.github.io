HF diets were supplemented with ALA, EPA, or DHA (1% w/w) and given to C57BL/6J mice for 16 weeks and to Ob/Ob mice for 6 weeks. In C57BL/6J mice, EPA reduced plasma cholesterol (-20%), limited fat mass accumulation (-23%) and adipose cell hypertrophy (-50%), and reduced plasma leptin concentration (-60%) compared with HF-fed mice. Furthermore, mice supplemented with EPA exhibited a higher insulin sensitivity (+24%) and glucose tolerance (+20%) compared with HF-fed mice. Similar effects were observed in EPA-supplemented Ob/Ob mice, although fat mass accumulation was not prevented. By contrast, in comparison with HF-fed mice, DHA did not prevent fat mass accumulation, increased plasma leptin concentration (+128%) in C57BL/6J mice, and did not improve glucose homeostasis in C57BL/6J and Ob/Ob mice. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, DHA stimulated leptin expression whereas EPA induced adiponectin expression, suggesting that improved leptin/adiponectin balance may contribute to the protective effect of EPA. In conclusion, supplementation with EPA, but not ALA and DHA, could preserve glucose homeostasis in an obesogenic environment and limit fat mass accumulation in the early stage of weight gain.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28128380>Effects of rosa mosqueta oil supplementation in lipogenic markers associated with prevention of liver steatosis.</a></h1><p>Rosa mosqueta (RM) oil is rich in α- (ALA) - a precursor of eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), and it has a high antioxidant activity due to its abundant content of tocopherols. Additionally, it has been observed that RM oil administration prevents hepatic steatosis. Thus, the aim of this study was to demonstrate the antilipogenic mechanism related to RM oil administration in a high-fat diet (HFD) fed mice model by evaluating markers associated with the regulation of lipid droplet metabolism (PLIN2, PLIN5 and PPAR-γ), and proteins associated with  (FAS and SREBP-1c). C57BL/6J mice were fed either a control diet or a HFD, with and without RM oil supplementation for 12 weeks. The results showed that RM oil supplementation decreases hepatic PLIN2 and PPAR-γ mRNA expression and SREBP-1c, FAS and PLIN2 protein levels, whereas we did not find changes in the level of PLIN5 among the groups. These results suggest that modulation of lipogenic markers could be one of the mechanisms, through which RM oil supplementation prevents the hepatic steatosis induced by HFD consumption in a mice model.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27253325>Effects of Addition of Linseed and Marine Algae to the Diet on Adipose Tissue Development, Fatty  Profile, Lipogenic Gene Expression, and Meat Quality in Lambs.</a></h1><p>This study examined the effect of linseed and algae on growth and carcass parameters, adipocyte cellularity, fatty  profile and meat quality and gene expression in subcutaneous and intramuscular adipose tissues (AT) in lambs. After weaning, 33 lambs were fed three diets up to 26.7 ± 0.3 kg: Control diet (barley and soybean); L diet (barley, soybean and 10% linseed) and L-A diet (barley, soybean, 5% linseed and 3.89% algae). Lambs fed L-A diet showed lower average daily gain and greater slaughter age compared to Control and L (P < 0.001). Carcass traits were not affected by L and L-A diets, but a trend towards greater adipocyte diameter was observed in L and L-A in the subcutaneous AT (P = 0.057). Adding either linseed or linseed and algae increased α- and eicosapentaenoic  contents in both AT (P < 0.001); however, docosahexaenoic  was increased by L-A (P < 0.001). The n-6/n-3 ratio decreased in L and L-A (P < 0.001). Algae had adverse effects on meat quality, with greater lipid oxidation and reduced ratings for odor and flavor. The expression of lipogenic genes was downregulated in the subcutaneous AT (P < 0.05): acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACACA) in L and L-A and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) in L-A. Fatty  desaturase 1 (FADS1), fatty  desaturase 2 (FADS2) and fatty  elongase 5 (ELOVL5) were unaffected. In the subcutaneous AT, supplementing either L or L-A increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) and CAAT-enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPA) (P < 0.05), although it had no effect on sterol regulatory element-binding factor 1 (SREBF1). In the intramuscular AT, expression of ACACA, SCD, FADS1 and FADS2 decreased in L and L-A (P < 0.001) and LPL in L (P < 0.01), but PPARG, CEBPA and SREBF1 were unaffected.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29115671>Fatty  elongase7 is regulated via SP1 and is involved in lipid accumulation in bovine mammary epithelial cells.</a></h1><p>Fatty  Elongase 7 (ELOVL7) is the newly discovered protein on human that catalyzes the rate-limiting step towards the synthesis of very long-chain fatty acids and exhibits the highest activity toward C18: 3 (n-3) acyl-CoAs, which is the precursor of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, 20: 5n-3). However, in ruminants, an overall understanding of ELOVLs gene family and the transcriptional regulation of ELOVL7 remain unknown. The purpose of this study is to investigate the transcriptional regulation and the influence of bovine ELOVL7 in bovine mammary epithelial cells (bMECs). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that ELOVLs gene family had differential expression patterns in bMECs, and bovine ELOVL7 was expressed in a tissue-specific manner, which was high in kidney, followed by in abdominal fat and in bMECs. Promoter analysis of bovine ELOVL7, including bioinformatics analyzes, dual-luciferase reporter assays, protein pull-down assay, Western blot assay, over-expression and RNA interference assay, have independently and synthetically demonstrated that transcription factor Sp1 (SP1) specifically interacted with the GC-box at -143 to -128 base pair on ELOVL7 promoter. Furthermore, the exogenous α- (ALA, 18: 3n-3), strengthened the binding of SP1 to the ELOVL7 proximal promoter, resulting in the accumulation of lipid droplets in bMECs. In conclusion, these data suggest that the transcription of bovine ELOVL7 is affected by the binding of SP1 and the treatment of ALA, moreover, enlightening us the profound role of SP1 in modulating lipid synthesis of the mammary gland in cattle.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28465089>Adipocyte lipid storage and adipokine production are modulated by lipoxygenase-derived oxylipins generated from 18-carbon fatty acids.</a></h1><p>Generation of oxylipins (oxygenated metabolites of fatty acids) by lipoxygenases may be responsible for the beneficial effects of 20- and 22-carbon n-3 fatty acids on adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity, but the potential actions of oxylipins derived from 18-carbon fatty acids, which are generally at higher levels in the diet, are unknown. We therefore compared the effects of select lipoxygenase-derived oxylipins produced from α- (ALA, C18:3 n-3), linoleic  (LA, C18:2 n-6), and arachidonic  (AA, C20:4 n-6) on key adipocyte functions that are altered in obesity. Individual oxylipins were added to the culture medium of differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes for 6days. Lipid accumulation was subsequently determined by Oil Red O staining, while Western blotting was used to measure levels of proteins associated with lipid metabolism and characteristics of adipocyte functionality. Addition of all oxylipins at 30nM was sufficient to significantly decrease triglyceride accumulation in lipid droplets, and higher levels completely blocked lipid production. Our results establish that lipoxygenase-derived oxylipins produced from 18-carbon PUFA differentially affect multiple adipocyte processes associated with lipid storage and adipokine production. However, these effects are not due to the oxylipins blocking adipocyte maturation and thus globally suppressing all adipocyte characteristics. Furthermore, these oxylipin species decrease the lipid content of adipocytes regardless from which precursor fatty  or lipoxygenase they were derived. Consequently, adipocyte characteristics can be altered through the ability of oxylipins to selectively modulate levels of proteins involved in both lipid metabolism and adipokine production.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Adipogenic differentiation of adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) plays an important role in the development of adipose tissue. In order to determine the effect of trans fatty acids on adipogenic differentiation in ADSCs, cells were treated with linoelaidic , as well as linoleic  and . We found that linoelaidic  significantly increased the lipid droplet formation and triglyceride content compared with linoleic  and . Linoelaidic  also down-regulated the levels of β-catenin in cells and inhibited the accumulation of β-catenin in cell nuclei. Lithium chloride, an activator of Wnt/β-catenin pathway, antagonized the enhancement of linoelaidic  on  and up-regulated the levels of β-catenin in ADSCs. These results indicated that linoelaidic  could enhance the adipogenic differentiation in ADSCs in vitro, which is partly due to the suppression of Wnt/β-catenin pathway.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of α-ESA on hepatic lipid metabolism. Using H4IIEC3 hepatoma cell line, we showed that α-ESA significantly lowered intracellular triglyceride accumulation compared to α- (LN), used as a fatty  control, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The effects of α-ESA on enzyme activities and mRNA profiles in H4IIEC3 cells suggested that enhanced fatty  oxidation and lowered  were involved in α-ESA-mediated triglyceride lowering effects. In addition, α-ESA triggered AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation without altering sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) protein levels. When cells were treated with vehicle control (VC), LN alone (LN; 100μmol/L) or in combination with α-ESA (LN+α-ESA; 75+25μmol/L) for 24h, acetylation of forkhead box protein O1 was decreased, while the NAD(+)/NADH ratio, mRNA levels of NAMPT and PTGR1 and enzyme activity of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase were increased by LN+α-ESA treatment compared to treatment with LN alone, suggesting that α-ESA activates SIRT1 by increasing NAD(+) synthesis and NAD(P)H consumption. The antisteatosis effect of α-ESA was confirmed in mice treated with a high-sucrose diet supplemented with 1% α-ESA for 5weeks. We conclude that α-ESA favorably affects hepatic lipid metabolism by increasing cellular NAD(+)/NADH ratio and activating PPARα, AMPK and SIRT1 signaling pathways.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, the adipogenic potential of fatty acids commonly found in fish oil (EPA and DHA) and vegetable oils (linoleic (LA) and  (ALA) acids), was evaluated in bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from gilthead sea bream. At a morphological level, cells adopted a round shape upon all treatments, losing their fibroblastic form and increasing lipid accumulation, especially in the presence of the n-6 PUFA, LA. The mRNA levels of the key transcription factor of osteogenesis, runx2 significantly diminished and those of relevant osteogenic genes remained stable after incubation with all fatty acids, suggesting that the osteogenic process might be compromised. On the other hand, transcript levels of the main -inducer factor, pparg increased in response to EPA. Nevertheless, the specific PPARγ antagonist T0070907 appeared to suppress the effects being caused by EPA over . Moreover, LA, ALA and their combinations, significantly up-regulated the fatty  transporter and binding protein, fatp1 and fabp11, supporting the elevated lipid content found in the cells treated with those fatty acids. Overall, this study has demonstrated that fatty acids favor lipid storage in gilthead sea bream bone-derived MSCs inducing their fate into the adipogenic versus the osteogenic lineage. This process seems to be promoted via different pathways depending on the fatty  source, being vegetable oils-derived fatty acids more prone to induce unhealthier metabolic phenotypes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29931237>Adipogenic/lipogenic gene expression and fatty  composition in chuck, loin, and round muscles in response to grain feeding of Yanbian Yellow cattle.</a></h1><p>We hypothesized that gene expression and fatty  composition would differ among different muscle depots and over time on a grain-based finishing diet. Additionally, we hypothesized that the concentration of SFA would decrease and the concentration of MUFA would increase proportionately with increases in percent intramuscular lipid (%IML). Ten Yanbian Yellow cattle steers (approximately 8 mo of age) were fed a corn-based diet in which the proportion of corn in the ration was increased at 4-mo intervals. Muscle samples were taken by biopsy from the chuck (trapezius), loin (longissimus dorsi), and round (biceps femoris) muscles at 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28 mo of age. The %IML increased from 12 to 28 mo of age, especially between 24 and 28 mo of age, with loin > round > chuck (age × muscle interaction P < 0.001). The percentage (g/100 g total fatty acids) of oleic  (18:1n-9), linoleic  (18:2n-6), and α- (18:3n-3), and the MUFA:SFA ratio increased with age, whereas palmitic (16:0) and stearic  (18:0) decreased with age in all muscles (age effect P < 0.001). The expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP1), adipose tissue fatty - binding protein (FABP4), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) increased, whereas the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and fatty  synthase (FASN) decreased with age. Expression of PPARγ, FABP4, SREBP1, SCD, FASN, ACC1, and LPL was greater in the loin than in the chuck or round (age × muscle interaction P < 0.001), although the MUFA:SFA ratio was greater in the chuck than in the loin or round (muscle effect P < 0.001). In conclusion, adipogenic gene expression was greater in the loin than in the chuck or round muscles, consistent with the greater %IML of the loin. However, the greater SCD gene expression in the loin did not result in a greater amount of MUFA in the loin, relative to the chuck and round.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26930155>Hypolipidemic Activity of Peony Seed Oil Rich in α-, is Mediated Through Inhibition of  and Upregulation of Fatty  β-Oxidation.</a></h1><p>Peony seed oil (PSO) is a new resource food rich in α-(ALA) (38.66%). The objective of this study was to assess the modulatory effect of PSO on lipid metabolism. Lard oil, safflower oil (SFO), and PSO were fed to wistar rats with 1% cholesterol in the diet for 60 d. Serum and liver lipids showed significant decrease in total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in PSO fed rats compared to lard oil and SFO fed rats. ALA, eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), contents were significantly increased, whereas linoleic  (LA), arachidonic  (AA) levels decreased in serum and liver of PSO fed rats. Feeding PSO increased ALA level and decreased n-6 to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) ratio. The hypolipidemic result of PSO indicated that PSO participated in the regulation of plasma lipid concentration and cholesterol metabolism in liver. The decreased expression of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins 1C (SREBP-1c), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and fatty  synthase (FAS)-reduced lipid synthesis; Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor (PPARα) accompanied by increase of uncoupling protein2 (UP2) and acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX) stimulated lipid metabolism and exerted an antiobesity effect via increasing energy expenditure for prevention of obesity.© 2016 Institute of Food Technologists®</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28727953>Fatty  Composition of Plasma Phosphatidylcholine Determines Body Fat Parameters in Subjects with Metabolic Syndrome-Related Traits.</a></h1><p>This study examines the associations of fatty acids (FAs) in plasma phosphatidylcholine (PC) with the anthropometrical and biochemical characteristic of patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS)-related traits.We analyzed the FA profiles of PC in 300 persons with MetS-related traits (152 M/148F, mean age 46.9 ± 9.0 years) and in 70 healthy controls of the same age using a balanced men/women ratio and gas-liquid chromatography. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to determine the coefficients of determination (R) using FA proportions of the mentioned proband characteristics.The FA composition of PC in patients with MetS traits was only associated with waist circumference (R = 0.27), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR; R = 0.41), body fat percentage (R = 0.62), and fat mass (R = 0.29). Positive associations were found for dihomo-γ- (DGLA), palmitic, stearic (SA), α- (ALA), and eicosapentaenoic acids, whereas negative associations were found for linoleic (LA), oleic, and docosapentaenoic acids. Palmitoleic  (POA) was positively associated with waist circumference but negatively with fat percentage. In controls, significant associations were found for waist circumference (R = 0.51), WHR (R = 0.53), body fat percentage (R = 0.60), and fat mass (R = 0.34). DGLA and saturated FA (SFA) were positively associated, whereas docosahexaenoic, adrenic, and cis-vaccenic acids were negatively associated. The study group differed from controls as follows: lower concentrations of LA and total n-6 FA, higher indices of delta-9-desaturase and delta-6 desaturase activity and higher proportions of POA, SA, ALA, DGLA, and SFA.We found significant associations (R >0.25) of FA in plasma PC with adiposity in middle-aged persons with MetS-related traits, but not with metabolic indices.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30207814>Perilla Oil Decreases Aortic and Hepatic Lipid Accumulation by Modulating  and Lipolysis in High-Fat Diet-Fed Mice.</a></h1><p>Perilla oil has been shown to be beneficial for ameliorating metabolic disorders, but its protective effect is still controversial. We investigated the effect of perilla oil on obesity-induced hepatic and vascular changes in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice and provided underlying mechanisms for potential therapeutic applications. Tomato and paprika extract was added to prevent the oxidation during storage of perilla oil. HFD-fed mice were orally administered palm or perilla oil for 90 days. Food intake, body and liver weight, and serum cholesterol levels were measured. Arterial and hepatic lipid accumulation was determined by histological staining. Hepatic triglyceride levels and the expression of proteins regulating lipid metabolism were analyzed. Food intake and body weight were not different between palm oil-treated and perilla oil-treated mice. Serum cholesterol level was significantly lower in perilla oil-treated mice compared with palm oil-treated mice. HFD-induced lipid accumulation was also lower in thoracic aorta and liver by perilla oil compared with palm oil. Perilla oil also decreased hepatic triglyceride level without changing the liver weight. Perilla oil treatment increased the AMP-activated protein kinase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation and the lipolytic protein levels, whereas it decreased the lipogenic protein levels in the liver. In conclusion, perilla oil reduced serum cholesterol and arterial and hepatic lipid accumulation in HFD-fed mice. The data suggest that perilla oil improves the balance of lipogenic and lipolytic protein expression, and ameliorates obesity-induced metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31010974>Transdifferentiation of bovine epithelial towards adipocytes in the presence of myoepithelium.</a></h1><p>Orchastric changes in the mammary glands are vital, especially during the lactaction. The secretary epithelial cells together with the supporting myoepithelial and stromal cells function cordially to secrete milk.Increase in the number of luminal epithelial cells and a decrease in adipocytes are visible during lactation, whereas the reverse happens in the involution. However, an early involution occurs if the epithelial transdifferente towards adipocytes in lactation period. We aimed to inhibit the adipocyte transdifferentiation of luminal cells by restraining the PPARγ pathway.  (LA) and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) induced  in mammary epithelial cells were conducted in monolayer, mixed culture as well as in transwell plate co-culture with mammary myoepithelial cells.Co-culture with myoepithelial cells showed higher adipogenic gene expression in epithelial cells under LA+TZDs treatment. Increase in the expressions of PPARγ, C/EBPα and vimentin in both mRNA as well as protein levels were observed.Whereas,BADGE treatment blocked LA+TZDs induced , as it could not show a significant rise in adipose related markers. Although comparative results were found in both mixed culture and monolayer conditions, co-culture technic found to work better than the others. In summary, antagonizing PPARγ pathway in the presence of myoepithelial cells can significantly reduce the adipogenisis in epithelial cells, suggestingtherapeutic inhibition of PPARγ can be considered to counter early involution or excessive  in mammary epithelium in animals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30159640>Insight into Arthrospira platensis Δ9 desaturase: a key enzyme in poly-unsaturated fatty  synthesis.</a></h1><p>Membrane-bound Δ9 desaturase perform oxygenated desaturation reactions to insert the first double bonds within fatty acyl chains between C9 and C10 positions of most saturated substrates.

In this paper, we report homology modeling and docking studies of a Δ9 desaturase from Arthrospira platensis strain. The protein model showed high topology resemblance compared to membrane-bound desaturases with a cytoplasmic core displaying the catalytic site and a transmembrane domain created by four α-helices. The cytoplasmic cap contained the three conserved-histidine boxes typical for all membrane bound desaturases. The protein model was used to perform protein-protein docking and the dimer structure was generated. The two monomers are tightly related with hydrophobic interactions between the transmembrane domain helices.

We therefore hypothesized that the combination of these dietary factors may ameliorate lipid metabolism more than the factors individually. Moreover, α-lipoic  exerts strong anti-oxidative activity. Hence, we also hypothesized that α-lipoic  may attenuate perilla oil-mediated oxidative stress. We therefore studied the combined effects of perilla oil and α-lipoic  on lipid metabolism and parameters of oxidative stress. Male rats were fed diets supplemented with 0 or 2.0 g/kg R-α-lipoic  and containing 120 g/kg of palm (saturated fat), corn (linoleic ), or perilla oil (α-) for 23 days. Perilla oil compared with other fats decreased serum lipid concentrations in rats fed α-lipoic -free diets; however, the combination of perilla oil with α-lipoic  was ineffective for observing more marked decreases in serum lipid levels. Alterations in hepatic fatty  synthesis and oxidation may account for the observed changes. Perilla oil, compared with palm and corn oils, strongly increased the malondialdehyde level in the serum and liver. α-Lipoic  counteracted the increases in these parameters even though the effects were attenuated in the liver. α-Lipoic  increased the parameters of the anti-oxidant system. The results suggested that α-lipoic  can ameliorate oxidative stress induced by perilla oil, but the combination of these dietary factors was ineffective for additionally reducing serum lipid levels.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The simple anthropometric measure of body mass index does not always reflect the biological effects of excessive body fat on health, thus additional molecular characterizations of obese phenotypes are needed to assess the risk of developing subsequent metabolic conditions at an individual level.To better understand the associations of free fatty acids (FFAs) with metabolic phenotypes of obesity, we applied a targeted metabolomics approach to measure 40 serum FFAs from 452 individuals who participated in four independent studies, using an ultra-performance liquid chromatograph coupled to a Xevo G2 quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometer.FFA levels were significantly elevated in overweight/obese subjects with diabetes compared to their healthy counterparts. We identified a group of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) that are closely correlated with metabolic status in two groups of obese individuals who underwent weight loss intervention and can predict the recurrence of diabetes at two years after metabolic surgery. Two UFAs, dihomo-gamma- and palmitoleic , were also able to predict the future development of metabolic syndrome (MS) in a group of obese subjects.These findings underscore the potential role of UFAs in the MS pathogenesis and also as important markers in predicting the risk of developing diabetes in obese individuals or diabetes remission after a metabolic surgery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28131819>Bovine lipid metabolism related gene GPAM: Molecular characterization, function identification, and association analysis with fat deposition traits.</a></h1><p>Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase mitochondrial (GPAM) is the enzyme that catalyzes the initial and committed step of glycerolipid synthesis in animal lipometabolism related pathway.

And then, 2 novel polymorphisms were identified within key functional domain of bovine GPAM gene by sequencing and the relationship between variants of GPAM gene with fat deposition traits of Chinese Simmental-cross steers was analyzed using statistical methods. The result showed that the knockdown of GPAM expression significantly reduced the synthesis of triglycerides and expression of lipid metabolism-related gene in BEF cells (p<0.05), and the over-expression of GPAM could significantly increased the levels of triglyceride and expression of lipid metabolism-related gene (p<0.05). The results of the correlation analysis also showed that cattle with TC genotype of GPAM E20-2823C>T was significantly associated with fatty  composition of intramuscular fat (had higher content of arachidic , eicosenoic , and arachidonic ), individuals with A-allele homozygotes and AG-allele heterozygotes of E20-3386G>A both had higher content of myristic , α-, and linoleic  in intramuscular fat than those with G-allele homozygotes (p<0.05).

Yet their composition at the individual droplet level and how it evolves over time in living cells is essentially unknown due to the lack of suitable quantitative nondestructive measurement techniques. In this work, we demonstrate the ability of label-free hyperspectral coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy, together with a quantitative image analysis algorithm developed by us, to quantify the lipid type and content in vol/vol concentration units of individual lipid droplets in living human adipose-derived stem cells during differentiation over 9 days in media supplemented with different fatty acids. Specifically, we investigated the addition of the polyunsaturated linoleic and  fatty acids into the normal differentiation medium (mostly containing monounsaturated fatty acids). We observe a heterogeneous uptake which is droplet-size dependent, time dependent, and lipid dependent. Cells grown in linoleic--supplemented medium show the largest distribution of lipid content across different droplets at all times during differentiation. When analyzing the average lipid content, we find that adding linoleic or  fatty acids at day 0 results in uptake of the new lipid components with an exponential time constant of 22 ± 2 h. Conversely, switching lipids at day 3 results in an exponential time constant of 60 ± 5 h. These are unprecedented findings, exemplifying that the quantitative imaging method demonstrated here could open a radically new way of studying and understanding cytosolic lipid droplets in living cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27028111>Plasma fatty  patterns reflect dietary habits and metabolic health: A cross-sectional study.</a></h1><p>Using pattern analysis, we investigated the relationship between plasma fatty  patterns, dietary intake, and biomarkers of metabolic health using data from the Irish National Adult Nutrition Survey.Plasma fatty  patterns were derived from 26 plasma fatty acids using k-means cluster analysis.

Conversely, supplemental linseed would upregulate expression of () and () in muscle of Yanbian Yellow steers. Thirty steers were assigned at random to 3 groups of 10 steers fed either the basal diet (corn grain and corn silage-based commercial concentrate [CON]), the CON diet plus 8% whole linseed (WLS; DM basis), or the CON diet plus 8% cracked linseed (CLS; DM basis) for 6 mo. The WLS and CLS supplements did not affect carcass weight, backfat thickness, or marbling scores ( > 0.10) but increased rib eye area and fat color (more yellow; < 0.05). The WLS and CLS diets decreased the proportions of 16:0 and 18:0 and increased the proportions of 18:1-9, 18:3-3, -9, -11 conjugated linoleic , total MUFA, and total PUFA in intramuscular, intermuscular, and subcutaneous adipose tissues. The WLS and CLS diets increased and gene expression whereas the supplements depressed , , , and gene expression in longissimus thoracis muscle, relative to CON muscle, consistent with our hypothesis. Because the WLS and CLS treatments did not affect any measure of carcass adiposity, these results indicated that linseed supplements promoted uptake of dietary lipids while concurrently depressing de novo fatty  biosynthesis in adipose tissue.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26189725>Hydroxytyrosol Inhibits Cannabinoid CB1 Receptor Gene Expression in 3T3-L1 Preadipocyte Cell Line.</a></h1><p>The 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line is a well characterized cell model for studying the adipocyte status and the molecular mechanisms involved in differentiation of these cells. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes have the ability to synthesize and degrade endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) and their differentiation into adipocytes increases the expression of cannabinoid (CB1) and PPAR-γ receptors. Clinically, the blocking stimulation of the endocannabinoid pathway has been one of the first approaches proposed to counteract the obesity and obesity-associated diseases (such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cancer). In this connection, here we studied in cultured 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes the effects of n-3-PUFA, α- (OM-3), n-6-PUFA, Linoleic  (OM-6), and hydroxytyrosol (HT) on the expression of CB1 receptor gene and the -related genes PPAR-γ, Fatty  Synthase (FAS) and Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL). HT was able to inhibit 3T3-L1 cell differentiation by down-regulating cell proliferation and CB1 receptor gene expression. HT exhibited anti-adipogenic effects, whereas OM-3 and OM-6 exerted an inhibitory action on cell proliferation associated with an induction of the preadipocytes differentiation and CB1 receptor gene expression. Moreover, the expression of FAS and LPL genes resulted increased after treatment with both HT and OM-3 and OM-6. The present study points out that the intake of molecules such as HT, contained in extra virgin olive oil, may be considered also in view of antiobesity and antineoplastic properties by acting directly on the adipose tissue and modulating CB1 receptor gene transcription.© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27592350>Trans10,cis15 18:2 Isolated from Beef Fat Does Not Have the Same Anti-Adipogenic Properties as Trans10,cis12-18:2 in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes.</a></h1><p>During ruminal biohydrogenation of α-, a non-conjugated non-methylene interrupted dienoic  is formed containing a t10 double bond, namely t10,c15-18:2. The present study was designed to examine whether t10,c15-18:2 would exert similar anti-adipogenic effects compared to t10,c12-18:2 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with 35 or 70 µM of LNA, t10,c12-18:2, t10,c15-18:2, or bovine serum albumin (BSA) vehicle control for 120 h. Cellular triacylglycerol and protein were quantified using commercial colorimetric kits. Cells were analyzed for fatty  composition and gene expression using gas chromatography and quantitative PCR, respectively. Trans10,cis12-18:2 decreased (P < 0.05) the adipocyte triacylglycerol (TAG) content, which was mainly related to a reduction in saturated fatty acids (SFA; e.g., 16:0 and 15:0) and cis monounsaturated fatty acids (c-MUFA; e.g., c9-16:1 and c9-18:1). Trans10,cis12 also decreased (P < 0.05) the expression of genes related to fatty  synthesis (ACACA, FASN), delta-9 desaturation (SCD1), fatty  elongation (ELOVL5), and fatty  uptake (LPL) and upregulated (P < 0.05) the expression of the rate-liming enzyme involved in fatty  β-oxidation (CPT1). In contrast, LNA and t10,c15-18:2 did not affect the gene expression and cellular content of the TAG, SFA, c-MUFA, or SCD1 indices in adipocytes. Our findings suggest that t10,c15-18:2, despite having structural similarity to t10,c12-18:2 (presence of a trans-10 double bond), does not exert anti-adipogenic effects in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25774202>AMP-activated protein kinase is required for the anti-adipogenic effects of .</a></h1><p>n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty  (n-3 LC PUFA) increases β-oxidation and limits lipid accumulation in adipocytes. The current study was conducted to determine whether their precursor  (ALA) could also exert the above effects and how AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was involved.AMPKα1(-/-), AMPKα2(-/-) mice and wild-type (WT) mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or HFD with ALA. Body weight was recorded weekly and serum was collected. Adipocytes size and expression of key players involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and lipid oxidation were also measured.Our results showed an elevated serum adiponectin level and a decreased leptin and insulin level in WT mice fed HFD with ALA when compared with WT mice fed HFD. In addition, dietary ALA decreased epididymal adiposity and adipocytes size in WT mice. At protein level, mitochondrial genes (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha [PGC1α] and nuclear respiratory factor-1 [nrf1]) and β-oxidation related genes (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A [CPT1a] and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha [PPARα]) were upregulated by dietary ALA in epididymal fat of WT mice. Consistently, dietary ALA also increased mitochondrial genomic DNA copy numbers. Moreover,  was repressed by dietary ALA, indicated by that expression of fatty  synthase (FAS), acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) were decreased. However, these aforementioned effects were abolished in the AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 knockout mice.Our results suggest that ALA could improve adipose tissue function and its anti-adipogenic effects are dependent on AMPK.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304472>Determination of Fat Accumulation Reduction by Edible Fatty Acids and Natural Waxes .</a></h1><p>Natural edible waxes mixed with plant oils, containing high levels of unsaturated fatty acids (FAs), are known as oleogels.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of FAs and natural waxes on the  in 3T3-L1 cells. The 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated and treated with FAs and waxes. These FAs [Palmitic  (PA), Stearic  (SA), Oleic  (OA), Linoleic  (LA), and  (ALA)] and waxes [beeswax (BW) and carnauba wax (CW)] were prepared at varying concentrations, and cell toxicity, triglyceride accumulation, lipid droplets size, and distribution inside of cells were determined. Adipogenic gene expression including , , , , and  was determined. Results showed that increasing the concentration of FAs and waxes led to a decrease in the adipocyte cells viability and metabolic performance. SA showed the highest level of triglyceride accumulation (p<0.05), whereas ALA showed the lowest (p<0.05). Both BW and CW at 3.0 ppm showed significantly higher lipid accumulation than in the control and other groups (p<0.05). ALA had significantly downregulated adipogenic gene expression levels, excluding those of , compared to the other treatment groups (p<0.05). Moreover, BW demonstrated similar adipogenic gene expression levels as ALA compared to CW.

Five-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fed diets consisting of 50% calories from lard, 5% from soybean, and 5% from corn oil (HFD), or 50% calories from lard and 10% from BRS oil (HFD + BRS oil diet) for 12 weeks. Six-week-old C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice were fed diets consisting of 16% calories from soybean oil (standard diet), 8% from soybean, and 8% from BRS oil, or 16% from BRS oil for 10 weeks. The BRS oil diets lowered the levels of triacylglycerol, nonesterified fatty acids, and total cholesterol in serum and liver of both of the obese and db/db mice as compared with the HFD and standard diet, respectively. mRNA levels of  markers including cluster of differentiation 36, fatty--binding protein 1, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c, fatty- synthase, and solute carrier family 25 member 1 in the liver of the BRS oil groups were lower than those in the liver of the HFD and standard groups in the obese and db/db mice, respectively. On the other hand, fatty- oxidation markers including carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, hydroxylacyl-CoA dehydrogenase α, and acyl-CoA oxidase in the liver of the BRS oil groups were higher than those in the liver of the HFD and standard groups in the obese and db/db mice, respectively. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α mRNA and protein levels increased in the liver and epididymal adipose tissue of the obese and db/db mice fed BRS oil compared with HFD and standard diet, respectively.

The aim of the present study was to find out whether α- (ALA) or DHA uptake can have an effect on activities and gene expressions of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism in the liver, subcutaneous adipose tissue and longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle of growing-finishing pigs. Six groups of ten pigs received one of six experimental diets supplemented with rapeseed oil in the control diet, extruded linseed, microalgae or a mixture of both to implement different levels of ALA and DHA with the same content in total n-3. Results were analysed for linear and quadratic effects of DHA intake. The results showed that activities of malic enzyme (ME) and fatty  synthase (FAS) decreased linearly in the liver with dietary DHA. Although the expression of the genes of these enzymes and their activities were poorly correlated, ME and FAS expressions also decreased linearly with DHA intake. The intake of DHA down-regulates the expressions of other genes involved in fatty  (FA) metabolism in some tissues of pigs, such as fatty  desaturase 2 and sterol-regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 in the liver and 2,4-dienoyl CoA reductase 2 in the LD muscle.

This study investigates the impact of substitution of linoleic  with α- (ALA) or long chain (LC) n-3 PUFA and hence decreasing n-6:n-3 fatty  ratio on high fat, high fructose (HFHF) diet induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups and fed control diet, HFHF diet (n-6:n-3 ratio of 200), HFHF diet with ALA (n-6:n-3 ratio of 2) or HFHF diet with LC n-3 PUFA (n-6:n-3 ratio of 5) for 24 weeks. Rats fed HFHF diet with n-6:n-3 ratio of 200 resulted in hepatic steatosis, induced glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and oxidative stress accompanied by increase in markers of inflammation, plasma lipids and aminotransferase levels. Histopathological examination of liver further confirmed the establishment of NASH. ALA and LC n-3 PUFA supplementation prevented hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia by inhibiting  and increasing insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, n-3 PUFA supplementation attenuated hepatic oxidative stress by restoring antioxidant status, decreased inflammation and preserved hepatic architecture. These finding suggest that decreasing n-6:n-3 ratio prevented HFHF induced NASH by attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28599651>Microtiter plate cultivation of oleaginous fungi and monitoring of lipogenesis by high-throughput FTIR spectroscopy.</a></h1><p>Oleaginous fungi can accumulate lipids by utilizing a wide range of waste substrates. They are an important source for the industrial production of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (gamma- and arachidonic ) and have been suggested as an alternative route for biodiesel production. Initial research steps for various applications include the screening of fungi in order to find efficient fungal producers with desired fatty  composition. Traditional cultivation methods (shake flask) and lipid analysis (extraction-gas chromatography) are not applicable for large-scale screening due to their low throughput and time-consuming analysis. Here we present a microcultivation system combined with high-throughput Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for efficient screening of oleaginous fungi.The microcultivation system enables highly reproducible fungal fermentations throughout 12 days of cultivation. Reproducibility was validated by FTIR and HPLC data. Analysis of FTIR spectral ester carbonyl peaks of fungal biomass offered a reliable high-throughput at-line method to monitor lipid accumulation. Partial least square regression between gas chromatography fatty  data and corresponding FTIR spectral data was used to set up calibration models for the prediction of saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, unsaturation index, total lipid content and main individual fatty acids. High coefficients of determination (R = 0.86-0.96) and satisfactory residual predictive deviation of cross-validation (RPD = 2.6-5.1) values demonstrated the goodness of these models.We have demonstrated in this study, that the presented microcultivation system combined with rapid, high-throughput FTIR spectroscopy is a suitable screening platform for oleaginous fungi. Sample preparation for FTIR measurements can be automated to further increase throughput of the system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29249532>Omega-3 PUFA modulate , ER stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction markers in NASH - Proteomic and lipidomic insight.</a></h1><p>Currently there is no FDA-approved therapy for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Increased n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ratio can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction that characterize NASH. Our recent study with n-3 PUFA showed improvement in individual histologic parameters like steatosis, ballooning and lobular inflammation. We hypothesized that n-3 PUFA therapy mediated improvement in histologic parameters is modulated by lipidomic and proteomic changes.We therefore evaluated hepatic proteomic and plasma lipidomic profiles before and after n-3 PUFA therapy in subjects with NASH. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, patients with NASH received 6-month treatment with n-3 PUFA (0.945 g/day [64%  (ALA), 21% eicosapentaenoic (EPA), and 16% docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids]). Paired liver biopsy and plasma collected before and after-n-3 PUFA therapy were assessed using mass spectrometry and gas chromatography for hepatic proteomics and plasma lipidomics. Data were matched to UniProt and LIPID MAPS database, respectively. Cytoscape software was used to analyze functional pathways. Twenty-seven NASH patients with paired liver histology and plasma before and after n-3 PUFA treatment were studied.Treatment with n-3 PUFA significantly increased ALA, EPA, and glycerophospholipids, and decreased arachidonic  (p < 0.05 for all). Further, proteomic markers of cell matrix, lipid metabolism, ER stress and cellular respiratory pathways were also modulated. Interestingly, these alterations reflected functional changes highly suggestive of decreased cellular lipotoxicity potential; reduced ER proteasome degradation of proteins and induction of chaperones; and a shift in cell energy homeostasis towards mitochondrial beta-oxidation.Six-month treatment with omega-3 PUFAs significantly improved hepatic proteomic and plasma lipidomic markers of , endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial functions in patients with NASH.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

However, some data suggest heterogeneity within the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) depot with potential metabolic differences between the superficial SAT (sSAT) and deep SAT (dSAT) compartments. We aimed to investigate the heterogeneity of these three depots with regard to fatty  (FA) composition and gene expression. Adipose tissue biopsies were collected from 75 obese women undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery. FA composition and gene expression were determined with gas chromatography and quantitative real-time-PCR, respectively. Stearoyl CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) activity was estimated by product-to-precursor FA ratios. All polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) with 20 carbons were consistently lower in VAT than either SAT depots, whereas essential PUFA (linoleic , 18:2n-6 and α-, 18:3n-3) were similar between all three depots. Lauric and palmitic  were higher and lower in VAT, respectively. The SCD-1 product palmitoleic  as well as estimated SCD-1 activity was higher in VAT than SAT. Overall, there was a distinct association pattern between lipid metabolizing genes and individual FAs in VAT. In conclusion, SAT and VAT are two distinct depots with regard to FA composition and expression of key lipogenic genes. However, the small differences between sSAT and dSAT suggest that FA metabolism of SAT is rather homogenous.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580553>n-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids for the management of alcoholic liver disease: A critical review.</a></h1><p>Excess alcohol exposure leads to alcoholic liver disease (ALD), a predominant cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the past decade, increasing attention has been paid to understand the association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and ALD. In this review, we summarize the metabolism of n-3 PUFAs, animal model of ALD, and the findings from recent studies determining the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD as a possible treatment. The animal models of acute ethanol exposure, chronic ethanol exposure and chronic-plus-single binge ethanol feeding have been widely used to explore the impact of n-3 PUFAs. Although the results of studies regarding the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD have been inconsistent or controversial, increasing evidence has demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs may be useful in alleviating alcoholic steatosis and alcohol-induced liver injury through multiple mechanisms, including decreased   and lipid mobilization from adipose tissue, enhanced mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation, reduced hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, and promoted intestinal homeostasis, positively suggesting that n-3 PUFAs might be promising for the management of ALD. The oxidation of n-3 PUFAs  in an experimental diet was rarely considered in most n-3 PUFA-related studies, likely contributing to the inconsistent results. Thus, the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD deserves greater research efforts and remains to be evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled clinic trial.

Anthropometric evaluation, liver ultrasound examination and scoring for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD score = 0-6), and biochemical and plasma fatty acids analysis were performed. We compared the composition ratio of fatty acids between children with high-grade liver steatosis (NAFLD score = 4-6), low-grade liver steatosis (NAFLD score = 1-3), and healthy controls (NAFLD score = 0). In addition, correlation coefficients (r) between NAFLD score, metabolic variables, and estimated activity of desaturase indices (stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase-1 (SCD1), delta-5 and delta-6 desaturase) were calculated.Compared with healthy controls, children with liver steatosis showed a higher proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids (21.16 ± 2.81% vs. 19.68 ± 2.71%, p = 0.024). In addition, children with high- grade liver steatosis exhibited higher proportions of palmitic  (C16:0), palmitoleic  (C16:1n-7), dihomo-γ- (C20:3n-6), adrenic  (C22:4n-6), and docosapentaenoic  (C22:5n-6); and lower proportions of eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5n-3) (P< 0.05).

Primary cells were isolated from the mammary glands of Holstein dairy cows and were passaged twice. Afterward, the cells were randomly allocated to six treatments, five UFA-treated groups, and one control group. For all of the treatments, the the fetal bovine serum in the culture solution was replaced with fatty -free BSA (1 g/L), and the cells were treated with different ratios of oleic, linoleic, and  acids (0.75:4:1, 1.5:10:1, 2:13.3:1, 3:20:1, and 4:26.7:1) for 48 h, which were group 1 to group 5. The control culture solution contained only fatty -free BSA without UFAs (0 μM). The results indicated that the cell viability was not affected by adding different ratios of UFAs, but the accumulation of TAG was significantly influenced by supplementing with different ratios of UFAs. Adding different ratios of UFAs suppressed the expression of ACACA and FASN but had the opposite effect on the abundances of FABP3 and CD36 mRNA. The expression levels of PPARG, SPEBF1, CSN1S1, and CSN3 mRNA in the BMECs were affected significantly after adding different ratios of UFAs. Our results suggested that groups 1, 2, and 3 (0.75:4:1, 1.5:10:1, and 2:13.3:1) had stronger auxo-action on fat synthesis in the BMECs, where group 3 (2:13.3:1) was the best, followed by group 4 (3:20:1). However, group 5 (4:26.7:1) was the worst. Genes related to protein synthesis in the BMECs were better promoted in groups 2 and 3, and group 3 had the strongest auxo-action, whereas the present study only partly examined the regulation of protein synthesis at the transcriptional level; more studies on translation level are needed in the future. Therefore, when combining fat and protein synthesis, group 3 could be obviously fat and protein synthesis in the BMECs concurrently. However, further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanism for regulating fat and protein synthesis in the BMECs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28920418>Differential characterization of myogenic satellite cells with  and retinoic  in the presence of thiazolidinediones from prepubertal Korean black goats.</a></h1><p>Myogenic satellite cells were isolated from semitendinosus muscle of prepubertal Korean black goat to observe the differential effect of  and retinoic  in thepresence of thiazolidinediones (TZD) and also to observe the production insulin sensitive preadipocyte.Cells were characterized for their stemness with cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34), CD13, CD106, CD44, Vimentin surface markers using flow cytometry. Cells characterized themselves as possessing significant (p<0.05) levels of CD13, CD34, CD106, Vimentin revealing their stemness potential. Goat myogenic satellite cells also exhibited CD44, indicating that they possessed a % of stemness factors of adipose lineage apart from their inherent stemness of paxillin factors 3/7.Cells during proliferation stayed absolutely and firmly within the myogenic fate without any external cues and continued to show a significant (p<0.05) fusion index % to express myogenic differentiation, myosin heavy chain, and smooth muscle actin in 2% horse serum. However, confluent myogenic satellite cells were the ones easily turning into adipogenic lineage. Intriguingly, upregulation in adipose specific genetic markers such as peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor γ, adiponectin, lipoprotein lipase, and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α were observed and confirmed in all given treatments. However, the amount of  was found to be statistically significant (p<0.01) with  as compared to retinoic  in combination with TZD's.Retinoic  was found to produce smaller preadipocytes which have been assumed to have insulin sensitization and hence retinoic  could be used as a potential agent to sensitize tissues to insulin in combination with TZD's to treat diabetic conditions in humans and animals in future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28727036>Supplementation of glycerol or fructose via drinking water to grazing lambs on tissue glycogen level and lipogenesis.</a></h1><p>Lambs ( = 18; 40.1 ± 7.4 kg BW) were used to assess supplementation of glycerol or fructose via drinking water on growth, tissue glycogen levels, postmortem , and lipogenesis. Lambs were blocked by BW and allocated to alfalfa paddocks (2 lambs/paddock and 3 paddocks/treatment). Each paddock within a block was assigned randomly to drinking water treatments for 30 d: 1) control (CON), 2) 120 g fructose/L of drinking water (FRU), or 3) 120 g glycerol/L of drinking water (GLY). Lambs grazed alfalfa with free access to water treatments for 28 d and then were fasted in indoor pens for a final 2 d with access to only water treatments. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS with water treatment and time (when appropriate) in the model. During the 28-d grazing period, ADG was greater ( < 0.05) for GLY than for CON or FRU. During the 2-d fasting period, BW shrink was lower ( < 0.05) for GLY compared with CON or FRU. Hot carcass weight was greater ( < 0.05) for GLY than for FRU. The interaction for glycogen content × postmortem time was significant ( = 0.003) in LM and semitendinosus (ST) muscles. Glycogen content in the LM was greater ( < 0.05) for GLY at 2 and 3 h and for FRU at 1 h postmortem compared with CON. Glycogen content in ST did not differ between treatments ( > 0.05). Liver glycogen content was over 14-fold greater ( < 0.05) for GLY compared with FRU or CON. Liver free glucose was greater ( < 0.05) for GLY than for CON, whereas liver lipid content was higher ( < 0.05) for CON than for GLY. Supplementation with GLY increased ( < 0.05) odd-chain fatty acids in LM, subcutaneous fat (SQ), and the liver. Stearic  (C18:0) concentrations were reduced in LM ( = 0.064) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SQ; = 0.018), whereas oleic  (C18:1 -9) concentration tended to be increased ( = 0.066) in SQ with FRU and GLY.  (C18:3 -3) was reduced ( = 0.031) and all long-chain -3 fatty  (eicosapentaenoic , docosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic ) concentrations were increased ( < 0.05) with FRU and GLY compared with CON. Glycerol supplementation upregulated ( < 0.05) stearoyl-CoA desaturate () and fatty  synthase () mRNA by over 40-fold in the SQ and 5-fold in the liver. Glycerol supplementation also upregulated ( < 0.05) glucose transporters and glycogen branching enzyme in the liver. Overall, glycerol supplementation improved growth, reduced BW shrink during fasting, increased glycogen content in muscle and the liver, and stimulated de novo lipogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26597785>Palmitic  (16:0) competes with omega-6 linoleic and omega-3 ɑ- acids for FADS2 mediated Δ6-desaturation.</a></h1><p>Sapienic , 16:1n-10 is the most abundant unsaturated fatty  on human skin where its synthesis is mediated by FADS2 in the sebaceous glands. The FADS2 product introduces a double bond at the Δ6, Δ4 and Δ8 positions by acting on at least ten substrates, including 16:0, 18:2n-6, and 18:3n-3. Our aim was to characterize the competition for accessing FADS2 mediated Δ6 desaturation between 16:0 and the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the human diet, 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3, to evaluate whether competition may be relevant in other tissues and thus linked to metabolic abnormalities associated with FADS2 or fatty  levels. MCF7 cells stably transformed with FADS2 biosynthesize 16:1n-10 from exogenous 16:0 in preference to 16:1n-7, the immediate product of SCD highly expressed in cancer cell lines, and 16:1n-9 via partial β-oxidation of 18:1n-9. Increasing availability of 18:2n-6 or 18:3n-3 resulted in decreased bioconversion of 16:0 to 16:1n-10, simultaneously increasing the levels of highly unsaturated products. FADS2 cells accumulate the desaturation-elongation products 20:3n-6 and 20:4n-3 in preference to the immediate desaturation products 18:3n-6 and 18:4n-3 implying prompt/coupled elongation of the nascent desaturation products. MCF7 cells incorporate newly synthesized 16:1n-10 into phospholipids. These data suggest that excess 16:0 due to, for instance, de novo  from high carbohydrate or alcohol consumption, inhibits synthesis of highly unsaturated fatty acids, and may in part explain why supplemental preformed EPA and DHA in some studies improves insulin resistance and other factors related to diabetes and metabolic syndrome aggravated by excess calorie consumption.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Male apolipoprotein E-deficient mice (BALB/c.KOR/StmSlc-  ) were fed experimental diets containing 100 g/kg of palm oil (saturated fat), safflower oil (rich in linoleic ), γ- oil (rich in γ-), or fat mixtures composed of safflower and γ- oils (65:35 and 30:70, w/w) for 20 days. γ- oil, compared with palm and safflower oils, strongly and dose-dependently increased the activity and mRNA levels of hepatic fatty  oxidation enzymes. In general, safflower and γ- oils, compared with palm oil, reduced the activity and mRNA levels of lipogenic enzymes. However, these oils were equivalent in reducing the parameters of , excluding malic enzyme and pyruvate kinase. The diets containing safflower and γ- oils, compared with the palm oil diet, significantly decreased serum triacylglycerol and cholesterol levels. The decreases were greater with γ- oil than with safflower oil. γ- oil exerted strong serum lipid-lowering effects in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice apparently through the changes in hepatic fatty  metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30043014>Borago officinalis seed oil (BSO), a natural source of omega-6 fatty acids, attenuates fat accumulation by activating peroxisomal beta-oxidation both in C. elegans and in diet-induced obese rats.</a></h1><p>Obesity is a medical condition with increasing prevalence, characterized by an accumulation of excess fat that could be improved using some bioactive compounds. However, many of these compounds with in vitro activity fail to respond in vivo, probably due to the sophistication of the physiological energy regulatory networks. In this context, C. elegans has emerged as a plausible model for the identification and characterization of the effect of such compounds on fat storage in a complete organism. However, the results obtained in such a simple model are not easily extrapolated to more complex organisms such as mammals, which hinders its application in the short term. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain new experimental data about the evolutionary conservation of the mechanisms of fat loss between worms and mammals. Previously, we found that some omega-6 fatty acids promote fat loss in C. elegans by up-regulation of peroxisomal fatty  β-oxidation in an omega-3 independent manner. In this work, we prove that the omega-6 fatty acids' effects on worms are also seen when they are supplemented with a natural omega-6 source (borage seed oil, BSO). Additionally, we explore the anti-obesity effects of two doses of BSO in a diet-induced obesity rat model, validating the up-regulation of peroxisomal fatty  β-oxidation. The supplementation with BSO significantly reduces body weight gain and energy efficiency and prevents white adipose tissue accumulation without affecting food intake. Moreover, BSO also increases serum HDL-cholesterol levels, improves insulin resistance and promotes the down-regulation of Cebpa, an -related gene. Therefore, we conclude that the effects of omega-6 fatty acids are highly conserved between worms and obesity-induced mammals, so these compounds could be considered to treat or prevent obesity-related disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968772>Targeting n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by abnormal hepatic accumulation of triacylglycerides in the absence of alcohol consumption, in association with oxidative stress (OS), a pro-inflammatory state and insulin resistance (IR), which are attenuated by n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) C20-C22 (LCPUFAs) supplementation. Main causes of NAFLD comprise high caloric intake and a sedentary lifestyle, with high intakes of saturated FAs.The review includes several searches considering the effects of n-3 LCPUFAs in NAFLD in vivo and in vitro models, using the PubMed database from the National Library of Medicine-National Institutes of Health.The LCPUFAs eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5 n-3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (C22:6 n-3, DHA) have a positive effect in diminishing liver steatosis, OS, and the levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and pro-inflammatory cytokines, with improvement of insulin sensitivity and adiponectin levels. The molecular pathways described for n-3 LCPUFAs in cellular and animal models and humans include peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α activation favouring FA oxidation, diminution of  due to sterol responsive element binding protein-1c downregulation and inflammation resolution. Besides, nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 activation is elicited by n-3 LCPUFA-derived oxidation products producing direct and indirect antioxidant responses, with concomitant anti-fibrogenic action.The discussed effects of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation support its use in NAFLD, although having a limited value in NASH, a contention that may involve n-3 LCPUFA oxygenated derivatives. Clinical trials establishing optimal dosages, intervention times, type of patients and possible synergies with other natural products are needed in future studies.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p></html>
