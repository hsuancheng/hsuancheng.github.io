<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30230150>Simple Alkaline-Earth Metal Catalysts for Effective Alkene Hydrogenation.</a></h2><p>Alkaline earth metal amides (AeN'' : Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba, N''=N(SiMe ) ) catalyze alkene hydrogenation (80-120 °C, 1-6 bar H , 1-10 mol % cat.), with the activity increasing with metal size. Various activated C=C bonds (styrene, p-MeO-styrene, α-Me-styrene, Ph C=CH , trans-stilbene, cyclohexadiene, 1-Ph-cyclohexene), semi-activated C=C bonds (Me SiCH=CH , norbornadiene), or non-activated (isolated) C=C bonds (norbornene, , 1-hexene) could be reduced. The results show that neutral Ca or Ba catalysts are active in the challenging hydrogenation of isolated double bonds. For activated alkenes (e.g. styrene), polymerization is fully suppressed due to fast protonation of the highly reactive benzyl intermediate by N''H (formed in the catalyst initiation). Using cyclohexadiene as the H source, the first Ae metal catalyzed H-transfer hydrogenation is reported. DFT calculations on styrene hydrogenation using CaN'' show that styrene oligomerization competes with styrene hydrogenation. Calculations also show that protonation of the benzylcalcium intermediate with N''H is a low- escape route, thus avoiding oligomerization.© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The optimized molecular geometry and vibrational frequencies of the fundamental modes of 4-VCH have been precisely assigned and analyzed with the aid of structure optimizations and normal coordinate force field calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) method at 6-311++G(d,p) level basis set. The theoretical frequencies were properly scaled and compared with experimentally obtained FT-IR and FT-Raman spectra. Also, the effect due the substitution of vinyl group on the ring vibrational frequencies was analyzed and a detailed interpretation of the vibrational spectra of this compound has been made on the basis of the calculated total  distribution (TED). The time dependent DFT (TD-DFT) method was employed to predict its electronic properties, such as electronic transitions by UV-Visible analysis, HOMO and LUMO energies, molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) and various global reactivity and selectivity descriptors (chemical hardness, chemical potential, softness, electrophilicity index). Stability of the molecule arising from hyper conjugative interaction, charge delocalization has been analyzed using natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis. Atomic charges obtained by Mulliken population analysis and NBO analysis are compared. Thermodynamic properties (heat capacity, entropy and enthalpy) of the title compound at different temperatures are also calculated.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p></html>
