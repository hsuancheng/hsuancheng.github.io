Here, using RNA-Seq analysis, we report that genes involved in cell wall metabolism are differentially regulated in the Δ mutant. Consistently, the mutant contained lower β-glucan and mannan levels and exhibited increased chitin content in the cell wall. As cell wall components are known to regulate the innate immune response, we next determined the macrophage transcriptional response to  infection and observed differential expression of genes implicated in inflammation, chemotaxis, ion transport, and the tumor necrosis factor signaling cascade. Importantly, the Δ mutant evoked a different immune response, resulting in an enhanced release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in THP-1 macrophages. Further, Δ-induced IL-1β production adversely affected intracellular proliferation of co-infected WT cells and depended on activation of spleen  kinase (Syk) signaling in the host cells. Accordingly, the Syk inhibitor R406 augmented intracellular survival of the Δ mutant. Finally, we demonstrate that  infection triggers elevated IL-1β production in mouse organs and that the  genes are required for organ  and dissemination in the murine model of systemic infection. Altogether, our results uncover the basis for macrophage-mediated killing of Δ cells and provide the first evidence that aspartyl proteases in  are required for suppression of IL-1β production in macrophages.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30372491>Alteration of Flt3-Ligand-dependent de novo generation of conventional dendritic cells during influenza infection contributes to respiratory bacterial superinfection.</a></h2><p>Secondary bacterial infections contribute to the excess morbidity and mortality of influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Disruption of lung integrity and impaired antibacterial immunity during IAV infection participate in  and dissemination of the bacteria out of the lungs. One key feature of IAV infection is the profound alteration of lung myeloid cells, characterized by the recruitment of deleterious inflammatory monocytes. We herein report that IAV infection causes a transient decrease of lung conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) (both cDC1 and cDC2) peaking at day 7 post-infection. While triggering emergency monopoiesis, IAV transiently altered the differentiation of cDCs in the bone marrow, the cDC1-biaised pre-DCs being particularly affected. The impaired cDC differentiation during IAV infection was independent of type I interferons (IFNs), IFN-γ, TNFα and IL-6 and was not due to an intrinsic dysfunction of cDC precursors. The alteration of cDC differentiation was associated with a drop of local and systemic production of Fms-like  kinase 3 ligand (Flt3-L), a critical cDC differentiation factor. Overexpression of Flt3-L during IAV infection boosted the cDC progenitors' production in the BM, replenished cDCs in the lungs, decreased inflammatory monocytes' infiltration and lowered lung damages. This was associated with partial protection against secondary pneumococcal infection, as reflected by reduced bacterial dissemination and prolonged survival. These findings highlight the impact of distal viral infection on cDC genesis in the BM and suggest that Flt3-L may have potential applications in the control of secondary infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30631039>CD44v6 engages in colorectal cancer progression.</a></h2><p>CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein. When the CD44 gene is expressed, its pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) can be alternatively spliced into mature mRNAs that encode several CD44 isoforms. The mRNA assembles with ten standard exons, and the sixth variant exon encodes CD44v6, which engages in a variety of biological processes, including cell growth, apoptosis, migration, and angiogenesis. Mechanistically, CD44v6 interacts with hyaluronic acid (HA) or osteopontin, or it acts as a coreceptor for various cytokines, such as epidermal growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and C-X-C motif chemokine 12. In this context, the receptor  kinase or G protein-coupled receptor-associated signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase and phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt, are activated. Using these actions, homeostasis or regeneration can be facilitated among normal tissues. However, overexpression of the mature mRNA encoding CD44v6 can induce cancer progression. For example, CD44v6 assists colorectal cancer stem cells in , invasion, and metastasis. Overexpression of CD44v6 predicts poor prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer, as patients with a large number of CD44v6-positive cells in their tumors are generally diagnosed at late stages. Thus, the clinical significance of CD44v6 in colorectal cancer deserves consideration. Preclinical results have indicated satisfactory efficacies of anti-CD44 therapy among several cancers, including prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and gastric cancer. Moreover, clinical trials aiming to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and toxicity of a commercialized anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody developed by Roche (RO5429083) have been conducted among patients with CD44-expressing malignant tumors, and a clinical trial focusing on the dose escalation of this antibody is ongoing. Thus, we are hopeful that anti-CD44 therapy will be applied in the treatment of colorectal cancer in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30477188>Genomic Islands Confer Heavy Metal Resistance in  and  Isolated from a Gold/Copper Mine.</a></h2><p>Heavy metals (HMs) are compounds that can be hazardous and impair growth of living organisms. Bacteria have evolved the capability not only to cope with heavy metals but also to detoxify polluted environments. Three heavy metal-resistant strains of  and one of  were isolated from the gold/copper Zijin mining site, Longyan, Fujian, China. These strains were shown to exhibit high resistance to heavy metals with minimal inhibitory concentration reaching up to 3.5 mM Cu, 21 mM Zn, 1.2 mM Cd, and 10.0 mM As. Genomes of the four strains were sequenced by Illumina. Sequence analyses revealed the presence of a high abundance of heavy metal resistance (HMR) determinants. One of the strain,  P2, carried genes encoding 6 putative P-ATPase, 5 putative P-ATPase, 4 putative Zn/Cd P type ATPase, and 16 putative resistance-nodulation-division (RND)-type metal transporter systems. Moreover, the four genomes contained a high abundance of genes coding for putative metal binding chaperones. Analysis of the close vicinity of these HMR determinants uncovered the presence of clusters of genes potentially associated with mobile genetic elements. These loci included genes coding for  recombinases (integrases) and subunits of mating pore (type 4 secretion system), respectively allowing integration/excision and conjugative transfer of numerous genomic islands. Further in silico analyses revealed that their genetic organization and gene products resemble the  integrative and conjugative element CTnDOT. These results highlight the pivotal role of genomic islands in the acquisition and dissemination of adaptive traits, allowing for rapid adaption of bacteria and  of hostile environments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31420448>Molecular features of lipoprotein CD0873: A potential vaccine against the human pathogen .</a></h2><p> is the primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis, a healthcare-associated intestinal disease resulting in a significant fatality rate.  of the gut is critical for  pathogenesis.

In this report, we show that signal transducing adaptor protein 2 (STAP-2) is involved in cell migration, proliferation, and melanogenesis as well as chemokine receptor expression and tumorigenesis in B16F10 melanoma cells. This was evident in mice injected with STAP-2 shRNA (shSTAP-2)-expressing B16F10 cells, which infiltrated organs in a completely different pattern from the original cells, showing massive  in the liver, kidney, and neck but not in the lung. The most important finding was that STAP-2 expression determined tyrosinase protein content. STAP-2 colocalized with tyrosinase in lysosomes and protected tyrosinase from protein degradation. It is noteworthy that B16F10 cells with knocked down tyrosinase showed similar cell characteristics as shSTAP-2 cells. These results indicated that tyrosinase contributed to some cellular events beyond melanogenesis. Taken together, one possibility is that STAP-2 positively regulates the protein levels of tyrosinase, which determines tumor invasion via controlling chemokine receptor expression.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30197088>The Genetic Basis of Adaptation following Plastic Changes in Coloration in a Novel Environment.</a></h2><p>Phenotypic plasticity has been hypothesized to precede and facilitate adaptation to novel environments [1-8], but examples of plasticity preceding adaptation in wild populations are rare (but see [9, 10]). We studied a population of side-blotched lizards, Uta stansburiana, living on a lava flow that formed 22,500 years ago [11] to understand the origin of their novel melanic phenotype that makes them cryptic on the black lava. We found that lizards living on and off of the lava flow exhibited phenotypic plasticity in coloration but also appeared to have heritable differences in pigmentation. We sequenced the exomes of 104 individuals and identified two known regulators of melanin production, PREP and PRKAR1A, which had markedly increased levels of divergence between lizards living on and off the lava flow. The derived variants in PREP and PRKAR1A were only found in the lava population and were associated with increased pigmentation levels in an experimental cohort of hatchling lizards. Simulations suggest that the derived variants in the PREP and PRKAR1A genes arose recently and were under strong positive selection in the lava population. Overall, our results suggest that ancestral plasticity for coloration facilitated initial survival in the lava environment and was followed by genetic changes that modified the phenotype in the direction of the induced plastic response, possibly through de novo mutations. These observations provide a detailed example supporting the hypothesis that plasticity aids in the initial  of a novel habitat, with natural selection subsequently refining the phenotype with genetic adaptations to the new environment.

To elucidate signals controlling tumor cell adhesion to the endothelium and subsequent transendothelial migration, we performed phosphoproteomic analysis to map cell-specific changes in protein phosphorylation that were triggered by contact between metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and endothelial cells. From the 2669 unique phosphorylation sites identified, 77 and 43 were differentially phosphorylated in the tumor cells and endothelial cells, respectively. The receptor  kinase ephrin type A receptor 2 (EPHA2) exhibited decreased Tyr(772) phosphorylation in the cancer cells upon endothelial contact. Knockdown of EPHA2 increased adhesion of the breast cancer cells to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and their transendothelial migration in coculture cell assays, as well as early-stage lung  in vivo. EPHA2-mediated inhibition of transendothelial migration of breast cancer cells depended on interaction with the ligand ephrinA1 on HUVECs and phosphorylation of EPHA2-Tyr(772). When EPHA2 phosphorylation dynamics were compared between cell lines of different metastatic ability, EPHA2-Tyr(772) was rapidly dephosphorylated after ephrinA1 stimulation specifically in cells targeting the lung. Knockdown of the phosphatase LMW-PTP reduced adhesion and transendothelial migration of the breast cancer cells. Overall, cell-specific phosphoproteomic analysis provides a bidirectional map of contact-initiated signaling between tumor and endothelial cells that can be further investigated to identify mechanisms controlling the transendothelial cell migration of cancer cells.Copyright © 2016, American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25251599>Axl activates autocrine transforming growth factor-β signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), intrahepatic metastasis frequently correlates with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of malignant hepatocytes. Several mechanisms have been identified to be essentially involved in hepatocellular EMT, among them transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling. Here we show the up-regulation and activation of the receptor  kinase Axl in EMT-transformed hepatoma cells. Knockdown of Axl expression resulted in abrogation of invasive and transendothelial migratory abilities of mesenchymal HCC cells in vitro and Axl overexpression-induced metastatic  of epithelial hepatoma cells in vivo. Importantly, Axl knockdown severely impaired resistance to TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition. Analysis of the Axl interactome revealed binding of Axl to 14-3-3ζ, which is essentially required for Axl-mediated cell invasion, transendothelial migration, and resistance against TGF-β. Axl/14-3-3ζ signaling caused phosphorylation of Smad3 linker region (Smad3L) at Ser213, resulting in the up-regulation of tumor-progressive TGF-β target genes such as PAI1, MMP9, and Snail as well as augmented TGF-β1 secretion in mesenchymal HCC cells. Accordingly, high Axl expression in HCC patient samples correlated with elevated vessel invasion of HCC cells, higher risk of tumor recurrence after liver transplantation, strong phosphorylation of Smad3L, and lower survival. In addition, elevated expression of both Axl and 14-3-3ζ showed strongly reduced survival of HCC patients.Our data suggest that Axl/14-3-3ζ signaling is central for TGF-β-mediated HCC progression and a promising target for HCC therapy.© 2014 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28783171>The PDGFRα-laminin B1-keratin 19 cascade drives tumor progression at the invasive front of human hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) expressing the biliary/hepatic progenitor cell marker keratin 19 (K19) have been linked with a poor prognosis and exhibit an increase in platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) and laminin beta 1 (LAMB1) expression. PDGFRα has been reported to induce de novo synthesis of LAMB1 protein in a Sjogren syndrome antigen B (La/SSB)-dependent manner in a murine metastasis model. However, the role of this cascade in human HCC remains unclear. This study focused on the functional role of the PDGFRα-La/SSB-LAMB1 pathway and its molecular link to K19 expression in human HCC. In surgical HCC specimens from a cohort of 136 patients, PDGFRα expression correlated with K19 expression, microvascular invasion and metastatic spread. In addition, PDGFRα expression in pre-operative needle biopsy specimens predicted poor overall survival during a 5-year follow-up period. Consecutive histological staining demonstrated that the signaling components of the PDGFRα-La/SSB-LAMB1 pathway were strongly expressed at the invasive front. K19-positive HCC cells displayed high levels of α2β1 integrin (ITG) receptor, both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro activation of PDGFRα signaling triggered the translocation of nuclear La/SSB into the cytoplasm, enhanced the protein synthesis of LAMB1 by activating its internal ribosome entry site, which in turn led to increased secretion of laminin-111. This effect was abrogated by the PDGFRα-specific inhibitor crenolanib. Importantly LAMB1 stimulated ITG-dependent focal adhesion kinase/Src proto-oncogene non-receptor  kinase signaling. It also promoted the ITG-specific downstream target Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2, induced K19 expression in an autocrine manner, invadopodia formation and cell invasion. Finally, we showed that the knockdown of LAMB1 or K19 in subcutaneous xenograft mouse models resulted in significant loss of cells invading the surrounding stromal tissue and reduced HepG2  into lung and liver after tail vein injection. The PDGFRα-LAMB1 pathway supports tumor progression at the invasive front of human HCC through K19 expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26246600>Ezrin regulates focal adhesion and invadopodia dynamics by altering calpain activity to promote breast cancer cell invasion.</a></h2><p>Up-regulation of the cytoskeleton linker protein ezrin frequently occurs in aggressive cancer types and is closely linked with metastatic progression. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms detailing how ezrin is involved in the invasive and metastatic phenotype remain unclear. Here we report a novel function of ezrin in regulating focal adhesion (FA) and invadopodia dynamics, two key processes required for efficient invasion to occur. We show that depletion of ezrin expression in invasive breast cancer cells impairs both FA and invadopodia turnover. We also demonstrate that ezrin-depleted cells display reduced calpain-mediated cleavage of the FA and invadopodia-associated proteins talin, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and cortactin and reduced calpain-1-specific membrane localization, suggesting a requirement for ezrin in maintaining proper localization and activity of calpain-1. Furthermore, we show that ezrin is required for cell directionality, early lung seeding, and distant organ  but not primary tumor growth. Collectively our results unveil a novel mechanism by which ezrin regulates breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis.© 2015 Hoskin et al.

The multiplicity of infection in the low- and high-concentration groups was 10:1 and 100:1, respectively.

Flow cytometry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and western blots were used to detect cell cycle progression. In the high-concentration group, the invasion of  was observed by transmission electron microscopy.It was found that  invaded the fibroblasts, with cytoplasmic localization. Analyses of cell proliferation and flow cytometry showed that  inhibited the proliferation of periodontal fibroblasts by causing G2 phase arrest. The inhibition of proliferation and G2 phase arrest were more obvious in the high-concentration group. In the low-concentration group, the G2 phase regulatory factors cyclin dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and cell division cycle 25C (Cdc25C) were upregulated, while cyclin B1 was inhibited. However, in the high-concentration group, cyclin B1 was upregulated and CDK1 was inhibited. Furthermore, the deactivated states of  phosphorylation of CDK1 (CDK1-Y15) and serine phosphorylation of Cdc25C (Cdc25C-S216) were upregulated after  infection.In our model,  inhibited the proliferation of hPDLFs and exerted an invasive effect, causing G2 phase arrest via the Cdc25C/CDK1/cyclin B1 signaling cascade. Its inhibitory effect on proliferation was stronger in the high-concentration group.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28334277>In bone metastasis miR-34a-5p absence inversely correlates with Met expression, while Met oncogene is unaffected by miR-34a-5p in non-metastatic and metastatic breast carcinomas.</a></h2><p>The highlight of the molecular basis and therapeutic targets of the bone-metastatic process requires the identification of biomarkers of metastasis . Here, we studied miR-34a-5p expression, and Met-receptor expression and localization in bone metastases from ductal breast carcinomas, and in ductal carcinomas without history of metastasis (20 cases). miR-34a-5p was elevated in non-metastatic breast carcinoma, intermediate in the adjacent tissue and practically absent in bone metastases, opposite to pair-matched carcinoma. Met-receptor biomarker was highly expressed and inversely correlated with miR-34a-5p using the same set of bone-metastasis tissues. The miR-34a-5p silencing might depend on aberrant-epigenetic mechanisms of plastic-bone metastases, since in 1833 cells under methyltransferase blockade miR-34a-5p augmented. In fact, 1833 cells showed very low endogenous miR-34a-5p, in respect to parental MDA-MB231 breast carcinoma cells, and the restoration of miR-34a-5p with the mimic reduced Met and invasiveness. Notably, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-dependent Met stabilization was observed in bone-metastatic 1833 cells, consistent with Met co-distribution with the ligand HGF at plasma membrane and at nuclear levels in bone metastases. Met-protein level was higher in non-metastatic (low grade) than in metastatic (high grade) breast carcinomas, notwithstanding miR-34a-5p-elevated expression in both the specimens. Thus, mostly in non-metastatic carcinomas the elevated miR-34a-5p unaffected Met, important for invasive/mesenchymal phenotype, while possibly targeting some stemness biomarkers related to metastatic phenotype. In personalized therapies against bone metastasis, we suggest miR-34a-5p as a suitable target of epigenetic reprogramming leading to the accumulation of miR-34a-5p and the down-regulation of Met- kinase, a key player of the bone-metastatic process.© The Author 2017.

Meningitis is one of the major clinical manifestations of SS2 infection. However, the specific process of SS2 meningitis and its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been reported to initiate transduction of intracellular signals and regulate host inflammatory responses. Whether and how EGFR contributes to the development of S. suis meningitis are currently unknown.The  phosphorylation of cellular proteins, the transactivation of EGFR, as well as its dimerization, and the associated signal transduction pathways were investigated by immunoprecipitation and western blotting. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to investigate the transcriptional level of the ErbB family members, EGFR-related ligands, cytokines, and chemokines. The secretion of cytokines and chemokines in the serum and brain were detected by Q-Plex™ Chemiluminescent ELISA.We found an important role of EGFR in SS2 strain SC19-induced meningitis. SC19 increasingly adhered to human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMEC) and caused inflammatory lesions in the brain tissues, with significant induction and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the serum and brains. SC19 infection of hBMEC induced  phosphorylation of cellular EGFR in a ligand-dependent manner involving the EGF-like ligand HB-EGF, amphiregulin (AREG), and epiregulin (EREG) and led to heterodimerization of EGFR/ErbB3. The EGFR transactivation did not participate in SS2 strain SC19 adhesion of hBMEC, as well as in bacterial  in vivo. However, its transactivation contributed to the bacterial-induced neuroinflammation, via triggering the MAPK-ERK1/2 and NF-κB signaling pathways in hBMEC that promote the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.We investigated for the first time the  phosphorylation of cellular proteins in response to SS2 strain SC19 infection of hBMEC and demonstrated the contribution of EGFR to SS2-induced neuroinflammation. These observations propose a novel mechanism involving EGFR in SS2-mediated inflammatory responses in the brain, and therefore, EGFR might be an important host target for further investigation and prevention of neuroinflammation caused by SS2 strains.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29509331>Tandem  phosphosites in the Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli chaperone CesT are required for differential type III effector translocation and virulence.</a></h2><p>Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) use a type 3 secretion system (T3SS) for injection of effectors into host cells and intestinal . Here, we demonstrate that the multicargo chaperone CesT has two strictly conserved  phosphosites, Y152 and Y153 that regulate differential effector secretion in EPEC. Conservative substitution of both  residues to phenylalanine strongly attenuated EPEC type 3 effector injection into host cells, and limited Tir effector mediated intimate adherence during infection. EPEC expressing a CesT Y152F variant were deficient for NleA effector expression and exhibited significantly reduced translocation of NleA into host cells during infection. Other effectors were observed to be dependent on CesT Y152 for maximal translocation efficiency. Unexpectedly, EPEC expressing a CesT Y153F variant exhibited significantly enhanced effector translocation of many CesT-interacting effectors, further implicating phosphosites Y152 and Y153 in CesT functionality. A mouse infection model of intestinal disease using Citrobacter rodentium revealed that CesT  substitution variants displayed delayed  and were more rapidly cleared from the intestine. These data demonstrate genetically separable functions for tandem  phosphosites within CesT. Therefore, CesT via its C-terminal  phosphosites, has relevant roles beyond typical type III secretion chaperones that interact and stabilize effector proteins.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28611953>Bronchial Epithelial Cells from Cystic Fibrosis Patients Express a Specific Long Non-coding RNA Signature upon  Infection.</a></h2><p> () is the leading cause of chronic lung infection in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients.

The anti-platelet agent tirofiban stimulates endothelial cell migration and proliferation, mediated by VEGF production. We investigated the tirofiban effect on the migration and adhesion of endothelial cells to BVS, in vitro. We performed human umbilical endothelial cell (HUVEC) cultures in the presence of BVS. Tirofiban, similarly to VEGF, increased the ability of HUVEC to grow on the vascular scaffold, compared to unstimulated or abciximab-treated cells. Tirofiban increased HUVEC expression of β1 and β3 integrins along with collagen and fibronectin. A role for β1 integrin in the "pro-adhesive and -migratory" signals elicited by tirofiban was suggested by use of an anti-β1-blocking antibody that prevented poly-levo-lactic acid vascular scaffold .

Accordingly, the human pathogen enterohemorrhagic  (EHEC) employs a complex multifaceted regulatory network to link the expression of type III secretion system (T3SS) components to nutrient availability. While phosphorylation of histidine and aspartate residues on two-component system response regulators is recognized as an integral part of bacterial signaling, the involvement of phosphotyrosine-mediated control is minimally explored in Gram-negative pathogens. Our recent phosphotyrosine profiling study of  identified 342 phosphorylated proteins, indicating that phosphotyrosine modifications in bacteria are more prevalent than previously anticipated. The present study demonstrates that  phosphorylation of a metabolite-responsive LacI/GalR family regulator, Cra, negatively affects T3SS expression under glycolytic conditions that are typical for the colonic lumen environment where production of the T3SS is unnecessary. Our data suggest that Cra phosphorylation affects T3SS expression by modulating the expression of , which encodes the major activator of EHEC virulence gene expression. Phosphorylation of the Cra Y47 residue diminishes DNA binding to fine-tune the expression of virulence-associated genes, including those of the locus of enterocyte effacement pathogenicity island that encode the T3SS, and thereby negatively affects the formation of attaching and effacing lesions. Our data indicate that  phosphorylation provides an additional mechanism to control the DNA binding of Cra and other LacI/GalR family regulators, including LacI and PurR. This study describes an initial effort to unravel the role of global phosphotyrosine signaling in the control of EHEC virulence potential. Enterohemorrhagic  (EHEC) causes outbreaks of hemorrhagic colitis and the potentially fatal hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Successful host  by EHEC relies on the ability to coordinate the expression of virulence factors in response to environmental cues. A complex network that integrates environmental signals at multiple regulatory levels tightly controls virulence gene expression. We demonstrate that EHEC utilizes a previously uncharacterized phosphotyrosine signaling pathway through Cra to fine-tune the expression of virulence-associated genes to effectively control T3SS production. This study demonstrates that  phosphorylation negatively affects the DNA-binding capacity of Cra, which affects the expression of genes related to virulence and metabolism. We demonstrate for the first time that phosphotyrosine-mediated control affects global transcription in EHEC. Our data provide insight into a hitherto unexplored regulatory level of the global network controlling EHEC virulence gene expression.Copyright © 2018 Robertson et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30087170>Identification and Characterization of a Phase-Variable Element That Regulates the Autotransporter UpaE in Uropathogenic Escherichia coli.</a></h2><p>Uropathogenic  (UPEC) is the most common etiologic agent of uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI). An important mechanism of gene regulation in UPEC is phase variation that involves inversion of a promoter-containing DNA element via enzymatic activity of  recombinases, resulting in biphasic, ON or OFF expression of target genes. The UPEC reference strain CFT073 has five  site-specific recombinases that function at two previously characterized promoter inversion systems,  and  Three of the five recombinases are located proximally to their cognate target elements, which is typical of promoter inversion systems. The genes for the other two recombinases, IpuA and IpuB, are located distal from these sites. Here, we identified and characterized a third phase-variable invertible element in CFT073, , located proximal to  and  The inversion of  is catalyzed by four of the five CFT073 recombinases. Orientation of the element drives transcription of a two-gene operon containing , a predicted LuxR-type regulator, and , a predicted autotransporter. We show that the predicted autotransporter UpaE is surface located and facilitates biofilm formation as well as adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins in a K-12 recombinant background. Consistent with this phenotype, the  ON condition in CFT073 results in defective swimming motility, increased adherence to human kidney epithelial cells, and a positive competitive kidney  advantage in experimental mouse UTIs. Overall, the identification of a third phase switch in UPEC that is regulated by a shared set of recombinases describes a complex phase-variable virulence network in UPEC. Uropathogenic  (UPEC) is the most common cause of urinary tract infection (UTI). ON versus OFF phase switching by inversion of small DNA elements at two chromosome sites in UPEC regulates the expression of important virulence factors, including the type 1 fimbria adhesion organelle.

The aim of this study was to explore small molecules for treating colorectal cancer (CRC) and to investigate their anti-metastatic mechanisms. In this study, six CRC cell lines were used. We showed that YH-306 significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of CRC cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, YH-306 inhibited cell adhesion and protrusion formation of HCT116 and HT-29 CRC cells. Moreover, YH-306 potently suppressed uninhibited proliferation in all six CRC cell lines tested and induced cell apoptosis in four cell lines. Furthermore, YH-306 inhibited CRC  in vitro and suppressed CRC growth in a xenograft mouse model, as well as hepatic/pulmonary metastasis in vivo. YH-306 suppressed the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), c-Src, paxillin, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K), Rac1 and the expression of matrix metalloproteases (MMP) 2 and MMP9. Meanwhile, YH-306 also inhibited actin-related protein (Arp2/3) complex-mediated actin polymerization. Taken together, YH-306 is a candidate drug in preventing growth and metastasis of CRC by modulating FAK signalling pathway.© 2015 The Authors.

As a Salmonella Type III secretion system (T3SS) effector, Salmonella protein  phosphatase (SptP) is critical for virulence in this genus. To investigate the feasibility of using C50336ΔsptP as a live attenuated oral vaccine in mice, we generated the sptP gene deletion mutant C50336ΔsptP in S.

Compared to wild-type C50336, C50336ΔsptP showed reduced virulence as confirmed by the 50% lethal dose (LD) in orally infected mice. C50336ΔsptP also showed decreased bacterial  both in vivo and in vitro. Immunization with C50336ΔsptP had no significant effect on body weight and did not result in obvious clinical symptoms relative to control animals treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), but induced humoral and cellular immune responses at 12 and 26 days post inoculation. Immunization with 1 × 10 colony-forming units (CFU) C50336ΔsptP per mouse provided 100% protection against subsequent challenge with the wild-type C50336 strain, and immunized mice showed mild and temporary clinical symptoms as compared to those of control group.These results demonstrate that C50336ΔsptP can be a live attenuated oral vaccine for salmonellosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30550556>Enteropathogenic E. coli relies on collaboration between the formin mDia1 and the Arp2/3 complex for actin pedestal biogenesis and maintenance.</a></h2><p>Enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EPEC and EHEC) are closely related extracellular pathogens that reorganize host cell actin into "pedestals" beneath the tightly adherent bacteria. This pedestal-forming activity is both a critical step in pathogenesis, and it makes EPEC and EHEC useful models for studying the actin rearrangements that underlie membrane protrusions. To generate pedestals, EPEC relies on the  phosphorylated bacterial effector protein Tir to bind host adaptor proteins that recruit N-WASP, a nucleation-promoting factor that activates the Arp2/3 complex to drive actin polymerization. In contrast, EHEC depends on the effector EspFU to multimerize N-WASP and promote Arp2/3 activation. Although these core pathways of pedestal assembly are well-characterized, the contributions of additional actin nucleation factors are unknown. We investigated potential cooperation between the Arp2/3 complex and other classes of nucleators using chemical inhibitors, siRNAs, and knockout cell lines. We found that inhibition of formins impairs actin pedestal assembly, motility, and cellular  for bacteria using the EPEC, but not the EHEC, pathway of actin polymerization. We also identified mDia1 as the formin contributing to EPEC pedestal assembly, as its expression level positively correlates with the efficiency of pedestal formation, and it localizes to the base of pedestals both during their initiation and once they have reached steady state. Collectively, our data suggest that mDia1 enhances EPEC pedestal biogenesis and maintenance by generating seed filaments to be used by the N-WASP-Arp2/3-dependent actin nucleation machinery and by sustaining Src-mediated phosphorylation of Tir.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29215078>Melanization in response to wounding is ancestral in arthropods and conserved in albino cave species.</a></h2><p>Many species adapted to aphotic subterranean habitats have lost all body pigmentation. Yet, melanization is an important component of wound healing in arthropods. We amputated appendages in a variety of cave-adapted and surface-dwelling arthropods. A dark clot formed at the site of injury in most species tested, including even albino cave-adapted species. The dark coloration of the clots was due to melanin deposition. The speed of wound melanization was uncorrelated with a difference in metabolic rate between surface and cave populations of an amphipod. The chelicerate Limulus polyphemus, all isopod crustaceans tested, and the cave shrimp Troglocaris anophthalmus did not melanize wounds. The loss of wound melanization in T. anophthalmus was an apomorphy associated with adaptation to subterranean habitats, but in isopods it appeared to be a symplesiomorphy unrelated to  of subterranean habitats. We conclude that wound melanization i) is an important part of innate immunity because it was present in all major arthropod lineages, ii) is retained in most albino cave species, and iii) has been lost several times during arthropod evolution, indicating melanization is not an indispensable component of wound healing in arthropods.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30675019>Absence of gut microbial  attenuates the sympathoadrenal response to hypoglycemic stress in mice: implications for human neonates.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota plays an important role during early development via bidirectional gut-brain signaling. Catecholamines provide a survival advantage allowing adaptation to common postnatal stressors. We aimed to explore the potential link between gut microbiota/gut-derived metabolites and sympathoadrenal stress responsivity.The effect of insulin-induced hypoglycemia was compared in mice with (control, adapted control) and without microbiome (germ-free, GF). Counter-regulatory hormones were analyzed in urine and plasma. Adrenal gene expression levels were evaluated and correlated to cecal short chain fatty acids (SCFA) content.There was a significant association between absent microbiota/SCFA and epinephrine levels at baseline and after stress.

Hypoglycemia-induced c-Fos (marker of trans-synaptic neuronal activation) in both conditions. Delayed increases in adrenal  hydroxylase and neuropeptide Y messenger RNA were observed in GF mice. Transcriptome analysis provided insight into underlying mechanisms for attenuated epinephrine production and release.Lack of microbiome selectively impaired adrenal catecholamine responses to hypoglycemia. We speculate that absent/delayed acquisition of flora (e.g., after antibiotic exposure) may compromise sympathoadrenal stress responsivity.

Women in their sixth to eighth decades are commonly affected.

Phomopsis liquidambari B3 can establish mutualistic symbiosis with a broad spectrum of crop plants. Colonizing dynamics observations and a growth promotion assay of rice and Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that the B3  strategy is host-adapted and resulted in different growth promotions influenced by N availability. However, the biochemical mechanisms and underlying genetics of the saprophyte transition to an endophyte are poorly understood. Here, the transcriptome features of generalist P. liquidambari and highlighted gene sets involved in the lifestyle transition from saprophytism to endophytism were reported. Most notable were genes for translation, ribosome biogenesis and MAPK signaling, several of which were only up-regulated in endophytic B3. Coordinated up-regulation of genes encoding enzymes involved in phenylalanine,  and tryptophan biosynthesis were preceded by secondary metabolite induction, which was encountered with host defense. Quantitative PCR validates the reliability of RNA-seq.

To trigger pedestal formation, EPEC employs the  phosphorylated transmembrane receptor Tir, while EHEC relies on the multivalent scaffolding protein EspFU. The ability to generate these structures correlates with bacterial  in several animal models, but the precise function of pedestals in infection remains unclear. To address this uncertainty, we characterized the  properties of EPEC and EHEC during infection of polarized epithelial cells. We found that EPEC and EHEC both formed distinct bacterial communities, or "macrocolonies," that encompassed multiple host cells. Tir and EspFU, as well as the host Arp2/3 complex, were all critical for the expansion of macrocolonies over time. Unexpectedly, EspFU accelerated the formation of larger macrocolonies compared to EPEC Tir, as EspFU-mediated actin assembly drove faster bacterial motility to cell junctions, where bacteria formed a secondary pedestal on a neighboring cell and divided, allowing one of the daughters to disengage and infect the second cell. Collectively, these data reveal that EspFU enhances epithelial  by increasing actin-based motility and promoting an efficient method of cell-to-cell transmission.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31000483>Ixodes scapularis Src  kinase facilitates Anaplasma phagocytophilum survival in its arthropod vector.</a></h2><p>Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the agent of human anaplasmosis, is an obligate intracellular bacterium that uses multiple survival strategies to persist in Ixodes scapularis ticks. Our previous study showed that A. phagocytophilum efficiently induced the  phosphorylation of several Ixodes proteins that includes extended phosphorylation of actin at  residue Y178. In order to identify the  kinase responsible for the A. phagocytophilum induced  phosphorylation of proteins, we combed the I. scapularis genome and identified a non-receptor Src  kinase ortholog. I. scapularis Src kinase showed high degree of amino acid sequence conservation with Dsrc from Drosophila melanogaster. We noted that at different developmental stages of I. scapularis ticks, larvae expressed significantly higher levels of src transcripts in comparison to the other stages. We found that A. phagocytophilum significantly reduced Src levels in unfed nymphs and in nymphs while blood feeding (48 h during feeding) in comparison to the levels noted to relative uninfected controls. However, A. phagocytophilum increased Src levels in fully engorged larvae and nymphs (48 h post feeding) and in vitro tick cells in comparison to the relative uninfected controls. Inhibition of Src kinase expression and activity by treatment with src-dsRNA or Src-inhibitor, respectively, significantly reduced A. phagocytophilum loads in ticks and tick cells.

The underlying mechanism may involve the alterations of the intrinsic negative regulation in tumor cells. Here we report that the differential expression of interleukin-37b (IL-37b) in tumor cells alters the intrinsic negative regulation of signaling pathways, resulting in the difference of metastatic capacity. IL-37b could bind Smad3 and suppress Smad pathway by interfering with the formation and nuclear translocation of Smad2/3/4 complex. In turn, Smad3 could function as a co-regulator, enabling IL-37b to suppress multiple non-Smad pathways. IL-37b-Smad3 translocated into nucleus to upregulate the expression of non-receptor protein  phosphatases (PTPNs), thus promoting dephosphorylation to suppress the activation of  phosphorylation-dependent signaling pathways such as ERK, p38 MAPK, JNK, PI3K, NF-κB, and STAT3 pathways. Intriguingly, 13 of 17 PTPNs, most of which are metastasis suppressors, were downregulated in metastatic tumor cells because of the low expression of IL-37b. The marked decrease of intracellular IL-37b attenuated the intrinsic negative regulation in tumor cells, resulting in the enhanced activation of multiple signaling pathways and the increased capacity of invasiveness and metastatic . Consistently, low expression of IL-37b in tumors was significantly associated with poor prognosis of cancer patients. Taken together, these findings reveal that intracellular IL-37b is a critical factor in the negative regulation of multiple signaling pathways that modulate the expression of metastasis-related genes, and suggest that IL-37b expression in tumor cells can potentially be a histopathological prognostic parameter for cancer patients and a therapeutic target for preventing tumor metastasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25690013>The  phosphatase PTPN14 (Pez) inhibits metastasis by altering protein trafficking.</a></h2><p>Factors secreted by tumor cells shape the local microenvironment to promote invasion and metastasis, as well as condition the premetastatic niche to enable secondary-site  and growth. In addition to this secretome, tumor cells have increased abundance of growth-promoting receptors at the cell surface. We found that the  phosphatase PTPN14 (also called Pez, which is mutated in various cancers) suppressed metastasis by reducing intracellular protein trafficking through the secretory pathway. Knocking down PTPN14 in tumor cells or injecting the peritoneum of mice with conditioned medium from PTPN14-deficient cell cultures promoted the growth and metastasis of breast cancer xenografts. Loss of catalytically functional PTPN14 increased the secretion of growth factors and cytokines, such as IL-8 (interleukin-8), and increased the abundance of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) at the cell surface of breast cancer cells and of FLT4 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3) at the cell surface of primary lymphatic endothelial cells. We identified RIN1 (Ras and Rab interactor 1) and PRKCD (protein kinase C-δ) as binding partners and substrates of PTPN14. Similar to cells overexpressing PTPN14, receptor trafficking to the cell surface was inhibited in cells that lacked PRKCD or RIN1 or expressed a nonphosphorylatable RIN1 mutant, and cytokine secretion was decreased in cells treated with PRKCD inhibitors. Invasive breast cancer tissue had decreased expression of PTPN14, and patient survival was worse when tumors had increased expression of the genes encoding RIN1 or PRKCD. Thus, PTPN14 prevents metastasis by restricting the trafficking of both soluble and membrane-bound proteins.Copyright © 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28139032>Pigmented apocrine hamartoma of the vulva: A case report.</a></h2><p>We herein report a patient who clinically presented with a pigmented, flat plaque in the vulvar area.

In this study, we used a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance-guided structure-activity relationships along with biochemical and cellular studies to derive a novel tumor-homing agent, named 123B9, targeting the EphA2  kinase receptor ligand-binding domain. Conjugating 123B9 to the chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel (PTX) via a stable linker results in an agent that is significantly more effective than the unconjugated drug in both a pancreatic cancer xenograft model and a melanoma lung  and metastases model.

However, the underlying mechanism regulating differential CPS expression remains unclear. CPS synthesis requires energy that is supplied by ATP. Previously, we demonstrated a correlation between ATP levels and adenylate kinase in S. pneumoniae (SpAdK). A dose-dependent induction of SpAdK in serum was also reported. To meet medical needs, this study aimed to elucidate the role of SpAdK in the regulation of CPS production. CPS levels in S. pneumoniae type 2 (D39) increased proportionally with SpAdK levels, but they were not related to pneumococcal autolysis. Moreover, increased SpAdK levels resulted in increased total  kinase Cps2D levels and phosphorylated Cps2D, which is a regulator of CPS synthesis in the D39 strain. Our results also indicated that the SpAdK and Cps2D proteins interact in the presence of Mg-ATP. In addition, in silico analysis uncovered the mechanism behind this protein-protein interaction, suggesting that SpAdK binds with the Cps2D dimer. This established the importance of the ATP-binding domain of Cps2D.

In this study, we identified a scaffold protein, FAM120A (C9ORF10), as a signaling partner in this process. FAM120A was overexpressed in human colon cancer cell lines and 55% of human colon cancer specimens. IL13Rα2-FAM120A coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed further signaling network associations that could regulate the activity of IL13Rα2, including FAK, SRC, PI3K, G-protein-coupled receptors, and TRAIL receptors. In addition, FAM120A associated with kinesins and motor proteins involved in cargo movement along microtubules. IL13Rα2-triggered activation of the FAK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways was mediated by FAM120A, which also recruited PI3K and functioned as a scaffold protein to enable phosphorylation and activation of PI3K by Src family kinases. FAM120A silencing abolished IL13-induced cell migration, invasion, and survival. Finally, antibody blockade of IL13Rα2 or FAM120A silencing precluded liver  in nude mice or metastasis.

In this study, we investigated the expression and role of DDR1 in human gastric cancer metastasis. Proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation assays were conducted in DDR1-expressing MKN74 gastric cancer cells and corresponding DDR1-silenced cells. The effects of DDR1 on tumor growth and metastasis were examined in orthotopically implanted and experimental liver metastasis models in nude mice. The expression of DDR1 in surgical specimens was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. DDR1 was expressed in human gastric cancer cell lines, and its expression in human gastric tumors was associated with poor prognosis. Among seven gastric cancer cell lines, MKN74 expressed the highest levels of DDR1. DDR1-silenced MKN74 cells showed unaltered proliferation activity. In contrast, migration, invasion, and tube formation were significantly reduced. When examined in an orthotopic nude mouse model, DDR1-silenced implanted tumors significantly reduced angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, thereby leading to reductions in lymph node metastasis and liver metastasis. In a model of experimental liver metastasis, DDR1-silenced cells almost completely inhibited liver  and metastasis. DDR1 deficiency led to reduced expression of the genes encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, VEGF-C, and platelet-derived growth factor-B. These results suggest that DDR1 is involved in gastric cancer tumor progression and that silencing of DDR1 inhibits multiple steps of the gastric cancer metastasis process.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Here, using transcriptional profiling of tumours and matched metastases in patient-derived xenograft models in mice, we show cancer-site-specific phenotypes and increased glucocorticoid receptor activity in distant metastases. The glucocorticoid receptor mediates the effects of stress hormones, and of synthetic derivatives of these hormones that are used widely in the clinic as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. We show that the increase in stress hormones during breast cancer progression results in the activation of the glucocorticoid receptor at distant metastatic sites, increased  and reduced survival. Our transcriptomics, proteomics and phospho-proteomics studies implicate the glucocorticoid receptor in the activation of multiple processes in metastasis and in the increased expression of kinase ROR1, both of which correlate with reduced survival. The ablation of ROR1 reduced metastatic outgrowth and prolonged survival in preclinical models. Our results indicate that the activation of the glucocorticoid receptor increases heterogeneity and metastasis, which suggests that caution is needed when using glucocorticoids to treat patients with breast cancer who have developed cancer-related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27230228>Extrinsic innervation of ileum and pelvic flexure of foals with ileocolonic aganglionosis.</a></h2><p>Equine ileocolonic aganglionosis, which is also called lethal white foal syndrome (LWFS), is a severe congenital condition characterized by the unsuccessful  of neural crest progenitors in the caudal part of the small intestine and the entire large intestine. LWFS, which is attributable to a mutation in the endothelin receptor B gene, is the horse equivalent of Hirschsprung's disease in humans. Affected foals suffer from aganglionosis or hypoganglionosis of the enteric ganglia resulting in intestinal akinesia and colic. In other species with aganglionosis, fibers of extrinsic origin show an abnormal distribution pattern within the gut wall, but we have no information to date regarding this occurrence in horses. Our present aim is to investigate the distribution of extrinsic sympathetic and sensory neural fibers in LWFS, focusing on ileum and the pelvic flexure of the colon of two LWFS foals compared with a control subject. The sympathetic fibers were immunohistochemically identified with the markers  hydroxylase and dopamine beta-hydroxylase. The extrinsic sensory fibers were identified with the markers Substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Since SP and CGRP are also synthesized by subclasses of horse intramural neurons, LWFS represents a good model for the selective study of extrinsic fiber distribution. Affected foals showed large bundles of extrinsic fibers, compared with the control, as observed in Hirschsprung's disease. Furthermore, altered adrenergic pathways were observed, prominently in the pelvic flexure. The numbers of SP- and CGRP-immunoreactive fibers in the muscle, a target of enteric neurons, were dramatically reduced, whereas fibers deduced to be extrinsic sensory axons persisted around submucosal blood vessels. Fiber numbers in the mucosa were reduced. Thus, extrinsic innervation, contributing to modulate enteric functions, might also be affected during LWFS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30745299>Bad to the Bone: The Role of the Insulin-Like Growth Factor Axis in Osseous Metastasis.</a></h2><p>Bone metastases are a frequent complication of cancer that are associated with considerable morbidity. Current treatments may temporarily palliate the symptoms of bone metastases but often fail to delay their progression. Bones provide a permissive environment because they are characterized by dynamic turnover, secreting factors required for bone maintenance but also stimulating the establishment and growth of metastases. Insulin-like growth factors (IGF) are the most abundant growth factors in bone and are required for normal skeletal development and function. Via activation of the IGF-1 receptors (IGF-1R) and variant insulin receptors, IGFs promote cancer progression, aggressiveness, and treatment resistance. Of specific relevance to bone biology, IGFs contribute to the homing, dormancy, , and expansion of bone metastases. Furthermore, preclinical evidence suggests that tumor cells can be primed to metastasize to bone by a high IGF-1 environment in the primary tumor, suggesting that bone metastases may reflect IGF dependency. Therapeutic targeting of the IGF axis may therefore provide an effective method for treating bone metastases. Indeed, anti-IGF-1R antibodies, IGF-1R  kinase inhibitors, and anti-IGF-1/2 antibodies have demonstrated antitumor activity in preclinical models of prostate and breast cancer metastases, either alone or in combination with other agents. Several studies suggest that such treatments can inhibit bone metastases without affecting growth of the primary tumor. Although previous trials of anti-IGF-1R drugs have generated negative results in unselected patients, these considerations suggest that future clinical trials of IGF-targeted agents may be warranted in patients with bone metastases.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27354551>Evaluation of the Antimicrobial Efficacy of a Novel Rifampin/Minocycline-Coated, Noncrosslinked Porcine Acellular Dermal Matrix Compared With Uncoated Scaffolds for Soft Tissue Repair.</a></h2><p>Background Despite meticulous aseptic technique and systemic antibiotics, bacterial  of mesh remains a critical issue in hernia repair. A novel minocycline/rifampin -coated, noncrosslinked porcine acellular dermal matrix (XenMatrix AB) was developed to protect the device from microbial  for up to 7 days. The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial efficacy of this device against clinically isolated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Escherichia coli. Methods XenMatrix AB was compared with 5 existing uncoated soft tissue repair devices using in vitro methods of zone of inhibition (ZOI) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at 24 hours following inoculation with MRSA or E coli These devices were also evaluated at 7 days following dorsal implantation and inoculation with MRSA or E coli (60 male New Zealand white rabbits, n = 10 per group) for viable colony-forming units (CFU), abscess formation and histopathologic response, respectively. Results In vitro studies demonstrated a median ZOI of 36 mm for MRSA and 16 mm for E coli for XenMatrix AB, while all uncoated devices showed no inhibition of bacterial growth (0 mm). SEM also demonstrated no visual evidence of MRSA or E coli  on the surface of XenMatrix AB compared with  of all other uncoated devices. In vivo XenMatrix AB demonstrated complete inhibition of bacterial , no abscess formation, and a reduced inflammatory response compared with uncoated devices. Conclusion We demonstrated that XenMatrix AB possesses potent in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial efficacy against clinically isolated MRSA and E coli compared with uncoated devices.© The Author(s) 2016.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25392346>The TWEAK Receptor Fn14 Is an Src-Inducible Protein and a Positive Regulator of Src-Driven Cell Invasion.</a></h2><p>The TNF receptor superfamily member Fn14 (TNFRSF12A) is the sole signaling receptor for the proinflammatory cytokine TWEAK (TNFSF12).Fn14 engagement stimulates multiple signal transduction pathways, including the NF-κB pathway, and this triggers important cellular processes (e.g., growth, differentiation, migration, and invasion). The TWEAK-Fn14 axis is thought to be a major physiologic mediator of tissue repair after acute injury. Various studies have revealed that Fn14 is highly expressed in many solid tumor types, and that Fn14 signaling may play a role in tumor growth and metastasis. Previously, it was shown that Fn14 levels are frequently elevated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors and cell lines that exhibit constitutive EGFR phosphorylation (activation). Furthermore, elevated Fn14 levels increased NSCLC cell invasion in vitro and lung metastatic tumor  in vivo. The present study reveals that EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells that express high levels of Fn14 exhibit constitutive activation of the cytoplasmic  kinase Src, and that treatment with the Src family kinase (SFK) inhibitor dasatinib decreases Fn14 gene expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Importantly, siRNA-mediated depletion of the SFK member Src in NSCLC cells also decreases Fn14 expression. Finally, expression of the constitutively active v-Src oncoprotein in NIH 3T3 cells induces Fn14 gene expression, and NIH 3T3/v-Src cells require Fn14 expression for full invasive capacity.These results indicate that oncogenic Src may contribute to Fn14 overexpression in solid tumors, and that Src-mediated cell invasion could potentially be inhibited with Fn14-targeted therapeutics.©2014 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29078343>Dual origin of enteric neurons in vagal Schwann cell precursors and the sympathetic neural crest.</a></h2><p>Most of the enteric nervous system derives from the "vagal" neural crest, lying at the level of somites 1-7, which invades the digestive tract rostro-caudally from the foregut to the hindgut. Little is known about the initial phase of this , which brings enteric precursors into the foregut. Here we show that the "vagal crest" subsumes two populations of enteric precursors with contrasted origins, initial modes of migration, and destinations. Crest cells adjacent to somites 1 and 2 produce Schwann cell precursors that colonize the vagus nerve, which in turn guides them into the esophagus and stomach. Crest cells adjacent to somites 3-7 belong to the crest streams contributing to sympathetic chains: they migrate ventrally, seed the sympathetic chains, and colonize the entire digestive tract thence. Accordingly, enteric ganglia, like sympathetic ones, are atrophic when deprived of signaling through the  kinase receptor ErbB3, while half of the esophageal ganglia require, like parasympathetic ones, the nerve-associated form of the ErbB3 ligand, Neuregulin-1.

Although much is known about the mechanisms and route of Campylobacter spp.  in poultry, the literature is scarce on antibiotic-free solutions to combat Campylobacter spp.  in poultry. In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to investigate the role of TYPLEX® Chelate (ferric ), a novel feed additive, in inhibiting Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) biofilm formation and reducing C. jejuni and Escherichia coli (E. coli)  in broiler chickens at market age. In an in vitro study, the inhibitory effect on C. jejuni biofilm formation using a plastic bead assay was investigated. The results demonstrated that TYPLEX® Chelate significantly reduces biofilm formation. In an in vivo study, 800 broilers (one d old) were randomly allocated to 4 dietary treatments in a randomized block design, each having 10 replicate pens with 20 birds per pen. At d 21, all birds were challenged with C. jejuni via seeded litter. At d 42, cecal samples were collected and tested for volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations and C. jejuni and E. coli counts. The results showed that TYPLEX® Chelate reduced the carriage of C. jejuni and E. coli in poultry by 2 and 1 log10 per gram cecal sample, respectively, and increased cecal VFA concentrations. These findings support TYPLEX® Chelate as a novel non-antibiotic feed additive that may help produce poultry with a lower public health risk of Campylobacteriosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25775272>Phytosulfokine Is Involved in Positive Regulation of Lotus japonicus Nodulation.</a></h2><p>Phytosulfokine (PSK) is a -sulfated peptide that is widely distributed in plants, participating in cell proliferation, differentiation, and innate immunity. The potential role of PSK in nodulation in legumes has not been reported. In this work, five PSK precursor genes were identified in Lotus japonicas, designated as LjPSK1 to LjPSK5. Three of them (LjPSK1, LjPSK4, and LjPSK5) were found to be expressed in nitrogen-fixing root nodules. LjPSK1 and LjPSK4 were not induced at the early stage of nodulation. Interestingly, while the expression of LjPSK4 was also found in spontaneous nodules without rhizobial , LjPSK1 was not induced in these pseudo nodules. Promoter-β-glucuronidase analysis revealed that LjPSK1 was highly expressed in enlarged symbiotic cells of nodules. Exogenous addition of 1 1M synthetic PSK peptide resulted in increased nodule numbers per plant. Consistently, the number of mature nodules but not the events of rhizobial infection and nodule initiation was increased by overexpressing LjPSK1 in transgenic hairy roots, in which the expression of jasmonate-responsive genes was found to be repressed. These results suggest that PSK is a new peptide signal that regulates nodulation in legumes, probably through cross-talking with other phytohormones.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26670048>Mesenchymal Cancer Cell-Stroma Crosstalk Promotes Niche Activation, Epithelial Reversion, and Metastatic .</a></h2><p>During metastatic , tumor cells must establish a favorable microenvironment or niche that will sustain their growth. However, both the temporal and molecular details of this process remain poorly understood. Here, we found that metastatic initiating cells (MICs) exhibit a high capacity for lung fibroblast activation as a result of Thrombospondin 2 (THBS2) expression. Importantly, inhibiting the mesenchymal phenotype of MICs by blocking the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated kinase AXL reduces THBS2 secretion, niche-activating ability, and, consequently, metastatic competence. Subsequently, disseminated metastatic cells revert to an AXL-negative, more epithelial phenotype to proliferate and decrease the phosphorylation levels of TGF-β-dependent SMAD2-3 in favor of BMP/SMAD1-5 signaling. Remarkably, newly activated fibroblasts promote this transition. In summary, our data reveal a crosstalk between cancer cells and their microenvironment whereby the EMT status initially triggers and then is regulated by niche activation during metastatic .Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

Therefore, it is critical to elucidate the biological mechanisms that underlie tumor progression and metastasis. Using signaling pathway signatures we previously predicted a role for E2F transcription factors in Myc induced tumors. To test this role we interbred MMTV-Myc transgenic mice with E2F knockouts. Surprisingly, we observed that the loss of E2F2 sharply increased the percentage of lung metastasis in MMTV-Myc transgenic mice. Examining the gene expression profile from these tumors, we identified genetic components that were potentially involved in mediating metastasis. These genes were filtered to uncover the genes involved in metastasis that also impacted distant metastasis free survival in human breast cancer. In order to elucidate the mechanism by which E2F2 loss enhanced metastasis we generated knockdowns of E2F2 in MDA-MB-231 cells and observed increased migration in vitro and increased lung  in vivo. We then examined genes that were differentially regulated between tumors from MMTV-Myc, MMTV-Myc E2F2-/-, and lung metastases samples and identified PTPRD. To test the role of PTPRD in E2F2-mediated breast cancer metastasis, we generated a knockdown of PTPRD in MDA-MB-231 cells. We noted that decreased levels of PTPRD resulted in decreased migration in vitro and decreased lung  in vivo. Taken together, these data indicate that E2F2 loss results in increased metastasis in breast cancer, potentially functioning through a PTPRD dependent mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26732977>Reconciling diverse mammalian pigmentation patterns with a fundamental mathematical model.</a></h2><p>Bands of colour extending laterally from the dorsal to ventral trunk are a common feature of mouse chimeras. These stripes were originally taken as evidence of the directed dorsoventral migration of melanoblasts (the embryonic precursors of melanocytes) as they colonize the developing skin. Depigmented 'belly spots' in mice with mutations in the receptor  kinase Kit are thought to represent a failure of this , either due to impaired migration or proliferation. Tracing of single melanoblast clones, however, has revealed a diffuse distribution with high levels of axial mixing--hard to reconcile with directed migration. Here we construct an agent-based stochastic model calibrated by experimental measurements to investigate the formation of diffuse clones, chimeric stripes and belly spots. Our observations indicate that melanoblast  likely proceeds through a process of undirected migration, proliferation and tissue expansion, and that reduced proliferation is the cause of the belly spots in Kit mutants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27302163>PTK6 Inhibition Suppresses Metastases of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer via SNAIL-Dependent E-Cadherin Regulation.</a></h2><p>Patients with triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) are at high risk for recurrent or metastatic disease despite standard treatment, underscoring the need for novel therapeutic targets and strategies. Here we report that protein  kinase 6 (PTK6) is expressed in approximately 70% of TNBCs where it acts to promote survival and metastatic lung . PTK6 downregulation in mesenchymal TNBC cells suppressed migration and three-dimensional culture growth, and enhanced anoikis, resistance to which is considered a prerequisite for metastasis. PTK6 downregulation restored E-cadherin levels via proteasome-dependent degradation of the E-cadherin repressor SNAIL. Beyond being functionally required in TNBC cells, kinase-active PTK6 also suppressed E-cadherin expression, promoted cell migration, and increased levels of mesenchymal markers in nontransformed MCF10A breast epithelial cells, consistent with a role in promoting an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). SNAIL downregulation and E-cadherin upregulation mediated by PTK6 inhibition induced anoikis, leading to impaired metastatic lung  in vivo Finally, effects of PTK6 downregulation were phenocopied by treatment with a recently developed PTK6 kinase inhibitor, further implicating kinase activity in regulation of EMT and metastases.

We previously found that colorectal cancer tumor-initiating cells (TICs) expressing CD110, the thrombopoietin (TPO)-binding receptor, mediate liver metastasis. Here, we show that TPO promotes metastasis of CD110+ TICs to the liver by activating lysine degradation. Lysine catabolism generates acetyl-CoA, which is used in p300-dependent LRP6 acetylation. This triggers  phosphorylation of LRP6, ultimately activating Wnt signaling to promote self-renewal of CD110+ TICs. Lysine catabolism also generates glutamate, which modulates the redox status of CD110+ TICs to promote liver  and drug resistance. Mechanistically, TPO-mediated induction of c-myc orchestrates recruitment of chromatin modifiers to regulate metabolic gene expression. Our findings, therefore, establish TPO as a component of the physiological environment critical for metastasis of colorectal cancer to the liver.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, the prevention and treatment of metastasis is an unmet clinical need. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an evolutionary conserved developmental program, which is induced during cancer progression and contributes to metastatic . EMT endows metastatic properties upon cancer cells by enhancing mobility, invasion, and resistance to apoptotic stimuli. Furthermore, EMT-derived tumor cells acquire stem cell properties and exhibit therapeutic resistance. The disseminated tumor cells recruited to distant organs are suggested to subsequently undergo an EMT reversion through mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET), necessary for efficient  and macrometastasis. A major focus of cancer research is to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying EMT/MET in tumor invasion, dissemination and metastasis.

Here we report that an integrin influences signalling of an RTK, c-Met, from inside the cell, to promote anchorage-independent cell survival. Thus, c-Met and β1-integrin co-internalize and become progressively recruited on LC3B-positive 'autophagy-related endomembranes' (ARE). In cells growing in suspension, β1-integrin promotes sustained c-Met-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation on ARE. This signalling is dependent on ATG5 and Beclin1 but not on ATG13, suggesting ARE belong to a non-canonical autophagy pathway. This β1-integrin-dependent c-Met-sustained signalling on ARE supports anchorage-independent cell survival and growth, tumorigenesis, invasion and lung  in vivo. RTK-integrin cooperation has been assumed to occur at the plasma membrane requiring integrin 'inside-out' or 'outside-in' signalling.

Persistent  of the stomach mucosa is facilitated by several mechanisms of immune evasion and immune modulation, such as avoidance of Toll-like receptor recognition or skewing of effector T cell responses. Interactions of H. pylori with different immune cells have been described with respect to immune cell activation, cytokine release, or oxidative burst induction. We show here that H. pylori infection of human granulocytes, or of HL-60 cells differentiated to a granulocyte-like phenotype (dHL-60 cells) results in inhibition of cell migration under different conditions. Migration of dHL-60 cells in a three-dimensional collagen gel was found to be inhibited independently of the cag pathogenicity island, whereas migration inhibition in an under agarose assay was dependent on the cag pathogenicity island, on its effector protein CagA, and on the outer membrane protein HopQ. CagA translocation into leukocytes is accompanied by its  phosphorylation and by proteolytic processing into an N-terminal 100 kDa and a C-terminal 35 kDa fragment at a distinct cleavage site. By using complemented H. pylori strains producing either phosphorylation-resistant or cleavage-resistant CagA variants, we show that CagA  phosphorylation is required for migration inhibition, but CagA processing is not. Our results suggest that direct contact of H. pylori with immune cells subverts not only their activation characteristics, but also their migratory behaviour.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Highly virulent  strains express the well-established adhesins BabA/B, SabA, AlpA/B, OipA, and HopQ, and a type IV secretion system (T4SS) encoded by the  pathogenicity island (PAI). The adhesins ascertain intimate bacterial contact to gastric epithelial cells, while the T4SS represents an extracellular pilus-like structure for the translocation of the effector protein CagA. Numerous T4SS components including CagI, CagL, CagY, and CagA have been shown to target the integrin-β₁ receptor followed by translocation of CagA across the host cell membrane. The interaction of CagA with membrane-anchored phosphatidylserine and CagA-containing outer membrane vesicles may also play a role in the delivery process. Translocated CagA undergoes  phosphorylation in C-terminal EPIYA-repeat motifs by oncogenic Src and Abl kinases. CagA then interacts with an array of host signaling proteins followed by their activation or inactivation in phosphorylation-dependent and phosphorylation-independent fashions.

We recently discovered that production of a key innate immune element, cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP), is stimulated via a NF-κB-dependent mechanism that is activated by S1P when S1P is generated by sphingosine kinase (SPHK) 1.We investigated whether pharmacological modulation of SPHK1 activity, using a novel synthetic SPHK1 activator, (S)-methyl 2-(hexanamide)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propanoate (MHP), stimulates CAMP expression.MHP-mediated changes in both S1P and CAMP downstream mediators were analyzed in normal cultured human KC by qRT-PCR, Western immunoblot, ELISA, confocal microscopy for immunohistochemistry, HPLC and ESI-LC/MS/MS, and microbial pathogen invasion/ in a human epidermal organotypic model.Treatment with MHP directly activated SPHK1 and increased cellular S1P content in normal cultured human KC. Because MHP did not inhibit S1P lyase activity, which hydrolyses S1P, augumented S1P levels could be attributed to increased synthesis rather than blockade of S1P degradation. Next, we found that exogenous MHP significantly stimulated CAMP mRNA and protein production in KC, increases that were significantly suppressed by siRNA directed against SPHK1, but not by a scrambled control siRNA. NF-κB activation, assessed by nuclear translocation of NF-κB, occurred in cells following incubation with MHP. Conversely, pretreatment with a specific inhibitor of SPHK1 decreased MHP-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB, and significantly attenuated the MHP-mediated increase in CAMP production. Finally, topical MHP significantly suppressed invasion of the virulent Staphylococcus aureus into murine skin explants.MHP activation of SPHK1, a target enzyme of CAMP production, can stimulate innate immunity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this study, we identified and characterized a genetic variant that hyperproduces a dark-brown pigment and was generated during Pseudoalteromonas lipolytica biofilm formation. Through whole-genome resequencing combined with targeted gene deletion and complementation, we found that a point mutation within the hmgA gene, which encodes homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase, is solely responsible for the overproduction of the dark-brown pigment pyomelanin. In P. lipolytica, inactivation of the hmgA gene led to the formation of extracellular pyomelanin and greatly reduced larval settlement and metamorphosis of the mussel Mytilus coruscus. Additionally, the extracted pyomelanin from the hmgA deletion mutant and the in vitro-synthesized pyomelanin also reduced larval settlement and metamorphosis of M. coruscus, suggesting that extracellular pyomelanin released from marine Pseudoalteromonas biofilm can inhibit the settlement of fouling organisms.© 2017 The Authors.

We investigated the interactions between the P. aeruginosa N-3-oxo-dodecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C12) quorum-sensing molecule and human airway epithelial cell gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC). C12 degradation and its effects on cells were monitored in various airway epithelial cell models grown under nonpolarized and polarized conditions. Its concentration was further monitored in daily tracheal aspirates of colonized intubated patients. C12 rapidly altered epithelial integrity and decreased GJIC in nonpolarized airway epithelial cells, whereas other quorum-sensing molecules had no effect. The effects of C12 were dependent on [Ca(2+)]i and could be prevented by inhibitors of Src  family and Rho-associated protein kinases. In contrast, polarized airway cells grown on Transwell filters were protected from C12 except when undergoing repair after wounding. In vivo during  of intubated patients, C12 did not accumulate, but it paralleled bacterial densities. In vitro C12 degradation, a reaction catalyzed by intracellular paraoxonase 2 (PON2), was impaired in nonpolarized cells, whereas PON2 expression was increased during epithelial polarization. The cytotoxicity of C12 on nonpolarized epithelial cells, combined with its impaired degradation allowing its accumulation, provides an additional pathogenic mechanism for P. aeruginosa infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27514986>Global transcriptional analysis suggests Lasiodiplodia theobromae pathogenicity factors involved in modulation of grapevine defensive response.</a></h2><p>Lasiodiplodia theobromae is a fungus of the Botryosphaeriaceae that causes grapevine vascular disease, especially in regions with hot climates. Fungi in this group often remain latent within their host and become virulent under abiotic stress. Transcriptional regulation analysis of L. theobromae exposed to heat stress (HS) was first carried out in vitro in the presence of grapevine wood (GW) to identify potential pathogenicity genes that were later evaluated for in planta expression.A total of 19,860 de novo assembled transcripts were obtained, forty-nine per cent of which showed homology to the Botryosphaeriaceae fungi, Neofusicoccum parvum or Macrophomina phaseolina. Three hundred ninety-nine have homology with genes involved in pathogenic processes and several belonged to expanded gene families in others fungal grapevine vascular pathogens. Gene expression analysis showed changes in fungal metabolism of phenolic compounds; where genes encoding for enzymes, with the ability to degrade salicylic acid (SA) and plant phenylpropanoid precursors, were up-regulated during in vitro HS response, in the presence of GW. These results suggest that the fungal  catabolism pathway could help the fungus to remove phenylpropanoid precursors thereby evading the host defense response. The in planta up-regulation of salicylate hydroxylase, intradiol ring cleavage dioxygenase and fumarylacetoacetase encoding genes, further supported this hypothesis. Those genes were even more up-regulated in HS-stressed plants, suggesting that fungus takes advantage of the increased phenylpropanoid precursors produced under stress. Pectate lyase was up-regulated while a putative amylase was down-regulated in planta, this could be associated with an intercellular growth strategy during the first stages of .L. theobromae transcriptome was established and validated. Its usefulness was demonstrated through the identification of genes expressed during the infection process. Our results support the hypothesis that heat stress facilitates fungal , because of the fungus ability to use the phenylpropanoid precursors and SA, both compounds known to control host defense.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26012780>Pilot study on novel skin care method by augmentation with Staphylococcus epidermidis, an autologous skin microbe--A blinded randomized clinical trial.</a></h2><p>Staphylococcus epidermidis is an autologous bacterium that is beneficial to skin health. Our goal was to develop a novel, personalized basic cosmetic that exploits this characteristic.We conducted a double-blinded, randomized clinical trial on augmentation with S. epidermidis as a pilot study, in which S. epidermidis was collected from the subject, cultured for proliferation, and then continuously applied to the subject's own face before sleep twice per week for four weeks in order to increase  levels.The results showed that this treatment increased the lipid content of the skin and suppressed water evaporation, thereby markedly improving skin moisture retention. Moreover, augmentation with S. epidermidis maintained a low acidic condition on the skin surface. The low risk of undesirable effects induced by augmentation with S. epidermidis was also confirmed by measuring erythema and melanin levels.These results may serve as a driving force to accelerate the development of novel, personalized basic cosmetics.Copyright © 2015 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

At the same time, nasopharyngeal  with Spn has been shown to mount adaptive immune responses against Spn in mice and humans. Cellular responses of the nasopharyngeal compartment, including the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue, to pneumococcal  and their importance for developing adaptive immune responses are poorly defined. We show that nasopharyngeal  with S. pneumoniae led to substantial expansion of dendritic cells (DCs) both in nasopharyngeal tissue and nasal-associated lymphoid tissue of mice. Depletion of DCs achieved by either diphtheria toxin (DT) treatment of chimeric zDC mice, or by use of FMS-like  kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) KO mice exhibiting congenitally reduced DC pool sizes, significantly diminished antibody responses after  with Spn, along with impaired protective immunity against invasive pneumococcal disease. Collectively, the data show that classical DCs contribute to pneumococcal  induced adaptive immune responses against invasive pneumococcal disease in two different mouse models. These data may be useful for future nasopharyngeal vaccination strategies against pneumococcal diseases in humans.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Metal-dependent protein  phosphatases that belong to the polymerase and histindinol phosphatase (PHP) family are widespread in Gram-positive bacteria. Here, we show that , a Gram-negative periodontal pathogen, expresses a PHP protein, Php1, with divalent metal ion-dependent  phosphatase activity. Php1  phosphatase activity was attenuated by mutation of conserved histidine residues that are important for the coordination of metal ions and by mutation of a conserved arginine residue, a key residue for catalysis in other bacterial PHPs. The  gene is located immediately downstream of the gene encoding the bacterial  (BY) kinase Ptk1, which was a substrate for Php1  Php1 rapidly caused the conversion of Ptk1 to a state of low  phosphorylation in the absence of discernible intermediate phosphoforms. Active Php1 was required for  exopolysaccharide production and for community development with the antecedent oral biofilm constituent  under nutrient-depleted conditions. In contrast, the absence of Php1 had no effect on the ability of  to form monospecies biofilms. , Php1 enzymatic activity was resistant to the effects of the streptococcal secreted metabolites pABA and HO, which inhibited Ltp1, an enzyme in the low-molecular-weight (LMW) phosphotyrosine phosphatase family. Ptk1 reciprocally phosphorylated Php1 on  residues 159 and 161, which independently impacted phosphatase activity. Loss of Php1 rendered  nonvirulent in an animal model of periodontal disease. Collectively, these results demonstrate that  possesses active PHP and LMW  phosphatases, a unique configuration in Gram-negatives which may allow  to maintain phosphorylation/dephosphorylation homeostasis in multispecies communities. Moreover, Php1 contributes to the pathogenic potential of the organism. Periodontal diseases are among the most common infections of humans and are also associated with systemic inflammatory conditions.  and pathogenicity of  are regulated by signal transduction pathways based on protein  phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Here, we identify and characterize a novel component of the  (de)phosphorylation axis: a polymerase and histindinol phosphatase (PHP) family enzyme. This  phosphatase, designated Php1, was required for  community development with other oral bacteria, and in the absence of Php1 activity  was unable to cause disease in a mouse model of periodontitis.

More recently, the case has been made that the critical last step in metastasis is dependent on the ability to undergo reversion to an epithelial phenotype in a process known as the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). It is this transition in the metastatic cascade that researchers are focusing on clinically to treat disseminated disease. Shinde and colleagues identified spleen  kinase (SYK) as a critical mediator of MET that facilitated the removal of P-bodies during autophagy. Remarkably, pharmacologic inhibition of SYK inhibited the clearance of P-bodies and autophagy in preclinical models of metastasis, arresting cancer cells in an indefinite dormant state and preventing tumor cell  and thus the establishment of aggressive metastatic disease..©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29445733>Route of Injection Affects the Impact of InlB Internalin Domain Variants on Severity of  Infection in Mice.</a></h2><p>The facultative intracellular pathogen  causes a severe food-borne infection in humans and animals.  invasion factor InlB interacts with the  kinase c-Met via the N-terminal internalin domain. Previously, distinct variants of the InlB internalin domain (idInlB) have been described in  field isolates. Three variants were used to restore full-length InlB expression in the  strain EGDeΔ. Obtained isogenic  strains were tested in the invasion assay and intravenous, intraperitoneal, and intragastric models of infection in mice. All idInlBs were functional, restored InlB activity as an invasion factor, and improved invasion of the parental strain EGDeΔinlB into human kidney HEK23 cells. Meanwhile, distinct idInlBs provided different mortality rates and bacterial loads in internal organs. When recombinant strains were compared, the variant designated idInlB14 decreased severity of disease caused by intravenous and intraperitoneal bacterial administration, whereas this variant improved intestine  and stimulated intragastric infection. Obtained results demonstrated that naturally occurring idInlBs differed in their impact on severity of  infection in mice in dependence on the infection route.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28160109>Antimetastatic pectic polysaccharide from Decalepis hamiltonii; galectin-3 inhibition and immune-modulation.</a></h2><p>Melanoma is a malignant neoplasm of major concern because of its high mortality rate and failure of chemotherapy. Previously we have shown that galectin-3, a galactose specific lectin, plays a pivotal role in the initiation of metastasis. It was hypothesized that blocking galectin-3 with galactose rich dietary pectic polymer would inhibit metastasis. The current study analyzes the preventive effect and mode of action of a pectic polymer from Swallow Root (Decalepis hamiltonii) in a preventative study of B16F10 cells lung . Matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) activity was assayed by zymography. Apoptotic/proliferative markers and cytokines were analyzed by immunoassay. Results indicated ~88% inhibition of lung  by SRPP as compared to 60% by CPP and only 7% by GRPP. Further molecular analysis revealed that galectin-3 blockade was associated with down regulation of MMPs and NFκB. Activation of caspases supported the apoptotic effect of SRPP. Infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lung was evidenced by presence of CD11b cells and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine-IL-17, indicating inflammation during the cancer cell  process. SRPP enhanced the release of IL-12 that enables the reduction of inflammation. Our data for the first time indicate the effective anti-metastatic effect of SRPP due to both galectin-3 blockade and immunomodulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29928143>Mechanism of metastasis suppression by luteolin in breast cancer.</a></h2><p>Metastatic breast cancer is typically an extremely aggressive cancer with poor prognosis. Metastasis requires the orchestration of homeostatic factors and cellular programs, many of which are potential therapeutic targets. Luteolin (2-[3,4-dihydroxyphenyl]-5,7-dihydroxy-4-chromenone), is a naturally occurring flavonoid found in fruits and vegetables that exhibits many anticancer properties. Luteolin obstructs metastasis through both direct and indirect mechanisms. For instance, luteolin may suppress breast cancer invasion by acting as an antiangiogenic therapeutic inhibiting VEGF production and its receptor's activity. Furthermore, luteolin decreases epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers and metastatic proclivity. Luteolin also acts as an antiproliferative by suppressing receptor -kinase activity and apoptosis, both of which could prevent incipient  of breast cancer. Many of these antimetastatic characteristics accredited to luteolin are likely functionally related. For instance, the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is impeded by luteolin, has several downstream programs involved in increased proliferation, survival, and metastatic potential in breast cancer. In this review, luteolin's ability to ameliorate breast cancer is summarized. The paper also offers insight into the molecular mechanisms by which luteolin may suppress breast cancer metastasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29301934>The  effector Ceg4 is a phosphotyrosine phosphatase that attenuates activation of eukaryotic MAPK pathways.</a></h2><p>Host  by Gram-negative pathogens often involves delivery of bacterial proteins called "effectors" into the host cell. The pneumonia-causing pathogen  delivers more than 330 effectors into the host cell via its type IVB Dot/Icm secretion system. The collective functions of these proteins are the establishment of a replicative niche from which  can recruit cellular materials to grow while evading lysosomal fusion inhibiting its growth. Using a combination of structural, biochemical, and  approaches, we show that one of these translocated effector proteins, Ceg4, is a phosphotyrosine phosphatase harboring a haloacid dehalogenase-hydrolase domain. Ceg4 could dephosphorylate a broad range of phosphotyrosine-containing peptides  and attenuated activation of MAPK-controlled pathways in both yeast and human cells. Our findings indicate that 's infectious program includes manipulation of phosphorylation cascades in key host pathways. The structural and functional features of the Ceg4 effector unraveled here provide first insight into its function as a phosphotyrosine phosphatase, paving the way to further studies into  pathogenicity.</p></html>
